CMC had no scientific system to recycle: Champika
	
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said today the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) did not have a scientific methodology for garbage recycling.
He told parliament that the CMC had some 70 officials who were qualified enough to provide technical assistance on garbage recycling.
The minister said the Meethotamulla catastrophe had occurred because of several reasons including the continuous dumping of garbage in the area without any scientific methodology and the instability of the ecosystem by way of floods.
He said steps would be taken to stabilise the Meethotamulla garbage dump during the next six months so that there would be no reason to fear any further collapse.
He said there was a need to set up scientific waste management plants in the country such as the one in Dompe and requested all stakeholders to support these moves. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Collective TU action between May 3 and 5: GMOA
	
The Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) today warned it would resort to a 24-hour trade union action on a day between May 3 and 5 if its demands regarding the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) were not granted.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Nalinda Herath told a media briefing that they arrived at this decision on the unanimous approval of its central committee.
?Several trade unions including those of teachers, the transport sector and the railways have joined hands with us in this battle. Many services in the country will come to a standstill on that day and will directly affect the country as well. We do not intend to inconvenience the people by our TU action,? he said.
He said they would launch a series of trade union action from May 9 if the government did not provide them a reasonable answer to this matter.
He said they were not prepared to have any discussion with President Maithripala Sirisena or any other party on this matter because the discussions held earlier had resulted in failure.
?SAITM should be nationalized. That is the only solution to this issue. Many of the doctors, university students and trade unions are not happy with the decisions taken by the government on this matter,? he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Le Pen uses guerrilla tactics to unsettle Macron
	
PARIS AFP April27, 2017 French far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen hopped on to a fishing boat at dawn on Thursday as she pursued a guerrilla-style campaign that has upstaged frontrunner Emmanuel Macron. ??
It was still dark when Le Pen boarded the trawler at the small port of Grau-du-Roi on the south coast for a four-hour trip out to sea, seeking to portray herself as the protector of small businesses against the man she says embodies ?unbridled globalisation?. ??
Le Pen stole a march on 39-year-old Macron on Wednesday by making an unannounced visit to a Whirlpool factory in northern France where the US appliances giant is threatening to partially outsource production to Poland. ??
Her brief visit to pose for selfies with workers forced Macron, who was visiting the town where the factory is based, to hastily change his plans and also go to the site. ? Le Pen, 48, was back on the attack on Thursday saying her rival, a former banker, supported ?an ultra-liberal economy? and ?total deregulation?. ??
Macron hit back in a Twitter message that reminded voters of the National Front (FN) candidate?s pledge to pull out of the Eurozone and hold a referendum on France?s membership of the European Union. ??
??Madame Le Pen has gone fishing. Have a good trip...? ? ?

NDB wins Brand Excellence, Social Media Marketing at CMO Golden Globe Awards
	
NDB, formerly known as National Development Bank, was a recognized development bank which financed long-term investments to many large-scale projects. After many years of spurring development in the country, NDB decided to capitalize on its strong brand equity and expand its services to be a fully-fledged commercial bank in Sri Lanka. ?As a result of bringing the NDB brand closer to individuals and society at large, a far-reaching brand evolvement was carried out. ?
With this idea in mind, the bank established a new identity with brand positioning across the bank both internally and externally. New brand values were introduced to staff internally and the bank witnessed employees reliving these values in their day-to-day work. ?The bank ventured in replacing its brand identity of being a ?development bank? to a bank that touches lives of individuals, families, communities, society, economy and the nation through a full array of banking services. To further strengthen its position, NDB launched its brand campaign ?Our Commitment. Your Success? last year. ? Today, NDB has managed to reach its objective of successfully reaching out and financially empowering Sri Lankans at very personal levels, ranging from large-scale corporates to providing working capital to food vendors on the Galle Face Green. As a testament of this success, the bank recently won the award for Brand Excellence within the Banking and Financial Services sector and also won another award for Social Media Marketing at the recently held CMO Golden Globe Brand Excellence Awards in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
Commenting on the receipt of the award, NDB Assistant Vice President Marketing Sanjaya Senarath said, ?We are happy to be recognized for the work done with thae brand last year where we positioned ourselves as a bank developing individuals, people, society, etc. We also introduced our new tag line ?Our Commitment. Your Success?. We are also humbly proud of making great strides digitally within a short time of just four years and to be recognized for its innovative and effective use of social media. Such accomplishments with long-term orientation have given NDB a significant competitive edge in the local banking sphere while earning international recognition today.?
NDB?s product offerings also extend to capital and investment banking products, delivered by the bank?s subsidiary entities. The amalgam of commercial banking, investment banking and capital market solutions has earned NDB the reputation of a unique financial group within the country.
With the vision to be ?the driving force for a financially empowered Sri Lanka?, the bank is committed to create superior shareholder value and to ensure success of all the stakeholders that join the bank in its success journey.?

## Title: Pan Asia Bank 1Q net profit up 16% to Rs.353mn
## Section: Financial News
## Date: 28 April 2017 10:12 am
Pan Asia Bank 1Q net profit up 16% to Rs.353mn
	
Mid-sized bank, Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC, reported an after tax profit of Rs.353.4 million for the March quarter (1Q17) recording an increase of 16 percent from the same period last year. ?
The performance was largely supported by the increase in the fee and commission income, slightly lower tax liability and the closer tab kept on the costs.?
However, the core-banking performance became subdued in response to the tighter credit conditions remained throughout the period. ??
The bank?s earnings per share was Rs.3.41 by end-1Q17, slightly less than Rs.3.91 reported in the same period of 2016 due to the increase in bank?s equity resulted by the Rs.2.0 billion rights issue in March 2017, which was promptly oversubscribed.?
Meanwhile, the income tax expense for the period came down by 12 percent to little under Rs.160 million for the quarter from a year ago as a result of effective tax management. ?
What is also notable is the fact that despite the new equity injection, the bank was able to maintain its return on equity (RoE) at 18.95 percent, which is among the highest in the industry, albeit slightly down from 19.97 percent reported three months ago.?
In spite of the mounting pressure on banking sector margins as a whole, the bank was largely able to maintain its net interest margin (NIM) at 3.79 percent, higher than the industry average of around 3.4 percent although slightly down from its December?s 3.87 percent.?
Speaking on the bank?s recent performance, the bank?s newly appointed Director/Chief Executive Officer Nimal Tillekeratne said this performance was a true reflection of the bank?s and ability to report consistently higher financial performance even amid challenging conditions. ?
?I am happy to announce our financial performance for the first quarter because the bank operated under less than favourable conditions such as rising interest rates, slowdown in demand for new loans and risk of new addition to non-performing loans,? he said. ?
Commenting further on the recent issue of rights, he confided that the bank could meet the minimum core-capital requirement of Rs.10 billion by end-2017 with the strong earnings forecasted for the remainder of the year.?
By end-March 31, 2017, the bank had a core capital base of Rs.8.7 billion and a total capital base of Rs.10.5 billion. ?
Also, both Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratios received a boost from the recent rights issue proceeds of Rs.2.0 billion and by end-March 31, 2017, the two ratios stood at 11.07 percent and 13.83 percent, respectively, significantly up from 8.37 percent and 11.40 percent in December 2016.?
The bank?s core-banking performance was impacted by the tightening monetary and fiscal conditions because higher interest rates and higher indirect taxes dampened the demand for new loans.
Although the interest income rose by a strong 36 percent to Rs.3.89 billion from a year ago, the corresponding interest expense grew by an even higher 54 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.2.68 billion resulting in net interest income (NII) of Rs.1.21 billion, an increase of a modest 7.0 percent from a year earlier.?
The low-cost deposit base measured by the current and savings account (CASA) ratio also declined to 19.6 percent from 20.3 percent in December as the mid-term deposits grew much faster. ?
Net fee and commission income acted as an important anchor to guard against the tightened NIIs as such income grew by a strong 63 percent YoY to Rs.339.95 million. ?
This was predominantly due to credit-related fee income and partly due to the fee income from credit cards.?
As a result of productivity and efficiency enhancement activities pursued during the last four years, the bank was able to bring down its cost-to-income ratio to 54.24 percent from 56.03 percent three months ago.?
Meanwhile, the return on assets also rose to 1.11 percent from 1.05 percent in December.?
The staff cost rose by little under 10 percent mainly due to the increased salaries and other emoluments while the other expenses rose by 16 percent due to the generally increase in price levels and indirect taxes.?
The bank is now on an aggressive staff rationalization programme, which will see excess head office staff being redeployed to the branch network, which will be expanded up to 100 within the next 18 months.?
The bank?s total assets remained largely unchanged at Rs.129.12 billion during the quarter under review as the growth in both loans and deposits slowed down in response to higher interest rates.?
Both loans and advances and deposits grew by little above Rs.2.0 billion to Rs.100.5 billion and Rs.93.8 billion, respectively.?
The asset quality came under slight pressure due to new additions to non-performing loans (NPLs) amid slow down in loans. Therefore, the gross NPL ratio rose to 5.63 percent from 4.74 percent in December but the bank is confident that the ratio could be brought down with the appropriate strategies already in place.

People elected this Govt., not TUs, to govern Sri Lanka: JHU
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said yesterday that it was not to the trade unions but to this government that the people gave a mandate to administer the country.
JHU General Secretary and Minister Champika Ranawaka told a news conference that a small group of people should not be allowed to disrupt the essential services of the country and added that it was the responsibility of the government to ensure these services are supplied uninterrupted.
?We should not allow a small group of people to disrupt the essential services of the country. There should be constructive engagement in every sector. We cannot and should not allow people to disrupt the supply of electricity, water and fuel without prior notice,? he said.
The minister said trade union and social rights were two different matters and trade unions should not be allowed to hold people hostage to win their demands.
?Political or trade union issues, should be resolved through discussions. They cannot act indiscriminately. This is precisely what happened during the former regime. These groups should hold discussions with the relevant authorities before resorting to trade union action. People are inconvenienced because of this mindless behaviour. We need to respond to these matters as a responsible government,? he said adding that they should be resolved beyond party politics.
When asked about President Maithripala Sirisena's proposal to appointment of Minister Sarath Fonseka as Army Commander or overall security forces commander for two years, JHU Co-Chairman and Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana said it was only a Cabinet proposal and not a Cabinet decision.
?We are unsure as to what the President has in mind. He has not specifically said the role be given to Mr. Fonseka. It is only a suggestion. He will reveal the details if any in time to come. This proposal is not aimed at attacking trade unions. However, the government has to obtain the services of the Army to ensure uninterrupted essential services when trade unions stage protests on each and every issue. The President must have thought of appointing the most suitable military person to the post. This is not against good governance,? the deputy minister said.
Meanwhile, commenting on the JHU May Day rally, the minister said the JHU would begin its rally from Pettah at 11.00 a.m. with the participation of the working class including porters. (Ajith Siriwardana)

President calls for global ban on firearms
	
Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday called for the worldwide banning of firearms highlighting that it is the main cause for conflicts around the globe in the current scenario.
The President made this point at the opening of the International Islamic Conference organized by the Sri Lanka Islamic Centre and the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Islamic Affairs D?awath in Colombo last morning.
?In my opinion we will be able to build a conflict-free world if the manufacturers of firearms take up a different line of business to earn a living. It is the manufacturers of firearms that should be brought to the negotiating table,? he said.
Besides, he said the solutions to world?s conflicts should come through those who strive to uphold moral values and not from the politicians. ?Any sacred writings, be it the Tripitaka, Bible, Quran or the Bagawath Geetha teach the mankind how to uphold moral values and live a peaceful lives. It is these teachings which could bring solutions to the global conflicts,? the President said.
Focusing on the Sri Lankan scenario, he said it was sad that leaders of all ethnic groups in this country who struggled together to gain independence from Britain had got into conflicts with each other after gaining independence in 1948. The President therefore called for the support of Islamic religious leaders who participated in the conference to support the government?s efforts to bring in peace and reconciliation.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the efforts of Islamic leaders who participated in the conference was important in resolving the tension that had arisen in the world today. He said the theme of the conference? Islamic Reality and Contemporary challenges? was very valuable. Further he told the international Islamic leaders that Sri Lanka was a multi religious and multi ethnic country which respect each other.
Posts and Muslim Religious Affairs Minister M H A Haleem and state Minister A H M Fowze who also spoke at the conference stressed that Islamic leaders would have to counter the Islamophobia that is prevailing in the globe which has emerged as a result of false ideologies on Islam.

## Title: Sade Sati or Shani Erashtaka Saturn?s dreaded Malefic  period
## Section: Jyotisha News

Sade Sati or Shani Erashtaka Saturn?s dreaded Malefic  period
	
?
By Sandagomi
Shani or Senasuru Erashtaka is a familiar term to people in Sri Lanka. ?In Vedic Astrology Shani Erashtaka is referred to as Sade Sati.?
People in our country also know that Saturn is the most malefic or evil of all planets.?
?
Peculiar to Saturn
There are several other planets like the Sun, Mars, Rahu and Ketu who are considered natural malefics, but Vedic Astrology has not assigned a particular malefic period to them during their transit through the 12 signs of the Zodiac or the 12 Bhavas (Houses) in the Horoscope. ?Therefore, Erashtaka or malefic period is something peculiar to Saturn.
?
Three different Erashtakas
Saturn, according to Vedic Astrology, causes three types of Erashtaka. They are Lagna Erashtaka, Ashtamaya Erashtaka and Jamma Erashtaka. ?Of these three evil periods the most malefic one is Jamma Erashtaka.?
Jamma Erashtaka signifies either Saturn conjoining the Moon in a sign at birth or Saturn?s advent to the sign the ? Moon occupies during its journey through the Zodiac. The advent of Saturn to the sign previous to the sign which the Moon occupies at birth marks the beginning of Jamma Erashtaka. ?Saturn?s transit in the sign which the Moon occupied at birth is considered the mid-part of the Erashtaka. ?Saturn?s transit in the sign next to it is the last part of the malefic period. ?The Erashtaka ends with Saturn leaving the last of the three signs. ?For example, say, the Moon occupied the Aries (Mesha) sign at birth. The Shani Erashtaka would begin when Saturn enters Pisces (Meena) sign. The Erashtaka would end only when Saturn leaves the sign next to Aries i.e. Taurus (Vrushabha).
Saturn takes about 2 ? years to travel past one sign in the Zodiac. ?Therefore, the length of Shani Erashtaka is about 7 ? years. ?Ashtamaya Shani Erashtaka is an exception to this general rule, duration of which is restricted to 2 ? years.?
A native would come under the Lagna Shani Erashtaka either when Saturn is placed in the Lagna with the Moon at birth or when Saturn travels in the sign before the Lagna ? the 12th House, in the Lagna and in the sign next to it or in the 2nd House. In the first case, the Erashtaka runs for about 5 years and in the latter case its duration is 7 ? years.?
Ashtamaya Shani Erashtaka is Saturn?s transit in the 8th House in the horoscope. The duration of this Erashtaka as stated before is only 2 ? years.?
?
Principle governing Ashtamaya Erashtaka
The principle relating to the duration of the other two Erashtaka, Jamma and Lagna does not apply to this Erashtaka due to valid reasons. ?The House next to the 8th is the 9th which is a trine or a Moolatrikona in the horoscope where even malefic planets produce favourable results. ?Saturn, despite being a malefic planet would not normally produce evil results when he occupies the 9th House. ?The House before the 8th is the 7th. ?Saturn is powerful in the 7th House and he commands Digbala in this House. Normally he would not produce evil results when he is in the 7th House. This explains why the Ashtamaya Erashtaka duration is restricted to 2 ? years.?
?
Signs that mitigate the evil effects of Saturn
It is noteworthy that Saturn would not cause serious harm to the native when he is passing through certain signs. They are: Libra, Sagittarius, Capricorn and Aquarius. ?Saturn causes maximum possible damage to the native when he passes through the sign of Cancer.
?
There are good reasons why Saturn is partial to the signs, Libra, Sagittarius, Capricorn and Aquarius. ?Saturn attains exaltation in Libra. Sagittarius is the favorite sign ruled by Jupiter and Saturn becomes powerless to cause evil when he is in this sign. ?Capricorn and Aquarius are ruled by Saturn himself and he?normally causes no evil when he is occupying his own abodes.

Secrets that the Thumb reveals
	
Human Hand ? Trailblazer of Human Civilization ? Part 6
?
By A.S. Fernando
The Thumb as in the case of fingers is divided into three main parts. These three parts described as phalanges like those of the fingers represent three worlds, embodying three supreme qualities, says renowned palmistry expert Psycho. They are: Willpower and Determination as shown by the first or the nail phalanx, Reason and Logic by the second and Love and Sympathy by the third or the Mount of Venus.
According to Psycho, the special attributes of the first phalanx are will power, decision- making and the ability to command others and those of the second are perception, judgment, and reasoning faculties. The attributes of the third phalanx are love, sympathy and passion.
Indian experts in Palmistry describe the first phalanx of the Thumb as ?Sat?, the second as -Raj? and the third as -Tam?. They say that the first phalanx is indicative of science and willpower, the middle or the second part shows logic and thinking capacity and the third love, attraction and affection. Despite there being a difference in the use of phraseology in describing the attributes of the three phalanges of the thumb, both Psycho of the West and experts in India say the same thing substantially.
The first phalanx: A person whose first phalanx is longer than the second phalanx is endowed with willpower and the ability to take independent decisions. Such persons do not like to work as subordinates. They usually possess a majestic personality. They lead a more contented and happier life in old age than when they are young.
The second phalanx: This phalanx of the Thumb represents the power of reasoning, or logic. If the second phalanx of a person is stronger and bigger than the first, he would command such reasoning power seldom one would dare challenge him. Very often they are not reasonable people. They are not prepared to give way, even if they are proved wrong. They are more bent on winning a debating point than seeking the truth. They are not respected in any society.
When this phalanx is thin, the owner would be a garrulous, loose-tongued person who ?would blurt out whatever that comes to his mind. Therefore, what this type of persons say is not taken seriously. The pastime of this type of persons very often is finding fault with their superiors behind their back.
If the first and second phalanges of a person are equal in length, width, and thickness, he would be a cool-headed person who remains unruffled under all circumstances. He is very sober and would face both praise and abuse with equanimity. These persons are endowed with self-confidence. They are not gullible and cannot be misled or cheated.
Persons whose second phalanx is thinner and weaker in comparison to the first phalanx are those incapable of doing any work without guidance and supervision. They do not have definite ideas and are unreliable.
The third phalanx: This phalanx is not a phalanx like others. It is really the Mount of Venus. Persons having a comparatively prominent and elegant Mount of Venus are cultured persons with refined manners. Such persons are popular and are respected in the society.
People with an unusually prominent Mount of Venus are promiscuous and very passionate. They would not be faithful to the spouse.
When the Mount of Venus is depressed and hardly noticeable, and there are too many lines on the area, the owner would be a frustrated lover. He is not respected in society. He has to face many problems in married life.

## Title: Sri Lanka rules may boost capital, mergers for small NBFIs: Fitch

Sri Lanka rules may boost capital, mergers for small NBFIs: Fitch
	
The new regulations issued by Sri Lanka?s Central Bank to increase minimum core capital levels for all licensed finance companies could spur small companies to improve their capital buffers and may reignite industry consolidation, says Fitch Ratings.
Fitch believes the new directive is likely to address the need for higher capital buffers for the non?bank financial institutions (NBFI) sector as a whole to ensure financial system stability, given our expectation of a deterioration in asset quality and capitalisation in the sector following aggressive loan book growth in recent years and persistent weak operating conditions.?
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka issued a directive in February 2017 requiring all licensed finance companies to increase their minimum core capital levels to Rs.2.5 billion by end?2020 in stages from the current Rs.400 million, with the first target of Rs.1 billion to be reached by January 1, 2018.?
Capitalisation for the NBFI sector remains relatively low, with the core capital ratio at around 11.7 percent at end?September 2016. This level of capitalisation is similar to that of the banking sector, but we feel insufficient, as NBFIs have higher risk appetite than banks. At end?September 2016, finance companies? reported six?month nonperforming loans (NPLs) accounted for 5.4 percent of total advances, compared with the three?month ratio of 2.9 percent for the banking sector. Fitch estimates that the ratio could be much higher for the finance companies at a three months level.?
The new rules follow a previous plan to bring about financial sector consolidation, which did not significantly reduce the number of finance companies. There were 58 NBFIs covered by the ?Master Plan for the Consolidation of the Financial Sector? in 2014?2015, some of which merged with larger finance companies or were acquired by banks. The sector currently comprises 46 licensed finance companies, of which the 20 largest ones accounted for about 80 percent of the sector?s assets as of end-September 2016.
Based on publicly available information within the top 20, nine companies? core capital were below the Rs.2.5 billion mark but above the intermediate target of Rs.1 billion as of March 2016, while one company had negative core capital. Fitch estimates there are at least 18 small finance companies each with an asset base of less than Rs.10 billion at end?September 2016; among these, 12 had an equity base (approximated core capital calculated as equity less capital reserves based on publicly available information) of less than Rs.1 billion.
Further, eight of the finance companies in the sector are fully or partly owned subsidiaries of banks. As of September 2016, four of these fell short of the January 1, 2018 target. We do not expect the banks? credit profiles to be significantly affected by the capital injections they may have to make in their finance?company subsidiaries from time to time.?
Among the Fitch?rated entities, all 12 met the intermediate target of Rs.1 billion due by January 1, 2018 as of end?2016, although six fell short of the final target. We believe most of the relatively larger finance companies are likely to reach the required capital levels through internal capital generation within the stipulated time frame but nearly all the small finance companies are likely to require capital injections or will have to be merged with larger entities with stronger capital.

Thajudeen Murder: CID probes info revealed by individual informants
	
The CID yesterday informed court that it had deployed special investigative groups to examine the facts obtained from individual informants regarding a few suspicious persons in connection with the murder of Wasim Thajudeen.
The prosecution was of the view that based on the informants? revelations, the investigations are being conducted more towards the suspicious phone conversations of those identified persons and their unusual behaviour after the victim was killed on May 17,2012.
Meanwhile, acceding the prosecution?s request, the Court issued directions to Genetech Institute to send the 19 femur bone pieces and seven bone pieces of chest area recovered earlier at the SAITM to the Court to name them as case productions in the inquiry.
Earlier those 26 bone pieces were tested with the DNAs of Thajudeen's mother to verify if there were any victim?s body parts among the recovered bones. However, the test was negative.
The CID also filing a further report informed court that it had recently recorded statements from 25 officials, who were attached to the former President?s Security Division, over the improper removal of pages from the ?Daily Duty Information Book? of the President?s Security Division pertaining to the time period of May 10 to 22, 2012, which was the period when Wasim Thajudeen was killed.
They also said that a broad investigation was being conducted over the suspicious removal of pages and that 14 more security officials have been summoned to the CID in order investigate the matter.
The prosecution also said it had initiated an investigation to observe all phone conversations between May 16 and 17, which took place in the region where Thajudeen was killed.
Former SDIG Anura Senanayake and former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Perera had been charged under Sections 113 (Conspiracy) and 32 (Liability for act done by several persons in furtherance of a common intention) of the Penal Code by the prosecution.
They were also charged with causing the disappearance of evidence, fabricating false evidence, using it to shield the offender and conspiring under Clauses of 189,198 and 296 of the Penal Code
However, first suspect, Sumith Perera was granted bail by the Colombo High Court on an earlier occasion following a revision application filed on behalf of the suspect.
Considering that the suspect, Anura Senanayake had already filed revision bail applications in the High Court, Acting Magistrate Buddhika Sri Ragala re-remanded the suspect till May 4 and also directed the other suspect to appear in court on the date. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

TUs criticize SF?s appointment
	
A move to appoint Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka as the Army Commander or the Overall commander for two years, claiming to instill discipline in the country was highly criticized by several leading state trade unions including the GMOA, teachers? unions and labour unions.
?We were forced to go for an alliance with all trade unions with the government?s decision to appoint Sarath Fonseka to discipline the country,? they said.
The trade union alliance said the government had strengthened the TUs by moving their pawn Fonseka to the battlefield which gave them more courage to get together and reverse the government policy on SAITM and other efforts to privatize state education.
Addressing a media conference held in Colombo, GMOA Additional Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said the association had discussions with most of the key TUs in the country to work towards defeating what it called the government?s alleged double standards over private education institutions.
?It is the government that powered TUs toward this major move. Authorities will witness a series of protests and several other trade union actions paralyzing the country?s whole sectors. All trade unions have agreed unconditionally to support us to ensure the country?s education,? he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

US vows to force N.Korea back to nuclear talks
	
?
The United States pledged Wednesday to step up sanctions to force North Korea to resume dialogue over its nuclear program, but said it was not looking to bring Kim Jong-Un?s regime to its knees. ??
After briefing senators at the White House, top US officials said President Donald Trump also aimed to pursue diplomatic measures with allies and regional partners. ??
?Separately, a senior administration official told AFP that the United States is considering adding North Korea to its list of countries that are designated as ?state sponsors of terrorism.? US troops in South Korea began on Wednesday deploying a contentious anti-missile system in South Korea that has infuriated China. ??
The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is being set up on a former golf course in the southern county of Seongju, and its arrival was met by hundreds of protesters, some of whom clashed with police. ??
Harris said the THAAD system ?will be operational in the coming days.? China fears THAAD will weaken its own ballistic capabilities and says it upsets the regional security balance. ??
Harris also said the Pentagon should weigh whether to install missile interceptors on Hawaii, which could be one of the first parts of the United States in range of an improved North Korean missile, in addition to existing interceptors in California and Alaska. ?
