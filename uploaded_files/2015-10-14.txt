	Colombo District MP Hirunika Premachandra said today she could not complete some of the work she had initiated because the funds allocated for it by the Western Provincial Council were blocked by the then Chief Minister after she decided to support President Maithripala Sirisena at the last Presidential Election.
	Ms. Premachandra said she hoped that the present Chief Minister would release the funds allocated for her so that she could complete the work she had initiated.
	She expressed these views at an event to lay the foundation stone for sanitary facilities as well as several new houses which were to be built at at 63 Watte, a housing complex located at Wanathamulla, Borella, yesterday, organised as a part of her 28th birthday celebrations.
	?I saw that the sanitary facilities in this housing complex was in a dilapidated condition when I visited here one day and I decided to donate a new toilet for these people with my own funds,? she said.
	Ms. Premachandra noted that once the President and Prime Minister allocates funds through the decentralized budget she could make use of it for her welfare work on behalf of the people. (Ajith Siriwardana and Indika Sri Aravinda)

Janashakthi Insurance raises awareness on life insurance
	
Janashakthi Insurance reaffirmed its commitment to the nation by endeavouring to increase awareness on life insurance across the country. This was part of the Life Insurance Awareness Month campaign launched by the Insurance Association of Sri Lanka (IASL) and Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL). Held from September 1 to 30, the campaign aimed to reach one million people under the theme Get Life Live Life.
Janashakthi?s insurance advisors kicked off the campaign with town stormings in Ratnapura and Maharagama, educating the public on the benefits of life insurance. Drawing in bystanders with a live band and entertainers, they held interactive sessions on life insurance as a savings instrument that would offer them greater financial stability in the future, especially during their retirement years. They also apprised them of other insurance policies, such as child and education plans and healthcare protections.
?Only 12.6 percent of Sri Lankans are covered by a life insurance policy and even fewer have a comprehensive life policy. The unpredictability of life means that those families without an insurance policy risk financial hardships should a loved one get injured or fall ill. Thus, we see this campaign as an important initiative to improve on those numbers and create a long-term positive impact on the nation. Our mission is to bring hope and prosperity to all. And we view this initiative as helping us fulfil that mission. By educating people on the benefits and importance of a life insurance policy, we are giving them the tools to tame risk and stave off future financial hardships,? said Janashakthi Insurance PLC General Manager Life Sales and Operations Hashra Weerawardena.
?We got together with other leading insurance companies in the country. Our teams spread the message of insurance and its importance to the public across different locations in Ratnapura and Maharagama. Engaging with the public at this level allowed us to not only raise awareness but also do away with any misunderstandings they may have had about life insurance,? added Weerawardena.

Tamil Tiger in Toronto ordered to deport for terrorism
	
	A member of the Tamil Tigers who was allegedly sent to Toronto to run the Sri Lankan guerrilla group?s Canadian front organization has been ordered deported for terrorism, according to documents filed in the Federal Court.
	The government has been trying to deport Manickavasagam Suresh since 1995, when he was first arrested in Toronto. The case was thought to have languished but last week the case reappeared on the court docket.
	The Immigration and Refugee Board declined to comment Tuesday. But in an application filed in Toronto on Oct. 5, Suresh asked Federal Court to overturn an IRB decision ?in which Mr. Suresh was found inadmissible to Canada.?
	The decision was received Sept. 17, according to the documents, which indicate that Suresh was found inadmissible under sections of the immigration law that allow for the deportation of members of terrorist groups and those engaged in terrorism.
	Lawyers representing Suresh wrote in their application that they wanted to argue that the IRB erred by finding that he had ?engaged in terrorism,? was ?complicit in terrorism,? and that there had not been an ?abuse of process.?
	The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, or LTTE, allegedly tasked Suresh with running the World Tamil Movement, a non-profit that Canadian officials said had ?raised significant funds? for the rebels.
	His arrest in 1995 was approved by the then-Liberal government of Jean Chr?tien. The Federal Court of Appeal upheld the case, writing that, ?Those who freely choose to raise funds to sustain terrorist organizations bear the same guilt and responsibility as those who actually carry out terrorist acts.?
	But Suresh appealed to the Supreme Court, which overturned his deportation order in 2002, ruling that the security threat he posed to Canada had to be balanced against the threat of torture he faced upon his return to his home country.
	The government appeared to have backed off Suresh, 60, who lived in Mississauga, Ont. and was working as a computer engineer. The new case, however, indicates that officials have continued their attempts to remove him from Canada.
	IRB spokeswoman Anna Pape said she could neither confirm nor deny any information about the Suresh case. A copy of the IRB?s reasons has not yet been filed in the court so it was unclear why it had approved his deportation at this time.
	But in January, Sri Lankans elected a new president Maithripala Sirisena, widely considered more reform-friendly than his predecessor Mahinda Rajapaksa, whose 2009 military defeat of the Tamil Tigers killed an untold number of civilians.
	Much has changed since Suresh was first arrested two decades ago. The World Tamil Movement was dismantled following an RCMP investigation called Project Osaluki that found evidence the group had funneled millions to the rebels. The WTM was added to Canada?s list of terrorist entities in 2008.
	?The leadership of the WTM acts at the direction of the LTTE and has been instrumental in fundraising in Canada on behalf of the LTTE,? reads the listing on the Public Safety Canada website. ?WTM representatives canvas for donations amongst the Canadian Tamil population, and have been involved in acts of intimidation and extortion to secure funds.?
	His lawyer, Barbara Jackman, declined to comment.(National Post)

## Title: A renewed life for senior citizens with Pan Asia Bank?s ?Sammana? loan

A renewed life for senior citizens with Pan Asia Bank?s ?Sammana? loan
	
In an era senior citizens were largely considered as a liability by society and overlooked by the financial sector, Pan Asia Bank has come forward to offer the ?Sammana? loan scheme, which has given government pensioners the financial independence when such empowerment seemed least possible.
Pan Asia Bank?s ?Sammana? loan scheme offers facilities up to Rs.1 million for the pensioners as well as for the retired Central Bank employees with no security requirements.?
Being the pioneer in introducing this loan scheme into the market two years ago, the bank has now offered financial assistance to a larger retired populace and thus commands the largest market share in this segment.?
Coinciding with the National Pensioners? Day on October 8, Pan Asia Bank is now gearing up to offer even more attractive value additions to the ?Sammana? loans scheme.
Speaking on these initiatives, the bank?s Deputy General Manager Retail Banking and SME Naleen Edirisinghe said the bank is intending to add a lot of new features which will further benefit the country?s senior citizens to lead a worry-free retirement while meeting their financial commitments.
?This loan scheme is available for government sector pensioners below 70 years of age who receive a monthly pension of Rs.10,000 or above. A simplified process is introduced to the applicants by omitting the requirement for guarantors or any mortgage facilities.
All they have to do is to transfer the monthly pension to Pan Asia Bank,? Edirisinghe said.?
According to Edirisinghe the loan scheme was a long-felt need in the market as no other bank or financial institute was prepared to offer a loan to the pensioners in this country.?
?In fact, until we saw the opportunity, nobody in the industry saw our pensioners as a viable segment, who need the financial assistance. Most others look at them as a risk to the financial system but we saw an immense potential in them,? he added.?
Besides the business and social responsibility dimensions associated with ?Sammana?, this also contributed towards the revival of economic activities in the country by way of providing seed capital to commence cottage industries by the retirees.
This is because the loan is mainly granted to empower self-employment among the pensioners enabling them to re-enter the work force as an income generator instead of relying purely on monthly pension or an interest income.?
?There are many people among us who aspire to start their own business in the areas of their specialization once they retire but fall short of realizing their dreams only because of inadequate capital.?
But now, if anyone wants to start their own business, the ?Sammana? loan provides them with the required capital with ease of mind from having to give securities and higher interest rates,? he explained. ?
In addition, the loan can also be used for any other purpose such as a wedding, higher education of a child, house renovations, pilgrimages, etc.?
Unlike applying for any other loan, applying for ?Sammana? is quite straightforward because it only requires the applicant to transfer his monthly pension to a Pan Asia Bank account.?
On top of that, the bank offers a very attractive interest rate of 5.5 percent for the ?Sammana? savings account.?
?We are contemplating of offering many other benefits which we feel will be of useful to our senior citizens,? Edirisinghe added.?
The applicant would also receive an ATM Visa debit card and an array of benefits such as Internet banking facility.?
Customers who obtain this loan will also get a special insurance policy.
?This insurance policy ensures that in an event of a customer?s untimely demise before the loan is paid off, his/her family is not burdened with the liability of the remainder of the loan.
Under this scheme, loans up to Rs.1,000,000 could be obtained with repayment periods up to seven years.?
The loan amount per applicant is decided based on the monthly pension, whereas the monthly installment will not exceed 60 percent of the monthly pension. A pensioner who earns Rs.10,000 is eligible for a loan of Rs.315,000,? he added.?
?Creation of a special product for pensioners is an initiative keeping in mind a sector that contributed so much to the upliftment of society throughout their lives,? he finally said.?
