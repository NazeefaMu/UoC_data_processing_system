A rattled Washington braces for whatever might come next
	
?
By Michael Scherer (c) 2017, The Washington Post ? Oct 31, 2017 -? ?
WASHINGTON - The hardest part for official Washington, D.C., is not knowing what happens next.? ?
Amid the fast-moving criminal investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election, every corner of the city finds itself preparing for the unexpected. Democrats fret that President Donald Trump might try to shut down the inquiry. Republicans worry that their last best hope for a legislative win, a tax overhaul, could fall victim to the scandal. And the president?s denial that his campaign worked in any way with Russia continues to be tested by new disclosures. The only person with any significant control over events, Special Counsel Robert Mueller, offered no hints Monday on his next move beyond the day?s bombshells - a series of legal filings, including the indictment of two former Trump campaign officials and the guilty plea of a third.And the possibilities seemed only to grow as the day wore on. Hours after the first indictments landed, a leading Democratic lobbyist, Tony Podesta, announced that he would leave his firm, after his firm?s apparent role in a Ukrainian lobbying campaign was described in court papers.? ?
The release of the charges followed the disclosure that a prominent Democratic lawyer and a news outlet backed by a major Republican donor had at different times paid a firm that compiled opposition research on Trump alleging ties to Russian interests that could threaten national security.? ?
Mueller has signaled that he will seek to turn every stone in his search and use all available legal tools. Monday?s court papers revealed that he had decided to file charges under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a nearly 80-year-old law that regulates lobbying for foreign powers but that rarely leads to criminal charges.? ?
Legal experts say the Mueller investigation is likely to bring more charges, not to mention a protracted legal process that is likely to distract from other priorities.? ?
Already, there are signs that the growing scandal has begun to distract from a key week for Republicans looking to build momentum behind tax legislation.? ?
On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., avoided questions from reporters on the indictments. At a separate event, House Speaker Paul Ryan said this when asked about the indictments: ?I really don?t have anything to add, other than nothing?s going to derail what we?re doing in Congress.?? ?
Even the president found himself caught off guard, when he prematurely tweeted his own absolution hours after indictments were announced of his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and a top deputy, Rick Gates. At 10:25 a.m., Trump felt it safe to boast that the announcements did not directly reference his campaign.? ?
?Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the campaign,? Trump wrote on Twitter. ?Also, there is NO COLLUSION!?? ?
?Minutes later, Mueller?s team announced a previously secret guilty plea of a third Trump campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, who worked on foreign policy in a volunteer capacity. In court papers, Papadopoulos described in detail his 2016 efforts to arrange contacts with people he knew to be Russian agents, including one person who had told him about Russian ?dirt? on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, including ?thousands of emails.?? ?
Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to giving false statements to federal agents in his initial interviews about the interactions. He now says that he discussed the Russian overtures he had received with several other people in the Trump campaign, including a ?senior policy adviser,? ?campaign supervisor? and a ?high-ranking campaign official.? Among the campaign officials he emailed were campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, campaign chairman Paul Manafort and national campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis.? ?
The campaign officials are not identified in court documents, but some of the emails cited by federal prosecutors match messages described in August to The Washington Post by people familiar with their contents.? ?
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders chose not to acknowledge that confession later in the day. ?Today?s announcement has nothing to do with the president, has nothing to do with the president?s campaign or campaign activity,? she said, arguing that the work by Papadopoulos to coordinate a Russian meeting with the campaign did not amount to a campaign effort.? ?
Podesta?s decision to leave his firm amounted to the first collateral damage for Democrats from the Russian investigation. One of the party?s most powerful lobbyists and effective fundraisers, he is also the brother of Clinton?s 2016 campaign chairman, John Podesta.? ?
The Manafort and Gates indictments described the efforts of ?Company B,? which appears to be Tony Podesta?s firm, the Podesta Group, to help the government of Ukraine. A principal from Podesta?s firm is described as privately warning Gates that his talking points on work on the lobbying contract could be contradicted by ?lots of email traffic.?? ?
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer put out a warning to Trump not to interfere with the ongoing probe. ?If he does, Congress must respond swiftly, unequivocally and in a bipartisan way to ensure that the investigation continues,? he said in a statement.?

Angelo, Kusal and Asela fit for India tour
	
Sri Lanka Cricket yesterday announced that former Captain Angelo Mathews, Kusal Janith Perera and Asela Gunaratne would be fit for the tour of India this month.
?Angelo, Kusal and Asela have recovered from their injuries and are fit to go. All three of them will be considered for selection for the India series.? Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) CEO Ashley de Silva said yesterday.
Mathews has been in and out of the team due to injuries and has not played for Sri Lanka since he picked up a calf injury before the commencement of the Pakistan series. In addition Gunaratne has been out of the team since July when he broke his finger during the first day of the opening Test against India. Perera last played for Sri Lanka during the ICC Champions Trophy in June when he hurt his hamstring during the match against India.
Sri Lanka?s tour of India which includes three Tests, three ODIs and three T20Is will commence on November 16.
Meanwhile, a Sri Lankan Team could return to Pakistan next June for an Asian Cricket Council (ACC) Emerging Tournament, with a possibility that Sri Lanka ?A? and Under-19 Teams also travel to Pakistan.
?The ACC Development Committee has decided to play the ACC Emerging Tournament in Pakistan next year,? de Silva said yesterday. ?That?s an indication alone where all the countries who participated at the meeting [stand]. They have given their consent to have the tournament in Pakistan and that [is an indication that] it is safe for the teams to travel to Lahore in future,? he said, though adding that he could not confirm if India would send a team.
?The decision has been taken and I?m sure all the countries will participate. If any country pulls out, the ACC will go ahead with the tournament, because the decision has been taken.?
De Silva also said that SLC would look at the possibility of sending ?A? and Under-19 teams to Pakistan in future.
?We haven?t got anything scheduled [for the National Team] in the Future Tours Programme. But we intend to consider sending our ?A? teams and Under-19s in time to come,? he said.(Shehan Daniel)

AT LEAST 200 PEOPLE KILLED AFTER TUNNEL COLLAPSES
	
At least 200 people have been killed at a nuclear test site in North Korea after a tunnel collapsed, according to an unverified Japanese media report.??
The collapse is said to have taken place during the construction of a new underground facility at the Punggye-ri site in northeastern North Korea on October 10, the report says.??
But there has been no official confirmation of the claims, apparently made by an unnamed North Korean ?source?.??
According to Japan?s TV Asahi, up to 100 people had been trapped in the tunnel and a further collapse happened during attempts to rescue them, raising the death toll to at least 200.The network claimed the incident was the result of the weakening of the ground surrounding the site in the wake of North Korea?s sixth nuclear test which was carried out at the same site.? ?
It comes a day after Seoul warned that one more North Korean nuclear detonation could destroy its mountain test site and trigger a radiation leak.??
South Korea says any future nuclear test by Kim Jong-un risks collapsing the location set aside for launching missiles.??

Constitutional Assembly unlawful: Wijeyadasa
	
UNP MP Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, who was removed from his Cabinet post a few months ago, broke his silence and said the Constitutional Assembly was totally unlawful.
In a lengthy statement, he said the present Constitution had not set out a procedure for the establishment of a Constitutional Assembly, and therefore it was virtually rendered null and void.
He said people, in voting for MPs, expected them to be knowledgeable in law making. The MP said former president late J.R. Jayewardene did not consult foreign experts paying them handsomely on constitution making.
He said it was tragic if such experts were paid colossal amounts of money and the MPs should be ashamed of it.

Courageous inmate aims at ?Masters?
	
A prison is a place where?criminals and killers are detained.?It sounds odd when we say that it is also a place to complete your studies. Although it sounds weird, we have recorded instances? where the above mentioned fact has come true.? ?
During an interview with The Daily Mirror, Superintendent of the Welikada Prison Chandana Ekanayake said that Indika Bamunusinghe, serving a life imprisonment after being sentenced to death, had graduated in his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree programme in Social Sciences from the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. At present he hopes to read for a Masters Degree (M.A.) in Social Sciences at the University of Kelaniya.? ?
The request made by this inmate to allow him to register with the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Kelaniya to commence his masters programme was endorsed by the Commissioner General of Prisons Nishantha Dhanasinghe. Bamunusinghe?s education, while serving his prison sentence, will be supervised by Ekanayake.? ?
It is my humble desire since childhood to graduate as a degree holder
?With reference to the conditions raised by the Commissioner General of Prisons, he isn?t permitted to attend lectures conducted at the university, but he will be provided with lecture notes and the opportunity to listen to lecture recordings in the prison itself,? Ekanayake said.? ?
Separate examination centre?
The faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Kelaniya has decided to conduct entrance exams from October 29 to December 09 for M.A. hopefuls. Bamunusinghe will attempt qualification at an exam conducted at a separate examination centre in the Welikada Prison premises.? ?
Bamunusinghe said that he was delighted to complete his B.A. and added that was expecting to read for his masters, thanks to the permission he has received for this task from the Welikada Prison authorities.? ?
?It is my humble desire since childhood to graduate as a degree holder. However, I couldn?t complete the degree at the due age owing to some allegations levelled against me. But I am satisfied that I was able to complete my B.A. at the age of 30 while still being in prison. Now I am 32. I will never lose my grip. But I am a little disappointed when I reflect on the state that I am in now. I am determined to continue with my studies regardless of the hardships I encounter,? Bamunusinghe said.? ?
He mentioned that many people had insulted and mocked at him querying as to how an individual behind bars could think of succeeding at a Masters degree.? ?
?He isn?t permitted to attend lectures conducted at the university, but he will be provided with lecture notes?
-Chandana Ekanayake
?
?
?
?
Rare privilege?
It is amazing to see him face this challenge with great fortitude and pursue his goal in education.? ?
?All the facilities required by the inmate to follow his studies would be provided for within the prison. He will also be assisted by a former university lecturer who is also an inmate,? the Superintendent of the Prison said.? ?
?This marks the first occasion in the history of the prison when an inmate sits for a qualification exam with the aim of reading for a Masters. Therefore, it is a rare privilege for the inmate and also the prison. We salute him and wish him well for all his endeavors. I should mention that this person has taught us a good lesson which is, ?Strive hard to achieve your goals irrespective of whatever condition you are in,? Ekanayake opined.? ?
This marks the first occasion in the history of the prison when an inmate sits for a qualification exam with the aim of reading for a Masters
Anxiety?
Students at any level should appreciate the commitment and dedication shown by Bamunusinghe. This is largely because this inmate has the minimum facilities to study for his examinations, given the state he is in now. Prison officials must be lauded for granting Bamunusinghe permission to pursue his studies.? ?
?We all harbour hopes in our lives. Courage and perseverance are required to attain them. I went through plenty of anxiety during my life?s journey, but I didn?t allow such conditions to distract nor discourage me,? Bamunusinghe said.? ?
Ekanayake told The? that an examination centre was also established within the prison for inmates who aspired to sit for the Dharmacharya Examination.? ?
?Four inmates sat for the exam on October 30 and they were provided with adequate facilities,? Ekanayake added.? Ekanayake added that those two happenings had motivated and provided inmates with the necessary incentive to rethink about education and continue from where they had stopped. Besides, he said that twenty inmates have got through their English Language at the Ordinary Level Examination held in 2016.?
We all harbour hopes in our lives. Courage and perseverance are required to attain them?
?Accordingly, eleven inmates have succeeded in obtaining a simple pass (S), a ?B? pass and ?C? passes at exams. It should be noted that these candidates didn?t enjoy the opportunity to be taught by highly qualified teachers. They were taught by the inmates in the prison who could mange with the English they knew,? he added.? ?
The courage, enthusiasm and passion that these inmates have displayed regarding their studies must be commended. They should be further encouraged to recover from the state they are in now and look forward to life. We can?t judge a person by his or her appearance. Intentions and attitudes direct individuals to where they should head.? ?

Diplomacy taking bizarre turn?
	
?
There are several countries keeping a coveted eye on our country for their own purposes. Two to three powerful Asian countries are among them. In fact, these Asian powers are in a race to strike deals with our country.?
?
Given the keen competition between these Asian powers to grab what they could from this country, some of these powers have resorted to certain unethical ways to hook certain purohitas handling key portfolios.?
For example, Colombo-based diplomats of some Asian powers have enticed the family members of some powerful purohitas for using them as conduits for influencing the latter, they say.?
Number One has already received reports from the national intelligence about several purohitas whose family members have been inveigled by diplomats. In fact, he has already reprimanded one or two senior purohitas in this connection, they say.?

A domineering couple very close to a leading powerful politician of a main political party has become a thorn in the side of the party?s local political activists, they say.

This couple does not allow the local politicos of the party even to organize a meeting without their knowledge and approval. ?This meddlesome couple throws monkey wrenches into every activity, every programme we organize on our own,? an irate party activist said.
This man and woman wielding the political clout ?delegated? to them by the leading politician monopolize the decision-making at every party conference or seminar held in the area, they say.?

ENCROACHMENT ISSUES continue over Kuragala archaeological reserve
	
?
The Archaeology Department?s failure to expel encroachers from the Kuragala archaeological site in the Mahawalatenna Plateau Balangoda over the past several years has raised concerns among environmentalists and archaeologists in the country.? ?
It is questionable as to why the Department of Archaeology is taking a lukewarm attitude towards the encroachers despite the court ruling delivered on April 20, 2012 by the Balangoda Magistrate directing the Department to eject the encroaches immediately.? ?
The ruins at Kuragala suggest that it was a predominant Buddhist monastery. The inscriptions on the roofs of the caves underscore the dedication with which the vast number of caves were used by Buddhist priests, according to Prof. Raj Somadeva?s Kalatota Survey- Phase 1 Journal.? ?
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Prof. Somadeva said when considering the proven historicity of the locations the legal provisions of the Antiquity Ordinance and later amendments should be implemented in order to manage the archaeological sites.? ?
?Kuragala has been identified as a focal point of human occupation since the terminal Pleistocene. There are several caves and the inscriptions therein had been written in the early form of the Brahmin characters. This shows that they belong around 250 Before the Common Era (BCE). The cluster of natural caves suggests that they had been occupied by Buddhist monks in the early phase of Buddhism in Sri Lanka,? Prof. Somadeva said.? ?Brahmin inscriptions
Encroachers, from the time they trespassed the site, have been destroying the artefacts. The Brahmin inscriptions that were unearthed in some rock caves are now being destroyed. In some places the concrete has obliterated the ancient inscriptions which dates back to the time before Arahath Mahinda?s arrival to the country.? ?
According to the survey carried out by Prof. Somadeva, Anusha Wanninayake and Dinesh Devage, the total archaeological landscape of Kuragala has been changed with the erection of a mosque in the terrace of Cave No: 1. Several burials of Islamic community in the archaeological site reveal how some encroachers have changed this place over the years for which the officials of the Department of Archaeology have to take responsibility.? ?
?Either side of the path to the main entrance that leads to the site has also been considerably modified by the construction of several permanent buildings. Cave No: 6 and 7 have been disfigured by the visitors to these sites,? the survey report states.? ?
This area was declared as an archaeological reserve on November 18, 1971 by the then Commissioner General of Archaeology Roland Silva. Former President R. Premadasa, in March 1990, had set aside 26 acres from the area to relocate encroachers. Although they obtained this land, the Presidential directive was not heeded.? ?Caves disfigured
?Ven. Kolonne Vijitha Thera requested from the Department of Archaeology through a letter dated November 16, 2004 seeking permission to erect a Buddha statue within the archaeological site to which permission wasn?t granted. However, to a reason known to them, the Archaeology Department allowed the encroachers to construct permanent structures within the reserve and didn?t take any action against disfiguring the caves,? Ven. Dayawansa Thero said.? ?
Meanwhile Dayawansa Thero further accused all the former Director Generals and the present Head of the Department of Archaeology for being biased. ?What is the reason they can?t act on the court directives? Under Antiquity Ordinance No: 9 of 1944, there are provisions for these officials to take stern action against the trespasses on any Reserve and also against those who have destroyed the artefacts therein,? the Thero claimed.? ?
Since the Archaeological officials had failed to eject the encroachers after the area was declared as an Archaeological Reserve in 1971 under gazette notification No: 14987, Ven. Kolonne Shantha Vijaya Thero had lodged a complaint with the Human Rights Commission in 2005 (HRC/ 6030/ 05) against the Commissioner General Archaeology, Head Quarters Inspector Balangoda, the Divisional Secretary Balangoda and Assistant Director Archaeology Sabaragamuva Province seeking instructions so that the Department can evict intruders.The Thera had also given evidence at the Presidential Commission representing the Buddha Sasana.??
Temporary buildings
?At the Human Rights investigation, the then Director General Archaeology confirmed with the Commission that the Department had not taken any steps to eject the people after the area had been declared a Reserve and also how they were allowed to construct temporary buildings. The Director General had also said that it is difficult to remove the buildings that had been constructed before the area was gazetted as an archaeological site,? Dayawansa Thero added.? ?
The? is in possession of both the order delivered by the Human Rights Commission on January 29, 2009 and the Magistrate Court order. The Commissioner General Archaeology was asked to produce the encroachers before court by the Human Rights Commission and not to allow the encroachers to destroy the Reserve. Meanwhile the court wanted the Department of Archaeology to expel the people from the site.? ?
Based on the HR Commission?s directives, the Legal Division of the Archaeology Department filed three cases in the Balangoda Magistrate Court against the intruders.? ?
The accused however informed the court that they had been living in the premises for over 70 years, and were unable to submit a legal document to prove ownership of the land other than the Grama Niladhari report and the electricity bills they possessed.? ?
Balangoda Magistrate G.A.R. Attygalle in her ruling delivered on April 20, 2012 ordered the Plaintiff to evacuate the defendent parties and their dependents. The appeal filed thereafter by the defendent was rejected twice.? ?
?Former Commissioner General Dr. Senarath Dissanayake should be held responsible for not taking any action to implement the court order. It was the former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa that intervened and got the Civil Defence Force to demolish sixteen illegal constructions and restored a few caves to its original standing,? sources from the Archaeology Department said on condition of anonymity.? ?
Department of Archaeology Director General Prof. P. Mandawela said that as per the court ruling all encroachers have been evicted other than the mosque which is in the vicinity of the caves.? ?
?I took over office recently and I?m not aware of the exact details of the illegal encroachment in this archaeological reserve. However when I inquired from one of our officials, I was told that there are no encroachers within the reserve now, but the mosque that was built few decades ago still stands there,? Prof. Mandawela said.? ?
Meanwhile Assistant Director Archaeology Tissa Madurapperuma said that plans are afoot to remove the mosque within the reserve.? ?
?We have allowed the Muslims to hold their annual festival in the mosque which is attended by thousands of devotees. But we have not allowed them to build temporary constructions. Although we have asked them to shift the mosque, within the reserve, they asked us to give them a few months to relocate it to which request the Department consented. However we are yet to clear the caves that have been coloured by encroachers and bring them back to their past glory,? Madurapperuma added.? ?
The Commissioner General of Archaeology has not responded so far.? ?

Fitch affirms Standard Chartered Sri Lanka branch at ?AAA(lka)?
	
Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed Standard Chartered Bank, Sri Lanka Branch?s (SCBSL) National Long-Term Rating at ?AAA(lka)?. The Outlook is Stable.
SCBSL?s rating reflects the credit profile and financial strength of Standard Chartered Bank.
The rating is linked with SCB?s IDR to reflect SCBSL?s legal status as a branch of SCB, which makes it part of the same legal entity. It also reflects the relatively small size of the branch (around 0.15 percent of the total assets of SCB at end-2016), and therefore any support would not be material to the? head office.
SCB?s rating is higher than Sri Lanka?s Long-Term Local- and Foreign-Currency IDRs of ?B+?/Stable?; and as a result, SCBSL?s rating is at the highest end of the National Rating scale for Sri Lanka. Fitch believes that support from SCB would be forthcoming if required, subject to any regulatory constraints on remitting money into Sri Lanka. SCBSL?s reported non-performing loan ratio continues to remain low compared to local peers despite the increase in the ratio to 0.8 percent at end-June 2017 from 0.3 percent at end-2015.
Fitch expects the branch to maintain sufficient capitalisation to support its business plans despite regular profit repatriations. SCBSL?s Fitch Core Capital ratio improved to 21.0 percent at end June 2017 from 19.9 percent at end-2016 supported by internal capital generation.

Garbage menace reaches forest reserves
	
The lives of elephants who feed at the Digampathana forest reserve in Dambulla were in danger due to the large amounts of garbage that has been dumped at a site in the reserve. Residents in the area complained that a herd of 25- 30 wild elephants including a tusker fed on garbage and often terrorized villagers for more food and often destroyed cultivated land.
Many complained that the vast area had now turned into a dumping site and that despite numerous complaints and appeals to the authorities, who often traveled overseas on public funds, no solution had been given. Pix by Kanchana Kumara Ariyadasa?

Govt.'s decision on SAITM a fraud - MFSAC convener
	
While rejecting the direction issued by the Vice Chancellors of State Universities for all medical students to engage in their academic work with immediate effect, the Medical Faculty Students' Action Committee (MFSAC) today said that the university students belonging to eight medical faculties have decided to continue boycotting lectures in protest of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine despite the latest stand taken by the government regarding it.
MFSAC Convener Ryan Jayalath told the Daily Mirror that the government?s decision to abolish the SAITM and convert it into a not for profit institution coming under the University Grants Commission (UGC) was a fraud done by the government to cheat on the people.
?Through this decision, the ownership of the SAITM will be the only thing that would change. The ownership of it will be handed over to some other party. But the deceitful procedure of the SAITM will be continuing even in the future. The main issue here is the privatization of free education,? he added.
He said that no solution had been granted for the issues which had been created through the privatization of free education, by this decision. He also said that the main reason behind the government?s attempt to change the name of the SAITM was that it had already been rejected from the medical councils in Britain, Australia and Maldives.
He said that university students attached to all medical faculties in the country would continue boycotting lectures uninterruptedly for the tenth month.
However, the Committee of Vice Chancellors and Directors (CVCD) said in a statement that this series of proposals could be accepted as a positive and constructive series of proposals for the purpose of solving the issue arisen on the Medical Faculty of SAITM.
?Accordingly, since a positive situation has been created for all medical students of state universities to continue their education and clinical training, we, the Vice Chancellors, insist them to engage in their academic work with immediate effect,? it said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Government has failed to allocate sufficient funds for the development of the Western province.
The purohita in charge of the subject made this charge at a recent meeting at the top table.?
?
Speaking in a voice charged with emotion, the purohita also faulted those responsible for pruning funds set apart for development projects in the Western province for transference to the Central province projects.
?When we should lose no time in addressing the pressing city shanty problem, you are transferring funds allocated to us for housing projects in other areas,? he alleged.?
The purohita also said that it was a matter for shame that the people in the Western province who gave a massive vote to both Number One and Number Two in yahapalanaya at the national polls in the recent past had been forgotten so soon.?
Sounding a note of warning, he added: ?If you continue to neglect the people who gave you a massive support, they will surely punish you come the 2020 general polls!?

He is set for the comeback
	
?
A Green politico recently suffered a heavy fall from power which those close to him attributed to the malefic influence of Saturn. Now they claim that Saturn has turned benefic following its recent ingress into a new sign and the man is about to get back his high office and other status he lost.
?
Those peddling this story also say that the politico will get back the prestigious finance subject as well.?
Meanwhile, a Buddhist monk residing in a temple in the outskirts of the city, a frequent visitor to a well-known party head office in Pitakotte area has reportedly told a group of Diyawanna members that no power on earth could take away what a benefic Saturn would bestow on one.?
Nevertheless, the politico continues to make offerings and conduct Poojas to propitiate the deities, they say.
The man is said to be firm in his belief that the time is not far away when he could begin shining as brightly as he did before. However, not even a faint sign of a green light to come from the palace is in sight so far, they say.

His arrival required a departure
	
?
The former strongman the other day accompanied by security personnel as usual called at a well-known temple in the city to pay his last respects to a Buddhist prelate.
?
After paying his last respects to the prelate, the former boss greeted a large group of VIPs and members of Maha Sangha present on the occasion and later got engrossed in a lengthy discourse with them on several topical national issues including the new Constitution in the making.
While this discourse was proceeding, another security detail was seen entering the temple premises. One member of the just-arrived detail approached the former strongman?s security personnel and inquired from them when their Lokka was expected to leave the temple premises. The former strongman?s security men replied that they did not know. The newcomers left the place and returned after about half an hour and made the same inquiry. Having realized the significance of why they wanted to know the time of their boss? time of departure, the security chief headed where the former strongman was engaged in an animated discussion with a group of mourners and quietly informed him of the new development.
The former strongman chuckled and said: ?Ah! Is that so? Then let us go now!?
Soon after the former strongman?s departure, a motorcade escorting a very important person entered the temple premises.

Ladies? College launches Smart Interactive Board
	
Over the years, we have seen technological development in a variety of fields be it aviation, banking, or communication. But is this development reflected in classroom activity? When it comes to education, technological development remains stagnated. Ladies? College Colombo takes the first step forward with the launch of the SMART Interactive Board on October 16.?
The SMART Interactive Board is a 64-inch television look-alike screen but has a computer installed in it. With a ten-point touch enabled into it, the board allows students and teachers to interact with the board and with each other.?
?SMART boards utilise active learning, where our students are stimulated and engaged kinaesthetically, visually and through auditory channels, taking them to an even higher levels of understanding,? said Ladies? College Principal, Eesha Speldewinde.?
She says it encourages a fun and creative atmosphere, where Mathematics can be taught using sports. For instance, a student could mentally calculate the answer to a question and then shoot a basketball into the hoop with the corresponding answer. Or in English, where an interactive toolkit could be used to correctly punctuate a piece of prose or burst the hot air balloons that do not contain a suitable example of an adverb. ?Not only does this reinforce the methodology taught in the lesson, but it also reaches out and seizes the attention of our students, even with the most withdrawn ones, creating them lifelong learners,? said Speldewinde.?
The product was introduced by Nimal Peiris, COO, E.W. Information Systems Ltd., while a demonstration was done by Suresh Samarasinghe, Assistant Manager
She further said it was truly a dream come true to be able to have a SMART board installed in each classroom. ?I look forward to watching our students gaining a plethora of advanced technological skills as their lessons are brought to life, ensuring they are well prepared to take our technologically-driven world; and I do know that they will embrace these wonderful devices with much enthusiasm,? She said.?
Preethi Adhihetty, President of the Old Girls? Association, expressed her joy to be able to be a part of this initiative of her alma mater. ?At Ladies? College, we believe education is not just the accumulation of knowledge by rote in the classroom, but a lifelong and holistic process. Through the provision of these cutting-edge technological facilities, we hope to empower our students by creating opportunities to expand their horizons, connect with each other and the world and to hone practical skills that will be invaluable far beyond the classroom horizons,? she said.?
The product was introduced by Nimal Peiris, COO, E.W. Information Systems Ltd., while a demonstration was done by Suresh Samarasinghe, Assistant Manager.?
Volunteers from the audience were allowed to try out some of the software installed in the board. Software such as Smart Notebook, which displayed a board very much like a magiboard with different types of pens, rulers and erasers, were demonstrated. Software in which one could look at the parts of a leaf, a dissected fish or the human anatomy, three-dimensionally, were also displayed.?

Learn a lesson from Spain-Catalonia crisis: PHU
	
The Sri Lankan government should learn a lesson from the incident where the Catalan Region declared independence from Spain, a country which is considered ?Indivisible? by its Constitution, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) said today.
PHU Leader MP Udaya Gammanpila said only because a Constitution says a country is ?undividable or indivisible? doesn?t mean a country could not be divided in reality.
?The government continues to say that it will include the term ?undividable or indivisible? in a new Constitution as a measure against separatism. Spain, which is an indivisible state, had proven this measure is a futile attempt today. By the Spanish Constitution of 1978, states were given maximum powers. What was the result? Catalans declared independence. Basque region is also on the verge of declaring independence,? he told a news briefing.
He said the Spanish Constitution had shown that no clause could prevent regions breaking away from a country when those regions were given maximum powers to act independently.
He said interim report of the Steering Committee proposed to devolve power through the ?Subsidiary Principle?.
?This means peripheries should be vested with ample powers to act on their own. In such a situation, the central government will only have the power to manage financial, defence and foreign affairs of the country,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

MFSPA to resort to 'fast unto death' protest
	
While rejecting the latest stand taken by the government regarding the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), the Medical Faculty Students? Parents? Association (MFSPA) today warned that it would resort to a fast unto death protest on Monday (6), if the related authorities would not provide them with an actual solution to this issue.
The government announced on Sunday that it had decided to abolish the SAITM and convert it into a not for profit institution coming under the University Grants Commission (UGC).
MFSPA Media Spokesman Dr. Nimal Karunasiri told Daily Mirror that they could not stand in line with the stance of the government because the said decision had not been announced by an eligible official.
?This decision was announced through the Director General of the Government Information Department. We cannot stop our battle just on an announcement by him. What if the government in future would say that they would not be held responsible for this statement? Therefore, we will continue our battle against the SAITM without any interruption as earlier,? he added.
He said that this decision could also be regarded as a tricky step taken by the government to nullify the strength of the parents? summit organized by the state university students? parents on Sunday.
He also said that over 250 parents had given their consent to take part in the fast unto death protest which was scheduled to start on Monday. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

New York attack: Eight killed by man driving truck
	
At least eight people have been killed and 11 seriously hurt in New York after the driver of a truck mowed down people on a cycle path in Lower Manhattan.
A 29-year-old man who emerged from the white pick-up truck was shot by a police officer and arrested. Officials later said it was a terror attack.
Media named him as Sayfullo Saipov, an immigrant who came to the US in 2010.
A note was found in the truck that referred to so-called Islamic State, a law enforcement source.
The suspect - who had apparently settled in Florida - was taken to hospital.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said it was "cowardly act of terror aimed at innocent civilians".
He added: "We know that this action was intended to break our spirit. But we also know that New Yorkers are strong, New Yorkers are resilient and our spirit will never be moved by an act of violence and an act meant to intimidate us."
New York Police Department (NYPD) Commissioner James O'Neill said the injured had "serious but non-life threatening injuries".
"The dead and injured were just going about their days, heading home from work or from school or enjoying the afternoon sun on their bicycles," the commissioner said.
"This is a tragedy of the greatest magnitude for many people, for many families here in New York and beyond today."
Mangled bicycles littered the scene of the attack, which occurred as much of the city was celebrating Halloween.
One witness, identified as Eugene, told ABC Channel 7 that he saw the white pick-up truck driving fast down the cycle path alongside the West Side Highway, near Stuyvesant High School, at full speed and hitting a number of people.
He also reported hearing about nine or 10 shots.
Another witness, who gave his name as Frank, told local TV network NY1 that he had seen a man running around an intersection and heard five to six gunshots.
"I saw he had something in his hand, but I couldn't tell what it was. But they said that it was a gun...
"When the cops shot him, everybody started running away and it got a little bit crazy right there. So when I tried to look again, the guy was already down." (BBC)

Addressing the media in the Parliament premises, Minister Ramanayake said he was asked to be removed from his former organiser post following several petitions received by the party which had claimed that he was struggling against several under world groups.
?Then I inquired from the UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim about said petitions against me,? he added.
Earlier, he was the UNP Organiser for Divulapitiya and was recently replaced by Kithsiri Manchanayake.
Mr. Hashim told the media that false rumours had been carried by the media saying that Minister Ramanayaka was expelled from the party.
While rejecting those claims he said that Ramanayake was a valuable person to the party.
?Therefore, we decided to appoint him as the District Organiser not only for the Gampaha District but to cover up the whole country. Following a request of him we decided to appoint Kithsiri Manchanayake as the Divulapitiya organiser,? he added. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Sampath Sanhinda Saver rewards senior citizens with over Rs.100 mn in medical benefits
	
In line with its commitment to caring for its customers and adding greater value to their lives, Sampath Bank announced that is distributing over Rs.100 million in medical benefits to Sampath Sanhinda Saver account holders.
This is the highest value of medical benefits being awarded in a given year by Sampath Bank under the Sanhinda Saver account. The bank has been awarding such benefits to Sanhinda Saver account holders based on their annual average account balance for nine consecutive years, from 2009. They are just one of the many privileges offered by?the account.
Sampath Bank has designed the Sanhinda Saver account from the ground up to specifically meet the needs of its esteemed customers who are over the age of 55. Account holders receive a higher rate of interest, with interest payments being made twice a month. Additional interest is paid for foreign currency (US$) savings accounts. The bank also offers them a host of deals and discounts at several leading hospitals, pharmacies, medical labs and other merchant partners.
Sampath Bank PLC Deposit Mobilization Assistant General Manager Sanath Abhayaratne said: ?At Sampath Bank, we take great pride in being a truly Sri Lankan financial service provider. We have always strived to live by the nation?s values and belief systems and incorporate them in everything we do. Inspired by our society?s regards for elders and the tradition of caring for them when they get older, the Sampath Sanhinda Saver account is tailored to meet the unique needs of customers over the age of 50. It offers account holders a host of benefits and privileges that are aligned to their lifestyle. Thanking them for placing their trust in Sampath Bank, we are delighted to offer over Rs.100 million in medical benefits this year, the highest ever in our history.?
Sampath Bank has also launched the Sanhinda Medical Benefit Card to enable Sanhinda Saver account holders avail their rewards and benefits with greater ease. Coming in place of the Sanhinda vouchers currently in use, the cards bring in greater convenience and security. Unlike the vouchers, account holders will now be able to pay out only the specific amount they need from the total value of benefits available in their card using the new Sanhinda Medical Benefit Card. While the cards will be valid for five years from the date of issue, the benefits being distributed currently are valid until 28th February 2018.

The Blue party members of the JO met the other day to take a decision on a collective stand they should take when they attend the special meeting with Number One scheduled for a day in the first week of next month.
?
Some of the members openly wondered whether there would be any purpose in attending a meeting with Number One. However, some others argued there was no harm in meeting the big man when summoned.?
Arguments for and against attending the meeting were being bandied about when one of them came up with a brain wave. ?Let us first ask Number One whether he was summoning us as the head of the party or as the head of the government.??
?Yes, yes. Go on!? the others urged him to go ahead with the proposition.
?If he says that he is summoning the meeting as the head of the government, we can say that we do not wish to have anything to do with the Greens in the government! If he says that he is calling us as the head of the party, let us tell him, ?Speak to us after ending the union with the Greens!?.? And they all hailed this idea.
They also decided to keep mum about their decision until they receive a formal invitation.?

Seven Palestinian militants killed as Israel blows up tunnel from Gaza
	
?
By Loveday Morris ? (c) 2017, The Washington Post ? Oct 31, 2017 -? ?
?JERUSALEM - Israel?s military said Monday that it destroyed an attack tunnel that led into its territory from the Gaza Strip, killing at least seven Palestinian militants, including a senior commander of the Islamic Jihad group and two members of Hamas.? ?
The tunnel crossed from the area of Khan Younis in Gaza and was still under construction, according to Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a spokesman for the Israeli military.? ?
Islamic Jihad, the second-largest armed faction in Gaza after Hamas, said five of its members were killed, including the commander of its military wing in central Gaza. The group described the destruction of the tunnel as a ?dangerous escalation? and said it reserved the right to respond to the ?terrorist aggression.?? ?
Hamas said two of its militants were killed during a rescue mission after the tunnel was targeted. Israel has been working on new technology to detect and destroy tunnels since its 2014 war with Hamas, when the group used underground warrens to launch attacks and defend themselves from airstrikes.?
A total of 67 Israeli soldiers and six Israeli civilians were killed in the conflict, while 2,251 Palestinians died, according to the United Nations.??
Israel also is constructing an underground barrier to prevent tunnels from crossing into Israel. The Palestinian enclave is already fenced off above ground.? ?
?I told you many times before that we are developing breakthrough technology to deal with the tunnel threat,? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told local media on Friday. ?We are implementing it. Today, we located a tunnel, and we destroyed it.???
Conricus declined to give further information on the ?new technology? but said it was used for the first time in detecting a tunnel. The tunnel ended just over a mile from the Israeli village of Kissufum, which he said was the assumed target.??
?We have no interest in an escalation,? he said, but he added that Hamas, which has controlled Gaza since 2007, would be held responsible for any aggressive action from the area.? ?
Hamas, which is in the process of reconciling with its rival Palestinian faction, Fatah, accused Israel of attempting to sow discord and ?ruin efforts to restore Palestinian unity.?? ?

Residents of the coastal strip south of the Bangladesh port of Cox?s Bazar fished 37 survivors out of the water and 11 have been admitted to hospital in a critical condition, said police officer Mohammad Abul Khair of the area?s Ukhiya police station.??
The boat had keeled over in choppy seas as rain fell. According to survivors they had paid 50,000 kyat ($37) to be taken to Bangladesh, having abandoned their homes in Buthidaung, in the strife-torn north of Myanmar?s Rakhine State.??

A politico, now an inmate of a state-run lodge had been fortunate enough to enjoy the comforts and facilities of the hospital attached to the lodge from the day one of his term and an order had come from above recently that he be sent back to a cell in the lodge.

This lodger was admitted to the hospital following a complaint made by him that he was experiencing difficulty in breathing, a condition he had suddenly developed after the sentence imposed by the court.?
The medical advice that a power point in the cell assigned to him be installed first to enable the use of some electronic medical appliances prevented the immediate transfer of the man back to the lodge.
A power point was soon installed in the cell meant for the politico-lodger. But he continues his stay in the hospital, they say.?
By the way, there are more than 10 lodgers staying in the hospital despite requiring no specialized indoor treatment while some really sick lodgers who deserve hospitalization undergo suffering in the cells, informed sources say.??

Not satisfied with the first scan, they got him to step into the machine for a repeat check. The gentleman looked embarrassed, but readily submitted himself to this fussy body check.
The media personnel who later made inquiries as to why a no lesser person than a party leader and the Opposition leader of Diyawanna council to boot was subjected to such a humiliating situation had been told that the security detail at the gate did not identify the VIP.?

If cricket in Sri Lanka was not pulled out of the rut it is in now, it would be impossible to win the World Cup in 2019, former test captain and Minister of Petroleum Resources Development Arjuna Ranatunga said.
Speaking to a group of journalists, the former skipper complained that the issue was not the players but the management of the sport who made decisions on popularity. ?I am not worried about the players, they are talented. However, the people in the management are not those who can manage the team properly,? he said.
Reminding those present that his predictions about the sport in the country had never been wrong, the Minister said that it would be difficult to win the next World Cup held in the unfamiliar and rather difficult play turf of England.
?The players need to be mentally prepared to play for the country. I have informed the highest authorities of the country of this situation but I am yet to receive a favourable reply, if they do nothing this will be the government that watched cricket die,? he said.

Will they succeed this time round?
	
?
Yet another serious bid to solder together the JO and the pro-Compassionate One faction is being made behind the scenes these days, they say.
?
A group including John the Silent, Boralugoda scion and the former Betel leaf secretarial one held council inside an inner chamber of a Ministry for several hours to work out an unerring plan this time round, they say.?
A pro-Maitri one from Rajarata and an ambitious one from the deep South came in for their severe flak, who, they agreed, were the villains of the piece. They also blamed the gabby JO one from szGampaha for throwing spanners into the works from time to time.?
The plan drawn up by the group to save the Blue party is expected to be announced shortly, they say.?
