Preserve your life by minimising food preservatives
	

By A.L.S.SewwandiAre you addicted to or have you ever tasted readymade market food which have a new taste, appearance or odor These foods have received these characteristic due to the adding of chemical substances with the view of preserving the food. These chemicals enhance the organoleptic properties (colour, flavour, this appearance and texture) in food. This kind of chemicals are categorized as food additives.
Food manufacturers use food additives to increase profits through prolonged product shelf life and create a huge demand which they do by making the food pleasant in appearance, smell and flavour. But in the past, people have prepared their own food through the produce grown in their own home garden. Records show that they have also used ingredients like spices and salt with the aim of preserving food. Food also has been soaked in honey and salting when making pickles and smoked items. The islanders have been using traditional food preservation techniques. They have used natural preservatives for this purposes. But with the passing of time, peoples lifestyles and food habits have changed as a result of urbanization, globalization and developments in the food sector. These developments have continuously created new chemicals which have been used to manipulate, preserve and transform our food. Adding of food additives offers numerous advantages to food manufactures as well as consumers. However, these chemically synthesized ingredients negatively effect human health in the case of over consumption. 

Food additives
According to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA, 1993) a food additive is defined as any substance which results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, in its becoming a component or otherwise affecting the characteristics
of any food. 
The main types of food additives
Preservatives, flavoring agents, coloring agent, nutritional additives, texturizing agents and miscellaneous additives can be identified as the main types of food additives. 
Advantages of food additives
1. Improve or maintain nutritional value - Vitamins and minerals are added to restore nutrition values lost in the processing or storage. 
2. Maintain palatability - Antioxidants are used to prevent rancidity or development of an off flavor in fats and oils of baked goods and other foods. 
3. Preserve food by preventing microbial food spoilage. 
4. Maintain product consistency- Emulsifiers give products a consistent texture and prevent them from separating. 
5. Enhance flavour and appearance - Synthetic flavors enhances the taste of food while colours help to enhance appearance. 
6. Control acidity and alkalinity in order to modify the acidity and alkalinity of foods for proper flavor, taste and color. 
7. Maintain the product quality.
Negative effect of food additives
Such manipulation of our food can have an excessive effect on our bodys unique biochemical balance. Food additives may badly effect our health due to over consumption and their accumulation through frequent usage. Their effects may be immediate or long-term. Immediate effects may include headaches, change in energy level, alterations in mental concentration, behaviour or immune response. The long-term effects may include the increased risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease and other adverse health conditions like; cancer, asthma, cardiovascular disease, severe headaches, allergies, respiratory problems, increase in hyperactivity, skin rashes, kidney and liver dysfunction, hormonal imbalances, reproductive disorders, birth defects and premature births and the suppression of the immune system.
The vulnerable groups are young children, small children, pregnant women and persons with
metabolic disorders.

Latest research
Recent researches indicate that nitrates and nitrites present in processed meat increase the risk of colon and pancreatic cancers. And also some studies discovered some incidents of breast and pancreatic cancers due to the consumption of coke like beverages which contain food additives.
Possible causes for the development of carcinogenicity in food additives are changes in chemical structure of additives during processing (nitrates and nitrites convert into nitrosamines in meat products), improper and longer storage conditions, exceeding the safe dosage of additives and getting in contact with other carcinogenics.
Studies have proven that emulsifiers can alter the gut microbiota composition and induce intestinal inflammation that promotes the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a group of very common obesity-related disorders that can lead to type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular and liver diseases. 
A specific study showed that tartrazine and benzoates induce abnormal behaviour patterns in 79% of study child population. Tartrazine is mainly used as a colouring agent in the soft drink industry. According to few rat studies, sunset yellow has a carcinogenic effect while erythrosine leads hyperactivity.

## Title: Rare longest lunar eclipse tonight

Rare longest lunar eclipse tonight
	
Sri Lankans would have a rare opportunity to observe the longest total lunar eclipse in the 21st century tonight and the early hours on tomorrow.
The Colombo University Astronomy and Space Science Unit Director Prof. Chandana Jayaratna said the total duration of the eclipse is 6 hours and 14 minutes.
The eclipse begins at 10.44 pm, Sri Lanka Standard Time on July 27 when the moon enters into the penumbra - the less dark shadow of the earth and will end up at 4.58 am on July 28.
Prof. Jayaratna said that Sri Lankan would not have the opportunity to see another total lunar eclipse from beginning to the end again till 2025.
On this day, the earth will pass between the sun and the moon and therefore the moon will disappear into the Earth's darkest shadow, known as the umbra. For one hour and 43 minutes, the moon will disappear from the sky, entirely obscured by the shadow that our planet casts upon it. Given the moon is currently the furthest away in its orbit, it will take longer to pass through the shadow causing the eclipse to be the longest in 100 years, he said in a statement.
It is also expected to be the longest blood moon witnessed in 100 years. The Moon will be visible in a scarlet red hue for over 1 hour and 43 minutes, which is 40 per cent longer than any other blood moon measured in recent times.
For the naked eye observers, the eclipse will start to see from 11.54 pm when the moon begins to enter into the penumbra-the dark shadow of the Earth.
The total eclipse begins at 1.00 am on tomorrow morning, the greatest eclipse occurs at 1.51 am, total part of the eclipse ends up at 2.43 am and partial eclipse ends up at 3.49 am tomorrow.
After that the moon will enter into the less dark shadow of the Earth, the penumbra and only the dimming of the Moonlight will occur till eclipse ends at 4.58 am with the moon leaving the penumbral part of the eclipse. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Rise and fall of human race
	
Even Mara (death) is indefensible against the power of Arahanthood
A Sakvithi dawns on a world ready to bloom
In desperation the king resorted to the ultimate recourse of beheading those found guilty
With the country caught up in this vicious cycle, life spans of men began to diminish drastically
The ten courses of evil conduct and debasement will substitute for goodness and merit in the world

Sakvithi, also called Chakravarthi, is no mythical figure, but an extraordinary monarch with superhuman powers who makes his rare appearance when a Buddhas dispensation is non-existent on earth. The strength of merit in him makes his reign cover the four quarters of the world without resorting to the use of weapons and other destructive dispositions, - thus laying claim to the title Wheel Turning Monarch a non - sobriquet. The thirty two great features that distinguish a Samma Sambuddha are common to him as well, save the colour and direction of the urna roma  positioned on his forehead. Possession of ten meritorious qualities in their extremity, has bestowed upon him a splurge of thaumaturgical capabilities including astral travel that defy all known logic and earthly parametres. 
A king takes to robes
A Sakvithi dawns on a world ready to bloom. Gauthma Buddha had occasion to deliver a sermon later titled Chakravarthi Seehanada centred on such an entity who shone upon the human plane countless eons ago. The righteous monarch, ruler of the earth, was called Dalhanemi. 
Having secured his realm he was in possession of seven incomparable treasures, first of which was a sacred wheel of gold. He had a thousand sons of heroic stature. Having ruled the earth without stick or sword for thousands upon thousands of years, he instructed a courtier of his to inform him immediately if he observed the slightest movement of the wheel treasure from its original resting position. Many centuries later the courtier reported to the great monarch that the sacred wheel had drifted by a fraction, whereupon the king summoned his eldest son to announce he will not live much longer and that the time for him to dwell on heavenly pleasures had arrived. Take over my reign of the ocean- bounded land. I will renounce lay life and enter robes he said. 
Seven days after the royal sage departed the scared wheel treasure vanished. The king in robes addressed his son again Son, do not despair over the wheels disappearance, it is no family heirloom. When you perform the duties of an Aryan Wheel Turner the sacred wheel will reappear. What are those duties Holding aloft the Dhamma as your banner and your emblem, you should honour it, cherish it, and venerate it along with the royal household. The second duty of yours is to ensure your troops comply with the laws of Dhamma, and the third the nobles and vassals under your rule, followed by the Brahmins. Fifthly, your duty extends to the town and country folks. Protection of the ascetics and Brahmins of the kingdom is your sixth task. It is followed by the duty to protect all the lands birds and beasts. Equally important is to ensure no criminal activities prevail under your guard. The distribution of wealth among the poor and the destitute is the ninth sacred duty. Finally, when those ascetics and Brahmins in your kingdom, who have renounced the life of sensual infatuation, are marked by their compassion and gentleness, each one in control of himself and in quietude, each one striving for the end of craving, it is your bounden duty to approach them with respect and seek their guidance as to what is wholesome and unwholesome, blameworthy and blameless, what is to be adhered to and what is to be discarded and what action in the long term will lead to harm and sorrow and what to welfare and happiness. Those, my son, are the duties of an Aryan Chakravarthi. 
When the anointed crown prince lived faithfully according to his fathers counsel the sacred wheel treasure appeared before him as foretold. Directed by the sacred wheel the Sakvithi King with his four-fold army succeeded in receiving the allegiance of all the kingdoms in the four directions of the earth from sea to sea without having to resort to force. He continued to guide the worlds inhabitants on the moral precepts of right livelihood. Consequent to his demise six others of the royal lineage went on to rule the entire world in peace as did the ones before them. 
Thievery, robbery and beheading
The seventh successor monarch however failed to donate funds to the poor and the destitute though he performed other rituals. In consequence poverty became widespread followed by theft and robbery. Brought before the king, the accused were pardoned and given wealth on account of their penury. The practice of pardoning of offences and donating of funds continued till it became common knowledge among the populace and in no time the peoples major vocation became thievery and robbery. In desperation the king resorted to the ultimate recourse of beheading those found guilty, which inevitably led to armed citizens revolting against the cruel king. 
With the country caught up in this vicious cycle, life spans of men began to diminish drastically. It dropped from eighty thousand years to forty thousand and twenty thousand until it reached two hundred and fifty. By then devious degenerative deeds such as taking of life, uttering of falsehoods, adultery, evil talk, insurmountable desires within themselves, anger, lust, gross avarice, homosexuality, incestual desires towards parents and close relatives, wild utterance became common place. Inevitably the human life span declined to a hundred years and finally to ten. When it reaches that stage all likeable flavours of humans turn bitter. The epicurean food of the day was kudrusa grain. The ten courses of moral conduct would disappear. The ten courses of evil conduct and debasement will substitute for goodness and merit in the world. The word moral will take leave of their vocabulary. Girls become marriageable at five years. Those who have no respect for mother, father and elders will be the ones who enjoy honour and prestige in society. Parents and children will not recognize each other, neither will the immediate relatives, like goats and sheep, cockerels and pigs, dogs and jackals. Fierce hatred and violent thoughts overcome them, children against parents, brothers against sisters and vice versa in the manner of hunters that stalk beasts. Then arrives what is known as the weapons spell of seven days, when weapons appear in their hands and mistaking each other for wild animals, annihilate themselves en masse. Where in this spectrum of rise and decline does this advanced world in the 21st century stand today, one may rightfully ask
After a period of time some of those who escape the carnage having retreated to thickets and mountains begin to realize their past wrongs, rehabilitate themselves and are overcome by compassion for their brethren
Jambudeepa
After a period of time some of those who escape the carnage having retreated to thickets and mountains begin to realize their past wrongs, rehabilitate themselves and are overcome by compassion for their brethren. With their newly turned lives of peace, harmony and goodwill, the lifespan begins to improve and their appearance become pleasant. Generation by generation their longevity would increase until it reaches eighty thousand years as before. The marriageable age of girls will be five hundred years. Only three diseases will be known to man; greed, fasting and old age. Jambudeepa then will be a mighty prosperous nation with Kethumathi the present Varanasi as its capital with eighty thousand sub cities. 
Among the people with an eighty thousand year life-span, there will arise again a righteous monarch of the law named Sankha, a wheel-turner and conqueror of the four quarters. Later in that era there will also arise a Blessed Lord by the name of Metteyya, supreme teacher of the universe with its Devas and Maras, Brahmas, ascetics, Brahimins, its kings and inhabitants. He will proclaim Dhamma that is fine in the beginning, fine in the middle and fine in the end, perfect in spirit and the letter.
In time, the wheel turner Sankha, will gift his palace to the ascetics. The helpless and the destitute will shave off his hair. He will then don the saffron robe and embark on the blameless, unerring journey under Samma Sambuddha Metteyya in solitude, steadfast in resolution and determination. He will reach in that very life itself the final post of the holy life, in the sake of which young men of good upbringing go forth having abandoned the householders life of superficial comfort and ease. 
The Blessed One concluded the sermon in these terms, Monks, be an island unto your selves a refuge unto yourselves with none other as your refuge. Let Dhamma be that island and that refuge. Monks, confine yourselves to your own preserves the ancestral haunts of your teacher wherein you will gain in beauty, happiness, wealth and power. 
What is the length of a monks life It is the four concentrations of effort, energy, consciousness, and investigation. 
What is the beauty for a monk It is the practice of right conduct, restraint in accordance with his discipline, perfection of behaviour and habits, consciousness in the slightest of faults and abiding by the rules of his training. 
What is a monks happiness It is the attainment of four jhanas upon detachment from sense to desires. 
What is wealth of a monk Here the monk dwells suffusing the four quarters of the world with unbounded loving kindness free of hatred and ill-will. He dwells suffusing the entire world with compassion, with sympathetic joy and with equanimity filled in his heart 
What is the power of a monk It is that state of total liberation he experiences with his own supra-knowledge in this very life itself. 
Monks, said He in conclusion, The one single invincible power in the world is that of Mara. He too is indefensible against the power of Arahanthood 
The monks rejoiced over these words of the Master.

Tech-Hub land crisis: Railways demand land to build Control Centre
	
Railway Trade Unions yesterday conducted a two-hour long unannounced strike affecting rail services after they were not allowed to erect a fence dividing a plot of land from the Trace Expert City premises, to construct a nine-storey building for a railway control centre.
The officials of the Railways Department had planned to erect a fence around the land area which was located near the Elphinstone Theatre, Maradana.
While the Railway officers were at the land, State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs Harsha De Silva arrived at the location.
The State Minister who arrived at the location under the orders of the President and the Prime Minister threatened us to stop erecting the fence. He said the land area belonged to the ministry for vehicle parking purposes. Even the people near the buildings had blamed the Railway officials claiming the land area was reserved to park their vehicles, the Railway Management, Executive, Operative Unions said.
They said President Maithripala Sirisena earlier had assured that the land, which was previously held by the Urban Development Authority, should stay with the Railways Department and that if it was given to the private sector the revenue should be divided equally.

The Cult of Personality
	
The Buddha never asked and encouraged anyone to perform any rites and rituals in the name of the Buddha or his profound teaching
The quality and standard of the monkhood has been drastically changed

There are four major religions in the globe today. Those who wholeheartedly follow them do accept and believe what they follow. Multitudes of rites and rituals are contained in each of them. Worthy and meaningful practices are always impressive and appreciated.
What the Buddha expounded and taught for the humanity is now called Buddhism but the Blessed One introduced it as Dhamma Vinaya  Doctrine and Discipline.Though some people make an effort to pronounce and present teachings of the Buddha as same as other faiths, what the Buddha proclaimed was completely different from other religious teachings. The Buddhas teaching is completely based on the mind.
The Buddha never asked and encouraged anyone to perform any rites and rituals in the name of the Buddha or his profound teaching. Somehow, so called born Buddhists blindly perform and unwisely pursue some rites and rituals even in foreign countries.
Some activities might help them to improve and develop spiritual inner faculties such as interest (Saddha). I personally say that it is better than nothing.
First and foremost we all must thoroughly and comprehensively learn about our teacher the Buddha and his profound teaching. As an aspirant or seeker of Perfect Enlightenment, Bodhisatva, he has shown and pragmatically introduced the paramount factors which indefatigably practise to accomplish his ultimate spiritual aspiration- Buddhahood.
Ten paramis or ten perfections are the driving forces which unprecedentedly transformed an ordinary human being into an extraordinary human being (Achchariya manussa). Ambition, generosity, aspiration, moral conduct, effort, determination, dedication, compassion, renunciation, loving-kindness, patience, tolerance, endurance, forbearance, truthfulness, equanimity and wisdom are the paramount and sublime factors at which Bodhisatva perfectly excelled.
Simplicity is the utmost impressive characteristic which I personally encountered in the biography of the Blessed One.
Unfortunately, the deplorable and distressing fact is that individual branded credos and dogmas are proliferated and multiplied in the name of the Buddha Dhamma
After completion of his first group of enlightened disciples, launching his Dhamma mission the Buddha advised them to set off to teach the Dhamma for the benefit and welfare of humanity, for their happiness, peace and meaningful life. They taught the Dhamma Vinaya- doctrine and discipline.
By practising generosity, morality and meditation, not only were people reformed and re-organized but the surroundings and vicinities were changed into liveable and sustainable environments.
Respect, love, compassion, sharing, politeness, truthfulness and many other wholesome practical qualities were implanted and encouraging them to lead meaningful and wholesome lives. The Blessed One and his enlightened disciples compassionately inspired and encouraged people to lead their lives with wholesome inner qualities. Our great Master the Blessed One always highlighted unity, harmony, inner peace, innermost happiness and many more spiritual factors in his teachings, and encouraged his disciples to promote them among others.
Specially by seeing proclivities and propensities of their previous lives, the Buddha encouraged numerous individuals to cultivate and develop their inner faculties to achieve their spiritual aspirations.
Untrained and uneducated preachers are abundant in Sri Lanka in the name of the dispensation of the Buddha in this new millennium. Lack of proper training and knowledge of the Dhamma led them to express their own views and ideas in the name of the Buddha Dhamma
My personal experience with many scholars and most venerable Buddhist monks are memorable and still resounding in my mind though some of them are departed from us. 
Late Venerable Balangoda Ananda Meithreeya Maha Nayaka Maha Thero, late Venerable Narada Maha Thero, late Most Venerable Madihe Pannaseeha Maha Nayaka Maha Thero, late Venerable Piyadassi Maha Thero, late Venerable Nauyane Ariyadhamma Maha Thero, late Venerable Panadure Ariyadhamma Maha Thero and lateVenerable Welimitiyawe Dhammarakkhita Maha Thero were the prominent personages who profoundly performed their duties and discharged their responsibilities as leaders of the community of Maha Sangha in recent decades.
The Venerable Ampitiye Sri Rahula Maha Thero and Venerable Kotugoda Dhammawasa Maha Nayaka Maha Thero are exemplary personalities who impartially and unbiasedly live according to the rules and regulations which were constituted in Dhamma Vinaya.
Untrained and uneducated preachers are abundant in Sri Lanka in the name of the dispensation of the Buddha in this new millennium. Lack of proper training and knowledge of the Dhamma led them to express their own views and ideas in the name of the Buddha Dhamma. Unfortunately some unwise people blindly follow them as role models and frantically believe that these preachers are enlightened.
Though most individuals boast that they are Buddhists and take refuge in the Buddha, they blindly follow these undisciplined and untrained individuals, rather than following the Blessed One. They interpret and explicate birth, enlightenment of the Buddha and other historic incidents as they imagine and presume. 
This Cult of Personality drastically ruins and misguides innocent devoted disciples of the Buddha. Though above mentioned well renowned most venerable monks had delivered numerous Dhamma talks in the electronic media for many decades, they never had any ulterior motives and hidden agendas as present day hypocrites. Those respectable monks never misguided people in the name of Buddha Sasana.
Some people, both so called monks and laities have politicised the Three Refuges (The Buddha, The Dhamma and The Sangha). Lack of true knowledge, lack of correct practice, lack of true leadership qualities and inadequacy of discipline and training are the well known facts and distinct reality. Cultural values and religious ethics are utterly forgotten. The current unscrupulous demeanour of some monks is a very dangerous example for our future generation.
This may drive to ruin and damage the authenticity of the Buddhas words. Millions of followers listen to numerous sermons; preachers competitively verbalize and prattle with their own interpretations to entertain unwise listeners. 
Unfortunately, the deplorable and distressing fact is that individual branded credos and dogmas are proliferated and multiplied in the name of the Buddha Dhamma. 
There is no authority in the community of the Buddhist monks or responsible government to take any decisive and conclusive action to protect and preserve the doctrine and discipline (Dhamma Vinaya).
The quality and standard of the monkhood has been drastically changed. Many monks have embraced and engaged in party politics. The life style, the way of life, behaviour as a disciple of the Buddha, deportment of monkhood, duties and responsibilities as a monk is completely disappeared and is absent in certain individuals.
Unacceptable behaviour and disgraceful acts of so called monks have drastically changed peoples respectful attitudes and deep rooted devotion. The way they speak and express their antagonistic ideas and inimical views are completely dangerous and catastrophic. Our future generation will be in vulnerable situation and true spiritual practice will disappear. The Buddha declared that Vinayo Naama Sasanassa Aayu Discipline is the lifespan of the dispensation of the Buddha. Numerous well-disciplined and well trained monks have guided our Buddhist community with outstanding examples but now it is in topsy-turvy. 
Some mentally retarded and psychologically unfit individuals attempt to repair and renew their blemished reputations by using their own political views and racial provocations. Some of them have mixed the doctrine and are asking lay people to practise what monks should practise and monks are doing contrary to what they have to practise. 
Vinaya or discipline is very crucial fact in the dispensation of the Buddha Dhamma. As a monk or bhikkhu , he must be trained under his teacher or senior monk for at least five years after higher ordination. If teacher or senior monk does not allow him to perform activities such as delivering sermons, conducting meditation programmes or holding discussions, he must remain till he is given the permission. Unfortunately currently what has happened is catastrophic. There is no training or probation period for novices or bhikkhus, therefore they act and preach as they want. Innocent devotees are misguided and confused.
The current propensity and inconceivable proclivity in Sinhalese Buddhist community around the globe is indescribable. Listening to multitudes of sermons and taking part in meditation programmes are widely spread and fast growing cult of personality.
Hope that true scholars and well educated and well disciplined venerable Buddhist monks will reflect upon this unfortunate situation. Put everything on the right track for future generations to come. Good is restraint in the body; good is restraint in speech; good is restraint in thought. Restraint everywhere is good. The monk restrainted in every way is freed from all suffering.
That monk who has control over his tongue, is moderate in speech, unassuming and who explains the Teaching in both letter and spirit  whatever he says is pleasing.
-(The Dhammapada)
Hope these two stanzas will help some people to understand the true disciplines of the Buddha.

The quarry has become a curse to them!
	

A metal quarry located in an area of an ancient kingdom fame is posing a serious hazard to the residents in the locality, they say.

Stones hurled out by rock blasts while being a serious threat to life often damage the walls and the tiled roofs of houses around the quarry.
Whenever the tiles of a roof are damaged by flying stones from the quarry, the owner of the quarry, a kinsman of a powerful politico would offer to buy the affected householder roofing sheets, they say.
Residents also complain that blasting is being done with no regard for the legal limits on noise and vibration produced.
People in the area had complained to the powerful politico about the quarry that has become a curse to them during his visits to the area. He had promised on all such occasions to consider their problem, but there is no indication that he has taken their representations seriously, they say.

They want her out for not kowtowing to them!
	

There is a political heavyweight in yahapalanaya hailing from Digamadulla area trying his level best to send out on punishment transfer a fair white-collar high-up in the Kandiya division.

This fair white collar high- up at divisional level has incurred the wrath of the pro-yahapalanaya local politicos for not paying them the due respect, they say.
Following representations made to him by his local sidekicks, the political heavyweight has pressed the white-collar authority at the district level to transfer out the lady with no success so far.
The main allegation that the pro-government local politicos make against this fair white collar up is that she does not stand up and greet them when they call on her!

Trace Expert City should remain: Dr. De Silva
	
National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva yesterday said the sudden strike by railway employees over the Trace Expert City land issue was unwarranted and that the Tech-City should not be destroyed.
The State Minister said the government has already assured the railwayemployees that the issue would be discussed with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva next Monday.
The issue at the Trace Expert City in Colombo arose after the Cabinet approval was granted last month to construct a building as a new railway control centre in the premises. I was informed that a group of people had arrived at the Trace Expert City and they were attempting to mark and separate a land from the Trace City for the building. We informed the concerned railway employees that the issue would be taken with the Prime Minister and the Transport Minister next Monday. When we have already given an assurance, there is no need to go for a strike, he told a news briefing.
He said 10 acres from the railway department land had been allocated for the Trace Expert City where a number of tech and IT giants are based on and that there was a separate land of five acres 200 meters away from the Trace City premises.
The State Minister said the new control centre could be built using one acre of the separate five acre land which had not been utilized.
However, we have not come to a final decision as to where the building would be built. Thats why we organised the meeting with the Premier and the Transport Minister to make a final decision and informed this to railway employees. The railway Control Centre building should be built without destroying the Trace City, the only IT park in the country, he said.
Commenting on the Cabinet approved railway project, under which the railway control centre building would be built, State Minister Dr. De Silva said not even the fact finding mission of the project had been released yet.
It will come out in October this year and the funds for the project will be released only by next year. There is no need to strike over the issue when the project is not even in the horizon and an assurance had already been given to discuss the issue, he said.
Meanwhile, he rejected the reports that he threatened the railway employees when he visited them to discuss the issue and said the discussion was cordial.
The State Minister said the Trace Expert City, though it was launched by the previous government, was a commendable and a good initiative and that it should be protected.
The Trace City is growing rapidly. There are at least 1,200 employees who work here and the average salary of an employee is about Rs.175,000. This is a location where Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) are being created. We cant hold on the garments and shoes forever. Developing IT and IPR is the way forward. There are more than 10 IT companies are there and recently London Stock Exchange also moved in after buying Millennium IT which wrote the software for both Colombo and London Stock Exchange. Under the governments V2025 plan, which promotes knowledge based highly competitive economy, we should expand initiatives of this nature, he said.
He also in a Facebook post said Yes! Gotabaya Rajapaksa started the Tech City by renovating the dilapidated Tripoli market taken over by the Army during the war. And yes it is a very good thing. I have no problem appreciating what is good. That is mature politics. Also, some may recall it was I who protested when the land was to be given to a private developer who happened to be a close relation of a senior official at the time, (Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Section: Opinion

Tragedy doctoring the Health Service What JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa proposes is to produce more do
	
JVP MP moves wants two more medical faculties, saying country has only 50 per cent of required doctors
In addition to Teaching Hospitals medical faculties need more resources and facilities to turn out quality products
Already the existing medical faculties do not have the required full-time teachers
None of the successful campaigns against diseases had doctors involved-all were by PHIs and PHMs

Can more medical doctors reverse the continuing decline in our health service JVP member in Parliament Dr Nalinda Jayatissa has moved two private member motions to establish medical faculties at the Uva Wellassa and Moratuwa Universities, with Badulla and Nagoda Hospitals proposed as Teaching Hospitals. 
His argument is that Sri Lanka has only 50 per cent of the required number of medical doctors and medical faculties in State Universities can only accommodate 1,200 to 1,300 medical undergraduates each year-therefore, the need to establish two more medical faculties to increase the number of student intake. 
There is something rather sneaky in his proposal to have Nagoda Hospital as the Teaching Hospital for the proposed Moratuwa Faculty. Why go that far when there are two other hospitals much closer in Panadura and Bandaragama
Besides that, though a medical doctor, the JVP politician fails to understand that to produce a quality medical professional, a Teaching Hospital is not the only necessity. 
A Medical Faculty needs many more resources and facilities to turn out quality professionals. 
Though the GMOA and Deans of Medical Faculties in State Universities cry foul over the SAITM Medical Faculty, they are selfishly silent on the quality of education in their own medical faculties including Rajarata, Ruhuna (Karapitiya) and Eastern University. 
Most faculties dont have permanent qualified teaching staff and are wholly dependent on visiting professors and lecturers from elsewhere. 
The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), throttled by the GMOA mafia in decision making, has evaded this lapse and the necessity of having a permanent teaching staff in their draft on minimum standards in medical education by allowing medical professionals in Teaching Hospitals to be counted as teaching staff. 
This is one of the many reasons, the GMOA as a trade union, should be completely barred from running for positions in the SLMC and the reason, why the SLMC should be restructured anew to give it better representation from other professions and to societal interests.
The whole approach in shaping our health service with medical doctors and the argument that we need more medical doctors raises the vital question, what we as a society expect from our health service 
Do we want more and more patients to seek outdoor and indoor treatment in hospitals for medical doctors and specialists to have a thriving private practice 
Do we have to keep increasing the number of medical doctors to treat increasing numbers of patients Is that what we are looking for
The argument for more medical doctors, the JVP MP Dr Jayatissa is echoing, is one borrowed from his own ilk in the GMOA. 
If the existing number of medical doctors is 50 per cent of the required number, he should explain, why medical doctors are posted in numerous offices to attend to administrative work. 
On the Health Services, Minutes Gazetted in October 2014 that comes after the GMOA mafia endorses it, there are 324 administrative posts strictly for medical doctors. 
There are also 341 MOH positions for medical doctors. Lately, there are other stupidly unnecessary office positions created in the 25 RDHS offices with designations like MO-IT, MO - Planning and MO-Health Education, while in Colombo Hospitals, there are other posts that keep cropping up like MO-5S and MO-QC.
These office-based positions totalling around 800 dont need medical graduates. 
While increasing numbers of medical doctors take over such idling administrative positions, the overall health service is on the decline.

The alarming spread of Dengue Fever (DF) and Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) is one proof. 
The spread of dengue is mainly due to the callous disregard of the once very effective monitoring and regulating mechanism that was then under a Senior Public Health Inspector (PHI) but now controlled by medical doctors sitting in MOH Chairs.
With medical doctors in office as MOHs, not interested in enforcing monitoring proper and regulating, there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence in most Provinces although the highest incidence of DF/DHF is seen in the Western Province (44.9% in 2007). 
In the recent past, the incidence of DF/DHF has been more marked in the NCP (4.8% in 2004 vs. 11.8% in 2007), Wayamba (10.2% in 2004 vs. 15.9% in 2007) and Sabaragamuwa (6% in 2004 vs. 12.2% in 2007) and with 35,008 cases reported in 2009 with 346 deaths, according to the Epidemiology Unit of the Health Ministry. 
With all the rhetoric available from medical officers manning decision-making and implementing positions in the health sector, during the first three months of 2018, there were 14,627 reported cases of DF/DHF. 
The result is that we have hospitals with DF/DHF patients cramped everywhere in the hospitals.
In Sri Lanka, this needs to be stressed and emphasized with the GMOA mafia wanting to portray and project the medical profession as the sole saviour and guardian of our health services. It is a total and an absolute lie. 
It wasnt medical doctors who worked towards lifting Sri Lankas health status to that of the more advanced countries.
From hookworm to poliomyelitis, from malaria to whooping cough, smallpox and filariasis, all outbreaks and recurrences were eradicated through a well monitored and regulated community based preventive healthcare service handled by paramedical servicemen and not by medical doctors. 
PHIs played a very vital role in carrying out an islandwide awareness on personal hygiene and developing cleaner sanitation. They were responsible for creating a new generation that paid more attention to personal cleanliness and better family hygiene. It was also PHIs and the Midwives who played a very committed role in making immunization and vaccination programmes a success in the 1960s.
In the 1980s with WHO support and guidance the anti-leprosy campaign was efficiently and successfully carried through to declare leprosy as eradicated in 1992, without medical doctors playing any significant role. 
Now that medical doctors have taken over leprosy prevention, there is once again a warning of a possible increase in leprosy cases. 
Yet, another interesting piece of news was from Moneragala, when the now hyped Gam Peraliya development programme was launched over a month ago. It was reported, 25,000 households were without proper toilets. A special allocation was set aside for their construction. Truth is, if the MOH was effectively monitoring and regulating community health in his or her area, this lack of toilets should have been remedied, long before Gam Peraliya was launched. 
This also raises the question why allocations for their construction were channelled through the Divisional Secretariat (DS) and not through the MOH. 
The fact is, MOH is now a wholly irrelevant position in community life even after the spread of dengue fever. 
MOH is not seen or heard of even in dengue prevention campaigns that are carried through Development Officers in DS offices, LG councillors and local area Police, at times backed by the STF as well.
Therefore what we should as a society demand from our health service is a very strong preventive community healthcare system to reduce numbers admitted to hospitals. 
A preventive healthcare system makes hospitals in the curative healthcare system less important. Sri Lankas proud status on health rankings was achieved on a comparatively very low budget that depended more on preventive health care and sanitation than on curative healthcare and medical doctors.
Preventive community health care with trained paramedics checking on households regularly is certainly not as expensive as curative health care with sophisticated hospitals, long lists of expensive medicinal drugs prescribed by medical doctors and specialists, supported by semi-professional staff like MLTs, Radiographers and Physiotherapists. 
Sri Lanka needs to give more importance to preventive community health care over curative healthcare that should have a strict referral system.
We are wasting money on curative health with heavy investments going in search of the most modern and expensive health equipment to meet ever-increasing numbers of patients. 
This is due to GMOA backed medical professionals holding all key positions in the health hierarchy who are not pro-people as they project themselves to be. 
We also need to break out of international norms and standards, where and when necessary to design programmes for our own need(s). 
We should get back to the well-knit preventive healthcare service with paramedics at the community level that we had till the 70s. This can be redesigned under specially trained senior PHIs designated as Area Community Health Officers (ACHO) to clear out this mess. The ACHOs should also have well trained Public Health Midwives (PHM) in the field. 
The present WHO norm of having one PHI for 10,000 persons and one PHM for 3,000 persons should be revised for a more practically valid ratio.

It is humanly impossible for a PHM to care for 3,000 pregnant mothers and infants within a month that includes home visits too.

So is it with PHIs. The present MOH who is a medical doctor can thus be repositioned as the GP in outpatient dispensaries in ACHO divisions.
A community based preventive healthcare system would help reduce the heavy cost of producing medical doctors through low-quality medical faculties proposed at public expense. 
Experience during past decades proves that increasing the numbers of medical doctors produced does not in any way improve the health of people.
They only get comfortably absorbed into the thriving private sector health industry that lacks full-time medical doctors. 
Thus, what JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa actually proposes is to produce more medical doctors in the private sector health industry at public expense.
The medical profession now only feels money, not human pain.

Trilingual proficiency vital for reconciliation: PM
	
People in Sri Lanka, especially children, should learn Sinhala, Tamil and English languages in order to bring about reconciliation, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said on Thursday.
He said this at a ceremony held to felicitate schoolchildren who excelled in the second language at the GCE O/L examination in 2017.
If people learn Sinhala, then everyone should be conversant with the language of the majority. If one learns Tamil, then that person will be able to benefit from the development that is taking place in Tamil Nadu. One could get more benefits from South India than from Europe if he or she learns Tamil. Likewise, if one learns English, he or she will be benefitted when travelling to UK or USA.
There was a conflict between the Malays and the Tamils in Malaysia in late 1960s. Singapore saw this conflict and decided to introduce laws to nationalise Malay, Chinese and English languages to avoid a similar conflict. This is why there is no communal violence in Singapore today. Language is a bridge that connects ethnic and religious groups, he said. (Yohan Perera)

US allies have killed thousands of Yemenis
	

(c) 2018, The Washington Post  Sudarsan Raghavan  Jul 26, 2018 - 6:44 PM RAQAH, Yemen - The ground where the wedding tent once stood was covered with childrens slippers, broken musical instruments, pieces of festive clothing and other detritus of destroyed lives. Teeth, still attached to the jawbone, lay near some tattered decorations. 
An airstrike hit the wedding in this remote mountain village on April 23, killing 22 civilians including eight children, and injuring dozens, according to interviews with 17 villagers in late May. More than three years into Yemens civil war, over 16,000 civilians have been killed and injured, the vast majority by airstrikes, the U.N. human rights office estimates, adding that the figures are likely to be far higher.
The deaths are continuing unabated, with as many as hundreds of casualties per month, despite assurances by a U.S.-backed regional coalition to better protect civilians amid mounting criticism within the United States and the international community.

Where Anthare gets it right
	
In Sri Lanka, the government has historically been in cahoots with the private sphere when it comes to the most common sectors (education and healthcare)
Lahiru Weerasekara, convenor of the Inter University Students Federation or IUSF, better known as Anthare, is a colourful if not divisive figure. He inspires love and hate, sometimes on the same terms. He is derided by those who wish to dismantle the States grip on education and admired by those who wish to preserve the free in free education. It is difficult to ascribe to him every strike action and demonstration that his outfit has carried out, but if there ever were a student leader who epitomised the angst of the moment, the agitation against the privatisation of education, it is he. A friend of mine pointed out recently that everyones a radical as long as he does not have children, is not married, and is committed to the hilt with an ideology he or she entertains as the absolute truth. Lahiru Weerasekara does not have children, is not married, and entertains a particularly compelling ideology as the absolute truth. He is no hero of mine, but that ideology of his is compelling enough, so I am with him.
There are two schools of thought regarding higher education in this country. One school contends that free education must of necessity stop at the point a student completes his secondary education, i.e. his A/Levels. Reasons given as justifications for this point of view usually include the fact that the State, meagre as its finances are when it comes to funding government institutions, must buckle up even more when it comes to university education. Proponents of this school contend that what is needed is a vibrant private sector to cater to those who a)cant enter a local university and b) can pay through higher education if given a chance or choice. Since complete privatisation is untenable if not impractical, they contend further, the ideal system would be a private-public partnership, such as the one implemented and carried out at the Kotelawala Defence Academy. They are not supporters of the free market, they are realists, and as realists, they (at least vaguely) want to balance equity and equality.
The other school of thought opposes any reform in this regard, and to this end wants the State to maintain its grip on higher education. They believe that the government is not doing enough, that it should be spending at least 6% of the GDP on universities and other institutions of higher education (trade colleges, industrial schools, what-not), and that it should do away with private colleges and universities which offer degrees that cannot strictly be monetised and hence exist outside the bounds of the free market (medicine and engineering being just two of these). In other words, not only are they against the commoditisation of education (where they are correct), they are also insistent that whatever attempt the State makes in compromising on their principles and shared perspectives is an act of aggression that can only end in the complete privatisation of education (where they are dogmatic). Given that in Sri Lanka, the government has historically been in cahoots with the private sphere when it comes to the most common sectors (education and healthcare), they are correct.
Where do I stand, and where should we stand Ideally in neither camp, but given that these are divisive times and given that we happen to live in a divisive society, a choice must be made. Malinda Seneviratne once wrote that while education must not be sold off for a song and two cents, this does not give unbridled licence to oppose the entry of students to private institutions if those two above points, i.e. they cant enter a local University and can pay through those private institutions, are met. But Marx and Engels made it impossible for us to stand with them without opposing Adam Smith, and the Marxists of the 20th century made it impossible for us to support Castro and oppose American imperialism while supporting reform movements in the former camp. In that sense, the divide between Lahiru Weerasekara and Neville Fernando can never be resolved. If we are to stand with the former, we have to oppose the latter. And given the reality today, I am not so sure whether I want to stand with the latter.
Heres why.
Around a year ago, a prominent online news and comment site ran several opinion pieces from students who had been cheated at their A Levels and thus of an opportunity to pursue their dreams to become doctors without leaving Sri Lanka. One after another, and one testimony after another, these students argued that they did not want to leave the country, that they wanted to give back to the people who had funded them (parents and relatives in the case of those who had studied in private schools; the entire public in the case of those who had studied in local schools). For a while at least, these essays worked, and they won the sympathy of a number of objective, unbiased readers. But then, as one piece piled up on top of another, other comments began flowing in. The writers of these comments made one point: that these students had been planted and that as students of a derided private medical institution they had a bias for the continuation of its interests. Their case was compelling, and yet, it failed to account for one important fact: the disparity between their access to privilege (from English-speaking backgrounds) and the lack of access thereto of a majority who made it to local universities and had to make the hard yards to make it there.
The simple truth then is that the government, outdated though its institutions may be, is nevertheless reining in on the need to qualify educational attainments by means of universally accepted metrics and thresholds
No amount of testimonials can erase this fact, which is a result of decades of class differences that have gone unchecked and have been institutionalised in the public and private sphere. (Ill explore this in next weeks piece.) The simple truth then is that the government, outdated though its institutions may be, is nevertheless reining in on the need to qualify educational attainments by means of universally accepted metrics and thresholds. In the absence of a profit motive, Sri Lankas higher education sector is determined, on paper at least, to match result with performance and performance with result. This is true not just of academic qualifications, it is also true of professional qualifications (especially accountancy). After all, while the State can be faulted for indulging in age-old and primitive mindsets, it can hardly be faulted for lowering standards by, for instance, taking students through hard modules and topics and then assessing them on easy MCQ and computer based exams. And yet, that is what most private degree awarding institutions are doing now. Where are the quality checks
Of course, those who bat for private education will say that standards have not gone tumbling down and they are aware always of the need to balance the need for profits with the need for academic performance. But private degree awarding institutions, in Sri Lanka, are assessed by those bodies they are affiliated to, elsewhere, on the basis of success rates. Whos to say that either those institutions or those bodies, given the prevalence of moneyed interests in both, will not privilege profit over performance and jack up those success rates by, for instance, lowering minimal requirements
This is a real threat, and it is a threat that has been borne out by evidence. Not here, but in Britain and the West as a whole. In July 2016, for instance, an article in The Guardian raised questions about Pearson and its pervasive influence on English school life. While that influence is much more readily accepted in the United States, where private education is rampant, critics in Britain doubt the ability of for-profit-ventures planning out national exam standards. Of particular concern was the fact that Pearson then was managed by an educationist who had once contended that Ministers must allow state-run schools to be run for profit, which led to this observation being made by a best-selling writer on US education reform: The corporation [Pearson] is acting as a quasi-government agency in several instances, but it is not a quasi-government agency: it is a business that sells products and services. What part of the field of education does Pearson not manage At what point do conflicts of interest arise Is it acting in the best interests of students, of the nation, or of its own business Apt.
Heres the deal. Britain, like Sri Lanka, historically has had an education sector reliant on decrees from the centre. It is no cause for surprise then that the ruckus over some British universities imported here has to do with the fact that those universities are, back home, not that well recognised or for that matter respected. Unlike Sri Lanka, though, Britain does not boast of a lecturers union or students association that can match up to FUTA or IUSF. This is an important point, because once educational standards start to come down, once the fight for free and comprehensive education takes on an inescapable, national character (it already has), we would need associations that are vehemently concerned over the one issue which brings an unlikely parvenu like me on to the same pedestal occupied by Lahiru Weerasekara: that the profit motive, while cohabiting rather tensely with academic performance in the West, can hardly be expected to cohabit with it once transplanted to Sri Lanka. Besides, we have a macabre history of tinkering with education. If it takes a Lahiru Weerasekara to stop that tinkering, I am afraid we have no choice but to stand with him to put a stop to it.

A total Lunar eclipse will occur in the 1st quarter of Suvana constellation in the Zodiacal sign of Capricorn (Makara) when the Moon will pass through the centre of earths shadow beginning 22.45 hours (local time) on Friday July 27.
The greatest eclipse will occur at 01.42 hours on July 28 Saturday and will end at 4.59 hours the same day. It will be visible in our country and most parts of Asia, Australia, Africa, Europe and South America.
The 2nd Lunar eclipse in the year 2018, this is the 21st centurys longest Lunar eclipse with the totality lasting for 103 minutes.
According to the ancient Indian Rishis it is inauspicious to start any important event in life or embark on any plan or program for that matter on the day of a Solar or Lunar eclipse and during the three days both preceding and following the day of the eclipse counting a total of seven days.
It is also the general opinion of the savants of Astrology that it is inauspicious to commence any important event or plan during the running of either the Zodiacal sign or the constellation in which the eclipse occurs either on the day of the eclipse or within the seven days preceding or the following the day of the eclipse which add up to 15 days.

After fires, floods hit Greek capital
	

ATHENS AFP July26, 2018- Heavy rains led to flash flooding Thursday in the north of Athens, three days after devastating wildfires killed scores of people in the region around the Greek capital. 
Fire services said they received at least 10 calls from motorists whose vehicles were stranded when roads became rivers after storms in the upscale districts of Maroussi and Ekali. 
A civil defence spokesman said dozens of cars were stuck on several main roads after the early afternoon downpour, adding that traffic was gradually returning to normal. 
Firefighters said around 160 residents were briefly trapped in their homes due to the flooding. 
Some rain fell on the coastal region of Mati, 25 kilometres east of the capital, where more than 80 people lost their lives on Monday night when wildfires tore through homes and hotels. 
The defence ministry said the army had been called in to remove debris and dig drainage channels to prevent flooding in the fire-ravaged area.

This ceremony will be followed by the 72nd Sri Sangharaja Perahera
Saranankara Samanera could not obtain the help of the king to foster Buddhism
Ven. Saranankara Samanera Thera did not like the ways of Ganinnanses

Ven. Welivita Sri Saranankara Sangharaja Thero will be commemorated at a ceremony to be held at Malwatte Maha Viharaya in Kandy on July 27 (Friday), which is marked as Esala Poya in the Buddhist calendar. Ven. Thibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Maha Nayake Thera is expected to preside over the ceremony, which is scheduled to begin at 2.30 pm. 
This ceremony will be followed by the 72nd Sri Sangharaja Perahera which will parade the streets of Kandy. This ceremony is patronized by the Mahanayake Thero. Assistance will be provided by the senior members of the Karaka Sabha, Ven. Mahopadyaya Agga Maha Panditha Aluthgama Dhammananda Nayake Thero and his pupil Ven. Ketayapathane Piyadassi Nayake Thero, Karaka Sabha member P.B. Dissanayake, Governor Central Provincial Council Tikiri Kobbekaduwa, L.H. Harischandra, President Sri Sangharaja Gunanusmarana Sangamaya Sarath Perera, Secretary Chapa Weeraratne, Treasurer of the Sangamaya Kusuma Weeraratne, President of the Kantha Sangamaya, Secretary to the Governor Kesara Senanayake, Major H.M.T. Hitisekara, District Secretary Palitha Bandara, Divisional Secretary Parakrama Jayawardena, Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs and representatives of various Buddhist societies in Kandy, Kandy Municipal Council, Sri Sangharaja Daham Pasala and Sri Dalada Maligawa. 
Ven. Welivita Saranankara Sangharaja Thera was born in a village called Welivita near Thumpane in Kandy District on 18th June 1698.
His father was Mudlier Kulatunga. He was given the name Kulatunga Banda. He was ordained at the Swiyapoda Raja Maha Viharaya by the Viharadhipathi Kithsirimevan Rajasundera Gurunnanse who was also the Viharadhipathi of Poya Malu Viharaya of Malwatte Maha Viharaya. 
There were monks who received higher ordination during this time. Only novices were in-change of Viharayas. As king Veera Parakrama Narendrasighe (1707-1739), who ruled the country during this period, was in close association with Rev. Jacome Gonsalves, the missionary from Goa to Sri Lanka. The Catholic literature of the Catholic Church predicted the complete eradication of Buddhist doctrine within few years. Saranankara Samanera could not obtain the help of the king to foster Buddhism, but he was successful in getting the help of the king to inaugurate the first pirivena at Niyamakanda in Udunuwara. 
Decline in the Buddhist order
Ven. Saranankara Samanera Thera did not like the ways of Ganinnanses, priests who were ordained, but had wives and children in Viharayas. He organised a separate Bhikku clan called Silvath Samagama. The church did not like this Silvath Samagama and went on a murder spree by poisoning many Samaneras of this samagama. A conspiracy hatched by the chief priest of the Christian Church to poison the Sangharaja through Kaffirs was exposed and information was sent to the Dutch Governor who ruled the coastal areas. He deported the Christian chief priest to his homeland. This was narrated in the book Mandaram Puwatha. 
The first Sri Sangharaja Perahera was held on July 25, 1947, starting from Daluggolla Raja Maha Viharaya, Ampitiya, where the remains of Sangharaja were cremated
All aspirations of Ven. Saranankara Thera were fulfilled after King Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe (17471782 AC) ascended the throne. 
The king was able to obtain the help of the Dutch to provide the ship Tharka for the emissaries to travel to Siam (Thailand) to bring Bhikkhus for higher ordination. 
King Dharmika of Siam sent 21 Bhikkhus, eight novices and three Siamese ministers by a Siamese ship which landed at the Trincomalee harbour on Esala Poya Day in 1746 AC. Sri Lankan Ministers returned to Colombo by the Dutch ship. The historic Upasampadawa was held at the Visumgrama Seema Malakaya Uposathagaraya of Malwatte Maha Viharaya in 1753 by Upali Maha Thera of Siam. These efforts helped establish a clan of Bhikkus called Shiamopali Maha Nikaya, (combination of two words Shiam and Upali became Shiamopali). 
Annual pageant
Ven. Aluthgama Dhammananda Thera of Malwatte Maha Viharaya inaugurated the Sri Sangharaja Gunanusmarana Sangamaya, Kandy on 15th May 1947, at a meeting held at Sri Pushpadana Society Hall. This ceremony was presided over by Ven. Rambukwelle Sri Sobitha Maha Nayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter. The monk decided to hold an annual perahera (Pageant) to commemorate Sangharaja along with other activists. 
The first Sri Sangharaja Perahera was held on July 25, 1947, starting from Daluggolla Raja Maha Viharaya, Ampitiya, where the remains of Sangharaja were cremated. Here a Chaithya was constructed by King Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe enshrining the ashes a Sangharaja along with the sacred relics the Gautama Buddha. 
The Sangharaja statue was unveiled by Pananwala Basnayaka Nilame of Srimath Upulwan Devalaya while a pageant organised by C.B Nugawela, Diyawadena Nilame paraded the streets of Kandy and concluded at Mawatte Maha Viharaya.

Eliminating  stigma associated with Mental disorders
	

 A mental health issue is like any other medical issue, or is it What would you do if you have fever, or severe abdominal pain The majority of us would not hesitate to seek medical help, if we think that it may be something serious. But are we honestly giving mental disorders the same attention that we give physical illnesses Even though 1 in every 4 people worldwide is likely to suffer from a mental disorder, according to the WHO, many people are reluctant to seek help, due to the stigma associated with mental illnesses.
Today, on Health Capsule, we have consulted Dr. Udena Attigalle, Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, Teaching Hospital Karapitiya, in the hope of obtaining more information on mental health disorders, as education is an important component of removing the stigma associated with mental health issues. 

Its not all black and white
Mental health issues are a spectrum, varying from mild to severe, explains Dr. Attygalle. The spectrum for each category of mental health issue consists of various signs. Milder symptoms are named as problems, while moderate to severe symptoms are likely to be diagnosed as a disorder. For it to be diagnosed as a disorder it has to affect ones life significantly, the doctor clarifies. Have you ever felt down, hopeless, losing interest in the things that you usually love, even for a short period of time Then its likely that you have been placed in the spectrum of mental health issues; specifically that of depression, at some point in your life. 

Common mental health issues
If you take a random patient suffering from mental illnesses, you are more likely to get a person who is depressed, anxious or a child with a behavioral disorder, rather than a person who fits the image of what the society preconceives asmental illness. This, according to the doctor, is because these are the most prevailing mental health issues in todays society. 

Physical illnesses vs mental illnesses
If you or one of your loved ones has ever suffered from a mental health issue, you may have heard advises like Get over it, its all on your mind and You are not sick. We ask the doctor, Are these true Is it all in our minds. Just as there are changes in your bodys chemical composition when you are physically ill, there are chemical as well as physiological changes associated with mental illnesses as well, he explains. But, since most of these changes occur in specific areas of the brain, which is an extremely complex organ, these changes are difficult to detect, he clarifies further. 
Take, for an example, Dengue fever and Severe Depression. While both have the capacity to cause much harm, even death and depression cannot be diagnosed or monitored through blood tests, unlike dengue fever. Some of these changes can be observed through advanced imaging like FMRI, but are difficult to use as diagnostic tools. 

Underlying causes
Most Mental Disorders have a strong genetic component associated with them. In simpler words, the risk of developing a mental illness is higher in people whose close relatives are having mental disorders, when compared to the general population. But mental illnesses have a strong association with environmental factors like stressful life events and bereavements as well. But how these affect a person varies from each individual. Out of two people living in the same kind of environment undergoing similar life stresses, only one may develop a mental health issue. Its also affected by the social background of a person, especially the social support he receives. A child with absentee parents and no friends is at a more risk of developing a mental health disorder. 
Mental health issues have an association with the personality of the individual as well. A person who tends to look at the negative side of life and gets easily disheartened will be more susceptible to depression than a person with a more optimistic view of life. 
There is something called the Bio Psycho Social model, which is used to describe the aetiology of mental health disorders, explains the doctor. This demonstrates that mental disorders are a result of a combination of Biological, Genetic factors, Psychological and social factors rather than due to a single aetiology. 

Negative effects due to stigma
Stigma is mainly twofold; stigma that has a link with the public which may sometimes cause you to avoid a person showing signs of ill mental health, and self stigma, where a patient fears stigma from the society and avoids either social interactions or seeking medical attention. 
Generally, the help seeking behaviour is very poor in the society with regard to mental health. The stigma associated with mental ill health plays a major part in
this regard.
Patients and family members tend to ignore the symptoms until the patient is severely ill and needs to seek medical advice. The major disadvantage of this situation is that in most mental disorders, the potential for complete cure drastically reduces by delaying treatment. 
In addition, the quality of life of a patient with a diagnosed mental disorder is significantly lowered due to the wrong perceptions the society has of him or her. The prospect of finding employment reduces and the patient being isolated from the society leads to poor self esteem and depression. This may make his condition worse. The first thing that we need to understand when it comes to the stigma associated with mental disorders is that contrary to popular belief, the majority of the patients with mental disorders can be treated. They function well in the society just like you and I. 

Eliminating stigma
What is our role in reducing the stigma associated with mental health Accurate information and being educated about the condition is the main enemy of stigma, explains Dr. Attygalle. Knowing that the genetic and environmental causes as well as individual factors contribute in causing mental disorders, understanding that there is a wide spectrum of mental disorders is prevalent in the world and that many of them are treatable is a good initiation to understanding about mental disorders. 
Having positive experiences associated with mental health conditions is another way of reducing stigma. You may have a friend who has suffered from depression, but copes better than you and I when faced with a stressful situation. Understanding that they are humans who are simply suffering from an illness is also crucial. 
The role of the media associated with mental health is large, though sadly, more frequently than not, this opportunity is used to spread negative messages about mental ill health. Understanding how the media and entertainment industry reflect on mental disorders is not always accurate, that violence and aggression associated with mental disorders are exceptions, rather than the rule. This is vital towards eliminating stigma associated with mental health. 
One final message to our readers who are or who know someone who is suffering from a mental health issue: Even though its not visible outwardly, mental disorders can be equally painful as physical illnesses. Do not hesitate to seek help from a qualified psychiatrist, since as we highlighted previously in the article, the chance treatment being successful is high, in seeking medical care early.

Global campaign to  test and treat Hepatitis Eliminating the disease is the immediate need of the ho
	

Hepatitis is one of those infections that people are less aware of. Unless tested, one wouldnt detect this viral infection as its symptoms appear only in selected instances. Hence the global campaign launched by the World Health Organisation (WHO) aims to test and treat this infection before it spreads to the rest of the world population. Statistics reveal that around 325 million people around the world are living with viral Hepatitis while 290 million of them are unaware ofthe symptoms. 
In view of World Hepatitis Day, which is annually celebrated on July 28, the Daily Mirror spoke to Dr. Lalindra Dias, Consultant Physician at the District General Hospital  Nuwara Eliya, who elaborated on the types of Hepatitis, symptoms, treatment and prevention. 

Inflammation of the liver
Hepatitis is the inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis infections are prevalent among countries with a poor socio-economic status. As such Sri Lanka too is affected as a result of varieties of Hepatitis infections. Infections could be contracted by both males, females and children. The condition can be self-limiting or could progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver cancer.


Types
According to Dr. Dias there are both infectious and non-infectious causes of Hepatitis. Infectious causes include Hepatitis A,B,C,D and E while there are various non-infectious causes, he said. Among the most common non-infectious causes is Nonalcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH) also known as Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver disease. Alcohol is another leading cause of non-infectious Hepatitis. Various medications such as paracetamol and anti-inflammatory drugs for pain relief should be avoided. This also includes limiting the excessive usage of herbal preparations. Other causes included autoimmune diseases and genetic and familial causes,the doctor added.

Infectious types
Among the infectious types of Hepatitis, Hepatitis A and E are most common, Dr. Dias added. These two types are mainly transmitted through faeco-oral transmissions. These transmissions occur when patients dont have good toilet practices and due to lack of poor sanitation. In turn they touch food and water and the infection is carried on. This is a common infection during floods and among people who live in slums and close communities. However there are vaccinations to prevent the Hepatitis A infection. On the other hand Hepatitis B and C are transmitted through unprotected sexual practices withunknown partners.
Another reason is due to sharing of intravenous needles among drug users and very rarely through emergency blood transfusions. But nowadays the transmission through blood and blood products is extremely rare due to widely available high-tech screening programmes. These two types could also be transmitted from an infected mother to a foetus,he explained. Speaking further Dr. Dias said that other infectious causes such as dengue fever and leptospirosis could also lead up to
Hepatitis infection. 

Non-infectious types
As mentioned before, NASH is one of the common causes of non-infectious Hepatitis. This is common among patients with diabetes, high cholesterol and those who are obese, Dr. Dias continued. In order to prevent NASH it is important to control diabetes and reduce weight. In addition to that, high intakes of alcohol could lead to Hepatitis infections and patients could end up having cirrhosis,he affirmed.
How do you know that you are infected
Some of the acute features include the following :
High fever
	Body aches, lethargy and fatigue
	Severe loss of appetite
	Jaundice  discolouration of eyes and skin
	Passage of dark-coloured urine   nSevere abdominal pain on the right side. 
If one develops the above symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor, Dr. Dias added. Usually Hepatitis A and E improve without many complications. But Hepatitis B and C could lead to chronic Hepatitis and patients could ultimately end up with cirrhosis. It could sometimes also culminate in conditions such as livercancer.he said.

Prevention and treatments
He further said that the Hepatitis infection could cause grave consequences such as cirrhosis, cancer and ultimately death. Therefore it is important to prevent it to the best of your ability, he continued. This could be achieved through safe sexual practices, cutting down on excessive consumption of alcohol, not sharing intravenous drug needles, controlling diabetes and reducing weight. If you have the above symptoms, it is important that you seek medical attention. The doctor will do a couple of blood tests while testing liver enzymes and doing an ultrasound scan of the liver. he said.
According to Dr. Dias, Hepatitis A and E require symptomatic management. This includes controlling the temperature, keeping the patient hydrated and avoiding liver-toxic drugs. While at the hospital, the doctors will safeguard the patient from further liver damage. Hepatitis could also be cured through vaccinations; for example Hepatitis B is already included in the National Immunisation Schedule. It is also advisable to get the Hepatitis A vaccination before travelling to countries such as India and Africa,he stressed.

Aftercare
Once a patient has recovered from a Hepatitis infection he or she should take precautions, he added. As such a patient shouldnt take painkillers such as paracetamol, anti-inflammatory drugs and also avoid the excessive usage ofherbal medications.
Patients should also cut down on the excessive consumption of alcohol and recreational drugs. Those who have been infected with Hepatitis A and E should engage in good sanitary and hygienic practices so that the infection isnt transmitted to others. If a child has contracted Hepatitis, it is advisable that he or she doesnt attend school during this period. It is the same with adults and patients are advised to rest as much as possible. In order to prevent Hepatitis B and C there are anti-viral agents that could be administered to patients,he said.


World Hepatitis Day 2018

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) viral hepatitis B and C are major health challenges, affecting 325 million people globally. They are root causes of liver cancer and leads to 1.34 million deaths every year. 
Hepatitis B and C are chronic infections that may not show symptoms for a long period; sometimes years or decades. At least 60% of liver cancer cases are due to late testing and treatment of viral hepatitis B and C. Low coverage of testing and treatment is the most important gap to be addressed in order to achieve the global elimination goals by 2030. 
WHO will focus on the theme: Test. Treat. Hepatitis in view of World Hepatitis Day 2018. WHO organises events and activities with the aim to achieve the following objectives globally, in regions and in countries: 
To support scale-up of hepatitis prevention, testing, treatment and care services, with specific focus on promoting WHO testing and treatment recommendations; 
	To showcase best practices and promote universal health coverage of hepatitis services;
	To improve partnerships and funding in the fight againstviral hepatitis.

Lessons not learnt From Black July and aftermath India had stressed that it would not accept a Tamil
	
1983 is a real story of a community that lived scattered among and besieged by a section of another community
It strengthened the hands of the separatist Tamil armed groups by thousand fold
Majority of Sinhalese did not participate in this national crime. Neither did they put an effort to stop this madness
The 1983 anti-Tamil riot was not an isolated incident. It was an extension of similar incidents
Sinhala and English media provoked the ethnic feelings of their audiences, while the Tamil media whipped up separatist ideology

So many articles had been published in newspapers this week about the 1983 ethnic riots, commonly known as the Black July.
Tamil papers reported several commemorative events that had been held in the north, especially at the Jaffna University premises which is fast becoming a hotbed of Tamil nationalism since lately.
July 24 this year marked the 35th Remembrance of the beginning of a week-long anti-Tamil riot that totally crippled the Government machinery during which, goons torched and looted houses and vehicles belonging to Tamils and killed people at their will.
Yet, the question remains as to what we, the Sri Lankans, irrespective of race, religion or political party, have learnt from the riot, its backdrop and the subsequent history.
Most of those belong to the present younger generation, even the Tamils, except those entrapped in Mullivaikkal during the last few weeks of the war, would not feel the horror that the Tamils in southern parts of the country experienced during those dreadful dark days.
For many, it is something like a narration about a movie or a novel. But it was the real story of a community that lived scattered among and besieged by a section of another community.
Apart from those trapped in Mullivaikkal in 2009, only those Muslims in Aluthgama, Beruwala, Digana, Teldeniya and surrounding areas might be able to realise what is really meant by being besieged by racists.
Majority of Sinhalese did not participate in this national crime. Neither did they put an effort to stop this madness.
A large majority of them were mere spectators of arson attacks, looting and even killing, while a small number risked their lives in protecting Tamils, known and unknown.
Hence, the Tamils who were yet to be attacked then were perturbed as to whom to trust or whom to fear. Anarchy in its total sense had swallowed up the entire country with goons killing, looting and torching properties and human beings under the very nose of the law enforcement authorities.
The riot and the rioters were not able to wipe out the Tamils from the surface of Sri Lanka, whether they intended to do so or not.
But on the contrary, it strengthened the hands of the separatist Tamil armed groups by a thousand fold. And it was this incident that brought in international pressure on the country in respect of the ethnic imbroglio which has now landed the country before the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC).
The 1983 anti-Tamil riot was not an isolated incident. It was an extension of similar incidents but with a reduced degree of ferocity that occurred during the very tenure of President J.R. Jayewardene.
In the wake of the 1977 General Election victory by Jayewardenes party, the United National Party (UNP) that won 140 out of the 168 seats in the National State Assembly (the then Parliament) revenge attacks against the members of the Constituent Parties of the former United Front Government spread around the country.
Soon these violent attacks were directed towards Tamils and Tamil-owned houses, shops and vehicles were torched and looted in many areas south of Vavuniya.
The anti-Tamil hatred that time was not without reason. It was in the previous year that the Tamil United Front (TUF) was renamed as Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) with a resolution to carve out a separate State called Tamil Eelam for Tamils, within the territory of Sri Lanka, at the famous Vaddukkoddai Convention of the TUF.
Yet, the resolution did not hold much water among Tamils until the Tamil Eelam fever was generated during the 1977 General Election campaign, with the TULF having it as its campaign theme.
This had given a negative message to the south and thus had triggered the anti-Tamil attacks, after the election.
President Jayewardene aggravated the situation with a provocative public utterance against the Tamil leaders If you want war let it be war if you want peace to let it be peace.
The first and the only elections for the newly formed District Development Councils (DDC) which meant for the resolution of the ethnic problem were held in June 1981.
It was during this election campaign that the precious Jaffna Public Library was torched by the goons sent by the Southern politicians.
The tense situation prevailed all over the country after the election soon turned against Tamils, especially those living in the plantation areas. That was the second communal riot during the tenure of J.R. Jayewardene.
The negative message spread in the south over the separatist trend in the north was not allowed to subside by various Tamil armed groups, who had started to shoot at members of the Police and the Armed forces, who had been posted at various places in the Jaffna town, even in broad daylight.
The south was aghast to hear when 13 soldiers were killed at Tirunelveli in Jaffna in the night of June 23, 1983, as it was the largest number of soldiers killed at the hands of the Tamil armed groups then. Rest is history. However, later the south was almost unresponsive when the LTTE overran the Elephant Pass Army camp complex that housed about 11,000 soldiers.
If one peruses the media behaviour immediately prior to 1977, 1981 and 1983 riots he or she would observe the role of the media in fermenting communal strife on either side of the ethnic divide.
Sinhala and English media provoked the ethnic feelings of their audiences, while the Tamil media whipped up separatist ideology.
Even 35 years after the Black July the situation has not changed. The three-decade-long war has taught us nothing.
Now, anything demanded by the Tamils and Muslims- be it even a demand for the transfer of the Chief Secretary of Northern Provincial Council or a separate

Kachcheri for the Tamil speaking eastern coastal area of the Ampara District - are viewed as Separatist demands.
Every aspect of the proposed new Constitution is branded as an attempt to carve out a separate Tamil State.
Where would the frustration ultimately lead the Tamil youth in the future History has the answer. The frustration is already being witnessed by facts such as glorifying of former State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran.
On the other hand, those Tamil leaders who ran away from the north and the east and hid in Colombo during the height of the separatist war are now drumming up separatist slogans and calling for the revival of the slain LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran.
One cannot find fault with the commemoration of people killed in the war and even the sacrifices by the LTTE cadres and also with the struggles for the rights of the Tamils, so long as those events would not reinforce separatist ideology among Tamils.
But some Tamil leaders still get involved in these events in a manner that creates or toughens separatist zeal among the Tamil youth, just for political gains.
The lesson they have not learnt from history is that the geopolitical situation in the region would never allow the creation of a separate Tamil State within the territory of Sri Lanka and any such attempt would only be another catastrophe.
India as far back as 1988 had stressed that it would not accept the carving out of a Tamil State near its southernmost State, which houses a homogeneous populace.
This geopolitical situation has invalidated even the once prominent debate among Leftists whether Tamils have the right to secede.
Ignoring this geopolitical reality by the LTTE resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people from all three communities. Todays Tamil leaders are yet to learn it.

Macron denies bodyguard was his lover or ever had Frances nuclear codes
	

France, (Daily Mail), , 26 July 2018 - French President Emmanuel Macron rubbished baseless claims his disgraced ex-bodyguard was his lover.
Alexandre Benalla, 26, was sacked as Macrons head of security last week after a video of him wearing a police helmet and beating protesters emerged. 
He has now been arrested and taken into police custody, with the President branding his actions disappointing and a betrayal.
In a statement to MPs he said Benalla was not his lover and joked he did not have access to any codes for Frances nuclear weapons.
He said to his fellow En Marche representatives on Tuesday: Alexandre Benalla has never had the nuclear codes  Alexandre Benalla is not my lover.
He continued: What happened on May 1 is terrible, serious and, for me, it was a disappointment and a betrayal. The French leader launched an attack on the media coverage of the scandal, which has sent his popularity ratings plummeting, reports The Telegraph. 
He said: We have a press that no longer seeks truth. The media says, Look. Looped images of a scene [of Mr Benallas violence], which is unacceptable and which I condemn.
But I would like to see the scene before, the scene after, the context, what happened.
It came after unprecedented scenes in Paris, where police detectives yesterday raided the Elysee Palace in connection with the investigation into Benalla.

The Gama ray spectrometer that is worth over Rs 8 million has been donated to the project by the International Atomic Agency (IAA).
Under the guidance of the GSMB Chairman Asela Iddawela, the project is to cover the entire land area at a cost of little more than Rs 100 million and would be funded through its annual budgetary allocations.
The GSMB had already completed the survey in two out of 21 sheets of 1: 100,000 scale island map that includes Kandy and Matale districts.
The second phase of the survey is to conduct in Elpitiya and suburban areas in Tuesday (31).
Speaking to Daily Mirror, GSMB Senior Director Udaya de Silva said the survey will identify Nuclear Raw Materials including Monazite, Lanthanum, Cerium, Thorite and Thorianite.
He said that although the car-born method is less efficient it was very cost effective comparing to air-born method.
Australia based Margosa Graphite Ltd (Margosa), together with Lanka Resources and Mining (Pvt) Ltd (LRM) in last year commenced a joint Electro Magnetic (EM) survey to search for new graphite deposits in Sri Lanka using air-born data.
However, it was learned that this was the first attempt to use Car-born Gama Ray Spectrometer to identify radioactive anomalous areas in the country.
Mr. de Silva said that in 1918 to 1922 Monazite was found in Kaikawala Beach at Bentota and they were sold to foreign countries then due to their expensiveness. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

No proposal to take controlling stake in Mattala Airport: India
	
The Civil Aviation Ministry of India on Thursday said that there is no proposal under consideration for the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to buy a controlling stake in Sri Lanka's Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, the Economic Times reported.
In the Lok Sabha, BJP member Poonam Mahajan has asked whether the AAI is considering purchasing a controlling stake in the Mattala airport, thereby gaining ownership of the airport.
"No madam. No such proposal is under consideration at present," Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha said in a written reply.
To the query on whether the AAI would build a flying school and a maintenance, repair and overhaul unit at the Mattala airport, Sinha replied in the negative.
On July 19, Sri Lanka's Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva had told the country's Parliament that the AAI has been asked to submit its business plan for operating the loss-making Mattala airport.
The USD 210 million facility, 241-km south-east of Colombo, is dubbed the "world's emptiest airport".
The airport was officially opened in March 2013. The only international flight operating from there was halted in May due to recurrent losses and flight safety issues.

PC polls under old system or new mixed system: Parliament should decide
	
The Chairman of the Elections Commission Mahinda Deshapriya said that unless a system is decided upon by the Parliament, the Provincial Council Elections cannot be held in whatever manner.
In reply to a query made by our sister paper Lankadeepa, Deshapriya said that it is the Parliament that should decide whether the Provincial Councils are to be held under the old preferential system or under the new mixed system, and until the Parliament arrives at a decision and clears legal barriers, the election commission is unable to do anything.
If the elections are to be held under the new mixed system, the delimitation report has to be approved by Parliament, otherwise, if it is to be held under the old preferential system the new Act has to be abolished. Both these decisions have to be taken by the Parliament and it is now in the hands of the 225 members including the Speaker and the Prime Minister.
Some Politicians are saying that the Election Commission can hold elections. This is a complete canard. A system has to be decided upon and intimated to us until that time we cannot do anything.
He also said that the commission feels regretted over the Provincial Elections getting postponed. Delay in holding elections is wrong. Under Democracy the base of ruling power is peoples wish, which is expressed through an election. Therefore postponing elections is undemocratic Deshapriya further said. (Ranjan Kasthuri)

## Title: Please release term test results!

Please release term test results!
	
Teachers have become news makers these days, not the hardworking students. July is a month where most students have to cram all their lessons within this period so as to obtain decent grades at school. But the anxiety within students mounts when teachers take their own cool time marking question papers. Most often in the recent past, students have had to wait in suspense till the results were released to them only after the school holidays. 
This practice will now end with the Education Ministry Secretary Sunil Hetttiarachchi giving instructions to all school principals and provincial education secretaries to ensure that term test results are released to students before they begin their school holidays. 
What has prompted the Education Ministry Secretary to take such action are the several complaints received regarding the delay in releasing term test results. 
This move by Hettiarachchi must be commended because in the recent past teachers have had time to engage in protests and take time off work. There are schools where some teachers are noticeably absent on quite a number of days during the year. As a result teachers have had difficulties in covering the syllabuses; an act which puts the poor students under undue pressure. 
Teachers mustnt forget the fact that their chargers are children and there is a limit to the pressures they can take. Apart from this, children also feel the heat when their parents demand good grades from them. Often these delays in releasing term test results choke students and their parents, largely because the latter cant then assess the performances of children. Parents are spending lavishly on their childrens education and have a right to know the exam results of their children at the earliest. 
According to Ceylon Teachers Union Secretary Joseph Stalin as many as 300,000 principals and teachers were expected to launch an island-wide strike action on July 26 (Thursday) in protest against 1014 questionable reappointments in the teaching profession. However, thanks to President Maithripala Sirisena, a discussion he had with union leaders had compelled these teachers to call off the strike temporarily. It is said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had also spoken to the President with regard to the grievances of the teachers. Just imagine the plight of students if such a large number of teachers took time off their busy schedules at their respective schools. 
It is also apt to mention here the attitude of some teachers who are a terror at school. But strangely students find these teachers to be quite nice and approachable when they attend their private tuition classes. These teachers are quite content teaching the bright ones at school, the workplace that pays them their salaries. If these teachers have time for weak students its only at their private tuition classes where parents have to spend through their noses to pay the monthly fees! 
Teachers are powerful. Some are extremely powerful. These teachers unions have given them bargaining power. Characteristics like love and care which were largely associated with teachers have been now replaced by new features like power and ambition. 
In the past teachers were humble and humane and loved it when students, who were driven by ambition, came to them. Most of these students were bright and the teachers went out of their way to educate them about the importance of being selfless and responsible citizens. Now it seems that the present lot of teachers must be taught these important characteristics. 
Teaching at present seems to be a profession where one takes a lot and gives a little. However there is still a sizable percentage of teachers who are committed to this noble profession and regard the students as children of their own. Some of these teachers might also be members of teachers unions. Its interesting to see whether these teachers, who can set an example to the others, will hold their heads high during these disruptive times in the education sector.
