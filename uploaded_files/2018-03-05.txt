Breaking down barriers ? Pressing for Progress
	
?If I didn?t define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people?s fantasies for me and eaten alive??
- Audre Lorde
Living in a male-dominated world, millions of women around the globe face challenges in every aspect of their lives. Our societies are structured in a way that men are privileged and reap much of the benefits in society for merely being a man; it has been this way for thousands of years. Society treats men and women differently from the point of assigning them pink or blue and holds boys and girls to very different expectations.
From the point of handing a girl a baby doll to play with they are expected to be nurturing, selfless, obedient and respectful of men and to aspire to marriage and starting a family. Men, on the other hand, are expected to showcase leadership, strength, and an aspiration to lead a successful career life. Young girls must battle through these expectations and ideas that they are bombarded with by parents, peers, school environment and the media.
As girls grow up they are not taught about sexuality or allowed to express their desires freely; women?s sexuality has been taken away from them. In a society where women and men have to conform to rigid gender roles like in Sri Lanka, anything that attempts to deviate from the norm faces a severe backlash. In this setup lesbian and bisexual women threaten the status quo.
Due to this in many parts of the world lesbian and bisexual women face oppression and harassment based on their sexual orientation and gender expression. However, through adversity, many lesbian and bisexual women have broken barriers in their respective fields pressing for progress. Women like Josephine Baker, Margaret Mead, Audre Lorde, Gertrude Stein, J?hanna Sigur?ard?ttir, Ellen De Generes, Martina Navratilova, Elizabeth Jean Barker, Baroness Barker, Urvashi Vaid, Nicola Adams, and Rachel Maddow have shown us that these challenges are not impossible to overcome.
These women have paved the road for future generations of women to express and love themselves and break through society?s limitations to channel their highest potential.? They too, have at one time faced the same barriers we face here in Sri Lanka, and I have used them as examples here rather than anyone from Sri Lanka, for obvious reasons.

"Nicola Adams, a professional boxer and double Olympic Champion, is openly bisexual and has been breaking down barriers for black, bisexual and lesbian women all around the world. She is the first open LGBT competitor to win an Olympic Gold Medal in boxing"
Audre Lorde lived in a time of racial tensions and gave a voice to issues of human sexuality, race, and gender. Audre received a master?s degree from Columbia University and worked as a librarian for most of her life. In 1968, she published her first poem, and it contained a piece called ?Martha?, where she addressed sexuality, to the surprise of her audience. Her life took a major turn as she explored the struggles of being a black, lesbian mother and was even received the American Book Award for ?A burst of light?. Audre battled cancer for several years, and although she lost to cancer, she is remembered as a great poet and warrior for the unheard voices of women.
Born and raised in Louisiana this young and charismatic comedian is known for coming out about her sexual orientation on the Oprah Winfrey Show. Ellen De Generes through her career has broken down barriers and entered people?s home as a household name, loved by both young and adults alike. She became the first gay or lesbian person to host the ?Academy Awards? when she was appointed to host the ?79th Academy Awards? in 2007.
In 2014 she ranked at number 46 in the Forbes ?Most Powerful Women in the World? list.
Growing up in a conservative Catholic community didn?t stop Rachel Maddow from breaking through the obstacles placed for her. An outgoing, athletic, and confident young woman, she became the first openly gay or lesbian person to host a primetime news programme in the US.
Her show ?The Rachel Maddow Show? became the highest rated show on the channel, and she has received multiple awards for her accomplishments as a political commentator and television host.
Nicola Adams, a professional boxer and double Olympic Champion, is openly bisexual and has been breaking down barriers for black, bisexual and lesbian women all around the world. She is the first open LGBT competitor to win an Olympic Gold Medal in boxing. Having to face financial hardships and discrimination for being a woman in a male-dominated sport at an early age, gave her the strength she needed to persevere against all the odds.
In recognition of Lesbians making strides in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, I must highlight those such as Josephine Baker, Sonja Kovalevsky, and Margaret Mead. I must also mention more contemporarily Dr. Danelle Tanner, Nergis Mavalvala, Dr Amy A. Ross, and Dr Donna Riley who have been honoured by the National Organization of Gay and Lesbian Scientists and Technical Professionals over the past decade. Notably, Dr. Tanner?s work spans multiple fields: microelectronics, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), capacitors, and nuclear weapon components. She is also an advocate for pay and benefits equity in her labs. Dr. Ross for 30 years has been an advocate and mentor for enrolling more LGBT students in the fields of science and technology.
Even though women?s issues have been in discussions more so than ever, much change is yet to be achieved. Some of these are harder to fight just because they are woven under the pretence of culture and are often difficult to confront. Women still face barriers in being autonomous about their sexual health and reproductive rights, marriage rights, issues in their workplace with unequal wages or not been hired outside of stereotypical gender roles. Women?s perspectives and ideas are often undervalued and under represented in governance, where women?s rights are often decided by men. It?s time we nurtured our young girls to aspire outside of the pre-existing frames.

DPA, 04th FEBRUARY, 2018
The British government on Sunday said it plans to extend licensed pub opening hours by two hours over the weekend of May 19, the day Prince Harry marries his American fiancee Meghan Markle.

The English Football Association cup final also takes place on May 19, with many people expected to watch the match in pubs.
Prince William, Prince Harry?s older brother and widely expected to be his best man, is the president of the FA and would normally present the trophy. Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36, announced plans last week to invite hundreds of members of the public to view their wedding at Windsor Castle from inside the royal residence. The couple ?want their wedding day to be shaped so as to allow members of the public to feel part of the celebrations too,? Kensington Palace said.

Former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa today said everyone should act with responsibility to maintain law and order in Digana and said both the President and the Prime Minister should take action in this regard.
Mr. Rajapaksa expressed these views in response to questions by journalists outside the Sri Sambodhi Viharaya in Colombo.
The former president arrived at the temple to pay his last respects to Ven. Daranagama Kusaladhamma Thera who passed away recently.
Mr. Rajapaksa said the demise of Ven. Kusaladhamma Thera and Ven. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera created a great void in the country and the Buddha sasana.
When asked about his opinion on the Digana incident where a tense situation prevailed yesterday, he said everyone should use their brains and act responsibly to maintain law and order.
?According to reports I received, police action had aggravated the situation when they took into custody a vehicle that came to a funeral. I?m not saying this is exactly what has happened. There are different versions of the story,? he said.

Govt. condemns acts of violence
	
The Government strongly and unequivocally condemns the recent sporadic incident of violence that had sparked off in Ampara and Digana, creating communal disharmony, where some places of worship, residences and businesses have been damaged, the Government Information Department said in a statement this evening.
It also said;
"The Government also condemned the hate and mischievous targeting the Muslim community in particular and another as well, with the clear objective of creating among communities and inciting violence.
The Government urges every citizen of Sri Lanka to desist from falling prey to such hate and misinformation campaigns. As a country that had suffered by acts of violence for nearly three decades, we as a nation should desist from the repetition of such.
At the National Security Council Meeting held yesterday, the President has ordered the Security Forces and the police to enforce the Law and Order and to take immediate action to counter any acts of violence affecting any community, in liaison with the Government Agents/Divisional Secretaries and District Administrative Authorities. Already they are working in unity to ensure the full and impartial enforcement of the law to protest all communities against any attack that create communal/ religious disharmony.
The government will not hesitate to take firm and stern action against perpetrators of crimes and violate law and order. The Government urged for total co-operation from all citizens irrespective of any communal, religious differences to build a Nation that is stable, peaceful and the progressive where diversity is respected; and, where every individual has the opportunity to enjoy all freedom that are the rights of equal citizenship. Every Sri Lankan citizen inclusive of the clergy, politicians, social leaders, civil societies and media must deplore and violence and must co-operate to bring peace and harmony to achieve reconciliation"

The government has contrasting ways of dealing with public demonstrations in the Northern Province and the other parts of the country, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Head Prof. G.L. Peiris said today.
Addressing a news briefing, he asked as to why the government was silent on the protest in Mullaitivu where some people motivated by TNA were demanding 600 acres of land at Wattuwakal be distributed among original owners.
However, he said the Police had different ways of dealing with the group of farmers in Thambuttegama who were mercilessly beaten during their agitation of using water from the Rajanganaya Tank for a water supply project.
?The government should have considered the couple of issues equally and taken steps accordingly. These types of behaviours of the government would trigger racial issues which would vastly affect the country?s security apparatus,? he said.
Meanwhile, he said that the SLFP members who are affiliated to the Unity Government are reluctant to vote in favour of the proposed No- Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

GSLF wants Dr.Nimalka Fenando removed from OMP
	
The Global Sri Lankan Forum (GSLF) yesterday vehemently condemned the appointment of Dr. Nimalka Fernando as one of the Commissioners to the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) and requested the President to remove her from the OMP.
In a statement addressed to President Maithripala Sirisena, it said they condemned the appointment of Dr. Fernando on behalf of all Sri Lankan patriots living across the world.
"In order to preserve the dignity of the country, we request the President to conduct a proper investigation and to remove people like Dr. Fernando whose actions had only brought disrepute to the Sri Lankan Government,? it said.
The GSLF said soon after the war was ended in 2009, one of the biggest challenges faced by the country was responding to the false allegations made by many elements including the UN Human Rights High Commissioner?s Office.
"When we were facing such a situation, Dr.Nimalka Fernando made numerous statements against the country and war heroes at several UNHRC sessions. Therefore, we perceive her appointment as an attempt of placing the national security at risk and betraying the war heroes," The GSLF said in its statement
"It also seems the President has failed to realise that not only a fight has to be waged against the terrorists but also against the unwise decisions taken by certain elements in the government who back terrorism,? it said.??(Lahiru Pothmulla)

Indian docs hold mobile clinics in NE: GMOA
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said today that several Indian medical officers who had visited the country for the ?Medicare Health Exhibition? had conducted mobile clinics in Northern and Eastern provincies risking the lives of patients.
GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge said the Indian medical officers had not obtained the necessary permission from the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to conduct mobile clinics in those provinces.
?The Ministry of Health had facilitated their arrival and conduct medical campaigns within the country,? he said.
Dr. Aluthge said in 2012 a patient?s life was placed in danger following a heart surgery performed by an unqualified Indian medical specialist in a private hospital.
?The patient was rescued by medical officers of the National Hospital in Colombo,? he said and added that though the country had not signed the Economic and Technology Co-operation Agreement (ETCA), parts of it were seen to function in several other ways posing a threat to lives of patients.
Dr. Aluthge said during the tenure of former the president the GMOA requested the then Health Minister Maithripala Sirisena to adopt a regulatory mechanism to check the qualifications of the foreign medical officers arriving the country.
?However, the Health Ministry had yet failed to do so,? he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Vladimir Putin has claimed there is still no hard evidence that Russian nationals interfered in the 2016 presidential election and that everything put forward so far, including the indictment against 13 of them, amounts to ?yelling and hollering?.? ?

?I have to see first what they?ve done. Give us materials, give us information,? he said.? ?

?Thousands of civilians have fled advances by Syrian government forces in eastern Ghouta over the last two days, a war monitor and a resident said on Sunday, as Damascus wages an offensive to crush the last major rebel enclave near the capital.
A commander in the military alliance that backs President Bashar al-Assad said government forces needed to advance just a few more kilometres (miles) into the enclave to split it in two.
A U.N. humanitarian official said 400,000 people in eastern Ghouta were being subjected to unacceptable?collective punishment?, and called for the implementation of a 30-day ceasefire demanded by the U.N. Security Council.
With the war entering its eighth year, capturing the eastern Ghouta area would be a major victory for Assad, who has steadily recovered control of rebellious areas with military support from Russia and Iran.

Panditharatne, Chair, Mahaveli Authority, at the beginning stages.??
He drove the jeep all the way from Colombo and back and we met the people because we were at the initial stages of the project, to explain the situation. We met them in the school hall. Communication was easy.
We now hear, from the TV that the recent riot at Rajangane was caused by an agent provocateur, who had stimulated the highly politicised audience of colonists and dependants by telling them the half-truth about a water processing project.??
We all know and the people of Rajarata know the immense damage done to the health of the farmers in the NCP dry zone by use of a weedicide.?
This has been the subject of much bitter debate for years and since this kind of problem is well known internationally a scientific process called ?reverse osmosis? has been employed to process water for drinking in similar situations in other countries.? ?
I was in an audience at the Independent Medical Practitioners Association (IMPA) Colombo, where a person from Singapore demonstrated it on stage. That was for an English educated middle-class audience of professionals. The procedure is well described in books and on the internet.??
In Colombo very, very few wanted to buy the gadget for home use, because Colombo water is okay. However, it is a well known and used process for water purification worldwide. An audience which knows only Sinhala or Tamil will not catch on to it easily, as laymen.?
Apparently, the protagonists of the project had not communicated its meaning to the colonist beneficiaries and it was easy to distort its significance. That is how the Bandaranaikes and the SLFP presented Sinhala only for the entire population, except the family which was sent abroad for study.??
As recently as 1987, when at the insistence of Rajiv Gandhi, English was brought in as a language to establish commonality, Dr Colvin R de Silva, was alleged to have persuaded President J.R.
?
"Clearly, it was so easy to persuade the Rajangane farmers about the evil intentions of the ?reverse osmosis? process because accessing that kind of knowledge from an available, public source is not possible in Sinhala.? "
?
?
Jayewardene, to change the description of English from ?national language? to ?link language? thereby placing English in limbo with no status of its own, in the Constitutional Amendment of 1987.? ?
It is only a link. English has immense intrinsic value, much more than Sinhala or Tamil and would have played a transforming role like in India if it had been included as a national language. But did Dr Colvin R de Silva, the famous author of ?Ceylon under the British,? a text which we admired for its use of English in the doctoral thesis at the University of London want us to study in English??
I bring in this background to apply it to the Rajangane situation. Clearly, it was so easy to persuade the Rajangane farmers about the evil intentions of the ?reverse osmosis? process because accessing that kind of knowledge from an available, public source is not possible in Sinhala.??
I don?t know about Tamil. This event throws light on an unusual and very significant experience I had in 1988, as National Coordinator for English.? In 1987, I ran an island-wide English course for students who had gained admission but had not yet stepped into the universities. We had 6,000 students, in 100 teaching centres (Government schools, after school hours) from KKS to Dondra, with 300 odd teachers from the neighbouring schools.??
The target was the General English Paper for the A Level. It was superbly orchestrated by consultants and books donated from the West. There was an end of programme evaluation test and I inserted one personal question:??
?Will you sit for the A-Level General English Paper now that you have been prepared???
The answer was:??
?No! We want to be educated in the English medium in the University.? ?
I leave the reader to come to his own conclusions. Does this have any bearing on the Rajangane episode?-The writer is an ex SLAS officer, PhD English (USA) PG Dip Econ (Oxford) BA (Ceylon)

Trump escalates trade war, threatens European carmakers
	
?
In his expanding war over global trade, President Donald Trump has aimed his harshest rhetoric at an unlikely target - the closest U.S. allies.? ?
In Twitter posts while at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Saturday, Trump vowed to strike back at European leaders who said they would retaliate for his promised tariffs on aluminum and steel.? ?
Bring it on, Trump warned.? ?
?If the EU wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!? he tweeted.? ?
Instead, the biggest burden of Trump?s new tariffs would be borne by Canada, the largest trading partner with the United States. The United States runs a trade surplus with Canada? ??The president is going to quickly find out that you can?t start a trade war with your allies and expect them to work with you on other issues,? said Jamie Fly, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. ?The administration is squandering the little credibility they had with transatlantic partners at a time when they?re asking them to help fix the Iran deal, fight terrorism and increase defence spending. It will not work.???

UNP to re-nominate SF for Law and Order
	
The United National Party (UNP) has reportedly decided to re-nominate Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka as Law and Order Minister, it is learnt.
When the UNP nominated him to the post the first time it was turned down by President Maithripala Sirisena. Thereafter, the UNP sought to assign the subject to another member of the party but no one was ready to accept it.
Against this backdrop, the party had taken a decision to re-submit his name to the President. Already, SLFP ministers had been against appointing Mr. Fonseka to this post a sentiment shared by many senior police officers.(Kelum Bandara)
