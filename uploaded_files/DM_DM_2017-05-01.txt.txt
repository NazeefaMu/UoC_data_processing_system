An upgraded Colombo City -- To benefit the genuine working class: JHU
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today its May Day rally would focus on the plight of the real working class including pavement hawkers, cleaners and porters.
It said the rally would be a turning point in Sri Lanka's history at a time when most political parties were celebrating May Day to showcase their political strength rather than highlighting the concerns of the workers.
JHU General Secretary and Minister, Patali Champika Ranawaka said even though Colombo and its suburbs were beautified, the lives of the workers in Pettah and Fort had remained unchanged since British times.
He said little or nothing had been done to improve the living standards of the workers in Fort and Pettah even though they had participated in May Day rallies organized by political parties for political gain.
The minister said the JHU would distribute insurance policies to 1,500 families living in Fort and Pettah so as to secure their future.
He said strikes launched by instigating the people working in the Port, the Railway Department and tea estates had resulted in a drawback for the country and added that the Colombo Port which was ranked fifth in the world had now fallen way down the list.
We want to raise the standards of the Colombo Port to be one of the best in the world. We will develop the Port City so that your children can work as ship engineers and captains. There will be no strikes in the Port City and will provide an opening for your children to live better lives, the minister said. He said plans were afoot to relocate the Manning Market in Peliyagoda and the premises to be developed into a transport hub with access to buses, taxis, trains and trams.
We build a Business Centre in Pettah for the betterment of your children. We will put a stop to drug trafficking and underworld activities," the minister said. Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana, JHU national organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe also addressed the rally. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Appointment of SF to top post a joke blown out of proportion: Harrison
	
Minister of Rural Economy P. Harrison said that the media had blown a statement made by the President Maithripala Sirisena regarding the assignment of Minister Sarath Fonseka to a top post out of proportion, but it was a mere joke cracked at the Cabinet meeting held last Tuesday (25).
The minister said this at a workshop held at Galpokuna estate in Kuliyapitiya that he participated in where a delegation of specialists from the Netherlands were also present.
He said said this when questioned by the media about a remark by the President with regards to the new post given to Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka.Not at all. It was manipulated by the media. This was a question the President posed to FM Sarath Fonseka as a joke. This has been misconstrued by the media as a return to the Gotabhaya era where fear and terror is spread within a military-style government. That will never happen.
Expressing his views on the May Day rally to be conducted by the UNP he said they would hold the biggest, best attended May Day rally ever held in the history of the country.
It is not an easy task to fill the Galle Race Green with the people. This time the joint opposition have a tough task ahead of them. MP Bandula Gunawardena announced that they would bring 2 million people to their rally. This time their nakedness will be there for all to see. After May Day several persons will again run to the President.
The minister said further that as a mature party like the SLFP knows how to commemorate May Day without the support of others as they possess sufficient experience in this regard.(Dinesh Upendra)

Challenge fulfilled successfully: MR
	
The challenge of filling up the Galle Face Green with Joint Opposition (JO) supporters was fulfilled successfully and now the government should hold the elections for the local government (LG) bodies without a delay to test peoples franchise, former president and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa challenged today.
Addressing the large crowd that thronged the Galle Face green for the May Day Rally organised by the JO, the former President said the government was trembling and shaking after witnessing the crowd gathered at JO rallies.
We accepted the challenge and fulfilled it. Now, its only fair that we challenge the government. We challenge them to hold the elections for LG bodies immediately. However, after seeing this crowd, it will never go for any election, he said.
If the government still continues to postpone the elections, the JO would have to show the power of the people by even taking to the streets, he said.
While claiming that they have accepted challenges of more magnitude, Mr. Rajapaksa said their My Day rally was historic and it would decide the end of the government.
He said the JO would do whats necessary in the event the government introduces a Constitution which divides the country. We shouldnt wait till it does this. As Wimal Weerawansa and Vasudeva Nanayakkara said, people will take it to the streets. Thats when we will teach a lesson to this separatist government, he said.
He criticized the government of dragging the construction of the Colombo Port City now known as Colombo International Financial City (CIFC), handing over operations of the Trincomalee Harbour to India and alienation.
He went on to note that the people are suffering from the loans obtained by the government and the Central Bank Bond sale issue and not because of the loans obtained during the previous regime.
Meanwhile, he said though Sri Lanka hadnt become a signatory of the Rome Statute, members of the tri-forces and hierarchy of the commanders could be tried at an international war crime tribunal because of a recent Bill approved by the Government.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena had crippled the country and had removed functional electoral organizers of the Sri Lanka Freedom party (SLFP) on the whims of Sirikotha.
This May Day rally is not only about trade union action. This should be used as a platform to send this government home, he said.
Addressing the event, MP Wimal Weerawansa said the people gathered at the rally would surround Temple Trees and the Presidents House if the government brought in a separatist constitution.
He said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to Sri Lanka during the Vesak festival would not be in favour of the country and therefore, requested people to hoist black flags in protest over his visit and handing over of Trincomalee port to India.
He also said the people cannot wait till 2020 general election and said peoples force is the one and only option to go for in order to request for an early election.
MPs Dinesh Gunawardane, Dullas Alahapperuma, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Sarath Weerasekara, Gamini Lokuge, Dilum Amunugama, Udaya Gammanpila, former Ministers G.L. Peiris, Tissa Vitharana and many others spoke at the May Day rally. Except for one MP, who is abroad, all MPs of the Joint Opposition were attended the rally. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Commemoration day of workers May Day belongs to workers, not to lotus eaters
	
In the words of Ernest Barker individualism so conceived starts, indeed, from individual personality and from the inherent title of each individual person to enjoy the conditions necessary to the development of his capacities. However, just because the development of individual capacities starts on that basis one cannot develop his capacities fully without the assistance and the cooperation of others. He must be surrounded with service, a collective service which in union with others, he himself helps to provide for others as well as for himself, a service which becomes all the greater, the more fully the conditions necessary for his development is recognized and the more his rights are thereby extended. 
Un-served and unattended individual 
Thus he should not be un-served or unattended. It should be a whole system of collective service which the individuality needs for development. During the period of feudalism individuals were unaided, disregarded and ill advised and individual workers were not cooperative. Hence, they often failed to get their needs and wants satisfied. Individuals realized that fact. They joined hands and worked together and achieved better results. 
Collectivity and collective bargain 
Therefore for the perfection of individual personality and capacity individuals need the assistance and co-operation of others. Individuals with similar interests get together and form into unions for mutual assistance and cooperation. This consolidation provides them strength, strength for the achievement of their wants and needs. All of them are benefited by power and strength exchanged among them. A number of sticks bound together are stronger than a single one. Likewise, individuals who get together and work together, help one another and share the available resources to gain momentum to face the challenges successfully. Workers who could not get their needs and wants satisfied as they wished by remaining as individuals realized the virtues of collectivity, cooperation and solidarity extended their friendly hands to the others who were in the same boat. They realized that their talents differed. This gave rise to the theories off division of labour and specialization. They expected recognition, better remuneration, better working conditions and other comforts. To achieve them they used collectivity as a weapon. They used the bargaining power and agitated collectively for the perfection of needs and wants individually as well as wholly. They formed trade unions. They were functioning well until politics interfered to divert the workers to a wrong direction. 
How May Day came into being 
On May 1, 1886, trade unions throughout the USA went on a strike demonstrating that the standard work day be shortened to eight hours. While socialists believed that all the people were equal anarchists believed that the government and the law should over rule the workers. There was a clash between the stand of the workers and that of the rulers and the workers went on strike in organized labour movements. The climax was the incident in Chicago Hay market where in the course of the riot on May 4th an anarchist threw a bomb causing the death of a number of persons, including police officers and injuring more than 100 people. 
Eight-hour working days
These protests did not bring immediate results but the working class went on with their protests demanding eight hour working days and eventually it has become a norm. The men who were arrested after the Hay Market riot of 1886 in Chicago Illinois, on May 4 were executed. In communication of this execution, May Day is called the International Workers Day or the Labour Day. Consequently this May Day became established as an anarchists holiday and in this form May Day has become an International celebration of social and economic achievements of the working class and a labour movement. 
Loyalty Day 
Although May Day observances began in the USA it was not officially or popularly recognized as a holiday there. May 1 was officially designated by the UN Congress as a Loyalty Day in 1958 because of the association of May Day with Communism. 
The Paris Workers Congress held in Paris on 14-20 July 1889, the most notable decision was to call on all workers to celebrate May 1st each year as the International Festival of the working class. 
Labour leaders, socialists and archaists around the world have taken the American strikes and their fall out as a rallying point choosing May Day as a day for demonstrations, parades, meetings and speeches. It was a major state holiday in the Soviet Union (USSR) and other Communist countries consequent to the incident in Chicago. 
May Day Celebrations in various countries and attempts to undermine
May Day is celebrated in most of the countries world over as the day of the working class. Meanwhile various authorities have tried to ban or undermine May Day, particularly the Communist observances during the cold war or hostilities among nations without actual fighting. In 1958 President Eisenhower designated May 1st as both Law Day and the Loyalty Day. In many countries including Sri Lanka, May day is celebrated not solely for the benefit of the working class but for other purposes such as gaining political ends. 
Flora festival
Flora festivals are also held during this period to mark the beginning of summer. Flora is the Roman goddess of fruits and flowers. Summer is the period when fruits and flowers are available in abundance. Hence May Day is celebrated in the name of goddess Flora from April 28 to May 3. 
May poles and treesof liberty at MayDay festival 
In the past, trees were the symbols of vitality and fertility of nature and were used at the spring festival. The May Tree has since become the Tree of Liberty. This was the symbol of the French Revolution. As a part of the May Day celebrations the youth in old Europe cut down trees lopped off the branches, leaving a few at the top of each tree. They wrapped the trees round with violets like figure of Attics, the Ancient Roman God. At Sunrise they took the trees to their villages blowing horns and flutes. This was done to symbolize the processing god Attics to the temple Cybil on Rome Palestine Hill during the spring festival of March 22. By the middle ages, every English village had its own May Pole. It was a competition among villagers to produce the largest May Pole 
May Poles constructed for May Day
In small towns and villages, May Poles were constructed only for the May Day. However, in large cities including London permanent May poles were erected. When Puritans came into power in 1644 the tradition of erecting May poles came to an end. However, the Stuarts captured power within a couple of decades and the reintroduced the tradition. 
May Day celebrations in honour of St. Walberg
Another objective in celebrating May Day is to honour the Abbess of the monastery of Heedenhelm, St. Walberg who had helped St. Boniface bring Christianity to Germany during the 8th century. 
May Day and Pagan Festival 
May Day also had a coincidence with a Pagan festival which included rites to protect one against witchcraft. It was believed that witches met with the devil in the evening of May 1. It was believed that May Day celebrations had been conducted to avoid the ill effects of witchcraft. 
Celebrations tomark May Day
In the past, in some countries, May Day celebrations began at the Sun set of April 30th. Celebrations included floral decorations in the houses at night on the April 30th followed by processions in towns and villages on the May Day. Celebrations included floral decorations in the houses at night on April 30 followed by processions in towns and villages on May Day. 
May Day celebrationsat sunrise
In some Western countries, children including those in the primary school participate in May Day festivals. Children start with a special May Day song followed by a procession to the church. All the children wear white garments and carry garlands of flowers. All girls wear straw hats and ribbons in their hair. 
House decorationson May Day 
In some parts of the globe, people get up early in the morning on May Day and go out to collect flowers and greenery and decorate their houses. They believe that the spirit of vegetation will bring good fortune. Girls wash their faces in the dew of the early morning. They believe that this would make them beautiful and remain same during the whole year. They attend to various festivities during the rest of the day. They dance in the village green. They also engage in archery contests and exhibit their strength. 
May Day queen 
The main item of the day is the crowning the May Day Queen. The model of the May Day Queen is made of flowers or a beautiful girl is selected for the crown. In the past it did not take part in games or dancing but sat on a chair decked with flowers and watched the performances of others. The tradition is followed even at present.

Golden opportunity to grab power: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today that it had got a golden opportunity to seize power due to the political vacuum created in the country with the deterioration of the three main political camps of President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake addressing its May Day Rally held at the BRC grounds in Colombo said that it would come as a broad peoples force to fill the political vacuum created in the country as the only force which could do that.
The Rajapaksa camp is not a flourishing camp as its power is dependent on Mahinda Rajapaksa and its ideology of obtaining power quickly. They do not have constructive political slogans. They cannot ask for power to develop the economy, ensure democracy, establish good foreign policy or ensure national harmony. They can only say that the LTTE raising its head. But as long as the JVP is in active politics, we would not allow any ethnic conflict in the country, he said.
President Maithripala Sirisenas political future is also uncertain as SLFPers are not with him as he divided the party by joining with the UNP. Even though he is the leader of the party, he is not the leader of the SLFP members.
Ranil Wickremesinghe also does not have a stable political future as he is not a leader elected by the people but he was a by-product of the 2015 election held between the pro-Mahinda and anti-Mahinda campaign. When people wanted to arrest fraudsters, Ranil was engaged in frauds, he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said the JVP would capitalize on this political vacuum to bring in a peoples governance in the country and added that for the last 70 years the governance was not for the people but for the rulers and their henchmen.
He said during the 70-year ruling by the UNP and the SLFP, the country had not gone forward but plunged downward and added that the people had become poverty-ridden with lack of proper education and health facilities.
He said the government only gave Rs. 100,000 to the Meethotamulla victims as compensation while they spent billions of rupees to purchase vehicles for politicians.
Mr. Dissanayake said it would not allow the government to destroy the country anymore and added that they fight for the rights of the people.

Road parallel to Dalada Maligawa closed to preserve serenity of Maha Maluwa Even the colonial rulers
	
The Ven. Mahanayakes have opposed the opening of a road that is running parallel to the Sri Dalada Maligawa, so is Minister Lakshman Kiriella who has said so at a recent meeting that while this government is in power, the road across the Sri Dalada Maligawa would not be opened. President Maithripala Sirisena at a Development meeting held at the Janadipathi Mandiraya in 2016 also spoke in favour of the subject.
The present coterie of people who have been stirring up for the opening of the road comes with the pledges given by politicians during the last general elections; they would have thought it would be easy to open a road that was closed by the two Mahnayakes some years ago, namely Mahanayake of Asgiri Ven. Panditha Sirimalwatte Ananda Thera and the firebrand Mahanayaka Ven. Palipanne Chandananda Thera and societies and traders of Kandy. 
This road is a property of the Sri Dalada Maligawa was constructed by the British when they unveiled the Sir Henry Ward Statue. Not only this road, but the road leading to the present Janadipahti Mandiriaya, when it was Kings Palace. The fact remains that the first survey was done under the command of the British, K.L.Keppetipola did not demarcate a road on the land Maha Maluwa after March 2, 1815. 
A drawing shows Maha Maluwa without a road
Soon after the British annexed the Kandyan Kingdom in the name of Prince Regent at that time. Kandy belonged to the King, not to the people. If they had taken living within the territory, it was at the mercy of the King. That was why most of the deeds were marked as Crown land when the imperialists sold them to the inhabitants. 
The city had been divided into two segments; inner city and outer city. No one was permitted to live within the inner city without the Kings consent, moreover for the inhabitants of the 18 residences of the nobility. With the Kandyan Kingdom ceding to the British, all property and lands had been automatically vested in the British administration. But the British considered that the Sri Dalada Maligawa did not belong to the Kings Treasury and therefore, left it in the hands of the Maha Sangha. 
Governor General Sir Robert Brownrigg vested the land in front of the Pathiruppuwa or Octogon on March 10, 1815 in the Sri Dalada Maligawa. Dr. Vimalananda Tennakoon relates the March 10 incident as a historic function. Governor Brownrigg, with no lesser significance and political importance than the ceremony which took place at the Audience Hall on March 2. He gave abundant evidence of the solemnity, gravity, dignity and political importance which spoke of the religious ceremony in which he actively participated. The function was attended by the the Mahanyake Theras of Malwatte and Asgiriya. Sir James Sunderland, the Chief Secretary for Kandyan Affairs, Sir John DOyly the British Resident General and a vast assembly of people gathered at the Maha Maluwa. The British band played music, throughout the conference. In order to mark the occasion, the British Government gifted the Octogen and the Maha Maluwa to the Dalada Malgawa and it was accepted by the Maha Sangha. This has been reported by Dr.Tennakoon from the research papers from the Archives in London, of which the original document had been perused by him.It confirmed that Governor Brownrigg gifted the Octogen and Maha Maluwa to the Sangha. 
Author A.M.Hocart recorded that In 1817, there had been a a rebellion and the Tooth Relic was removed by a rebel party. After the recovery of the Sacred Relic, the British deployed an armed guard, thereby the military occupied a section of the Maligawa. So it became the property of the Army. Because of the rebellion the British soldiers took over and continued to be the custodians of the property. All were clearly recorded by Dr.Tennakoon and also by the British writers at that time. The relics were exposed to the public by order of the Governor who himself attended an exposition in 1828. The Sacred Tooth Relic was exhibited at the Maha Maluwa for 14 days at the Governors request, which created the famous Dalada Watura.

The Maha Maluwa was extended up to Queens Hotel and there was no road in between according to the paintings and maps drawn by the British Army. The Colonial Secretarys office on August 3,1891 writes, The War department acting on the recommendations of the Boundary Commission of 1854, had abandoned all reserves or other rights over the portion from Castle Hill Street - not hitherto surrendered to the government and the Esplanade on the Lakeside between Queens Hotel and the Dalada Maligawa within the Kandy Municipal Council (KMC) limits. He adds that he was directed by the Governor to hand over the sites in question to the Municipality for the purpose of Conservancy. On the condition that no buildings should be constructed by them without the permission of the government. But there was no vesting order by the Government to the KMC. Castle Hill street is the present Kotugodelle Veediya and the Esplanade is Maha Maluwa.
In a photograph taken in 1828 (which was later reproduced), which is still displayed at the National Museum it exposes the Sacred Relic at Maha Maluwa. There was no road in between those lands which led to the Queens Hotel and beyond. In 1819, the KMC, for no specific reasons, requested the Government to hand over the Maha Maluwa and the War Department did so with the specific term For the purpose of Conservancy. The KMC continued as a Preserver. However, one Councillor, Late Upatissa Ratnayake put it as a Destroyer. 
Then, the Councillors wanted the Maha Maluwa to be made as a Pleasure Garden, not knowing that Maha Maluwa was a Sacred plot of land. When the so-called second Sacred Tooth Relic of Buddha from China was exposed to the public, and it was at the Maha Maluwa. That exposition was done on the road which is now canvassed to be opened by some who do not know the history of Kandy nor that the Citadel of the Buddhist World stands at the end of Maha Maluwa and the Kandy Lake. 
A number of Kandy residents, including Lawyers petitioned to the KMC. According to a Senior Lawyer and member of the KMC Late G.B.de Silva, that no structure of the Maha Maluwa should be altered. Since the then Mayor published that Maha Maluwa was to be converted into Pleasure Garden. But the project Municipal Councillor said it was only an Artists view to give the Maha Maluwa a proper forecourt. 
Also the British had deployed a military guard at the Sri Dalada Maligawa and the Pattiruppuwa. After the military guard had moved away, the first resident of the Kandyan Kingdom Sir John DOyly had made the Pattiruppawa his official Headquarters where the Kings Palace was adjacent to the Sri Dalada Maligawa. Due to unknown reasons, on August 13, 1893 this land was handed over to the KMC for Conservancy, which means to conserve.

But the Boundary Commission which was held in 1884 had abandoned the reserve or other rights over the plot of land from the Sri Dalada Maligawa to the present Queens Hotel, which at that time was a lodging house for the Army personnel. The controversial road that cuts across the Dalada Maligawa is no issue at all, since there was no road in 1815, when the British administration was declared in March that year. The simple answer was the survey done by H.L.Keppetipola in 1815. 
There was only a diagonal footpath across the Maha Maluwa. The road, being a part of that Sacred area was built by the British. They also had built another road towards the present day Janadipathi Mandiraya or the then Kings Pavilion to provide access to the Governor to the Stately Mansion built over the Pilimatalawa Walauwe. This was to provide hassle-free ride to the Governor who visited Kandy from Colombo to spend his leisure at the Kings Pavilion. 
Kandy is situated in a valley, and no doubt the emitted fumes could damage the structure of the Pathiruppawa or Octogen, that had witnessed the 1998 bomb blast and subsequently reconstructed with similar architecture by Prof. Ranaweera of the Peradeniya Universitys Engineering Faculty, when most of them, other than the then Diyawadana Nilame Niranjan Wijeyaratne decided against the Pattippurppuwa been brought down. The vibrations that would be caused by the plying vehicles on this road adjacent to this ancient building could disturb the serenity of the Hallowed Shrine.  
However the road has been closed permanently; except for the Mahanayakas and service monks by former President Mahinda Rajapakse, and it is hoped that the incumbent President too would act accordingly.

SF appointment-- I made my statement responsibly: Rajitha
	
With reference to the controversy that has arisen over the proposal by President Maithripala Sirisena to assign Minister Sarath Fonseka to deal with emergency situations that may occur in the country, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratna said he takes full responsibility for the statement made by him.
He said it was he who was responsible for reporting what transpired at Cabinet meetings to the media as the Cabinet spokesperson. He said he had made the latest remarks with the blessings of the President and Prime Minister.
He was responding to Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister John Seneviratne who said the Cabinet Spokesman had made several irresponsible utterances in this regard.
Dr. Senaratne clarified his position at a media briefing after participating in a business conference conducted by Premier International at the Kingsbury Hotel in Colombo. He said, No one in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) can lie about this manner. I talked about what was discussed by Cabinet. There were Cabinet Ministers present. If they have something to say they must have the backbone to do so. These things should have been discussed at the cabinet meeting. There is a clause in the Right to Information Bill to inform everything that happens in the Cabinet to the media I state everything that happens there as the Cabinet Spokesman
Because of that, the government will not fall into an abyss, nor will the SLFP whose members have their legs on both sides of the divide. There are also those who are trying to join hands with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, he said.

SL tourist dies in Chennai cab accident
	
A Sri Lankan tourist was killed when the cab she was travelling in with her family plunged nearly 20 feet into the RBI subway at Parrys in Chennai on Sunday, the Indian Express reported today.
The police said the driver, Muthishwaran, seemed to have been over speeding and lost control of the vehicle when he rammed on the parapet wall of the subway.
The parapet wall of the half-century-old subway gave way and the car plunged into the middle of the subway, missing the lane for two-wheelers located at a higher elevation in the subway.
Police officers said the car landed a little safely. The family inside was rushed to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, but hospital sources said Shithiki Rithviya (54) had already succumbed to injuries.
Rithviya was visiting Chennai with her sons, Mohammed Ashad Rabat (34) and Mohammed Ajmal (30), and daughter-in-law Jima Nazad Amjal. Police sources quoting the family said they were returning to their hotel at Mannady after shopping at T Nagar.
If this didnt happen on a Sunday, there would have been more casualties, said a police officer, highlighting how busy the subway would be on weekdays. The family had originally planned to leave for Sri Lanka on May 3.

SLFP has proved its commitment to working class: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said the largely attended and successful May Day rally at Gatambe in Kandy has given a boost to the victorious forward march of the SLFP-led leftist progressive forces in the country. He vowed to transform the SLFP into a pure, corrupt-free, progressive and democratic political force that could emerge victorious. He pointed out that the SLFP was burdened with corruption and malpractices and faced electoral defeats in 2015.
You placed your trust in me as the President of the SLFP. The people placed their trust in me as the common candidate at the Presidential Election in 2015.
I did not take the chairmanship of the SLFP by force. The central committee of the party invited me. In the last two years, I succeeded in gradually transforming it to a pure democratic party and I thank the senior leaders who extended support to me in this endeavour.
He said that as the trade union leaders pointed out the working class received many benefits and privileges during the last two years and added that the SLFP is a political party that always listen to the genuine demands of the workers as a party that represents the working class of the this country. The SLFP policy is to strengthen indigenous producers, workers, peasants, fishermen and other sections of the working class, he said.
Today the word labourer is not used. Instead, we call the skilled workers. Today the skilled workforce is an important asset of any developed country, he said. The government is fully aware of the importance of the people who serve the nation with their labour and is fully committed to ensure their welfare, he said.
Emphasizing the need for communal amity and harmony, President Sirisena said We cannot build a peaceful country by suppressing other communities.If somebody thinks about his own community, forgetting the other communities, this country cannot be built as a prosperous and peaceful country. How much of our unique Sri Lankan feeling was beautifully displayed in the 1940s when we fought for independence Our Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim leaders fought against the British rule and won the freedom with unity with each other. But after that they separated for power.
He pointed out that intelligence, knowledge, ability, creativity and skilled workforce needed to develop a country and stated that our country has all these elements which needed to develop a country.
Even though some section of the society blamed that the politicians and the political parties are using the May Day, I believe that the workers and the politicians are not two separate entities,and always the politicians should listen to the voices of the working class.
Today, the Sri Lanka Freedom Partys Youth Front could fulfill its duties and responsibilities in an independent and free environment, he said and added that there are no princes or madams and all are equal.
The Government has declared as a policy to introduce 84 days of maternity leave which is currently given to public servants should also be extended to the private sector as well as female shop employees, the President said.
Minister Dr Sarath Amunugamapresented the Economic Policies of the government at the rally. He said the government is totally committed to protect, preserve, strengthen and sustain local agriculture, strengthen local industries, minimize the import of products that could be locally produced and ensure knowledge based, innovative economy and sustainable development. He thanked President Sirisena for the efforts taken to reduce poverty by declaring 2017 as the Year of Alleviation of Poverty and implementing programmes to ensure every citizen is a stakeholder of the economy by opening new opportunities to all.
Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa presented the Environment Policy and two other policies were presented by Ministers Susil Premajayantha and S B Disanayake. President of the SLFP Youth Organization, Shantha Bandara presented the youth policy. The policy with regard to women was presented by Ms Sumedha Jayasena. All of them were unanimously approved.

A new port will soon be constructed North of the present Colombo Port with Japanese assistance along with several other projects, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
Addressing the United National Party (UNP) May Day Rally at Campbell Park last evening, the Prime Minister said Japan and India would assist Sri Lanka to construct a floating natural gas storage in the sea.
Sri Lanka will go in for a joint venture with India to develop the oil tank farm in Trincomalee. There will be a huge demand for oil in a few years and Sri Lanka will be the main supplier. Sri Lanka will get both storage fees in addition to a huge profit share. Thailand and India will assist in setting up industrial zones in the South, West and the East. This is what we have already begun to do," he said.
Outlining several UNP proposals aimed at enhancing the living standards of the people, the Premier said some 6000 items would be exported to Europe after gaining the GSP+ facility..
The proposals read by Public Administration Minister Ranjith Maduma Bandara included ending of political victimization, empowering and giving women more opportunities to engage in politics, providing employment to graduates and the youth, providing technology know-how to school children and ensuring a 13-year education and providing lands and houses to all citizens.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said the lease period of the Trincomalee oil tanks would be limited to only 20 years. "The opposition is alleging that we are selling the oil tanks when we are only going to lease them out for 20 years" he said.
Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said the coalition government of the UNP and the SLFP would continue beyond 2020.
"We will not allow the Rajapaksas to come into power once again," he said. He said opportunities that are available for development should be made use of at least now unlike in the past where the development was sabotaged.
Health Minister Rajith a Senaratne said all corrupt individuals in the previous government including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should be penalized before next years May Day rally.
Minister Senaratne said the President had decided to appoint Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka for the purpose of probing corruption. Some including Minister John Seneviratne was panicking when this was published. People such as Mr. Seneviratne are the ones living on the fence with one foot with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the other foot with President Maithripala Sirisena, he said.
He also said trade unions and others have taken an upper hand today as both the President and the Prime Minister were too lenient.
Field Marshal Sarath Foneseka, UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim and Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa also addressed the gathering. (Yohan Perera)
