A Man of Heroic Stature
	
In Modern Times he Served the Cause of Promoting the Buddha Dhamma
To understand and appreciate the calibre of Sir Cyril de Zoysa one needs to place him against the historical background of our nation and see how he is a product of the very genes that created our nation. Prince Vijaya of the Lion Race in India arrived in Sri Lanka along with seven hundred warriors, struck a strategic relationship with a local Princess, Kuveni of the Yaksha race, and brought the State of Lanka under his suzerainty.
Historical facts reveal that the Yaksha dynasty was in a state of degeneration for several centuries after the fall of King Ravana, their ancient head of state. By this time their Kingdom of Sireesavastu and that of Lankapura were in a state of deterioration. It was during such a time that the advent of Vijaya and his band of followers took place. Prince Vijaya succeeded in winning over Kuveni, descendant of the royal line of King Ravana and through this liaison succeeded in winning over full control of the state of Lanka.? ?
Meanwhile, the Naga Race had made Kelaniya, lying along the Western sea coast, the chief kingdom, while the Deva Race lived in the middle of the country. Between them there were no open dissensions; yet there was no unity either. For this very reason that the Yaksha, Deva and Naga Races were disunited Prince Vijaya found it opportune to subdue the entire country by capturing the kingdom of the YakshaRace.? ?
After the arrival of Thera Mahinda or Mihindu in Lanka, Emperor Dharmashoka the Great, dispatched to this country his daughter Sanghamitta along with a retinue of Bhikkunis or Buddhist nuns, with a sapling of the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi or the Great Resplendent Bodhi Tree and with a large retinue belonging to eighteen clans of artisans skilled in different arts
Meanwhile again, after the arrival of Princess Bhaddha-kachchanaa of the Sakya Dynasty in Lanka, large numbers of the Sakya Dynasty under the leadership of some of the Princess?s own brothers such as Uruvela, Ramagona, Anuradha, Vijitha, Dheegaayu and Rohana, arrived and settled in Lanka and integrated with the people of the Lion Race. After the arrival of Thera Mahinda or Mihindu in Lanka, Emperor Dharmashoka the Great, dispatched to this country his daughter Sanghamitta along with a retinue of Bhikkunis or Buddhist nuns, with a sapling of the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi or the Great Resplendent Bodhi Tree and with a large retinue belonging to eighteen clans of artisans skilled in different arts.? ?
All these communities, much impressed by the devotion of the great King Devanampiyatissa and the great Mahinda Maha Thera, sought ordination as Buddhist monks. Accordingly, they were all ordained without discrimination. As a result, the Sinha-Deva-Naga tribes ? all gradually joined the ranks of Buddhist monks along with Bodhigupta who accompanied the Sacred Bo sapling and the eighteen clans of skilled artisans.? ?
Thus seven or eight generations later, the people, along with the Lion or Sinha tribe that occupied the throne, had imperceptibly become Buddhists. Moreover, owing to such gradual transformation into being Buddhists there was no cause for friction in living together as a community. In the same token, they all became Sinhalese. Meanwhile, in emulation of Sanghamitta, women of all tribes sought and received ordination. She was Anula Devi who took the lead in this matter. From such time onward, the people of Sri Lanka gradually became the subjects of a Buddhist state.? ?
In terms of these historical facts set out so briefly, it is patently clear that the Sinhala race dedicated its very life for the preservation of the Word of the Budddha. In the same token the religious life of Sir Cyril de Zoysa was one of great success. Sir Cyril born in Southern Sri Lanka following the footsteps of the ancient kings and ministers of state spent his wealth, time and knowledge entirely in the cause of sustaining the Sasana.? ?
Sir Cyril de Zoysa held positions of dignity and responsibility moving right up to that of the President of the Senate and the boundless services rendered by him are a result of the power and strength of the genes of the Sinhala people carried through thousands of years
His religious life was a very special one. Some aspects of this religious life are the Restoration of the Kiri Vehera, the development of the Kalutara Bodhi to become one of the Sacred Places par excellence and the setting up of the Young Men?s Buddhist Association (YMBA) Building Complex. Apart from these, he adopted various measures appropriate for the development and preservation of Homes for Elders, Homes for Children, a Ward exclusively for sick Bhikkus, Buddhist Schools and other such. These should be perceived as some aspects of his intellectual ability. His political life too was a rich one. He served for some years as a member of the Upper House of Parliament viz. the Senate, then as its President and thus as an exemplary politician.? ?
It has to be imperatively asserted that, as stated at the very outset of this piece of writing, Sir Cyril de Zoysa who held positions of dignity and responsibility moving right up to that of the President of the Senate and the boundless services rendered by him are a result of the power and strength of the genes of the Sinhala people carried through thousands of years.? ?

Cabinet appointed committees responsible if the tender is faulty: Kabir
	
It is the cabinet appointed procurement committee and the technical evaluation committee that has to be responsible if there has been any fraud in awarding the tender to purchase gas from Shell Gas, Minister of Public Enterprise Development Kabir Hashim said yesterday.
Minister Hashim told a news briefing yesterday that those who are alleging that there has been a fraud involved in awarding of tenders should file complaints against the cabinet appointed procurement committee and the technical evaluation committee. ?It is against the cabinet appointed procurement committee and the technical evaluation committee one should file complaints. If anyone is going to file a complaint with the Financial Crimes Division (FCID) or with any other institution in it has to be filed against these committees,? the Minister said.
?It was me who submitted a paper to the cabinet to award the tender to Shell. However I did it following the advice of appointed procurement committee and the technical evaluation committee,? he added. He said the two committees have the say in accordance with the tender procedures which is followed by the government currently.
The Minister who referred to the questions raised by the journalists on the issues raised by the Litro Gas directors on the non availability of documents to prove the technical qualifications of Shell said he will take up the issue with the board of directors. ?I have the right only to carry out an investigation on how Litro acted upon the tender and therefore I shall conduct such a probe,? he said.
On the allegation that Oman Trading International Ltd has been subjected to injustice when it comes to awarding of the tender, Mr Hashim said this company has been blacklisted for supplying inferior quality gas to Litro and a there is a complaint with FCID on the matter already. Further the Minister said Oman Trading International Ltd had bid $ 65 per metric ton as transportation fees whereas Shell has quoted $ 58. He mentioned that Oman Trading International Ltd later quoted $ 47 per metric ton when the government decided to go for a spot purchase to avoid a delay. ?Bidding an amount which is less than the originally quoted price by Oman Trading International Ltd was suspicious,? he said at the same time.
The gas purchase tender when into a controversy as it was alleged that the recent price hike was a result of a fraud involved in the awarding of tenders to purchase gas. (Yohan Perera)

Caught in the Winds of War DM discovers war-torn long-lost twins
	
Have you ever lost contact with any of your siblings for any reason? Has desolation filled a void in you that was created because you were unable to meet and talk to a loved one who was close to you since childhood?? Of course, some of you must have endured such a nightmare sometime during your lives.??
Siblings can be separated due to various reasons such as adoption, immigration or problems which are personal or family related. Regardless of whatever reason they have disappeared, we want them back in our lives. Some people don?t even know where their siblings live. Locating your long-lost sibling can refresh the phenomenal bond.? ?
Once you locate them, the growing pit in your stomach intensifies and the impatience to meet him or her starts heightening in the depth of your mind. You survive each day, expecting to reunite with your sibling with whom you lost contact years ago. An indescribable feeling mixed with excitement takes control of you until you physically meet your brother or sister.??
When the Daily Mirror met Nirmala in Tamil Nadu, she told us that she hopes to travel to Sri Lanka in a few years time to settle here
It?s never too late to experience great things. The Daily Mirror unearthed a story of identical twin sisters who were separated twenty eight years ago in Mannar due to the thirty-year armed conflict between the LTTE and the Government forces.??
They hadn?t met ever since their father, forced to flee the country, took a boat from Mannar to Tamil Nadu in July 1989, taking with him one of the twins. This was the time when the war was intensifying. The two sisters had reached age 16 when they were separated. The other twin sister remained in Colombo with the mother at a time when their hometown, Mannar, came under a shell attack.??
This writer met Vijaya Nirmala in a refugee camp in Gummidipoondi, Tamil Nadu, last March, where
Sri Lankans reside. Nirmala, now a forty four-year-old mother, was the twin sister who fled the country with her father. She told me about her long lost twin sister named Vijaya Mala who was born just three minutes after Nirmala, in 1973. According to Nirmala, her sister lives in Navalokapura, Sedawatte, Colombo.??
The Daily Mirror went in search Mala. The first day of the search ended, to no avail. Nevertheless, on the second day, a woman who resembled Nirmala opened the door to the eleventh house, we knocked on. It was Mala, the one, we went in search of.??
We showed her recent photographs of her sister Nirmala who shared similar features that of her. She was over the moon literally, as it was the first time she saw a photo of her twin sister.? ?
Breaking down in tears, Mala said she would love to meet her twin sister whom who both have similar traits. ?I can?t wait to touch her, hug her and feel her,? she blurted out.
Neither Mala nor Nirmala had old photographs of them, given that the tense situation in Mannar made them flee their hometown leaving all their belongings behind.??
Though they were unable to meet each other for more than four decades, they have been in touch via telephone. Both had tried hard to find the contact numbers of each other.? ?
?Our father, of Indian origin, tied the knot with our mother, who hails from Colombo. The marriage raised the number of family members to eleven; six brothers, three sisters and the parents. There was a time when all of them lived together in Mannar. However, the war that was intensifying relocated some of the family members in another part in Sri Lanka and sent some to India,? she reflected.? ?
Meanwhile, a terrifying look spread across her face when she spoke of her two brothers. They have been reported missing since July, 1989.??
?When my sister Nirmala was preparing to leave Mannar by boat, the Sri Lankan Army captured two of our brothers, aged 21 and 23. Sundaran and Sekar were captured and it was alleged that they had connections with the LTTE. But, they were innocent. The soldiers had told my father and sister Nirmala that they would release our brothers after questioning them. But, the brothers never returned. They haven?t been heard of since that warm evening,? Mala reminisced.??
They hadn?t met ever since their father, forced to flee the country, took a boat from Mannar to Tamil Nadu in July 1989, taking with him one of the twins. This was the time when the war was intensifying. The two sisters had reached age 16 when they were separated. The other twin sister remained in Colombo with the mother at a time when their hometown, Mannar, came under a shell attack
Not only Mala?s brothers, thousands of similar people are still missing and have been unaccounted for, according to credible reports. However, despite years of searching for clues in the attempts to locate Mala?s brothers have been unsuccessful.??
She said, ?I spent years searching for them in Mannar. Everyone in Mannar told me that both of my brothers had been killed by the Army along with seven other youths belonging to different families. I didn?t believe what they said because I strongly believed that my brothers are still alive. I still cry over them. All I want is to hear the good news that they are still alive,? Mala said, with tears rolling down her cheeks.??
A few years ago, the father of these twins had died due to an illness, inside the refugee camp in Tamil Nadu. Mala said that she was devastated after hearing of her father?s death and said that she wasn?t able to see him for the very last time as financial difficulties didn?t allow her a trip to India.??
She said, ?For our good fortune, our mother still lives with me. All the other family members live scattered in different parts of the country. Only my sister Nirmala is living alone there. We would love to see our sister. But, travelling to India is impossible because I don?t have the money for that,?she said.?
When the Daily Mirror met Nirmala in Tamil Nadu, she told us that she hopes to travel to Sri Lanka in a few years time to settle here. She is waiting until her daughter completes her education.? ?
Her sister Mala said that the day when both sisters meet will be a day filled with overjoyed cries, tears and heartfelt embraces. She further said, ?We lived happily and peacefully before the war. I remember how all of us used to gather in the kitchen, waiting till mother prepared dinner. I remember how our brothers tried to annoy us by cracking lame jokes and attempted to carry us on their shoulders when we frowned at them. Quarrels were put to an end by our beloved father. Those 16 years were the most beautiful moments in my life that will be cherished till forever?.?

CPC will not revise fuel prices despite losses: Chairman
	
The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) today said it will not revise fuel prices despite heavy losses incurred during the past ten years.
CPC Chairman Dhammika Ranatunga said the CPC had incurred a loss of Rs. 300 billion during the past 10 years and during the last nine months it incurred a loss of Rs. 68 billion due to the sale of fuel to state owned subsidiaries.
?The LIOC (Lanka Indian Oil Corporation) has asked for a price increase. However the CPC will not increase fuel prices,? he said.
Addressing the media yesterday Ranatunga said Rs. 11 billion was due from the SriLankan Airlines which had exceeded its rs. 9 billion credit ceiling.
?The highest amount of Rs.40 billion has to be recovered from the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). The CPC will not increase fuel prices as a result of the losses,? Mr. Ranatunga said.
He said despite the dues the current CPC management was looking at alternatives and altered the procurement mechanism, allowing alternative crude oil types.
?The recent tender was awarded for the supply of alternative crude by breaking the supply monopoly, resulting in a saving of around USD 800,000 per single shipment. With the proposed new refinery, CPC will be able to broaden its crude oil procurement options,? he said.
?The new CPC Management has fast-tracked the introduction of additional filtration facilities for jet fuel at Kolonnawa, in compliance with standards set by the Joint Inspection Group (JIG).
?This will ensure all jet fuel that CPC receives to pass through a filtration process, reducing the risk of contamination to the shore tank.
?This helps the procurement process greatly as CPC can remove the conditions in the tender process and open up the competition and reach out to a larger supply base, at far more competitive rates, leading to savings approximately USD 250,000?300,000 per shipment,? he said.
?These changes allow the CPC to run smoothly despite the losses,? he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Responding to questions by journalists following an event held at the BMICH last night, the deputy minister said the committee report proposes to abolish SAITM management and its shareholding. ?????
However, he said there is a policy?which says that Non Governmental Organisations could provide education to some extent.
?This should be allowed. We respect?that policy. But in order to allow?this, there should be a standard. Those who?blame Dr. Neville Fernando should know that he has done something for the?country.

The joint opposition (JO) said today the Steering Committee report containing Constitutional proposals is an essential requirement in the parliamentary resolution outlining the procedure to devise the new Constitution and as such the government should not deride it to deflect public outrage.
It said this when the government reiterated that the report was not the final draft and therefore people should not be alarmed unnecessarily.
Former UPFA MP G.L. Peiris told a news conference that the submission of reports by the six sub-committees and the Steering Committee was a requirement in the resolution adopted by Parliament on Constitution-making.

New Constitution turned into an anti media discussion: JO
	
The joint opposition yesterday said that the process of making a new Constitution has now been turned in to an abhorrence and absurd discussion against the media and the Maha Sangha.
Joint opposition member MP Dullas Alahapperuma told a news conference that recently it was reported how Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had lashed out at the media institutions with regard to the Constitution.
?This discussion has now turned in to an anti-media discussion. They were saying that the media is in an attempt to unstable the government through this discussion on the Constitution,? he added.
He said on the other hand, the discussion on the Constitution had been turned in to a discussion against the Maha Sangha and added that it was evident that the effort of these authorities for a changed-Constitution was dishonest.
Meanwhile, MP Alahapperuma said that the joint opposition was waiting for the Supreme Court?s intervention to the petitions filed against the Provincial Council Elections (Amendment) Bill, which was passed in Parliament in September in an unlawful manner.

## Title: Our criticism, their criticism An indictment of sorts

Our criticism, their criticism An indictment of sorts
	
The role of the critic is at once curious and contradictory; he isn?t required to know what the artiste he is assessing does, yet he has the prerogative to measure that artiste on the standards he himself has created for him. It takes years and years of film schools and acting classes to become a great performer, but no amount of craftsmanship, however nurtured or fermented, can compensate for those slight shifts of quality which the critic notices, notes and advertises. You can contend that becoming an artiste is therefore intensely more difficult than being a critic, but in reality it?s the other way around when you account for quality; being a good, insightful critic is, all things considered, more difficult than being a good, insightful artist.? ?
Obviously this isn?t too worrying in countries where theatres and film halls are as much a part of ordinary experiences as offices and factories, but in Sri Lanka where film halls are rarely full (even during weekends) and theatres barely attended (even when it?s your typical political or comedy skit) not having good critics does tend to alarm and disconcert. Even with the internet and the very many portals (which can be about anything, from film reviews to theatre reviews to situation reports) that promise much on the day they?re launched and yet are shut down on the next, people still prefer newspapers, and most of our writers and commentators prefer what the people do. The printed word is here to stay, at least for quite some time.? ?
Criticism in Sri Lanka is mostly divided along linguistic lines: Sinhala and Tamil on the one hand and English on the other. I?m sure there are subtle differences between Sinhala and Tamil writers but these have to do largely with temperament and experience; the difference between them and their English counterpart is less subtle, and is marked less by temperamental rifts than by differences which go deep into their way of responding to their societies, their world. It?s all a reflection of the milieu which panders to them, respectively, because demographically the Sinhala and the Tamil critic have a larger audience, a varied base, which the English critic does not, has not and probably will not. The former two enjoy a diverse public and that diversity prevents them from congealing to an identifiable style or form of criticism. The latter, because his public is relatively small, does not suffer this impediment.? ?
Because he enjoys a smaller audience, generally from a rather affluent, indulgent milieu, the techniques and, I dare say, styles he resorts to are predictable, sometimes despairingly so. The typical English review, or piece or scoop or whatever you may call it, teems with references to what people, from the audience it panders to, thinks or will think about a production. But then that?s to be expected, because even though he may not be on intimate terms with their cast and crew he knows them all the same, because like his audiences they belong to the same coterie and milieu he writes on. They don?t desire it and frankly they detest it ? from my experiences thus far I can testify that they want the same kind of throbbing, worthwhile reviews their Sinhala counterparts are getting in the press and elsewhere ? and yet they have to suffer it because that?s what our English critics operate on; mediocre, shallow profundity.? ?
It would be easy to conclude that all this is the critic?s fault, but that?s not completely true. There are factors beyond his or her control which force him to compromise, to scuttle otherwise perceptive pieces, like the fact that our newspaper columns have diminished in scope and size to accommodate images at the cost of words. Economy, more specifically word economy, is the password in this age of jerky breaks and cuts and fast-paced, mindless television, and no one has felt this more deeply, more negatively, than your typical English reviewer. The latest play or book or film will gain as much text as pictures, in itself not a bad thing except for the fact that the pictures are there to preside over and overwhelm the text. And how? By using them to bring up what?s easily identifiable about the English cultural sphere in this country ? names and faces, who?s adapting what famous musical from where, and so on. (The typical Sinhala and Tamil film review almost never contains images that transcend the text this way, which is why our best movie critics come from the vernacular press.)? ?
Photographs, sketchy interviews, and randomly sought after comments do more for the English reviewer than an actual review because the people he writes on and writes for know each other well, and are usually on intimate terms. They?re like neighbours in the same community, at their most intimate with one another when they meet during a show. The critic in this sense emphasises on what his readers know, not what they should know, which is disheartening since this means that he is failing in his primary task: to get those readers beyond the present into the hereafter. In other words, they are stuck in time because they believe in the timelessness of what they stand for, which I think is the main reason why they are indicted as being culturally uprooted. They are joyously smug, joyously complacent, joyously indifferent.? ?
The Sinhala critic can write with more vivacity and authenticity on our movies, our plays, our books, because they have ready access to the necessary material and they are enthusiastic about getting that material across. They know that?s what their readers want. In a way the fact that we are a local majority and a global minority is reflected in our confused and at times contradictory feelings when it comes to the vernacular and the English press: we are happy when a Sinhala critic writes about an objet d?art in a way that does justice to the objet and the auteur, but we are also happy, despite our limited understanding of the language, when we come across an English critic, no matter how lopsided his review may be, doing the same.? ?
There?s a culture of sullen indifference within the English intelligentsia when it comes to reviews and reviewers. They are more interested in how the critic notes down those points that make them part of a clique within an already domineering clique (the part within the whole). Yes, they are also interested in the perceptive review but because mediocrity has become a norm they are, quite naturally, indifferent, cynical, and not a little sceptical. I have come across instances where they have expressed delight, overwhelming joy, when the person taken in to assess what they?ve done at least partially captures what they intended. They aren?t sullen for nothing, after all.? ?
On the other hand, even a mediocre English review will glean gasps and smiles of pleasant surprise and contentment from their Sinhala counterparts. The other day I happened to give a newspaper clipping of one of my reviews to some young boys who happened to be actors and producers attached to a drama society I had written on and they were stumped; the review was eagerly passed from one set of hands to another, making the rounds around the hall I was in, until it reached the last boy, probably the smallest and youngest of them all, who came up to me with an almost toothless grin, handed it over, and said, ?Thank you sir.? They know gratitude because they know the excitement of seeing what they toil for in the press, in a language they want their work to be expressed and discussed in. Which brings me to my next, and final, point.? ?
Barring the occasional freelancer, there?s no one in the English media to write on our movies, our plays, our books, our artists. The Sinhala critics are streets ahead in this regard, because they not only have the necessary material but also know how to make that material relevant to their readers. You almost never get that kind of penetrating insight from the English critic for the simple reason that a) he is not used to penetrating insights even when writing for his own readers, and b) he hardly bothers writing for another audience. No one wrote on Handagama?s Age Asa Aga, for instance, and no one reviewed Vithanage?s Oba Nathuwa Oba Ekka. To be sure, there are exceptions, especially in the movies (which are the most democratised works of art in Sri Lanka), but never in the theatre or in our book industry, not anymore.? ?
Why should this bother us? Because no culture was ever salvaged, purveyed, promoted, and disseminated without a horde of instinctive, incisive writers. In part this stems from the critic?s own lack of awareness of that culture, and the artists it breeds. In part this stems also from the lack of any new excitement in what our filmmakers and playwrights and novelists are doing, even though they are more willing, and more able, to absorb much of what?s happening elsewhere.? ?
But I don?t think that that latter point is reason for complacency over the way things are going with respect to our English reviewers. They are as stuck in time as many of those they write on and for, they often don?t know what?s happening in other cultural spheres, and they are conditioned to tone down, be as simplistic as possible, and get whatever message across. The only consolation we have, of course, is that those other cultural spheres have ?local? reviewers who are great, if not much, much better. But the world operates elsewhere, not here, and the world speaks another dialect, another language. We have people who speak that dialect, that language, but not enough to properly convey what their own artists are doing, here, now, and probably forever.? ? ?

Political influence on IGP to stop CID probe
	
The IGP is reportedly facing unwarranted political interference demanding that the CID probe into the death threats received by Anika Wijesuriya from a relative of former finance minister Ravi Karunanayake, be stopped, sources said.
Ms. Wijesuriya is the owner of the penthouse at Monarch residencies, a penthouse which was rented out by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) to be occupied by the former minister?s family.
Based on the instructions of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) into the Central Bank bond issue, the IGP had previously provided police protection to Ms. Wijesuriya and her family members due to threats to her life, allegedly received by her, causing her to go abroad from where she had lodged a complaint via an email to the CID about the threat to her life.
Subsequently, the IGP had ordered the CID to launch an investigation into the claims made by Ms. Wijesuriya.
However, once the CID had launched an investigation into the matter, the Police Chief had reportedly been pressurised to take the probe away from the CID.
Additional Solicitor General President?s Counsel Yasantha Kodagoda, who revealed the threats to her life received by Ms. Wijesuriya, had also claimed her brother Vijitha had also been on the receiving end of several death threats said to have been made by a relative of former minister Karunanayake.

Political pressure prompted untimely opening of Yala Block-I
	
Block-I of the Yala National Park was declared open nine days prior to the scheduled date on October 23 due to political pressure from a powerful minister, said Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya, former Director General, Wildlife Conservation Department (WLCD).
The decision to close the park on September1 was taken by the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) and on the advice of a special committee appointed by the Prime Minister?s Office.
?Although the national park was reopened last Monday, it was earlier decided to be reopened on October 31 after being closed for two months due to the prevalent drought condition and low rainfall,? Dr. Pilapitiya said.
On a different note, Dr. Pilapitiya said tourist arrivals had gradually increased over the years, and from 2008 to 2016, there had been a 1,000 per cent increase in tourist arrivals.
?As the former DG, I would say the DWC, during the past fifteen years or so, was politicised to a great extent. This decision was purely political and undermines the authority of DWC in administering one of its national parks, and brings the whole environmental and conservation policy of this country into disrepute. We strongly protest this politically-motivated decision. It is detrimental to the future authority of DWC, compromises its conservation function and is injurious to the well-being of this country and its people. This is not good governance,? he added.

President orders renegotiation of talks with prospective int'l airlines
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed the apex economic management body, the National Economic Commission (NEC) to renegotiate a dialogue with two international airlines in a bid to resuscitate the national carrier Sri Lankan Airlines (SLA) including the old partner Emirates and the latest rounds of talks have been satisfactory, a reliable senior government source said.
?The issue of the future of the national carrier SLA was taken up by President Sirisena at the last NEC meeting held before his official visit to Qatar. It was pointed out by Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim, who is also a member of the NEC that negotiations would begin very soon to set up a joint venture or outright sale of the SLA which has an outstanding debt of US4 600 million (more than Rs. 90 billion),? the source said on condition of anonymity. This large debt portfolio is holding back investors who are unwilling to partner with the SLA but reluctant to take up the liability,? he added.
Earlier, the cabinet appointed negotiating committee comprising Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Minister Hashim and Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama had a several rounds of detailed discussions with Emirates. The airline has raised its disappointment on the unilateral abrogation of the management agreement agreement with the SLA by the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime without considering the impact on Sri Lanka?s economy, tourism and the fate of the SLA. The sudden and imprudent decision had been taken reportedly on the instructions of UPFA national list MP and former President Rajapaksa?s right hand man and consultant Sajin Vaas Gunawardana, he noted
?A large question mark is hanging over the deals negotiated to purchase 6 brand new Airbuses as the price quoted has been much higher than the prevailing market price and the FCID is investigating the deal right now, he said.
?Tim Clark, the CEO of Emirates has stated during the first round of negotiations that the Emirates was willing to be partnered with the SLA once again but not ready for an equity partnership. However, the current negotiating team of the government is confident that further discussion would be continued until an agreement in a win-win situation is reached to both, he added.
Meanwhile, a Japanese airline has also expressed interests for a partnership agreement sponsored by a leading Sri Lankan businessman with interests in tourism, banking, insurance and milk products, he said.
The dispute arose when the Emirates refused to bump 35 passengers from a full London-Colombo flight to make way for former President Rajapaksa and his entourage in December 2007. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

## Title: Pricing formula for fuel by March next year; electricity by September

Pricing formula for fuel by March next year; electricity by September
	
The government is committed to introduce a cost-reflective pricing formula for fuel and electricity by next year, Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy said.
?The government is now committed under the structural benchmarks of the IMF to introduce a pricing formula for fuel in March and a pricing formula for energy probably by September, next year,? Coomaraswamy told a forum in Colombo, this week.
State-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has a near total monopoly in electricity generation and a total monopoly in transmission and distribution in Sri Lanka, while Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) has only one private sector competitor?Lanka Indian Oil Company PLC.
Both the CEB and CPC have been selling their products and services at subsidized prices and as a result, have accumulated losses running into billions of rupees, becoming two of the largest loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
			?Govt. committed to introduce price formula under IMF structural benchmarks
				This will allow CEB and CPC to price products and services in a cost-reflective manner
				Successive governments have used electricity tariffs and fuel prices to sway voters
			
		Although the government directs these two state-owned utilities to sell their products and services at subsidized prices, no budgetary transfers are done to support these subsidies, leaving them with a precarious financial predicament, which becomes toxic with their inherent inefficiencies. ?
A pricing formula will allow these utilities to price their products and services in a cost-reflective manner and keep the political interferences at bay. Successive governments have used electricity tariffs and fuel prices to sway voters during election times.
This has pushed Sri Lanka repeatedly into vicious economic cycles. For example, the decision announced in the November 2011 budget not to increase electricity tariffs during the Mahinda Rajapaksa administration led the country into a balance of payment crisis.
Sri Lanka is a net importer of oil and it is used as fuel in transportation and also used to produce thermal power. Due to the recent drought situation in the country, the hydropower generation came down to about 40 percent, making the country to import more
oil.According to the Central Bank data, Sri Lanka?s oil import bill in the first eight months rose 43.4 percent year-on-year to Rs.2.2 billion. This was a result of higher import volumes due to increased thermal power generation as well as rising global oil prices.
The average import price of crude oil was recorded at US $ 53.07 per barrel in August 2017 compared to US $ 46.71 per barrel recorded in August 2016.
The implementation of a pricing formula for fuel and electricity has always been a challenge for successive governments, given the political risks associated with such a move. The present coalition government is expected to face some tough local government elections this January.?

Train kills  Indian athlete on Bambalapitiya railway track
	
Life is so fragile. None of us knows when the end is nearing. On October 23 (Wednesday) Rajendranath Panigrahi, an Indian athlete, was killed in a train mishap in Bambalapitiya. The athlete was attempting to take a selfie of himself against the backdrop of the sea at the time of his death.? ?
63-year-old Panigrahi arrived in Sri Lanka on October 19 to participate in the Inter-mercantile Athletics Championships along with 38 other athletes from India. The Championship was held at the Sugathadasa Stadium from October 20-22. These Indian athletes were scheduled to leave Sri Lanka on October 23. On the way to the airport the bus they were travelling in stopped at Bambalapitya. Some of the athletes, including Panigrahi, disembarked from the bus as they wanted to buy packets of green tea from the shops nearby.
Panigrahi headed towards the rail tracks with the intention of taking a picture of himself. When attempting to take a selfie, without his knowledge, a train was headed in his direction. The train knocked into him, pushing him away. Panigrahi died on the spot. Thilini Munasinghe, a friend of Panigrahi?s son, who accompanied the group, said that although the driver had tooted the horn, Panigrahi didn?t hear the sound and was unable to move away on time.? ?
Panigrahi was from Jagdalpur, Chhattisgarh, India. He leaves behind his? wife and three sons. According to Munasinghe, Panigrahi was a very nice, friendly and fit gentleman. He took part in the senior events and took part in the 55+ age group category.? ?

The Daily Mirror spoke to Dharmapaal Sharma, Senior Team Manager and a gifted athlete himself, who stayed behind in order to conduct the formalities necessary in connection with the Panigrahi?s death. Sharma said that Sri Lanka and India invite each other when these countries take turns hosting this championship. He further explained that the participants who contested the Inter-mercantile Athletics Championships were from different parts of India and weren?t from just one state.? ?
The body of the athlete was taken to the Colombo National Hospital where the postmortem was conducted by Dr. Sriyantha Amararathne, Consultant Judicial Medical Officer. ?At the first instance I thought that the cause of death was due to a head injury. But upon further inspection, it was concluded that the cause was due to multiple injuries in the head, neck, thorax, abdomen and the limb due to blunt force trauma. This injury pattern is consistent with the railway accidents,? explained Dr. Amararathne.? ?
The remains of the deceased will be taken to Visakhapatnam on October 26 (Thursday).? ?
