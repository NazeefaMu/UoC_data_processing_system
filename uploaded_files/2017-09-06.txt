Bid to use ?poor relief? to fund building project fails
	
Gabby Senior Banda from the hills who had to make it to Diyawanna through the ?list? the other day sought the approval of the top team for a supplementary estimate involving a hefty amount for putting up a headquarters for ?the poor relief? campaign. He also had proposed that the estimated expenditure be met from the monies available in the ?poor relief? bank.?
?
The authorities in the highest echelons in yahapalanaya had made discreet inquiries as to why the purohita had brought up a costly mega project like a bolt from the blues.?
So the authorities had advised him to give up the idea saying that constructing costly massive buildings is not the need of the hour. Highly dejected, the purohita is with a long face these days, they say.?

Big Vig does it again
	
?
Number One in yahapalanaya recently invited the provincial chiefs to a confab to be followed by a dinner.
?
The main purpose of this meeting was to seek the support of the provincial bodies for the passage of the 20th Amendment.?
However, the Northern chief was conspicuous by his absence at this confab. Only the governing one was there to represent the Northern body.
At the outset there was a big question mark over the Northern one?s absence, because the political party he represents had already decided to back the Amendment. However, it transpired later that Big Vig had really boycotted the event because he and his cohorts who had embarked on a political journey of their own had already decided to defeat the proposed Amendment.?
Given the indications that several other provincial bodies too are set to defeat the Amendment, the latest design aimed at making a further postponement of the polls might go haywire, they say.?

Coaxed into occupying his official residence
	
?
Number One in yahapalanaya had recently paid a courtesy call on the grey haired-opposition leader from the North.?
?
The Colombo 7 official residence allocated to the opposition leader which still remains unoccupied too had come up for discussion at this meeting.
Although the veteran politico is entitled to an official residence apart from an office building by the virtue of the office he holds, he has refused to occupy the official bungalow so far saying that he did not feel like enjoying comforts of a posh residence when some people he represents do not have a proper roof over their heads. ?However, the veteran politico had conceded that given his old age he finds difficult to go up to and come down from the apartment he currently occupies which is located on a top floor of the building.?
Then Number One had told him: ?I can understand your difficulty. ?Please go into the occupation of your official residence at least now. There is nothing wrong with your occupying it given your present physical condition??
The veteran politico who accepted Number One?s advice has now decided to move into his office residence on September 15.?

Deleted recordings reveal Aloysius had inside information
	
After playing several ?deleted? phone recordings of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd (PTL) before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) today, Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda said that now it was evident that PTL owner Arjun Aloysius had received price sensitive inside information before the March 29, 2016 bond auction.
Additional Solicitor General Kodagoda today played three phone recordings before the Commission. These recording were earlier deleted from the PTL voice logger system but Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado had kept the recording in four backup DVDs.
One conversation was between PTL CEO Kasun Palisena and its Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado and the other two conversations were between Palisena and PTL owner Arjun Aloysius.
These recordings were played while PTL Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado was testifying before the Commission clarifying certain matters that came to light from the phone conversations.
The first phone recording between Palisena and Salgado originated from Palisena, who was in the United Kingdom at that point of time (12.58 p.m. on August 8, 2016).
Playing the recording, ASG Kodagoda said that he was not fully confident about the date of the call as reflected in the voice recordings backup.
In this conversation, Kasun Palisena was asking Nuwan Salgado to get some documents from PTL owner Arjun Aloysius. Palisena tells Salgado that Arjun Aloysius had received documents -- a copy of the statement -- relating to what Palisena testified before the Parliamentary oversight committee COPE, from ?Rosy?s son.?
At this moment Justice Prasanna Jayawardena asked ASG Kodagoda that he be cautious about the mandate given to the PCoI since those matters are relating to Parliament. However, ASG Kodagoda was of the view that he would draw the necessary line in relation to the relevancy of that conversation to the mandate of the PCoI.
ASG Kodagoda: Who is Palisena Referring to as Rosy?
Witness Salgado: Rosy Senanayake (Former member of the D.E.W. Gunasekara?s COPE in the seventh Parliament)
ASG: Who is referred to as Rosy?s son?
W: Kanishka Senanayake
When questioned as to what sort of relationship Aloysius had with Kanishka Senanayake, the witness said that he had heard that Aloysius and Kanishka were friends.
ASG: Why did Kasun Palisena wanted you to get the documents from Aloysius?
W: Palisena wanted those copies of the statements to be sent to the Governor.
ASG: You are referring to which governor?
W: I understood it as Arjun Mahendran.
At this point, Justice Jayawardena in a convinced manner told ASG Kodagoda that ?Now it is related to our mandate because now the witness said that he was asked to send those statements to Arjun Mahendran?
ASG Kodagoda adding amusement to the query said that ?Now I am relieved?.
On being questioned by Justice Jayawardena, the witness also said that he had thereafter conveyed Palisena?s request to Arjun Aloysius. Later Aloysius had taken over the matter.
Then the remaining part of that first phone recording (between Palisena and Salgado) was played.
In this part, Mr Salgado was informing Palisena about one Sanjeewa Fernando. Salgado says that Sanjeewa Fernando had asked him to give details relating to PTL and the general market. Salgado also tells that Sanjeewa was about go to ?Ela Madde Gedara? (Parliament). Salgado and Palisena both seem alarmed that Sanjeewa is going to Parliament without being properly prepared. They exchange words in Sinhala as:
Salgado: Machan? Naai (bath) Peralagena Naai (He will get properly fixed)
Palisena: Pissekne (mad fellow)
This Sanjeewa Fernando is known to be a director of PTL and however, he had not gone for any of the COPE meetings to give evidence. Therefore Justice Jayawardena told AG?s Department officials to check on Sanjeewa Fernando?s visit to Parliament.
ASG Kodagoda then played another two phone recordings relating to the conversations that took place between Palisena and Aloyius on March 29, 2016 at 9.18 a.m.
The first of these two phone calls had originated from Kasun Palisena and taken to the mobile phone of Nuwan Salgado.
At that point of time, Nuwan Salgado and Aloysius were in Singapore attending the Finance Asia Summit 2016?, which was sponsored by PTL.
Salgado said when he received the call from Palisena, he was with Aloysius in his hotel room and thereafter he gave his mobile phone to Aloysius to talk with Palisena. The witness said thereafter he had left the room.
ASG Kodagoda: Why did you leave the room?
Witness Salgado: I did not want to discuss that part of that conversation. I understood that it was illegal things or information that are talked and passed between them.
Justice Jayawardena: What made you to think of leaving the room considering that there will be a discussion of inside information with Palisena by Aloysius?
Witness: When the phone was ringing, Aloysius said that there was a decision that had been taken after a meeting and he was about to convey the information to Palisena.
Justice: Did Aloysius have such information received in the past as well?
W: He would know about meetings, like bankers.
Justice: What else?
W: I can?t recall them.
At this moment ASG Kodagoda explained to the Commission that this conversation had taken place when the March 29, 2016 auction was about to commence.
In this conversation, Arjun Aloysius informs Palisena that there were a few major decisions that had been taken from a recently finished meeting (high level meeting).
Aloysius specifically advises PTL CEO Palisena that there would not be a rate hike as the market expected. Aloysius refers to one source from where he received information as ?Our friend in the Department?. Aloysius also advises Palisena as how to bid in the upcoming auction (March 29, 2016) based on the inside information he received from a source.
Additional Solicitor General Kodagoda thereafter played the third phone recording which was between Arjun Aloysius and Palisena (20 minutes) in the same morning at 9.34 a.m. (March 29, 2016).
In this Conversation too Aloysius instructs Palisena how to place bids in the March 29, 2016 auction.
Aloysius explains to Palisena on the volumes of the bids and the rates at which those bids should be placed in the auctions.
Aloysius also tells Palisena of the importance of bidding at the auction by referring ?Our person wants us to bid??
Aloysius tells his CEO Palisena the exact volume and rate digits at which the EPF and NSB would bid at the auction. Aloysius also says in the conversation that he was fully confident about the amount that would be accepted at the auction as well.
It was quite evident in those two recordings that Aloysius was instructing Palisena (CEO of PTL) while having inside information regarding the bond auctions in his possession.
ASG Yasantha Kodagoda was of the view that it was very evident that Arjun Aloysius had received price sensitive inside information prior to the March 29 auction from certain sources.
ASG Kodagoda: Aloysius was referring to an individual who wanted PTL to bid at the Auction, who was he?
Witness: That I don?t know.
ASG: Cut off point of an auction is decided by whom? (How much will be accepted at the auction)
W: Public Debt Department (PDD)
ASG: PDD recommends it and then it goes to the Tender Board (TB), right?
W: Yes
ASG: After the TB approval, who ultimately approves it?
W: The CBSL governor
ASG: At that time who was the Governor?
W: Arjuna Mahendran
ASG: And Arjuna Mahendran is the father-in-law of Arjun Aloysius, right?
W: Yes
On being questioned by Justice Prasanna Jayawardena, the witness also said it was a familiar scenario where Arjun Aloysius instructs Palisena in the business.
Justice Jayawardena: Prior to this conversation, Aloysius was in the habit of giving instructions, right?
Witness seemed avoiding the question and Justice Jayawardena in a strict manner asked him not to do so and speak loudly and answers the questions.
Justice Jayawardena: Aloysius knew about the bids of EPF before the auction, how could it be?
W: He may have got information from certain persons from the EPF.
J: Who decides on bids at EPF?
W: The primarily dealer
J: Who was the dealer at that time?
W: Saman Kumara
It was also revealed that one Naveen Anuradha was the then dealer at NSB during the March 29, 2016 auction.
Justice Jayawardena also questioned Salgado on the inside information received by Aloysius about the amounts of bids that would be accepted. Justice Jayawardena observed that the ultimate decision with regard to accepting bids at an auction is taken by former Governor Arjun Mahendran.
ASG Kodagoda also revealed that PTL had gained a phenomenal profit aggregating Rs. 11 Billion during the time period 2015 to 2016. The ASG said PTL managed to gain such huge profits in the backdrop where the second highest profit maker in Bond trading had only about Rs. 500 million during this time.
ASG Kodagoda was of the view that throughout these transactions, PTL had received critical price sensitive information from sources and that made them earn massive profits in a short period of time in the business as a primary dealer.

Eight passengers failed to check-in on time, refused access to flight
	
The SriLankan Airlines today said that eight passengers scheduled to fly in flight UL195 from Bandaranaike International Airport on Tuesday had failed to check-in on time and therefore, had not been allowed to get on board the flight.
In a statement, the Airline said this group of passengers had reported to the check-in counters after the check-in counters had been closed.
?The SriLankan staff at the counters informed them that the airline is unable to accept them on the flight due to the closure of the counters. The safety and comfort of all passengers is of paramount importance to SriLankan Airlines and we regret any inconvenience that the passengers may have undergone,? it said. ?
However, it said that the Airline cannot accept passengers after check-in counters are closed as it may cause a delay and/or disrupt the departure procedures of the flight.
?The ?Conditions of Carriage for Passengers and Baggage? clearly state that all SriLankan check-in counters close one hour prior to the scheduled time of departure and advise passengers to arrive well in time for check-in,? it said.

A group of about 20 Green backbenchers was seen at a hotel named after a fish on the Mount Lavinia beach in an evening the other day.

This group in fact, had been invited to a dinner at the hotel. The host was a filthy rich powerful former top team purohita.?
The members who were dined and wined to their heart?s content had learnt later that the motive behind the grand dinner hosted to them by the affluent politico was to win their support for a ?radical pressure group? within the party which he has planned to lead.?

Japan talking to SL and India on developing Trinco Port
	
Japan has initiated talks with Sri Lanka and India on the development of the strategically-located Trincomalee Port, Ambassador Kenichi Suganuma said.
He told a group of journalists that Trincomalee was an important, strategically located deep sea port and had a lot of potential for development.
The Ambassador said Japan had agreed to supply navigation buoys with electronically communicable devises for the facilitation of naval movements in the harbour in the night. "We have begun discussions with India on how best to develop the port in the future. There are no concrete plans yet,? he said.
The Ambassador said trilateral discussions were being held among Sri Lanka, Japan and India for the generation of energy using environmentally-friendly Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG).
?Sri Lanka?s demand for power is on the rise. We have started talks with India for trilateral cooperation,? he said.
Commenting on Japanese-funded projects in Sri Lanka, he said his country?s investment amounted to Rs.1.8 trillion.
?The overall assessment is that these projects are good. They contributed to the development of the country. We have a system of evaluating the results by a third-party committee. The recommendations are favourable. I am very glad that wherever I go and speak to people, they sound happy. We have many other projects such as cultural exchanges. These are also well received by the Sri Lankan people,? the Ambassador said.
He said his country needed to be selective and focus on certain areas as it could not do everything.
?In the case of Sri Lanka, we have three sectors. One is high quality infrastructure to boost Sri Lanka's growth, particularly in the area of exports. Secondly, the reduction of income disparities is there, particularly in regard to the vulnerable segments of society. We have to remedy this. Then, the reduction of social vulnerabilities such as floods and landslides are there. This is about official development. We also promote Japanese private investment,? the Ambassador said.

Mahiyangana?s human-elephant conflict shows cracks in cultures of habitat
	
Habitat loss has resulted in elephants coming in to direct contact with humans. The animals, which were long revered in the country?s culture and religion, have now become a symbol of conflict over the past few years. Although wildlife enthusiasts have protested against human encroachment and have suggested possible ways of keeping away from these animals, humans seem to be doing the opposite. As a result, over 2000 elephants have perished in to the soil as a result of this conflict during the past 12 years. The conflict still exists in many parts of the country although many incidents aren?t reported. ??
According to Karunasena it has been six years since the human-elephant conflict raised its head
	As a result of the human-elephant conflict people don?t have any food during the Yala or Maha seasons
	Several houses had been destroyed by this ferocious elephant
	People want the authorities to pay them an adequate amount of money because a few thousand rupees won?t do any justice
Cries from conflict areas?
While on a recent visit to Mahiyangana, the Daily Mirror learned that several houses had been damaged as a result of this conflict during early August. Hence, with the help of our guide, Ajith, we then took off to visit the affected. While speaking to the victims the Daily Mirror learned that the electric fences in the area have been switched off and that they were the only solution to the problem. ??
K.G Ranmanika?s house was severely damaged and the vegetable plots too were destroyed. She is currently residing at her daughter?s house situated a few blocks away from hers. ?That night I heard a noise outside the house and when I went to see it was this elephant. I stayed indoors just to be safe and he did a lot of damage to the house. A little while later, the DWC officials visited my house and promised to give compensation and asked me to stay away from the house till they capture the elephant,?said Ranmanika.?
R. M Karunasena is another victim of this human-elephant conflict. Karunasena said that it has been six years since the human-elephant conflict raised its head. ?We have stopped working in our paddy fields and we don?t expect any yield from our vegetation because elephants now thrive on them. As a result we don?t have any food during the Yala or Maha seasons. Those days they used to come at night and now they come even during the day as well,? said Karunasena.
As we walked further in to this now-peaceful village setting in the heart of Mahiyangana, our guide Ajith showed more houses that had been destroyed by this ferocious elephant. We then stepped in to D. Kanthilatha?s house to observe the damages. She is a self-employed woman who earns a fair income to feed her family by making hoppers. ?My son is sick and I have to take him to Colombo every month. For that I need approximately Rs. 3000 or more. A few days back this elephant destroyed our kitchen and now I have to fix those damages as well. I even wrote a letter to the DWC officials because they don?t ?compensate us on time. This is the first time that we were attacked by an elephant, but there have been instances when elephants loitered around the village quite often. We want them to pay us an adequate amount of money because a few thousand rupees won?t do any justice,?she said.?
Karunarathne and his sister live in close proximity to Kanthilatha?s. The following day, after Kanthilatha?s house was damaged, the elephant had gone in search of more food and had stopped at Karunarathne?s residence and consumed a gunny bag full of paddy. ?I was at home with my sister when we heard a noise outside. Then the neighbours shouted warning us to stay indoors that an elephant was trying to bring down the house. Luckily there wasn?t much damage except for the front door which had a few cracks. The Maduru Oya forest reserve lies in the boundary of this village. As a result many untamed elephants frequent our village. We urge the DWC officials to take this elephant away before it takes away an innocent life,?Karunarathne pleaded.
I was at home with my sister when we heard a noise outside. Then the neighbours shouted warning us to stay indoors that an elephant was trying to bring down the house. Luckily there wasn?t much damage
?We don?t have water and have to walk miles to collect one gallon and then we have an elephant adding to the burden,? said Wijerathne carrying a plastic can filled to the brim with water. The prevailing drought has affected over 1.3 million individuals including those in Mahiyangana. ?There is no permanent solution to this human-elephant conflict. A few months ago there were electric fences, but they don?t work anymore. If the electric fences were switched on this issue would have been solved to a greater extent, but that doesn?t seem to be the case. So far the DWC officials haven?t visited us to inquire about the latest incidents, but we hope that they would take the necessary measures,?said Wijerathne.?
?Compensation given isn?t enough? : Grama Niladhari for Orubandiwewa and Serana Divisions
?Wildlife officials offer compensation, but that isn?t enough,? said D. M. P Dissanayake, the Grama Niladhari for Orubandiwewa and Serana Divisions. ?Elephants frequent in Divisions such as Abeypura, Gemunupura, Arawatta, Serana and Orubandiwewa where there are tanks. The officials offered compensation depending on the extent of the damage caused. Therefore some claim to be underpaid in most instances. Some have been promised two bags of cement, but that wouldn?t solve the problem. Even the electric fences have been switched off and the elephants trample them down and charge in to the villages,? Dissanayake said.?
?We are trying to promote coexistence rather than confrontation? : Gamini Jayawickrama Perera
On this note we contacted the subject minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera who said that the sum has been increased to Rs. 500,000. ?During the Rajapakse regime it was only Rs. 100,000, but we increased the amount. The usual procedure is for the Grama Sevaka (GS) to send a letter to the office of the Ministry of Health. The letter in turn goes to the Divisional Secretariat (DS). This is then sent to the area DS and he pays the amount with his funds. But now this transaction has been made easier. So it?s up to the DS and the GS to provide funds for the victims. On the other hand we aren?t offering contracts to put up electric fences and it is a responsibility vested upon the people. So we provide residents with raw materials and they have to put up the fence. In the case of crop damage we have introduced an insurance scheme so that the affected can recover the damages. Hence we are trying to promote coexistence rather than confrontation with these elephants,?the minister said.?
Statistics
Deputy Director (Elephant Conservation) at the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) U.L Thaufeeq told the Daily Mirror that 129 elephants have been killed due to the prevailing human elephant conflict within this year. ?In addition to that 44 people have been killed as well. So far we have offered compensation worth Rs. 500,000 to each victim whose house was damaged and to those families who have lost a member during an encounter. If a person is injured we offer Rs. 75,000 as compensation. So far we haven?t implemented any compensation scheme for crop damage, but if the cultivation has been insured then they will be paid accordingly,?explained Thaufeeq.

No lands in Colombo to build more houses: PM
	
There are no lands in the Colombo city to construct houses any more and the country is marching towards a scarcity of lands, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament today.
The Premier made this point in response to a question raised by UNP MP M. H. M. Salman in the House.
"The government will have to rethink about the land policy as a result of the impending situation. There were only a population of five million in the country when polices regarding lands were made but now we will have to change policies and may have to go for condominiums," he said.
However, he assured that the government will go ahead with its election promise to provide lands for the landless. (By Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

No whereabouts of Arjun Aloysius: CID
	
In the wake of the breakthrough made by Attorney General?s Department against Arjun Aloysius that he had received inside information with regard to the price sensitive details in bond trading, the PCoI had summoned him on September 5 to record a statement with CID officials.
However, ASG Yasantha Kodagoda informed the Commission that CID officials had visited Aloysius? residence to serve the summons yesterday but failed to do so because he was not there at that time. The ASG said that Aloysius was not even at his office.
ASG Kodagoda also said that Aloysius? personal secretary, ?Sammuel?, whose name transpired during the proceedings, was also not cooperating with the investigators because Sammuel had said that he did not know about the whereabouts of his boss at that time.
In this backdrop, ASG Kodagoda asked Aloysius? counsel Anuja Premaratne PC to convey the message to his client to appear before the CID.
Consequently, the ASG also requested the Counsel to provide numbers relating to the two legal passports of Aloysius (Australia and Sri Lanka). Counsel said he will contact his client and provide them.
However, the Commission was of the view that Aloysius will have to testify before the Commission from next Monday (September 11).
The Commission also informed the Counsel who appeared for Aloysius that the Commission had now summoned him to come and if he was not complying with it then he might have to deal with the consequences because now there was more convincing evidence against him before the PCoI.

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today said since President Maithripala Sirisena visited the top floor of Pohottuwa (The Lotus Tower), he may also join with the Pohottuwa Party.
Speaking to journalists outside the Welikada Prison after visiting former MP Sarana Gunawardane, Mr. Rajapaksa said Pohottu would bloom all over the island in the near future apart from the Lotus Tower in Colombo.
"The President will also come to our Pohottuwa as things proceed,? he said.
However, he said though they formed a new party called Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), they were still members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)
?We have created a party and are in the process of creating an alliance to contest at elections,? he said.
When asked about the statements made by Field Marshal Minister Sarath Fonseka over war crimes, Mr. Rajapaksa said only a lost candidate should respond to another lost candidate.
He also said there was no need of a No-Confidence Motion against Minister Fonseka as he was someone who was not elected to Parliament.
?I don?t think anyone will bring in a No-Confidence Motion against someone who came to Parliament out of luck and not by votes,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said today that Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka's statement on former Army Commander Jagath Jayasuriya was not the stance of the Government and that it was his personal opinion.
He told Parliament that the "Good Governance" Government would never imprison Army Commanders like the previous Government.
He said this in response to a question posed by Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane whether Field Marshal Fonseka's statement on Mr. Jayasuriya represented the Government?s policy.
Mr. Gunawardane asked what action would be taken against betrayal of the country's security forces by the Members of the Government.
He said the statement made by President Maithripala Sirisena contradicted with the statement made by Minister Fonseka.
Posing a question MP Gunawardane asked the Foreign Minister to explain the details of the legal action being taken against General Jayasuriya and any other members of the Army, Ambassadors and members of the diplomatic corps in foreign countries.
He also asked the Government to reveal the actions being taken to protect the security forces in foreign countries.
Leader of the House Mr. Kiriella said the Government would answer the question in two weeks.
When the Opposition members objected saying that two weeks were not needed to answer the question, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the matter would be taken up at the party leaders? meeting tomorrow. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Syrian army breaks IS siege  on eastern city of Deir al-Zour
	
?
The Syrian army has reached an eastern city that has been besieged by Islamic State militants for nearly three years.
?The Syrian army breaks the siege imposed on Deir al-Zour,? Syrian television said.
The army reached the besieged Brigade 137 base, located at the south-western edge of the city.
?After 32 months of siege, the army managed to dismantle mines and open a corridor to reach its besieged forces, in the first move to lift the siege on the area,? Rami Abdel Rahman, the head of British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told dpa. Deir al-Zour, the main city in the Syrian province of the same name, has been almost entirely controlled by Islamic State since 2014.
Syrian troops, backed by ally Russia, have been advancing towards Deir al-Zour city on several fronts for several weeks, according to the London-based Observatory.
A Syrian military source requesting anonymity said the move is a step towards reaching the Deir al-Zour military airport, south-east of the city, adding that priority now to dismantle the mines.
Liberating Deir al-Zour completely will not be achieved before the opening of the international road from Sukhna, in the province of Homs, the source said.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad described the operation as a ?resounding victory? against ?the most dangerous terrorist organization on the face of earth,? according to the country?s official SANA news agency.
Mohammed Ibrahim al-Samara, the governor of Deir al-Zour, told dpa by phone that ?there are 70,000 civilians besieged in the Deir al-zour as well as 6,800 Syrian government troops.?
A resident from Deir al-Zour who refused to give his name said people under siege started to celebrate what he described ?as the initial victory.?
But the governor warned civilians against holding any celebratory gatherings out of fear that the Islamic State jihadists would shell the area.
Most of the province of Deir al-Zour is under the control of the Islamic State.
?There are 32 neighbourhoods inside the city, which are under the control of Islamic State and only four are under the regime control,? the resident added.

Tech-based solutions essential for insurance industry growth: start-up
	
?
Despite the fierce competition in the market, Sri Lanka?s insurance industry has largely remained conventional in its business operations for decades. Earlier this year, however, signs of an eminent disruption appeared with online insurance aggregators and comparison platforms entering the market. Save Your Monkey is one such pioneering insurtech start-up that?s promising to disrupt the conventional insurance industry through digitalization.?
The brainchild of three young entrepreneurs, saveyourmonkey.com was officially launched a month back with Sri Lanka?s first digital insurance agent, Amaya going trilingual.?
Save Your Monkey Founding Director and CEO Chathura Jayatissa shared his thoughts about what?s to be expected from the digital revolution in the insurance industry.?
??Insuretech start-ups primarily focus on the technological development of the insurance industry and we are one of the first in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka?s insurance industry has not experienced any disruption in a long time. So the idea was to ?Save Your Money? by creating a comparison platform where you can make an informed decision about your requirement. Through this platform we enabled our customers to compare, select and purchase insurance policies from the best insurers in the country at the convenience of their fingertips,? Jayatissa said explaining the concept of his venture.?
Jayatissa and his two colleagues, Amanda Jayatissa and Dhanushka Liyanage came up with the concept for saveyourmonkey.com a few years ago and have been slowly building up ever since.?
?The first tech solution we developed for our platform is Amaya, a chatbot that uses artificial intelligence components. A development like this is the first of its kind in this region. We are currently working on a few more cutting-edge innovations and are optimistic that some of these will create a great impact in insurance on a global or at least a regional level,? Jayatissa explained.
Talking about the potential of the idea and timeliness, Jayatissa points out that every industry is bound to be digitalized at some point. With the high penetration of mobile Internet in Sri Lanka, several industries such as transportation have been rapidly digitalized over the last few years and e-commerce has achieved a phenomenal growth.
?It is only a matter of time before the insurance industry would adapt to these changes as well and we are really excited to be on the forefront of this evolution. Digital solutions are essential for the industry to grow. For us it was all about correct timing and identifying when the market would be ready for this. So far, we believe we did it right.??
The insurance industry?s hesitance to adapt to new technology stems from a combination of different elements that vary from market-related factors to economic and social changes affecting customers. Being a highly competitive market, pricing is of utmost importance for companies, while the services and claims process is important to customers.?
??Insurtech start-ups can be instrumental in creating this much-needed balance between the two parties. As we move forward, we hope to further develop our platform with more features that will address these issues. One such feature is a rating/review system for insurance companies based on customer feedback. But this needs to be done over a period of time, making space for companies as well as customers to ease into these new changes. As an insurtech start-up, our job is to identify problems within the industry and develop tech solutions,?? says Jayatissa.
??However, we need to understand that technological innovations come from a good start-up environment. An environment that is encouraging towards start-ups is necessary. In Sri Lanka, start-ups have to literally ?start-up? against everything. As they slowly progress, we can hope to see a lot of things change in the industry,? he further added.
Procuring an insurance policy is a long process that starts with inquiring from insurance agents, friends and peers about the best option. One can easily avoid this hassle now by using saveyourmonkey.com. But what would be the guarantee that what you get is the best?
Jayatissa answers, ?Insurance policy pricing depends on a number of variables and we have made sure that our system has incorporated all these variables. We guarantee that Save Your Monkey rates are the best you can get in the market and if it isn?t we will match the price the customer receives from elsewhere. Also, we are providing an overall solution to a problem and also offer a lot of value additions to our service.?
For example, right now, we offer a discount for all insurance policies. We recently partnered with Nations Trust Bank American Express to offer zero percent interest instalment plans and on top of that up to 10 percent savings on regular days and up to 25 percent savings on special days. We keep adding partners almost every week to offer more value additions. Considering all this, we can guarantee that Save Your Monkey will soon be regarded the best place for insurance needs.?

TGTE welcomes SF?s statement that forces committed crimes
	
The Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE) on Tuesday welcomed the statement made by Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka that Sri Lankan security forces had committed war crimes against Tamils during and after the war ended.
Issuing a statement, the TGTE said ?confirmation of war crimes by Sri Lankan forces comes after eight years of denial by successive Sri Lankan Governments that no war crimes were committed and calling Sri Lankan forces ?War Heroes?.
?Sri Lankan Government rewarded ex-servicemen with senior Government positions, including appointing Field Marshal Fonseka as the Minister for Regional Development and General Jagath Jayasuriya as the Ambassador to Brazil,? the statement said.
It said Field Marshal Fonseka?s confession to war crimes committed by forces under his command came on September 1 and said that he has information about General Jayasuriya committing war crimes and that he is ready to give evidence.
?I know he committed Crimes and I am ready to testify before a proper investigation. He committed crimes during and after the end of the war. I have a lot of information,? the TGTE said quoting Minister Fonseka.
It said the minister went on to say that war crimes were committed even after the war ended.
?Minister Fonseka also said that he had information regarding other ?Officers who committed crimes?. We urge the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, UNHRC and others to act swiftly to bring perpetrators of these international crimes to face justice. UN should not miss this opportunity,? it said.

The opposition chief had given this call to the provincial one to advise him to defer the presentation of the controversial Amendment pending some revisions the government proposes to make in a bid to win the support of more members.?
So the provincial chief who readily accepted the Diyawanna opposition chief?s advice had deferred the process leading to taking a vote on the Amendment.?

They also warned that if the party remained fractured, the Blues may have to trail far behind others at the upcoming polls. ?Number One, however, did not want to get involved in an argument. He had called it a day after saying: ?Let us wait for the developments after?the 3rd.?

They even referred by name to some Betel leaf stalwarts at different purohita levels hailing from Colombo, Badulla and Galle districts as the villains of the piece.?
The Betel leaf delegates gave an attentive ear to the complaint by the visibly irate Green party ones. ?The reply they proffered finally showed that they were more worried about the issue than the Green ones. ?All that?s true?But we are quite helpless.

US-backed forces seize Raqqa?s Old City from ISIS, but a tough fight still lies ahead
	
?
By Liz Sly ? ??
(c) 2017, The Washington Post ? Sep 04, 2017 - ??
BEIRUT - U.S.-backed forces in Syria have captured the Old City of Raqqa, the latest milestone in their ongoing assault against the self-proclaimed capital of the Islamic State?s rapidly shrinking territories, according to a U.S. military statement on Monday. ??
?Kurdish and Arab fighters with the Syrian Democratic Forces secured the neighbourhood over the weekend after vanquishing a last pocket of resistance in the city?s historic Grand Mosque, the statement said. ??
?The capture followed a grinding two-month battle for the neighbourhood that has proved the toughest challenge yet of a three month old offensive for Raqqa, launched in June and still far from over. ??
?Unlike the Old City in Mosul, the one in Raqqa does not lie at the heart of the city and its seizure does not signify an imminent end to the fighting, said U.S. military spokesman Col. Ryan Dillon. ??
?The SDF now controls roughly 60 percent of Raqqa, said Dillon, who would not put a timeline on how long it would take to claim the rest but predicted that weeks of fighting lie ahead. ?
?
?He said it does however represent a ?significant step? in the overall battle for the city, which has turned into a block-by-block advance against a largely unseen enemy. ??
??This is still not over, it?s still going to be very difficult but we?re making progress,? he said. ??
?The Kurdish and Arab forces have been advancing simultaneously on multiple fronts, backed by U.S.-led airstrikes and accompanied by U.S. special operations forces, in an effort to stretch the resources of the defending militants. ??
?They are being met by barrages of improvised explosive devices and suicide bombers, many of them emerging behind SDF-lines from an extensive network of tunnels dug by the militants to defend the city. ??
?The United Nations says there are around 20,000 civilians trapped in the city, and as was the case in the battle for Mosul, they are bearing the brunt of the relentless airstrikes. Amnesty International said last month that hundreds of civilians had died in airstrikes since the offensive began, and said it had documented 176 deaths in June and July. ??
?The toughest battle is expected to be for a cluster of government buildings in the city center, known as the security block, where the Islamic State has prepared its heaviest defences. ??
?The advance in Raqqa coincides with significant gains by Syrian government forces further south on the outskirts of the city of Deir al-Zour, now the only major city in either Iraq or Syria that still is mostly under Islamic State control. Syrian army units backed by loyalist militias advanced to within six miles of a garrison of Syrian soldiers that has been besieged on the edge of the city for the past three years. ??
?The simultaneous advances by U.S.-backed and Syrian government forces on the two major cities of eastern Syria set up a potential scramble to control the rest of Deir al-Zour province, which is still mostly under Islamic State control. ??
?The commander of the U.S. led-coalition, Lt Gen Steven Townsend, said last week that the U.S. is preparing a force of Kurdish and Arab fighters to seize towns along the Euphrates River Valley in Deir al-Zour province where the Islamic State has been concentrating most of its manpower and resources.?

Utah hospital bars cops
	
?
?By Fred Barbash ??
(c) 2017, The Washington Post ? Sep 05, 2017 - ?
The University of Utah hospital where a nurse was manhandled and arrested by police as she protected the legal rights of a patient has imposed new restrictions on law enforcement, including barring officers from patient care areas and from direct contact with nurses. ?
Gordon Crabtree, interim chief executive of the hospital, said at a Monday news conference that he was ?deeply troubled? by the arrest and manhandling of burn unit nurse Alex Wubbels on July 26. In accord with hospital policy as well as the law, she had refused to allow a Salt Lake City police officer to take a blood sample from an unconscious patient. Wubbels obtained a copy of the body cam video of the confrontation and after consulting her lawyer, the hospital and police officials, released it last week. ?
?This will not happen again,? Crabtree said, praising Wubbels for ?putting her own safety at risk? to ?protect the rights of patients.? ?
Margaret Pierce, chief nursing officer for the University of Utah hospital system, said she was ?appalled? by the officer?s actions and has already implemented changes in hospital protocol to avoid any repetition. ?
She said police will no longer be permitted in patient care areas, such as the burn unit where Wubbels was the charge nurse on the day of the incident. ?
In addition, officers will have to deal with ?house supervisors? instead of nurses when they have a request. ?
This will guarantee that nurses devote themselves entirely to patient care without interruptions, she said, while other officials deal with police requests. ?
The incident, which has attracted nationwide attention in part thanks to the dramatic video, involved Detective Jeff Payne, who persisted in demanding a blood sample from an unconscious truck driver at the hospital who had earlier been involved in an accident stemming from police pursuit of a suspect. ?
Hospital policy, as well as the law in Utah and nationwide, requires police to have a warrant or permission from the patient to draw a blood sample in such circumstances. Payne had neither. ?
After Wubbels politely and repeatedly read hospital policy to him and had a supervisor back her up on a speakerphone connection, Payne snapped. He seized hold of the nurse, shoved her out of the building and cuffed her hands behind her back. A bewildered Wubbels screamed ?help me? and ?you?re assaulting me? as the detective forced her into an unmarked car and accused her of interfering with an investigation. ?
On Friday, the department said two of its employees had been placed on administrative leave, pending the results of an investigation, but did not give details. A criminal investigation is underway, according to Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill, and the city?s mayor and its police chief apologized to Wubbels in a statement.?

Vietnamese ship captain nabbed with illicit cigarettes
	
A captain of a Vietnamese ship had been arrested by Customs officers attached to the Port Control Unit last evening with cigarettes worth Rs. 6.6 million, Customs Deputy Director and Media Spokesman Sunil Jayarathne said.
During the investigation the Customs officers found 133, 980 sticks of foreign cigarettes branded ?LUFFMAN?.
?When a ship comes to a port, the captain should declare its goods to the port. In regard to this incident, the captain had not declare the cigarettes,? Mr. Jayarathne said.
However, the Customs intelligence had received a message saying the ship had cigarettes which had not been declared and they are selling them underhand. Later the Customs used a decoy to apprehend the captain,? he said.
The officers found the contraband hidden in the freezer room of the ship.
The Vietnamese Ship named MV THAI BINH 039 was arrived at the Colombo port from Vietnam with a load of cement, he said
The case was detected by the Assistant Customs Superintendent Indula Mahesh, Nissan Wanigasekara and Pulasthi Lakshan.
Investigations are carried out under the supervision of Deputy Customs Director K.B.A.Jayasooriya, A.R.Senadheera and Chief Preventive Officer.
After the Customs inquiry the cigarettes were forfeited and captain was fined Rs. 1,000,000 by the Customs. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

The district convention of the Blue party was held with much fanfare in the gem city recently. All party bigwigs and Diyawanna members from the district had been invited to the big event.?
?
It was the senior purohita functioning as the party?s district leader now about to take a seat in the opposition who organized the convention.?
Although the party?s big guns were invited as a matter of formality, the senior purohita wondered, the gem city being a bastion of the former strongman, whether they would get a hostile reception from the crowds at the event. So he met the party?s young secretarial one and told him: ?Although I have invited you, please don?t attend our convention. Because chances are that the crowds will greet you with boos and catcalls when you rise up to address the gathering.??
The young secretarial one heeding this advice kept away from the convention. The convention had been proceeding smoothly until another party big gun who attended the event made an acid remark about the former strongman which had drawn an instant hostile reaction from the crowds. However, he had immediately wound up his speech and quietly faded from the scene, they say.?

Women spread culture and knowledge around Europe 4,000 years ago
	
?
?(Daily Mail), 5 September 2017 - ?Women were the ?driving force? spreading new ideas and technologies across Britain and Europe during the Stone Age ? while their menfolk stayed home, a surprising new study has found. ?
Previous ideas of how our primitive ancestors travelled have been shaken by analysis of bones and teeth from ancient peoples. ?
They show that many females found buried in ancient burial grounds made long journeys to distant villages far from the homesteads where they were born and grew up.And as they did so they are thought to have carried culture and technology with them between 2,500 and 1,650 BC. ?One possibility is that the women were ?Queens of the Stone Age? - used to cement alliances between neighbouring tribes. ?
However, the women were not buried any differently to other women closely related to their menfolk ? suggesting they were of equal status to their local female neighbours. ?
