CPC TU strike unacceptable, says Minister
	
The indefinite strike announced by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Unions Collective on couldnt be justified and the demands were groundless, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody said today.
He said the Government had not taken any decision in favour of the China Bay Oil Tank Farm in Trincomalee.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror Minister Weerakkody said that the unions were not aware about the facts and therefore were making false allegations about the Oil Tank Farm and the Hambantota Port.
I have submitted a Cabinet Paper requesting permission to develop tanks in Hambantota in partnership with the CPC and the Sri Lanka Port Authority.
The Trincomalee tanks were given to India for 35 years at a cost of 100,000 USD per annum and the payment had been made for 15 years, he said.
He said that of the 99 tanks ten would be taken back, while the rest remain on a shared basis with the Lanka IOC and the CPC.
Therefore, Minister Weerakkody said what the unions were accusing the Government was ill-founded.
He said that however, that the demands of the TUs would be negotiated tomorrow.
Minister Weerakkody assured that so far no agreement had been closed regarding the oil tanks in Hambantota or Trincomalee and therefore the trade Unions should not create unnecessary fears among the general public. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Heat to continue, rains after May 1, says Met Dept.

The department therefore predicted a dry week and high speed winds in the North.

Temperatures in some areas were fairly high and it rose to 37.7C in Trincomalee while it was 33C average in other areas.

Long queues at filling points, fears of fuel scarcity
	
Motorists were seen queuing up at filling stations in Colombo to refuel their vehicles fearing a possible fuel shortage due to the planned strike by petroleum workers.
Speaking to Daily Mirror some filling station owners said that they were not aware of a trade union action being launched but confirmed that no fuel tankers had arrived to replenish their fuel stocks today and acknowledged that this could potentially lead to a fuel shortage in next day or two.
However, they assured the public that they would continue to supply fuel to motorists for as long as they have stocks and they hoped that the fuel tankers would arrive some time soon and avoid a fuel scarcity in the Island.
Daily Mirror correspondents confirmed that the phenomenon was not an isolated issue but common to other areas as well with Galle, Matara, Kandy, Kurunegala as well as Kalutara also reporting long queues with motorists filling up their tanks in fear of a fuel shortage in the coming days.

MH370: New analysis reiterates plane's likely location
	
Fresh evidence suggests that Malaysia Airlines flight 370 is most likely located to the north of a main search zone, Australian scientists say.
MH370 disappeared while flying to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board in 2014.
Australia, Malaysia and China called off their hunt for the jet in January.
Analysing drift modelling of a real Boeing 777 wing part for the first time, scientists backed a December report about MH370's likely location.
That location is an area of approximately 25,000 sq km (9,700 sq miles) lying north of the earlier search zone in the southern Indian Ocean.
"Testing an actual flaperon [wing part] has added an extra level of assurance to the findings from our earlier drift modelling work," said Dr David Griffin, from Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).
Earlier modelling had used replicas of a flaperon recovered from Reunion Island, the report said.
"We've found that an actual flaperon goes about 20 degrees to the left, and faster than the replicas, as we thought it might," Dr Griffin said.
"The arrival of MH370's flaperon at La Reunion in July 2015 now makes perfect sense."
Last year, Australia's Transport Minister Darren Chester said the December report would not be grounds for a new search because it did not give a "specific location" for the aircraft.
Speaking on Friday, he reiterated that position but said the report had been sent to Malaysia for consideration.
"Malaysia is the lead investigator and any future requests in relation to searching for MH370 would be considered by Australia, at that time."(BBC)

MR: Fill Galle Face on May Day
	
Former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa called on the people to bring the Government to its knees by thronging in thousands to the Galle Face Green on the May Day where the Joint Opposition is scheduled to hold its May Day Rally.
Speaking at the gathering called "Jayanada commemoration" to felicitate Western Provincial Council member Gunasiri Jayanath on his completion of twenty years as a people's representative on Saturday, Mr. Rajapaksa said that the Government had given the Galle Face Green to the Joint Opposition for the May Day rally presuming that the rally would be a ridiculous flop.
"But we must show them our strength," he called on the people.
He charged that the only thing that the Government had done for the past two and a half years, was going round the country making vile allegations against his Government. Apart from this the Government had planned to sell out the country during the past two years, he said.
Comparing the present Government and his regime the former President stated that he had brought the war to an end within the first three years of his tenure and built highways and hospitals, introduced new subjects to the school curriculum and supplied electricity for 98 percent of the population.
"That was the difference between my Government and the Yahapalanaya Government. Had we also been intoxicated with hatred like these people, one could imagine where the country would have been now."
Commenting on the last week's Gazette notification issued by President Maithripala Sirisena declaring garbage disposal as an essential service, he said it was only water, electricity and health that had been declared as essential services so far whereas garbage had been declared as an essential service for the first time.
He also charged that the Government was acting in a highhanded manner ignoring even court rulings.
The former President accused that the Government was planning to bring in a law enabling the soldiers, who protected the country and the people to be hauled before courts on charges levelled even by foreigners. (Sudath Pubudu Keerthi)

SLFP should not be abandoned during its difficult time: Nimal
	
Even though the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was having a difficult time, it was not worth abandoning for short term benefits, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva today said.
While addressing a SLFP electorate meeting held at the Badulla Postal Auditorium, the Minister made the above remark and said the party should be saved for long term rather than following short term advantages.
There were times we lost elections and lost our positions, however, we survived and we were able to protect the party. Each and every single member has a shared responsibility to safeguard the SLFP. Even though there are some misgivings we should work towards the betterment of the party, he said.
Minister Siripala also said creating a new political party was not an answer to resolve the matters. He stressed that whatever the issue, it should be solved within the party. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
