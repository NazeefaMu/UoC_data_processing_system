Construction of two domestic airports to commence this year
	
The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation said yesterday that construction work on two out of four proposed domestic airports would be commenced this year in Bandarawela and Palavi.
Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva visited the Nayabadda Estate in Bandarawela where one of airports is to be constructed.
The airport, with a run-way length of 1.5km and a width of 20 metres, is to be constructed at a cost of Rs.1.3 billion. It would also include a small terminal building and a controlling tower. The construction is expected to be completed within a year.
The airport will be built on about 75 acres of an abandoned land which belongs to the Janatha Estate Development Board and will have a capacity of a maximum of 45 passenger aircrafts.
The feasibility report will be finalized after the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) visits the location for inspection.
Earlier it was decided to build an airport in Haputale, but due to technical reasons it was decided to shift the venue to Bandarawela.
The Ministry expects to construct four domestic airports in Kandy, Palavi, Trincomalee and Bandarawela.
Once the construction of the airports is completed, they would be operated under a publicprivate partnership, the ministry said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Danuna Thilakaratne, the son-in-law of Minister Sarath Fonseka, today lodged a complaint with the Human Rights Commission (HRC) against Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, claiming that the minister had refused to release the monies that were contained in his bank accounts that were frozen as a result of him being named as a suspect in a case brought against Hi-Corp, even after he was acquitted.
Mr. Thilakaratne said he had made a request from Minister Rajapakshe to release the funds that were contained in his personal bank accounts that were frozen as he had been acquitted from the case but the minister had not responded to his request so far.
The case in question was filed against me by the previous regime on false charges and it went on for five years during the time the previous government was in power and went on for one year after that. I have been acquitted from the case now but my personal bank accounts are still frozen. I have requested the Justice Minister to release them on several occasions but he has not responded. As a result it is my position that my fundamental rights have been violated, he said.
Danuna Tilakaratne was acquitted from the controversial Hi-Corp case last year. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Govt. cannot be toppled: President
	
President Maitripala Sirisena, while noting today that the Government was stable, said there was no crisis in the SLFP but only a clash between a group of rogues and those who were committed to taking forward Bandaranaikes policies and principles forward.
Speaking to Newspaper Editors and Media institution heads at the Presidents House, he said that if anyone thought of toppling the Government it would only be an unfulfilled dream.
He said that there was no way that the present Parliaments composition can be changed in a conspiratorial manner to form a different government.
The UNF has 108 and the UPFA 95. Therefore no one clearly has 113. If someone is making a new Government in a conspiratorial manner, without the consent of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and without my blessings, they should show 113 in Parliament.
To show that 113 they should begin with the UPFA. Can they get the entire 95 They cant. Then lets say they can at least take 50 from that 95. Then they need another 63 to show the 113. Those seats they have to gather from the UNP, JVP or the TNA. I know that the members of the JVP and the TNA will not come to topple this Government. Then they have to get the seats from the UNP. The Governments have been toppled earlier but I have never seen it happening in such numbers ever. Then it has to be a miracle. There wont be crossovers in 30, 40, 50 or 60 in numbers. Therefore it cannot happen, he said.

He is just doing my bidding!
	
The Betel leaf party now reorganising the party at the grassroots level held a meeting in an upcountry area recently. The newly elected secretarial one chaired the meeting. 

A large group of party activists from Matale area was conspicuous by their noisy presence at this meeting. True to a pattern that had been faithfully followed at a series of previous party meetings, a section of the gathering loyal to the former strongman, began raising ruckus here too.
The secretarial one who had the advantage of having experienced similar situations before was ready to face situation. 
He first asked the media personnel to leave the hall for a short while, and told the noisy protesters that he was prepared to take them into confidence if they were prepared to listen to him and that gesture of goodwill quietened them.
And now he addressed them: We all have to unite. Otherwise, there will be no future for the party. Dont take seriously hard-hitting statements our colleagues make from public platforms We have to say certain things which our high ups want us to say.
At this stage a vociferous activist directed a question at him. Okay, let be what you say! But why is that foul-mouthed one from Badulla saying nasty things about our Lokka and the confidants of his former regime
The secretarial one in the chair greeted this question with a tell-tale smile and proceeded to give his answer: Dont take seriously what the Badulla man says. He says what I ask him to say!
And they accepted this secret with a solemn silence.

Malinga acted against medical advice- Dr. Siri Kannangara
	
Injured pacer Lasith Malinga is believed to have acted against the medical advice given by another Sri Lankan doctor (now based in Australia) Siri Kannangara.
Speaking exclusively over his mobile from Australia on Tuesday evening, Dr. Kannangara said, I had examined Malinga in January during my two trips in Sri Lanka and had advised him to take minimum six-months rest. This six-month period can still exceed. The period is still not over now and I wonder why he chose to play in the Asia Cup. 
Malinga, had played one match against UAE (at Mirpur) in February-- the very next month after the advice was given to him by the specialist and may have aggrarated the injury.
Doctor Kannangara said had Malinga listened to his advice, he may have been on a better recovery path.
I had prescribed him a few Intra-Vein injections (not cortisone). I dont know whether Malinga did take these injections or consulted any other doctor and decided to play. 
That was his decision and I cant comment on this, he added.
Dr. Kannangara is likely to arrive in Sri Lanka next month before going to London.
I will not advise Malinga unless and until my advice is sought, by him doctor clarified.
Dr. Kannangara has treated a few international cricketers including Indias Sachin Tendulkar.
Sri Lankan pacer Chaminda Vaas had advised Tendulkar to consult me and I treated him for his back pain.
Viv and Barry Richards, Clive Lloyd and many other ex-players have been successfully treated by Dr. Siri Kannangara. 
Meanwhile, the report on Lasith Malingas fitness has been submitted to the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) board by three specialists.
According to the sources in Colombo, the three experts-Dr. Harindu Wijesinghe, Prof. Arjuna de Silva and Dr. Thushantha Wijesinghe are unanimous in their report, which suggests that the 33-year-old pace bowler needs rest and no specific treatment but regular monitoring by the physio and trainer.

Pan Asia Bank launches Saviya microfinance loan scheme
	

Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC, Sri Lankas fastest growing commercial bank, took yet another giant step towards promoting sustainable financial inclusion with their recent launch of Saviya microfinance loan scheme.
This loan scheme is designed to assist development of livelihood for prospective entrepreneurs who remain largely overlooked by the mainstream conventional banking. The reason for introducing this scheme is our belief that in Sri Lankas economic growth story, there is a pivotal role to be played by small enterprises engaged in industries such as agriculture, live stock development, fisheries, and other small enterprises. As such, it is our duty and responsibility as a successful local bank to empower small scale entrepreneurs by making credit facilities available to them at their hour of need commented Naleen Edirisinghe, DGM Retail Banking & SME of Pan Asia Bank.
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony held recently at Pan Asia Bank Embilipitiya branch granting the first Saviya loan, Naleen Edirisinghe stated that We are extremely happy to launch this special loan scheme, bringing credit, savings and other essential financial services within the reach of millions of people who still remain overlooked by most financial institutions, due to their inability to offer sufficient collateral. This void prompted Pan Asia Bank to venture out to serve this segment of population in Sri Lanka by providing credit facilities based primarily on the banks evaluation of the applicants vocation and its confidence in the success of the enterprise rather than the collateral. Saviya loan scheme also aims to promote a savings culture among these customers and thereby strengthening their financial position he further added. Supplementing the Saviya loan scheme, is an investment-based savings scheme where it is mandatory for the borrowers to contribute an additional agreed amount every month towards a savings build up which could be used as collateral for any future expansion of business activity.
The bank also permits group loans against the cross guarantees where maximum number of borrowers in each group to be 5 nos. The minimum value of such loans will be Rs.25,000 and the value granted will vary depending on the requirement considering the past track record of the particular borrower.
We expect to further expand the Saviya loan scheme to cater to a wider section of the targeted market segment such as small scale agriculturists, cultivators and milk farmers who already maintain supplier linkages, added Edirisinghe.

The political authority handling posts and telecommunications the other day sent for the head of the biggest department coming under his purview.

The department head who dutifully appeared before the political authority, found the secretarial one of the Ministry too was seated opposite him.
The political authority was in an ugly mood because the department head had been found remiss in carrying out certain instructions issued by him, and he wanted to teach the white collar one a lesson. The dialogue that ensued ran as follows:
Political authority: Why dont you carry out my instructions
Department Head: I did all I could do and didnt do what I could not and should not do. Thats the truth, Sir.
Things you couldnt do You cannot do whatever we ask you to doBut you happily carried out whatever the purohita of the previous regime asked you to do. When we ask you to do something, you throw the law books at us. I know well how things were going on in those days. If you eagerly carried out orders at that time, why are you adopting a different attitude now
Governments may change, Sir, but we cant change the way of doing things to suit those in power. As a matter of fact, the political authority and the secretary of the previous regime never asked us to do anything illegal. They never issued instructions that ran counter to the law either. They asked us to do things we could do and we happily did those things!
Do you say that we are giving you wrong instructions and asking you to do things you should not do
All I can say is that I have always carried out all your instructions legally okay...
Well, I did not send for you to have an argument with youIll see what I can doNow you may go!

This purohita who once held high office in the Green Party went on pilgrimage to India and Nepal recently. During his pilgrimage to the Himalayan State where the Buddha was born, he called on a well-known Nadi-vakya soothsayer to get a reading of his political future and the outcome of several pending court cases against him.

And the soothsayer made a prediction that was music to his ears: That with the ending of the Erashtaka malefic period by March next year, he will not only get a seat in the august assembly; he will be also raised to purohita status. The politico had asked the soothsayer how he could look forward to purohita status given that he is no longer a member of the assembly and the general poll is about four year away.
The soothsayer had replied: I cant explain to you how you will become a member of the assembly. But I can assure you that they will confer on you such high office that you have never dreamt of. And it is going to be a certainty as the sun-rise in the morning! The soothsayer had also requested the politico not to forget to inform him of his good fortune, when his prediction comes true!
Despite the prediction being too good to be true, the politico is said to be taking heart from the fact that the credentials of the soothsayer have never been challenged in the country where he practices!

Addressing a press briefing held at the Opposition leaders office to clarify allegation that the Opposition Leader had entered an Army camp forcibly, Mr. Sumanthiran said it was the Army that was illegally occupying the private properties in the area.
An inquiry should not be held into, why the Opposition Leader entered the land. Instead an inquiry should be held as to why the Army was occupying that land, he said.
He said 88 families were living in the area and had left during the war and the Army had occupied the lands since 2009.
34 families were able to go back to their properties; the remaining 54 families are unable to go back to their homes because the Army was occupying the properties. So, if there is any discussion with regard to illegality or force, it has been perpetrated by the Army. Not by the Opposition Leader, he said.
The Opposition Leader had had visited Kilinochchi on the invitation of said 54 families, who claimed the Army did not allow them to resettle on their lands.
The Opposition Leader and several MPs had gone to the area and the persons, who were at the entrance had opened the barricade without any question and had allowed them to enter, he said.
The land, which is being occupied by the Army is not a State land, it is a private land. If the Army wants to occupy the land there is a procedure. People are being made to believe that the Opposition Leader had forcibly entered the land. It is wrong. This did not happen, the MP said.
Mr. Sumanthiran said that there was no need for the Army to continue to occupy private property with the end of the war.
He said the Army had only acquired about 5 acres. There were more than 20 acres which is still private.
It is wrong to give a picture that there were some Army camp of some High Security on State land. It is not correct. There is no Army camp. Only people's houses are there, he said.
He said the Opposition Leader had met the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday morning and discussed the matter.
The Prime Minister assured that he would call for a report from the Army on the matter, he said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

UPFA to refrain from inviting MR for SLFP rally
	
The UPFA has decided against inviting former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to the SLFP May Day rally at Galle, personally, as he continues to be-little the partys official May Day rally, UPFA General Secretary, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Minister Amaraweera said the SLFP did not invite party members formally to the May Day rally but assigned them on various duties related to the rally in addition to asking them to bring as many supporters as possible to the main rally. But constituent partners of the UPFA have been invited.
However, as Mr. Rajapaksa is a former President, former party leader and a patron of the SLFP we sent him an e-mail and a fax inviting him to the May Day rally. I wanted to meet him and hand over the invitation personally out of respect. But I have now decided not to do so as it seems that there is no end to disparaging remarks and insinuations on the SLFP led by President Maithripala Sirisena, he said.
He alleged that Mr. Rajapaksa stooped to the level of engaging former Pradeshiya Sabha chairmen to insult the party and widen the division within.
Minister Amaraweera vowed that he would bring 124 buses fully loaded with SLFP supporters from Hambantota for the SLFP rally in Galle and added he could not find supporters to fill 4 buses from Hambantota for the 2015 SLFP May Day rally held at Hyde Park, Colombo.
Commenting on the EUs declared consent to lift the ban on fish exports on Sri Lanka, Minister Amaraweera said Sri Lanka could resume export of fish and related products to EU in two months, after going through EU Parliament and the approval procedure.
Sri Lanka has incurred a loss of foreign exchange to the value of Rs.1,600 million annually as a result of the EU fish exports ban. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

We try to protect SLFP: Joint opp.
	
Joint Opposition Chief Organiser and MP Dullas Alahapperuma said today that their May Day rally would be in the best interest of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) since their intention is to protect the SLFP from the United National Party (UNP) led Government.
Peoples mandate was given to the SLFP/UPFA to create a separate government and not a coalition with the UNP.
Therefore, the Joint Opposition May Day rally will be in the best interest of the SLFP and not against it. We invite all who are against the UNP, SLFP coalition to attend the Kirulapone rally. We intent no harm to the SLFP, our sole intention is to protect it and its principles, he told a news conference held at the Dr. N. M. Perera Centre.
The MP said the SLFP principles were completely against that of the UNP and focused more on progressive, humanitarian aspects and working people. Therefore, we dont think holding the May Day rally against the UNP would be considered as an offense by the party, he said.
He said that there were three factions in the SLFP -one in the Joint Opposition and two factions in the Government-and said one SLFP faction in the Government led by former president Chandrika Kumaratunga was hell-bent on breaking away, despite the other SLFP factions attempt to create unity among the factions.
