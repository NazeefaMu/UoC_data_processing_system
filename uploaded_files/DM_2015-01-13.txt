	A two-seater aircraft was found today at the Narahenpita Economic Centre following a tip off by phone to the 119 call centre, police said.
	When we tried to contact the managing director of the Asian Aviation Centre regarding reports that the aircraft belonged to them, Ms. Nihara Jayathilaka answered and said the aircraft was in a dilapidated condition and had been gifted to Yoshitha Rajapaksa on a written document following his request.
	The following is a transcript of the conversation with Ms. Jayathilaka:Q. Is the report true that the light aircraft which was found at the Narahenpita Economic Centre belonged to youA. Yes. It was an old, dilapidated one which is unusable. We used it for several years after it was assembled. Later on it was used only for exhibitions.Q. Did you sell it or was it a giftA. It does not have any financial value. It is just an attraction. One day Yoshitha came and asked my husband, Uncle, can I have it and we gave it to him. It is an unusable one.Q. How did the people at the Economic Centre come to know that it belonged to youA. We gave it with a letter. So it must have been there. Two days ago someone from the Economic Centre phoned me and asked whether I could help dismantle it and I sent some of our technicians and that is how it came to public knowledge. There is nothing to panic about.
	Narahenpita Police had received information that certain people were trying to take away a two-seater aircraft which was at the Narahenpita Economic Centre and found a dilapidated aircraft at the location last evening.
	Narahenpita Police are investigating the incident. (Ajith Siriwardana)Video by Sanath Desmond

Mini Budget on Jan. 29
	
	The Mini-Budget of the new Governments 100-day programme will be presented in Parliament on January 29 with a relief package for the people as promised in the run-up to the presidential election, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said today.
	The Mini-Budget of the new Governments 100-day programme will be presented in Parliament on January 29 with a relief package for the people as promised in the run-up to the presidential election, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said today.
	He said while increasing the salaries of public servants, a mechanism would be introduced to increase the salaries of private sector employees who make up 83 per cent of the work force.
	After assuming duties at his office at the Government Treasury complex yesterday, the minister said the mini budget would also contain proposals to reduce prices on 10 essential commodities including fuel.
	The people gave a mandate to this government to bring about a palpable change in the system of governance and for a stable economic which was drifting aimlessly. The people demanded that their tax burden be reduced because state revenue was being used for unproductive purposes. On the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena and of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe I have been tasked to put an end to corruption and mismanagement at the Treasury with the assistance of Treasury Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga and other Treasury officials, the minister said.
	He said this government was under a capable and professional leadership and was not a one-man show. We are committed to eliminating the feudal system which had existed up to now. 
	The minister said the Maithripala administration was not looking at minimising corruption but at eliminating it fully.
	Therefore, acts such bribery, obtaining huge commissions between 20% and 50% and other forms of corruption will not be tolerated under any circumstance. Corrupt officials will be severely dealt with irrespective of their political affiliation and status. Officials need not be subservient to anyone under this administration, he said.
	The new government of President Miathripala Sirisena has vowed to be transparent and subjected to checks and balances.
	We criticised the Rajapaksa regime while in the opposition and now it is our turn to practice what we preached, the minister said. The economy has collapsed. We have decided to carry out an audit inquiry to know the real financial situation of the country. I hope we will be able to know in a week. Investors have stopped coming to Sri Lanka and the immediate priority is to build confidence and motivate them to invest in Sri Lanka. What we must do is not to destroy but create, the minister said. The Maithripala Government is made up of all communities and under its administration there will be no discrimination against Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Burghers or Malays. Decisions on all matters will be taken collectively and not by one or two people. We are on a journey to become the most vibrant and booming economy in South Asia. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Video: It is the misfortune of the people - Gammanpila
	
	Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila yesterday said that Maithripala Sirisena has been elected as the president of Sri Lanka for the misfortune of the people of the country.
	I predicted this long before at a press briefing. I decided to defect from the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) because I didnt want to take part in any separatist agenda. Even the General Secretary of the MDMK in Tamil Nadu, Vaiko had celebrated the defeat of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Vaiko said the poll day was the happiest day of his life, Mr. Gammanpila said.
	He said that it was the first time in history that someone has been elected as the President of the country without a majority of votes from the main ethnic group.
	All the other elected presidents had gained the majority votes from the main ethnic group. We dont see the election results as a down fall of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance or as a defeat, he said.
	Commenting on the newly formed government, Mr. Gammanpila said it has opted to go for a hundred-day programme and then to go for a general election on April 23 after dissolving the Parliament.
	We have decided to give our maximum support to implement the hundred-day programme and after the programme, we will demand for a parliamentary election. We have only 97 more days to wait. We assure that we will form a patriotic government soon, he said. 
	However, he said the country would face a massive economic crisis if the new government went ahead with the hundred-day programme.
	He said though the former President has not given the approval, the UPFA was on the stance of fielding Mr. Rajapaksa against Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe for the Prime Minister post at the general election.
	Mahinda and Ranils face to face combat will come on stage in April once again, Mr. Gammanpila said.
	Meanwhile Mr.Gammanpila said he and his wife Dinesha Gammanpila have in a complaint to the Borella Police said they had received death threats over the phone and that even their children would be harmed unless they left the country after abandoning the PHU Party.
	I and my wife received death threats on our mobile phone numbers 0714437681, 0717172896 and 0724698967 and as such we complained to Borella police. The complaint number is CIB (1) 251/136. Rumours were being spread through the social media before the presidential election that we had already sent our family members abroad and were planning to leave the country on January 8, Mr. Gammanpila said.
	He said it was clearly evident that we would be not in a position to take an active part in the political arena in this country.
	I hope President Sirisena who was elected to office on the promise of good governance and a compassionate era would take appropriate steps against the politicians who are behind those who are making these threats, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

His Holiness Pope Francis arrived at the Bandaranaike International Airport, Katunayake at 8.45 am.
The Pope has a busy first day, including meetings with the country's bishops and representatives of the country's major religious groups.
He is expected to call for greater dialogue among the country's Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Catholics amid a surge in anti-Muslim violence by fundamentalist Buddhists.
On Wednesday, Francis will canonise Sri Lanka's first saint, the Reverend Giuseppe Vaz, a 17th century missionary credited with having revived the Catholic faith among both Sinhalese and Tamils amid persecution by Dutch colonial rulers, who were Calvinists.
Later in the day he will fly to Madhu Church, to pray at a shrine beloved by both Sinhalese and Tamil faithful.
On Thursday he heads to the Philippines, the largest Roman Catholic country in Asia and third-largest in the world, for the second and final leg of the journey.Pix by Pradeep Pathirana

UPFA MP Sajin de Vass Gunawardena had produced a licence for the elephant to prove the legality of the elephant that was in his custody, Hikkaduwa Park Warden Asanga Gunawardene, who carried out the inspection told the media.
He said wildlife officials would carry out further investigations to ascertain the authenticity of the licence.
A team of officials of the Wildlife Conservation Department had yesterday raided the residence of UPFA MP Sajin de Vass Gunawardena at Ambalangoda in search of an elephant.
Meanwhile, some of the people who were guarding the gate and the police prevented the media from covering the incident. They questioned the police why the media should be obstructed if the parliamentarian was not involved in an illegal act. They pointed out that the elephant was being cared for by a private veterinary surgeon.
Meanwhile Balapitiya UNP Chief Organiser and Attorney Kamal Jayantha De Soysa and Pradeshiya Sabha Member Ushantha Mendis requested for permission to enter the premises to watch the officials carrying out the inspection, but to no avail.
He told the media that the UPFA parliamentarian had only owned a motorcycle had in a very short time amassed wealth to become a billionaire and that it would be investigated within a couple of weeks. He said the parliamentarian concerned was facing serious allegations.(Hemantha de Silva)

Lankans must accept to learn to live as one family: Pope
	
Pope Francis who arrived in the country this morning said that he hoped every word and action of Sri Lankan political and religious leaders will make a lasting contribution to the material and spiritual progress of all the Sri Lankans.
Speaking at the Bandaranaike International Airport upon his arrival, the Pope said that promoting human dignity and respect for human rights was also essential as well as improving infrastructures and material needs. 
The great work of rebuilding must embrace improving infrastructures and meeting material needs, but also, and even more importantly, promoting human dignity, respect for human rights, and the full inclusion of each member of society, he said. 
He said thatthe diversity was no longer seen as a threat, but as a source of enrichment and therefore people of Sri Lanka must be prepared to accept one another, to respect legitimate diversities, and learn to live as one family. 
Whenever people listen to one another humbly and openly, their shared values and aspirations become all the more apparent, he said.
Commenting on the civil war and its aftermath, the Pope saidhe was convinced that the followers of the various religious traditions have an essential role to play in the process of reconciliation and rebuilding which is taking place in the island.Speech of His Holiness Pope Francis

	Mr. President,
	Honourable Government Authorities,
	Your Eminence, Your Excellencies,
	Dear Friends,
	I thank you for your warm welcome. I have looked forward to this visit to Sri Lanka and these days which we will spend together. Sri Lanka is known as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean for its natural beauty. Even more importantly, this island is known for the warmth of its people and the rich diversity of their cultural and religious traditions.
	Mr. President, I extend to you my best wishes for your new responsibilities. I greet the distinguished members of the government and civil authorities who honour us by their presence. I am especially grateful for the presence of the eminent religious leaders who play so important a role in the life of this country. And of course, I would like to express my appreciation to the faithful, the members of the choir, and the many people who helped make this visit possible. I thank you all, from the heart, for your kindness and hospitality.
	My visit to Sri Lanka is primarily pastoral. As the universal pastor of the Catholic Church, I have come to meet, encourage and pray with the Catholic people of this island. A highlight of this visit will be the canonization of Blessed Joseph Vaz, whose example of Christian charity and respect for all people, regardless of ethnicity or religion, continues to inspire and teach us today. But my visit is also meant to express the Churchs love and concern for all Sri Lankans, and to confirm the desire of the Catholic community to be an active participant in the life of this society.
	It is a continuing tragedy in our world that so many communities are at war with themselves. The inability to reconcile differences and disagreements, whether old or new, has given rise to ethnic and religious tensions, frequently accompanied by outbreaks of violence. Sri Lanka for many years knew the horrors of civil strife, and is now seeking to consolidate peace and to heal the scars of those years. It is no easy task to overcome the bitter legacy of injustices, hostility and mistrust left by the conflict. It can only be done by overcoming evil with good (cf. Rom 12:21) and by cultivating those virtues which foster reconciliation, solidarity and peace. The process of healing also needs to include the pursuit of truth, not for the sake of opening old wounds, but rather as a necessary means of promoting justice, healing and unity.
	Dear friends, I am convinced that the followers of the various religious traditions have an essential role to play in the delicate process of reconciliation and rebuilding which is taking place in this country. For that process to succeed all members of society must work together; all must have a voice. All must be free to express their concerns, their needs, their aspirations and their fears. Most importantly, they must be prepared to accept one another, to respect legitimate diversities, and learn to live as one family. Whenever people listen to one another humbly and openly, their shared values and aspirations become all the more apparent. Diversity is no longer seen as a threat, but as a source of enrichment. The path to justice, reconciliation and social harmony becomes all the more clearly seen.
	In this sense, the great work of rebuilding must embrace improving infrastructures and meeting material needs, but also, and even more importantly, promoting human dignity, respect for human rights, and the full inclusion of each member of society. It is my hope that Sri Lankas political, religious and cultural leaders, by measuring their every word and action by the good and the healing it will bring, will make a lasting contribution to the material and spiritual progress of the Sri Lankan people.
	Mr President, dear friends, I thank you once again for your welcome. May these days we spend together be days of friendship, dialogue and solidarity. I invoke an abundance of Gods blessings upon Sri Lanka, the Pearl of the Indian Ocean, and I pray that its beauty may shine forth in the prosperity and peace of all its people.
