AGRICULTURAL COMPANY : ALLEGEDLY ENCROACHES ON FOREST LANDS
	

The forest conservation officers had gone to courts, but actions to eject them were not carried out
	It is the responsibility of the Director General of Department of Conservation to find out why no action was taken
	During September- October months in 2010 Dole Lanka Company had obtained electricity


The Director General of Forest Conservation S.A. Hathurusinghe alleges that Dole Lanka (Pvt) Ltd a subsidiary of the reputed American Company Dole International and Nelna Private Company together had unlawfully acquired 800 Hectares of Forest Land in the Moneragala District belonging to the Department of Forest Conservation.

Dole Lanka and Nelna Companies continually rejected this position over the past ten years, but as a result of a court action it has come to light that these lands belong to the Department of Forest Conservation.
The Director General of the Department of Forest Conservation alleges that Dole Lanka Company had acquired 400 Hectares from the Government forest reservation in Kuda Oya Grama Seva Division, coming under the Moneragala, Wellawaya Divisional Secretariat, and 200 Hectares from the Demodera forest conservation in Rahathangama Grama Seva Division, in the Buttala Divisional Secretariat. In addition local Nelna Private Company had acquired 200 Hectares from the Wandama Forest Conservation in the Rahathangama grama Seva Division, for the cultivation of mangoes.
Dole Lanka and its agents had established this agricultural project in the Moneragala District in the year 2008. At the beginning the company had cleared an area of 20 Hectares in the elephant infested jungle area in Wandama bordering the Lunugamwehera National Park. The records available at the Department of Forest Conservation reveal that this company had acquired 320.04 Hectares within two years of starting operations. The forest conservation officers had gone to courts, but actions to eject them were not carried out using the act of re-vesting government lands which had aroused suspicion (Annexure 01). At, at the time, the then Moneragala District Forest Officer addressed a letter dated 07/12/2010 to the Zonal Deputy Conservator of Forests, with a copy to their head office in Colombo, seeking instructions for granting these two blocks of land to the relevant company for agricultural activities. The District Forest Officer had failed in keeping his senior officers aware of Dole Lanka Ltd companys continual acquisitions of land. This had been revealed in an investigation conducted by the Department of Forest Conservation regarding this matter.
With a view to regularise the acquisition of forest lands from 2008 by Dole Lanka Pvt Ltd Company, they had in writing requested on 01/06/2010 from the Director General of Department of Forest Conservation to grant them 300 Hectares from the Wandama Kuda Oya area and another 150 Hectares from the Wandama Demodera area in Wellawaya.
This request had been made through Ranabima Private Company of 16th Mile Post Raja Mawatha Buttala. Accordingly the Senior Deputy Conservator of Forests (Controller Planning and Progress ) attaching a copy of the request by the company sought a report from the then Moneragala District Forest officer by his letter dated 16/06/2010 Reference PM/08/0214/14. In response to this letter the Moneragala District Forest Officer had called for a report from the then Wellawaya Forest Range Officer. Subsequently the Moneragala District Forest Officer had by letter dated 07/12/2010 and carrying reference MD/2/4/2010 recommended that 450 hectares belonging to the Department of Forest Conservation to be given to Dole Lanka Company.
Following this directive of the District Forest Officer, Senior Deputy Conservator of Forests (Planning & Progress Control) S.A.D. Kingsley had subjected the land acquired by Dole Lanka Company to an observation. The senior Deputy Conservator of Forests (Planning & Progress Control) had informed the then District Forest Officer and Ranabima Private Company that the Director General of Department of Forest Conservation had decided to grant, out of the two lands Dole Lanka Company had requested, 200 Hectares of land from Demodara area in the Grama Niladhari Division of Buttala Rahathangama in Wandama Demaliya forest belonging to the Government to Dole Lanka Company.
This is confirmed by his letter dated 03/01/2011 under reference number P/M/08/02/14/14. However Dole Lanka Company had acquired a further 18.08 Hectares in addition to the land already granted. This is shown in the Tracing number MO/BTT/2013/358 provided by the Moneragala Superintendent of Surveys. Despite all these facts it is shown from the letter dated 06/07/2011 under reference DLUPO/20/13/01 addressed by the Moneragala District Secretary to the District Land use Committee that this land under question had been referred to them and directives had been obtained. During our investigations it was found that with regard to the 200 Hectares in Kuda Oya area belonging to the Wellawaya District Secretaries Division which had been acquired by Dole Lanka Company, the Director General of Department of Forest Conservation had not given any directives.


Improper orders
Much before the Director General of Conservation of Forests released this block of land to Dole Lanka Company and the Survey Department of Sri Lanka had on the orders of Buttala and Wellawaya Divisional secretaries conducted a survey of 218.08 Hectares in Demodara Crown lands in Wandama and Demaliya areas and made tracings.
This position is shown by the following documents:-
The order to conduct the survey by the Buttala divisional secretary dated 18/06/2013 carrying reference BU/ LND/01/RLTAP 27 and survey order Number 1601.
The Superintendent of Surveys Tracing carrying reference MO/ BTT/2013/353
The plan No 3957 prepared by Surveyor S.P. Rathnayake on the instructions of the Wellawaya Divisional Secretary dated 17/02/2010 reference number <U+0DC0><U+0DD0>/3/5/<U+0DB6><U+0DAF><U+0DD4>/14
It is the responsibility of the Director General of Department of Conservation to find out why no action was taken, by the then forest officers, when Wellawaya and Buttala Divisional Secretaries had resorted to the preparation of Tracings on surveys conducted on Forest Lands belonging to the Forest Conservation. It should be found and whether this happened with their knowledge. Questions are also raised as to how the Divisional Secretaries of Wellawaya and Buttala had directed the surveying of a forest land belonging to the Department of Forest Conservation. During September-October months in 2010 Dole Lanka Company had obtained electricity to the Agri project with the blessings of the officials of the Department of Forest Conservation.
While these developments took place, Senior Deputy Conservator of Forests (Environmental Manager) Mahinda Senevirathne and the then Deputy Conservator of Forests of Uva Central Zones Wasantha Dissanayake had visited the lands acquired by Dole Lanka Company on 04/02/2013. Later by letter dated 28/02/2013 and under reference number P/M/8/02/14/25 the Senior Deputy Conservator of Forests (Environmental Manager) had given instructions further in this regard, and considering this acquisition as an offence in terms of letter dated 28/03/2013 ref. no 48/2013 and letter dated 03/04/2013 ref no 47/2013 and taken action to prepare ejectment notices to be signed on 13/04/2013 so as to take possession of these lands by the Department of Forest Conservation and forwarded these letters to the Department of Forest Conservation for further action. However even up to the year 2015 these ejectment notices had remained unsigned. It is time that President Maithripala Sirisena as the subject minister intervenes in this regard.



Ejection notices
Once again the ejectment notices were prepared on 08/07/2015 under the same charge sheet numbers, sent to the Director General of Forest Conservation had been signed and returned.
Accordingly steps were taken to hand over the notices on July 10 and 13 in 2015. As the company failed to vacate the said properties court action was instituted under ref no 92814 and 92815 to obtain ejectment orders. In response to a complaint made to the Prime Ministers office and International Trade Ministry with regard to obtaining ejectment orders against Dole Lanka Company from the courts, the Secretary to the Prime Minister E.M.S.B. Ekanayake and Minister Malik Samarawickrama had made inquiries from the Director General of Conservation of Forests. In reply to this query the Director General of Conservation of Forests by his letter dated 25/01/2016 ref no H/05/07/ m$40$2015 had stated that as the relevant companies are registered with the Board of Investments Sri Lanka and under the Forest Conservation Ordinance and also as discussed with the advisors to the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister, to arrive at a settlement on three conditions. They are:
01- Dole Lanka Company and Nelna company to accept in courts that the forest lands presently possessed by them belong to the Department of Forest Conservation and hand over the rightful ownership to the Department of Forest Conservation.
02- On handing over the ownership to the conservation, to make an assessment of the damage caused to the environment by the companies and to reimburse such amount to restore the forest coverage or for a suitable development programme in the abutting forest lands.
03- With the view to continue the project without any hindrance, and acting in accordance with the regulations of the Department of Forest Conservation and with the approval of the subject Minister submit a Cabinet Memorandum and under an annual licence for the Forest Conservation Department to be provided with facilities to issue a license to carry on the activities of the companies. Considering its location in a very sensitive environmental zone, environmental organisations are against the re-vesting of these lands with the same companies without carrying out an ejectment.
The Director of the Environmental Conservation Trust Environmentalist Sajeewa Chameekara opined that, The lands encroached upon by the said companies are located in close proximity to the Lunugamvehera and Yala National Parks and in a very sensitive zone teeming with wild Elephants. With the occupation of these lands the Human Elephant conflict aggravated. In order to sustain the large acreage of cultivation by the companies water had to be obtained from all available resources. With the tapping of water from Kuda Oya, Menik Ganga and Deep wells, the area is now under threat of a severe water shortage. The scarcity of water has also affected the wild animals in the area. These companies obtained these lands with the connivance of Ministers and MPs of the former Government in a very corrupt manner. This Yahapalana Government which came to power promising to do away with corruption, seems to be continuing with the same activities. We hope that the President as the subject Minister would draw his attention in this regard, if not the decision taken by the Department of Forest Conservation would set a bad precedence. Our attempts to contact Ms Vindya Weerasekera the Director of Dole Lanka Company proved futile.


Nelna responds
When we contacted the Managing Director of Nelna Company Gunapala Nanayakkara, he said, Ours is a company registered with the Sri Lanka Board of Investments. We obtained these lands through the Moneragala District Development Committee following a legal procedure. We have a file full of documents to prove the ownership of these lands. I have made a considerable investment in the 500 acres of land I have obtained. About 200 workers are employed. We are ready to face any eventualities when they surface. If these lands belong to the Department of Forest Conservation, we would abide by any decision they take. Some of the officers who gave these lands to us are not there even in Moneragala. I do not wish to speak further on this matter he said.

Army decided to recall Lt. Col. Kalana Amunupure  from Mali
	
Sri Lanka Army today said it has decided to recall Commander of its 200-strong contingent assigned to the UN peacekeeping force in Mali, Lieutenant Colonel Kalana Amunupura in response to the request made by the United Nations.
Earlier, the UN asked the Sri Lankan Government to repatriate Lieutenant Colonel Amunupura owing to alleged involvement in war crimes.
It is pertinent to place on record that appointment of Lt. Col. Amunupure was agreed by the UN itself after the Sri Lanka Army forwarded the names of four nominees in the year 2016 before the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (SLHRC) was entrusted the task of vetting service personnel, bound for UN assignments in December 2017 as advised by the UN, the Army said in a statement.
The Army said that at that stage the UN had cleared Lieutenant Colonel Amunupura for the appointment of the Commander of Combat Convoy Company in Mali (MINUSMA) dropping all three other nominees.
Meanwhile, the Army confirmed that there was no any involvement of Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (SLHRC) in recalling Lieutenant Colonel Kalana Amunupura in question.

Chefs preparing Lankan food injured in gas explosion in Canberra
	
Four young chefs were preparing Sri Lankan food for an upcoming event when a gas explosion scorched their pop-up kitchen on Wednesday night, leaving them with severe burns.
All four people were in a stable condition at Canberra Hospital on Thursday, after two were in serious condition after the explosion ripped through the re-purposed shipping container at Canberra City Farm about 11pm, the Brisbanee Times reported.
They suffered burns to up to 40 per cent of their bodies, including to their legs, torso and faces, according to paramedics.
ACT Work Safety Commissioner Greg Jones said preliminary investigations indicated the explosion occurred around the time the chefs were changing LPG gas bottles.
The blast gutted the shipping container, which commercial kitchen business Homegrown Me has hired out to users since April last year.
Homegrown Me founder Georgina Prasad said she was devastated and shocked after being informed of the explosion late on Wednesday.
Ms Prasad did not disclose the identity of the chefs, but said they had used the kitchen previously and were preparing food for an event when the explosion occurred.
"They are a young, emerging small business and they are very keen to share their [Sri Lankan] culture and their food," Ms Prasad said.
"They had only recently started up in the past few months, and this kitchen was an opportunity for them to try and establish themselves."
Ms Prasad said a range of groups and businesses used the kitchen, including not-for-profits, refugee groups and aspiring restaurateurs.
She said all users were required to undertake safety training before they were allowed to use the kitchen.
Mr Jones said the kitchen's safety procedures, as well as the equipment and appliances used on site would be scrutinised as part of the WorkSafe investigation.
ACT Policing are not investigating the incident.
Canberra City Farm president Keith Colls, whose organisation leases the space for the shipping container to Ms Prasad, said the explosion was devastating for the community.
Mr Colls said the farm used the Homegrown Me kitchen to make products, including jam.
"We are happy to support Georgina in getting the kitchen back up an running because it is a really useful asset to have," Mr Colls said.
"From the farm's point of view, it is really important as it value-adds for us - we don't need to go and hire a commercial kitchen to make our jams and chutneys.
"We would love to see it stay."

Court refuses to accept AGs secret document
	
The Colombo Fort Magistrate's Court today refused to accept a secret document to be filed by the Attorney General in the Central Bank bond scam case.
Magistrate Lanka Jayaratna said it should be filed in court as a public document.
At the outset of the inquiry President's Counsel Anil Silva appearing for Arjun Aloysius requested the court to grant bail to his client under special circumstances. He said his clients child was suffering from a rare blood disease found in one in a thousand patients.
The counsel said Mr. Aloysius is also suffering from severe depression and should be treated abroad.
He said the prosecution is deliberately stigmatizing his client so as to keep him in remand and pointed out that this too should be considered as a special circumstance to grant bail to his client.
Meanwhile Senior Counsel Jeewantha Jayasinghe appearing with Ralitha Amarasena said that he will not move for bail for the fourth suspect Kasun Palisena at this stage as his client had still not been able to obtain the necessary documents of the case to prepare the bail application.
The Magistrate reserved her order on the bail application and ordered the PTL not to tamper with the data and the server of the computers as they were case productions.
The two suspects were further remanded till November 8.
Haripriya Jayasundara with Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appeared with the CID for the prosecution.(T. Farook Thajudeen and Yoshitha Perera)

Eco Grip : Taking a serious grip on nature
     	 
  At the Daily Mirror, we believe that climate change is one of the greatest threats that we, as Sri Lankans, will face in the future.  Therefore, we intend to provide our readers with local and international content with the objective to educate and inspire. We would also like to learn from our valued readers about any ongoing initiatives in making Sri Lanka a more sustainable nation.   
 We aim to explore sustainable ways of living that have the most positive impact on not just our natural environment, but also for humans and animals.  
While topics such as global warming, pollution, and inequality are confronting, we believe it's time the media stopped shying away from these issues and became an active participant in finding solutions - and we hope you will join us. 
     
				 		 
	
	

Sri Lanka was ranked the best travel destination on Lonely Planet for 2019. Surely this wouldnt have been a reality if the country was a concrete jungle. Hence we need to preserve the greeneries around us and attempt to make zero impact on nature. As a result of the growing concerns on plastic pollution, deforestation and other careless habits of mankind, a few forward thinking individuals have begun to do things differently. Eco Grip is one of those unique initiatives that not only caters to the adventure lover in us but also gives us a chance to appreciate nature.
It was all an accident, said Sameera Liyanage, Course Director at Eco Grip. His urge to do a different challenge with high intensity during an outbound training programme prompted him to quit his job and initiate Eco Grip. As its name suggests, Eco Grip is all about taking a grip at nature while staying close to our ecosystems. We need to look around and observe the different ecosystems and explore the 103 rivers we are blessed with! After three years of kayaking and canoeing in various waters we discovered more destinations other than Kithulgala and Bentota. Apart from adventure we wanted people to appreciate nature.
Hence the team at Eco Grip has a vision to engage people in activities that will encourage them to preserve nature. After seven years, Eco Grip is the only company that provides kayaking and canoeing tours down South. But Eco Grip is not only about kayaking or canoeing. We get our participants to plant trees by the rivers as means of preventing soil erosion, Sameera further said.
Beach cleanups have become a popular activity but have you heard of river cleanups Well, thats another activity you get to engage in while kayaking or canoeing with Eco Grip. We are proud to say that we are the initiators of this unique river cleanup concept in Sri Lanka, Sameera proudly said. We put our kayaks and canoes to the water and collect plastics and other toxic materials from the waterways in Sri Lanka! On average we remove 40-60 kg of plastic within a day. Along with the cleanup, participants also get a chance to have a traditional meal prepared by fresh produce bought from the local community. Eco Grip also funds awareness programmes which are done for locals to educate them on the consequences of throwing thrash to the rivers. However, Sameera believes that it has been a tough task to promote the concept among people mainly because other adventure-based programmes havent made awareness on safety practices. This has led to over exposure and overcrowding of sensitive ecosystems damaging their future existence, Sameera added. We maintain zero plastic waste policy in our tours. We use reusable water containers instead of plastic bottles. Instead of garbage bags we use sacks. We need to have zero impact on nature even because we are utilizing the ecosystem to have some fun.

Eco Grip offers customized expeditions based on time and skill levels. According to Sameera expeditions are arranged from half a day to four days. The half a day flat water canoe trip is ideal for beginners or nature lovers where they can enjoy the waterways and bird watching. The one day rainforest kayak tour down a scenic river is for the adventurer who needs a little excitement. This could be coupled with a hike at a rainforest and a camping experience for two days. For the next level of adventure lovers we have the total rainforest and kayak challenge where you visit the remotest rainforest, take a hike to 5 waterfalls then camp by Sinharaja and kayak down the river.
The Mahaweli expedition is their masterpiece where participants can observe wildlife and stay close to nature for three days. We also provide mountain bike tours and off-road jeep tours to visit and explore Sri Lanka differently. Snorkeling and surfing is also on the list. In addition to that Eco Grip also includes outbound training activities which could be customized upon request. We are blessed with so many beautiful landscapes but unfortunately not many companies provide responsible tour operations to preserve nature and remove waste that have been deposited over the years. We have a social responsibility to help the local people to benefit from the tourism industry which is always overlooked. We need to raise awareness among locals and the future generation to appreciate a sustainable ecosystem, Sameera said in his concluding remarks.

## Title: Excise busts booze racket to English fans at Premadasa stadium

Excise busts booze racket to English fans at Premadasa stadium
	
A major racket of selling foreign liquor to the UK fans at the fifth One Day International (ODI) cricket encounter between Sri Lanka and England, despite strict laws at R. Premadasa Stadium, was busted by the Colombo Excise officials on Tuesday afternoon when the match was in progress.
A group of Colombo Excise Officers in plain clothes raided an air-conditioned private spectator box at the Grandstand Pavilion of the R. Premadasa Stadium in Keththarama, where 20 seats were accommodated only to the UK fans.
A ticket of this private spectator box had been sold at Rs.7, 500 by the Sri Lanka Cricket and the organizers of the racket had sold the tickets only to non-locals at Rs.20, 500 inclusive of a range of strong spirits, beer and wine with other refreshments.
A Senior officer at the Colombo Excise Station told the Daily Mirror the entire programme has been organized by a local tour agency based in Kollupitiya through a Facebook page called eTicketing.co, which only opens for bookings made from England.
The address of the FB page is at 54, Salisbury Road, Southall, UB2 5QJ, London, United Kingdom.
The site has advertised tickets as Corporate Hospitality Box Seating from 20, 500 LKR per person with the added benefits of the package as the Air-conditioned environment, beer cans, selection of drinks Black Label /Smirnoff Vodka /Wine, selection of juices  soft drinks  water with refreshments and dinner.
The Excise officials through a contact in London had booked four tickets at a cost of Rs.82, 000 saying for four English fans and had got it delivered through the office of the local tour agency in Kollupitiya.
When the officers arrived at the spectator box at the stadium around 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, when the match had just begun, there had been 16 spectators who were all from the UK.
The organizers had, however, showed themselves at 3.30 p.m. with the goods, when several annoyed foreign spectators, had started complaining what had happened to the liquor and other goods promised for their LKR 20, 500 tickets.
Then the organizers had asked them to wait some more time saying as the liquor was being delivered by their supplier.
The Excise Officers in civvies had witnessed a vehicle that had entered through the main entrance of the R. Premadasa Stadium was going back after the stock of liquor was unloaded downstairs near the elevator.
The stock of liquor, which was brought up to grandstand pavilion through the elevator had not been allowed to take out by the Excise Officers as it could rouse the nearing patience of the English fans.
Instead, they had taken the stock back to the ground floor and the two men of the organising committee who were present at the time were taken into custody along with the booze.
The seized stock contained six bottles of Johnnie Walker Black Label Whiskey, six bottles Smirnoff Vodka, a range of wine bottles and close to about 50 cans of beer, which were worth up to Rs.300, 000.
With the arrest of the organisers by the Excise the English fans had enraged for not serving them with refreshments and alcoholic beverages they have already paid in advance for the plush spectator box.
The Excise Officers had however taken down the registration details of the vehicle that delivered the liquor to the stadium and had ordered an investigation as to how such a racket was underway despite strict laws pertaining to bringing in outside liquor to cricket matches.
Although, Excise Licence had been granted to sell only beer at five points within the stadium premises to its thousands of spectators, liquor brought from outside is completely prohibited as per the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) regulations.
The Excise Department suspects that the organisers of the liquor racket had a highly placed backing from within the SLC, as such activity was impossible with the heavy levels of security placed at the R. Premadasa Stadium when an international match is in progress.
A special probe has been launched by the Anti-Corruption Unit of the SLC and they too were seemed to be baffled as to how such racket was operating under their nose.
Colombo Excise Station OIC Chief Inspector Chanaka Nanayakkara is conducting investigations with his team Excise Inspectors Chinthaka Udapamunuwa, V. P. Gamini, Sanjaya Nishantha and Excise Guards Sampath Liyanage, Ravindra Perera, Nilantha Rajapaksa and Hemantha Dissanayake on the instructions of Assistant Excise Commissioner B. A. Dayaratne (Western Province) and Excise Superintendent Vijitha Gamanayake (Colombo City).
The two arrested suspects, who were aged 26 and 24 years of age, will be produced before Colombo Chief Magistrates Courts today.
The Excise Officers conducted the raid with a Search Warrant obtained from Court. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

He was earlier interdicted by the National Police Commission (NPC) last week in this connection.
On Tuesday, the CID informed the Fort Chief Magistrate that from the 124 voice cuts sent to the Government Analyst he had identified 123 of them as those of Nalaka de Silva.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

France liberates young students from smartphone addiction while at school
	

These days its normal to see children and teenagers glued to the screens of their phones and many parents are familiar with the tantrums that ensue when screen time is stopped. What many parents probably dont know is that smartphone use releases dopamine into the brain (the feel-good chemical) in the same way that illegal drugs such as cocaine work a study by the University of Maryland has found. This is a disaster for the developing brains of our children and severely impairs a childs ability to concentrate on subject matter and retain information in school. While most schools already have a ban on using mobile phones in class, students are usually still allowed to use them during their break  with children now preferring to sit and stare at a screen rather than exercising or socializing with friends.
In light of this, France is now the first country to create what theyve called a detox law which bans the use of mobile phones throughout the entire school grounds. Currently the law is only to take affect for students in elementary, primary and middle school grades but France hopes a law such as this will help combat the growing addiction to technology facing their youth. Some schools were already ahead of the programme and had great success. One such school is rural Brittanys La Gautrais who banned mobile phones 4 years ago and the students couldnt be happier. One 14 year old girl said I do have a phone, but I leave it at home and dont really think about it much, I dont rush to check it after school. When I get home, first Ill have a snack, Ill chat to my mum, do some homework, then I might look at my phone. But only if Im waiting for an important message. What might seem strange to kids these days is that two of her friends dont even own mobile phones at all. We dont really need phones because were always chatting to each other in person, we chat the whole time  too much probably  and were really good friends, one said.
Freeing up children from mobile phones during breaktimes give them to chance to experience all the joy that children used to have in the playground  imaginary games, team sports or just quietly reading. If the ban proves to be successful hopefully other countries will follow suit in helping the youth of today to find a happy balance between technology and the real world.

Govt. to seek clarity from UNHRC: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is reported to have said the Government should get certain matters clarified with regard to the implementation of the provisions of the UNHRC Resolution 30/1 on Sri Lanka, it is learnt.
The Prime Minister had reportedly made these remarks during Tuesdays Cabinet meeting.
He said the Government delegation should initiate action in this direction during the next UNHRC Session scheduled for March, next year.
At the same meeting, the President expressed dismay that the International Community remained rigid in its stand on Sri Lanka though the Government had taken adequate measures to ensure the rights of minorities in keeping with the UNHRC Resolution.
He said this while expressing his concerns over the move to recall Commander of the Sri Lankan Military contingent in Mali, Lt Colonel Kalana Amunupura. (Kelum Bandara)

Grade-5 scholarship exam not compulsory anymore: Akila
	
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said yesterday he had instructed his Ministry Secretary to rescind the circular which made the Grade 5 scholarship examination compulsory for schoolchildren .
He said this at the prize-giving of Anula Vidyalaya in Nugegoda and pointed out that he took this
decision after consideration the recommendations of the Review Committee which looked into the restructuring of the scholarship exam.
The minister said the scholarship examination was introduced to ensure that the children of low-income families have access to popular schools.
Only 120 out of about 300,000 students who sit the exam get the opportunity to enter popular schools. This is a grave violation of their rights. The committee has pointed out that children are further depressed with having to attend tuition classes. This competitive examination has a negative mental impact on the children, he said.
Several important decisions on the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination will be taken in the future. They will be based on the recommendation of the panel, the minister said and added that in future it would be optional for students to sit the Grade-5 Scholarship examination.

Its time for some serious Scrabble this Sunday
	
The Parish Hall of St. Pauls Church, Milagiriya was transformed into a gaming centre. It wasnt the usual gaming as one may think, but a crowd of senior citizens were deeply engaged in scrabble, bridge, carrom and other word and board games. They were in fact getting ready to face the All Island Senior Citizens Scrabble Tournament. Senior citizens - once an active lot are now more or less confined to their own spaces. But do they deserve it Senior citizens, like everybody else should have the space to move around and engage in activities that will keep them occupied. Upon realizing the growing number of senior citizens and the need for them to interact with their friends, Sita Seneviratne, the then Chairperson of the Ceylon Social Service League initiated this Tournament. 
Hence the first Scrabble tournament was held in 1999 and the All Island Senior Citizens Association has organized it ever since. We learnt colonial English and we are very familiar with those words, said Indrani Athukorale, Co-chairperson of the Tournament. This tournament brought in a lot of enthusiasm and it brought in a lot of people who were not connected with our association before. We use the Collins Scrabble Dictionary and the Oxford Dictionary. The winner of the A division receives the Deshabandu Clara Motwani Challenge Cup while B division winner gets the Rajathi Kandasamy memorial cup. In addition to the tournament we also go on a picnic so that the members could relax and have fun. We also organize lunches every month. We also sell items done by our members from time to time and they will be available on the day of the tournament as well. Scrabble tournaments are held every year and throughout the year there are three or four tournaments held for senior citizens.
Senior citizens, like everybody else should have the space to move around and engage in activities
There are two categories and players can choose whether they want to play in Division A or B. The Division A uses the Collins Scrabble Dictionary while Division B uses the Oxford Dictionary. Players in Division B are given extra time and will only play five games while those in Division A will play six games. It is not only a day for scrabble but participants and members will also engage in fellowship after the tournament. 
We like to open more branches in several other areas because senior citizens need a chance to relax and engage at the same time, said Farida Akbarally, Co-chairperson of the Tournament. With activities such as scrabble it gets them to think and they dont feel time passing. Children should encourage their parents to engage in these activities. Sometimes they are not even aware that these events are being organized. Their parents are at an age where they need to be occupied rather than sitting in one place. In addition to scrabble we also have board games such as carom and card games such as Bridge and 304. Anybody interested can come along and they dont have to be a professional in these games to be a part of the association. The Tournament is open for all participants over 50 years of age.
The Tournament will be held on October 28 at the Hilton Colombo, Amethyst Room. Tickets are priced at Rs. 800 and could be obtained from Farida Akbarally at No. 28, Clifford Road, Bambalapitiya or Indrani Athukorale at No. 102/1, DharmapalaMawatha, Col. 7. (Telephone: 0112 696993)

In my first statement to the CID, I have revealed that Fonseka had close links with former DIG Nalaka de Silva. He (Fonseka) was not aware of the secret statement, which I gave to CID about him, he said.
Several times Sarath Fonseka spoke about me and threatened to expose me. I would say that Fonseka and several others are behind this case. I believe the President will pay attention in this regard, he said.

## Title: Notes for a Manifesto:  Health, the most precious gain
## Section: Opinion

Notes for a Manifesto:  Health, the most precious gain
	
One of the most quoted references of Gautama Buddhas teachings on well-being is the 204th verse of the Dhammapada, contained in the Sukhavagga or the Discourses on Happiness:
Aroga parama labha
san tutthi paramam dhanan
vis asa parama nathi
Nibbanan paramam sukhan
Acharya Buddharakkitha 
translates it as follows: Health is the most precious gain and contentment the greatest wealth; a trustworthy person is the best kinsman and Nibbana the highest bliss.
Health, contentment, kin and Nibbana can each be elaborated, but this is no thesis on Buddhism. What we need to draw is the importance of good health as being a condition that surpasses all else in terms of the tangibles one can obtain in life. A healthy nation can therefore be considered a kind of bedrock for all other improvements. Obtaining it is not easy. It is not that our leaders have been oblivious to the subject of health. For decades weve trotted out laudable numbers pertaining to importance indicators of good health, mostly flowing from an excellent public health system complemented by equally excellent awareness programs.
The question thats often being asked is whether it is sustainable. In other words, there are doubts that a country with an economy such as ours can afford to subsidize to the extent it does
The question thats often being asked is whether it is sustainable. In other words, there are doubts that a country with an economy such as ours can afford to subsidize to the extent it does. Perhaps it is not about blanket subsidies but intelligent support from the state. The discussion on the sector in recent times have been caricatured into a private vs public debate. Within it, theres mention of a national policy on drugs, price formulas for private hospitals and of course the controversy over private medical schools.
In all this, there has been a concerted effort to dub the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) as the villain of the piece. They, unlike other professionals, are not supposed to have grievances. They earn enough, we are told (as though only those who earn less than some magical figure have grievances and therefore have the privilege to protest). That vilification extends to the services provided. State hospitals are not plush entities like private hospitals, it is lamented. There is over-crowding and a general unkempt appearance (which does not mean its unhygienic, note).
In all this, theres a lot missing. Nothing about the fact that hospitals are understaffed in almost all categories, that those who have to work do the work of several (unlike in private hospitals), that even today the state hospitals provide the best services across the board (a hospital is not a resort hotel, note) and offer the kind of medical surveillance a private hospital just does not. It must be noted that there are excellently maintained state facilities in certain parts of the country, which clearly says that meagre though the resources may be, they can be intelligently used. And yet, any medical mishap in any state hospital is inflated in the media whereas negligence in private hospitals is swept under the carpet (if indeed it is even known!).
That said, the solution is not to have a policy of destroying one or the other, but to figure out a system where anyone has access to medical care that is affordable. Insurance has been offered as a solution, but the system introduced recently for school children essentially gets the tax-payer to fatten insurance companies and private hospitals.
As mentioned, it is not about the services but also about the drugs. Here too there is the public vs private matter being debated. Drug companies are villains, some say. The State Pharmaceuticals Corporation just cant deliver, others say. The default option so far has been to let multinational pharmaceutical companies to do as they please. There is very little talk about private-public partnerships or supporting the development of a local pharmaceutical industry.
Time was when regular work in the household and community provided all the exercise necessary. That community and that household has been all but destroyed. Now we have walkways, gymnasiums, spas and expensive hospitals. Somewhere, somehow, the basics seem to have been forgotten. For example, the General Practitioner is almost a dying breed. Patients have taken over that role. If one has seen a skin specialist, then one is qualified to recommend that specialist to someone suffering the same or similar ailment. Wheres the debate on nutrition Wheres the debate on preventive measures Wheres community medicine Wheres awareness creation Wheres the debate on enabling environments Why are these not part of the overall discourse on development
As mentioned, it is not about the services but also about the drugs. Here too there is the public vs private matter being debated. Drug companies are villains, some say
Development has destroyed a lot of things. When forests go, so do a vast treasury of genes that has the potential to cure. A culture of untrammelled consumption of which junk food and all kinds of unhealthy substances are touted as being essential parts of the good life have severely compromised the general health of the population. Remember that all this was attended by a deliberate and concerted vilification of all things indigenous  foods, medicine and medical practices included. Indigenous medical practitioners and practices are vilified as indulgence in mumbo-jumbo, but faith-healers protected in the name of religious freedom.
Lets leave Nibbana aside. Contentment has been codified in terms of material things. There are no kin; there are only partners in all kinds of profit-making operations. Can we truly say that health in Sri Lanka is thought of as the most precious gain If not, why not
Over to you, M/s Nagananda Kodituwakku, Rohan Pallewatte, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Maithripala Sirisena and any other individual entertaining hopes of becoming the next President of Sri Lanka.

One Touch launches in Sri Lanka, aims to revolutionize the Sri Lankan TukTuk and Taxi industry
	
1 Touch Lanka (PVT) Ltd is proud to announce the launch of a revolutionary Taxi and TukTuk application in Sri Lanka. The One Touch app aims to provide its drivers a highly beneficial partnership that is unparallel to any other Taxi and TukTuk service existing in the country while also delivering an experience that is both smooth and fair to passengers.
Im delighted to be bringing our brand to Sri Lanka, and to be able to offer something considerably different to current offerings. - Group Chairman Allan Sharp said:
We are a socially responsible company, and believe all who work with us, or whom use services we provide are stakeholders. We have a responsibility to be fair, and to give something back to all involved. We, wherever possible, work with suppliers who understand this ethos and understand the benefits of this way of thinking. I look forward to our company making a positive contribution to Sri Lankan life 1 Touch Lanka plans to work closely with a respected Union to provide TukTuk drivers with benefits such as Life and Accident Insurance and will contribute a portion of their profits to a benevolent fund, which drivers can call on in times of need. In addition, this fund will be used to provide training opportunities, enabling self- improvement for drivers.
Taxi Drivers will be offered improved allocations, and more opportunities for occupied return journeys from the Airport and cities other than Colombo.
As a native of Colombo, Im proud to be bringing a product to the market that I genuinely believe will improve the lives of Sri Lankans. - Country Head and CEO Thilan Kannangara stated.
For too long drivers have had to put up with downward pressures on their income, and as a result, customer service suffers, as drivers justifiably dont want to collect passengers for short journeys. This is compounded by commissions and conditions that lead to a large proportion of driver wages being lost. In turn this means passengers suffer long waits, and deal with a fare structure that can result in the fare for the same journey at the same time varying by over 200%.
By offering commission free services to drivers and offering passengers a stable fare structure, 1 Touch Sri Lanka aims to provide both parties with solutions that are equal to and at times surpassing what is already in place, while honouring their social responsibility commitments. This in turn will result in passengers preferring the One Touch app as their preferred method of transport.

Prez furthers patriotic agenda as rift with UNP widens
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has said that the Government has done enough in implementing the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka
The gulf between President Maithripala Sirisena and the United National Party (UNP) is widening by the day. Alongside, President Sirisena is increasingly toeing the patriotic agenda. The national minded approach of the President came to the fore once again at Tuesdays Cabinet meeting as he expressed dismay over the move to recall Lieutenant Colonel Kalana Amunupura who served as the commander of the Sri Lankan Army contingent deployed for UN peace keeping in the West African nation of Mali.
Lieutenant Colonel Amunupura is serving in Mali with a contingent of 199 personnel under his command. The deployment of this contingent for peace keeping duties in Mali was done after a vetting process in keeping with UN requirements.
Sri Lanka is now likely to make fresh diplopic efforts to renege from its binding to the UNHRC process.
	Sujeewa pinpointed UNP Chairman Highways Minister Kabir Hashim for not gearing up the party machinery
What apparently bewildered the President is the recall of Lt Colonel Amunupura merely on allegations purported to have been made by Yasmin Sooka, a Human
Rights lawyer who served in the Darusman Committee or the committee appointed by the UN Secretary-General after the war concluded in Sri Lanka to probe allegations of rights violations. Sookas role has been disputed by many in political circles here.
The President reportedly asked as to how Lieutenant Colonel Amunupura could be recalled sans an inquiry. He is now serving in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). His term of assignment will, however, end in December, this year.
Then, it transpired at the Cabinet meeting that the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka was involved in vetting troops bound for peacekeeping duties under the UN.
In all indications, there is a wide chasm now developed between the President and the UNP. It became even more obvious when he said that the UNP of D.S. Senanayake (the first Prime Minister of Sri Lanka) was no more
It led to the President having misgivings about the Human Rights Commission here. Often heard is the rhetoric that the current Government won over the entire world, and saved soldiers from being haulled up before any war crime tribunal.
The President himself made pronouncements to this effect on and off. Against such a backdrop, the President said the Government had done enough in implementing the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka and ensuring minority rights, but the international community did not reciprocate it with any leniency.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stressed the point that the Sri Lankan delegation should seek clarity further on the implementation of the UNHRC resolution in March, next year under these circumstances.
Champika exposes UK duplicity
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka took a line similar to that of the President at this instance. He said the United Kingdom, a leading country of the core group that worked on the resolution on Sri Lanka, was dealing with LTTE activists in that country with velvet gloves, but with tough hands against activists of other terrorists outfits such as the ISIS.
In this instance, he referred to how the LTTE activists arrested in connection with the protest during Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes address to the Oxford Union, were dealt with in a soft-hearted manner and set free within a few hours.
According to the Minister, it has happened because of the current policy of the Government in regards to the UN process. He asked the Government to initiate action to withdraw from the co-sponsorship of the UNHRC resolution 30/1 adopted on October 1, 2015.
The Government is riddled with differences on many a front. Difference of opinion in regards to the UNHRC process in Geneva is much more pronounced as evident at the Cabinet meeting.
It was reported that the President was in the dark regarding the decision to co-sponsor the resolution at that time. Sri Lanka is now likely to make fresh diplopic efforts to renege from its binding to the UNHRC process.
UNP tries to get act together 
The UNP is poised to prompt to replenish its vote base ahead of the future elections due next year. The party faced a debacle at the Local Government Polls on February 10.
The partys parliamentary group had a confab with Leader Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Monday. According to sources, the UNP discussed the need to address the unemployment issue by giving more appointments to graduates.
Besides, Deputy Minister of Power and Energy Ajith P. Perera stressed the point that the Government should constitute the next Trial-at-Bar at High Court to accelerate litigation against corruption and frauds during the former rule.
Afterwards, State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe, now facing corruption charges, bemoaned that the party was not extending its cooperation to him to present his case and absolve himself of any wrongdoing. He pinpointed UNP Chairman Highways Minister Kabir Hashim for not gearing up the party machinery to counter allegations against him. 
He is accused of seeking commissions to clear hurdles for investment in an electric rail project in Sri Lanka. The company, formed by some expatriate Sri Lankans, has made open allegations against Senansinghe.
I am the one who voiced against corruption during the Rajapaksa era fearlessly for five years. Today, there are calculated and concerted efforts by some with vested interests to bring false and unfounded accusations against me. Mr.Kabir Hashim, as the party Chairman, maintains stoic silence in the face of these allegations. This is an affront to the party. It is not a mere attack on me alone, he said.
Also, he expressed his gratitude to Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara Jayamaha and Minister Harin Fernando for standing by him in countering these allegations.
Afterwards, Galle District MP Bandulalal Bandarigoda, Kegalle District MP Sandeeth Samarasinghe and Polonnaruwa District MP Nalaka Kolonne pledged to throw their weight behind Senansinghe in defending his case.
So far, only Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara has directed an impartial investigation based on my complaint, the State Minister said.
He was also critical of the mainstream media highlighting some of the allegations against him without ascertaining their veracity.
State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne underpinned the need to use available media regulations to prevail upon journalists to report the verifiable truth.
Presidents RAW claim put to rest
In addition, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake inquired about the Presidents claim that Indias Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) had a hand in the alleged plot to assassinate him. Consequent to the allegation by the President at last weeks Cabinet meeting, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, a close confidant of the President, four Cabinet Ministers were having links with RAW, and they would be exposed soon.
Ramanayake inquired about all these from the Prime Minister at the group meeting. The Prime Minister, however, said the President had denied it, and therefore the matter had been put to rest.There is nothing more to it, he said.
Kiriella the emerging Buddhist leader for UNP
For the first time after 15 years, Asgiriya Chapter conferred the highest accolade of Sasanamamaka Janaprasadana to Public Enterprise Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella. Last time, it was offered to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Speculation is now rife that Kiriella will cash in on this conferment to project his image as the emerging Buddhist leader of the UNP. The lack of appeal among the Sinhala Buddhists is a concern for the UNP. May be, the new accolade from the Buddhist chapter will ensure political benefits for Kiriella to fill this void.
In all indications, there is a wide chasm now developed between the President and the UNP. It became even more obvious when he said that the UNP of D.S. Senanayake (the first Prime Minister of Sri Lanka) was no more. With this development, the UNP is trying hard to get its act together before the next elections.
PM briefs President on his Indian visit
Soon after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe returned from India, he called on President Maithripala Sirisena and briefed him about the outcome of his interactions with the Indian leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 
Besides, he notified the Cabinet that Indian High Commissioner Taranjith Singh Sandhu would get back to the government with his New Delhis response to the proposed Indian investments in Sri Lanka.

Rotarys thirty year fight against Polio
	
Marking World Polio Awareness Day on October 24, Rotary International has worked tirelessly for a time period spanning over three decades to eradicate Polio from the world.Polio is a virus that affects the nervous system of the body and extreme cases may lead to paralysis. It also mainly affects children below the age of 5 years. The fastest and easiest solution to be immune to the disease is a simple vaccination. However, due to the lack of proper health care and poor access to clean water, the disease still survives in some countries and Rotary, along with other established organisations, work towards making the world Polio-free.
This has been the longest standing and most significant effort taken by Rotary. The brainchild project for this issue began in 1985 when PolioPlus was launched by Rotary International. Mass vaccination took place under this program in 122 countries to 2.5 billion children. Further progress was made with Rotary working closely with the World Health Organisation. The Polio Eradication Fundraising Campaign also took place in the beginning of the 21st century. The most notable milestone was made as Rotary joined hands with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Throughout the years, the Foundation has been the main source of funding to the Rotary projects against Polio. 
Currently Polio is prevalent in three countries, namely Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan. Until it is eradicated, the rest of the world still remains at risk. More than a million Rotary members have spent their time and resources in trying to help eradicate Polio. However, due to the lack of resources, poverty, health facilities etc. this has been a tedious task. Less and less cases of Polio are reported annually and this is seen as a positive outcome of the steps taken by Rotary. Collaborating with global ambassadors, including many high-ranking individuals as well as celebrities, the This Close campaign works towards making communities aware of the effects of Polio and help in empowering those affected by it.
For all these amazing initiatives being implemented, large amounts of funds are required. This year Rotary aims to raise $3.4 million to serve this purpose. In addition to this, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will double the amount for every donation given. You can help us too. Simply make a donation on the official End Polio website handled by Rotary. Remember that each dollar helps bring a vaccine closer to one small child. Standing together, you too can assist in changing history and making the world Polio-free.

Salt water rice experiment in desert proves successful
	

Chinese scientists may have solved the mystery on being able to grow food in the desert. Trials in Dubai recently proved to be successful with a strain of rice that is able to grow in saltwater with the added bonus that it can also provide higher crop yields. While the jury is still out on genetically modified food, due to lack of freshwater on the planet it becoming increasingly hard to grow enough rice to feed the demand.
The next step for the researchers at Qingdao Saltwater Rice Research and Development Center is launching an experimental 100-hectare saltwater rice farm in 2019 that will evaluate the costs of production and different farming techniques  their long-term goal is to cover 10% on the United Arab Emirates with saltwater rice paddies, essentially being able to feed the entire Arab world.

15 SE Uni. students arrested for Contempt of Court
	
Fifteen students of the South Eastern University had been arrested this morning for laying siege on the administrative building disobeying the court order, the Akkaraipattu Police said today.
They said the students stayed inside the administrative building and locked out the staff of the University Administration.
The students will be produced in the Akkaraipattu Magistrate Court today, police said
Yesterday, the University administration announced that it had decided to close all faculties indefinitely due to the protest at the administrative building since October 12.
Meanwhile, University Registrar H. Abdul Saththar said a group of Technology Faculty students laid siege in the administrative building.
The students were demanding the authorities to reinstate four students, who were dismissed over ragging, he said.
A group of students was subjected to the disciplinary inquiry over ragging several students in the University.
After the inquiry, the University Grants Commission (UGC) decided to dismiss the studentship of four students in the Technology Faculty.
A court order was issued on October 15 by the Akkaraipattu Magistrates Court ordering the students to disperse from the administrative building.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror a member of the Students Union of the Faculty of Technology said after suspending their studentships their parents had come to the faculty to meet the administration.
The administration did not meet the parents and they had locked our parents in the administration room for one and half days. Finally, the students broke into the administration room released their parents. In the meantime, the administrative department had made a police complaint. After the police arrived they got understood the situation and told to arrange a discussion with the Vice Chancellor., he said.
We were the first technology students batch in the South Eastern University which is in Oluvil where most of them are Muslim nationals. We do not have enough facilities to continue our studies. We made many requests to the university administration, but still, we did not get any.
Even the university hostels were not safe for female students to live, he said.(Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Sirisenas assassination saga The plot is now interesting
	
President Maithripala Sirisena who was moving freely with the citizenry would see his movements being curtailed following the much talked about threat to his life
All of us, unless enlightened or spiritually inclined, fear death. Spiritual guru the late Bhagavan Shree Rajneesh (Osho) once said that death is blissful for those who have lived life to the fullest. But death in the political scene is something quite different to how life ends in the spiritual realms of human life.
When life is snuffed out in the political scene through killings or untimely deaths, we are aghast. Right now there is talk about there being assassination plots to kill the president and the former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The story about the assassination plot gathered momentum as the days rolled by and drew the attention of Indian Premier Narendra Modi because claims had been allegedly made by President Sirisena that Indias Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) may be involved in it.
All this begs the question why the Government doesnt clear the air about the assassination plot
	He has also said that there are Cabinet secrets that should not be disclosed to the public
	Sirisena is wise enough to know that this country has had a history of heads of state being assassinated
From what we have read in the newspapers we fathom that Sirisena is concerned about the threat to his life. That is natural because there is much for him to achieve as the head of the Yahapalana regime. He is not yet ready to go because so little has been done during the tenure of this utility Government. This is largely because of the tug-of-war between the president and the premier; whose henchmen form the majority of the government.
Sirisena is a Buddhist who has lived an exemplarily life as a citizen of this country. But the luxury life that politics offers and the power vested upon him as president probably make him view death as something that should be postponed. We all must go when the time comes to bid adieu to planet earth. But a politician may think differently.
ultimatum
If there is anyone who put the subject of death so early into the mind of President Sirisena its whistle blower Namal Kumara. The revelation of an assassination plot not only makes Sirisena intricately plan his future moves, but also highlights that wonderful lesson of Gautama Buddha that all good products come with a shelf life. Sirisena, a product of Pollonaruwa, rose to stardom in 2015 when the UNP and key members of the opposition united to field him as the presidential candidate under the guidance of the late Ven. Sobitha Thera.
This assassination talk also serves Sirisena an ultimatum that its now or never for him. Getting bumped off or being unseated as President right now might have similar effects on Sirisenas career. Sirisena must find the strength to wade through the glue he is stuck in. On one side there is an economy thats crashing and on the other there is a support base (As in the vote base) for him which is fast diminishing. Right now the assassination talk has cost him dearly because India, the accused, is badly hurt. According to media reports a scheduled press conference which was supposed to brief the fourth estate about the Governments response to the assassination story had been canceled at the eleventh hour.
A prominent Government minister had said that the news that the Indian journalist was fed with, regarding the presidents alleged statement about the plot to kill him, was false. All this begs the question why the Government doesnt clear the air about the assassination plot by having a press conference, releasing an official statement or by the President himself using the Government media arm and addressing the nation. We have read so much about Government officials working overtime to communicate with New Delhi in its attempts to do damage control now. Should the Sri Lankan citizens be left in the dark during a time of great concern like this
Gotabaya putting a police entry with regard to the plot to assassinate him is a good enough happening to make Sri Lankan citizens demand to know the truths about this whole episode!
Sirisena sees the bits of information leaked to the press from what transpired at a Cabinet meeting as an attempt to tarnish his image and portray him as an enemy of India. Its now known that president Sirisena was not in favour of the East Container Terminal of the Colombo Port to be developed with Indias help. The Indian premier had meanwhile conveyed his displeasure over some of the Indian funded projects in Sri Lanka facing a delay in completion. Uninformed citizens of this country are forced to guess or listen to the speculative stories that are doing the rounds that Modi and Sirisena are drifting apart in their relationship. But the positive news from Colombo is that Sirisena has taken the initiative to strengthen ties with India and Modi.
Uninformed citizens
Minister Amaraweera has said that he would take to task the four ministers who conveyed vital information about the Cabinet meeting to an Indian journalist, who works for The Hindu newspaper. He has also said that there are Cabinet secrets that should not be disclosed to the public. Isnt the news about the plot to assassinate the president important enough for the people to know Gotabaya putting a police entry with regard to the plot to assassinate him is a good enough happening to make Sri Lankan citizens demand to know the truths about this whole episode!
Sirisena is wise enough to know that this country has had a history of heads of state being assassinated or there being attempts at taking their lives. The killing of President Ranasinghe Premadasa was master-minded by the LTTE and we all know that a good number of the tiger rebels were trained in India. We also know that over the years the Tamil Nadu Government had a soft corner for the tiger rebels. At one time during the civil war in the north it is said that LTTE Leader Velupillai Prabakaran went into hiding in India. (This is stated in the book Thiyuna Asipathaka Sevana Yata penned by Swaminathan Wimal). Indias interests in creating trouble for Sri Lanka dates back to the time of the islands kings. Hence the talk about the Indian national named M.Thomas claiming that he knew of the plot to assassinate the president leaves us wondering whether the adversities that the president faces gathered momentum with the aid of political winds that are blowing from India.
President Sirisenas Government has to do much investigation to get to the bottom of all this. Its reported in newspapers that Sirisena believes that Modi might not be aware of the alleged assassination plot. He believes that the Indian national could be a RAW agent. But above all the man who walked freely among crowds with the least security during the past two and a half years has now invited the thought of death to his mind.
Independent observers believe that these developments will hamper Sirisenas election plans for 2020. Even if the story about the assassination plot will take time to be proved, one thing is clear; those opposing the president have begun playing a psychological game to unnerve him. President Sirisena must revise the clock to 2010 and observe how Mahinda Rajapaksa held his nerve till the last minute to defeat Sarath Fonseka at the Presidential Elections.
In that election the person who could handle pressure better won in the end. Even if Sirisena survives the assassins bullet he has to negotiate the challenges that are thrown at him by his ownmen in the Yahapalana Government. The latter seems a tougher task than the first for Sirisena!

So Sri Lanka to become newest tourism tagline
	
So Sri Lanka will become Sri Lankas new tourism tagline from November 5, replacing Wonder of Asia, Mirror Business reliably learns.
Sources close to developing the tagline said the out-of-the-box and simple tagline aims to bring out the authenticity of Sri Lankas tourism product with greater engagement with travellers and locals.
Speaking to Mirror Business, Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB) Chairman Dehan Seneviratne, who was not in a position to reveal the new tagline officially, however noted that the new tagline would be officially launched at WTM in London, on November 5.
Neither confirming nor denying the So Sri Lanka as the new tagline, Seneviratne said the new tagline will be very natural, simple and highly adaptable.
Some may wonder why it is so simple. But why will be answered when you see the roll out of the tagline and the new brand identity, he said.
The new tagline was coined by the advertising agency J. Walter Thompson (JWT), which secured a US $ 2 million bid to develop a new brand identity and tagline for Sri Lanka tourism.
Seneviratne noted that the new tourism tagline has received the concurrences of the president and prime minister, while the SLTPB director board and industry stakeholders have also endorsed it.
Destinations such as Slovakia, Belize, Kiribati and Ukraine also launched similar out-of-the-box tourism slogans, recently.
Commenting on the new brand logo, Seneviratne said, Its different to what we have now. It has freshness and absolute simplicity. Therefore, it can be easily adaptable to engage people.
The success of the new brand identity will however largely depend on the execution of plans, according to marketing experts.
Seneviratne stressed that launching the new brand identity of Sri Lanka at WTM 2018 in London will enable the new brand to receive the required exposure.
WTM 2017 said to have attracted around 50,000 senior travel industry professionals, tourism ministers and international media.
Seneviratne noted that a special advertising campaign will be launched from November 5 to February, next year, to promote Sri Lanka tourism under the new logo and theme.
Subsequently, the SLTPB plans to launch the much-awaited global promotion campaign next March, at ITB Berlin, the worlds largest travel trade fair.
The comprehensive, three-year campaign will focus on five major source markets of Sri Lanka India, China, Germany, the United Kingdom and France as well as five other emerging markets and high-yielding markets such as Japan and the Middle East, according to the SLTPB officials.
Seneviratne emphasised that the promotion campaigns and new brand identity would appeal to all types of potential tourists as each tourist brings a unique value proposition.
Its not only about high-yielding tourists; we need the critical mass to come into the country as well. Some tourists come to the country as middle or low-income tourists. However, they spend quite a lot of money and are helpful in promoting Sri Lanka Tourism, though they might not necessarily stay at five-star hotels.
They keep on travelling around the country while sharing their experiences on social media, which is very helpful for promoting Sri Lanka Tourism, he pointed out.
Seneviratne noted that the global promotion campaign would have a lot of emphasis on social media and digital channels on the line of changing dynamics of media. (Nishel Fernando)

The disappeared documented in case collection
	
The mother of a boy who disappeared when he was then 20 year old says, Without my husband and son, I am sick and frustrated,. Kandhasami Mariyayi, another mother whose son disappeared at 21 says, I hope to see my children before my death. I made a complaint with the police and before the presidential commission regarding my children. So far there has been no finding.
This is how our life goes, says another disheartened mother of a 17-year-old.
These mothers testimonies and despair of not knowing the fate of their children are a few of 414 stories documented in Recordings of Hidden People - Part II, which was launched recently at the auditorium of the International Centre for Ethnic Studies (ICES). 
Silence in the public sphere on the issue of disappearance can cause collective amnesia which can have dangerous consequences and entrench a culture of impunity
Aritharan Sivanesamalars husband did not return home as usual after completing his work for the day at the paddy field. She has been toiling hard to bring up her son who was eventually arrested by the Sri Lankan forces in 2008 and released after four years. The mother of two children, Lingam Mankayarkarasis husband went to buy vadei and string hoppers when he disappeared. Soon afterwards she lost her job too and maintaining her family was a nightmare. I am living with so much distress, she says. 
Similar stories of untold sorrow envelope the pages of the case collection which is aimed at being a source of information to the Office on Missing Persons, The Human Rights Commission and the Right to Information Commission. 
The recent edition of the book documents the stories of persons from Vavuniya. The previous edition published last year documented the stories of enforced disappearances from the Mannar district. The book notes that the actual number of disappearances within the Vavuniya district exceeds 414 to about 550. Of the 414 stories documented, 364 are men and 51 are women. Hundred and eight are children below 18 years of age. Speaking at the launch Ambika Satkunanthan, a Commissioner at the Human Rights Commission said that the data presented was disturbing, but not surprising. Enforced disappearance was a tool that was used to crush dissent and to stifle opposition, she said. 
Pointing out the importance of documenting the stories she said that the sense of horror associated with a disappearance was no longer present. We need to document human rights violations, stories of not only victims but also their families and communities because the impact of a violation is not only on the victim but also on the broader community, she said. She added that such stories should be used to create awareness about the history of the country especially among the youth. 
Only five people among those who have shared their stories in the collection, have filed Habeas Corpus cases. According to the testimonies, 188 persons have allegedly been abducted by State military, 208 by unknown persons and 18 by Tamil militant groups. 
Because of the nature of the methods used in carrying out disappearances it is often difficult to piece together what happened to a person to enable an investigation to take place. Hence narratives of people are the key in the search for the truth, said Satkunanathan. 

Silence in the public sphere on the issue of disappearance can cause collective amnesia which can have dangerous consequences and entrench a culture of impunity. A culture of impunity and lack of accountability is something weve encountered in Sri Lanka during successive regimes in the past 30 years, she added. 
She also highlighted that in the case of ethnic violence, perpetrators often believed that they were fighting for a just cause and not that they have perpetrated a human rights violation. This means that perpetrators will also have overwhelming public support which in turn will prevent the government from prosecuting those responsible for these violations, she said. 
Because of the nature of the methods used in carrying out disappearances it is often difficult to piece together what happened to a person to enable an investigation to take place.
Meanwhile, Attorney-at-Law, Subajini Kisho Anton who is the Director of Law and Human Rights Centre, Jaffna pointed out how the mothers of the disappeared have been protesting on the roadside for more than 600 days in the North and how there has been no response. She stressed that both Tamils and the Sinhalese have been affected by enforced disappearances. 
Have the white vans gone away she quizzed. They wont go away unless the government is willing to counter impunity, she stressed. 
In an environment where accountability is not possible, we must try to treasure the evidence. We must document (these stories) with the hope justice will be delivered someday, she said speaking about the case collection that was launched. 
What is enforced disappearance
Article 2 of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance states, 
Enforced disappearance is considered to be the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which place such a person outside the protection of the law.

This is the starting point-PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who made a special statement on the naming of Sri Lanka as the top destination to visit in 2019 said this achievement should be a starting point to go to a higher level in tourism.
Let us make this award, for us, a starting point to go to a higher level of tourism, he said.
We are restructuring ourselves to be an export economy, and in the export economy, the tourism has received a principal place since it can be one of the fastest foreign exchange earners. Let us make it the starting point to double the revenue that we have from tourism, the Prime Minister said.
Following is the full text of his statement.
The Lonely Planet has named Sri Lanka as the Top Destination for 2019. I must first and foremost express our satisfaction and our delight in being so-named. This is a result of a policy we have followed from 2015, of giving prominence to tourism, of developing tourism - that today we have come into this category of being the top tourist destination. We have to maintain this, we cannot be satisfied with one destination award; it is only a start.
We have to look at the shortcomings in our tourist system (there are many), and we have to overcome them. We have to ensure that we plan for the future; that we cater for backpackers as well as high spending tourists. What matters to us first and foremost is a high income from tourists, not merely the numbers. Today we are a destination for people from Japan, China, India, and into Europe. We have to increase the numbers coming into the country. We have to safeguard our historical monuments, we must safeguard our natural wildlife, and we have to add more attractions.
Tourism today concerns a large number of people, not merely large hoteliers but all those who have homestay accommodations, small shops, and small restaurants. We should widen and increase the numbers participating and benefitting in tourism. At this moment I would like, first and foremost, to thank all those who are responsible for us being named a top destination. The Minister, Minister John Amaratunga and his staff, the Tourist Development Authority, members of the Tourism Task Force, and Advisory the Committee, who gave us their valuable service; all the people who are connected to and involved in the hospitality and tourism industry; and finally, I must also thank the people of Sri Lanka, for the friendly demeanor they have shown to all tourists. That's a part of our nature, and part of our heritage.
Let us make this award, for us, a starting point to go to a higher level of tourism. We are restructuring ourselves to be an export economy, and in the export economy, tourism has received a principle place since it can be one of the fastest foreign exchange earners. Let us make it the starting point to double the revenue that we have from tourism.

UK court opens inquest into two ruggerites deaths in SL
	
The Durham Coroner's Court in England has opened an inquest into the deaths of two British rugby players who died while on tour in Sri Lanka, the Northern Echo News reported on Thursday.
Thomas Andrew Howard and Thomas Reed Baty, both from Durham, died in Colombo while on tour with Clems Pirates, part of Durham City Rugby Club.
Coroner's Court heard that an investigation by Sri Lankan authorities found that both men had died as a result of the use of opiates.
They were discovered in their hotel room on the morning of Sunday, May 13, suffering from serious respiratory failure.
Durham police officer DC McElhone told the court that Mr Howard died that morning whilst en-route to the hospital while Mr Baty died on Tuesday 15th May in the hospital intensive care unit.
The pair had travelled to Sri Lanka on May 9 as part of a 25-strong team, which was in the country to play some rugby matches and do charity work.
The court heard that they had played a match with the Sri Lankan rugby team on Saturday, May 12, before having food and drink with the team.
They returned to the Kingsbury Hotel, at about 11pm before going to a local nightclub, where the team stayed until sometime between 2 to 3am.
It is understood that Mr Baty and Mr Howard left the club together and took a three-wheeler together. They were found in their room the next morning.
The Sri Lankan investigation concluded that Mr Howard's cause of death was by intoxication of heroin and Mr Baty's cause of death was an overdose of opiates, the court heard.
DC McElhone told the court that police were aware of and had requested further evidence from the authorities in Sri Lanka including witness statements, CCTV, photographs and transcripts of interviews.
He said it was uncertain when evidence would be finalised.

Where have all the tourists gone Or rather stayed
	
Even during the height of the war, they brought in tourists to the country and pumped in the much-needed foreign exchange to the reeling economy. When Tsunami wrecked havoc in southern and eastern coasts of Sri Lanka, they were able to rise from wreckage within a very short time, showing their resilience. Yes, we are talking about Sri Lankas hospitality industry, which is the third largest foreign exchange earner for the country that accounts for about 11 percent of the gross domestic product.
From the passionate speech made by The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) President Sanath Ukwatte at the associations 53rd Annual General Meeting a week ago, where Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was the chief guest, we understand that all at the hospitality trade isnt hunky-dory. Despite the record tourist arrivals, the publicly quoted hotel companies have been making losses. Although the financial accounts of the privately owned hotels are not in the public domain, they couldnt be doing any better than their listed peers. So, where do all these tourists who visit Sri Lanka stay The answer is Sri Lankas thriving informal accommodation sector.
Although exact data on the informal sector is scarce, several independent studies suggest that over 50% of tourists visiting Sri Lanka opt for accommodation in supplementary establishments i.e. guesthouses, hostels, rented apartments etc. Since the end of the war in 2009, a visible rise in the informal sector can be seen amid growing arrival numbers as a result of the lack of capacity in the formal sector due to the lack of investments during the conflict period. The growth in the phenomena of the independent traveller has also contributed to the rise of a booming informal sector in many a country. 
So, in this context, a vibrant informal sector may be vital, but letting that to overshadow the tax paying, regulated formal industry could be imprudent. The profits of the registered establishments in the formal accommodation sector are heavily taxed -- 15% VAT, 2% NBT, 10% service charge and 1% Tourism Development Levy. However, the informal sector accommodation providers pay no such taxes, creating an unequal playing field.
Apart from losing out the tax income, the other negative implication stemming from this development to the wider economy is the lack of big investments going into the hospitality sector. It has been no secret that during the last three or four years, investments into the hotel sector have dried out significantly and some investors who have already made investments have scaled down. Obviously this is not a good development for a country, which aspires to make tourism the number one foreign exchange earner.
If the authorities feel that getting the informal sector under the tax net -- especially given their low-cost operating model -- is difficult, it is reasonable they should look into giving some concessions to those in the formal sector who pay taxes, generate direct and indirect employment for over 350,000 people and continue to make sizeable investments into the growth of the hospitality industry.
Ukwatte in his speech made several important points, the authorities should take serious stock of. One such was the call to recognize tourism as an export industry. The government should seriously look at including tourism into its export strategy and provide the necessary concession similar to other export industries. Ukwattes suggestion to establish tourism trade zones, similar to export processing zones, could also be a very innovative approach to develop some of the under-developed tourism hot spots in the eastern and the northern parts of the island. Also, the authorities should look at eliminating some of the discriminatory taxes on the hotels, such as NBT, which is not applied to most of the other stake holders in the travel sector.
Further they should take cues from how other governments in the world are dealing with informal sectors, evidently much bigger than in in Sri Lanka, and try to bring them under some sort of regulatory control, making sure that those businesses pay their due taxes.
A strong formal sector, which makes continuous investments into the industry, is a must for the type of tourists the government wants to attract. Given Sri Lankas limited capacity, what really matters is the quality of the tourists and not the quantity. It is essential that Sri Lanka itself is a fine balance between high spending tourists and backpacker and all the country promotion and marketing campaigns should revolve around this notion. We all should always remind ourselves that having such potential in tourism -- the culture, heritage, beaches, wildlife, top class hotels, hospitable people -- worker remittances still remain the highest foreign exchange earner for the country, which is nothing less than a national embarrassment.
