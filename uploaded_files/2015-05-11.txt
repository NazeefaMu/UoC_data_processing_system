<U+200B>FCID not under Cabinet Sub-Committee: PMO
	
	?
The Prime Minister?s Office (PMO) said today the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) of the Police Department or the Anti-Corruption Committee Secretariat is in no way controlled by the Cabinet Sub-committee on Anti-Corruption.
The Office however said the progress of the investigations carried out by the FCID and other law enforcement agencies is reviewed once a week to ensure effective law enforcement.?
The Prime Minister?s office in a statement further said:
??Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) is only a functional division of the Police Department, which was established in response to the emerging trend of serious financial frauds. This division was established in terms of the provisions of Section 55 of the Police Ordinance, with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers and it operates under the exclusive supervision and direction of the Inspector General of Police.?
?There are 64 functional divisions in the Police Department such as the Terrorist Investigation Division, the Criminal Records Division, the Criminal Investigation Division, the Colombo Crimes Division, the Narcotics Bureau, the Child & Women Bureau, the Fraud Investigation Bureau, the Environment Protection Division, etc. In fact, most of these divisions were not there at the very inception of the Police Department. These divisions were established from time to time to cater to the contemporary trends; in the same manner the FCID was established. No special statutory power or mandate has been given to the FCID other than the powers vested with the Police Department. The purpose of establishing this division is to employ the services of experienced officers to handle investigations on financial crimes of a grave nature and expedite those investigations.?
?The Anti-Corruption Committee (ACC) is a Cabinet Sub-Committee headed by the Prime Minister, which was set up on a decision taken at the Cabinet meeting held on January 21, 2015. This Committee was set up with a view to recommending measures to be adopted to prevent the occurrence of large scale corruption and frauds in the future. On the recommendation of the Anti-Corruption Committee and the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers a dedicated Secretariat named Anti-Corruption Committee Secretariat was also established to coordinate the investigations of the allegations on serious frauds, financial crimes and corruption.?
?The Government assures the independence of the investigations carried out by all the law enforcement agencies in the country including the FCID and denies any sort of undue political intervention in the enforcement of law,?

JHU wants reforms before polls
	
	JHU General Secretary and Power and Energy Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka today objected to the upcoming general election being conducted under the current Proportional Representation (PR) System.
	Last week President Maithripala Sirisena had informed the smaller parties that the elections would be held under the present system with the proposed electoral reforms if enacted coming into force for future elections only. ?
	The minister told a news conference held at his office that President Sirisena had pledged to introduce electoral reforms within the 100-day programme of the government.? He said the objective of the 20th Amendment was to scrap the highly criticised and blatantly abused preferential voting system and ensure that every citizen of this country was represented by a Member of Parliament. ?
	?The demand to postpone the electoral reforms and conduct the forthcoming parliamentary polls under the existing PR system is being made for political advantage. The minority and smaller parties that are mainly behind this demand to postpone electoral reforms till after the elections must think nationally and not individually,? he said.
	The minister said the President had given three main pledges at his election campaign -- the first was to abolish the executive presidency or at least prune its absolute powers; the second was to reactivate the independent commissions and the third was to introduce electoral reforms.
	He said the smaller and minority parties had opposed electoral reforms since 2002 despite the popular demand for reforms.
	?The call to postpone electoral reforms till after the general elections can be termed as treacherous and anti-national. Therefore, it is the bounden duty and responsibility of all law makers to support the 20th Amendment to the Constitution,? the minister said. ?Even the JHU may be at a disadvantage when new electoral reforms are introduced. But as politicians who love the country and the people and putting aside personal interests we must support the 20th Amendment to the Constitution and rid the country from the wretched clutches of corrupt politicians and the corrupt electoral system.
	However, he expressed hope that the 20th Amendment would be passed in Parliament with the support of all political parties and added that it? would act as a barometer to test the honesty and integrity of all politicians and their political parties. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)

Jayalalithaa acquitted of corruption charges
	
The Karnataka high court acquitted former Tamil Nadu chief minister and AIADMK supremo? Jayalalithaa Jeyaram in a corruption case, clearing the decks for her return to the state's top job.
According to Hindustan Times, Jayalalithaa had appealed against her conviction in the Rs 66.64-crore disproportionate assets case by a Bengaluru trial court, which had sentenced her to 4 years in jail and slapped a fine of Rs 100 crore.
The AIADMK chief, along with aides N Sasikala, VN Sudhakaran and J Elasvarasi, was held guilty of holding unaccounted for income during her tenure as chief minister from 1991-96 by the trial court in September last year.
Her close aide Sasikala and Sasikala's relatives Sudhakaran and Elavarasi were fined Rs 10 crore each. The lower court had convicted them after a trial lasting 18 long years.
Along with Jayalalithaa, all three others were also acquitted by the high court.
There is consensus across party lines in the state that after her acquittal, Jayalalithaa will now be back with a bang.
"It will be a big blow to all opposition parties," said C Lakshmanan, a professor at the Madras Institute of Development Studies.
"It will be a nightmare for all of them. The AIADMK might have a cakewalk in the 2016 elections. The BJP may not be able to even imagine a hold in Tamil Nadu in their lifetime unless they completely surrender to Amma," he said.
The AIADMK will now want their Amma back in the chief minister's seat as soon as possible.
Rabi Bernard, an AIADMK Rajya Sabha MP and a party spokesperson, said Jayalalithaa will become the chief minister.
"There are only 9 to 10 months to go for elections. The state will go into election mode. Madam will take charge of all election and campaign activities," said Bernard.
The BJP, despite having little presence in the state was confident that it will emerge as an alternative, was watching closely said the judgement will be a game changer.
"It would boost the morale of the AIADMK cadres and the public," said H Raja, a BJP national secretary.
"She enjoyed public support when she was chief minister. That is why this judgement will be a watershed judgement in Tamil Nadu politics.

New laws to safeguard national flag
	
Regulations pertaining to the national flag will be incorporated to the common law of the country through an Act allowing legal action to be taken against those violating it, government sources said. ?
The new laws would target printers and distributers of distorted flags. ?Legal action will be taken against those who print and distribute these flags,? the sources said. ?
The decision was taken after an alleged distorted version of the national flag was used at a protest campaign in front of the Bribery Commission last month. A cabinet paper is to be presented for approval of the new law soon. ?
Convening a meeting at the Home Affairs Ministry last week, government officials directed the CAA to gazette quality standards of the national flag which had been approved by the Sri Lanka Standards Institute.
The customs and the CAA have also been directed to pay special notice to the quality and standard of the flags brought into the country.
Several individuals were arrested on charges of maligning the national flag by displaying a distorted version during a protest held in support of the former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa opposite the Bribery Commission. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Private sector to maintain Galle Face Green?
	
	Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga today instructed officials to come up with a strategic plan in collaboration with the private sector to manage and maintain the Galle Face Green (GFG) without any cost to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA).
	Minister Ranatunga added that the maintenance and operation of the Galle Face Green (GFG) has cost the SLPA Rs. 3.3 million in 2014 without any dividend.
	The monthly progressive assessment meeting of the Ports and Shipping Ministry was held yesterday chaired by Minister Ranatunga.
	Officials informed the Minister that the misdeeds and mismanagement of the GFG by the SLPA has made an opening to certain officials to misuse SLPA resources and also to treat outsiders using SLPA assets.
	They pointed out that maintenance and operations of the GFG has been first carried out by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) and later handed the task over to the government affiliated Sri Lanka Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya. Ultimately the job was given to the SLPA.
	However, the SLPA has failed to generate income properly from the GFG by way of vehicle parking fees and trade stalls. It was also revealed that there had been the misuse of this facility by the SLPA. Minister Ranatunga taking into account of all these lapses ordered to stop charging of vehicles for parking at the GFG in April.
	?I have watched how outsiders collect parking fees from vehicle owners without any authority. They do not send these collections to the SLPA. That is why I put a stop to this and I am extremely happy that motorists had a big relief during the festive season as they were able to park their vehicles at the GFG free of charge,? Minister Ranatunga said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Ravi contradicts CBK's claims
	
	Refuting the claims by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake yesterday said the Treasury has ?enough money? to cover its obligations and fund the ?right? infrastructure projects.
	Addressing a recent meeting organised by the Sri Lanka Development Officers? Union in Colombo, Kumaratunga said the government was facing difficulties due to the depleted finances of the Treasury and was even unable to pay the salaries of public servants.? ?
	While alleging those who opposed good governance had started a counter revolution, she said financial difficulties had been caused by the lack of transparency in the mega projects carried out by the previous government.
	?I believe what she (Kumaratunga) meant by this statement was the dismal situation of the economy the new government inherited. We have enough money,? Karunanayake averred.
	However, he said the bloated payments for mega infrastructure projects and some of the unnecessary tax concessions given by the previous regime have curbed the government?s income.
	?The revenue per gross domestic product has gone down to 10.7 percent,? Karunanayake noted.
	He added that the government?s debt servicing (capital and interest) remains extremely high at Rs.1290 billion compared to the government?s revenue of Rs.1352 billion.
	The government recently sought the Parliament approval to increase the Treasury bill issuance threshold by Rs.400 billion to retire high-cost debt.
	However, the motion was defeated and Karunanayake said it had no impact to government?s day-to-day business.
	He also noted that the improved investment climate in the country due to good governance is attracting more foreign investments and multilateral lenders such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Asian Development Bank (ADB) and World Bank are willing to fund the ?right? projects.
	Meanwhile, responding to a query about the sovereign bond issuance the government was planning Karunanayake said they are waiting for the most appropriate time.
	?We are in no rush. We are waiting for the lowest rate,? he said.
