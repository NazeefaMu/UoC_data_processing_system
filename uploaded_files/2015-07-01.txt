20 Peliyagoda Crime Division officers transferred
	
	More than 20 police personnel attached to the Peliyagoda Crime Division were transferred with immediate effect in connection with the case where a constable attached to the unit was arrested by the STF last month on charges of selling heroin.
	The Peliyagoda Crime Division, a special unit operating under the Western Province North DIG L.G. Kularatne came into the limelight after the constable was nabbed selling heroin to Police Special Task Force officers acting as decoys in a sting operation on June 15.
	A senior police officer said that soon after an inquiry, the DIG took immediate steps to transfer some 20 officers who had completed more than two years in the unit.
	They were replaced by personnel with a unsullied service record drawn from the surrounding stations and units.
	In the wake of the constable's arrest, evidence had revealed that two more police personnel were linked to the trafficking in heroin. The narcotics had been siphoned off from various raids and detections carried out by the unit.
	The senior officer said the transfer of officers who had remained for in particular unit for a long period was essential to discourage unlawful activities they might be led to commit. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

?What is the political party from which you propose to contest the next election?? the friend asked the Ministerial one.
?I will contest under the Betel leaf symbol.?
?You are keen on winning. Aren?t you?? the friend inquired again. ?Certainly,? the Ministerial colleague replied.
?Then may I give some good advice as a good friend??
?Of course, you may!? replied the Ministerial one.?
?If you follow my advice, you will have a good chance of winning the election,? said the friend on the hospital bed. ?Stop berating my elder brother and my family members because if you attack them, you will lose the votes of all SLFPers!?

The New Big Boss the other day invited the secretarial bigwigs who served his predecessor to his secretariat. He had wanted to meet the former triumvirate for a specific purpose: to consult them on how to expeditiously and effectively translate his concept of a yahapalanaya into a reality.?
The New Big Boss came out with a litany of problems he had been encountering from the time he assumed office and in conclusion had asked the former Big Three to express their candid opinion on measures being taken under his dispensation to usher in the elusive yahapalanya.?
The one-time bigwig who served as the secretarial one to the deposed strongman was to speak up first: ?Sir, you know that I was the highest white collar bigwig in the state sector. I only carried out the orders that came from above. Now Police are asking me why I carried out certain orders!?
The former bigwig continued to address an attentive New Boss: ?I can resign myself to being questioned, if at the least the questioner is the IGP. ?But, Sir, how can we provide answers when we are being questioned by PCs who know next to nothing about the matters they question us on??
The New Big Boss quietly listened as the bigwig continued with his tale of woe. ?If this state of affairs continued, there would be none in the public sector with a genuine commitment to render some service to the country,? he added.

A sizable crowd of former Ministers, provincial councillors and members of local bodies in the area had turned up at the Pooja to demonstrate their solidarity with their one-time boss. ?However, conspicuous by his absence was a provincial chief elevated to his present status by the deposed strongman.
However, the provincial chief was seen making an eleventh-hour appearance at the Maligawa through a rear entrance as the deposed strongman stepped into the inner shrine. ?The provincial chief had later approached the former strongman and apologised to him for being late, but the latter had ignored him knowing that the late comer was just marking his attendance.

His bid to end holiday to ethanol imports fails!
	
Ethanol was a much hackneyed topic at opposition election rallies in the recent past. Some powerful politicians were branded as ethanol racketeers and promises were galore at that time that they would soon be brought to book. But it is no secret that ethanol business continues to flourish as before.
Ethanol being a base product for the manufacture of two different products as far apart as beauty and beast -- ?cosmetics and hard liquor has provided a convenient cover for ethanol racketeers, they say.
All that is by the way!
A prominent high up in the yahapalanaya government recently presented a proposal at a decision-making body to authorise the issue of permits for import of ethanol for the manufacture of cosmetics. The new Big Boss in the chair had immediately shot down the proposal saying allowing ethanol imports even for a harmless purpose would only bring the government to disrepute. The high up, of course, did not press the matter, they say.

Hyatt heist!
	
	-Initial cost of Rs. 13 b doubles due to massive mismanagement including?-Rs. 5 b EPF funds-Former board had no formal meetings, contracts doled out with no tender procedure?-Rs. 300 m spent on H?tota Hyatt even before start, project to be cancelled by new officials?-Colombo Hyatt to open by 2017 after three-year delay
	A forensic audit into the Hyatt hotels in Colpetty and Hambantota has uncovered mass fraud resulting in initial cost estimates more than doubling from Rs. 13 billion to Rs. 27 billion and the company facing a shortfall of nearly Rs. 9 billion to complete the project, its new director board said yesterday.?
	Canwill Holdings Ltd. is a fully state-owned public enterprise that was initiated under former President Mahinda Rajapaksa?s tenure. It was entrusted with Rs. 18.5 billion in equity sourced from its key shareholders Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, which contributed Rs. 8.5 billion as well as Litro Gas and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) that provided Rs. 5 billion respectively.?
	Forty-six percent of the shares were held by Sri Lanka Insurance while the rest was divided between Litro Gas and EPF.?
	Canwill Holdings then invested its equity in two subsidiaries, Sinolanka Hotel and Spa, which was behind the Hyatt hotel in Colpetty and Helanco Hotels and Spa that backed the proposed Hyatt in Hambantota.?
	?The Hyatt in Colombo has been under construction for over three years. During the audit we uncovered instances of massive wastage and mismanagement right from the inception of obtaining the land. Three additional properties were acquired by paying Rs. 40 million more than was suggested by the Government Valuer at the behest of the company,? new Chairman Hemaka Amarasuriya told reporters but assured the company has sufficient funds to ?carry on for now.? ?
	The main land was leased for 99 years from the Urban Development Authority (UDA) after the former Ceylinco property was controversially expropriated by the previous government. Canwill Holdings was previously managed by former Chairman Gamini Senerath and former Managing Director Piyadasa Kudabalage and the audit report found no regular board meetings had been held with major decisions taken via email, Amarasuriya said.?
	Among the host of irregularities and mismanagement highlighted by the audit were payments of Rs. 10 million to a lawyer with no agreement, Rs. 16 million losses in steel purchases, fittings supplier given Rs. 80 million without board approval, international tender for $ 37 million signed with an international contractor the day before the presidential elections and Rs. 12.8 million spent on a signing ceremony. ?An additional Rs. 300million had been spent from Rs. 5 billion earmarked for the Hambantota Hyatt without even the foundation stone being laid for the project. The new board plans to revert the remaining funds to complete the Colpetty Hyatt and cancel the project in Rajapaksa?s hometown. Many of the contracts were handed on personal basis without open tenders, the audit report found.?
	A bag of foreign consultants were also appointed to the interior design, restaurants, food services, laundry, lighting, lifts, landscape and facade that have been combed through by the new board and largely dismissed. A foreign engineering consultant was also hired at Rs. 16 million a month, which the new board has terminated. A corporate credit card with a limit of Rs.1.5 million was issued to the former managing director and both his children were employed by Canwill Holdings with special perks, charged Amarasuriya. The results of the audit will have handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of police.?
	?So far we have saved about Rs.150 million by cancelling and renegotiating contracts. This work will continue and we hope to save an additional Rs. 100 million. Tenders have already been called for fresh work and we will work to ensure transparency. It is essential for the public to know about this wastage as it involves public funds,? he added.?
	A foreign general manager was hired for a salary of Rs. 1.4 million but he has been sent back to Hyatt by the new board of directors as his services would not be immediately needed. However, Amarasuriya was quick to assure no oversights had been found in connection to the management and profit sharing agreement signed between Canwill Holdings and Hyatt International. The new opening date for Hyatt Colombo has been extended to 2017. The agreement was initially entered to by Hyatt Hotels Corporation in 2012 and it was to have been completed in 2014.

Indian Ocean is not India's alone: China
	
The Indian Ocean cannot be a backyard of India which navies of other countries could not visit, the Chinese ministry of defence has said.
As the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy expands its profile in the Indian Ocean with recent submarine visits to Sri Lanka and more recently Pakistan, its officials have moved to assuage India's concerns by emphasising its motivations were driven by trade and security and not aimed at India, Indian media reported.
Senior Captain Zhao Yi told visiting Indian journalists in Beijing on Tuesday that India had a "special role to play in stabilising the Indian Ocean region", but it could not be treated as its backyard.
"I admit that geographically speaking India has a special role to play in stabilising the Indian Ocean region and South Asian region. But [for the Indian Ocean], backyard is not a very appropriate word to use for an open sea and international areas of sea," he said.
He said if the Indian side views the Indian Ocean as its backyard, it cannot explain why navies from Russia, the United States and Australia have the right of free navigation in Indian Ocean.
He said one American scholar had warned of the possibility of "clashes" in the Indian Ocean. "I don't agree," Senior Captain Zhao said, but added: "If some countries view it as their backyard, then this [possibility] could not be eliminated."
The Chinese experts did, however, acknowledge the need for more transparency, especially in the wake of concerns in Indian strategic circles over submarine visits by the PLAN to Sri Lanka last year and to Pakistan earlier this year. China described both visits as routine.
"When most submarines navigate we inform our neighbouring countries to reduce concerns and enhance mutual trust," said Zhang Wei, Researcher of the PLA Navy Academic Institute. Zhang added that China's attention on the Indian Ocean Region was driven by trade, with key energy imports passing through the waters. "The Chinese navy's presence in the Indian Ocean is to protect maritime security and of sealines of communication. We should make efforts to strengthen trust. If there are still doubts and concerns of navigation in the Indian Ocean then I believe we haven't done enough to enhance mutual trust," said Zhang.? (Business Standard and India Today)

Former Indian President Abdul Kalam, better known as an eminent scientist was on a three-day visit here last week to attend the Energy symposium in Colombo organised by the Power and?Energy Ministry.?
Despite Kalam being a person used to a simple lifestyle, the organisers of the event to which he was invited as the Chief Guest, had to provide him with security and facilities befitting a former Head of State. Therefore, they requested the Foreign Affairs authorities to provide, among other things, a limousine for the Indian dignitary to travel about during his visit to the country.?
The Foreign Affairs authorities agreed to place a vehicle at the disposal of the foreign visitor for the whole visit, but at a hire charge of Rs.90, 000 a day! ?
The officials handed the missive from the foreign authorities to the Minister who took the initiative to organise the function and also invite Kalam to grace the occasion and the latter discarded the missive with disdain and retorted angrily: ?How ridiculous! To pay Rs.90,000 as hire for a day!??
The organisers later obtained a vehicle from the President?s transport division on the instructions of the Minister.?
The Minister still smarting under ?the insolent demand? by the ?Foreign Affairs authorities inquired as to why they charge such an exorbitant amount as hire for an official vehicle for the use of a visiting foreign dignitary. And he was shocked by the reply he received from a Foreign Affairs bigwig.
