'All is forgiven': PM says returning SL asylum seekers won't be charged
	
Sri Lankas prime minister has urged compatriots who are being held in Australian-run immigration detention centres to come home.
Ranil Wickremesinghe claimed the Sri Lankans had broken the law in trying to flee to Australia but insisted they would not face prosecution if they returned.
Come back. All is forgiven, Wickremesinghe said as he stood beside Malcolm Turnbull in Canberra on Wednesday.
Asked about those who might prefer to remain in the camps than return in fear for their safety, he insisted they were mistaken, pointing to a newly established missing persons office in his country.
Some of them have left from places where conflict didnt even take place, Wickremesinghe said. All of them are not even Tamils and even we want all the Tamils to come back. We should not make a mess of ourselves like theyve gone and done in Europe and the Middle East.
They left Sri Lanka illegally. They are welcome to return to Sri Lanka and we wont prosecute them, so they can come back to Sri Lanka, and we will have them, but remember, they broke the law in coming to Australia, attempting to come to Australia.
When asked by reporters whether it was safe for asylum seekers to return, Wickremesinghe said: We just started a missing persons office. It is quite safe for them to come back.
Australia and Sri Lanka shared a number of bonds through their history, Wickremesinghe said.
Sri Lanka and Australia have shared a common past. There are many values we inherited from the British empire to which we added our own values, and Australia today is one of the leading members of the Asia-Pacific region.

Beyond cricket, speak on accountability with Lankan PM: HRW
	
The Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it hoped Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull would ask some hard questions about the accountability measures taking place in Sri Lanka, beyond friendly cricket matches, with the visiting Sri Lankan Prime Minister.
Issuing a statement yesterday, HRW Australia Director Elaine Pearson said victims and their families still await justice seven years after the horrific end to Sri Lankas long civil war. 
She said the Sri Lankan government agreed to the 2015 UNHRC resolution that mandates the creation of various transitional justice mechanisms, including a way to provide accountability for war crimes that envisions international involvement.
This was a positive change in approach, and next month the Sri Lankan government is due to report on what progress it has made. Certainly there have been a number of positive developments in Sri Lanka. Civil society groups are once again able to speak out safely on issues of concern, she said.
However, while progress has been made in many areas, key commitments have not been met, she said.
She said the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) remains in force and there have been several arrests under this law in the past year.
Moreover, many people imprisoned under this law were charged after allegedly being tortured to confess. The government has still not put forward a plan to provide redress for those unjustly detained under the PTA,Ms. Pearson said.
She said a government appointed task force reported in January that communities favour international participation in a justice process. Despite its inclusion in the Human Rights Council resolution, President Maithripala Sirisena has increasingly spoken out against foreign judges and other international involvement.
Australia has a mixed record on Human Rights Council resolutions promoting human rights in Sri Lanka. It seems that Australia sided with the previous Rajapaksa government in opposition to earlier resolutions largely because of border security. According to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Australian governments silence on rights abuses was the price it paid to secure cooperation from the Rajapaksa government on stopping asylum-seeker boats. However, with the election of a new government in Sri Lanka, Australia changed its tune and was among the co-sponsors of the crucial 2015 resolution, Ms. Pearson said.
With Australia vying for a seat at the UN Human Rights Council in 2018-2020, she said the international community will be taking particular interest in whether it supports human rights in the Asia-Pacific region.
Turnbull should urge Wickremesinghe to ensure that victims  who have given testimony to several official commissions, braved surveillance and threats, and waited for information about missing loved ones  get the answers they have long been seeking, and that it happens as soon as possible.
Foreign judges and prosecutors can play a significant role in ensuring independence and impartiality in accountability mechanisms for wartime abuses. Turnbull would do well to offer Sri Lanka help in this regard and, given Australias long friendly relations and Commonwealth status, Wickremesinghe might just accept it, the HRW Director said.

Blues and Greens in tug o war over reshuffle
	

The Green party is reportedly insisting that the proposed reshuffle of the top team in yahapalanaya be deferred indefinitely and the Blue faction in the government is unhappy over the inordinate delay.

The Blue faction pressing their demand for a reshuffle allege that doings of certain top team members from the Green party have placed the very survival of the unity government in jeopardy. However, Number One has taken up the position that a reshuffle has to be carried out with the consent of both major constituent parties in yahapalanaya.
Meanwhile, highly disappointed Blues who met the other day specially to discuss the issue had unanimously decided to publicly slam the two top team members allegedly bringing the government into disrepute while pressing their demand with renewed vigour.
We dont propose to become the butt of public anger over the wrong doings of the disrespectable duo. Therefore, we have planned to appear on public platforms together to expose them  tell the world who they are! a spokesman for the unhappy Blues said.

Deep-rooted Friendship, Mutually Beneficial Cooperation and a Prosperous Future
	
China and Sri Lanka are close neighbours enjoying traditional friendship. As early as 410 AD, the famous Chinese (Fa Hsien) travelled to Sri Lanka, acquired Buddhist texts and preached Buddhism in the Island country for two years. The journey of Fa Xian ushered in the long history of friendly exchanges and communication between the two ancient civilizations. In the 15th century before the western great discoveries of geography, Chinese navigator Zheng He voyaged along the ancient maritime silk route and landed in Sri Lanka 5 times. His journey further linked China and Sri Lanka. Today we can still trace this very history to the China Bay in Trincomalee, Eastern Province of Sri Lanka. We are proud of our ancestors long time engagement with each other and confident of the future development of the China-Sri Lanka Traditional Friendship. 
Sustained Friendship based on Mutual Respect, Mutual Trust and Equality and Mutual Benefit
This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka and the 65th anniversary of the signing of the Rubber--Rice Pact. Sixty five years ago, in the background of the cold war, our two countries determined to sign the Rubber--Rice Pact with each other despite western objections, opening a door for the two traditional friends to communicate with and support each other again. On 7th February 1957, China and Sri Lanka established diplomatic ties and continued the deep-rooted friendship.

When we talk about China-Sri Lanka relations, most people of both countries will speak of the historical moment in 1957 when Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai made the public speech at the Independence Square in the rain and the historical moment in 1971 when Sri Lankan Prime Minister Madam Bandaranaike presented the baby elephant Mitura to the Chinese people. Such precious friendship has been handed down from generation to generation and enhanced ever since. Over the six decades since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the bilateral relations have always maintained a sound and steady development. China and Sri Lanka have carried out cooperation by upholding the principle of equality and mutual benefits, aiming to bring tangible benefits to the two peoples. China always attaches importance on its relations with Sri Lanka in its neighbourhood diplomacy and stands ready to make joint efforts with Sri Lanka to deepen mutually beneficial cooperation in all fields and promote the bilateral strategic and cooperative partnership featuring sincere mutual assistance and everlasting friendship to a new height. Regardless of the changing international landscape and internal politics of both nations, the Chinese government and people have maintained an intimate traditional friendship with Sri Lanka. Nowadays, China-Sri Lanka relations have become a model of friendly exchanges between countries. 
Strategic Cooperative Partnership Grows with Renewed vigour and Vitality
In recent years, China-Sri Lanka relations have entered into a new era of strategic cooperative partnership. Since the end of the internal conflict in 2009, Sri Lanka has been on the sound track of political stability and social harmony. Reconstruction and reconciliation have progressed smoothly, resulting in rapid economic and social development and significant improvement of peoples livelihood. China welcomes the tangible and significant progress made in addressing the challenges of post-conflict development and stands unswervingly with Sri Lanka on the path of reconstruction and development. 
In September 2014, Chinese President H.E. Xi Jinping paid a state visit to Sri Lanka, which is the first ever during the past 28 years, opening a new chapter of China-Sri Lanka relations. Six months later, in March 2015, Sri Lankan President H.E. Maithripala Sirisena conducted a state visit to China shortly after resuming office, which consolidated and deepened China-Sri Lanka friendly cooperative ties. In April and August, 2016, Hon. Ranil Wickramasinghe visited China twice and reached a lot of consensus with the Chinese leaders on further enhancing mutually beneficial cooperation. 
Today, BMICH, Nelum Pokuna Theatre and the Supreme Court Complex etc., donated and constructed by China in the past decades witness the Chinese peoples unselfish contribution to Sri Lankan people. Mega projects such as Colombo South Container Terminal, Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, Colombo-Katunayake Expressway, Southern Expressway, A9 road, Mattala International Airport, and Phase one of Hanmbantota Port and three China-Sri Lanka Friendship Villages have become the new landmarks of China-Sri Lanka friendship. Chinas Support has laid an indispensable basis for the development of Sri Lanka which has now became one of the most vibrant developing countries with prominent prospects. 
Up to now, China has provided preferential loans amounting to more than RMB 40 billion (over Rs. 800 billion) and donations worth more than RMB 10 billions (over Rs. 200 billion) to Sri Lanka. The two countries enterprises have worked together and constructed a lot of mega projects which benefit Sri Lankan development and the peoples livelihood. Those projects have also created more than 100 thousand job opportunities for the local people, trained tens of thousands of technicians and managers, and promoted the rapid development of various sectors. 
China has been Sri Lankas second-largest tourism source market since 2014. In 2016, Sri Lanka received more than 270 thousand arrivals from China, up 26.8 percent year-on-year. The number of Chinese tourists to Sri Lanka is on an upward curve, which stands for the deepening and enlarging of people to people exchanges between our two countries. It is also a new fashion for Sri Lankans to do business, travel and study in China. Last year, China provided more than 1000 scholarships and training opportunities to Sri Lanka ranging from academic study to language training, professional training, etc. Government officials at different levels, businessmen, professionals, students and tourists are conducting more and more interactions and communications among each other, which will definitely enhance the understanding and friendship between our two peoples. 

The exchanges and cooperation between China and Sri Lanka, are fraternal and mutually beneficial, which has established a model for south-south cooperation. And the China-Sri Lanka strategic cooperative partnership has been growing stronger and stronger. 
Bright future with Joint construction of the 21st Maritime Silk Route
The China-Sri Lanka friendship, nurtured by generations of the leaders of both countries and personages from all circles and treasuries and cherished by the two peoples, should be earnestly and everlastingly inherited, maintained and developed. 
As an important stop of the ancient Maritime Silk Route, Sri Lanka had witnessed the prosperous era in the history. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the national government have made a clear development blueprint for Sri Lanka. We believe that with the joint efforts of the government and people, Sri Lanka will surely realize its aspiration. 
On the way forward, China will always stand with Sri Lanka and spare no efforts to mutually create a more brilliant tomorrow for our bilateral relations and to realize the dreams of our two countries.
Currently, China and Sri Lanka is on the journey of jointly constructing the 21st Century Maritime Silk Route. The Chinese side would like to maximize the synergy of each others respective development strategies under the framework of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Route to achieve mutual benefits and common development.  China will continue to preserve the strong development momentum of bilateral relations. We are willing to maintain close high-level exchanges, strengthen friendly exchanges between political parties and governmental departments of both sides and constantly consolidate and enhance political mutual trust. We are willing to implement the important consensus reached by both leaders together with Sri Lanka, accelerate the alignment of development strategies and forge the upgraded version of bilateral cooperation and development and jointly push for constant progress of China-Sri Lanka relations so that both peoples can benefit more from bilateral cooperation. 
China will continue to encourage Chinese companies to invest in Sri Lanka, and actively participate in the projects like construction and management of ports and neighbouring industrial zones, transportation infrastructure, and processing and manufacturing industry, etc., and jointly foster new economic growth points of bilateral economic cooperation. China will fullfill its promises to assist Sri Lanka to carry out livelihood projects such as the Kidney Disease Hospital, the Outpatient Department of National Hospital and the Water Quality Monitoring Centre. 
China will continue to enhance the people to people exchanges with Sri Lanka. As a Chinese saying goes, the relationship between two countries is based on the affection between two countries civilians. China will continue to support the Sri Lankan side to conduct tourism promotion in China, encourage Chinese citizens to travel in Sri Lanka, support the airline companies to open more direct flights, and facilitate people to people engagement and trade exchanges. China will continue to provide scholarships and trainingships for Sri Lankans and support the exchanges and cooperation between universities, think tanks, media and Buddhism societies of the two countries, and enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples. 
There are endless stories and wonderful prospects for the friendship and cooperation between China and Sri Lanka. We believe that China-Sri Lanka relations will usher in a more beautiful and bright future. The friendly cooperation between China and Sri Lanka will definitely bear more fruits and bring tangible benefits to the two peoples. 
May the friendship between China and Sri Lanka be everlasting!

He said that students of his institution were provided clinical training at the government hospitals only after making a payment of Rs 50,000 per subject and they would not agree to the already graduated students being given this clinical training once again.
If the Medical Council ignores the court order and refuses to register the medical graduates, these students might file action in court for contempt of court, he said.
During a discussion the deans of all medical faculties had with the Higher Education Ministry recently, it had been decided to suspend the enrolment of new students to SAITM for six months, and for the students who had passed out to undergo clinical training and sit for an examination conducted by the Medical Council.

Fitch reaffirms Peoples Bank at AA+(lka) with Stable outlook
	
Fitch Ratings Lanka Limited recently reaffirmed the National Long Term Rating on Peoples Bank at AA+(lka) with a Stable outlook - continuing to put the institution amongst the two highest rated locally incorporated commercial banks in the country on a national scale.
In its rating announcement the agency stated, The National Long-Term Rating of Peoples Bank reflects Fitchs expectation of extraordinary support from the sovereign (B+/Negative) albeit constrained by its limited ability.
Fitch expects support for Peoples Bank to stem from its high systemic importance, quasi-sovereign status, role as key lenders to the government and full state ownership.
Commenting on the affirmation, Peoples Bank Chairman Hemasiri Fernando stated, The evolution of the banks rating provides a simple but powerful testimony to an irrefutable fact. Having been rated A- (lka) during 2008, to having received an industry unprecedented systematic five-notch upgrade to reach AA+ (lka) by the end of 2012 and a capacity to consistently maintain this credit quality thereafter since, notwithstanding the many challenges from a macroeconomic stand point, self attests to both the consistent and sustained positive progress made by the institution over the years.
As for 2016, it will be a year etched in our history books for many reasons. Amongst them all, it will be best remembered as the year that witnessed not only a single trillion-rupee feat but in fact two.
Following its first trillion-rupee landmark achievement in terms of consolidated group assets in 2013, during the year 2016, the bank saw not only its customer deposits reach this historic milestone but also its group customer advances.
This provides ample evidence to our standing within the industry - supported by our unmatched network of branches spread across all major cities and suburbs in the country. Must be also said, amongst our many successes, we are also most proud to be the industrys largest employer.
The passion and commitment of our employees to serve the people of the nation and their businesses is what consciously and very diligently drives us forward. We thank you all. On behalf of the board of directors, I take the opportunity to extend our sincerest appreciation to all our valued stakeholders for their trust and confidence in our efforts.
Commenting on the banks performance, Peoples Bank Chief Executive Officer/General Manager Vasantha Kumar stated, Our delivery amidst challenging circumstances remains best described in two simple but primary indicators.
First, an industry benchmark return on equity of over 20 percent delivered consistently since 2014 and second, a consciously and very diligently reduced gross non-performing loan ratio to less than 2.0 percent - which is not only our 10-year low but also amongst the lowest in the industry.
Not complacent with our successes and conscious of the challenges that may lie ahead, our focus is clear and is to make every effort necessary and within our reasonable control to help all our customers and their businesses continuously prosper.

The top team member who took the initiative to lay out this garden has claimed that it cost the exchequer Rs.306 million. However, villagers in the area say the real total cost should be much less than this figure.
Villagers also claim that in the process of laying out the garden, the drain system of the expressway running alongside the garden was badly damaged.

H. Soma Weerakone A great man, a great scout and a great father
	
BY Janaprith Fernando
Lord Baden Powell in his Last Message said  But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best
Sri Lankas former Chief Scouts Commissioner Soma Weerakone, who was called to a higher service on February 8, 2017, during his life time did exactly this. He joined the scout movement as a Cub Scout at Anuruddha College in Nawalapitiya and moved to St Marys College, Nawalapitiya where he continued as a scout. Thereafter he joined the Rock Mount Rover Crew and started his career in the Water Works Department in Nawalapitiya. He was later transferred and served in Kandy, Avissawella and Chilaw. In Chilaw he served the Scout Movement as a Scout Leader.
Thereafter he was transferred to Colombo. The late Mr R. Bodinagoda, a former District Commissioner of Colombo, was his guru and knowing Mr Weerakone and his capabilities approached him to join the Colombo District Scouts and appointed him as an Assistant District Commissioner (ADC). He was the Organising Commissioner of the Colombo Camporee in 1978. He continued to serve as an ADC and was appointed as the District Commissioner of Colombo in 1984. He served in this capacity till 1989 and was elected as the Chairman of the Executive Committee of Colombo.
After serving a brief period in this office he was appointed as an Assistant Chief Commissioner of the Sri Lanka Scout Association where he handled many subjects including International Affairs.
Mr Weerakone was appointed Deputy Chief Commissioner 1997 and organized the 5th National Jamboree in Kandy in 1998. In 2002 he was appointed as the Chief Commissioner of the Sri Lanka Scout Association (SLSA). Under his leadership the National Jamboree was held in Nuwara Eliya together with the SAARC camp and the SAARC Chief Commissioners meeting hosted by Sri Lanka.
I came to know Mr Weerakone in 1982 when I was only a junior scout of 14 years. I was absorbed to serve in the Camporee Souvenir Team and Mr Weerakone after the Camporee hosted a dinner to which I too was invited. I was touched by his humility and hospitality because I recall him talking to me on a number of occasions during the function to find out how I was and that made me feel very special. This is a great quality he had where he was able to relate to both the young and the old alike. I have worked with him since then and he always said and treated me like one of his sons. He would be the first to call and wish me whenever I achieved something either in scouting or in my profession. There was one Christmas card which would reach me by post every year and up to 2016 he did not fail to send this greeting card. As Scout Leaders we have had several heated arguments at meetings, sometimes I am sure he may have got hurt to realize that I was arguing with him. He never took anything out of the meeting room nor held any grudges but on the contrary would invite me to join him for a bite at the 80 Club. He has never missed a single meeting of the Scout Council if he is in Sri Lanka and would contribute positively at discussions.
I have received so many messages of Condolences from all scouting nations and leaders of the Asia Pacific Region and they have said what a great scout leader and a friend he was to all of them and how the Scouting world would miss him. They sent their deepest sympathies and condolences to the family and the SLSA.
Mr Weerakone has won several Awards and Medals from the King of Thailand, Prince of Japan and the President of Sri Lanka.
That is the great man, great Scout and a great father Soma Weerakone was. To me he was a mentor, godfather and a respected scout leader.
Let me quote from the great song writer  Irving Berlin of USA  The Song is ended, but the Melody lingers on Mr Soma Weerakone sir, May you attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana and as I believe May Your Soul Rest in Peace

The politico presiding over the countrys popular game at national level has thrown the functioning of the body controlling the game into a melting pot by becoming a law unto himself, they say.

Often bragging that he is on the way to a much higher political office, the politico is reportedly poking his nose into all affairs to the annoyance of those working with dedication to promote the game.

Even the Master Blaster who is handling the task of selecting the team making necessary changes now and then too has found the politicos meddling and his overbearing attitude intolerable and has sent in his resignation in utter disgust.

A city denizen, the state one represents a constituency in Pulatisipura area. Once a Blue, he has turned Green now. Although he has got a subject relevant to the people he represents, he has just to stand and stare as his boss in the top team has hogged all powers and functions attached to the subject.
The plaintive cries raised by him time and again about being reduced to a nonentity had fallen on deaf ears of those in the highest echelons. 
The state one who began pouring his heart out to the former senior purohita told him: Aiya, I have had enough of this step-motherly treatment. Take some decisive action without further delay so that I can consider doing my share
The Blue senior had greeted this offer with a loud guffaw as usual and replied: Ohoma yang, Malli. After all, the planetary change too has come and gone. Hasnt it

HNB launches Smart Pay card for Lankan schools
	
HNB Senior Card Centre Senior Manager Roshantha Jayatunge presents a ceremonial copy of the first HNB Smart Pay card to D.S. Senanayake College Principal R.M.M. Ratnayake

Sri Lankas most technologically innovative bank, Hatton National Bank (HNB) partnered with D.S. Senanayake College to launch Smart Pay  a revolutionary new proprietary card that will completely redesign payments and attendance recording in schools.
The official launch of HNB Smart Pay was timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary celebrations of D.S. Senanayake College. Utilizing near-field communication (NFC) technology, HNB Smart Pay will enable students to simply tap their cards on specially designed devices placed strategically around the school in order to record their attendance each morning as they enter the school.
The 50th anniversary celebrations and Smart Pay launch event were graced by the presence President Maithripala Sirisena and several other distinguished dignitaries.
The Smart Pay prepaid card, which is being made available to all students regardless of whether they own an HNB bank account, will also enable students to make digital payments within the school premises  from canteen purchases to buying textbooks and stationary supplies from the school bookshop and even covering payment of school fees. 
HNB has long been a pioneer in the introduction of cutting-edge technology into the Sri Lankan banking industry. In that regard, the launch of HNB Smart Pay for schools is another bold step forward in our digital journey that we believe will empower school children by teaching them how to save and spend responsibly within a cashless payment ecosystem. We invite all of Sri Lankas educational institutions to join hands with us on similar initiatives to make this technology-led vision a reality, HNB Chief Digital Officer Sidath Wijeratne explained.
Designed in accordance with the most comprehensive international security standards and protocols, HNB Smart Pay card can be topped up at any HNB branch, through the banks Internet and mobile banking platforms, at HNB ATMs or at any of the HNB point-of-sales (POS) devices placed at strategic locations inside the school premises.
The topping up process for HNB Smart Pay was also designed with convenience in mind. Parents will receive automated notifications whenever the card runs low on funds and a further notification every time the card is topped up, thereby ensuring that parents have full visibility into their childrens spending habits.  
Notably, the Smart Pay card is also capable of linking with HNB Singithi savings accounts for children, enabling students to transfer any pocket money that they have saved up to their account, helping them to save more and win valuable prizes.
In developing HNB Smart Pay our goal above all else was to create a holistic solution capable of meeting the specific needs of a school environment on multiple levels and in that regard we are very proud of the results that we have achieved.
Through HNB Smart Pay, we have been able to offer a product that can help the school to track attendance and very soon, even monitor library book borrowing while at the same time, helping students to make payments quickly, easily and accurately, enabling them to make the most of their interval by wasting less time in the canteen.
Since payments through the student card can only be made within the school premises, this also gives parents an added sense of security. We are confident that this card will be the first step in bridging the digital divide in our schools and we therefore warmly invite all other schools to come on board with HNB Smart Pay, HNB Senior Manager Card Centre Roshantha Jayatunge said.

A young talkative Green party state purohita hailing from the Colombo district and well known for his holier-than-thou attitude has launched the construction work on a massive hotel project on the Hantana hill in Kandy.

This hotel project launched with callous disregard for the ecological balance of the terrain has also become a big nuisance to the people residing in the vicinity of the construction site.
The harried residents in the locality have planned to make representations to both Number One and Number Two against the ongoing hotel project. They have also decided to stage a massive protest if the two high political authorities fail to address their representations.
Residents say that the state one appears to be taking much more interest in this venture than his subject and the project has already caused much damage to the environment.

Indias  Supreme Court convicts AIADMK supremo Sashikala
	

The Supreme Court on Tuesday found AIADMK general secretary VK Sasikala guilty in a 21-year-old disproportionate assets case and asked her to surrender immediately. 
Shes been sentenced to four years in jail and also asked to pay a fine of Rs 10 crore. 
The judgment also bars Sasikala from holding a public office and contesting elections for 6 years, strengthening the hand of caretaker Chief Minister O Panneerselvam, who is locked in a bitter power struggle with her. 
The order also vindicates governor C Vidyasagar Raos decision to delay calling Sasikala to form the government in the southern state that has been facing political uncertainty for days. 
Rao was criticised for encouraging horse trading and doing the Centres bidding in denying Sasikala a fair shot at the top job. 
Sasikala was accused number two; in the Rs 66-crore disproportionate assets case.

Lady at the bar picture goes viral
	

This lady who once held very high office in the country has also been a controversial figure.

While travelling past Union Place the other day, she got the driver to stop the vehicle opposite a supermarket. She got down and walked into the supermarket with her security detail at her heels. Thereafter, she made a beeline to the foreign liquor bar. She was inspecting the rare brands of quality liquor when she suddenly noticed that a youth was carefully focusing the video camera of his mobile phone on her. This sent the lady into a flutter and she barked an order to her security men to catch the youth.
Taking advantage of the seconds taken by the security to swing into action, the youth bolted and disappeared in the milling street crowd. 
By the time, the highly upset lady reached her official residence, video clips showing her at the foreign liquor counter had already appeared on social media websites!

Learning should be through motivation
	

The Dailymirrorsat with National Education Commission (NEC) Chairman Prof. Lakshman Jayathilaka to discuss the General Education Reforms following the presentation of NECs final report to President Maithripala Sirisena recently. Excerpts:

Q What is the solution to thousands of school leavers joining the job market
The school system is responsible for the development of every child who enters it. Education should enable students to charter their future in an increasingly competitive world. School leavers should be an important concern of the school and the education system, and every school leaver should be well-advised about career prospects and after-school choices before they go through general guidelines. The NECs proposal for a national policy on general education contains principals on how students should be treated by schools. Schools will be declared by the government to be the education service providers to their respective communities.
Q Many educational psychologists claim the grade five scholarship exam is too much for a ten-year-old. What do you think
The matter needs serious reviewing and the child should be relieved from the pressure of competition. The purpose of the scholarship examination is to enable capable and talented students from relatively disadvantaged schools to join school with better resources. The idea of having disadvantaged schools in our system is certainly obnoxious and should be discontinued. The focus should be on that aspect. Parental, school and media pressure on children should be eliminated.
Q Have you drawn attention to the competition among parents and students to pass the scholarship exam with higher marks
Yes. It is a very unhealthy state of affairs that hinders the emotional development of the child.
Q How can we end the competition among parents to admit their children in so-called prestigious schools
Restricting classes and school population to internationally accepted norms. Supporting less-popular schools and developing new ones to serve the need of the local populace. Schools should be in easily accessible locations. So-called prestigious schools are not many when compared to the total number, and the education system they follow is not much different from that of what ordinary schools follow. As in the other schools, students have to depend on private tuition to prepare themselves for public examinations. With many of the students having to travel in school vans, there is a high probability of them being adversely affected, both physically and mentally.
Q People believe a child must excel in at least one foreign language and IT to become successful. Do you agree
This is a wrong approach. Although knowing a foreign language, especially English, and being tech-savvy are beneficial, they are not central to learning. These skills should be provided at every school at appropriate levels, rather than compulsion to excel. Learning should be through motivation and most importantly a happy experience for the child.
Q Private tuition has become a multi-billion rupee business today. Despite 4 out of 4.5 million students attending tuition classes, there is no monitoring mechanism for this big business. Why
There is very little social resistance to the growth of private tuition. The immediate task is to ensure that the tutories are made responsible for the protection of the child. Until excessive competition in solely examination-based assessment is eliminated from procedures for admission to higher learning, people will resort to means of improving examination performance. There is much for the education system and student assessment system to do, and for the parents to learn about the purpose of education.
Q What is NECs policy on international schools
They will remain as long as there is demand. The NECs task is to seek ways to ensure that private schools provide proper education and guidance to children. The only possible approach at present is to bring private schools under the wing of the national education system. A regulatory mechanism should be put in place.
Q What reforms would you suggest for grade five, GCE O/L and A/L curricula
The pressure on students to perform should be eased. Extensive recommendations have been made in connection with syllabi and other aspects of curricula. Policy Proposal 93 contains specific recommendations in this respect.
Q What are the reforms needed in the sports sector of a school
There is a need to develop extra-curricular activities. It should be made mandatory for students to engage in two or more extra-curricular activities. The school should be provided with human and material resources. Sports should be for enjoyment and should be accessible to all. Policy Proposal 94 is specific about encouragement of students with aptitude for sports and other extra-curricular interests.
Q At GCE A/L classes, teachers have to deal with adults. What are your thoughts
The duration of schooling could be curtailed by up to two years and there are proposals to that effect. The problem of adolescence has always existed even with much younger students. The only way forward for any school is for the teacher and pupil to build good social relations so that it would instill faith and confidence on both sides.
However, the NEC report on general education and its recommendations are accessible to the public via the website nec.gov.lk. We encourage public comment on every aspect of the report and the proposals.

## Title: Limit raised to Rs. 1.5 Mn @ 15% for senior citizen FDs
## Section: Breaking News

Limit raised to Rs. 1.5 Mn @ 15% for senior citizen FDs
	
The Finance Ministry said today it had increased the upper limit to Rs.1.5 million for senior citizens fixed deposits at the interest rate of 15% per annum from March 1.
The previous limit qualifying for this special interest rate at Commercial and licensed Specialized were fixed deposits up to Rs.1 million.
The ministry said in a statement that on the instruction of Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, Treasury Secretary R.H.S. Samaratunga had informed the Central Bank to notify all banks that the previous circular in this regard had been amended.
Full Statement
The present Government, under its 100-day programme, in the Budget - 2015 for the first time introduced a 15% special interest scheme for senior citizens fixed deposits up to one million rupees maintained by senior citizens over the age of 60 years. Accordingly, the Government pays the difference between the 15% and the market standard interest rate offered by commercial banks.
Treasury has incurred Rs.13,000 million for this purpose in 2016. As a result of this offer to senior citizens, the number of fixed deposits by senior citizens rose to 450,000 in 2016 from 91,000 in 2015.
The number of fixed deposits maintained by senior citizens is reported to have risen today to 500,000 since the Minister Ravi Karunanayake announced the continuation of the senior citizens deposits scheme which guarantees an interest of 15 percent for deposits with the increase of the upper limit up to Rs 1.5 million.
Director General of Department of Development Finance said that with the increase of the upper limit, Treasury has to spend Rs.18,000 million to pay the 15% interest during this year.
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that this Government introduced various facilities to assist senior citizens after 2015 as the ageing population is on the increase in the island.
In addition to the 15% interest, which was introduced in the country for the first time in 2015, the benefit of Agrahara Insurance Scheme available for the public servants was extended up to 70 years for the benefit of those who are retiring from the public sector. In the Budget 2017 the Minister Ravi Karunanayake announced the extension of the insurance cover for the full life time of the retiring public servants from this January

Nuclear football photo at Trumps resort puts Pentagon in an awkward position
	

By Dan Lamothe (c) 2017, The Washington Post  
Its unlikely that an Army officer posing for a photograph with a patron at President Donald Trumps Mar-a-Lago golf resort while apparently carrying the nuclear football broke any Defence Department regulations, Defence officials said, but doing so has put the Pentagon in an awkward situation. 
The image was one of several posted over the weekend by Richard DeAgazio, a retired investor, as the president took phone calls publicly over dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe after North Korea conducted a ballistic missile test Saturday night. The photographs have prompted questions among some national security professionals because it appears Trump and his staff handled a sensitive - and potentially classified - security situation in public. 
One of the images shows the officer - identified by DeAgazio as Rick the Man - smiling and putting his arm around the retired investor for a photograph. The officer wears an ornamental braided cord known as an aiguillette that, when worn on the right shoulder, denotes status as an aide-de-camp to the president or first family. 
Defence officials declined Monday afternoon to discuss the photos on the record. Speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, they described reaction to the incident as exaggerated. The White House, which typically employs a handful of officers as aides-de-camp for the president, did not respond to requests for comment. The football is actually a leather briefcase known formally as the Presidential Emergency Satchel. It carries material needed to launch a nuclear weapon in the event of an emergency. Numerous news photographs show officers wearing name tags while carrying the satchel, including recently with Trump and last year with former President Barack Obama. Analysts familiar with nuclear policy said it was unusual for an aide to agree to be photographed with a civilian, although it was not clear he knew the image would be circulated on social media. Stephen Schwartz, the author of Atomic Audit: The Cost and Consequences of Nuclear Weapons Since 1940, tweeted Monday that he isnt outraged by the photo with the aide - its just tacky and inappropriate DeAgazio boasted about it on Facebook.

Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert at the East Asia Nonproliferation Programme at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, California, agreed with Schwartz but noted sarcastically that posing for a photo with DeAgazio was innovative.  Tom Nichols, a professor at the Naval War College and a nuclear policy scholar, said on Twitter that critics are overreacting. He said holding the meeting about the North Korean missile launch in public is a far more worrisome point.

PCs will take over powers to approve physical plans: Isuru Devapriya
	
Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said yesterday that the Chief Ministers of all nine provinces had agreed to pass a resolution enabling provincial councils to be the sole decision making bodies with regard to approving physical plans.
The chief minister said the decision making on physical planning was thus far mutually conducted by the respective provincial councils and the Urban Development Authority (UDA).
However, the UDA is planning to take away the decision making right of our councils so that they could make decisions on their own. We will adopt resolutions in our councils empowering the provincial councils to make decisions on physical planning, he said at a media briefing.
He said neither a Ministry nor the UDA had authority to take away the powers of the provincial councils.
Clearly someone has deceived the UDA chairman. The income generated by this subject has already been added to the budget. That is also a matter of serious concern. The UDA has many ways of getting income unlike Provincial Councils, he said.
We have been given the power to enact such resolutions by the Constitution. Many Provincial Councils, including the Western and Northern councils, have protested against the UDA action. There is no legal barrier to adopt a resolution in this regard. Therefore, we will adopt this as soon as possible and before the end of the tenure of the current Provincial Councils, he said.
He said that they could reverse the UDA decision through this resolution. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Perpetual Treasuries files writ petition against Monetary Board
	
Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd, a primary dealer specialising in the intermediary government security market, filed a Writ Petition before the Court of Appeal seeking an order quashing the directions of the Monetary Board imposing restriction on it.
It claims that, in the absence of a formal violation of procedure by it in the purported bond scandal, the true intentions behind the issuing of the said directions are mala fide, and ultra vires the regulatory powers of the Respondents.
It bemoans that the impugned directions were issued for extraneous reasons in order to satisfy the media and political agendas.

In the petition filed through Attorney-at-Law G.G.Arulparagasam, the Petitioners, Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd, Perpetual Asset Management (Pvt) Ltd and Perpetual Capital Holdings (Pvt) Ltd cited the Central Bank, the Monetary Board and 11 others as Respondents.
The matter is to be taken up before Court on February 20.
Some of the directions are that (1) Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd shall not bid at any primary auctions exceeding 12.5% of the total amount offered at such auction and shall not bid exceeding 20% of the offered amount of each item representing different maturities; (2) the daily aggregate of the secondary market transactions by it in government securities shall not exceed Rs 1 billion; (3) It shall not, except with the prior written approval of the Monetary Board, distribute its profits, retained earnings or reserves; (4) It shall not enter into any transaction, for consideration or otherwise, except with the prior written approval of the Monetary Board, in respect of anything not connected with the activities of a primary dealer.

After briefly exchanging niceties, the duo discussed the latest political developments as well. The firebrand member, after explaining his take on certain topical issues, suddenly fired this question at Number One: Sir, why on earth did you assign this key portfolio to that gon-batalaya (a derogatory term usually used to describe a big-made dim-witted person) Man has now become a big curse!

SAITM: IUSF to launch countrywide protest from today
	
The Inter University Student's Federation (IUSF) said yesterday the six months' suspension on admitting students to SAITM would not make any difference and vowed to launch a countrywide protest campaign from today.
IUSF Convener Lahiru Weerasekara told a media briefing that they could not agree with the proposal made by the Deans of the eight State Medical Faculties and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella to suspend admissions to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) until the completion of the periodic review of its medical degree programme.
The suspension will not make any difference because SAITM does not enrolling students on a monthly basis. Admissions usually take place once or twice a year and this year's enrollments may have been completed by now, he said.
Mr. Weerasekara said the government was attempting to fool the Deans while supporting SAITM Chairman Neville Fernando to continue with his activities to privatise education.
He said the graduates were expected undergo clinical training in a state hospital and pass a licensing examination conducted by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
We oppose these proposals and will not let up in our struggle to safeguard free education. SAITM should be abolished immediately. Our fight is not against standards but against the privatisation of free education, Mr. Weerasekara said and added that today's protest campaign would be launched from Kandy, Galle, Ratnapura, Anuradhapura and Kuliyapitiya.

Six Lankans sentenced to 5 years in jail in Dubai
	
Six Sri Lankan men, who formed a gang that targeted villas and rob jewelry and valuables and cash, were each sentenced to five years in jail in Dubai.
The six men, aged between 26 and 40, were found guilty by the Court of First Instance of robbery at night with the use of sharp tools, damage of private property and trespass.
The six accused, including five unemployed and a driver, damaged a safe in the complainant's villa in addition to four bedroom doors.
The court ordered that the six be deported after serving their jail terms.
The present case dates back December 11, 2015, and was registered with Al Barsha police.
A police lieutenant said he was part of the police task force that arrested four of the accused as they were about to flee the country through the Dubai International Airport.
"We received reliable information that the defendants were involved in several robbery incidents. After we apprehended them and seized their luggage we realized they could only speak their own language. We took them to the CID where we interrogated them with the help of an interpreter. We searched their baggage in front of them and found a large quantity of jewelry and valuables hidden in date boxes," the lieutenant told the prosecutor.
"They admitted they had stolen from various houses across Dubai. They said they followed instructions from the first accused. They used to drop leaflets on residential villas doors and come back two days later to see whether they were removed. That was how they would make sure the residents were away".
The accused led the police to the villas they had targeted. Their plan was to smuggle the stolen jewelry out of the UAE and then split it among each other.
Another police sergeant said one of the gang was arrested in Sharjah. "He was referred to Dubai police after he admitted that he targeted and robbed together with others villas in Dubai," the officer said.
Sharp tools used in the break-in and robbery were seized from the place of one of the defendants.
The accused may appeal the ruling within 15 days.

Three Blues set to ride elephant back
	

A rumour that several Betel leaf stalwarts were poised to pole-vault to the Green party spread like wild fire in the past few days.

Three names were mentioned in this connection. All are top team members. Having done some homework, the trio had reportedly concluded that the chances of winning back their seats on the Betel leaf ticket at the coming polls were very remote and the best available bet was to ride elephant back.
The two of the trio set for the jump are from Uva; one is a very senior Blue and the other is the one who publicly disowned Appochchi. The third one is a reticent character from Wayamba who once held a high post in the Blue party.
In a move to clear the coast for the Blue senior from Uva poised for the jump, a young dashing Green one from Colombo who is currently based in the main district in Uva on the strength of his matrimonial ties, has decided to shift his political activity to the Gampaha district, they say.
Although, the nekata for the proposed crossover is yet to be fixed, the trio has already confided in their near and dear ones about the impending move.

Vallibel Finance December profit up 32%; loans & leases moderate
	
Vallibel Finance PLC, a Dhammika Perera-controlled licensed finance company, reported earnings of Rs.4.39 per share for the October-December quarter against Rs.3.34 a share reported during the same period last year, the interim report showed. 
The net profit was Rs.182.8 million, an increase of 31.7 percent from a year ago, as the loans grew albeit at a modest pace. The net interest income rose by 18.4 percent to Rs.510 million on year.
The net fee and commission incomes grew by 36.3 percent on year to Rs.22.7 million.
Vallibel mainly thrives on high margin loans and leases granted largely to two-wheelers and three-wheelers and personal loans.
But the pace of growth of such loans slowed down lately due to higher interest rates and loan-to-value ratios imposed on vehicles.
In January 2017, the Central Bank further tightened the credit flows into two-wheelers, three-wheelers and motor cars for personal use, a move that could somewhat limit the future performance of the company. 
During the nine months ended December 31, 2016, Vallibel gave around Rs.5.3 billion loans and leases, an expansion of 29 percent. The total loans and advances reached Rs.23.8 billion. The deposits grew by Rs.2.6 billion or 17.5 percent during the nine months to Rs.17.4 billion. 
Meanwhile, for the nine-month period, the company reported earnings of Rs.12.18 against Rs.8.40 a share a year ago. The net profit for the period was Rs.506.3 million, an increase of 45 percent from a year ago.
The annualized return on equity of the company was as high as 31.31 percent. 
The company said its gross non-performing loans declined to 3.15 percent.
As of December 31, 2016, Vallibel had an asset base of Rs.29.6 billion, up 30.1 percent during the nine months.
As of December 31, 2016, the billionaire businessman, Dhammika Perera along with his investment company collectively held a 76.141 percent stake in Vallibel Finance.

They also proposed that the SAITM students would have to pass a licensing examination conducted by the SLMC.

## Title: Wigneswaran is  not helping the Tamil cause

Wigneswaran is  not helping the Tamil cause
	
 So far as the government is concerned, there is only one holy book, which is the Constitution of India. My government will not tolerate or accept any discrimination based on caste, creed and religion. 
~Narendra Modi 
Indian Express on February 10, 2017 reported thus: The Chief Minister of the Tamil-majority Northern Province of Sri Lanka, C.V. Wigneswaran, has admitted that some unfortunate incidents of the past had inflicted wounds on the Muslims which are yet to heal. He said this while addressing the Ezhuga Tamil (Arise Tamil) rally at Batticaloa in the Eastern Province on Friday. 
The same report says: Batticaloa town and district have a substantial Muslim population. One may remember that it was in a mosque in Kattankudy in the Batticaloa District on August 3, 1990, that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) butchered 143 Muslims while they were set in prayer. Later the same year, the LTTE banished nearly one hundred thousand Muslims from the Northern Province with merely one days notification. 
These two incidents had the same effect that was created in the minds and hearts of Sinhalese Buddhists when nearly forty Buddhist monks, most of whom were Saamaneras (novice monks), were slaughtered on June 2, 1987 in Arantalawa in the Ampara District of Eastern Province. 
Wigneswaran has not deviated from the fundamental premise of all Tamil leaders since the demise of the Ponnambalam brothers, Ramanathan and Arunachalam. Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan and Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam were clearly and most prominently identified with the national agenda of the country. Although the Ponnambalam brothers were very much involved in Tamil politics at the time, their national recognition and overall stature was not second to any leading Sinhalese leader of the time. Their pedigree was impeccable; their education was matchless and their social standing immaculate. Hobnobbing with both the Colonial rulers and the Sinhalese, Muslim and Burger elites at the time, the opinion of the Ponnambalam brothers were frequently sought and regularly rendered. 

The Sinhalese leadership had to depend on Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan for an eloquent and forceful advocacy of the innocence of the then Sinhalese leaders, D.S. Senanayake and F.R. Senanayake and others who were accused of involvement in the Muslim riots in 1915. The speech Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan made in the Legislative Council remains one of the best ever made in the well of the House of our legislative bodies. 
As a matter of fact, caste dimensions were more protruding than those of race and faith. It was most unambiguously illustrated when the election of educated Ceylonese came about in 1911. According to the biography of J.R. Jayewardene of Sri Lanka, written by Professor K.M. de Silva, most of the prominent Sinhalese leaders at the time such as D.S. Senanayake and Justice E.W. Jayewardene KC (J.R.s father) persuaded Sir Ponnambalam who had retired from all public life to stand for election. The prime concern of the Ceylonese national leaders was caste and these so-called leaders of the Sinhalese masses were pressed to do this when Dr. Marcus Fernando, an eminent medical doctor who happened to be married to the daughter of Sir Charles de Soysa, the wealthiest Ceylonese of the second half of the nineteenth century, tendered his nomination. The disqualification in terms of the then Sinhalese leaders was caste. Sir Marcus belonged to Karava caste, considered to be lower than Govigama from which most of the Sinhalese leaders claimed to have hailed.
Ponnambalam Ramanathan (later Sir) was elected with 1,645 votes with Dr. H. Marcus Fernando, receiving 981 votes. The Sinhalese leaders at the time chose caste over race and a great number of Sinhalese voters too opted to vote for a Tamil rather than an established personality from amongst the Sinhalese elite. 
One must realize one dominant element when negotiating with political, ethnic or whatever opponent. A personal relationship between the parties that negotiate would go a long way, a very long way indeed. The relationships between the Sinhalese and Tamil leaderships were not ideal or optimal at that time in the early years of the twentieth century, yet much stronger than now. Defection of Arunachalam, Ramanathans brother, scattered the seeds of disharmony and distrust, seeds of lack of genuine and sincere trust between the two ethnic groups at the highest level of respective leaderships. The Tamil leadership that assumed national recognition and power thereafter belonged to the other Ponnambalam, G.G. and the Chelvanayagams and Amirthalingams, now Sampanthan and Sumanthiran and Wignesvaran.  `
What Prabhakaran and the LTTE did was to undo all the good work done by his predecessors. Though at no given time Prabhakaran was the acknowledged leader of the Tamil community in Sri Lanka, by sheer force of his guns, suicide bombers and intimidation he was, for more than two decades, the virtual leader and those moderate leaders too accepted his leadership, dreaming of a never-achievable Elam. 
Recently, this writer had the rare privilege of visiting the bank maintained by the LTTE and also the reception hall that was almost adjacent to the bank where Prabhakaran entertained the would-be suicide bombers for their last meal of rice, vegetables and chicken curry. This complex is located in Kilinochchi, Prabhakarans capital city of the dreamland Elam. It was an impressive piece of architecture whose primary feature was simplicity and functionality. But the final defeat of his dreaded murderous army, Prabhakaran brought upon himself and his cause a terrible setback ending with his shameful end. 
With the end of the war, the Tamil community suffered a psychological defeat and it was not limited to the LTTE and its leader. The Rajapaksas and their cohorts made a futile attempt to own the victory despite the fact that it belonged to the exemplary leadership provided to the security forces by General Sarath Fonseka. And after Fonseka decided to contest the Rajapaksa clan at the Presidential Election in 2009, the war hero became a traitor overnight.
The unleashing of thugs and hooligans in saffron as patriotic forces achieved its desired results for a short time but the personal lifestyles and utterly disgusting manner in which these hooligans in saffron (invalidly pretending to be Buddhist Monks) behaved in public totally destroyed them. And the untold damage and mutilation they brought upon the pious members of the Maha Sanga is enormous and might take a long time to erase. 
But the Tamil community and its present leadership manned by Sampanthan and Wigneswaran have to come to terms with reality. They must realize that their involvement and engagement in national issues, which may not necessarily be Tamil-centered, would go a long way in re-establishing the cordiality and honesty between two ethnic groups whose common destiny is invariably intertwined, not only in the present context but also in the last two millennia. 
And it is in that complex context that the Northern Province Chief Ministers utterances look harmful and damaging to a harmonious and peaceful reconciliation between the two communities. While Sampanthan, the leader of the Tamil National Alliance has chosen to tread a more cautious and steady path, Wigneswaran has opted to travel a more belligerent and argumentative road.
Wigneswarans discipline in advocacy and in the Law may have had more than an influential bearing on what he says and does, but at the same time one would expect that his one-time occupancy in the highest seat of the Law, the Supreme Court, should have tempered his intensity and aggressiveness. 
As I have written in my earlier columns, today we are blessed with a President, although a direct product of the Bandaranaike transformation in 1956, whose disposition and general attitude towards the Tamil Question is novel in approach and candid in content. On the other hand, Ranil Wickremesinghe, our Prime Minister too is well disposed towards the Tamil cause and its final determination. Any reconciliation, rhetoric apart, between the two communities dwells in the hazy region of accommodation and compromise. In this regard it is almost criminal not to make use of some of the best brains that Sri Lanka still has. For instance, the likes of Dr. Wickrema Weerasooriya and Jayantha Dhanapala who understand the intricate relationship between negotiation and reality should not be allowed to rot away in the wilderness.
They understand the administrative structures within which a lasting compromise could be reached; they could relate to the Tamil leadership as well as to the international community whose engagement is essential if we are earnest in our pursuit of a just and fair settlement of the numerous issues that have defined and shaped the relationship between the two communities. 
If the present Constitution is not sufficiently providing for a just and fair settlement, if the Thirteenth Amendment is not adequately delivering the legal and administrative wherewithal, then the necessary amendments and further modifications, subject of course to the solicited agreement of the majority Sinhalese and other ethnic groups such as Muslims and Burghers, must be brought in that direction. James Baldwin, African-American Author and Civil Rights Activist, says: It demands great spiritual resilience not to hate the hater whose foot is on your neck, and an even greater miracle of perception and charity not to teach your child to hate.  Such resilience, especially among the Sinhalese majority, needs to manifest itself today.
