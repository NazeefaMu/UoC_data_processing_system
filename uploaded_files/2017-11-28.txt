A JO Govt. will punish bond scam connivers: GL
	
The joint opposition (JO) said today if returned to power, it would appoint a commission with the authority to take action against those involved in the Central Bank bond sales and those attempting to cover them up, under one of its governments.
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman G.L. Peiris said this would be one of the first decisions to be taken by JO government.
?A campaign is being carried out to conceal the real loss caused by the bond scam. Influencing Members of Parliament is also a criminal offence. The perpetrators should be taken to book. The MPs who were contacted by Arjun Aloysius should not hide behind privileges. They have not even informed the COPE Chairman or the Speaker about these conversations,? he said.
Commenting on the upcoming local government election, Prof. Peiris said the SLPP paid deposits for the three districts of Kalutara, Galle and Gampaha on Monday and that deposits for the districts of Colombo, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa will be paid on Tuesday.
He rejected reports about the JO demanding positions to join the SLFP faction in the government.
?Mahinda Rajapaksa was an opposition leader, a prime minister and the president of the country. He doesn?t need posts. This is not about positions but about principles. How can we join the government when we oppose its policies,? he said.
Meanwhile, MP Bandula Gunawardena said the bond scam had a negative impacton four economic indicators with the CB's Weekly Economic Indicators showing an increase in the interest rates in the recent past.
?The interest rate, exchange rate, deposits and investments had been severely affected by the bond scam. For the three years of this government's tenure, the scam had incurred a loss of Rs.1,500 to Rs.2,000 billion. People pawning their valuables, engage in small and medium sector enterprises and constructing a house for themselves, face many difficulties today because of this scam,? he said.
The MP said those engaged in large scale businesses were entertaining thoughts of suicide because of their inability to repay their loans. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

A story of a missing statue
	
?
The chief monk of a temple located in a locality hallowed by the visit of the Enlightened One passed away recently and while the Dayakas were busy making preparations for the cremation a well-known politico had quietly taken away a gold Buddha statue that had been a long standing precious possession of the temple.
?
Once the cremation was over, the Dayakas were shocked to find the gold statue missing and the hurried inquiries made revealed that the politico had taken it away.
They rushed to the politico?s residence and demanded why he took away the precious statue. ?I took it with me to ensure its safety fearing someone would take advantage of the commotion in the place to disappear with the statue,? was the politico?s reply.
The Dayakas told the politico: ?Now that the cremation is over, please bring the statue back to the temple.?
The politico caught with goods readily complied with their request, they say.?

Committee appointed to restructure SriLankan
	
A ministerial committee chaired by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and an official committee headed by Treasury Secretary R.H.S. Samaratunga have been appointed to look into the restructuring of SriLankan airlines, a government source said.
He said the two committees have also been tasked with the selection of a suitable strategic partner and investor to operate the national carrier.
They are expected to submit their reports with recommendations before the end of the year.
The ministerial committee will mainly focus on policy issues and a new management structure to be introduced with the restructuring of SriLankan on the basis of a Public Private Partnership (PPP).
"The main task of the official committee will be to see how to offset the national carrier's debt of US$702 million as no investor wants to partner with it with this liability. We are trying our best to find a way to settle this with local and foreign financial institutions and select the best investors among eight global and regional airlines that have shown interests for such a business model," the source said.
He said SriLankan airlines would not be sold outright to any one and the official committee would consider all options and decide how to revive the airlines and at least turn it into a no profit, no loss venture without being a liability to the Treasury.
?A big question mark hangs over the deals negotiated to purchase six new Airbuses, as the price quoted was much higher than the prevailing market price," the source said.
The original blueprint drawn during the Rajapaksa administration was to purchase 13 aircraft. A 320, A 330 and A 340 air buses were to be delivered by the Air Bus Industries at a list price of US$1.5 billion by 2020 on a staggered basis.
Sri Lanka expects to host 2.5 million tourists by 2020 and the target would not be met if the fleet of aircraft remained obsolete and ground handling inefficient. Therefore, in addition to purchasing new aircraft, the Civil Aviation Ministry has already taken steps to build another terminal adjoining the existing one at the Bandaranaike International Airport.

Country needs rulers with backbones: CBK
	
While claiming that there should be a philosophy for the rulers to develop the country in addition to a clear proramme to implement it, former President Chandrika Kumaratunga on Sunday said 'there should be leaders who should have a backbone to implement the programmes at a time when the challenges exist in the society.'
Addressing an event in Veyangoda the former President also said: There should be a philosophy for the rulers to develop the country. That philosophy is not for my benefits, nor for filling the pockets of myself and my siblings. Our philosophy should be a programme that helps us to develop the country. We should have a clear programme to implement it. It is not only philosophy that is required but the programme to implement it. There should be leaders who should have backbones to implement the programmes at a time when the challenges exist in the society like this. We want not only one leader but also the officers in the hierarchy from the Cabinet of Ministers to Pradeshiya Sabhas. They should think in terms of the welfare and the development of the country."
She also said that some are saying to handover the country to them just because of winning the war. "But three fourth of the war was won by me and my Government. See the indecent stories fabricated in this regard. Why can?t we develop the country? The crux of the question lies there. The whole treasury had become empty. They have robbed the country and now they have begun to corrupt the country.?

Foreign reports of SL storm threat not true: Met
	
The Meteorology Department of Sri Lanka yesterday advised the people not to panic over foreign reports forecasting a storm or flood threats in the country.
Met Department Director Forecaster Anusha Warnasooriya told the Daily Mirror the people have begun to panic due to several foreign news reports of a storm that would likely hit Sri Lanka followed by a flood threat, however so far the Meteorology department data doesn?t have evidence to confirm such reports.
She said the Meteorology Department was observing a low level atmospheric disturbance in the Bay of Bengal however it would travel over Sri Lanka towards India.
Further she said different regions of the world are using various numerical models to collect data and forecast on the weather but all those models are not suitable for Sri Lanka therefore most foreign reports are not reliable.
She also said the build up of a storm could be identified early and the Met Department would know if there was such a threat..
A major storm hit the country last in 2000.
Meanwhile, the Met Department said that rainfall exceeding 75 mm could be expected during the next 36 hours in some places particularly in the Central, Eastern, Uva, Southern and Sabaragamuwa provinces.
It also said Misty conditions could be expected at some places in the Western, Sabaragamuwa and Central provinces during the mornings with winds over 50 kmph. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

HOPE FROM THROW-AWAY SOAP
	
Manrosa- Home of love sets and example
?
Your Editorial of Saturday November 4 was very timely, relevant and revealing. People crave for exciting news and the media are quick to respond with juicy news about war, violence, murder, rape, sex, corruption, financial scams etc so much so that, as you rightly point out, our society has become depressed and frustrated and peoples? lives have been shrouded with despair and depression.??
It is only occasionally that we read or hear some positive story and of course there are far more positive and heart-rending stories than our media are willing to publish. We should be hearing more and more episodes like that of the Cambodian student Samit Lakhani who started the Eco-Soap Bank or that of Mona Patel, the young Californian teenager who formed the San Antonio Amputee Foundation.??
While we have many positive social projects here in Sri Lanka we hardly hear of such things in our daily newspapers or television broadcasts. Today I would like to highlight the work of one social project which is an Elders Home in the remote village of Dunimalakotuwa in the Chilaw district. It is being run under the name Manrosa Home of Love by a private family.??
?
?
Manrosa Home commenced 18 years ago with just about four inmates. The first was a Tamil Hindu lady from Kurunegala. The second was a Buddhist lady from the village and the others were Christians in the neighbourhood all above 65 years old. Since then many more have joined and of them 9 inmates have already passed away. Well over 60 inmates have passed through the Home since its inception
?
Manrosa Home commenced 18 years ago with just about four inmates. The first was a Tamil Hindu lady from Kurunegala. The second was a Buddhist lady from the village and the others were Christians in the neighbourhood all above 65 years old. Since then many more have joined and of them 9 inmates have already passed away. Well over 60 inmates have passed through the Home since its inception. At the time it ran as a completely free Home for destitute elders funded by the founder family. As time passed the Home developed into a larger unit housing 20 inmates and the family found it hard to finance the project further on their own financial strength. They sought outside assistance which finally did come from a few friends and from some relatives of the elderly inmates while 50% of the inmates still enjoyed free home care as before.??
Like any other Elders Home, Manrosa too had its ups and downs over the years. Today it has stabilized under the able management and guidance of its Resident Administrator whom we shall call Rita. Rita joined the Home six years back when it was struggling to keep itself above water. Through her diligent and appropriate management techniques she managed to raise the Home to the highest standards possible. She has worked in foreign countries as a domestic nurse for many years and qualified as an ayurvedic physiotherapist and counselor back at home. Such experience is used to give all her inmates in-house treatment for all their ailments including body pain, backache etc and extends also to dietary control of diabetic patients and many more. Often in the evening before bedtime you will see many old ladies queuing up for their share of physiotherapy.??
Caring for elders is not the only item on Rita?s programme. She also has the younger generation close to her heart. This prompts me to relate a most wonderful relationship she has developed with the village schoolchildren. The village school has no teacher to train the children in Mathematics. This went on for more than two years and children were unable to qualify in O-level maths. Rita was able to solve the problem. With permission from the school Principal, she collected all O-level children and also children from pre-O-level class, all 40 of them, to be coached in Maths at Manrosa Home with the help of a retired Maths Teacher who??
volunteered to help free of charge. Last year 18 out of 20 children got through their Maths O - level exam. It was an overwhelming surprise to everyone in school and outside. Rita now has established a permanent classroom in the Home where she not only has arranged for free tuition but also looks into the needs of the more needy children such as their food and other sundry requirements.??
?
?
Rita is a tireless woman. She organizes the cooking, cleans the home, cleans the toilets and maintains a beautiful and large garden She does the marketing and keeps daily accounts by herself
That?s not all. She has added a mini-orphanage also in the Home. Of course this is a temporary arrangement due to rules and regulations where children are concerned. With the consent and supervision of the Probation officers and the local Police she has taken upon herself the responsibility to care for certain young children who have been entrusted to the care of the Probation Department. This is very commendable and we hope that the authorities will lend their cooperation in this most responsible task.??
Rita is a tireless woman. She organizes the cooking, cleans the home, cleans the toilets and maintains a beautiful and large garden. She does the marketing and keeps daily accounts by herself. In order to keep the expenses low, she has even started to keep poultry and presently counts over 100 birds. ?At least I don?t have to buy eggs anymore,? she says.??
That is a positive story about Manrosa Home. I do hope that Providence will support Rita to continue her good work for many years to come.??
Well-wisher.? ?

?

New Zealand facing 9.0 magnitude devastating earthquake
	
New Zealand, (Daily Mail), 27 November 2017 -? New Zealand could be hit by devastating earthquakes and tsunamis after the awakening of a long-dormant fault, scientists warn.??
Geologists claim the dangerous Hikurangi subduction zone has begun to move following the devastating Kaikoura earthquake in 2016, which claimed the lives of two people.? They state the trench - running offshore from the top of the South Island to Gisborne in the north - can produce deadly 9.0 earthquakes and tsunamis powerful enough to reach residents in just seven minutes.? ?We need to think Japan 2011 basically, because if our whole plate boundary ruptured it would be a magnitude-9 earthquake,? GNS scientist Ursula Cochran told Fairfax.??
The intense earthquakes are caused when the tectonic plates along the boundary are forced over the top of one another, creating ?megathrust?.??
Previous earthquakes along such zones include the catastrophic 9.1 event in Sumatra, resulting in the Boxing Day tsunami that claimed the lives of around 250,000 people.??

Pope faces high-wire act as he lands in Myanmar
	
?
Pope Francis flew to Myanmar on Monday in one of his most sensitive trips yet, as religious tensions fester in the mainly Buddhist nation that has bristled at global outrage over its treatment of Rohingya Muslims.?
?
Myanmar?s military is accused of waging an ethnic cleansing campaign against the stateless Muslim minority, more than 600,000 of whom have fled a crackdown in northern Rakhine State for neighbouring Bangladesh over the past three months.? ?
The Pope has been forthright about his sympathy for the Rohingya from afar, calling them ?brothers and sisters? and deploring the plight of hundreds of thousands of children swept up in the violence.? ?
Francis will meet powerful army chief Min Aung Hlaing and civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi during the trip in a highly anticipated encounter between a religious leader who has championed the rights of refugees and the man accused of overseeing the charge to drive out the Rohingya.? ?
But the country is holding its breath over what the pontiff will say on Myanmar soil, where any mention of the word Rohingya could unleash anger from a public that broadly supports the army campaign.? ?
Many in the Buddhist-majority nation do not view the minority as indigenous -- referring to them as ?Bengalis? -- and view them with hostility.? ?

However, it was again the State Enineering Corporation who undertook this construction, taking care not to disturb the foundation of either the new building or the old building. In the recent period the present Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela had it renovated with gold strips. But, it needed a repair and the custodians had to call on the President for this purpose.? ?
President Maithripala Sirisena magnanimously gave an outright donation for this purpose and now the work is being carried out.? ?

70th Human Rights Day  Walk in Colombo
	
The International Human Rights Day will be celebrated this year under the theme ?The White Night Walk?. Celebrations will be hosted by the Road to Rights Youth Organization on December 10.? The organisation is celebrating the event for the 5th consecutive year.
The walk will begin from Independence Square and participants will then move to Premakirthi de Alwis Mawatha. The walk will commence at 5 p.m. The organisers take this opportunity to invite all those interested in this national cause.??
The walk will commence with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena who will be accompanied by ministers and several social advocates. All of them are joining hands to send the message across to the island nation as to how important human rights are.??

70th year
This year marks the 70th International Human Rights Day. Thus this will be a wonderful opportunity to reflect on how human rights has been protected worldwide. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was established in 1948. Ever since it has acted as a guideline to protect humanity and uphold human dignity, which form the foundation for ensuring human rights.??
Each one of us has instilled a sense of pride and dignity within us and that is human nature. The established regulations of human rights ensures that your dignity is upheld during any situation whether it is; family, school, work place, hospitals and even the bus stop. Thereupon we can come across 30 situations when people are entitled to their human rights, all because they?re human. The humanity within us demands the need to protect each one of us.??
This pops the question ?where is Sri Lanka placed on the road to human rights? Are our children treated humanely enough? Are our women protected? Are our labour rights protected? Do you earn a satisfying salary for your services? These questions will be best answered by the rising annual rape rate in our country which is 6.75%. Other points that can help answer this question are the vast unemployment and never-ending plea for favourable wages. Just consider the protests made and the petitions that grieved parties have forwarded.? ?
?
?
?
No one is alone?
Still, in such a world of technology and development, people?s minds are narrow enough not to understand the fragility of children and the social responsibility they have towards protecting them. Child abuse not only takes place in the form of violence, they are abused verbally and mentally too. We tend to neglect our children and run to our workplaces.?
We neglect our children, our wives, our husbands, our siblings, our parents and our friends. If we stop a minute to understand the difficulties they experience and build up a communication network, no one will have to face their fears alone.? ?
It?s time people come together and educate themselves and the youth about the basics of human rights. These rights were set forth by the United Nations in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The purpose of the ?walk? is to unite people and make human rights a reality. Through education we can end a war, discrimination and intolerance. Yet 69 years on, children aren?t educated about human rights at school.? Youth and adults still aren?t aware of basic Human Rights. The walk for Human Rights is an awareness program and the largest to be held, in connection with this day, in Sri Lanka.??
?
We neglect our children, our wives, our husbands, our siblings, our parents and our friends. If we stop a minute to understand the difficulties they experience and build up a communication network, no one will have to face their fears alone
?
Join hands with us in creating a network of support and care. Be present at independence Square on this day by 4.00 pm clad in white to create awareness and celebrate humanity.??

Three poems and a life
	
Malinda Seneviratne?
?
?
Easily one of the most discernible occurences in the last 20 years within our local English literary sphere has been the ascent of Malinda Seneviratne. Before I get to Malinda the poet, whom I am acquainted with only barely, I need to get to Malinda the man, whom I know personally. There are clear connections between the two, so much so that I can?t separate the one from the other. To understand the reasons behind his rise and ascent, I think it best that we go through his biography before delving into his poetry.??
Malinda Channa Pieris Seneviratne was born on September 23, 1965 in Colombo to Gamini Seneviratne, a Civil Servant and a poet on his own right who would eventually retire as the Chairman of the Coconut Development Authority, and Indrani Seneviratne, who taught English Literature and Greek and Roman Civilization in various schools, her longest tenure being at Royal College, Colombo. Both of them? ?
were English honours graduates from the University of Peradeniya. Malinda was the second in his family, with an elder brother, Arjuna, and a younger sister, Ruwani. They were all born to a culture of connoisseurship and appreciation of the arts. Malinda?s later forays into literature were consequently initiated by his parents, especially his father, who had got him to write a poem when he was 12 years old revolving around a tune played on the family piano.??
University entrance?
He attended Royal College, where he dabbled in Literature and Chess among other activities. Having won all major awards for English literature, he wound up as Prefect and Chess Team Captain, winning the National Championship in 1983. That year he sat for his A Levels, where he offered Mathematics and obtained adequate results to enter the University of Peradeniya. However, he opted to sit for his A Levels in the Arts Stream the following year, where again he secured good enough results to enter University. He entered Peradeniya in 1985 for a Bachelor?s Degree in Sociology.??
Owing to his exceptional academic performance in his first year, Malinda was selected to an exchange program at Carleton College, Minnesota for a Trimester. During the infamous UNP-JVP bheeshanaya of the eighties Universities were shut down in Sri Lanka. After sitting for both TOEFL and SAT, Malinda got a scholarship to Harvard University in December 1988. As with Peradeniya, he studied Sociology, returning to Sri Lanka two and a half years later towards the end of the bheeshanaya.? ?
Following various stints at politics and teaching, including one as an ELT Teacher at the Medical Faculty of Peradeniya University in 1992, he was hired as an Editor at the Agrarian Research and Training Institute in March 1993 before leaving it the following year. He then resumed his higher studies, when upon a friend?s advice he applied to the University of California?s School of Urban and Regional Planning, got in, applied a year later to Cornell University, and managed to read for a PhD in Development Sociology there. However he never completed his PhD: having left his thesis (titled ?Journeying with Honour: In Search of the Vague and Indeterminate?) halfway through, he was instead given a conditional Master?s Degree. As of today, he has not completed it.??
?Edges?
His first collection of poetry, ?Epistles: 1984-1996?, was published in 1999. He submitted his poetry, in manuscript form, for the Gratiaen Award on six occasions between 2007 and 2013. Five of these collections were shortlisted: Threads? in 2007, ?The Underside of Silence? in 2008, ?Some texts are made of leaves? in 2011, ?Open Words are for Love Letting? in 2012, and ?Edges? in 2013, while ?Stray Kites on Stringless Days? didn?t make it to the shortlist in 2010. He won the Gratiaen for ?Edges?, his best anthology by far. Two years earlier, in 2011, he had won the H. A. I. Goonetilaka Award (also with the Gratiaen Trust) for his translation of Simon Navagattegama?s acclaimed Sinhala novel Sansaranyaye Dadayakkara, which he first read at Cornell University and translated, in part, for a class exercise on Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud.??
I would hazard a guess here and contend that of his literary influences, outside his immediate family that is, Neruda and Navagattegama take a prominent place. Malinda?s interest in Neruda ? his subtle, effortless use of imagery in verbal terms ? is there in his best poetry, and to me that is what characterises his prose as well. In Neruda you don?t see the technical gimmicks that are so nakedly apparent in, say, e.e. cummings or Ogden Nash; you see instead the displacement of myth and conjecture and convenient fictions (whether conceived on the personal sphere or through officialdom) through the use of understatement. There is never a rift between the personal and the social. They get together in ways that one essay, let alone one sketchy article, can?t do justice to.??
Malinda is at his most characteristic, and I?d like to think his most enduring, when he abandons the social for the personal and embraces the kind of life he has grown up on and grown up to love. His poems on his daughters, for instance, merit particular scrutiny:??
I?ve held you both??
together and separately??
in wakeful hours and while asleep??
Critics?
The cutting of a whole sentence into a set of lines is characteristic of Neruda and Latin American poetry in general, but it?s interesting to note that Malinda, unlike most young poets here who are entranced by Neruda (not unlike their descendants who were entranced by what they erroneously felt to be the essence of Rabindranath Tagore?s work), doesn?t confuse technical gimmickry for mastery of language.??
But there?s one issue that bothers me. Critics, in their attempt to get at the man, tend to fault him for resorting to religious imagery in his poems. Some of them have faulted him in front of me. Their argument is as follows: for a poet to be truly universal, he or she must transcend his or her affiliations to a particular collective. In the case of Malinda their allegation is rooted in what they feel to be his desire to belong, his exhilaration at being at one with a faith and an ethnicity. I would like to examine two of his poems in this respect, because I know for a fact that the yardstick those critics use is a largely mythical image of an artist as a transcendentalist. (They don?t even want him to affirm humanity; they are content in making him reject his ethno-religious garb.)??
The first poem is disarmingly simple: ?To a little boy holding (onto) a Buddhist flag over his head.? In 24 lines he draws a link between the flag and the collective it represents. While superficially easy, his attitude towards his own faith comes out strikingly in the last line: ?It [the flag] is for holding and breaking son.? The flag is a symbol, at most a quasi-secular symbol. What transcends it is the faith it inhabits and embodies.??
Politics?
Malinda?s politics has reflected his poetry to a lesser extent than his prose. It?s interesting to note that, not unlike his political essays, he is content in dichotomising between the secular and the mythical whilst remaining respectful of the latter. It?s no coincidence that he refuses to indulge in his faith so much in The Underside of Silence, which is chock-a-block with idealisations of his family and his country. He becomes more confident of indulging in faith and ethnic identity, however, in Open Words are for Love Letting (from which the above poem is taken), and even more so in Edges.??
In ?Dhamma? he goes a step further: he enters his faith without merely gazing at it.??
... words can be clap??
and can be clasp??
some are lit??
and others light??
this Vesak??
and always.??
Again you see a dichotomy, between clap and clasp, between lit and light, congealing to this Vesak and all time. It now seems as though polar opposites are reconcilable through his faith. There is a transcendentalism here that one comes across very rarely in his other poems. It?s almost a new sensibility, but is it enough to counter what his critics are saying? The answer to that question lies in another poem: ?Temples?, also included in Edges and manifestly more lengthy, and exploratory, than the above two.??
... their altars crumble??
for want of flowery word??
and clasped hands??
in those timeless??
rituals of evermore love??
grass peeps from stone-edge??
listening for footfall??
that tripped on word-edge?
?
In that first poem I mentioned, Malinda differentiates between the flag and the collective: the latter in effect overwhelms the former. In the second, ?Dhamma?, he draws a dichotomy between the mundane and the supra-mundane that faith trivialises. He has grown more vociferous here: the altars he refers to (which can be from any place of worship, by the way) thrive on an attitude of devotion among their patrons. Patronage, in other words, is constructive, if not essential, to a faith and a collective. He has let go of any transcendentalist tendencies, and embraced a more frank and sincere conception of the relationship between the laity and the clergy. What can we say to his critics, then???
That they are correct in their observation, but wrong in their remedy. Poets are not uprooted secularists. They do not abandon their religious fervour, and some of the best poets one can name derived their themes from their faith. The myth of a transcendentalist poet can be shattered when considering that transcendentalism was in effect an offshoot of Orientalism, or the belief that the two main world systems ? the West and the East ? would come together through universalised conceptions of the faiths adhered to in the latter (Buddhism, Taoism, the Upanishads). It evolved from the essays of Thoreau and had its finest hour in the poetry of Whitman. The humanism in their works was largely derivative and decorative, which means that they had to give way once they moved on to the 20th century. To consider that humanism a sign of a poet?s ability to abandon faith and collective is erroneous, because they were informed less by the secular than by the supra-mundane. Malinda is no transcendentalist, but nor is he the obsessive religious devotee he is touted as, by those who happen to take issue with his politics.??

Two men drown infant after rape attempt fails
	
In another tragic incident that signifies how atrocious humans can be, two men who attempted to sexually abuse a young woman in Kataragama had drowned her little infant in a barrel of water after they failed to fulfil their vicious mission.
Police said two men had entered the house of the 19-year-old woman under the guise of meeting her father-in-law who was away at the time. Her husband had also gone to the temple when the two men arrived around 7 pm on Sunday. They had attempted to sexually abuse her with one man grabbing the 2 month old infant from her mother, while the other attempted to abuse her. But she had managed to free herself from the cluthces of the man and run through the rear door to alert the neighbours. But by then the two had fled in a three wheeler.
However when they were searching for the little infant, they had found it floating on a barrel of water in the compound. The men had allegedly thrown the baby while running away.
The victim was the only daughter of a young couple named Charuka Sunil and Jayani Sandareka (19), residents of Wallimatagama,Menikpuragama in Kataragama.
? My husband is eking out a livelihood by doing odd jobs. At the time of the incident, my husband had gone to the temple. They asked where my uncle was. My uncle is a fish vendor. They told that some money had to be given to him for the fish they bought. They went back as the uncle was no there. They came again at around 7.00 p.m.and forcibly took my child from me. The other suspect tried to rape me. Then I escaped from his grasp and fled out of the back door. When we came back in search of the baby, we found her in a barrel. I can identify the suspects if I see them again,?the child's mother said at the inquest.
The father of the victim, Charuka Sunil said, ? My father is a fish vendor. I am working as a safari driver in Yala. I went out of the house for a certain need, when this incident happened. Jayani had tried to escape from the clutches of the suspects by running out of the scene. After returning with the neighbors, they had found the baby floating in the barrel of water.
?A team of Police officers are investigating with the special supervision of DIG Kithsiri Jayalath in charge of Hambantota and Tangalle Police divisions. (Srinath Prasanna Jayasooriya, M.K.Nandasena)
