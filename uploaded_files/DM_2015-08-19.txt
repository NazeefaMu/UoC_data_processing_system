Election was a research -Sannasgala
	
		 		 
		 
			
The well known tuition master Upul Shantha Sannasgala, who entered the Sri Lankan political arena by contesting the Colombo District from the UNP, but failed to win a parliamentary seat, said yesterday that he considered his contesting the election as an act of research done by him.
He said he could see how people reacted when policy-based politics was adopted by a politician while others were following pledges-based politics.
In my opinion, politicians who practise policy-based politics are rejected by the people. That is what happened to me, he said.
Since beginning his election campaign after selling a plot of land that belonged to him in Kandy, he never gave bribes such as fishing nets, roofing sheets, or sil redi to people in order to get preferential votes, he said.
He said he had conducted an exemplary election campaign and rejected many offers by businessmen to fund his election campaign.
He said he had also not sought any offers from TV channels to promote himself via television debates or discussions, though they would certainly have supported him, since he was a novelist, film producer and lyricist.
However, he said he would not give up his efforts to serve the people through politics despite his defeat.
When asked whether he would agree to it if the UNP offered him a place on its National List, he said he would.
I had to face a similar situation to singer Shihan Mihiranga. Many believed he would be the Super Star in that contest. But unexpectedly he was removed during the competition and Ajith Bandara became the winner. Everybody believed I was certain to be elected to parliament, and consequently voted for others. Now they phone me and say they are sorry I was not elected, he said.(Piyumi Fonseka)

Former State Minister and UNP Colombo district candidate Rosy Senanayake, who failed in her bid for re-election, told Daily Mirror that having to confine her campaign within the Colombo West electorate was one of the reasons to have obtained only 65,320 preferential votes.
She said her fellow candidates were not too happy when she visited other electorates in the Colombo district to carry out her election campaign and as such found it difficult to widen the scope of her campaign.
A UNP victory and to install a UNP-led government was my priority and I expended all my efforts to make it happen and I am overjoyed that it did happen. This is another reason why I was unable to fully focus on my campaign while most of my colleagues were focusing on their personal campaign and ensure their victory above all else. However, my party won and I am really happy about that. I respect the peoples verdict. After all this is what politics means, Ms. Senanayake said.
She said the UNPs election victory was as good as if she herself had won and therefore had no regrets. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Revise the Constitution, electoral system: Cwealth observers
	
Publishing the interim report based on the observations of the general elections 2015, Commonwealth observer group Chairman Dr. George Abela today suggested that the electoral system of Sri Lanka should be put under review and an independent Elections Commission should be established immediately to strengthen the legal and institutional framework for elections.
Previous Commonwealth observer groups had also made the similar observations. As suggested by the new Constitution, an independent Elections Commission should be established as a matter of urgency. Also, a revised and consolidated Constitution is also required to clearly demarcate constitutional powers and duties, especially during election periods, he told a news conference held in Colombo.
The Commonwealth team, which arrived in the country on August 2, met the President, Elections Commissioner, political party representatives and other stakeholders of the election.
It discussed its observations on the election process running up to Mondays election, the voting, counting of votes as well as publishing them on media.
Claiming that the elections were important as the Presidential Election was held only in January, Dr. Abela said the election was remarkably calmer and more peaceful compared to elections held in the recent past.
	The electoral process was credible and met the criteria for democratic elections. Elections Commissioner, the Police and all the stakeholders were able to conclude the entire election process efficiently and transparently. Voters were able to exercise their franchise freely, he said.Pix by Nisal Baduge
