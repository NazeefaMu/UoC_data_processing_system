Belgium VZW backs water projects in Sri Lanka
	

It is common knowledge that one of the never-ending growing problems that this country has had to face is the non-availability of purified drinking water in several districts.
Poor villagers in the dry zone have been the victims of this problem. This unfortunate situation leads to almost fatal conditions like kidney decease.
Sri Lanka Belgium Association (SLBA), a voluntary social service organization, has made attempts to assist the victims in the North Central province. SLBA President Amaradasa Gunawardana has successfully managed to receive financial aid from an organization in Belgium named Adoptie Sri Lanka Belgium VZW.
This Belgium non - governmental organization has been practically involved in social service programs in Sri Lanka during the past three decades. Hence they have gladly consented to assist this social need introduced by SLBA.
The first drinking water project introduced by the SLBA and funded by Adoptie Sri Lanka Belgium VZW was a gift to the remote village called New Mahasen Pura, Welikanda in the Polonnaruwa District. With the view of providing purified drinking water for over 250 families before the dawn of the Sinhala New Year in 2O17, this project was 
declared open on 09th of April 2017. lt has the capacity to produce 10000 liters of purified water a day. We hope that the 116 kidney patients of New Mahasen Pura will not have new additional patients. This Centre of drinking water is managed by Mahasen Death Donation Society (Maranadara Samithiya) in Nawa Mahasen Pura.
The good and encouraging news spread fast. The establishment of the drinking water project in New Mahasen Pura helped bring under the spotlight people in a similarly remote village in
Polonnaruwa District. These people from Kajuwatta requested for similar social assistance.
With the encouraging approval from Adoptie Sri Lanka Belgium VZW the drinking water project in Kajuwatta was declared open on 04th April 2018. This project is expected to provide drinking water to 3500 people in this remote area. They consider it a great fortune that they received this benefit well in advance of the Sinhala New Year of 2018. SAMAGI
Death Donation Society (Maranadara Samithiya) has agreed to manage this project. A coconut plant was gifted to each family on this day.
The third drinking water project in the series was proposed to be constructed in a village named HIDOGAMA in pavakkulama area of Nachchaduwa Divisional region of Anuradapura District. The original request was received from Hidogama Rural Development Society. The officials of SLBA referred this request to Adoptie Sri Lanka
Belgium VZW who promptly approved the project. Over 250 families of this region will be benefited by this drinking water project. We all know that the month of June usually is the period that large numbers of pilgrims from all over the country visit Anuradapura.
Considering this SLBA together with the Hidogama Rural Development Society has arranged to declare open this project on 25th June 2018. This occasion will be graced by Madam Linda Stabel the president of Adoptie Sri Lanka Belgium VZW. She will declare open the project.

British PM does better than expected in UK local elections
	
LONDON AFP May 4, 2018 - British Prime Minister Theresa Mays Conservative party fared better than expected in local elections in England, early results on Friday showed, in her first test since losing her parliamentary majority last year. 
The party held on to key London councils despite a big push by the main opposition Labour party, which admitted its results so far had been mixed. 
The UK Independence Party (UKIP), which has seen its support collapse since the 2016 vote for Brexit, were all but wiped out, while the pro-European Liberal Democrat party made gains. 
Labours leftist leader Jeremy Corbyn had sought to make the vote about national spending cuts, building on a campaign that deprived the government of its majority in parliament in last years general election. 
May had also had a difficult week, with divisions erupting once again in her cabinet over Brexit and the resignation of a top minister last weekend over an immigration scandal.

Debate on Judicature (Amendment) Bill on May 9
	
The debate on the Judicature (Amendment) Bill will be taken up in Parliament on Wednesday, Deputy Chief Government Whip Ajith Perera said yesterday.
He said this at the opening of the new auditorium of the Divisional Secretariat Office in Milleneiya last morning.
We will enact the Judicature (Amendment) Bill which provides provisions to set up a trial-a-bar despite whatever the obstacles that might come our way. The legislation will make the judiciary efficient as the new trial-at-bar will sit daily and hear cases on corruption. The Judiciary in this county is inefficient and the Judicature (Amendment) Bill will takes this inefficiency away, Mr. Perera said.
Commenting on the arrest of the Presidents Chief of Staff by the bribery commission on Thursday, he said this government had created a culture where action was taken even against high level government officials who are corrupt.
Only politicians were known for corruption earlier but the arrest of the Presidents Chief of Staff had clearly shown that even government officials are corrupt, Mr. Perera said.
Corruption in this could be stopped only if the old thieves and the new ones are brought to book. We will penalise the old thieves and the new alike," he added. (Yohan Perera)

Development projects will bear fruit in a few years: PM
	
People will reap the benefits of development in a few years time, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
He said this at the opening of the newly built auditorium at the Milleniya Divisional Secretariat.
Many are asking what this government had done during the past three years. One will begin to feel and reap the benefits of the development work carried out by this government only in few years time, the Prime Minister said. One will be able to see imagined opportunities with the industrial and tourism zones being set up now. You will be able to put up hostels, shops and even one could lend his or her garden space to keep large containers and earn money. If you allow two containers in your garden that will help you to earn a considerable amount of money, the Premier said.
He said the work on the Milleniya Industrial Zone will begin in June this year. He said the final agreement with the Thai company which is going to manage the zone would be signed shortly. The Hambantota Industrial zone is also ready to take off and so is the tourism zone in Deduwa and Iranawila," the Premier said.
He said divisional secretariat offices have a major role to play when it came to development of villages. If the divisional secretariat becomes inefficient all development work will come to a standstill, the Premier said and recalled that the industrial zone project in Biyagama became a success story because of the divisional secretariat carried out its work effectively and efficiently.

Great explorer, doctor ends journey
	

The recent death of Ariyasena U. Gamage was a great loss for not only the medical profession, but also for people who are thinkers, philosophers and explorers. 
One outstanding feature about him was that he was never dogmatic about his views as a Western medicine doctor and was willing to explore other truths of the world. In a recent article penned by Science writer and journalist Nalaka Gunawardene for Sunday Ravaya he says that Dr. Gamage had even seen some positives in wearing pirith nool, a thread blessed by a black magician and often worn by patients. The doctor had said that the pirith nool can help the patient because there were positive human thoughts and wishes to get well embedded in it. 

He even chose to do a study of alternative medicine for his PHD. For this purpose he travelled to countries like India, Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Indonesia and China

He began his career in 1979 as Medical Officer Health (MoH) of Mawanella. He also served as Medical Director Kegalle and even lectured at Peradeniya University. However, later in his medical career, he opened a dispensary in Mawanella and served the public. Its said that the late Dr. Gamage had used kind words when dealing with patients which many vouch had a soothing effect on patients who came for treatment. 
Though he was open to the ideas of others the doctor was also on a mission to squash myth and educate people. For this he used media tools like Youtube, television, newspaper and books. Some of the books that are popular with his readers are Mata Aduma Dan Suwai (Im now cured of my wheeze), Rajek Unath Ledek Unoth (Whats the use of being a doctor whos sick) and Puthgalikai Rahasigathai (Private and confidential). 
He also wrote extensively on rebirth and invested time and energy on pursuing this subject. He was a critic of myths and often condemned the talk about the existence of pills which made females lose the ability to bear children. He also squashed several myths associated with the decease cancer.

Dr. Gamage led a happy life which was full of accomplishments. He bid goodbye to this world on March 29. The funeral of the Dr. Gamage was held at his hometown in Mawanella on April 1.

Research onalternative medicine
Much if his time and energies went in to doing research on alternative medicine. Dr. Gamage affirmed that alternative medicine practised in Sri Lanka could be used for primary cures. He even chose to do a study of alternative medicine for his PHD. For this purpose he travelled to countries like India, Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Indonesia and China. Apart from ayurveda, he also explored the possibility available for curing patients using Sri Lankas very own native treating methods. 
Dr. Gamage also invested time on doing research on rebirth. He was a patient listener when stories were related to him on these lines. But the doctor was never hasty in forming his opinion on these subjects. He didnt hesitate to question myth and never spoke about any such subject without thoroughlyanalysing its content. 
He also wrote extensively using print media and even regularly spoke on the subject sex education. He used media to open a column by the name Wedek unath ledek unoth (Whats the use of being a doctor if you are sick). By this time he was diagnosed with cancer. (Hodgkins Lymphone).


Saradiel Village
Dr. Gamage created time for other activities. Being a doctor consumes most of the hours when a medical practitioner is awake. But he had time to travel and explore. One of his patients Aloysius Perera, a teacher, had once told him about how Uthuwankande Saradiel had hid in the balcony at his residence in Mawanella. This residence is now known as Galle Gedara. Its said that hearing such stories had prompted Dr. Gamage to build Saradiel Village in Uthuwana, Mawanella. He had later said that he had build this village to honour the country and the medical profession. 
An old boy of Richmond College Galle, Dr. Gamage married Dr. Manel Dissanayake, also a product of the same medical college he graduated from. They raised two daughters who also went on to become doctors themselves. According to media reports their offspring also chose doctors as their life partners. 
Its somewhat perplexing for us laymen to fathom that doctors who prescribe medicine for us also fall ill. Dr. Gamage was said to have been in the best of health before being diagnosed with cancer. But the positive nature of this man didnt allow him to succumb to depression despite the cancer within his body spreading rapidly and causingdisruption within. 
Dr. Gamage led a happy life which was full of accomplishments. He bid goodbye to this world on March 29. The funeral of the late Dr. Gamage was held at his hometown in Mawanella on April 1. This candle in the medical profession that blew out, leaves a void for a person who explores, does research and analyses matters that are outside the medical syllabus but are important to people.
His medical colleagues and close associates will vouch that Dr. Gamage was one of the best examples for a person who never removed his thinking cap.

Hawaiis Kilauea volcano spews lava 150ft into the air
	

Hawai, (Daily Mail), 4 May 2018 - Ten thousand Hawaii residents have been ordered to evacuate their homes after the Big Islands Kilauea volcano erupted and began spewing lava and dangerous gases into the air. 
The eruption was accompanied by a 5.0 magnitude earthquake, followed by hundreds of smaller tremors. 
Warning sirens sounded across the Big Island at 4.30pm on Thursday as Hawaii County Civil Defense urged residents of Leilani Estates, in Puna, to flee the approaching lava streams. 
A 492ft fissure opened in the ground with lava flowing from it for around two hours, officials said, with magma a few feet before stopping. Geologists warned the eruption is still ongoing. 
Dangerously high levels of sulfur dioxide have also been detected in the air, which is harmful to humans if breathed in and can cause acid rain after combining with water. 
Lower Puna resident Ikaika Marzo told the Honolulu Star Advertiser that he saw fountains of lava shooting 150 feet in the air and molten lava spreading down Mohala Street in Leilani Estates.

Importing vehicles with euro four standard by July 1- Customs not informed
	
The Sri Lanka Customs said they had not been informed by the government about importing vehicles compatible with the Euro four standards from July 1, Customs Department officials said.
It is a standard that sets a strict limit on the amount of particulate matter such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons that vehicles can emit.
Customs Media Spokesman Deputy Director Sunil Jayaratne said The government was supposed to issue the gazette notification but no information had yet been received by the Customs Import Control Department, he said. Most of the vehicles being imported conform to euro four standards. Vehicle manufacturers know that their products should be compatible with the euro four standards. In fact the vehicles that are being imported from Japan and UK are upto euro six standards, Mr Jayaratne said.
He said, there would be a problem for Indian vehicle importers if this rule comes into operation as their export quality does not meet euro four standards. However, their domestic manufacturers meet euro four standards.
He added that while it was necessary to transform to the euro four standards, there should be a procedure to remove the vehicles in the country which were not upto euro four standard.
Meanwhile, vehicle importers' associations claimed that they would not be able to import vehicles up to euro four standard by July 1 and they required more time for the transition to take place.
The governments decision was to ban the import of vehicles which are not equipped with air bags and seat belts and were below the emission levels or its equivalent as prescribed by Euro four standards.
Accordingly, the import of vehicles which do not include airbags and seat belts for the driver and the front passenger, Anti-Locking Breaking System (ABS) standards and three-point seatbelts at the rear would be prohibited from July 1. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Penny Black celebrates 178 years!
	
Penny Black was the worlds first adhesive postage stamp used in a public postal system. It was issued in Great Britain on 1 May 1840, for official use from 6 May of that year. It features a profile of Queen Victoria. The stamp marks its 178th anniversary on May 6 (Sunday).
In 1837, British postal rates were high, complex and anomalous. To simplify matters, Sir Rowland Hill proposed an adhesive stamp to indicate pre-payment of postage. At the time it was normal for the recipient to pay postage on delivery, charged by the sheet and on the distance travelled. 
The picture in the stamp features Queen Victoria, based on a sketch of her by William Wyon when she visited London in 1837. The Penny Black stamp was only used for one year because the red cancellation mark was hard to spot on its black background. As a result, nine months later, the stamp was reprinted as a red stamp, so that the black cancellation marks were easily visible and harder to remove. 

Cancellation 
A special postmark was also introduced to cancel the stamps. This was popularly known as the Maltese Cross. It was to begin with in black. But since it was difficult to spot a black postmark on a black stamp the color was changed to red. The postal authorities were clearly worried that people might clean the stamp so that it could be used again. The colour of Penny Black was later changed to red for this very reason.

Printing plates 
The stamps were printed on sheets of 240, from engraved steel plates, on gummed paper with a single small crown watermark on each stamp. They were imperforated and had to be cut out
with scissors. 

Corner letters 
The stamps were printed on sheets of 240 (2012) and they had corner letters (bottom left and right of the stamp) corresponding to its position on the plate. Starting with AA, AB, ACto AL for the top row, the second row goes from BA to BL and the twentieth row from TA to TL. Four different alphabets were used in the course of time to form the corner letters. A penny black with the corner letters SG is shown below, as well as its position on the sheet. 

Main factorsaffecting value 
1- The condition grading and centering. An unused or mint stamp is generally worth more than a used one. The number, size, and regularity of the margins make a big difference to the value. The stamps were not perforated, and had to be separated using scissors. As there is only about 1mm between one stamp and another, it is very easy to wander off just a little and cut into the printed design of the stamp. 
2- The plate the stamp was printed from 
3- The overall appearance of the stamp. Any fault such as a thin, tear, crease, or stain will reduce the value

Private sector holidays not in gazette notifications: Vajira
	
The fact that no indication has been given about the public and bank holiday for the private sector on May 7 in lieu of May 1 (May Day) was not a discrepancy but a result of the governments method of issuing gazette notifications, Home Affair Minister Vajira Abeywardena said.
The government officially announced about nullifying the Public and Bank Holiday on May 1, while May 7 has been declared a Public and Bank holiday instead. The change was made following the governments decision to shift the May Day holiday to May 7, he explained.
The Minister further said that only public and bank holidays are issued via government gazette notifications and private sector holidays are not included.
In terms of the powers vested in the Minister of Home Affairs under the Holiday Act No. 29 of 1971, all holidays pertaining to the year 2018 have been published by Gazette Notification No. 2024/55 on Saturday June 24, 2017 which relates only to the government sector and excludes the private sector.
Minister Abeywardana said that a private circular relating to holidays would be issued by the Labour Ministry. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

SF takes swipe at President
	
Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Minister, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said yesterday that former president Chandrika Kumaratunga told him recently with tears in her eyes that she was unable to get an appointment to meet President Maithripala Sirisena for three months and could not contact him over the phone for two months.
He said the President, who agreed to appoint him Law and Order minister, refused to do so later saying that some people including several DIGs and Buddhist monks opposed the move.
When asked why the President who initially agreed to offer the ministry later changed his mind, the minister said it was a long story and explained what happened.
After the Presidential election on January 8, four of us met at the residence of former President Kumaratunge to discuss the future plans of the government. President Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Chandrika Kumaratunge and the person named Sarath Fonseka were present. Then I was the leader of the Democratic Party (DP). Five speakers were arranged to speak at the election rallies for the 2015 presidential election. Champika Ranawaka, Arjuna Ranatunge, Hirunika Premachandra and myself were in the list of speakers. I had opened 65 party officers throughout the country and I addressed 100 election rallies and my wife addressed 30 rallies when I was absent. That is how we contributed to the election. We got into a fight with the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Our whole family worked in the election campaign taking a great risk. But by today, Ex-President Kumaratunge told me recently with full of tears in her eyes that she was unable to get an appointment to meet President Maithripala Sirisena for three months and could not contact him over the phone for two months,
The idea that the Prime Minister should be removed from the post after the local government elections was first brought up by the President. Then the no-confidence motion was brought against the Prime Minister. It was reported that the SLFPers who voted in favour of the motion were the ones who keep close company with the President. The President was of the view that the Prime Minister should be removed. That was what happened to the two of us who were in the discussion. The third was me. The UNP had proposed to the President that I should be appointed as the Law and order Minister. He told me before I was leaving for Indonesia that I would be getting a powerful ministry. Then I left for Indonesia for a family trip. Presidents parliament secretary and Minister Rajitha Senaratne asked me to return to the country saying that I was to receive a powerful ministry. But I refused to return in a hurry. Later I saw in the websites that the Prime Minister has taken over the ministry for two weeks. But when I returned to the country, the Prime Minister informed me that the President was objected the ministry being given to me. Then I met the President and asked why it was so. The President said about five DIGs had asked him not to give me the ministry as I was serving in the army and was unable to hold the post. Then I explained that I had worked with the police when I was in the army and I had even worked with present IGP. I cannot accept the fact the Presidents decision to refuse to give me the post due to the objection of several DIGs,
I asked if the President told the Prime Minister that several Buddhist monks had objected the post given to me. Then he admitted that he told it to the Premier. But he refused to disclose the names of the monks. He also said several government officials also asked him not to give me the ministry as I have difficulty getting Visas to some countries and I would be unable to attend events in abroad. I am not someone who goes abroad on public money. What he should have done was not to refuse me the ministry on that ground but to discuss with such countries and arrange me to get the visas, he explained the matters behind him not getting the Law and Order Ministry and added that it was a sad reflection on Sri Lanka government if foreign influence plays a role when Cabinet Ministers are chosen.
Addressing the media at his office yesterday, Minister Fonseka stressed that both leaders of the Yahapalana Government President Siriena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe must take the full responsibility for the major electoral setback suffered by the government at the February Local Government polls.
We have miserably failed in the last three years to fulfill the pledges given at two elections in 2015. The people in 2015 voted for President Sirisena in January and to the UNP in August mainly to expose murderers, financial crimes, embezzlements and other misdeeds committed under Mahinda Rajapaksa regime and bring members of the Rajapaks family before the law and punish them. This did not happen as expected. The President should be held responsible for not taking action against the Rajapaksas. People voted en-mass against the government at the LG polls not because they had a special affection to the SLPP but because they had been disappointed over the governments failure. Both the leaders should be held responsible for these failures, Minister Fonseka stressed.
Minister Fonseka expressed his dismay and displeasure on the continuous refusal by courts to give permission to the CID to arrest Gotabhaya Rajapaksa for alleged offences committed by him. He cannot prove his innocence only by retaining big time legal counsel by paying big cash. Can an average citizen have this luxury from the courts He asked.
It was sad that voters have forgotten the unpardonable crimes committed by under Rajapaksa regime and how they destroyed the economy and country. They must not forget those sins only because the unity government did not perform to their expectations. If a member of the Rajapaksa family becomes the President at the next election, the repercussions would be terrible because he would be an absolute dictator with unrestricted power. He will abolish independent commissions, and take law and order into his hands, Minister Fonseka cautioned.
Those who do politics against Rajapaksas like him will have to go to jail for sure but not under six feet as suggested by some. There must be drastic change in the political culture but not the Constitution if we are to prevent such disasters.
Minister Fonseka held the media, Print, Electronic and Social for the political catastrophic political development taking place in the country right now by distorting the thinking of the people and their attitude. One cant forget the sins and crimes committed by someone only because the one who said he would do the needful to punish them failed in the act, he added.
It is a major distortion and hoodwinking by the mainstream media that highlighted only the Central Bank bond scam and forced the country to forget all crimes of the Rajapaksa regime. If one takes the pain to calculate the total value of frauds, embezzlements, waste of public money and commissions taken by politicians and officials closed to Rajapaksaa, it would exceed the loss of Rs. 10 billion incurred from the CB bond scam, he emphasized.
He said the unity government had passed a stormy period following the local government polls defeat, disintegration of the SLFP and several changes in the cabinet, all were the results of the weak performance of the government. Therefore, the government had to get its act together and work to fulfill pledges and provide relief to the people.
Minister Fonseka said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was the most suitable politician in the UNP to contest the 2020 Presidential election and therefore all UNPers must support him and unite under him.
I protected him from the very beginning and I will continue to do so in then future as well, he added. (Sandun A Jayasekera and Ajith Siriwardana)

TNA May Launch  Non-Violent Protest Campaign  Against Govt Soon
	

By
D.B.S. Jeyaraj
The Coalition Government of President Maithripala Sirisena and Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe may soon be facing a political challenge from an unexpected quarter, namely the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). The TNA regarded as the premier political configuration of the Sri Lankan Tamil people is becoming increasingly frustrated at what it perceives as the slow pace and tardy progress of the Constitution-making process. Therefore the TNA is planning to launch a non-violent protest campaign against the UNP-SLFP coalition Government if it continues to procrastinate and dilly-dally on this issue. If and when matters do reach a point where a political confrontation becomes inevitable, the TNA proposes to embark on a huge non-violent protest campaign to pressure the Government to expedite the making of a new Constitution.
The TNA currently comprises the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi (ITAK), Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) and Peoples Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE). Another constituent, the Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) has dropped out of the TNA because of alleged political differences. The TNA contested the August 2015 parliamentary polls under the house symbol of its chief constituent the ITAK (Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi) which is referred to in English as the FP (Federal Party). The TNA contesting as ITAK won sixteen seats consisting of fourteen elected and two national list MPs in the 2015 election. After the EPRLF pull-out the number has dropped to 15 from 16 MPs.
From the inception of the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government in 2015, the TNA has pursued a non-confrontational, conciliatory approach towards the regime. In spite of TNA parliamentary group leader Rajavarothayam Sampanthan becoming the leader of the opposition, the TNA has co-operated with the Government in many ways like voting for the Budget etc. The TNA even voted against the no-confidence motion brought by sections of the opposition against incumbent Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Despite much criticism from hawkish elements on either side of the ethnic divide, the TNA has adopted this collaborative relationship with the ruling regime for the primary purpose of enacting a new Constitution. The TNA has been hopeful that a new Constituted formulated through a consensual approach with the full participation of the Tamil MPs in the Constitution drafting process could help resolve the Tamil national question through an effective power-sharing arrangement providing maximum devolution possible to the pre-dominantly Tamil Northern Province and the Tamil majority Eastern Province.
In fairness to the Yahapalanaya/Nallaatchi/Good Governance Government it did proceed with sincerity to implement its pledged commitments towards Constitution-making. The Government of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe formulated a different approach towards Constitution-making as opposed to similar exercises in 1972 and 1978. Initially a framework resolution was passed on March 9, 2016, by which all 225 Members of Parliament converted themselves into a Constitutional Assembly. The Constitutional Assembly is chaired by the Speaker Karu Jayasuriya. A constitutional assembly secretariat was also established.

Constitutional Assembly Steering Committee
On April 5, 2016 the Constitutional Assembly set up a 21-member Steering Committee comprising Parliamentarians of different hues. The composition of the steering committee reflected the configuration of different political parties as represented in Parliament. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe became the Steering committees chairman. Other members of the Steering Committee are Lakshman Kiriella, Nimal Siripala de Silva, Rauff Hakeem, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, A.D. Susil Premajayantha, Rishad Bathiudeen, Patali Champika Ranawaka, D. M. Swaminathan, Mano Ganesan, Malik Samarawickrama, Rajavarothyam Sampanthan, Anura Dissanayake, Dilan Perera, Dinesh Gunawardena, Jayampathy Wickramaratne, M. A. Sumanthiran, Ms. Thusitha Wijemanne, Bimal Rathnayake, Prasanna Ranatunga and Douglas Devananda.

According to the envisaged Constitution drafting procedure the Steering Committees task was to prepare the Draft Constitutional Proposal for consideration of the Constitutional Assembly

The Steering Committee identified 12 main subject areas. It was decided by the Steering Committee that certain subjects would be dealt with directly by the Committee itself. Those were matters covered by Chapter 1 and 2 of the present Constitution, Nature of the State, Sovereignty, Religion, Form of Government, Electoral Reforms, Principles of Devolution and Land. The other six subjects were assigned to specially set up sub-committees.
The Steering Committee on April 28, 2016 resolved that a Management Committee should be appointed to make arrangements and facilitate the work of the Steering Committee, Sub-Committees, and all secretarial work including staff requirements. Accordingly, the following persons were appointed as members of the Management Committee: Jayampathy Wickramaratne, MP  Co-chairman, M.A. Sumanthiran, MP  Co-Chairman, Neil Iddawala, Chief of Staff, Deputy Secretary General of Parliament, and Secretary to the Steering Committee, Naufel Abdul-Rahman, Secretary to the Leader of the House of Parliament, Ms. Bimba Jayasinghe Tillekeratne PC, Additional Secretary (Legal Affairs) to the Hon. Prime Minister
The Constitutional Assembly at a sitting held on May 5th 2016, appointed six thematic Sub-Committees to assist the Steering Committee in drafting a constitutional proposal. The six sub-committees and their themes are Fundamental Rights, The Judiciary, Law and Order, Public Finance, Public Services and Centre-Periphery Relations. Each Sub-committee consists of 11 members, including the Chairman. The six Chairmen were appointed from among the members selected to the Sub-Committees based on considerations of seniority.
According to the envisaged Constitution drafting procedure the Steering Committees task was to prepare the Draft Constitutional Proposal for consideration of the Constitutional Assembly. Once the Constitutional draft proposals were accepted and approved by the Constitutional Assembly with a two-thirds majority, it would be submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers. Thereafter the cabinet was expected to approve them -- with or without changes - and present the Constitutional provisions to Parliament as a bill to get passed by a two-thirds majority. Following which, the approval and sanction of the people would be obtained by way of an Island-wide referendum. With that Sri Lanka hopefully would once again be able to have a new Constitution.
The steering committee was required to present both an interim report and a final report. The Reports of the six Sub Committees and another report by an ad-hoc Committee appointed by the Steering Committee were tabled before the Constitutional Assembly on 19th November and 10th December 2016 respectively. The Interim Report of the Steering Committee dealt with the remaining subjects that were not assigned to any Sub-Committee and also contained principles and formulations that reflected the deliberations of the Steering Committee.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe
The Constitutional assembly Steering Committee met 73 times between April, 2016 and September, 2017. The Constitutional Assembly Steering Committees Interim Report was presented to Parliament in its Constitutional Assembly Avatar by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is also the committee Chairman.The committee had accomplished the first part of its mandate through the presentation of its interim report on September 21, 2017. The Parliamentary debate on the interim report was held for five days in the last week of October and first week of November 2017. There was no vote taken as the Steering committee comprising representatives of all political formations in Parliament had approved the interim report. The debate provided much time for all concerned to air their views publicly. It was expected that the Steering Committee final report would be compiled and completed by the end of the year and placed before the Constitutional Assembly/Parliament in January 2018.

What is required now is for the Govt to take certain policy decisions at one level and for the Steering Committee to meet and arrive at definite conclusions at another level
Unfortunately there was very little forward movement on the Constitutional front since then. The personality clash between President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, the simmering tensions between the UNP and SLFP elements within Govt folds, the Local authority poll electoral campaign, the Central Bank treasury bonds scam related matters, the no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister etc., resulted in a standstill in constitution making matters.
This lack of progress on the Constitutional front has had a tremendous impact on the TNA in general and its leader Sampanthan in particular. Trincomalee district MP and leader of the opposition Rajavarothayam Sampanthan is the senior-most Tamil leader in Parliament today. Born in February 1933 the 85-year-old TNA leader has participated in almost every meaningful attempt to bring about a negotiated settlement to the Tamil national question over the past 40 years since 1977. 
Currently Sampanthan and TNA lawyer - parliamentarian MA Sumanthiran have fully involved themselves with the Constitutional assembly tasked with the formulation of a new constitution. They have dedicated themselves to the task of achieving political equality for Tamils on the Island through this envisaged constitution. The overseas tigers are strongly opposed to the current constitution making exercise. That is why they and their acolytes in Sri Lanka display venomous hatred towards Sampanthan and Sumanthiran who are fully supportive of and are immersed in the Constitutional exercise.
Sampanthan has hitched the TNA wagon to the new Constitution star and would very much like to attain his political objectives in the near future. Being an octogenarian he knows that the sands of time are running out. Sampanthan realises and recognizes that the best possible chance to bring about a satisfactory resolution of the Tamil question through acceptable power sharing arrangements in a new Constitution is under this Govt. In meetings with International leaders, diplomats and senior officials ,the TNA leader has consistently and constantly requested that the Govt should be encouraged and supported to bring about a new Constitution ensuring equal rights and power sharing arrangements.

Local Authority Election Results
The constructive support extended by the TNA to the Sirisena - Wickremesinghe Govt has had a negative fallout too. The recent local authority election results indicated that the TNA had lost considerable support in the Tamil areas of the North and East. The TNA came first in 41 Pradeshiya sabhas/sabhais and the councils it contested in the North-east but obtained outright majorities in only four. More importantly the total number of votes polled in the 2018 local polls dropped by 34% when compared to the 2015 Parliamentary elections. One of the chief reasons - if not the sole reason -- for such a decline is attributed by some analysts to the TNAs association with the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe regime.

The TNA cannot show the fruits of cooperation by way of jobs,schemes or projects because it does not have ministerial portfolios. It has only sought to redress Tamil grievances and accommodate legitimate Tamil aspirations

Unlike other political parties representing the Muslim and Up Country Tamil communities the TNA did not seek ministerial office in this Government. The TNA cannot show the fruits of cooperation by way of jobs,schemes or projects because it does not have ministerial portfolios. The TNA has only sought to redress Tamil grievances and accommodate legitimate Tamil aspirations through cooperation with the Government. Although there has been some progress in issues like return of military held lands back to civilian owners and release of Tamil detainees etc there is little progress in the prized objective of the TNA namely Constitutional reform or a new Constitution. To the TNA in general and Sampanthan in particular it was a single item political agenda -a new Constitution.

However as stated earlier the progress on the Constitution front has been slow and not up to the mark. Moreover there was no progress at all after the Steering Committee Interim Report was presented and debated upon last year. There was a general impression that the Constitutional process was paralysed after the interim report was presented. This affected the TNA badly in the polls. It was unable to effectively present strong proof that its cooperation with the Govt was indeed paying dividends. The TNA was depicted by its hardline opponents as either a diabolical or naive entity. At worst the TNA had sold out like a charlatan and at best the party had been taken for a ride like a fool.This impacted to a great extent in the local poll results. 
Thus the TNA faced the prospect of further political decline within its constituency if it continued to cooperate with the Government without gaining anything on the Constitutional front. The TNA is in a dilemma. Either it gets the Government to deliver on the new constitution or it has to exit from its current stance of lending constructive support.
It is against this backdrop that TNA leader Sampanthan had separate meetings with President Sirisena and Premier Wickremesinghe last month. Sampanthan urged both to revive and renew the Constitution making process. Both assured the opposition leader that the Constitutional Assembly Steering Committee would be convened after the re-allocation of portfolios to cabinet ministers,state ministers and deputy -ministers. Now that the scientific re-shuffle is over the TNA expects the President and Prime Minister to demonstrate their bona fides by delivering on the new Constitution.

Jayampathy Wickramaratne and MA Sumanthiran
It is learnt reliably that despite the lull in the convening of the Constitutional Assembly steering committee, considerable progress has been made in drafting by the management committee co-chaired by Jayampathy Wickramaratne and MA Sumanthiran. What is required now is for the Govt to take certain policy decisions at one level and for the Steering Committee to meet and arrive at definite conclusions at another level. If political agreement is reached at multiple levels and the green light is given the final report of Constitutional proposals by the Steering committee or the draft constitution proposals would be ready for presentation to the Constitutional Assembly within two weeks. For all this to happen the political will, courage and strength must be there for the Government.

This lack of progress on the Constitutional front has had a tremendous impact on the TNA in general and its leader Sampanthan in particular

Bitter experience of defaulting Governments over the years and current political realities have naturally made the TNA wary. It is no longer willing to trust the Government fully on this count and provide carte blanche. If the Govt is found to be dilly-dallying or procrastinating without convening the Steering Committe, the TNA will for the first time since January 2015 confront the Govt politically.
The ITAK and TNA spokesman, MA Sumanthiran in an interview given to a Tamil TV on April 21st 2018 made an announcement to this effect. Sumanthiran said that if the Government does not deliver within a reasonable period of time the TNA would launch a totally non - violent protest campaign to demonstrate to the world at large that the Govt is not fulfilling its promises about formulating a new Constitution.
According to informed Tamil sources the TNA game-plan seems to be this. The TNA will be urging the Government to show progress on the Constitutional front by convening the Steering Committee and working on a Constitutional draft in May and early June. Meanwhile the chief constituent of the TNA the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi (ITAK) will hold its biennial party convention in late June. If the Govt does convene the Steering Committee and there is forward movement by that time the ITAK convention will approve and endorse the efforts through a resolution.If on the other hand the Govt does not move forward and defaults on its assurances before early June, the ITAK Convention would pass a different resolution calling for large -scale non-violent direct action protesting the Governments inaction and drawing the attention of the world. Thereafter the TNA also would meet and ratify the ITAK resolution. This would be followed by the launch of a non - violent protest amounting to a civil disobedience campaign on Gandhian lines of Ahimsa and Satyagraha.

Historical Precedent in Tamil Politics
There is a historical precedent in Tamil politics for this. In 1961 the ITAK/FP launched a Satyagraha campaign that paralysed the work of Kachcheris in the Jaffna, Mannar, Vavuniya, Batticaloa and Trincomalee districts. (There were no Mullaitheevu or Kilinochchi districts then). The campaign lasted for weeks and was finally crushed by the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Govt through the deployment of the armed services and the house arrest of prominent Tamil leaders. Prior to the commencement of the campaign the ITAK held its party convention and passed a unanimous resolution calling for a non - violent campaign.
Likewise the ITAK convention in 2014 during the Rajapaksa regime also passed a resolution calling for a massive non - violent protest campaign. The ITAK was planning to launch its campaign in January 2015 and began making preparations. Thousands of headgear known as Gandhi capshad been stitched. The Congress party in India launched many non - violent campaigns under the guidance of Mahatma Gandhi against British rulers during the colonial period. All Congress volunteers participating in the non - violent campaigns wore the Gandhi caps. The ITAK which has a history of being inspired by Gandhian ideals and methods planned to stage a non - violent campaign with volunteers wearing Gandhi caps then. However the political situation changed in November with former president Mahinda Rajapaksa calling for an early election. The TNA backed the common opposition candidate Maithripala Sirisena who defeated Rajapaksa on January 8th 2015. 
History was made. Thereafter the TNA shelved the idea of a non - violent campaign as unnecessary and commenced its co-operative phase with the new President and Government.

Campaign Not Confined To Tamils Alone
Now due to the lack of progress on the Constitutional front the TNA may be compelled to launch a non - violent campaign again. According to TNA sources the campaign unlike in the past would not be confined to Tamils alone.It would seek to embrace all shades of opinion supportive of greater devolution in a new Constitution. By this the ITAK/TNA will seek to De-ethnicise the quest for a new Constitution and greater devolution. 
Moreover the protest demonstrations would not only be held in Sri Lanka but held simultaneously in all international cities in the West with substantial Tamil Diaspora concentrations and in India ,Malaysia, South Africa, Singapore and Mauritius. The idea is to draw attention to the legitimate Tamil cause and enlist international support for a new Constitution. 
Furthermore the Non - violent protest campaign and its resultant political fall-out will enable the TNA to make a break with this Govt. Although the TNA is not an intergral component of this Govt it is perceived as an extensionof the regime in some matters. The TNA needs to break out of this image trap in order to face elections successfully. If there is progress on the Constitutional front the TNA can utilise it to political advantage.If there is no progress then the TNA needs to exit from this Collaborative relationship with the Govt. Hence the protest campaign can pave the way for the TNA to liberate itself from Govt bondage
This then is the prevailing political situation concerning the TNA. It appears that the Tamil alliance would have no option but to launch a non - violent campaign against the present Govt if there is no forward movement on the making of a new Constitution. This in turn could alter the political situation drastically. It is advisable that the TNA exercises restraint and patience as far as possible without rushing into direct action. After all the differences with the current Govt amount to friendly contradictions more than fundamental contradictions.

Shortage Of Pragmatism And Common Sense
Even though the TNA is planning to commence a non - violent protest campaign on Gandhian lines it is to be hoped that the need to launch such a campaign does not arise. For that to happen President Sirisena and Premier Wickremesinghe must patch up their differences, put their house in order and pursue a realistic policy of Constitutional reform with sincerity. For all that to happen there is an immense need for pragmatic common sense to prevail among all concerned.Sadly there is a serious shortage of pragmatism and common sense among Sri Lankan politicians right now.

Top Officials Arrested; Good Governance at last
	

The yahapalana government has often been widely criticised for going slow if not having back door deals in cases relating to large scale bribery, corruption or fraud by politicians and top officials. But the government got a major boost on Wednesday when two top officials were arrested by the Commission Investigating Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC).
Dr. I.H.K. Mahanama, the Presidents Chief of staff and the State Timber Corporation (STC) Chairman P. Dissanayaka were arrested by CIABOC officers while they were accepting a bribe of Rs.20 million from an Indian company official for the transfer of land, buildings and equipment of the Kantale Sugar Factory. Dr. Mahanama was earlier the secretary to the land ministry and is one of the highest ranking government officials to be arrested on bribery charges in recent decades. Dr. Mahanama and Mr. Dissanayaka were produced before Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara at his Sarana Road residence. CIABOC officers said that the two top officials had initially sought a bribe of more than Rs.540 million, but had later agreed to reduce it to Rs.100 million. They were caught at the car park of a luxury hotel in Colombo while accepting an initial payment of Rs.20 million. The magistrate ordered that they be remanded till May 9. 
State Television said yesterday, President Maithripala Sirisena had expressed satisfaction over the arrest of the two top officials and ordered that they be suspended from the public service till the case was completed. He also assured the CIABOC, there would be no government interference in the case and the officers should go ahead with the efficiency, courage and independence they showed in arresting the top officials though at least one of them apparently worked closely with the president.

Since the introduction of the 19th amendment in April 2015 and an Independent Constitutional Council was appointed and this council in turn recommended appointments to the Independent Public Services Commission, the National Police Commission, the Judicial Services Commission and the CIABOC. Wednesdays dramatic arrest by the CIABOC proved its independence because apparently the President or the Prime Minister were not told of the move or asked whether the arrest should be made. This is how it should be and this is how we hope it would be in the future also with the independent commissions acting independently without being influenced by the President, the Prime Minister, Ministers, MPs or other politicians. 
Wednesdays arrest should also serve as a stern warning to officials that they would face arrest, jail terms and removal from service if they dared to rob public money by indulging in large scale bribery, corruption or other frauds relating to State projects. We also hope the CIABOC would act with similar efficiency, courage and independence even if such cases involved politicians including ministers. 
The yahapalana government, during the campaign for the presidential election on January 8, 2015 assured it would take action quickly against the former regimes top politicians and officials who are alleged to have plundered billions of rupees in public money. But the process has been unusually slow amid allegations of backdoor deals to stall or slow down the investigations. So far, the former regimes only top official arrested and remanded for some time has been the former presidents secretary Lalith Weerantunga. Cases are pending against the former presidents brother Basil Rajapaksa, former ministers and top officials but progress has been painfully and sometimes suspiciously slow. 
We hope that when parliament resumes sittings on May 8 after the prorogation, the Judicature Act will be presented soon with the amendments proposed by the Supreme Court. Then we would have three Special High Courts with three-judge benches to conduct daily sittings, in the morning and the afternoon, in cases related to bribery, corruption, fraud or other political crimes by politicians or officials. 
On Wednesday we saw good governance and transparency, accountability and independence in action. We hope we will see this often and yahapalanaya will turn from a bit of a joke it is now, into a pillar of justice and democracy with politicians and officials serving the people selflessly, sincerely and sacrificially. Anyone indulging in business, big time bribery, corruption, fraud or other political crimes must end up where they belong  in jail and in the garbage dumps of history.

## Title: Trump believes Iran is building a nuclear bomb

Trump believes Iran is building a nuclear bomb
	

The next few days are fraught with danger. One of the most momentous decisions of the century is about to be made. Will President Donald Trump certify or not that Iran is honouring the agreement made with the US and the other permanent members of the UN Security Council to end its nuclear enrichment research, which some observers argued (but not the CIA) was leading to an Iranian nuclear bomb 
Danger number one is that it will push Iran to break its side of the bargain and the fear of nuclear bomb manufacture will provoke Saudi Arabia to emulate Iran. Already the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, has charged that Iran is on a rampage. Danger number two is that Israel, no longer constrained by the negotiations led by John Kerry, President Barack Obamas Secretary of State, will launch a preemptive attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. Already there is talk- and some evidence -- that Iran likewise is gearing up for an attack on Israel. It will be a limited attack, a preemptive, preemptive attack, if you will, to warn the Israeli public of the cost of war. Iran could never win a war with Israel but it can inflict far more damage than was incurred with Israels previous wars against Arab nations. Militarily it is far stronger than when Iraq, led by Saddam Hussein, invaded it in 1980.
Now it has missiles that can match Israels, albeit it has no defensive iron shield like Israel. 
The war with Iraq of 1980-1988 was Irans darkest hour. It went on for eight years. Iraq used chemical weapons on a large scale. Iran refused to use them, with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini pronouncing that Islam did not allow weapons of mass destruction. The US, under President Ronald Reagan and Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, provided Saddam with intelligence. The West as a whole supported Saddam, as did the UN. To understand this one has to recollect how deep was the fear of the export of Irans Islamic fundamentalism. Its fundamentalism spread far beyond Irans borders, even into Sunni countries. 
Iran will not forget this. It has long made it wary of American policies. Trust was forged during the nuclear negotiations. But if Trump withdraws from the treaty then it will be never again. Like the pre-Trump CIA, I think there is no evidence that Iran will build nukes. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Khomeinis successor, has already said that would go against the Koran. But others will think thats what Iran will be up to. Tensions could rise to boiling point with Saudi Arabia and Israel and also with the US. 
It is important to remember, as John Hopkins professor, Vali Nasr writes in Foreign Affairs this month, Trump seems to believe that rolling back Iranian influence would restore order to the Middle East. But that expectation rests on a faulty understanding of what caused the breakdown in the first place. Iran did not cause the collapse. And containing Iran will not bring back stability. The 2003 US/UK invasion of Iraq was the trigger for instability. 
Iran no longer is dominated by those who regard their country as a cause not a country. The religious fervour of the 1979 revolution that overthrew the Shah has died down. Now the political leadership is largely pragmatic nationalists, although there are still plenty of hard-liners around. It has retreated towards the Shahs nationalism and moved away from fundamentalism. (By the way, the Shah when he was overthrown was trying to develop nuclear weapons with US help. The US thought that if Iran dominated the Gulf this would be a force for peace, ensuring Americas supply of oil.) 
Irans military strength is often overstated. Iran spends only 3% of its GNP on its military whereas Saudi Arabia spends 10% of a much larger GNP, Israel 6% and Iraq 4%. Iran spends only 13 billion US dollars a year compared with Saudi Arabias 64 billion. 
Irans strength is its militias and insurgents across the Middle East. They give support to Syrias Assad and the Shiites of Iraq. Iran calls this forward defence. They played an important role in the defeat of ISIS, which it saw correctly as a Sunni threat, indirectly supported by Saudi Arabia and Qatar. 
An important element in Irans political strength lies in its de facto alliance with Moscow. Moscow is 100% behind the nuclear agreement and, along with the Europeans and China, is struggling to persuade Trump to back down. Moscow found itself allied with Iran in Syria. By working together the two militaries and intelligence communities have built deep ties. The US cannot crack this alliance unless it invades. 
The bitter irony is that Trump, if he goes ahead with decertifying the nuclear treaty, will add to the instability, the propensity towards violence and anti-Americanism that lies at the heart of the Middle East.

US warns China of consequences of military buildup in South China Sea
	

The US on Friday warned China that it would face consequences for military buildup in the disputed South China Sea where Beijing has deployed anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missile systems. 
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said that the Trump administration has raised the issue with the Chinese leadership. We are well aware of Chinas militarisation of the South China Sea. Weve raised concerns directly with the Chinese leadership about this. And there will be near-term and long-term consequences, Sanders told reporters, responding to a question on the Chinese military build up in the South China Sea and other parts of the world. 
China on Thursday defended the deployment of anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missile systems in the disputed waters, saying it has indisputable sovereignty over the area. 
The Pentagon has also expressed concern over the Chinese military buildup in the disputed waters. 
We have been very vocal about our concerns about them militarising these artificial islands.
China has to realise that theyve benefited from the free navigation of the sea. And the US Navy has been the guarantor of that, Chief Pentagon Spokesperson Dana White told reporters. 
We will continue to do our operations and ensure that the Chinese understand that they cannot, and should not, be hostile and understand that the Pacific is a place in which much commerce goes through. And its in their interest to ensure that theres a free navigation of international waters, she said.

Won't let anyone influence me when doing my duty: SF
	
Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said no political authority would be able to pressure or influence him on how to conduct his duties as the minister in charge of protecting our wildlife.
He said he was happy he got the Wild Life, Sustainable Development portfolio in addition to Regional Development because the protection of wildlife was a national need.
The minister told a media conference that his top priority would be to find a sustainable solution to the human-elephant conflict and protect wild animals which were in danger of extinction.
I got invitations to accept many other important portfolios but I preferred the portfolio I received. I have already received inquiries from many politicians and businessmen on my new job and I am determined to put an end to poaching and the killing of elephants. But at the same time I must also protect farmers from being attacked by elephants as well as preserve their crops, he said.
The minister said special attention had to be drawn to visitors to the National Wild Life Parks as many of them behaved in ways that were harmful to wild animals.
"Those who visit wildlife sanctuaries think of it as an opportunity for merry making and partying which is wrong. Wildlife sanctuaries are meant for those who love wildlife and want to preserve it. If they want to drink, dance and play they must find some other place to do those things," the minister said.
He said he would consider setting up a special location for these fun seekers with a tank, tavern and other facilities to enjoy without harassing wild animals. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
