A recurring craze for importing coconuts
	
A certain purohita has presented a proposal to the highest decision- making body to import coconuts to meet the prevailing short supply in the local market.
This proposal came under fire particularly from a certain Diyawanna member from the Kurunegala district at the Green partys workshop held in Bentota recently.
By the way, this purohita had wooed approval for coconut imports without avail even in 2005. He is dead set on getting the green signal this time round despite the protests from a section of Green party Diyawanna members, they say.

Another case of two appointees to the same post
	
Here is another classic case in yahapalanaya where two appointees to the same high post are embroiled in a dog fight.
The story runs like this: The second in command of yahapalanaya appointed a member of his choice to the directorate of a certain state-owned insurance company when a person already appointed to the same post by the purohita handling finance was already settled in the seat. The second in commands late appointee called over to assume duties, but the person appointed by the purohita refused to budge an inch from the seat. And this led to a verbal duel between the first and second appointees.
Yahapalanaya authorities who wanted to settle this matter quietly immediately kicked the first appointee upstairs as the chair of a development bank.
However, once bitten twice shy, the man has vowed not to move from the seat until he gets specific instructions from the purohita who offered it to him.
So the stand-off continues to the great amusement of the employees of the company, they say.

BBS condemns issuing of vouchers for school uniforms
	
	The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS), today, condemned the distribution of vouchers to buy school uniforms and said this would heighten communal and racial tensions.
	The government should work out a more equitable method instead of issuing vouchers to buy school uniforms, as the present method is grossly unfair by the school children, said BBS General Secretary, the Ven. Galagodaathe Gnanasara Thera.
	He said the present system would worsen social stratification and that the government leaders were creating problems for the country.
	The government should provide a fixed rate instead of distributing vouchers to buy school uniforms. When we compare the voucher rates, we find they are really unjust, he said.
	He explained that the government should devise a national policy that includes a fixed rate for purchasing school uniforms.
	He said that, as a national organisation, they would suggest that giving Rs. 1000 to each student to buy their school uniforms would be fair, instead of issuing vouchers of differing amounts to different students. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Yoshitha Perera)

Will report to new COPE over CB Bond sale issue: Bandula
	
The joint opposition would report to the newly appointed Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) regarding the controversial Central Bank Bond sale once the budget period was passed in parliament, UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena said.
Addressing a news conference today at the Dr. N. M. Perera Centre, MP Gunawardena said the Central Bank Bond Sale was the main reason for the record depreciation of the rupee against the US Dollar.
"CB Governor Arjuna Mahendran who is responsible for these outcomes is nowhere to be seen. If someone needs to meet him, they would have to travel to Singapore to reach the governor. If current economic affairs keep continuing, the value of the rupee will end up at 150 against the Dollar," he said.
He said the government was on the opinion that no outsider is aware of the economic crisis in which the country is engulfed in today and therefore keep continuing to deceive people, members of the Stock Exchange as well as the foreign investors. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

There is a certain yahapalanaya purohita who has appointed several family members to high posts in his Ministry. 
These new bigwigs are said to be clueless regarding the powers and functions they have to discharge and the employees say that this is no matter for surprise because their only merit to high office is their kinship to the purohita.
What is worse, they say, is, that two of these guys have made it a habit to attend office drunk and bully the employees just for the fun of throwing their weight around.
Now the highly concerned Ministry employees have planned to take trade union action against the two topers and also to get the Police to subject them to a Breathalyzer test before pursuing the necessary legal action.

Fed rate hike expectations slowing inflows to  capital account: CB
	
		 		 
		 
			
The Central Bank (CB) yesterday said the inflows to the capital account slowing amid the expectation of the US Federal Reserve increasing interest rates.
Workers remittances in September grew 1.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) to US $ 584.2 million. The cumulative inflows from remittances in the first nine months rose 1.8 percent YoY to US $ 5182.2 million.
Earnings from tourism in September rose 35.9 percent YoY to US $ 584.2 million while the cumulative figure for the nine months hit US $ 2 billion mark, up 18.8 percent YoY.
The Colombo Stock Exchange saw an inflow of funds amounting to US $ 1.6 million in September, against an outflow of US $ 9.5 million a year ago.
However, the cumulative inflows for the first nine months in 2015 fell 80.6 percent YoY to US $ 9.2 million.
Inflows to the government by way of treasury bills, bonds, sovereign bonds and long-term loans in September rose 27.4 percent YoY to US $ 169.7 million.
However, again, the cumulative figure for the nine months fell 41.3 percent YoY to US $ 2599.1 million.
	Official reserves US $ 6.8bn in September
Sri Lankas gross official reserves stood at US $ 6.8 billion as at end-September 2015, equivalent to 4.2 months of imports.
Subsequent to the decision of the Central Bank on September 4, 2015 to accommodate greater flexibility in the determination of the exchange rate, the rupee has depreciated by 5.9 percent, resulting in an overall depreciation of 8.5 percent during the year up to December 8, 2015. 
Over the year, based on cross currency exchange rate movements, the Sri Lankan rupee appreciated against the euro by 2.5 percent, Australian dollar by 3.5 percent and the Canadian dollar by 6.7 percent while depreciating against the Japanese yen by 5.6 percent, the pound sterling by 5.4 percent and the Indian rupee by 3.6 percent.

This Diyawanna member who presided over education in the previous regime has got a knack for taking people by surprise. Quite recently he sprang a surprise on his colleagues from both sides of the divide when he declined to accept the prestigious chair of the councils accounts committee.
Practically all yahapalanaya top brass had earlier given their nod when the Senior Banda from the hills proposed the name of the onetime tuition master for the chair of the committee. They all had agreed that Economics being the mans forte, he could acquit himself well in this job.
However, true to his streak of doing the least expected, the former purohita, and now a heavyweight of the joint opposition had turned down the offer saying: Our group in the opposition accounts for about 50 members. But the government is not prepared to give due recognition to us. Therefore, I have decided not to accept this post
So the government had to look for another suitable person to head the committee, they say.

The government had released more than Rs.40 million to this particular provincial body on the eve of the January 8 big poll. Instead of utilizing the funding for development purposes, the politico had used the monies for the purchase of refrigerators, buffet sets and plastic chairs for distribution among his voters.
Meanwhile, the new top brass of this provincial body claims that only a handful of voters had received these gifts from their previous provincial boss. What is worse, no tender procedure had been observed for the purchase of the gift items.
This politico, now accused of criminal abuse of public funds for political gain, however, is a vociferous champion of social justice and fair play, they say.
By the way, the authorities of the provincial body concerned have decided to file a complaint against the politico with a Police unit tasked with probing financial crimes in thepublic sector.

	Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) today complained to the Human Rights Commission requesting that the regulation on lane restrictions enforced by the Police Department be removed.
	The Police Department now strictly enforces the law on lane restrictions in a bid to reduce traffic within the Colombo City limits.
	LPBOA President Gamunu Wijeratne asked for a separate lane for buses if the police continued to enforce the law.
	It is the commuters who are inconvenienced by this law. The buses have to crawl behind smaller vehicles and this consumes more time, he said.
	Nearly 13,000 buses enter the City daily, many of them are fined by the police under the recently enforced laws.
	Mr. Wijeratne said buses should be given more prominence on the road as it was a service that was provided to the people.
	He said the Police tested new traffic rules occasionally and the most affected were the buses and the commuters who travel in them.
	If the police does not withdraw the regulations soon we will take legal action, Mr. Wijeratne stated. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Mystery surrounding landmark lake sans water
	
There is a beautiful city in the hill country well known for its cool salubrious climate. A lake in the city adds to its scenic beauty. In fact, this city is a popular tourist destination in the country. In fact, there had been instances when amphibious planes carrying foreign tourists had landed on this lake.
This lake suddenly went dry laying bare the lake bed. Inquisitive media people made inquiries from authorities as to why the beautiful lake had gone empty. The authorities they contacted gave different explanations. One high official had said that the lake had been emptied of its water preparatory to a de-silting and cleansing project. Another authority had said that water had been pumped out to enable fixing some bund leaks.
However, people in the area say that the authorities cook up stories to hide the truth. According to them, there is an estate close to the lake belonging to a sibling of a powerful person. He wanted to construct a building complex overlooking the lake. Structural design engineers and architects who inspected the site for the building complex had warned this estate owner of the possibility that the water level of the lake could rise above the foundation level. And they had further advised him to empty the lake of the water if he wanted to go ahead with the building project. And the sibling of the powerful person using his political clout got the lake emptied of water to carry out his construction work - of course, not before erecting a sign board opposite the lake announcing that a lake development project was underway.

REITs  A welcome  new addition to  investment landscape
	
		 		 
		 
			
The Budget announcement on the potential introduction of real estate investment trusts (REITs) as an alternative investment class has evoked a heightened sense of activity across many quarters. Whilst the general consensus evinced by market experts and industry players is that there still remains a considerable amount of changes that are required in the financial infrastructure in order to accommodate REITs, it is undoubtedly a product that has already captured the imagination of local investors, despite its introduction in global markets several decades ago.
The technical aspects of REITs were covered in exhaustive detail in an article by Entrust Wealth Management and Entrust Capital Markets CEO Naushervan Beg published in a leading business newspaper less than a month ago and to do so again would make it somewhat redundant. However, suffice to say that REITs encapsulate several key elements that other products that generate a regular income stream, such as debentures, simply do not.
A key feature of REITs is that it represents a tangible and identifiable asset group and the investment returns would largely hinge on the underlying performance of the real estate portfolio that constitute the REIT. Therefore, whilst traditional debt products would largely depend on the overall performance of the issuer, and their performances are inextricably entwined with one another (company and the product), the REIT could be evaluated on its own merits, notwithstanding the performance of the issuing entity.
Furthermore, the REIT provides the regular income flow that investors in debt instruments aspire for, whilst also offering the potential for capital gain, if the underlying real estate portfolio increases in value.
REITs also act as viable conduit to channel medium to long-term equity/participation type capital into the real estate sector via the capital markets, which would be more stable than the traditional reliance on short-term loans or other similar debt-based borrowings. Existing real estate owners could also transfer their real estate land banks into a REIT structure, thereby freeing the liquidity to pursue their core business activities. For instance, even financial institutions (FIs) that own large extents of real estate as part of their investment portfolio could realise the cash equivalent without actually foregoing ownership since REITs can be structured for a limited time period if required and ownership would transfer back to the original owners (FIs) on maturity of the REIT.
There are other inherent features that further enhance the lustre of the REIT. There is undoubtedly a higher degree of transparency, especially in the case of listed REITs, a factor that is becoming increasingly important in the decision-making of investors. The real estate sector would also no longer be the exclusive domain of the HNWI and institutional investor, with small-time investors also being able to participate in an asset class whose beta would provide the much required diversification that an investment portfolio yearns for. This has been an espoused objective of successive governments, where the interests of the smaller investor have been a pivotal factor in the policymaking development of the markets, as a whole.
One should also not ignore a particular idiosyncrasy of the Sri Lankan market where real estate is the traditional go to investment for those with the financial wherewithal. Whilst equities, debentures et al could either be embraced or shunned, depending on individual risk appetites, real estate is a more vanilla-type of investment and does not have the intricacies associated with more complex investment products.
It is particular noteworthy that the Budget recommends a complete waiver of stamp duty for REITs, provided certain criteria are satisfied. The subject of REITs, in the aftermath of the Budget, will be the topic of a discussion where market experts would deliberate on at a presentation and panel discussion titled Creating the Real Estate Infrastructure to spur Economic Growth to be held on December 11, 2016.

Rupee firmer on exporter sales, inward remittances
	
		 		 
		 
			
REUTERS: The Sri Lankan rupee traded firmer yesterday due to dollar sales by exporters and on inward remittances ahead of the festival season, dealers said.
The rupee was at 143.15/25 per dollar at 0647 GMT compared with Mondays close of 143.25/35.
We were expecting selling to come in. We saw the selling which we have been expecting, said a currency dealer, asking not to be named.
We saw exporter dollar sales and remittances, the rupee will strengthen for the next few days unless state bank comes and buys again.
Dealers said inward remittances for the festival season starting mid-December would take some pressure off the local currency in the short term.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe last week warned of pressure on the currency due to a China-led global slowdown and a possible Federal Reserve rate hike.
Sri Lanka is expected to seek an IMF stand-by arrangement to fend off a risk that its economy will be hurt next year by repercussions from events affecting major economies.
Sri Lanka has not made a formal request for International Monetary Fund help but the funds staff are looking at ways to help the island nation, an IMF spokesman said on Thursday.
The Central Bank on Monday conducted a repo auction for the first time since February 27 to absorb excess rupee liquidity. The bank accepted Rs.8.2 billion at 6.05 percent after receiving offers for Rs.10.3 billion.

Waxing desires in waning years
	
This plump and short senior purohita well past sixty is well known as a ladies man. The other day several Diyawanna members from both sides of the divide relaxing in the council lobby had great fun swapping juicy titbits about the purohitas latest fling.
One of the members said the old mans latest catch could not be more than 22.
I know her real age, chimed in another member. She is 27 though she looks younger! What is her job the question came from yet another member.
A doctor who has just completed her internship! replied the other member.
He added: Our man has bought her a posh house in a residential area not far away from here!
Some guys have all the luck, an elderly member lamented. You people know only this affair. But I know about three other affairs of our man, a member who was a silent listener all this while declared. Tell us, machang! the others implored. Not now! We should have something for another day! he said before beating a hasty retreat.
