The Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate and inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) had not recommended abolishing the civic rights of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as claimed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila said today.
Addressing a news conference, he challenged the Premier to point out whether it was mentioned in the PRECIFAC report that the civic rights of the former President should be stripped in connection with the allegations articulated in the report.
He further said that they were ready to render their fullest support to President Sirisena if he was keen to take instant actions against the bond scam offenders and other individuals who have been alleged to have links to the scam. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Fusion: The T20 of Indian music
	
Lakshminarayana Subramaniam left this country as a dispossessed child, too small to fully comprehend the disaster that befell his family in 1958 as racist mobs torched their home and chased them away. 
But the frightened little boy was already a violin prodigy. Music has wonderful healing powers, and whatever scars he suffered from that terrifying experience were overcome under the guidance of his musician parents V. Lakshminarayana Iyer and Seethalakshmi. He was already giving public performances at age six. Today, at seventy, he is Indias best known violinist, a composer whose work has been performed in the United States and Russia. He has collaborated with musicians the calibre of violinists Yehudi Menuhin, Stephane Grapelli and singer Stevie Wonder. He has been called the Paganini of Indian classical music.
Sri Lankans had the rare chance of watching a live performance by this diminutive musical dynamo last week at the BMICH, as the Indian High Commission invited him, his wife singer Kavitha Krishnamurti Subramaniam and daughter Bindu Subramaniam, who is a singer and composer in her own right. 
They were accompanied by an ensemble of eight musicians  Tannoy Bose (tabla), Sanjay Marathe (keyboards), Alwyn Fernandes (electric guitar, lead and rhythm), S. Satya Sai (percussion), Frijo Francis (jazz pianist and keyboardist), Keith Peters (bass guitar), Prasad Kulkarni (multi percussionist), and a solitary Sri Lankan -- Sarangan Sri Renganathan (sitar).
The worlds top musicians devise their own techniques no matter what instrument they play. French jazz violinist Stephane Grapelli devised his own unconventional playing methods and his partner, gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt amazed the world with his virtuoso guitar playing though the fingers of his left hand were badly mangled by an accidental fire at home. 
The damage caused to Subramaniam by fire was principally psychological. But his virtuosity too, may be in direct co-relation to that. When he plays, you can see something burning in him. But fire is an all-consuming entity which cannot be calculated, spreading out of control very quickly. This inner fire is a creatively calculated one. Its the energizer of Subramaniams technique, through which one musical tradition morphs into another, eastern into western, and this classical mix into something with folk origins, the tone colour sometimes fiery like the bluest of flames, with the awesome hues of a furnace blast, and then ebbing to tiny slivers of microtones. And it goes on and on.
"Today, many Indians would be surprised to hear that"
Could the flames of childhood fan the fires of maturity Each creative artist is a mystery, but in this case, one can draw a connection between the two. Dr. Subramaniams creative universe has a uniquely Indian feel to it, as if he was a deity of music with his singing muse by his side. Into this familial pantheon, even his tiny granddaughter is drawn, as she entertained the audience with a flawless version of a Sinhala baila song, accompanied by her grandmother.
Kaveetha Subramaniam is a Bollywood playback singer in the high tradition of Latha and Usha Mangeskar, Asha Bhosle and Suman Kalyanapur. Both husband and wife are products of rigorous classical training. But Kaveetha Subramaniam reached her present pinnacle as a playback singer under the tutelage of the great film music composer duo Lakshmikanth Pyarelal, and her gratitude to them was evident in the homage she paid to them that evening on stage.
In India, just as all other rivers seem to be dwarfed by the Ganges and the Jumna, all music is dominated overwhelmingly by two massive streams  the classical tradition and its flooded deltas of film music. Till the 1960s, the latter was scorned by the authorities, so much so that film music was banned on All India Radio (forcing Indian film makers to air their songs via Radio Ceylon). When Ravi Shankar was in charge of the AIR orchestra, he initially followed the steps of his elder brother Uday Shankar and frowned upon the use of western musical instruments, though later his name became indelibly associated with fusion experiments with the Beatles and Philip Glass. 
"Sri Lankans had the rare chance of watching a live performance by this diminutive musical dynamo last week at the BMICH, as the Indian High Commission invited him, his wife singer Kavitha Krishnamurti Subramaniam and daughter Bindu Subramaniam, who is a singer and composer in her own right"
Today, many Indians would be surprised to hear that. The tide is overwhelmingly in favour of popular music  be it film music or fusion. Just as innovative, far sighted film composers such as Naushad, Lakshmikanth Pyarelal, Shankar Jaikishan, S.D. Burman and his son Rahul Dev took film music away from its Bengali roots to a bastardised Western-eastern mixture, catering to a huge fan base hypnotized by the new sound, western musicians such as George Harrison, John McLaughlin, composer Philip Glass and violinist Yehudi Menuhin began experimenting with their Indian counterparts such as Ravi Shankar. The resulting fusion displeased many purists and was seen as a fad. But numbers count, and officialdom could no longer afford to ignore the new-fangled sound.
Today, its dominance of Indias music seems to be far out of proportion to the number of its proponents in India. Last year, percussionist and composer Bikram Ghosh was invited here by the Indian High Commission. Like Subramaniam, he too, played fusion. Officialdom has been bowled over by the new sound. It is dynamic compared to classical music, and politicians are quickly to see the potential of whatever moves the masses. Fusion has become the T20 of Indian music.
I am all for experimentation, but in this part of the world we are in danger of losing art forms, rhythms and literatures thousands of years old in the scramble for the new. In the West, despite all dire predictions that classical music is dying, there is a loyal fan base supporting a new generation of musicians interpreting Romantic, Baroque and other period music in ever more subtle ways. Over here, there was a time when one could find people who knew that the theme music of the radio drama Muwan Pelessa is derived from an Indian raga. But no one knows that any more.
"This music is incomparably rich in melody"
Despite this scramble to market new forms of music which match the frenetic rhythms of the economic powerhouse that modern India has become, the old India still exists underneath. India isnt just the film industry, and all Indian music isnt just film music. The ragas of both the north and south have been created out of the rhythms and pulse of ancient Indians and the soil they lived on. This is the music which powered the ancient India of Ajanta, Ellora and Mahaballipuram, created visually for us in films such as Herman Wouks Siddhartha or Bernardo Bertoluccis Little Buddha. 
This music is incomparably rich in melody. Indias modern film composers dip into this inexhaustible treasury when they create their hits. Harmony is what they borrow from the West, as Indias musical tradition is weak in harmony. Fusion is both melody and harmony. 
Congratulations to Subramaniam and other modern composers for bringing more vitality into that ancient musical idiom. But, after going home after the concert, I listened to a CD of Karnatic violin music by him, Kala Ramnath and Dr. N. Rajam (the latter two are female musicians) where the wailing violins sound uncannily like the human voice. It sounds like a concise emotional history of Indias past ages in notational form. Listening to this, and with that fusion reverberating inside my head, I am truly caught between two worlds.

Mud-slingers will be taught a good lesson on Feb.10: Kiriella
	
Minister Lakshman Kiriella said UNP supporters would teach political mud-slingers a good lesson on February 10.
Addressing a Local government election rally in Kandy, he said some people presumed they could defeat the UNP over the bond matter .
Our opponents should realise that the UNP is a political party with a strong foundation and a strong leadership. The Opposition requested a debate on the bond report and it was granted. Although Prime Minister wished to address the debate, the joint opposition and the JVP disturbed him. They argued how could they debate without having the bond report. At that point I asked them why they requested for a debate," the minister said.
He said the fullest support should be given to the Prime Minister at this decisive local government election by electing UNP candidates to the local bodies. "There is no doubt that we will be able to have a UNP president next time, if we win the local bodies at this election," the minister said.
He said the Central Expressway was launched and was now progressing. "We are sure it will be inaugurated in August 2020 and and when in operation will take only one hour to reach Colombo from Kandy. It is a given that the development of Kandy District depends on the Central Expressway.
The minister said a Free Trade Zone will be set up in Galagedera and that several such development projects would be launched in the Kandy District on the instructions of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

PMs call for bond scam debate: EC faces dilemma
	
Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said yesterday that he was in a dilemma over the move by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to call for a Parliamentary debate on February 8 on the two reports  one on the Central Banks bond scam and the other on serious frauds allegedly committed during the former rule.
The Prime Minister said on Saturday that he would request Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to call for a special session of Parliament to have this debate.
In a hurriedly summoned press conference, Mr Deshapriya said yesterday the day, identified for the debate, would fall within the "silence period" of the Local Authorities Elections.
He said all propaganda activities would be barred during the period ahead of the day of polling.
He said Parliamentary debate on a topic, with electoral sensitivity could have a bearing on the parties and groups in the fray.
However, he said he had no authority or moral right to overrule the Supremacy of Parliament.
The Elections Commission cannot think of doing it even. There is no provision for it, he said.
He said he was at a loss under these circumstances.
The Elections Commission will meet soon to take a decision in this regard.
The Prime Ministers decision for a special Parliamentary session came in the wake of President Maithripala Sirisena speaking of An unholy alliance of bandits to cover up their frauds and corruption by postponing the debate on the bond scam and the other report.
The President said both the political factions would get exposed in the event of such a debate. (By Kelum Bandara)

The biggest issue at hand was the report of PRECIFAC, as it had recommended stripping former President Mahinda Rajapaksas Civic Rights for life, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said at an election rally in Deniyaya.
He said that those who suggested the SLFP and Joint Opposition should unite, should consider the recommendations made by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges, whether the two parties could get together in a situation, where the Commission had called for the stripping of Mr Rajapaksa's Civic Rights," he said.
The Premier said that he had requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to convene Parliament on February 8, 2018, to take up the debate on Bond Commission report and the PRECIFAC Report.
"There is no issue in having a debate on the Bond Commission report as there is nothing new about it. We have had several debates on the issue, he said.
Mr Wickremesinghe reiterated that the ruling party should be given the mandate to run local bodies to avoid political turmoil that may occur if local bodies headed by other parties sabotage development work.
Minister of Law and order Sagala Ratnayake said the Minister of Justice would submit a paper pertaining to the setting up of Special courts to hear corruption cases in a few days time.
Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said it would not be possible to change the President or the Prime Minister after the Local Government election as it was only a poll held to elect representatives for local bodies.(Yohan Perera)

An elite group of climbers saved a French mountaineer in a daring high-altitude rescue mission on Pakistans Nanga Parbat, one of the highest mountains in the world, as officials called off the search for a second missing alpinist on Sunday. 
The group of Polish climbers with support from the Pakistani military launched the effort Saturday afternoon to rescue stranded French mountaineer Elisabeth Revol, but were unable to reach Polish national Tomek Mackiewicz on Nanga Parbat, nicknamed killer mountain. 
The rescue for Tomasz is unfortunately not possible - because of the weather and altitude would put the life of rescuers in extreme danger, wrote Ludovic Giambiasi, a friend of Revol, in a series of updates on Facebook. 
The team is in the process of being evacuated by helicopter after a five and a half hour descent down the mountain to Nanga Parbats camp one early Sunday.

SLPP challenges Govt. to strip MR of his civic rights
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) today challenged the government to strip former president Mahinda Rajapaksa of his civic rights if possible.
SLPP chairman G.L. Peiris said former president J.R. Jayawardane had stripped the civic rights of former prime minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike fearing an election defeat.
Mr. Jaywwardene knew there was a person who was more popular than him in politics. Therefore, he cut down his opponent politically. The entire country is waiting for Mr. Rajapaksas leadership. If he was intimidated politically, we will see how the people will react. Just abolish his civic rights and see the consequences, he told a news briefing.
Mr. Peiris said this in response to a statement made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that the PRECIFAC report had recommended the cancellation of Mr. Rajapaksas civic rights.
He said there is a political tone to the PRECIFAC report and asked why the PCoI and PRECIFAC reports are being taken up for debate simultaneously.
The is no connection between the two reports. The Bond scam is the biggest ever scam to take place in the country. It is to soften the impact of bond scam and divert the attention that the PRECIFAC report had been coupled with the Bond report, Prof. Peiris said.
Responding to President Maithripala Sirisenas allegations about an elite robber gang, he said the President was its leader.
Otherwise, why dissolve Parliament to save those involved in the first bond scam and make way for a second one, Prof. Peiris said and added that President should be honest when saying he was ready to form a government if all UPFA MPs stand by him.
He said government leaders are acting a drama which is being staged at four levels during the election campaign.
The first drama is where the SLFP and the UNP are saying the debate on the PCoI and PRECIFAC reports cannot be held before the election. The second drama is where the President is calling for an early debate followed by the third drama in which Prime Minister requested the Speaker to hold it on February 8. The last drama is to get the polls delayed based on the parliamentary debate. We urge the Elections Commission not to postpone the polls, Prof. Peiris said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Sri Lanka, all talk no action on repealing PTA: HRW
	
The Sri Lankan government has failed to fulfill its pledge to abolish the abusive Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), the Human Rights Watch (HRW) said today.
In a 46-page report, it said the PTA has been used for decades to arbitrarily detain suspects for months and often years without charge or trial, facilitating torture, and other abuse.
The Sri Lankan government has been all talk and no action on repealing the reviled PTA. Replacing this draconian counterterrorism law with one that meets international standards should be an urgent priority if the government is serious about protecting human rights HRW Asia DirectorBrad Adams said.
The report titled, Locked Up Without Evidence: Abuses under Sri Lankas Prevention of Terrorism Act, has documented previous and ongoing abuses committed under the PTA, including torture and sexual abuse, forced confessions, and systematic denials of due process.
Drawing on interviews with former detainees, family members, and lawyers working on PTA cases, the HRW has found that the PTA is a significant contributing factor toward the persistence of torture in Sri Lanka.
The 17 accounts documented in the report represent only a tiny fraction of PTA cases overall, but they underscore the laws draconian nature and abusive implementation, the HRW said.
