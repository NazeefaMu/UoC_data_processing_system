Mr. Vithanage said the monk is violating the country?s Constitution and is providing support to foreign forces in order to destroy the country?s image. ?

?Ceylinco VIP On The Spot? policyholders to get Rs.4mn health cover
	
By Chandeepa Wettasinghe
Sri Lanka?s largest private insurance company Ceylinco General Insurance Ltd announced that all of its ?Ceylinco VIP On The Spot? comprehensive policyholders will receive a Rs.4 million emergency hospitalisation cover for no additional?premium charge.
?This is another innovation of the ?VIP On The Spot? brand... you won?t believe a Rs.4 million health cover without a cent added to your premium,? Ceylinco General Insurance CEO Ajith Gunawardena said.
According to the policy extension, in the event of a road accident within Sri Lanka, a customer can claim up to Rs.1.3 million for hospitalisation and follow-up treatments overseas?if recommended.
If the policyholder is travelling overseas, a Rs.1.3 million cover is available for any medical emergency, including visiting a general practitioner, and a Rs.2.6 million hospitalisation cover for any accident -- up to 15 days?per trip.
?10-12 percent of our customers travel abroad,? Gunawardena said.Further, overseas travellers will be covered up to Rs.1.3 million in the case of death or total permanent disablement and Rs.650,000 in case of permanent partial disablements.All our new customers will have these benefits from today. For our existing customers, the benefits will occur when they renew their policy,? Gunawardena noted.
The benefits are for customers who have a comprehensive insurance policy on their cars, vans, jeeps, double cabs, buses and lorries. Motorcycle policyholders will be entitled to a Rs.300,000 hospitalisation cover for a road traffic accident locally and all the benefits of other vehicles when travelling overseas.
Customers who have only subscribed to a third party policy will benefit with a personal accident cover of Rs.200,000 for hospitalisation and Rs.100,000 for third party motorcycle policyholders.
?This cover is only for you. In the future we can think of extending the cover,? Gunawardena added.
Ceylinco Insurance PLC Managing Director Patrick Alwis said that only 17 percent of Ceylinco VIP On The Spot customers have a third party policy.
?We have a 35 percent market share on vehicle insurance with a 1.1 million customer base and the company handles around 580 accident claims daily, around 17 percent of which report injury or death,? Alwis added.
While vehicle insurance is mandated by the government, Sri Lankan insurance companies have struggled to penetrate into the population with health and life insurance covers. Ceylinco Insurance has a 41 percent market share in the current health insurance market. The move by Ceylinco could be seen as a way to whet the appetite of Sri Lankans to subscribe to more comprehensive health and life insurance covers in the future. However, Alwis said that it is just a practice of value addition to retain their high market share.?This is value addition. Motor insurance was a tariff product and the tariff was removed in 2003. We still charge the same rate we did in 2002, though prices of vehicles have gone up. Other companies are now charging 35-60 percent less than us to try to gain our market share. We never entered the price war. We?re continually value adding while maintaining our tariff to keep our customers,??he said.

<U+200B>ITN rejects live telecast of UPFA manifesto-UPFA
	
	The state owned Independent Television Network (ITN) has refused a request to telecast live the UPFA election manifesto,which is to be launched today, asserting that it has to accommodate the already scheduled programmes of the channel -- in a letter sent by ITN to the general secretary of the UPFA.
The letter, signed by ITN chairman Dhammika Ganganath Dissanayake and sent to UPFA general secretary Susil Premajayantha said that, although there were a large number of requests to telecast paid election related advertisements on the channel, due to the earlier scheduled programmes and election advertisements, the channel was not able to accommodate all of them.
The letter also said the channel had taken a decision to offer one opportunity to each political party to have its main convention telecast, without interrupting television programmes; and it had already received election related advertisements.
In his reply to the ITN chairman, Mr. Premajayantha had criticised ITN's decision and said that the channel was biased towards the governing party.
?It is not clear why you have rejected our request when you have given equal opportunities to both the UNP and the JVP. We believe that your rejection of our request is unfair,? the letter said.

Looking forward to prove MR's guilt in court: Ranjan
	
Commenting on the Letter of Demand sent by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayaka for defaming him, Mr. Ramanayaka said he looked forward to prove Mr. Rajapaksa?s guilt in court.
The former President had demanded Rupees one billion from the Deputy Minister in damages over an alleged defamatory statement of him in a TV political programme.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Mr. Ramanayaka said he was responsible for what he said and not scared of anyone to reveal the truth since he possessed the documents as evidence.
He said former President Rajapaksa should be charged of having siphoned off Tsunami funds in 2005. He said the investigations initiated in 2005 under then Senior DIG were halted due to the Presidential Elections where Mr. Rajapaksa was elected as the President.
According to him, the court case has been filed against Mr. Rajapaksa by the former UNP MP Kabir Hasheem.
Mr. Ramanayaka said he received the files regarding the case from Mr. Hasheem and the DIG so that he would be able to produce them before the court when Mr. Rajapaksa?s party appears before the hearings.
?I am ready for anything. What I have to tell him is let?s meet at the court,? he said.
His lawyers had sent letters of demand to five persons who had allegedly tried to insult him by making defamatory comments.
They had warned that in the event they fail to pay the aforementioned sum within 14 days, legal action would be instigated against them. (Piyumi Fonseka)

	Several ministers including Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Ranjan Ramanayake, Nalin Bandara, Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the leader of the Gypsies band, Sunil Perera have been accused of engaging in activities that have defamed ex-President Mahinda Rajapakse during various TV talk shows. As a result of these practices, MR had sent letters of demand to these five individuals. Moreover, they have been charged one billion rupees each except for Minister Mangala Samaraweera who has been charged Rs.500 million.
	Speaking to the Daily Mirror, several of them expressed their thoughts on this move taken by the ex-President.
	In his comments, Leader of the Gypsies band, Sunil Perera said everybody should have the freedom to voice their opinions. ?During his regime people were not able to voice their opinions but people have that freedom now. I really don?t know what has made him take this action against me, but I think he should have a right to take action if he feels that I have done something to defame him.?Kurunegala district MP Nalin Bandara said, ?I still haven?t got it into my hands. They are trying to shut our mouths but I don?t think their attempts will be successful. We all have evidence to prove there have been malpractices taking place. If MR is planning to file cases against us and keep us silent, I think that will never happen. We will continue to reveal all corrupt practices done by him. He is contesting from Kurunegala district and he once battled with President Maithripala Sirisena and PM and is now trying to battle with us and I am quite happy about it. As a result MR has become even more unpopular due to these kinds of acts. Also I only mentioned that during the time of the CHOGM, MR and his clan has not settled a bill of Rs. 94 lakhs. So what happened to this sum??
	JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said he was happy to meet MR in courts. ?I hope that all frauds done by mega projects and the information revealed from ongoing investigations could be produced before courts at some point.? (Kamanthi Wickramasinghe)

	Further magisterial inquiry into the matter was postponed for tomorrow (28).
	The former Havelocks SC captain Wasim Thajudeen was killed, apparently, in a road accident in Colombo in May 2012.
