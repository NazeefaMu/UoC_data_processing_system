Aussie PM fined $250 for not wearing a lifejacket
	
Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has been fined $250 for not wearing a lifejacket while steering his inflatable dinghy near his Point Piper mansion on Sydney Harbour, the Guardian reported.
The prime minister was photographed at the helm of the motorised dinghy by the Australian newspaper on Wednesday. He was wearing a red rashvest but no lifejacket, a breach of New South Wales maritime regulations.
Turnbull said he was only moving the boat 20m between a jetty and the beach next to the house he shares with his wife Lucy while at home over Christmas.
After reports accompanying the photograph noted his breach of regulations, Turnbull said in a Facebook post the first he had learned of the rule was when he called Maritime Services.
The rules can often seem very technical, but they are there to keep us safe and we should all comply with them, he said.
So lesson learned; I will make sure I always wear a life jacket in my dinghy regardless of how close I am to the shore, just as I always do on my kayak.
Maritime Services investigated the incident and on Friday delivered a $250 fine. A spokesman for Turnbull said the fine would be paid.
Angus Mitchell, executive director of NSW Maritime, said the incident was a timely reminder of the need for safety on the water.
We want to ensure everyone enjoys their break and gets home safely this summer so please, wear a lifejacket and take care on our waterways, he said.

Christmas cacophony
	

Thank God for small mercies. Christmas has come and gone, but this year, the commercialized cacophony of Christmas was hardly heard. The noisy parties might have been held, but not many people seem to have gone on a shopping spree.
I, for one ,was glad that people have at last realized that Christmas could be a happy one without anybody going on a crazy shopping spree and then complaining that the cost of living is so high.
The cause of the high prices during the Christmas season is because there is a high demand for the goods
When I was teaching Economics in Batticaloa, I taught my students that one basic law of Supply and Demand is that a rise price diminishes demand. I had to tell the children that while it may be so, it does not apply to Sri Lanka, because here the people would buy only if the price is high. Those children were somewhat amused by it, because Batticaloa is generally a poverty-stricken area. So they were not used to the idea of going on a shopping spree. I had to tell them that in Colombo, this is, in fact the case. People attach more value to a good only if the price is high. So invariably they end up buying goods when they are expensive, and this pushes the demand for them still further. This is termed Demand pull inflation and the whole country is gripped in it well and truly.
If people refrain from buying too much,the sellers would be compelled to reduce the prices and something that no Government could do, would have been accomplished by the people

The cause of the high prices during the Christmas season is because there is a high demand for the goods. It may not be so in poorer villages, but it certainly is in Colombo. 
When I was reading for my degree, I came across an article by a professor of Economics, whose name escapes me. What he said was that during the time when prices rise, the problem would solve itself because due to the continuously rising prices, people would stop buying those goods. It did not seem to be so in Colombo, but this year, the buying spree was conspicuous by its absence. I was pleased to note that this year, the people of Colombo have learned their lesson the hard way. I must congratulate the people of Colombo for realising it because,the problem of rising prices would solve itself soon . If people refrain from buying too much,the sellers would be compelled to reduce the prices and something that no Government could do, would have been accomplished by the people. It would be another kind of peoples revolt to solve the problem of rising prices. So congratulations to the people of Colombo for the successful revolt! May they revolt more and more, without giving a opportunity to the unscrupulous traders to raise their prices!It is slightly better than going on strike first and negotiating later!

## Title: Common conditions in our urinary system

Common conditions in our urinary system
	

Urology is a branch of medicine which studies disease conditions related to the urinary system-kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. In this article, we will be talking about Cystitis and Pyelonephritis - two common disease conditions about which we get to hear often, how they present, their diagnosis and treatment followed by the features which might be helpful in differentiating one from the other.

What is Cystitis
Cystitis is defined as an infection of the bladder or urethra, most commonly due to a bacterial etiology. Accounting for a significant female predominance possibly due to the short urethra present in females, Cystitis equally affects both males and females.
Bacteria, especially Escherichia coli type, which is a part of the normal flora in the body, sometimes becomes highly virulent, especially in immune-comprised states and invades the walls of the bladder and urethra. They will then get attached to the walls using their pili and multiply resulting in an inflammation and irritation of the wall lining.
The major cause for cystitis to develop in an individual is known to be ascending infections where virulent bacteria enters the target organ through external genitalia.
What are the major risk factors
<U+F06C> Usage of tampons
<U+F06C> Urinary catheterisation
<U+F06C> Pregnant women whose bladder is not emptied completely, most of the time
<U+F06C> Sexually active women
<U+F06C> Urinary tract obstruction
<U+F06C> Usage of diaphragms in women as a method of contraception
<U+F06C> Frequent or vigorous sexual activities
<U+F06C> Menopause
What you would present with, which require medical advice
<U+F06C> Blood mixed urine
<U+F06C> Dark or cloudy urine
<U+F06C> Pain above the pubic bone, lower back or abdomen
<U+F06C> Difficulty in passing urine
<U+F06C> Frequency
<U+F06C> Burning sensation on urination
<U+F06C> High fever (100.4F)
<U+F06C> Irritability in children
<U+F06C> Loss of appetite
<U+F06C> Vomiting
However, some patients may only complain of generalised bodily symptoms such as fatigue, lethargy, nausea, vomiting and feverishness, without any of the features
mentioned above.

What will my doctor do
Your doctor will take a complete history from you about the onset of symptoms and how severely they affect your day-to-day activities along with a thorough abdominal and genital examination which will give important clues towards confirming the diagnosis. However, investigations such as full blood count, urine full report and urine culture are mandatory to confirm the diagnosis.
Also, it is highly necessary to exclude other conditions which might mimic cystitis including, urethritis, sexually transmitted infections, bladder pain syndrome, prostatitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia in men and lower urinary tract infections.
Majority of the patients with this condition will recover on their own within 4 days. However, if your illness is lasting for more than 4 days, it is highly recommended to seek medical advice, without delaying further.

How will I get treated
Antibiotics, depending on the organism is the treatment of choice for Cystitis and until the responsible organism is confirmed with the help of a urine culture, empirical antibiotic therapy will be carried out, covering up all possible bacteria.
Commonly used antibiotics for cystitis include Nitrofurantoin, Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole, Amoxicillin, Cephalosporins, Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin.
Also, it is important to stay appropriately hydrated, so drinking plenty of water is highly encouraged.
Are there any preventive measures
Since prevention is always better than cure, it is important to practice safety methods as much as possible to prevent cystitis, which significantly includes,
<U+F06C> Avoid using perfumed soap, cream or talc powder around genitals.
<U+F06C> Complete emptying the bladder when passing urine.
<U+F06C> Maintain a perfect hydration by drinking plenty of fluids always wiping your bottom from front to back when you go to the toilet
<U+F06C> Emptying the bladder after having sexual intercourse
<U+F06C> Avoid using Diaphragms as a method of contraception

What is Pyelonephritis
Most urinary tract infections involve the bladder and urethra and it is referred to as Pyelonephritis when this damage extends up to the ureters and kidneys.
Generally, a majority of pyelonephritis cases take place as a result of a complication of bladder or urethral infection (E. coli or klebsiella) and can end up in contaminating blood giving rise to fatal scenarios.
This condition can also occur due to a urinary tract obstruction possibly seen in benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), abdominal or pelvic masses and bladder, ureteric or renal calculi.
There are two types of Pyelonephritis as follows:
<U+F06C> Acute - Sudden and self-limiting type which is effectively treated with antibiotics and rarely cause any long-lasting damage to the kidneys.
<U+F06C> Chronic - A rare type which is usually caused by birth defects in the kidney and present as recurrent urinary tract infections particularly in children. This will also result in progressive scarring of the kidneys.
How will I present
<U+F06C> Fever with chills and rigors
<U+F06C> Back pain or flank pain
<U+F06C> Malaise
<U+F06C> Lethargy
<U+F06C> Nausea and vomiting
<U+F06C> Confusion with signs associated with cystitis including, blood in urine, dark or cloudy urine, pain on micturition, increased frequency and urgency of urination.

How will I get diagnosed and treated
A GP will diagnose pyelonephritis with the help of a complete history from the patient followed by an abdominal and pelvic examination. Investigations such as urine full report (to see increased white blood cells and the presence of red blood cells) and urine culture are mandatory to establish the exact diagnosis. Also, it is so important to find the etiology of the condition and therefore, imaging studies like x-ray, ultra sound scan of the pelvis and abdomen (to identify and abscesses, calculi and obstruction), CT and MRI maybe useful.
A blood culture can be useful to identify any possible contamination of blood with the causative bacteria.
It is always advisable to treat pyelonephritis shortly and promptly after making the diagnosis, since there can be immense number of complications if the treatment is delayed or if left untreated. Whether to admit the patient or carry out treatment at home will depend on the severity of the condition and the treatment of choice for pyelonephritis is antibiotics, covering the responsible bacteria.
In a nutshell
<U+F06C> Cystitis is defined as an infection of the bladder or urethra, most commonly due to a bacterial etiology whereas pyelonephritis is a complication of it, caused when the damage extends up to the kidney through ureters.
<U+F06C> Signs and symptoms of both the conditions are quite similar to each other, yet patients with the latter are usually severely ill, requiring hospital admission most of the time.
<U+F06C> Both Cystitis and Pyelonephritis are treated effectively with specific antibiotics, targeting the
causative organism.

## Title: Grim prospect of Kalasarpa Yoga
## Section: Jyotisha News

Grim prospect of Kalasarpa Yoga
	
One observing the planetary line-up these days, would note that it could give rise to the Kalasarpa Yoga whenever the fast moving Moon enters the Rahu  Ketu axis.

How Kalasarpa Yoga is formed
Most students of Astrology may know that the Kalasarpa Yoga is formed whenever all the seven planets are placed between Rahu and Ketu or between Ketu and Rahu. To give a more detailed definition of Kalasarpa Yoga given in a classical work: if in a horoscope all the seven planets are between Rahu and Ketu in relation to any of the Houses, then the yoga thus formed is called Kalasarpa Yoga.

Evil effects
Kalasarpa Yoga is considered a very evil yoga and its effects are: The native will not enjoy mental peace even if he possesses high status, money, power and prosperity. Native may rise to a very high position from a very humble beginning, but he may have to suffer humiliation on account of a penalty imposed by the government.

Redeeming aspects
However, Kalasarpa yoga has its redeeming features. As in the case of Neecha bhanga, Kalasarpa bhanga too gives rise to a very auspicious yoga. Besides, there are a number of planetary combinations that nullifies the Kalasarpa yoga. Further, it has been established through research done by competent astrologers that the very presence of Kalasarpa yoga in a Natal Chart is an indication that the native would attain greatness and prominence in some field. Another positive factor is that Astrology acknowledges human will power is superior to all other powers and man is capable of warding off any pre-determined Karmic effect through the use of his free will.
Among the many famous and successful people in the world known to have had Kalasarpa yoga in their birth charts are Jawaharlal Nehru, Abraham Lincoln, Margaret Thatcher, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Sachin Tendulkar.

Positions of planets in the Zodiac
We know that the planets like Mercury, Mars and Venus that orbit close to the Sun are found in Rashis close to that of the Sun as they are found moving constantly in longitudes close to the Sun. As a matter of fact, we often find both the Sun and Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun, occupying the same sign in a horoscope. However, the distant planets like Jupiter and Saturn are often found moving in Zodiacal signs far away from that of the Sun.

Reason for the formation of Kalasarpa Yoga
However, these days Jupiter and Saturn too are found in longitudes close to that of the Sun. In fact, Saturn is moving these days in Sagittarius in the company of the Sun and Venus only a few degrees apart from one another and Mercury too will join them on January 6 giving rise to Chatur-graha Samyoga or a four planet combination.
Meanwhile, the other distant planet Jupiter is moving in Libra sign along with Mars, close behind the Sun and the other planets in the Zodiacal circle. As for the Moon it is the fastest moving planet in the Zodiacal circle which takes only about 54 hours to traverse one sign in the Zodiac. As a result of the six of the seven planets clustering in signs close to the sign where the Sun is placed, the chances of their falling within the Rahu  Ketu axis have arisen. By the way, these days Rahu is passing through Cancer and Ketu through the Capricorn sign.

Current configuration of planets leading to the formation of Kalasarpa Yoga
Moon which exited from the Rahu  Ketu axis at 20.02 hours on December 20 for the last time will re-enter the axis by beginning its passage in the Leo sign at 03.56 on January 05. So all the seven planets including the Moon will remain hemmed in between Rahu in Cancer and Ketu in Capricorn until Venus moves into Capricorn to be conjunct with Ketu at 14.45 hours on January 13. This means children born between December 20 and January 13 will come under the malefic influence of Kalasarpa Yoga.
However, there are planetary combinations that nullify this Kalasarpa Dosha. Kalasarpa Bhanga Yoga can arise when:
Graha Malika Yoga is present. When planets are placed continuously in five consecutive signs this yoga can occur.
Rahu and Ketu are aspected by or conjoined with their dispositors. (In the present context, Moon and Saturn as Cancer where Rahu is placed is owned by Moon and Capricorn where Ketu is placed is owned by Saturn)
Rahu or Ketu is involved in forming any auspicious yoga
Yogakaraka or yoga forming planets are with Rahu or Ketu.
The 9th House is strong and is aspected by Yogakaraka
Rahu occupies its own Nakshatra (constellation) Ada, Saa or Siyawasa.
The 9th House or the 9th lord is aspected by or associated either with Mars or Saturn.
The Ascendant is owned by Mars or Saturn or these planets influence the Ascendant or its lord
The dispositors of Saturn and Mars are in quadrants from each other or in Dwirdwadasa positions.

Hathurusingha to ban music at cricket training
	
New Sri Lanka cricket coach Chandika Hathurusingha pledged to get tough with the under-performing national team,including banning music in training, while demanding "full control" over selection, the Daily Mail reported today.
Asked about reports that players were admonished for listening to music in practice, Hathurusingha said after his first training session with the team on Thursday: "If they are interested in music they will have to go home."
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera said in June that many players were "too fat" and that none chosen to play a series against Zimbabwe had passed international fitness standards. A special diet was later imposed.
Hathurusingha, a former Sri Lanka batsman who quit as Bangladesh coach to help his home country, also signalled a tougher line with the government, which gets the final say in team affairs.
The chief coach is not an automatic member of the selectors' panel and Hathurusingha wants this changed -- even if it means a new sports law. "I need full control and responsibility to pick the playing eleven," Hathurusingha said.
"According to the sports law the coach can't get involved in selections. They are considering my request to be a selector while being the coach," he said.

How to tame your temper
	

A volcano will soon erupt and those around it are unsure what would happen next. Boom! The volcano erupted burning everything into ashes. Do you know these type of people who erupt like volcanoes Well, thats because they cant control their temper. Let us talk about anger management with Dr. Shavindra Dias, Consultant Psychiatrist and Senior Lecturer of the Psychiatry Department, Facultyof Medicine, Peradeniya University.
Humans have both positive and negative emotions. Positives are joy, happiness, contentment and fulfillment, and the negatives include anger, jealousy and fear. Some people have one of these emotions prominently in their character. For those who are always happy, it is because happiness is prominent among them. Those who are always enraged, have anger as their predominant character. When anger spirals out of control, it is unhealthy as it affects relationships, mentality and health, Dr. Dias said.
Types of anger
Emotional
Physical
Verbal

Anger index
Racing heart
Loud voice
Headache
Breathing faster
Knots in stomach
Dried up throat
Physically attacking something or someone
Anger is like built-up pressure in a tank, which eventually finds a leak and releases the pressure. Anger breaks at one point. Anger is an emotion like happiness, and it is healthy to have some anger. Anger takes an extremely destructive form when it runs out of control. It is totally okay to be angry but within the social norms and social context, Dr. Dias said.

The good
A child cries in anger to have his mothers attention. Eventually, the mother hears the vague cries and runs to her child. Anger is one of the protective mechanisms seen in the behaviour of the animal kingdom. Anger stimulates the fight or flight reaction in animals. A mother will get angry with her son when he doesnt do his homework and her anger will signal the child to do what he is not doing, Dr. Dias said.

The bad
Self harm as a way of letting the anger out is the worst action of all. Secondly, keeping or hiding the anger inside is both physically and mentally harmful. People dont have to be aggressive to express their anger, Dr. Dias said.

Dont hold it
Anger should be well communicated. It is a way of expressing something is threatening or upsetting you. Build the skill of expressing your problem without damaging relationships or your social status. The nervous reaction of anger exists for only two seconds. Therefore, it should be clearly understood that everything after those two seconds is your own thoughts. Practice expressing anger in a harmless manner. Communicating in a respectful way will get others attention. They will listen to you and understand your needs. Some situations tempt you to be aggressive, but dont let others push your button and keep control of how you respond. Do not suppress the feelings of anger but rather understand the message behind and communicate it, Dr. Dias said.
Tips to control your anger
<U+F06C> Go to the washroom and count from 90 to 1 or 10 to 0 slowly.

Some people have a little anger threshold. They often fire compared to others. They have unacceptable expectations, unrealistic goals, foster anger (too much anger) and they are overly decisive, Dr. Dias said.

Effects of anger
Although anger is just an emotion, it has the power over your physical self. Always being high on stress and anger will give you high blood pressure, weaken your immune system, give you diabetics, insomnia and heart attacks. If you are an aggressive character, a huge capacity of your mental energy is spent on anger, and you would be prone to stress, depression and a number of other mental illnesses. Anger will make lasting scars in the memory of your loved ones and gets in the way of personal as well as professional relationships.
Expressing anger comes from the background in which one grew up. When children see shouting parents and elders hitting each other, they pick such behaviour thinking it is how anger is expressed. Therefore, parents must be careful not to fight or argue in front of their children, and train themselves to express anger in a controlled, non-harmful way, Dr. Dias said. 

Do you know
Negative thinking patterns can fuel feelings of anger. Thinking negatively about someone or something, having high expectations and demands from others and failing to accept the reality, jumping into conclusions thinking you know someone else thought badly about you, recollecting small incidents from the past against someone, convincing yourself that he or she is always insane and blaming others when something goes wrong are a few characteristics of a negative thinker who tries to justify his or her actions of anger, according to the internet.

ISIS fighter with American accent urges supporters to take advantage of US gun laws
	
(c) 2017, The Washington Post  Nick Miroff  Dec 28, 2017 - In a video released Wednesday by the Islamic State, a one-legged fighter identified by the group as an American called on Muslims in the United States to take advantage of the countrys gun laws to obtain weapons and carry out attacks.
The fighter, identified as Abu Salih al-Amriki, wears khaki fatigues with a holstered pistol in the online video, which was published by a propaganda wing of the Islamic State. He speaks in English with what sounded like a New York City-area accent.
Take advantage of the fact that you can easily obtain a rifle or a pistol in America, the fighter implored. Spray the kuffar [infidels] with bullets so that their fear of the Muslims rises and they continue to reveal their hatred towards Islam.
The SITE Intelligence Group, a private organization that tracks Islamist militant media, published a copy of the video.

Lines denoting children
	

Vertical lines immediately above the Marriage or Affection line or lines are lines of Children.
They are also called lines of progeny.

Hardly visible
The lines of Children are so thin and faint they are hardly visible to the naked eye. In many cases, it is necessary to use a magnifying glass to discern them. However, often one may see the lines of Children deeply marked in womens hands.

Different types of lines and what they denote
Broad and deep lines of Children indicate sons and weak and thin lines daughters.
Straight lines denote strong and healthy children and faint and crooked lines children in delicate health. A broken line means the death of a child.
If one line stands out clear and distinct among other lines, the child indicated would be more successful in life than others.

Undeveloped Mount of Venus indicates childlessness
A person with an undeveloped Mount of Venus is not likely to have children. This indication is confirmed if the first bracelet is found rising up like an arch towards the palm.

Mano Ganesan provided with STF security
	
Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) leader Minister Mano Ganesan had been provided with Special Task Force (STF) security with a backup vehicle with five STF personnel, STF sources today said.
Meanwhile, the Minister said in a statement that he faced serious security issues and sought the intervention of President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and had also written to the IGP in September.
Certain politicos in Colombo are behind these threats. I have discussed with President Maithripala Sirisena. I have also explained my situation to Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe at different occasions. Some fallen politicians are all out to destroy my party and block the fair representation I seek for the communities my party represents in the city council, he said.
The links between such politicos with underworld elements are visible. Some are connected to white-van saga of the earlier era and drug dealers, he said.
The Minister said he decided to keep his party and candidates away from such threats in Colombo north and added that it was one of the reasons why he decided to contest alone in the forthcoming Municipal Council elections in Colombo
I have also written to the IGP as early as September. The Police had already been notified. The threat level has increased due to the election heat, he said.
Certain websites are printing falsehood that President Sirisena ordered STF Security for me in exchange for political support of my party to his party. To be fair to the President, he did not discuss party and election politics with me. He acted with responsibility and authority in the security interest of his Cabinet member.
Besides I am not a person who makes my decision for perks. I have a very long clean history of principled politics. Such reports have been cooked in Colombo and fed from here, he said.
There had been shooting incidents during last Parliamentary elections campaign in the Colombo north. Lately, there was a shooting incident occurred two weeks before at Modera in Colombo north. There had been reports coming from election monitors on the inclusion of underworld elements in the nomination lists.
The Chairman of Elections Commission too had made comments on this issue, he further said in a statement.
I have neither armed gangs nor underworld elements working for me. Therefore when I face threats, I have no alternative but to seek Governmental protection. I am part of the Government. My security concern is not political but logical. It is my right too. On the other hand, my Cabinet colleagues Rajitha Senaratne, Rishad Bathiudeen, Palani Thigambaram, Rauff Hakeem are also provided with STF security, he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)

DOUMA AFP Dec28, 2017- A second batch of sick Syrian civilians, most of them children, left the besieged rebel enclave of Eastern Ghouta, aid officials said Thursday, but hundreds of critical patients remained trapped. 
Four evacuations took place on Tuesday and another group of 12 made it out late Wednesday, but a top humanitarian envoy questioned a deal under which medical emergencies are used as bargaining chips. A total of 29 emergency medical cases are expected to be evacuated under a deal with the government that saw rebels release 26 individuals, including workers detained during fierce clashes with the army in March. The numbers are still a far cry from the nearly 500 patients in the Damascus suburb the UN said weeks ago would die if they did not urgently receive better treatment.

Therefore, we recommend that people should have six teaspoons of sugar per day because of the fact that all food contain some amount of sugar.

NDB delights children with surprise Santa
	
A childs greatest wish during the festive season is to see the famed Santa Clause bring gifts, and NDB made that wish come true.
During the Christmas week, NDB - accompanied by Santa Clause - made home visits to over 500 children, island wide, surprising them with gifts.
The bank taking yet another step forward towards fulfilling the demands of their young customers brought Santa right to their doorstep during the Christmas season.
During the NDB Santa promotion, parents deposited Rs.50,000 or more to their childs NBD Childrens Savings account before December 15th, and selected a gift to be delivered to their child. The gifts ranged from scooters to melodicas and remote-controlled helicopters. Santa hand-delivered the selected gift to the child from December 21st to 24th.
The response to the NDB Santa promotion was immediate and islandwide, where accounts were opened from the Northern Province to the Southern. NDBs Santa visited a number of areas like Anuradhapura, Jaffna, Mahiyanganaya, Ampara, Hambantota and Colombo. The response from Kandy, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya and Kuliyapitiya was also significant.
One child, accepting the gift, said: I have always wanted to see Santa Clause and NDB made that wish come true!
NDB continuously strives to instill the joy of saving in the young generation. NDB Childrens Savings is specifically designed to cater to each parents unique needs while making savings more rewarding and exciting for the children at the same time.
During the promotion period, parents from all walks of life expressed their happiness at the simple delight NDB brought to their children.
When we heard about the offer, we immediately went and deposited the money. Saving for the long term is often tedious for little children, but NDB makes it interesting and children are more enthusiastic about saving, a parent said.
The salient feature of the Childrens Savings is the fun of receiving valuable gifts for the children whilst the account balance grows with a comprehensive savings plan. It is carefully designed in a way that the savings will prosper and reward the children and will also be entitled to substantial benefits for important milestones they achieve along the way.

Not all children  refuse school  due to sheer laziness
	

It is no secret that weve all pretended to suffer from headaches and stomachaches when we were little, just so we could bunk school. This habit, however, never became a continuous practice. But are you aware that there do exist several children who have such an aversion towards schooling that it is almost as if they have a phobia towards school and what it represents. This is indeed a very frustrating event for a parent and no doubt would adversely impact the childs education as well as his or her social and emotional development. But have you, as a parent, thought about the root cause for this behaviour Can there be a more serious pathology underlying their continuous refusal to attend school, other than the need to stay at home and laze around
This week, Health Capsule consulted Dr. Udena Attygalle, Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, to study this subject.

How do they present
Refusal to go to school is not a diagnosis but a presentation. Children give various excuses and explanations to bunk school. This is not an illness. This could happen due to many reasons. The condition is commoner in the society than we think it is, Dr. Attygalle said.
Complaints over various symptoms such as abdominal pain or headache cease to exist the very moment we allow the child to stay at home. Crying in the classroom, wanting to go home, frequently complaining about the school and absenteeism on days when an assignment or speech is due, are several ways a child with school phobia can present.

Underlying reasons
Despite the opinion of a majority of parents that their child is refusing to school out of sheer laziness, there may be many other underlying reasons for this nature. According to Dr. Attygalle, these reasons may originate in school, at home, while commuting or may just be the temperament of the child.
A problem in the school environment like bullies or strict teachers can be the precipitating factor, but there may be more serious complications such as an underlying learning disorder like Dyslexia or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.
A child who has separation anxiety may refuse to go to school for the fear of being separated from his or her family and the environment. In other cases, problems at home, a sick parent or financial constraints may want a child to keep away from school.
At times, this condition neither relates to home nor school environment, but another source. For instance, being bullied in school or on their way home. In such a scenario, the child will agree to go to school if the parent drop them.
In some cases, this condition is not caused by the outside environment, but due to the childs temperament. For instance, if two children get scolded by the same teacher for not doing their homework, one of them may take it in stride while the other will be anxious and depressed, wanting to bunk classes to avoid any such repetition. There are also a few children who simply prefer to stay at home without any particular reason. In most of the cases, it is not just one of these causes but a combination of them that presents a childs refusal to go to school, Dr. Attygalle said.

How should parents approach the child
The main advantage parents have in dealing with this condition is the bond between them and their child. This helps in recognising the presentation early and the child is more likely to reveal the cause for his or her refusal to go to school. For this, the child should feel that the parents are accessible and emotionally available.
According to Dr. Attygalle, the most important thing is to find the root cause. To figure out why the child is refusing to go to school. This should be done in a manner that does not stress out the child further. Finding solutions for those problems have much long-term results than forcefully sending the child to school.
A parent should be very delicate when handling the situation as parental involvement may aggravate the problem than resolving it. For instance, if the parents find out that their child is being bullied in school, they should never confront the bully or bullies as the child may face the risk of being rejected or further humiliated by his peers. The approach differs from child to child. It may depend on their age, the severity of the underlying issue and the child him/herself, Dr. Attygalle said.
If parents find it difficult to get the child to open up about the issues he or she faces, they are advised to seek professional help before it is too late.
Refusal to go to school should be dealt with as early as possible. The longer the child stays away from school, the further he or she lags behind. This may also contribute to other issues like fear of exclusion from friends, Dr. Attygalle said.

Is our education system responsible for this condition
Yes, at least partly. Even though we cannot blame the education system entirely, its fiercely competitive nature that gives a child little or no chance to make mistakes and learn from them definitely contributes to this condition. Hence, we as a society must ensure a peaceful learning atmosphere in schools when dealing with children, Dr. Attygalle said.

Psoriasis: A condition causing scaling skin
	

Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition where there is an abnormal turnover of epidermal cells. Although it doesnt affect many people, those inflicted by it have to deal with the discomfort of having their skin shedding process accelerated.
Speaking to Dr. Nayani Madarasinghe, Consultant Dermatologist, Health Capsule learnt that although there is no cure for psoriasis, it is treatable. The skin condition is not contagious and people who suffer from it can go about their normal lives. No dietary changes need to be made regarding psoriasis and the fertility of a person who suffers from it is not affected. Someone with psoriasis can get married, have children and lead a normal life. Treatment only needs to be done when the psoriasis is exhibited.

What is Psoriasis
Dr. Madarasinghe explained the process of skin shedding and then moved on to explain how the skin condition changes it.
Usually, in the epidermis of the skin, there are different cell layers. The lowermost layer will proliferate and then cells move upwards. When they move upwards, the cells reshape and lose viability, thus becoming dead cells which will then shed out. This is what usually happens. It takes about 28 days for the cells to go to the topmost layer and then to shed out. But in psoriasis, which is a non-contagious inflammatory skin condition, there is an abnormal turnover of epidermal cells. With psoriasis, this process is accelerated. Now, in a normal person, we dont see dead cells shedding off, but it happens so fast and aggressively that you can see the dead cells accumulate on the surface and form a scaly skin and will shed more. This is however a result of irregular activity in the body. Not everyone gets it, Dr. Madarasinghe said.

Types
Dr. Madarasinghe explained the varieties of psoriasis and how it occurs.
One is chronic psoriasis. It happens when the skin condition has been there for some time. Sometimes it can only involve the palms and soles of the feet. At times, it can involve the scalp only. In some other instances, the entire body can be involved and although you dont see the specific lesions, the body can turn red, inflame and be scaling. Sometimes you see a different variety where you get small pustules, yellow-coloured pus filled blisters. This is known as pustule psoriasis, Dr. Madarasinghe said.

Signs and aggravating factors
You get thick patches on your skin which are lesions. They could be red and have very thick adhered scales. The most common places are the knees, elbows and back of the ear. Sometimes it can only be on the scalp.
Some people will have nail changes. You get small pits in the nail and they get discoloured and lose connection with the nail bed. Factors aggravating the condition include alcohol consumption, smoking, stress, several drugs and infections.
Some people with skin psoriasis can also have affected joints. So they can get arthritis. Also, psoriasis is known to be an independent risk factor. People with psoriasis are known to have obesity and cardio vascular diseases, Dr. Madarasinghe said.

Treatment
According to Dr. Madarasinghe, there is no cure for psoriasis, but it can be managed.
There are treatments available depending on the severity. Sometimes we give UV treatment, oral drugs and even injections. People dont have to be on treatment for a long time. When they get an episode, it can be treated. Only a minority of people with psoriasis will have to be on medication for lifelong, Dr. Madarasinghe said.

Query about pay hike flung egg on his face
	

A story is abuzz in political circles about how a Diyawanna politico had to suffer much humiliation when he made an inquiry about a possible pay increase to them.

According to a practice now being followed, whenever there is an upward revision of the salary scales of the members of the judiciary, a corresponding pay hike is granted to all law makers as well. This Diyawanna politico too had heard about the proposed pay revision for the judicial officers and at the conclusion of a high level conference held recently, he had asked a high political authority, Sir, are we too getting a hike
The answer he had got had been something he hardly expected. I say, do some work for the good of the people who elected you before talking about a pay increaseCome to think of it, what we should do is to impose a pay cut, not give you an increase!
The politico who lost face in the presence of a big gathering had looked stunned and later quietly made his exit, they say.

Rohingya at risk of deadly diphtheria face shortage of medics, antitoxins
	

Bangladesh, (REUTERS) 28 Dec- Health workers in Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh are struggling with a shortage of medics able to administer antitoxins to patients infected with diphtheria that has killed nearly two dozen people, aid officials said. 
More than 650,000 Rohingya have fled mainly Buddhist Myanmar to Bangladesh since August, on top of more than 200,000 who fled earlier, according to latest United Nations data. 
Doctors Without Borders (MSF), the lead agency dealing with an outbreak of the bacterial disease in camps sheltering the Rohingya, has treated around 2,000 patients in the past few weeks and is receiving around 100 new cases daily. 
The World Health Organisation (WHO) describes diphtheria as a widespread, severe infectious disease with epidemic potential and a mortality rate of up to 10 percent. MSF has called diphtheria a disease long forgotten in most parts of the world thanks to increasing rates of vaccination. 
MSF has managed to provide antitoxins to only around 12 patients daily due to the lack of trained medics, said Crystal van Leeuwen, an MSF emergency medical coordinator now in Coxs Bazar where the refugee camps are located. The British government said on Thursday it was sending a team of more than 40 doctors, nurses and firefighters to Coxs Bazar for six weeks to deal with the diphtheria outbreak following a request by the WHO and Bangladesh government.

Srinivasa Ramanujan: Mathematical genius and the supernatural
	
Prof. G.H. Hardy of the Cambridge University went to Putney by a taxi to see his student who fell ill. While they were chatting, Hardy mentioned the number of the taxi he came in  1729  which seemed to be a dull number to him. No, the student suddenly replied, it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways. Hardy was impressed and it later came to be known in the mathematical world as the Hardy-Ramanujan number.
Does knowledge derive from scientific reasoning only
Professor G.H. Hardy was one of the greatest mathematicians in the 20th century. But who was that extraordinary student who amazed him It was he who had each integer as his personal friend, the man who knew infinity - Srinivasa Ramanujan.
Srinivasa Ramanujan was a prestigious Indian mathematician. A film based on his life story was released in 2015 titled The man who knew infinity. (The movie was based on a more interesting book on him by the same name written by Robert Kanigel.)
According to the movie, Ramanujan grew up in Madras in British India in abject poverty. It marked 130 years this month since the birth of Ramanujan on December 22, 1887. He went to the village Kovil and stayed there for long hours doing his own mathematical research. He was jobless. He went everywhere in Madras showing his books to everyone in order to find a job and to find a person who could understand his work. But he found neither. Everyone asked for recommendations. Then, he met Mr. Narayana, who was fascinated by Ramanujans work and offered Ramanujan his own job as a clerk in the accounts department of his office. Narayana noticed that Ramanujan never used the abacus (at that time the abacus was the calculating machine). His mental calculations were faster than the abacus. Mr. Narayanas idea was that Ramanujan should show his work to British mathematicians. Therefore, Ramanujan wrote to H.F. Baker and G.H. Hardy. However, the former neglected the letter.
One day, while Prof. Hardy was in his room at Trinity College, University of Cambridge, his servant came to him with a letter which had come from very far. Hardy initially thought the letter was a hoax as it was from a Hindu clerk who worked in an accounts department, but had given meaning to negative values of the gamma function. Hardy was sure it was from a fellow mathematician, J.E. Littlewood. Hardy was flabbergasted when Littlewood rejected this and read the letter carefully as it was full of theorems. Some are known and some are new. He concluded that this should be real because no one would have had the imagination to create such complex patterns otherwise. Prof. Littlewood also read this letter and was amazed. However no proofs were included. Thereafter, they invited Ramanujan to Cambridge as a student in spite of the objections of some other lecturers.
Ramanujan who was married soon after he had the job refused to go to England at first since Brahmins were forbidden to cross the sea by Hindu tradition (Ramanujan was a Brahmin). Later, he changed his mind and went to England. In England, he had a hard time being a vegetarian. In Cambridge, Hardy and Ramanujan started their cooperative work. Hardy also had a hard time persuading Ramanujan that proofs are necessary. What Hardy needed were proofs. What Ramanujan couldnt understand was why Western mathematicians were wasting their time for step by step deductions while the answer is already in hand. What he wanted was to publish his theorems. This clash of opinions was seen throughout their journey. At last, Hardy shared the burden of proving Ramanujans work and they published some papers together.
While these developments were taking place in the calm atmosphere of Cambridge, violence flared up in distant parts of Europe. The World War I, as we name it now was taking shape. Not a single person could escape the impact of the war. Many people of Cambridge went to the front line. Professor Littlewood was also among them. Professor Hardy was involved in the peace movement by Bertrand Russell. Ramanujan had a hard time too. Being a vegetarian in England at that time was necessarily difficult. The film depicts a bombardment on Cambridge also. At that time, Hardy revealed to Ramanujan that Littlewood had found Ramanujans prime number conjecture to be false. Hardy used this moment to persuade Ramanujan that proofs were essential. He said intuition only does not give a proper picture. Ramanujan was in for a shock when he heard all this. However, after that he acquired some rigor in his work. Next time Ramanujan conjectured a new statement on partition function. Hardy and Ramanujan studied it further and published.
Ramanujans health was not good at all. He had a severe bout of tuberculosis. But he did not stop his work. Hardy thought Ramanujan should be offered the fellowship of Trinity College of Cambridge. But the proposal was refused because he was Indian. Then Hardy requested the Royal Society to offer Ramanujan a fellowship. They accepted it and Ramanujan became a fellow of Royal Society (as the second Indian Fellow). Thereafter, Trinity College offered him a fellowship too. Ramanujan had the last laugh. He was the first Indian fellow of Trinity College.
Ramanujans answer to this question was something Hardy never expected. Ramanujan had acquired knowledge through Goddess Namagiri (a version of Goddess Kali)
What amazed Prof. Hardy the most was how Ramanujan did all these things. Though he had put it to intuition, he felt that mere intuition is not enough for such complex mathematical theorems. Ramanujans answer to this question was something Hardy never expected. Ramanujan had acquired knowledge through Goddess Namagiri (a version of Goddess Kali). Namagiri would speak to him and offer him equations when he was in bed or saying prayers, Ramanujan would say. She was the source of knowledge in Ramanujan. It was very difficult for Hardy to accept this as an atheist.
An equation for me has no meaning, Ramanujan once said, unless it expresses a thought of God.
Finally Ramanujan went back to India, where his sickness became severe and the angel of death solved the equation of his life too early. Ramanujans final notebook was found later and its calculations were used to analyse the characteristics of black holes later.
My above description of Ramanujan is based on the movie. There is a little tension between the film and the actual life story. For instance, Ramanujan had published some of his work in the Indian Mathematics Journal and had some appraisers even before he went to Britain. The way he learned mathematics in his early life was not depicted in the film. The film though contains many famous sayings of Ramanujan, Russell and Hardy. For instance, Hardy once told Russell: If I could prove by logic that you would die in five minutes, I should be sorry you were going to die, but my sorrow would be very much mitigated by the pleasure in the proof.
The story of Ramanujan inspires us to rethink about our ideas on the supernatural and religiosity. In contemporary society, religion is commonly labelled as a backward force. People try to pretend they disbelieve in religion and supernatural phenomena to maintain their social status. Educated people who follow a religious life tend to only take it as a rational practice, excluding all social and spiritual aspects of it. Superstitions, astrology and occult practices have been totally rejected from educated society. People who dabble with those ideas are portrayed as fools by the educated. When the famous Arsenic experiment was done by Dr. Nalin de Silva and the team some years back, educated people tried to reject the results by poking fun at God Natha.
However, the story of Ramanujan urges us to think otherwise. This great mathematician, Ramanujan, (uneducated by common educational standards) asks all those educated people to respect folk wisdom.
Summing up, I recall a story of another great scientific mind in the last century - Niels Bohr, one of the scientists who initiated quantum mechanics. He usually kept a horseshoe on his table while teaching. The horseshoe in Western culture is a symbol of luck. A student asked, Sir, do educated people like you also believe in these horseshoe things
Bohr retorted at once, I dont think the horseshoe will be concerned whether you believe it or not.

Suicide bombers  kill dozens  at Shiite centre in Afghan capital
	

Suicide bombers stormed a Shiite cultural centre and news agency in the Afghan capital on Thursday, killing more than 40 people and wounding scores, many of them students attending a conference. 
Islamic State said in an online statement that it was responsible for the attack, the latest in a series the movement has claimed on Shiite targets in Kabul. 
Waheed Majrooh, a Spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, said 41 people, including four women and two children, had been killed and 84 wounded, most suffering from burns. 
The attack occurred during a morning panel discussion on the anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Sunni-majority Afghanistan at the Tabian Social and Cultural Centre, witnesses said. 
The floors of the centre, at the basement level, were covered in blood as wailing survivors and relatives picked through the debri. Deputy Health Minister Feda Mohammad Paikan said 35 bodies had been brought into the nearby Istiqlal hospital. Television pictures showed many of the injured suffered serious burns. 
The bloodshed followed an attack on a private television station in Kabul last month, which was also claimed by the local affiliate of Islamic State. 
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement on Twitter denying involvement in the attack. 
Over the past two years, Islamic State in Khorasan, as the local group is known, has claimed a growing number of attacks on Shiite targets in Afghanistan, where sectarian attacks were previously rare.

The year at large
	
Maithripala Sirisena. Ranil Wickremesinghe. Mahinda Rajapaksa. Commissions and commissions. Interparty rivalries. Intraparty rivalries. Floods. Droughts. Cyclones. Donald Trump. Jerusalem. Russia. What will 2017 be most remembered for in Sri Lanka Not too difficult to answer, but thats only if you have your preferences towards what you deem to be more newsworthy than everything else. For me, hence, it was none of the above. Rather, the most newsworthy phenomenon that transpired this past year, to me, which made it into big column headlines just below the masthead and later congealed intermittently into the fourth or fifth page as a small news item, was the conflict between the public and private sphere. A broad category, yes, but in that category and conflict we see how the entirety of 2017, here, was spent.
We are a resilient nation only because we tend to forget, as time passes by, the ills we suffered in the not-too-distant past. That conflict between the public and the private hence endures, in the form of not just strikes and demonstrations but also, more pertinently, the levelling and elevation of our consciousness of what entails the public and the private in the first place. The conflict between the two, this year, involved several issues, some pertinent, others not so: medical standards (SAITM), the sale of the Hambantota Port to China (the Petroleum Corporation), the granting of equitable pay rises (the Railways Department), the abolishment of what was alleged to be a fraudulent pay hike made to top level managers and engineers (the Electricity Board). In each case we had demonstrations that directly affected the public: no government doctors at government hospitals, no drivers operating our trains, no petrol for your car, and no technical staff for local power outages. As far as strikes go, borrowing an oft-quoted phrase, this was one heck of a year, for the people and for the strikers.

41 strikes with a loss of more than 104,000 man days (I am quoting Namini Wijedasa) may seem like a lot but thats mainly owing to the fact that we havent come across a country and polity ailed with so many demonstrations and such a level of sustained trade union action. Its interesting to note that this in itself is an indication of the way the government operates, since regardless of the many manifest faults within the public sector (the inefficiencies, the delays in getting work done, the disjuncture between rhetoric and action throughout the year, especially with respect to disaster management), it appears to have softened in the face of demonstrations. Again I quote Namini Wijedasa: from 2013 to 2014, right before Mahinda Rajapaksa was ousted, the number of man days (in the private sector) dropped by more than 53 percent. Lets face it: all other things considered, trade union action is dependent on how the government of the day reacts to it. And 2017, in that sense, was the worst in a decade.
One can lament. One can brighten up. I prefer to brighten up. Not because I havent been inconvenienced by these demonstrations, not because as a member of the public I dont deplore the fact that others who were busier than me were inconvenienced in more insidious ways (think of the fuel strike, which lasted unbelievably for almost five days), but because in this spate of trade union protests we see a thawing of the ice, a veritable melting away of the veneer of complacency and public apathy that was maintained by the previous regime. The Electricity Board strike, which initially lasted for 48 hours (in April), then ballooned into the longest of its sort conducted here this year (a week in September) and almost ballooned into another, probably longer strike that would have crippled this festive season, was for me a good indication of that: it was all about doing away with allegedly unfair and illegal pay rises granted to top level engineers during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime. That it took all this time for it to surface, for the workers to revolt against those rises, tells us all that we need to know about inexorable tensions in the public sector that are fermented, nurtured, and pushed up eventually despite the most complacent and authoritarian of governments.
But this spate of trade unionism is in itself not a cause for complacency. Lets not forget that union action is a direct, if not indirect, consequence of government apathy. Apathy is the product of complacency, and is generally understood to result in delays and inefficiencies and hostilities with respect to demonstrations and protests. Such delays, inefficiencies, and hostilities can in the long-term be bottled up to such an extent that what ultimately comes out is a picket republic: a nation of protestors on the one hand and of those who wield the baton against those protestors on the other. This dichotomy, between the public and the private, is dangerous if sustained beyond a certain degree and period, particularly since unresolved pressures and conflicts tend to get pushed up, terribly, until all thats left is a shattered, bruised polity. Its that bruised polity which left more than 100,000 people dead and maimed in the eighties. So clearly, union action is a welcome first step to force the government, any government, to open its eyes, but theres no use in that if the government still prefers to be blind to everything except certain vested interests from the private sphere.
The identification of a certain movement with a certain individual is not the preserve of trade union or public sector action but this year proved, to a considerable extent, how the conflation of the movement with the individual could be made and sustained
The identification of a certain movement with a certain individual is not the preserve of trade union or public sector action but this year proved, to a considerable extent, how the conflation of the movement with the individual could be made and sustained: Lahiru Weerasekara with the student protests against SAITM, the top board of the GMOA with the institutional protests against anomalies in the national health sector, and Ranjan Jayalal with the Electricity Board strike. Names matter and so do protestors, so I wonder: will these individuals take forward the unresolved issues, the unaddressed elephants in the room (the SAITM problem has not been solved to the complete satisfaction of the demonstrators, while the Electricity Board anomaly is still in the pipeline), to the next year, and if so, will expect more power outages, more vacant government hospitals, more vacant University Medical Faculties. Perhaps. That, however, is not really cause for regret, or lament, rather cause for reflection.
So what is there to reflect on with respect to all these vignette-like observations Simply, that in 2017 we saw the most newsworthy political phenomenon since the rise of dissent from within the SLFP in 2014 and 2015: the rise of dissent, pressured in and held back for so long, in fact for more than a decade, from the key representatives and institutions affiliated with our national public sphere. Thats important, and it ought to compel, not emotional hysterics, but careful scrutiny, today and tomorrow.

Trump legal team readies attack on Flynns credibility
	

By Carol D. Leonnig The Washington Post, 27 December - President Trumps legal team plans to cast former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn as a liar seeking to protect himself if he accuses the president or his senior aides of any wrongdoing, according to three people familiar with the strategy.
 
The approach would mark a sharp break from Trumps previously sympathetic posture toward Flynn, whom he called a wonderful man when Flynn was ousted from the White House in February. Earlier this month, the president did not rule out a possible pardon for Flynn, who is cooperating with special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. 
Attorneys for Trump and his top advisers have privately expressed confidence that Flynn does not have any evidence that could implicate the president or his White House team.

US GSP: Govt. says no significant impact
	
The discontinuing of the GSP programme by the US from next year to 120 countries including Sri Lanka would not make a significant impact on the exports to the US, the Government said today.
National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva said people seemed to be confused with the US GSP and Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) Plus given by the European Union (EU).
The US GSP applies to 120 countries and there is nothing special or significant to Sri Lanka. Once it was removed, the cost of exports will rise only by about 3% in tariff.
Sri Lankas total exports to the US was USD 2.8 billion in 2016. Only USD 173 million exports, which amounted to 6.2% of the total, received the GSP.
The number of textile exports was only 1% which amounted to USD 27 million. Any person can realise that this has no significant impact on our exports to the US, he told a news briefing.
He said rubber based products, which were exported to the US enjoyed the GSP benefits largely.
However, USD 173 million worth of exports which received GSP benefit is not a big amount of our total exports of about USD 11,000 million. This will make a negligible impact, he said.
He said the EU GSP plus was more important than US GSP as only nine countries including Sri Lanka harvest the benefits of the GSP plus when exporting goods to 28 European countries.
The GSP plus tariff concessions span from 10-20% which is a considerable reduction in tariff. Our exports to the EU stand at USD 3.1billion in 2016 and over USD 2 billion worth of exports were textiles. We are able to and continue to benefit from the GSP plus. Due to GSP plus, 47% of our fish exports had increased recently. Therefore it is very vital, Dr. De Silva said.
He said that all 120 countries which received the GSP will have to pay 3% increase in tariff from next year.
This is not significant as the 10-20% tariff reduction we receive from the GSP plus, he reiterated.
The deputy minister refused reports which say the concession was not renewed because of the UN vote over Jerusalem, in which President Donald Trumps decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israels capital was defied.
The GSP has been removed for all 120 countries including the countries which abstained the UN vote and even those who voted alongside the US. The reports are unfounded, he said.
He also said there was no need to go for State-level discussions with the US over GSP as its a policy based decision of that country. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Why is treating worm infection vital
	

Worm infections are extremely common in children and spread easily. These parasitic organisms live and feed off the living host. Apart from the irritation that occurs because of infection, most of them are usually asymptomatic. White worms are usually visible in an infected childs anal area and the childs stool. 
Health Capsule got in touch with Dr. Kosala Karunaratne, Consulting Pediatrician of Lady Ridgeway Hospital Colombo, in order to shed light upon the topic. 
There are many types of worms that infest the bowels of people, such as pinworms, hookworms, roundworms and so forth. Pinworms are tiny, narrow worms and such infection is one of the most common types of human intestinal worm infections. This infection is spread by person to person by ingesting pinworm eggs that have contaminated hands, bedsheets, clothing and other items. Pinworm eggs can live on household surfaces for over two weeks, especially in cool, humid areas such as bathrooms. When a child or adult has been infected with pinworms, the entire family has the risk of contracting it. Hence, all family members will have to be treated at once.
Human beings contract hookworms through eggs and larvae found in dirt, contaminated by faeces. Hookworms are also known to causing blood loss which ultimately leads to anemia. They are an intestinal parasite that causes intestinal disease. 
Roundworms are the largest worms measuring up to 5-6 inches. They live inside human gut and infect the small intestine which can ultimately cause human intestines to be obstructed. Most of these infections are contracted by coming into contact with contaminated soil, but tapeworm infections on the other hand are contracted through undercooked pork, fish and meat, Dr. Karunaratne said. 

Steps that could be followed to avoid worm infections
General cleanliness is of utmost importance when it comes to preventing worm infection. These infections are contracted through soil which is contaminated by faeces. If you make sure to wash your hands well before preparing food and after using the washroom, the chances of contracting these infections can be reduced. Thoroughly cooking your food too minimises the chances of contracting these infections. 
Also, trimming your childs nails and making sure they have fresh and dry clothes on keep infections at bay. Teaching them good health habits such as cleaning their hands after passing stool and making sure they wash up before and after meals could be of immense importance too, Dr. Karunaratne said. 
Treating worm infections as quickly as possible is extremely important because these infections are contagious and the wise move is to treat worm infections as soon as symptoms appear.
How can you tell if your child has a worm infection
Fever 
	Blood in your stool 
	Loss of appetite 
	Itchy rashes 
	Irritability among infants

Yellow fever: A not so colourful disease
	

While Dengue plagues the people in the Asian region, yellow fever has become Dengues partner in crime, severely affecting the health of those living in the African region. Though it is true that yellow fever is not prevalent in Sri Lanka, Health Capsule is ever ready to endow you with knowledge. In this weeks edition, Prof. Arjuna De Silva, Faculty of Medicine, Ragama, speaks on yellow fever.
Yellow fever is a mosquito borne virus that affects the bodys organs, mainly the liver. The non-communicable disease is transmitted by an infected mosquito carrying the virus. The disease shows three phases: infection, remission and intoxication. The condition shares many similarities with Dengue. The symptoms displayed by a patient suffering from yellow fever are just like Dengue symptoms, Prof. De Silva accentuated.

Turning yellow
During the infection phase of yellow fever, a patient may experience headache, fever, muscle and joint aches and vomiting, similar to the case of Dengue.
These symptoms including fever disappear during the remission phase. And during the intoxication phase, most of the bodys organs may malfunction due to damages caused by the disease. The heart, liver and kidney are some main organs that will be influenced adversely.
The characteristic symptom of yellow fever is jaundice. Due to the malfunctioning of the liver, there will be a buildup in a yellow pigment known as bilirubin in the body. Worn out red blood cells are destroyed by the liver. The breakdown of these cells result in the creation of bilirubin. Due to impairment in the livers metabolism, there will be an accumulation of bilirubin which causes the skin and white parts of a patients eyes to turn yellow, Prof. De Silva said.

A blood testsays it all
Yellow fever is diagnosed through blood and antibody tests, Prof. De Silva said. When a patient contracts these symptoms, a blood test can confirm the condition so that immediate treatment can be taken.How to overcome the yellow fever challenge
Similar to Dengue, yellow fever has to be treated on time. Otherwise complications may develop and even lead to fatality, Prof. De Silva said.
A person can recover with treatment and rest. So medical care and bed rest are key factors of treatment. Prof. De Silva said the treatment includes a yellow fever vaccine. This vaccine is available in Sri Lanka too. Just like Dengue, there is no particular cure for yellow fever. A patient may recover with time. The positive point of yellow fever over Dengue is that there is a proper vaccine against the disease.

Vaccination is key
The probability of contracting yellow fever in the island is quite nil in Sri Lanka. However, you are under the high risk of yellow fever if you are planning to visit the African region. Therefore, it is strongly advised to get the yellow fever vaccine before migrating to regions where yellow fever is prevalent.
