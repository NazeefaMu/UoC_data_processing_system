DFCC Bank secures loan from Middle-East to fuel offshore expansion plans
	
DFCC Bank has successfully raised funds in the Middle East on the strength of its credentials and sound track record established over a period of 61 years. Witnessing growth across all its sectors, DFCC Bank has evolved into a technology-backed modern commercial bank that meets the aspirations of both its commercial and development clients.?
This loan will provide the right springboard for the dynamic bank to strengthen its offshore presence while tapping into new markets. The bank has been an innovator in the industry and this infusion of capital will help to fuel its long-term expansion plans.
?A three-year US dollar term loan facility has been secured by DFCC Bank from National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah (RAKBANK) of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Alpen Capital (ME) Limited, an investment banking advisory firm, also UAE-based, acted as the sole financial advisor to the transaction.
DFCC Bank secured the loan for general expansion of its offshore banking unit (FCBU) and the loan facility was signed in Dubai, UAE, recently. Attending the ceremony were RAKBANK CEO Peter England, DFCC Bank Deputy CEO Lakshman Silva, RAKBANK MD Wholesale Banking Rahul Oberoi and DFCC Bank Senior Vice President Treasury and Resource Mobilisation Kapila Nanayakkara, along with senior representatives from RAKBANK and Alpen Capital.
Commenting on this significant achievement, Silva said, ?DFCC is delighted to announce that it has successfully mobilised funding in the overseas market of the Middle East, by securing a significant US dollar loan facility from RAKBANK.?
We have strong aspirations to grow our offshore banking business and we believe these funds will provide the right leverage to power our growth plans and support our expansion strategy. Our ability to raise long-term funding on this scale from a reputed overseas financial institution reflects investor confidence in DFCC Bank?s operations and in its future growth potential.?
This long-term funding is also an encouraging sign for the local banking industry as a whole, as it reinforces faith in the industry prospects and in the trajectory of the national economy. This is our first foray into the Middle Eastern market for medium to long-term financing and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Alpen Capital for assisting us in diversifying our funding mix through their relationships with Middle Eastern banks.?

ETCA to be signed end of this year: Ranil
	
India and Sri Lanka will sign the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) by the end of this year, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today as both countries look to cement ties further.
Addressing the India Economic Summit organized by the World Economic Forum (WEF), Wikremesinghe said, ?We are cognizant that the economic asymmetry between Sri Lanka and India will increase in the future when the latter emerges as a major global player in an increasingly multipolar world. The India-Sri Lanka FTA (Free Trade Agreement) will be further expanded and deepened to go beyond trading goods to cover trade in services, investments and technology cooperation.?
?The proposed economic and technology cooperation agreement will be signed by end of this year?Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi and I decided that we should conclude it by this year,? he added.
He pointed out that the economic and technology cooperation agreement offers a strategic economic advantage to Sri Lanka and the fast-growing southern Indian states. ?These five southern states have a population of 250 million and a combined GDP of $450 billion. With an addition of Sri Lanka $80 billion, the GDP in this sub regional economy will cross $500 billion,? he said.
He added that along with the free trade agreement between Sri Lanka and Singapore, the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) between India and Singapore and the ETCA between India and Sri Lanka will establish a tripartite agreement for trade and investments.
Wickremesinghe, who is on a three-day visit to India, said he also floated the idea in a meeting with Modi of getting countries like Indonesia and Malaysia and BIMSTEC (The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) countries to be a part of the larger economic partnership.
He also downplayed fears of Sri Lanka?s military ties with China around investments in the one belt one road programme that envisages massive Chinese investments in infrastructure building in the island nation. ?There has been a lot of suspicion that there is a military element to it. But that is not there. We have told this very clearly to the Chinese and they have agreed,? he said. (Livemint.com)

Organised under the banner of ?Arunalu? ? the bank?s flagship children?s savings account, this was the fifth occasion that Sri Lanka?s largest private bank supported an event of this nature to engage with children and adults on a day universally dedicated to children.

India, Pakistan should find a way of working together: SL
	
Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama, who is in India on an official visit, advocated the need for India and Pakistan to find a way of working together if SAARC is keen to create regional economic population, PTI reported today.
Stating that SAARC accounts for just 5 per cent of the total trade of the member countries, the minister said barriers like high cost of trading in the region and absence of regional value chain have hindered growth of economic co-operation.
?The fact is it is natural for neighbouring countries to trade more with each other, but? South Asia inter-regional trade is just 5 per cent of the total trade. It shows we are nowhere near where we want to be,? Samarawickrama said at the India Economic Summit, jointly organised by WEF and CII.
?Of course, there are many obstacles like high cost trading within the region, absence of regional value chain? First of all, it is extremely important to have India and Pakistan, the two largest economies in the region, to find a way of working together.?
Asked if it was essential for India and Pakistan trade to pick up for rest of the countries to work with each other, he said:
?I am not saying that, individually we have all the countries? Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan having reasonable growth. If we are looking at regional economic population, India and Pakistan will have to find a way of working together.?
On trade with India, the minister said both countries are looking at deepening their ties further.
?From Sri Lanka?s point of view, we have a free trade agreement with India and now, we are in the process of deepening that agreement. We are looking at a more comprehensive economic and technological cooperation that we hope is in place by the first quarter of the next year,? Samarawickrama said.
?At the same time, we are invigorating the FTA we have with Pakistan. So, from our point of view, we are looking at a market of 1.5 billion people,? he added.
The country is also working closely with China to bolster its economy. He clarified that it is not at the expense of any other country.
?We are discussing FTA with China. We hope to do it by March next year,? Samarawickrama added.

Responding to the Premier?s comments, Minister Nitin Gadkari said the Indian government would facilitate the proposed construction.
?India has the latest technology for road construction. Constructing roads using cement and concrete can last for more than fifty years without any maintenance. When comparing road construction rates with other countries, Indian technology is much cheaper,? Minister Gadkari said.

Karu accuses Wimal of threatening him
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday accused joint opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa of threatening him when he attempted to restrain the government and opposition MPs over the gazette notification on the Value Added Tax (VAT) Amendment Bill. However Mr. Weerawansa denied the allegation.
However, the argument flared up when Acting Finance Minister Lakshman Yapa presented the observations of the government printer and the Attorney General (AG) with regard to the date in which the Bill had been gazetted.
MP Bandula Gunawardene who raised an objection said the gazette had been issued prior to the approval of the Cabinet.
MP Dinesh Gunawardene who joined the argument said the AG?s letter did not refer to the gazette notification. Meanwhile, MP Wimal Weerawansa who also came up with a similar sentiment said the letter by the government printer was irrelevant.
However, Minister Abeywardena stated that the letters were sent by the government printer and the AG in response to an inquiry made by his ministry with regard to the Bill and the gazette.
?The general gazette is issued every Friday while supplements are printed thereafter. Therefore, the date of issue should be September 13, 2016,? Mr. Abeywardena said reading out the letter sent by the government printer.
?I am of the view that the provisions of the Draft Bill are not inconsistent with the Constitution. The Bill is not subject to any prohibitions or restrictions imposed by the 13th Amendment to the Constitution,? he added, quoting from the letter sent by the AG.
Meanwhile, Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said there was no issue as a minister had the right to present a Bill to Parliament when it was approved by the Cabinet as per the Constitution.
Joining this heated discussion, Minister SB Dissanayake said there was no issue in printing the gazette before approval of a Bill by the Cabinet, as it stands void if was not approved.
However, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said there was nothing to argue about as he had accepted the presentation of the Bill. (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)

Muslims will be protected: MR
	
Former President and Kurunegala District Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa, who initiated engagements with leaders of the Muslim community after the defeat at the Presidential Election last year, said Muslims would be protected and given all their rights.
Addressing a gathering of Muslims at his office in Battaramulla recently, he said the bulk of Muslims voted against him at the last election and it was one of the main reasons for his defeat .
?I have never been a communalist nor can I be one in the future. My association with Muslims runs right upto our family artery-ancestry. My father and forefathers largely helped Muslims to be settled down in various places in the Hambantota district and provided them with all facilities to build up a robust life,? he said.
He said during the last Presidential election campaign the vicious propaganda was unleashed by his opponents political power, and Muslims were unfortunately believed them.
?It was a well-orchestrated foreign conspiracy. Those elements who unleashed mayhem in Aluthgama are now happily enjoying Ministerial positions in the present government.
He said he was abroad, and on arrival at the airport he went straight to the areas, and took speedy action to rebuild the houses and business premises, and restore normal life. The Western conspirators never rested; they carried on various attacks on.
Former Minister AHM Azwer Muslims had begun to rally round Mahinda Rajapaksa.
?There is a massive cry from Muslim quarters demanding him to form a new government. When Bandaranaike broke away from UNP it was Dr. Badiud-din Mahmud, who realizing the plight of his people in the future, with foresight and wisdom, joined hands with him and helped him to bring to power the SLFP ? led by the pancha balawegaya. Leaders like CAS Marikar, Seyed Alavi Mowlana, Haleem Ishak, IA Cader, AL Abdul Majeed, Senator ARM Hameem, MC Ahamed, Galagedera Abdul Jabbar, Faleel Hajiar, Nowfel Hajiar and a host of others rallied round under Badiud-din?s leadership and brought about a great political change.

SLFP Senior Minister John Seneviratne today rejected claims made by UPFA MP Pavithra Wanniarachchi regarding not releasing the Seevali Ground in Ratnapura for the Joint Opposition rally on Saturday.
?They had requested a land where lorries are parked, not the Seevali Grounds. Tiron Attanayake, a former Municipal Council member, had made a request to the Municipal Council commissioner. The request letter which was dated on September 20, requested the Commissioner the land area where lorries were parked for a promotional campaign on Saturday,? the Minister said.
Later, another letter was sent to the Commissioner requesting the Seevali Ground for their promotional campaign reasoning that they are expecting more people. ?The commissioner had permitted to use the Seevali Grounds,? he said.
However, the minister said the JO had made a statement saying that they had not been allowed to use the Seevali Grounds and had been allowed to use the lorry parking ground instead.
When contacted by the Daily Mirror, Municipal Commissioner M.W. Kulathilaka said permission had been given to use the Seevali Grounds only if the Lorry parking ground was not enough to facilitate the people. ?But permission was not given to set up a stage on the ground, ?he said.

Probe if there was excessive profits by Perpetual Treasuries: Rajitha
	
Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said if there was an issue with regard to the massive profits made by Perpetual Treasuries, they would request the President for a probe on the matter.
The Perpetual Treasuries earlier linked to former Central Bank Governor Arjua Mahendran's son-in-law had recorded a profit of more than Rs.5.3 billion as at March 2015 while it had received its license to engage in bond trading only in 2013.
?If there is anything unusual it will be good to initiate a probe," the minister said and added that they have taken the initial step with regard to the Bond scandal. He was quick to note that there were no such action taken with regard to what took place during the previous regime.
He said President Sirisena was concerned about development and as such will no doubt order an inquiry.
Responding to another question, the minister admitted that the process of legal action against big- time fraudsters in the previous regime was slow and lethargic.
"I don?t know exactly where the inaction is. It may be at the Police, CID, FCID, PRECIFAC or at the Attorney General?s Department. I myself and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka have raised this issue on many occasions in the cabinet but surprisingly no progress has been made and those who mismanaged, stole and embezzled billions of rupees are still at large. Only those who controversially imported a carom board or cricket bat have been charged. This must be changed sooner than later and bring those ?thoru? and ?moru? before the law,? the minister said and pointed out that if swift action was not taken against the culprits the people would lose their confidence in the unity government.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

Proposed  US $ 50mn ADB investment to fuel new chapter of growth for HNB
	
Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB) recently announced that its board of directors has granted the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approval to purchase a substantial equity stake in the bank by way of a fresh issue of shares.?
Upon securing the regulatory approval and shareholder consent at an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM), the bank will issue new ordinary voting shares worth US $ 50 million, thereby enabling the ADB take up to 9.9 percent equity stake in the bank with the valuation of each share being based on the 30-day average trading price immediately preceding the EGM but restricted to a price band between Rs.190 ? Rs.220.
Already a premier banker serving the total needs of the nation, HNB?s breakthrough partnership with the ADB is anticipated to open up new business opportunities across multiple areas including SME, microfinance, project finance and renewable energy.?
Fuelled by this fresh infusion of capital and guided by the ADB?s own extensive technical expertise, HNB aims to further strengthen its systems and processes. As recently outlined by HNB MD/CEO Jonathan Alles, HNB is on its way on an extensive digital transformation journey. The technical assistance that would be available through this strategic investment will power a complete ?transformational process within the organisation in order to further augment HNB?s position in the digital space. HNB will also be in a position to harness technical expertise to further refine its stringent risk management framework and drive continuous process improvement.?
The ADB will also provide HNB with access to a wealth of knowledge on world-class governance standards, corporate social responsibility and sustainable banking practices which HNB aims to integrate into its own business model, risk management framework and governance practices going forward. ?
Additionally, the capital infusion will support HNB, as it moves towards implementation of more stringent capital adequacy requirements stipulated under the BASEL III regulatory framework. The ADB?s investment in HNB will serve to provide a sizable capital buffer and position HNB as one of the best capitalized commercial banks in Sri Lanka. ?
This landmark partnership with the ADB is also anticipated to significantly raise the profile of HNB on the global stage, potentially opening up new avenues for the bank to raise funding from international sources at attractive rates and long tenors, an area in which HNB has already demonstrated prolific success, most recently in relation to the raising of US $ 185 million from multilateral financial institutions including US $ 100 million from the ADB.
Furthermore, this strategic partnership will also widen the horizons for inorganic growth for HNB beyond the shores of Sri Lanka and the new investment to be made by the ADB would ultimately deliver enhanced value to all the stakeholder of HNB.
The ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth and regional integration. Established in 1966, the ADB in December 2016 will mark 50 years of development partnership in the region. It is owned by 67 members ? 48 from the region. In 2015, the ADB assistance totalled US $ 27.2 billion, including co-financing of US $ 10.7 billion.?

During the consideration of the anticipatory bail application, raising a preliminary objection, Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake revealed in court that, according to statements recorded from witnesses, the former Chief JMO Ananda Samarasekara had dispatched the samples from the refrigerator a few days prior to his retirement.
The DSG informed that the CID had had begun an investigation concerning the missing body parts under the Public Property Act -- because the body parts had earlier been taken into the former JMO's custody, as case productions and, therefore, they belonged to the State.
An anticipatory bail application can be filed by an individual seeking bail in anticipation or in expectation of being named or arrested of having committed a non-bail-able offense.

Serving indictments on Tiran, three others postponed
	
Colombo High Court Judge Kusala Sarojani Weerawardena today postponed the serving of indictments to former MP Tiran Alles and three others to November 2, since the clarification from the Supreme Court over its Interim Order was pending.
The Attorney General had filed indictments in the High Court against four accused for financial fraud amounting to Rs.200 million - including former MP Tiran Alles and former senior LTTE leader Emil Kanthan- alleged to have taken place at the Reconstruction and Development Agency (RADA) in 2006.
Earlier, during the Magisterial inquiry, Tiran Alles had filed a Fundamental Rights petition in Supreme Court seeking an order to prevent him from being arrested over the allegations.
Subsequently, the Supreme Court gave an Interim Order on every party to maintain the status-quo until the FR petition is finished. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
