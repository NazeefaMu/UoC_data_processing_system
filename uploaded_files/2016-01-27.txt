BBS accuses law enforces of double standards
	
	Different standards were applied by the law enforcers to MP Hirunika Premachandra (when she was arrested for allegedly kidnapping someone) and the Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera when he was charged with contempt of court and the disruption of court proceedings, alleged the Collective of National Bikkhu Organisations today.
	The Collective of National Bikkhu Organisations comprises the BBS, Ravana Balaya, and Sinhala Ravaya.
	The Ven. Pahiyangala Ananda Sagara Thera, speaking at a media briefing held at the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) head office, alleged that the manner in which the law enforcement agencies took action on the two incidents demonstrated that the judicial system was not the applied equally to everyone.
	He asked whether the law enforcement agencies acted only against Buddhist monks when there were many serious problems which should be addressed by them.
	Condemning the prime minister?s statement in parliament that some robe wearers were causing a tense situation in front of the Homagama Magistrate?s Court, the Thera alleged that the robe wearers were not BBS members but persons sent there by the prime minister.
	He referred to them as the ?Sirikotha/Temple Trees Force.? He requested all Buddhist monks in the country to come together to protest against injustice. He said a dharma war may erupt unless the government ensured that Buddhism could function without hindrance.
	?We were shocked upon hearing that Gnanasara Thera was remanded. They could have granted him bail because he apologised to the magistrate,? he said. (Piyumi Fonseka and Chaturanga Pradeep)

ComBank ties up with Bank Muscat Oman for instant money transfers
	
		 		 
		 
			
Instant, real-time fund transfers between Oman and Sri Lanka have become possible as a result of a tie-up between the Commercial Bank of Ceylon and Bank Muscat, the leading financial services provider in the Sultanate.
Commercial Bank is the first Sri Lankan bank to link with Bank Muscat for this purpose.?
Account holders of Bank Muscat can now use the bank?s all-new feature-rich mobile banking app to send cash remittances to recipients in Sri Lanka or transfer money to accounts at Commercial Bank 24/7. They may also transfer funds to accounts at other banks in Sri Lanka via Commercial Bank.
?Commercial Bank was already a key facilitator of remittances to Sri Lanka from Oman,? Commercial Bank?s Chief Manager e-Banking & Remittances Pradeep Banduwansa said. ?With this partnership with Bank Muscat, the remittances arrive in Sri Lanka instantly and become available to recipients within minutes.?
Users of the speed transfer facility offered by Bank Muscat?s mBanking app can send up to 500 Omani Riyals a day to Sri Lanka. The app already has more than 350,000 registered users, including Omani nationals and expatriate account holders.
Commercial Bank recently launched a similar instant funds transfer facility between Bahrain and Sri Lanka by integrating its web system with that of Bahrain Financing Co. (BFC), enabling real time remittances via BFC?s EzRemit service to beneficiaries in Sri Lanka. Commercial Bank is one of the most active players in Sri Lanka in the field of remittances, offering customers a range of options. Remitters can send money even without having an account in the bank.
The bank has its own Business Promotion Officers (BPOs) in key markets around the world where significant numbers of Sri Lankans are employed.
Commercial Bank?s overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the bank operates 18 branches and Myanmar, where it has a Representative Office in Yangon. In September 2015, the Bank received regulatory approval for the establishment of a fully-fledged Tier I Bank in the Republic of Maldives.

	However, he said there was no proper evidence to determine how the victim died.

Foreign Service: SL to follow Singapore
	
	A system of appointing non-resident ambassadors would be introduced as means of modernising the country's Foreign Service, Minister of Foreign Affairs Mangala Samaraweera informed Parliament today.
	Minister Samaraweera said this would be introduced as a recommendation of a team sent to Singapore recently to study the Foreign Service in that country.
	He said the system, which existed in Singapore was something, which cut costs down.
	The Minister said inspectors would be deployed to monitor the effectiveness of Sri Lankan missions abroad. ?We are looking towards maintaining checks and balances and control to see that the Sri Lankan missions abroad are effective" he said.
	He also said that some heads of missions had engaged in their businesses and had even sold buildings belonging to the Sri Lankan Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the countries they were serving in.
	The Minister said there was a dearth of Foreign Service officials currently as Sri Lanka had only two-third of the needed cadre to run the Foreign Service.
	He said that vacancies would be filled with qualified people. This he said would be done annually after holding Foreign Service examinations.
	Referring to an allegation made by Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardane that UNP Working Committee members were being appointed as heads of missions, Mr. Samaraweera said 34 heads of missions out of a total of 67 are career diplomats unlike during the previous regime, where there were only 15 such career diplomats.

	'Live Events', (the company that organised last December's controversial Enrique Iglesias concert at the CR&FC Grounds) had agreed to settle the tax payment to the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) after it was accused of not paying the correct amount, said Municipal Commissioner M.K.V. Anura yesterday.
	Speaking to Daily Mirror, Mr. Anura said the CMC had decided not to file a lawsuit against Live Events though they had earlier contemplated legal action.
	?The organisers agreed to settle the due payments and, therefore, there is no need to take legal action,? he said.
	The earlier decision of the CMC to take legal action came after the parties failed to reach a settlement despite several rounds of talks.
	An investigation conducted by the CMC's Treasury Department had exposed a tax fraud amounting to some Rs.30 million, based on the revenue earned by Live Events.
	According to the Commissioner, the sum which had been withheld by the organisers will soon be paid.
	The company was also blacklisted by the CMC because the tax was not paid.
	The main stakeholders of the company are former cricketing stars Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardane. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Don?t label us as Indian Tamils: TPA
	
The Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) yesterday urged the government to stop referring to the up-country Tamil community as ?Indian Tamils? and in future to refer to them as ?Indian origin Malayaga Tamils? in the New Constitution.
This was just one of the proposals made by the TPA to the government with several proposals and suggestions pertaining to Constitutional reforms.
Speaking at the media briefing held in Colombo, Upcountry New Villages, and Estate Infrastructure and Community Development Minister Palani Digambaran said the devolution of powers vested in the central government, provincial councils and local government bodies should be clarified through the new Constitution.
The TPA headed by Minister Mano Ganeshan, had appointed a sixteen-member-committee to do the spadework for the new constitution.
The political, cultural and social expectations of the people in the up-country villages will be taken into consideration and tabled in Parliament in order to form a new Constitution.
?Since attaining Independence in 1948, up-country Tamils have felt that they were excluded from the government and development projects carried out by the government. When compared to other nationalities, they are far behind in many sectors, including Health and Education. This is a result of wrong decisions made by previous governments. They no longer want to be discriminated against. Affirmative action with regard to improving the living standards of the people should be included in the Constitution,? the leader of committee P.M.Muthulingam, said.
Proposals to increase electoral representation in up-country provincial councils are also expected to be included in the proposals by the committee.
The government is urged to restore the rights of Tamils of Indian origin who live in up-country areas, the TPA said. (Piyumi Fonseka and Kalathma Jayawardhane)

	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will make a statement in Parliament with regard to the revelations made by Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne on bank accounts in Dubai belonging to a former VVIP family, an MP and a head of a government institution, which exceeded USD 3 billion.
	Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said the Prime Minister would make a statement on the issue, when a question was raised by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Dissanayake on the matter in Parliament yesterday.
	Mr. Dissanayake, who quoted Minister Senaratne said the latter had said at a press briefing that a member of a VVIP family had USD 1.08 billion in his bank account in a Dubai bank, while an MP had USD 500 million and a head of a State institution, a sum of USD 1.8 billion in their respective bank accounts in foreign banks. This statement, he said, could not be taken lightly as it had been made by the Cabinet Spokesman.
	Accordingly the Chief Opposition Whip questioned as to whether a complaint had been made by the Minister or anyone else to the relevant authorities.

Lankan government makes significant progress: HRW
	
Sri Lanka?s government has ended the pervasive culture of surveillance and censorship and embarked on reforms aimed to undo years of increasingly authoritarian rule, the Human Rights Watch (HRW) said today in its World Report 2016.
While it opened dialogues both domestically and abroad, the government still faces key concerns, including wartime accountability and prolonged detention without trial, it said.
?Sri Lanka?s new government has begun to address some of the country?s chronic human rights problems, but much remains to be done,? said Brad Adams, HRW Asia director. ?The pervasive culture of fear is largely gone and positive measures have been adopted, but the previous government?s disastrous restructuring of independent state institutions needs to be fully dismantled,?
The government of President Maithripala Sirisena promptly initiated a series of constitutional reforms including establishing a constitutional council and restoring the independence of the judiciary, police and human rights commissions.
Civil society groups are once again able to speak out safely on issues of concern. In December, the government signed the United Nations Convention against Enforced Disappearance, a step toward tackling a massive decades-long problem.
The government has yet to fulfill its pledge to abolish the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Authorities agreed to release some PTA detainees on bail, ?rehabilitate? others, and prosecute the remainder, but arrests under the PTA continued throughout the year.
Inadequate information from the security forces means there are no reliable numbers on those detained under the law. Moreover, many imprisoned PTA detainees were convicted after being tortured to confess. The government has still not put forth a plan to provide redress for those unjustly detained under the PTA.
In August, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a scathing report on unlawful attacks, killings, torture, sexual violence, and attacks on relief aid by both sides during the civil war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam that ended in 2009.
Chronic abuses distinct from the civil war, such as police abuse and security sector reform, also need to be addressed.
?For years Sri Lanka was sinking deeper into human rights despair, so the changed atmosphere under the new government has given hope to many victims of past abuses, civil society activists, and international observers,? Adams said. ?It?s now time for the Sirisena government to turn its positive words and initial actions into institutional changes that will have a lasting impact on the country,? the report said.

Joint Opp. slams Govt's stance on kidney transplantation
	
The Joint Opposition yesterday said the Government was suppressing the professionals and that was why it has stopped kidney transplantation and also opted for the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperative Agreement (ETCA) with India.
UPFA MP Ramesh Pathirana said the government should have initiated a probe to look into the media reports instead of stopping the doctors from performing kidney transplantations.
?This is a blow to the reputation of our doctors and a move of suppressing professionals,? he told a news conference.
Meanwhile, MP Roshan Ranasinghe said the move to stop kidney transplantation was a disgrace to the health sector of the country.
Western Provincial Councillor Samanmalee Sakalasuriya said the ETCA was not in favour of Sri Lanka and that such an agreement would make the country a victim of Indian and US expansionism.
She said the economy of India was enormous compared with the Sri Lankan economy and therefore, recruiting Indian professionals to fill the local job opportunities would create grave repercussions.
?The unemployment population in India is 30 million and this number is higher than the entire population of Sri Lanka. If we need to compete with the US, we should train our youth without importing Indian professionals. Our professionals too have the knowledge and skills," she said.
She reiterated that Sri Lanka should have a national policy to consult before signing any agreement with another country. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
