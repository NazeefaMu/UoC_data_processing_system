Any fool can win a LG election
	
A group of Local Government election candidates of a certain political party had stopped for tea at an eatery in a suburb in the Southern Province when some opponents from a rival political party also entered the same eatery.
A member of one political party made an observation boasting that any fool from their party was capable of winning if they contested the election. A bystander, hearing this comment and being disgruntled with the state of politics in the country retorted, "nominating such a person as a candidate by all the parties is a good idea as it would help put an end to the corruption, money rackets and even nepotism present in politics today." His comment received smirks and shouts of support from fellow bystanders.
The local politician who boasted of the popularity of his party men could not take the criticism and slithered away in embarrassment leaving his supporters to foot the bill.

Catalyst Fund and Rukula to bring machine learning to financial inclusion
	
?
Rukula (Pvt) Ltd announced their selection as a Catalyst Fund company recently, and in doing so establishing itself as the first Sri Lankan company to become part of this global inclusive fintech initiative.?
Rukula is the now three-year-old start-up founded by Reeza Zarook, who inspired Sri Lanka?s e-commerce industry by launching Anything.lk / WOW.lk.
Catalyst Fund (www.catalyst-fund.org) is a philanthropic grant fund providing capital and tailored advisory engagements to fintech companies, with the support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and JP Morgan Chase & Co, with Rockefeller Philanthropy Associates as fiscal sponsor.? Catalyst Fund looks for early-stage startups that have the potential to scale innovative approaches to financial inclusion, and seeks to share lessons from its direct work with fintech companies. Catalyst Fund is managed by BFA, a global consulting firm specialized in using finance to create solutions for low-income populations. To-date, 10 companies have been included in the programme, of which only 2 previously have been in India.
?Rukula is the first company in our portfolio from Sri Lanka and we?re excited about bringing machine learning and artificial intelligence to their credit scoring process,? said David del Ser, Catalyst Fund Programme Director, ?Rukula scaled a business in three years without external funding, and in the process garnered real data on 17,000 customers. These rich datasets will lead to insights on scaling fintech approaches in emerging markets.?
Brian Cayce, a venture capitalist from Grey Ghost Ventures, who sponsored Rukula for Catalyst Fund said, ?I liked Rukula?s approach, and was particularly intrigued with the opportunity to match some of the artificial intelligence and machine learning tools developed within the Catalyst Fund to the business model developed by Rukula. The combination should be a big win for Rukula?s targeted customers, as it will further lay the foundation for highly-scalable growth going forward.?? ? ? ?
?
Reeza Zarook, founder CEO said, ?To be accepted into Catalyst Fund is a huge stamp of approval from the global social impact community that Rukula?s innovative approach to financial inclusion can make a difference.?
We started Rukula because we saw that a significant segment of the population was excluded from acquiring basic household durables ? items that most of us take for granted.? To-date, we have helped over 19,000 people improve their quality of life by being able to buy small goods on installments without the need for payslips, guarantors or collateral.? We hope that the engagement with the Catalyst Fund team at BFA can continue to propel our growth exponentially.?

?Discipline is the foundation for a peaceful society?
	
?
?
?
DailyMirror sat with former Education Minister, UNP strongman and current ambassador to Sri Lanka in China, Dr. Karunasena Kodituwakku for an interview during a visit to the island.?
Dr. Kodituwakku spoke about Sri Lanka-China relations, Chinese investments in the island and politics. Following are excerpts of the interview done with?Dr. Kodituwakku.
?I am aware that the Chinese Government provided financial grants worth RMB 600 million in the year 2017?
	?We must understand the reality ? that our capacity to invest?is limited?
	?Today, China is a US$ 12 trillion GDP economy and Sri Lanka is still a US$ 85 billion GDP economy?
	?When the value of an investment is huge, it is natural that any investor would demand a long lease.?
	?Whenever a new project or a policy is introduced, a common feature in Sri Lanka is that some people tend to imagine?it?s negative?
Q China has become the biggest donor and investor in Sri Lanka. How do you see this development?
Yes, with the two mega investment projects of leasing the Hambantota Port and the ongoing Port City Project in Colombo in addition to other medium and large investment projects involving China in tourist-related and other industrial investments, China emerged as the largest foreign direct investor in Sri Lanka during the year 2017.? ?
However, I don?t know the exact figures with regard to China being a donor. Donations normally include financial assistance grants, which are not loans, and loans that are given on concessionary terms -having very low interest compared with the prevailing market rate- long grace periods to commence repayments and a longer period for full payment to be made, etc.
I am aware that the Chinese Government provided financial grants worth RMB 600 million in the year 2017 to build a Kidney Hospital in Polonnaruwa. This grant was given when President Maithripala Sirisena made an official visit to China and assured a further RMB 2 billion during 2018 and 2019 when Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe met the Chinese President in May 2017.?
In China, no one is above the law. Our problem is that the majority of our people are not committed to observing the law. Discipline is the foundation for a peaceful society. ?
Q But the joint Opposition always has something negative to say about this close cooperation, friendship and help extended towards Sri Lanka by China. Your comments??
Since I am giving this interview as the Ambassador representing Sri Lanka in China, I do not wish to respond to the views of the joint Opposition (JO). However, I would like to comment on the negative views expressed with regard to China?s involvement going by what I have seen in media.? ?
Whenever a new project or a policy is introduced, a common feature in Sri Lanka is that some people tend to imagine its negative possibilities rather than its positive impact. I would like to quote an interesting story that was related to me by a senior member of a leftist party in Sri Lanka who visited China a few months ago. He told me that when economic reforms were introduced in China by the late Deng Xiaoping in late 1970s, they were very critical and considered those reforms to be as reactionary as well as counter-revolutionary. I told him that such irrational critics were fortunately in Sri Lanka and not in China. That is why today, China is a US$ 12 trillion GDP economy and Sri Lanka is still a US$ 85 billion GDP economy.? ?
Since you mentioned about the JO, I would like to invite them to read the agreements signed by the two Foreign Ministers of China and Sri Lanka when the Chinese President visited Sri Lanka in 2014. The President of Sri Lanka at that time was the current JO?s leader when Mahinda Rajapaksa led the regime. In those agreements, the two countries have clearly agreed to operate the Magampura / Hambantota Port Project jointly. Therefore, it would be better to study those agreements before anyone makes further comments.? ?
Q Did Sri Lanka actually sell the Hambantota Port, a portion of reclaimed land of the Port City, and vast extent of land in Hambantota for an investment zone as conditions of the various development agreements that were signed between the two countries in the recent past as claimed by the JO?
In addition to the agreements signed in the recent past, there were agreements that were signed in 2014. As far as I am aware of, the agreements signed recently have given land and the Sea Port on long lease because no investor will invest further if there is no guarantee for a long period of lease.? ?
When the value of an investment is huge, it is natural that any investor would demand a long lease. Do not forget that the investment that was already made was huge and that that investment in addition to the due interest must be paid on time to retain the credit worthiness of Sri Lanka. In addition to that, the next stages of the Hambantota Port must be built because otherwise what we have already invested with credit facilities will be a waste.? ?
The conditions of the agreements between the two countries have been honoured in the past as far as China is concerned. Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 after 150 years since the Opium War days. Similarly, Macau was returned to China after 500 years by?the Portuguese.? ?
The Hambantota Port agreements signed recently have given the land and the Sea Port on long lease because no investor will invest further if there is no guarantee for a long period?of lease
Q How will these negative comments by the JO affect Sri Lanka ? China relations?
Naturally, when negative comments are made, any investor would think about them. However, fortunately, most Chinese investments are made with the blessings of the relevant Government agencies, both national and provincial. Therefore, I do not think they would change their mind due to such negative comments. Chinese investors consider the advice given to them by their Government agencies.? ?
Q Do you think Chinese investors will think twice before investing in Sri Lanka because of these negative comments by the JO??
The only comment I would like to make again on the same subject is that we have missed many opportunities since Sri Lanka introduced reforms in 1977 due to this kind of irresponsible comments and the armed rebellions we have had in the past. No country can develop in isolation. The message I would like to convey here is that China has repeatedly given two fundamental reasons for its economic success: (a) the economic reforms introduced in1978 (In fact, this year, China is making arrangements to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the introduction of these economic reforms) and (b) the joining of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, which paved the way to export Chinese products to almost all the countries in the world, making the China the world?s factory.? ?
Q As an economist and diplomat, what do you think Sri Lanka must do to attract more Foreign Direct?Investments (FDI)?
What we must do with regard to attracting FDI is to speak to the world in one voice, regardless whether you belong to the Government, opposition or function in any other capacity. We must understand the reality ? that our capacity to invest is limited. All the countries that developed rapidly during the past 5 to 6 decades did it through FDIs. As the second-largest economy in the world today, China did it over the past 4 decades with the support of FDIs.
South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, which are known as economic Tigers, achieved rapid development with FDIs. Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, which followed the economic Tigers, did it in the same way with FDIs. Our largest neighbour, India, did it as well starting as early as in the 1990s with the blessings of FDIs.? ?
China introduced economic reforms in 1978 and within two decades, China?s GDP more than quadrupled. Without innovations and experiments that are based on tested policies, no country can move forward
?
Q China was considered a poor third world country in the 70s. During my visit to China last November, I witnessed an unbelievable industrial, IT and infrastructural revolution taking place in China. How did the Chinese people achieve this development in such a short period of time?
Yes, you are correct. When the Chinese Communist party?s political leadership, headed by Deng Xiaoping, decided to introduce economic reforms in 1978, the whole party machinery and bureaucracy collectively supported and backed the reforms. These reforms were first introduced on the basis of a pilot project in Shenzhen, the fishing village close to Hong Kong. In fact, it is one of the first projects that was implemented by the China Merchant Group, which leased out the Hambantota Port, in addition to their terminal in Colombo Port.? ?
This is why some analysts in China claim that China?s economy is now transitioning from being a ?World Factory? to a ?World Market.? The strength of China?s consumer market would be US$ 9 trillion by 2030. That is why more and more countries want to sign FTAs with China.? ?
Q One of the rare setbacks in the Chinese society I witnessed was the poor knowledge of a second language or that of a another global language which creates a communication gap. Do?you agree?
China has 1.4 billion people and out of them the majority use only their mother tongue. However, there are more and more people communicating in English, particularly students in universities and employees in the corporate sector. They are now using foreign languages and not only English, but other languages such as Japanese, French, German, Spanish, Russian, Korean, etc. Young people are very keen on learning English and whenever they need to understand better, they simply touch their smart phones to access the correct understanding?in Chinese.??
What we must do to attract FDI is to speak to the world in one voice, regardless of whether you belong to the Government, Opposition or function in any other capacity. We must understand the reality ? that our capacity to invest is limited
Q One of the biggest differences between Sri Lanka and China that I have observed was the lack of discipline among Sri Lankans while the Chinese are an extremely disciplined and law-abiding nation. Your comments??
Yes, you are correct. In China, no one is above the law. Our problem is that the majority of our people are not committed to observing the law. Discipline is the foundation for a peaceful society.? ?
Q You have served the country for nearly four decades as a politician (Education Minister), an academic (Vice Chancellor) and a diplomat (Ambassador to Japan, South Korea and China). Don?t you have any intentions of re-entering politics, contesting the elections and becoming a Minister in a future UNP Government?
Diplomacy is international politics. A unique aspect in the various roles of my career has been the fact that I was entrusted to do jobs I never expected. I became a Vice Chancellor not because I wanted it, but the then Higher Education Minister President Jayewardene asked me to take over that position due to the troubled situation that prevailed at the Sri Jayewardenepura University in 1982. I was appointed as Ambassador to Japan, again by President Jayawardene?s Government, in 1987 due to the unsettled situation that prevailed in the country. At that time, even Vice Chancellors were being assassinated.? ?
Then President Premadasa, who became the President in 1989, appointed me to South Korea as the Ambassador there. Then in 1993, the then President D. B. Wijetunga asked me to be his Governor of the North Western Province, again without any request being made by me. Then I contested and was elected to Parliament in 1994, as I wanted it at that time. That was a unique opportunity I got as I expected. However, although I never dreamed of being the Education and Cultural Affairs Minister, I was given these portfolios by the then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. I am an Economist so I expected a portfolio that was relevant to my professional background.? ?
Then again in 2015, I did not expect to be a diplomat again, but it was my destiny, and that is why I am here. Therefore, I do not know what my next responsibility may be. My past experience has been that I was given what I did not expect.Therefore, I leave the rest also to my destiny!? ?
The Hambantota Port agreements signed recently have given the land and the Sea Port on long lease because no investor will invest further if there is no guarantee for a long period?of lease
Q You took the initiative to arrange the marriages of 50 young Chinese couples in Sri Lanka in a glittering ceremony at the Town Hall Grounds in Colombo. Could you briefly enlighten our readers as to what was the procedure adopted to select the bride and groom, and whether this is going to be an annual feature in Sri Lanka?s tourism calendar as well as who funded the event?
For this initiative, the Embassy of Sri Lanka facilitated the Chinese promoters by giving the Embassy premises to establish their credibility among Chinese parents and couples. Here, I must record that the initial concept came from John Amaratunga, the Minister of Tourism, when he visited China in 2016. He convinced the Chinese promoters. We, the Embassy, moving beyond conventional diplomatic duties, facilitated and encouraged them continuously. That is why it became a grand success. We have already received sufficient publicity in the Chinese media for this event. I have no doubt that this is a very positive marketing event as far as tourism promotion is concerned. The future would depend on the business viability of the project concerned for the relevant?
business entities.? ?
Finally, I would like to say a few words about the responsibility of the media, which has an enormous responsibility in nation building. Although I am a trained academic professionally, I have no intention of teaching anyone, but rather wish to stress the importance of understanding the critical responsibility of the media profession when communicating with the masses. It is easy to inflame, but it is not that easy to prevent a fire spreading when it becomes a wildfire. Finally, the whole society will pay for it. Sri Lanka has already paid heavily for the fires that have been inflamed by some since independence.? ?

Father Sully was a gentle counselor
	
On 18th January 1956, Father Lawrence W. Sullivan, SSS, entered priesthood at St. Patrick?s Cathedral. He said his First Mass at St. Francis Church, Melbourne, on 19th January 1956 and entered the Lord?s Vineyard of Eternal Rest on 30th December 2017, also in Melbourne. On the occasion of the 60th Anniversary of his ordination, Father Sullivan said his life was strongly focused on the Eucharist by the time he was fifteen or sixteen. It was the real presence in the Eucharist that was central to his calling.? ?
Shortly after his ordination, Father Sully, as he was affectionately known, was posted to the SSS Community in Sri Lanka. Father Sully was a gentle counselor, pastor and friend to almost all who knew him; not just because he was a brilliant orator, but because his humane approach always extended beyond the spiritual to the mundane. ?Humane? that was his most brilliant characteristic, Father never found it difficult to relate to the humane and that is what endeared him to everyone.? ?
Father Sully was ?the Happy Wanderer? happiest on his motor bike, roaming the hills and dales of our country, taking the solace of the Eucharist and the comfort of his reassuring presence to all those who needed it.? ?
Father Sully celebrated his own Golden Jubilee on 5th February 2006 at his home parish in Melbourne.? ?
In obedience to the call of Vatican II, Father Sully was the first to boldly turn the altar around to face the congregation, doing away with the throne of exposition and initiating the veneration of the Blessed Sacrament on the altar itself, symbolizing prayer and contemplation of the Eucharist.? ?
Having reminisced about your precious life in Ministry, my appreciation would be incomplete without mentioning how precious you were in my life dear Father. We talked, we walked, we spent moments in time. You passed through my life and left your mark, not for an hour, not for a day but for a lifetime! You were always there and no matter what I want to say ?Thank You? for the impressions you left. I was so blessed when your life touched mine; so many years that I was privileged to call you ?friend.?? ?
Your religious fervor and belief in God carried you through the ravages of time. Always the sweetest, gentlest man about town. When so many people pass me by, I stop and ask why only you left your mark? My question may never be answered, but there is one thing I want you to know dearest Father of my heart, I was so very blessed by the impact you made on me that moment, so long ago, the day, the hour the moment your life touched mine.? ?
This brings you a very special ?thank you? for all you have been and will always be to me dear Father of my heart. Rest now, dear Father, close to the heart of the God you loved so much.? ?
With a heart?
Full of love.? ?

Govt. to call for new oil, gas exploration bids
	
The third licensing round to offer offshore blocks for oil and gas exploration and development in northern Sri Lanka will take place over the next three months, according to state-run Petroleum Resource Development Secretariat (PRDS).
?We are planning to conduct the third licensing round for some of the remaining blocks in the Mannar and Cauvery basins in the first quarter of this year,? PRDS Benefits Director Preeni Withanage told Mirror Business.
Earlier this week, in a notice to the potential bidders in the third licensing round, the PRDS said that some blocks, which have already drawn investor interest, would be opened for bidding.
It added that the new round is a culmination of efforts undertaken by the PRDS over the past year and would hopefully result in the commencement of substantial off-shore exploration work.
The Petroleum Resource Development Ministry late last year took a decision to expedite exploration and development of indigenous offshore oil and gas resources.
The PRDS continued to build up this momentum last week by opening a bidding round for proposals to conduct airborne geophysical surveys on a multi-client basis over the Mannar and Cauvery basins, related to the blocks up for offer in the third licensing rounds.
Sri Lanka has so far made two natural gas discoveries in the ?M2? block, which was awarded in the first licensing round in 2007. There was limited interest in the second licensing round in 2013 and even the three bids submitted were not awarded.
There are totally five blocks in the Cauvery basin and eight blocks in the Mannar basin.
Based on the initial studies, data and regional studies, the PRDS is estimating the Mannar basin alone could have the potential to generate five billion barrels of oil and nine trillion cubic feet of natural gas, which would be sufficient for Sri Lanka?s energy needs for the next 60 years.
This is in addition to the more than two trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 10 million barrels of condensate discovered in two deposits in the M2 block.
Since Sri Lanka?s new power generation policy heavily favours natural gas, discovery and development of local gas deposits could result in significant foreign exchange savings, according to the PRDS.
Downstream operations are already being designed, the PRDS said this week.
?An all-inclusive platform for gas delivery and off-take channels has been identified and worked upon for approval by the relevant downstream regulators,? it said. (Chandeepa Wettasinghe)

Highway network of Colombo to begin soon: PM
	
Construction work on a highway network designed to ease the traffic congestion in the Colombo City will begin soon, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
Mr. Wickremesinghe revealed this at a UNP Bala Mandala meeting held at Havelock City last evening.
?Construction work on an elevated highway from Kelaniya to Fort will begin soon with a highway coming from Battaramulla Junction getting connected to it. In addition,?internal waterways would be made use of for transportation thus easing the burden on the roads,? the Prime Minister said.
Revealing further plans for the city, he said the City of Colombo will be powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG) soon. ?Three such power plants will be set up to resolve the energy issue in Colombo with Japan and India each funding a plant,? he explained.
He said Colombo would be developed as a City which connects Kandy and Hambantota.?The previous regime boasted about their deeds of beautifying Colombo, however this has only resulted in pushing the country further into a debt trap and it is our government that has to bear the burden,? he said.
The Prime Minister highlighted that this government, in addition to paying past debts,?now has the additional burden of the garbage problem. ?Many thought that we will not shift the Meethotamulla garbage dump but we have shifted it to Puttalam,? he said.
UNP Mayoral Candidate for the Colombo District Rosy Senanayake, speaking on the occasion, promised to turn the City of Colombo into a smart city.
?Colombo will have to develop and become a modern city parallel to the Port City and I am determined to take up this challenge,? she said.
She also pledged to find a lasting solution to the garbage issue and eradicate dengue in Colombo. (Yohan Perera)

President clarifies reason for seeking SC opinion
	
President Maithripala Sirisena made a reference to the Supreme Court to ascertain whether he can serve in office for six years because there were divergent views on his term limit in civil and political circles, his office said in a statement.
The statement said the President had sought the opinion of the Supreme Court as otherwise it could lead to confusion.
The statement said his predecessors had also made similar references to the Supreme Court in this manner. It said it was a right guaranteed in the Constitution.

President has no moral right to extend term of office: Basil
	
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) frontliner Basil Rajapaksa today said there was no moral basis for President Maithripala Sirisena to extend his term for six years as he committed himself to reduce the term in the run up to the elections .
Mr. Rajapaksa told a news conference President Sirisena had claimed during his presidential election campaign that he would reduce the term of presidency to four years and would not seek to stay for six years.
?It is necessary to keep in mind that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has also only served for four years as the President in his second term of office. In the fourth year former President Rajapaksa went for a presidential election,? he said.
He said even President Sirisena could have gone for an election after four years and added that however President Sirisena extended the term to five years after the enactment of the 19th Amendment.
He said now President Sirisena was in an attempt extend his term for six years. He also said irrespective of the legal background, it was not morally appropriate for President Sirisena to do so considering his pre-election promises.
?The legal background of this situation will be decided by the Courts and we have complete faith in it. However it is certain that the legislation will not allow it,? he said.
Meanwhile, he said the appointment of someone from the United National Party(UNP) as the Prime Minister was the gravest humiliation inflicted on the Sri Lanka? Freedom Party?s (SLFP) founder leader S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike.
?UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe could never become the Prime Minister through a popular vote. Yet, he was appointed as the Prime Minister. The UNP is a blood-stained party over the assassination of Mr. Bandaranaike,? he alleged.
He also said the UNP deprived SLFP leader Sirimavo Bandaranaike of civic rights and the appointment of someone from that party as the Prime Minister was the most heinous crime perpetrated on Mr. Bandaranaike.(Kelum Bandara and Kalathma Jayawardhane)

President?s term: JO will intervene and make submissions in SC
	
The Joint Opposition will intervene and make submissions when the reference made by President Maithripala Sirisena to the Supreme Court regarding his term limit is taken up for consideration today before a five-judge bench.
President?s Counsel Manohara de Silva will make submissions on behalf of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris.
The reference by the President says: ?Whether in terms of Provisions of the Constitution, I, as the person elected and succeeding to the office of President and having assumed such office in terms of Article 32(1) of the Constitution on January 9, 2015, have any impediment to continue in the office of President for a period of six years from January 9, 2015, the date on which the result of my election to the office of President was declared.?
Commenting on it, Prof. Peiris said the President clearly told the country that he agreed to reduce his term when the 19th Amendment was introduced.
?He said his wish was to reduce it to four years, not five years. He said his colleagues insisted that it should be five years. Reluctantly, he agreed to five years.
Also, the former Minister said the President gave a solemn pledge in front of the coffin of Ven. Maduluwave Sobhitha Thera to abolish the executive presidency. (Kelum Bandara)

## Title: Some reflections on the cultural bourgeoisie

Some reflections on the cultural bourgeoisie
	
The cultural bourgeoisie is a curious creature. But then the Colombans, or the Kolombians as Malinda Seneviratne calls them, usually are. They live within municipal limits of the city, failing which they live in one of those suburbs which give the impression of being closer to the neighbouring rural hinterlands that the likes of me have lived throughout our lives. The latter subset, by the way, are the bourgeois bohemians, or bobos as David Brooks called them, and as Malinda described them some time back, they surround themselves with cultural artefacts that are supposed to indicate that they are purveyors of culture, local and/or foreign.
Now the area around Race Course and the Lionel Wendt subsists on a dichotomy, between eateries on the one hand and shops selling such artefacts on the other. It?s interesting to note the demographics that patronise each; the young usually eat, the old usually buy. The Kolombians, in other words, become or think they become bobos as they mellow.? ?
Years ago I attended a classical music concert that was held at the Musaeus College Auditorium (newly built back then) and was led by a prominent German conductor whose name I unfortunately don?t remember now. Before the curtains opened, however, I had to, against my will, keep up with the conversations that were springing up around me, between the ladies and gentlemen, the Kolombians, who were moving from one topic to another in quick succession while keeping to a welter of formality and uniformity with respect to what they really wanted to talk about. They talked of drama, of the movies, of music, but they then talked of how their kith and kin and nephews and nieces and so on and so forth knew each other.? ?
So Kolombian A was talking with Kolombian B about how her son happened to have been in the same Debating Society that Kolombian B?s son was, how their husbands had attended the same Societies, had even been Prefects in the same batch, and how bloodlines established with respect to schools and other such institutions attended proved that their families were meant for each other. Before this graduated to marriage proposals, though, the show began (to my relief). But as that prominent German conductor impressed me with Beethoven?s Fifth Symphony (I prefer the Second Movement to the First) and the Overture to Mozart?s Magic Flute, I turned around and saw, to my astonishment, these same purveyors of drama and movies and music sleeping. The music which was supposed to impress them had put them to slumber. These grown up bobos weren?t talking. They were instead snoring. Throughout.? ?
The Kolombian bourgeois bohemians are a curious bunch because of a contradiction that lies at the heart of their milieu, between their aspirations and their realities. This is as true for their political affiliations as it is for their cultural affiliations. It would of course be crass to brush their society as clueless and indifferent when it comes to the rest of the country, but such crass simplifications exist because, as Gomin Dayasri has pointed out years ago, they believe they know everything because of the inbuilt advantages that the metropolis is supposed to bring; multiculturalism, modernity, privileged education. Such inbuilt advantages are not the preserve of those who live in Colombo only, but because of their defining marks ? high fluency in English and lack of fluency in the mother tongue, Sinhala or Tamil ? they have been able so far to market themselves as purveyors and promoters of high culture, art, etc.? ?
The paradox
In whatever cultural sphere in whatever country, there is almost always a disjuncture between the multitude and the elite, between the street-smart and the book-smart, in other words between mass consumption and discriminating tastes. Be it the cinema, the theatre, literature, or art, the tropes the artists resort to reflect that disjuncture. The situation is not much different in Sri Lanka; our playwrights (if it?s an English play), for instance, tend to lampoon the unprivileged as naive, gullible, idiotic, and the privileged as intelligent, able, worthy.
You see this paradox crop up the other way around in our children?s movies: from Siri Raja Siri to Paha Samath, the poor are portrayed as smart, idealistic, while the rich are portrayed as weak, effete. Such dichotomies lack the conviction they require, but they are based on popular views of the rich and the poor and they tend to take in rupees and cents at the box office.? ?
The Kolombians usually display a culture of condescension towards the rest of the country and, fittingly it would seem, the rest of the country returns that compliment. I believe that?s why Sinhala novelists, playwrights, directors, and scriptwriters resort to that timeless and overused trope of English-speakers-who-relapse-to-Sinhala-when-threatened.
There?s an episode in Bodima in which Buddhi Wickrama is an English teacher to the most intelligent member of the titular bodima (played by Jayalath Manoratne), and this teacher consciously never speaks Sinhala, only high-flown English. When he?s about to be whacked, when he?s about to be thrown out violently, by the most ruffian-like resident of that bodima (I believe he was played by Daya Alwis), though, he stutters, stammers, and begs for mercy using the Sinhala he pretended not to know. They are all pretenders, hence: they know what they want us to think they don?t. That, incidentally, is one of many episodes of tele-dramas I?ve seen which play around the trope. It?s used even in our novels, our films, our plays.? ?
McDonald?s and India?s Gandhi
But let me get back to that subset of the Kolombians I am concerned about, the bourgeois bohemians, or the cultural bourgeoisie. In the eighties and the seventies, the American corporate sector teemed with advertisements that referred to quotes by Gandhi, the Beat Generation, the Buddha, the Taoists, and Confucius. It was, as David Brooks (who wrote Bobos in Paradise) contended in a New York Times article, a set of ?peculiar juxtapositions?, because how on earth could America?s McDonald?s and India?s Gandhi ever come together? In the early decades of the 20th century, it had been relatively easy to distinguish between the bourgeois culture and the bohemian counterculture. It was the bohemians who were behind the sixties counterculture (Godard, in his films, which were parodies of popular American myths, depicted these bohemians as the pop revolutionaries they were). They came from a largely White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) demographic, from which the bobos emerged.? ?
Colombo is very much a stratified society, and so is the United States, but it was the diffusion of different sensibilities, the sense of being Americano, that led to a culture of bobos to flourish rampantly in the latter. America was never really the Land of the Free (it wasn?t even the bastion of democracy that writers believed it to be: Gore Vidal, I believe at the Galle Literary Festival, observed years ago that the American Constitution doesn?t once contain the word ?democracy?) but there probably hasn?t been any other culture, in modern times, where the arts got together so sleekly. The bobos of America could have been bankers or artists, so much so that differences of class disappeared, at least to an extent, and gave birth to a heavily self-parodying society. If Pauline Kael?s assertion that no other country could criticise and satirise itself appears overblown, it?s because there?s a touch of sincerity in what she wrote.? ?
Malinda wrote a series of satirical sketches, from the perspective of an unnamed narrator, parodying our bobos in 2014 and 2015 (?Notes of an Unrepentant Kolombian?). These sketches instilled some relevance to the January 2015 Election (which thanks to statements by Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and Mahinda Rajapaksa, turned out to be a tussle between the baiyas and the toiyas), and they delved into certain issues pertaining to those bobos: the bursary (they are financially enriched, endowed), their lack of awareness of their language (?Their offspring can barely manage enna, giya, or awa?), their monopoly over commerce (regardless of who?s in power), and the relationships between Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe (?Forget Mahinda and Maithri, the Kolombians want Alastair Cook?). From these sketches the final sketch of our bobos comes out: neither here nor there, wallowing in the cosmetics of a culture they aren?t aware of. There is hence a fatal contradiction, as I mentioned at the beginning, between their aspirations and their realities.? ?
It?s not ?our? culture they inhabit, consequently, rather the cosmetics thereof: the mask, the drum, the exotic dances, the archaic music, which we inherited. In an age where finance capital and commerce in themselves are not enough, when the age of information has made obsolete the conventional capitalist, financiers and speculators and executives are playing Gershwin on their pianos, flocking in droves to see our dances and drums being performed and played out at the Lionel Wendt, holding literary festivals which ostensibly advertise the ?local culture? but which in reality congeal into a celebration of their narrow circle.
That?s the difference between them and us: we are more content in imitating the American yuppie and bobo, instead of nurturing and fermenting our own culture of yuppies and bobos. In aesthetics as in politics and economics and everything else, we thus remain, to the last drop, imitators. We will talk of how sophisticated we are when we meet at a concert, but the minute the show starts, we will start yawning, shrug indifferently, snore, and finally, snuggle.?

Speaker responsible for turmoil in parliament: JO
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya must be held responsible for the commotion that took place in parliament yesterday because it was he who had failed to obtain a copy of the bond commission report, the joint opposition said.
JO member and MP, Keheliya Rambukwella told a recent news conference that the Speaker had been influenced by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
?Party leaders met on Tuesday to discuss the letter sent by the Prime Minister requesting to summon the parliament to debate the bond commission report. In fact it was MP Dinesh Gunawardena who had written to the Prime Minister asking him to request the Speaker to summon parliament under Standing Orders,? he said.
Subsequently, the party leaders had met and decided to obtain a copy of this report and it was expected to be distributed among the parliamentarians giving them sufficient time to prepare for the debate.
?But at the start of the sittings, the Speaker said he was unable to obtain a copy of the report and this had led to the commotion. At this point, the Attorney General was also in the House and he would have obviously had a copy. If the Speaker had genuinely wanted to obtain a copy of the report, he could have done so. The report is on a major Central Bank bond scam and the MPs were deprived of the very purpose of being summoned. The Speaker should be held responsible for this unfortunate situation,? he said.

Tense situation in House, set up by Govt: CaFFe
	
The tense situation that prevailed in Parliament was a deliberate act created by the government to sabotage the parliamentary session on the bond report debate, Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon said.
He said the government was aware of the main culprit who should be held responsible for the bond scam, the government headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe wanted to create chaos in parliament and divert the attention of the MPs.
?This is for the first time in the history of parliament that such a situation was created with the intervention of a Prime Minister. We ask why the Premier was shouting ?Mahinda hora?, when Mahinda Rajapaksa has no connection with the bond scam that took place in 2015. Thus, it is apparent that the government had intended diverting the attention of the MPs from debating the bond report,? Mr. Tennakoon said.
He said the government could not continue to get away from the issue and would have to face reality. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

## Title: The  poor little  handicrafts of Laksala

The  poor little  handicrafts of Laksala
	
Alias, an Assistant Merchandising Director, tells me that Laksala is changing. Not for the better. If we are to talk in analogies for the benefit of tourists, he is claiming a slide down the scale from a Tiffany?s to a K-Mart. ?I went to the Thummulla outlet today. They are going to shift the exclusive Batik collection to a less prominent place and put some t-shirts in the vacant place,? Alias told me in November. 
One can sympathize with his outrage. Who shifts an exotic merchandise of a higher style register like Batik to make way for t-shirts? Why would people try to turn around a loss-making enterprise-comprising ordinary items- through bulk sales? People are turning their backs on niche markets due to lack of vision, money?and expertise.? ?
All the stratagems have been introduced to enable Laksala to operate in the black and execute this responsibility
	A sector gets into trouble when its custodians?start thinking of it as a dying sector, when they think of maintaining the sector as CSR
	Teas by various Sri Lankan producers were sold under the Laksala brand
	Nobody wanted?to wear Salusala?s handloom textiles, and it soon closed down
Alias doesn?t know. All he knows is that Laksala is being deviated from its remit and mandate set out in the Laksala Act (The National Crafts Council and the Allied Bodies Act 35 of 1982), to support and encourage Sri Lankan handcrafts by showcasing them for a discerning global market. If the powers that be are phasing out handcrafted exotica and turning Laksala into a mass market department store, they can?t do it. Alias informs me, not without changing the Act first. Nowadays, he remarks with a wince, Laksala merchandise even includes shirts with their brand labels cut off and male underwear.? ?
?You try to go into any Laksala miss, and try to find a ?rata pedura? (a reed mat woven in an ornamental pattern in colour), you won?t find it.? That?s an ominous statement. To use an analogy, again, it?s like claiming that a national crafts outlet in Scotland does not have anything in tartan. Reedware is such a staple of rural Sri Lankan culture that a reed mat is not just a mat. It?s a Sri Lankan folk opera in three acts; harvesting the reeds, the weaving of the mat and life on the woven mat, traditional four-line stanzas specific to each stage serving as the opera?s arias. How does the national handicrafts retailer turn its back on all that and proceed to stock up with non-handicrafts? Isn?t it aiding and abetting in a death, which they are mandated to prevent?? ?
Alias who counts 37 years at Laksala also remembers a time when quality control procedures were an integral part of Laksala?s purchasing process. From 1960s right up to 1990s officers with expertise in different handicrafts and materials would oversee the purchasing process and make sure Laksala only bought merchandise conforming to the standards
?Handicrafts are a dying sector,? a highly placed official of the Laksala?s Finance Division responded incognito. I had asked him if their strategy of giving shelf space to non-handicraft stock will force Laksala?s main objective - showcasing SL handicrafts ? into a backseat. ?We are no longer the Sri Lanka Handicrafts Board. We are now in the State gifts and souvenirs category. We aren?t limited to handicrafts, but we haven?t excluded them either. Still more than 80% of Laksala merchandise are handicrafts,? Laksala?s Director Sales, Kelum Jayawardhana said.
Alias begs to differ and gives me a long list (published as a separate box story) of handicraft goods that used to be bestsellers and are now absent at Laksala. Sena Kalehewatte, former director of the National Crafts Council, former active subcommittee member of Laksala and associate bodies, and award-winning craftsman supplier of bamboo handicrafts to Laksala for 42 years, is scathing about Kelum Jayawardhana and his claims: ?According to the ?82? constitution of the National Crafts Council, there are 35 varieties of handicrafts in the island made from indigenous raw materials. Not even 10 are present in Laksala now. They sell underwear, slippers, oils and cosmetics. Fifty percent of the goods sold at Laksala contravene the National Craft Council Constitution.?? ?
According to Laksala CEO, Ali Ahlam Nawaz, certain prestigious and evocatively Sri Lankan non-handicraft brands have been admitted into Laksala on a consignment basis in order to keep Laksala alive for the craftsmen. A very lucrative line in corporate souvenirs is also developing, he adds.? ?
Deserting traditional crafts? ?
Alias tells me that Laksala owes its suppliers- the craftsmen producers - and they are deserting not only Laksala, but their traditional crafts as well. ?The best brass lamps were made by Karunaratne. He is no longer making them. He has gone into making stainless steel handrails for stair cases?? ?
The incognito high finance official, who feels that handicrafts are a dying sector, remarked that they have a corporate social responsibility to keep Sri Lankan handicrafts alive. All the stratagems have been introduced to enable Laksala to operate in the black and execute this responsibility.? ?
?Earlier [under the previous management], the [non-handicraft] products we sold, we brought under our brand,? recounts my incognito finance official. He is referring to the practice introduced under the former Laksala Chairman Anil Koswatte, of acquiring custom-made for Laksala merchandise from reputed Sri Lankan brands such as Dankotuwa, Noritake, P.G Martin, to be sold rebranded with the Laksala logo. According to Alias, Assistant Merchandising Director, this really worked ? for example a certain porcelain brand used to claim that their gold and silver sets priced at Rs. 50,000 were hard to sell in their own showrooms, but the same sets, priced twice as much and branded as Laksala, would sell- such was its brand equity. Moreover, when teas by various Sri Lankan producers were sold under the Laksala brand, exotic packaging made of woven reed would be used. This helped to promote Sri Lankan handicrafts at the same time.? ?
According to my incognito source high up in Laksala finances, they got stuck financially due to the ?Ape-Gama? situation (Certain buildings and outlets constructed by Laksala using money borrowed from a State bank, and earning revenue for them at ?Ape-Gama? were taken over by the Ministry of Education merely with the instruction to Laksala to get their money from the Treasury, which they have so far failed to do). ?We didn?t have much money to bring in stock, so what we thought was, why not give the authority of bringing in stocks to some other party, so that they will be answerable to the stock. When the stocks are running out, they will put in new stocks.
Also, we don?t have to pump in money. I thought that would not work at first, but it has worked. From a financial perspective, our working capital is not held up and we are revolving other people?s money and stock. Also, aren?t we getting a rent too?? He is referring to the new practice under the present Government, of renting out the first floor of the premium Laksala outlet at Thummulla to non-handicraft vendors to sell their merchandise under their own brands.? ?
Rent? Alias asks explosively ?You call that a rent, Rs 25 000 for 50 Sq feet at a premium location like the Thummula Laksala? It?s?highly suspicious?? ?
?Is the rent enough?? I asked my incognito finance source. ?It?s a pilot project,? he replied by way of rationalizing the low rent. ?And if they want to delegate the authority of bringing in stock to other parties, why not choose parties that can bring in handicraft stock?? Alias asks with justifiable indignation.? ?
It is obviously one of those situations where multiple narratives exist and you feel empathy towards almost all of them. But, the story has a core which everyone seems to miss. The first clue that pointed towards the missing core came from CEO Ali Ahlam Nawaz himself. Was it true, I asked him, that Laksala recently paid for a consignment of handloom sarees and sarongs from Baticaloa that had less than the number of threads per inch demanded by the standard and there were grumblings from the supply department, about buying stocks that would not sell? These women, replied the CEO, weave while doing their domestic chores and Laksala buys from them to encourage and grow the sector.? ?
Getting into trouble? ?
A sector however grows through the development of strong brands. A strong brand is made when people are focused on producing high worth merchandise that could be mega earners and new market grabbers. A sector gets into trouble when its custodians start thinking of it as a dying sector, when they think of maintaining the sector as CSR. They would sacrifice brand equity and let in substandard goods in the mistaken belief that it will sustain the sector; only to end up eventually with a poor, little, dead sector that couldn?t pay for its own retail space and has to be propped up with ?higher?,?non-handicraft merchandise.? ?
Are handicrafts a dying sector? The fact is, it could die or thrive depending on the quality of the entrepreneurial talent the sector attracts. Take textile weaving by handloom. That handicraft subsector can show operatives at both extremes of the success scale. Nobody wanted to wear Salusala?s handloom textiles, and it soon closed down. Fashionmarket.lk - an ecommerce platform where designers and traditional craftspeople collaborate - on the other hand, exports handloom and batik sarees made by traditional weaving villages of Sri Lanka to India. Time was - not that long ago either- when no Sri Lankan sari could compete with Indian sarees even within Sri Lanka, let alone in India.? ?
I asked Linda Speldewinde who founded Academy of Design and fashionmarket.lk, what makes her model work?? ?
?Our model works because it?s kind of an end to end solution. It?s like a fully integrated eco system. When you tell craftsmen to make something, and only reimburse the money to them when it?s sold, then you are not taking ownership of the product. But in our case, because they are investing in the product, we make sure that it works so the craftsman doesn?t have any risk.?? ?According to Linda, ?making sure that it works? involves, moving beyond a retailer and becoming a brand developer. In that process they have become much more than an end-product purchaser to the craftsmen.? ?
?We are giving them the design or whatever, hoping to buy the finished product back. That in itself takes away some risk, they are not making stuff they can?t sell. So the first thing is, everything they make is bought back.?? ?
This is possible owing to the fact that these weavers and craftspeople have taken part in making a Fashionmarket brand. Everything from the design to the finish and the size of the consignment has been directed by fashionmarket.lk, based on their market assessments?and projections.? ?
?The second thing is,? continues Linda, ?even when our designers go to the villages and work, one of the things I tell them is that the whole livelihood of these people depends on it. So, you can?t be playing around with a sample here and a sample there. It needs to work properly, you need to think that particular design is going to generate an x number of sales to sustain?the artisans.? ?
?One other reason it is working is, we are thinking of the craftsman as a person and we have a very good rapport with them. Our designers go to the villages and sit with the weavers, hence they know who we are and we know who they are. They are not just suppliers. You are sitting with them, you are looking at their income this month, what are they going to make next month, you are sort of mapping out their whole livelihoods for them, to make sure they can sustain themselves with this work. It?s not like you work one month and sit idle the next month. There is commitment.?? ?
As Linda explains, moving away from the basic and uncertain method of paying craftsmen if their consignment sells, as it sells was a natural consequence of their business model. If Fashionmarket, depending on their knowledge of market preferences, decide on a product-line to be developed and then go to the village and direct artisans to make that product-line, naturally they need to take ownership of that product-line and assume the responsibility of selling it.? ?
Workshops? ?
Alias recalls the last time that kind of involvement in the making of crafts was seen at Laksala, ?I remember, in 2001, when we had a Chairman called Srimanie Wickremesinghe, we used to go out to, Habarana, Polonnaruwa, Trincomalee, to our centres there and stay for two or three nights. A designer- Seneka de Silva went with us and we held workshops for the crafts people. We?d suggest new colours and patterns for their, masks, pottery animals and for the rata peduru and tell them to make about four pieces of the new designs and bring to the next session. We had a lady who wove reed mats. We?d see if the new suggestions would work and if they didn?t we?d make something else. This continued even after the Government changed in 2001 and the comrades Lal Kantha and Sunil Handunnetti took over- they were for this process. But when Soma Kumari Thennakoon came under S. B Nawinna, it was abruptly discontinued with.?? ?
Also according to Alias, Laksala is no longer interested in establishing if a supplier is a traditional craftsman or not. ?Earlier, a Laksala officer would visit the village of the potential supplier to see if he was an active, traditional craftsman. Now for all we know, the suppliers could be getting their wares made in China.?? ?
Alias who counts 37 years at Laksala also remembers a time when quality control procedures were an integral part of Laksala?s purchasing process. From 1960s right up to 1990s officers with expertise in different handicrafts and materials would oversee the purchasing process and make sure Laksala only bought merchandise conforming to the standards. Officers with expertise in brass would for instance check the brassware to check if the component metals were present in the accepted percentages, if the brass utensils and lamps had the proper standing balance, whether the Buddha statues had the correct volume and facial proportions. When these officers with expertise retired, a new batch was not hired and the quality control just fell into abeyance.? ?
According to Alias, Anil Koswatte tried to shake Laksala into revenue making mode by introducing extensive reforms. He nurtured Laksala?s own brand by accommodating multiple non-handicraft merchandise under the umbrella of the Laksala brand. However, Sene Kalehewatte, recalls a telling difference in the way the two types of merchandise, handicraft and non-handicraft were treated.? ?
?Only merchandise supplied by craftsmen producers can be sold in Laksala anyway, according to the agenda. Anil Koswatte would buy large consignments of goods such as porcelain from largescale manufactures to be sold on 10 to 20 % commission. Three to four, at times even 10 to 15 hundred thousand rupees worth of non-handicraft goods would be bought in one go, on immediate payment. Meanwhile they would buy Rs 25 000 worth of goods from craftsmen and pay them in five installments. Many craftsmen left Laksala.?? ?
These developments highlight the power gap between the handicraft and non-handicraft merchandise. If, into your prime retail space located in the heart of tourist commercial activity - space that is supposed to be reserved exclusively for handicrafts ? you invite ?higher? merchandise, to bolster up the poor little handicrafts, naturally the ?higher? merchandise would get VIP treatment.? ?
However, the ?poor little handicrafts? can be developed into highly coveted, mega buck earning, collectors? merchandise. For that you need vision, quality control systems, design expertise and entrepreneurial talent, missing ingredients from Laksala at the moment.? ?
We are no longer the Sri Lanka Handicrafts Board. We are now in the State gifts and souvenirs category. We aren?t limited to handicrafts, but we haven?t excluded them either. Still more than 80% of Laksala merchandise are handicrafts
-Kelum Jayawardhana
Our model works because it?s kind of an end to end solution. It?s like a fully integrated eco system. When you tell craftsmen to make something, and only reimburse the money to them when it?s sold, then you are not taking ownership of the product. But in our case, because they are investing in the product, we make sure that it works so the craftsman doesn?t have any risk

Traffic tickets to personal addresses - Sagala
	
Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka today said the Police will launch a pilot project in February to send traffic tickets to personal addresses of traffic rule violators.
The Minister addressing the officers of the Police Traffic Unit, said the new technology would be introduced to assist Traffic police officers in their day to day work, the ministry said in a statement.
"We all know how they run into difficulties while performing their day to day work. Some even abuse police officers verbally when they try to take action on traffic rule violators. Their videos go viral on social media. All this can be avoided if we use modern technology for the benefit of traffic Police officers who perform their duties despite many hardships," the Minister explained.
The Minister added that a traffic ticket would also come with a photograph of the traffic rule violation as evidence and an explanation of the offence. "If the vehicle owner thinks he is not guilty, he can present his argument in courts," Ratnayaka said.
"I also instructed the IGP to take necessary measures to pay an allowance to traffic police officers working under difficult conditions. A portion of the money we collect from fines can be allocated for this. I will present a Cabinet paper seeking approval in this regard," the Minister said.
The event was organised to give a basic first-aid training to traffic police officers. It was held with the support of the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society.
The Minister said first-aid training to Police officers would help reduce the number of deaths caused by road accidents, on a daily basis.
"Some deaths occur because those who take road accident victims to hospitals use wrong methods. This happens mainly due to unawareness. That is why decided to give a basic first-aid training to Police officers. Tuk Tuk drivers too will soon be given a similar training," Ratnayaka added.

US revamps travel warning system; SL gets an okay
	
The United States revamped its warnings about the risks of traveling to other countries and Sri Lanka is listed among countries that the lowest advisory level for safety and security risks in the new four-point safety ranking system.
Accordingly, Sri Lanka is listed as a Level-1 country which means ?Exercise normal precautions when traveling to Sri Lanka?.
However, neighbouring India and Maldives were listed as Level-2, ?Exercise increased caution.? ?
For India, it states, ?Exercise increased caution in India due to crime and terrorism. Some areas have increased risk?, while for Maldivesits, ?Exercise increased caution in Maldives due to terrorism.?
Among the other countries in Level-1: ?Exercise normal precautions? are Australia, Singapore, Brunei, Sweden and Switzerland.Level-1 is the lowest advisory level.
The United States unveiled the new system on Wednesday (Jan 10), along with an interactive world map to warn its citizens about the dangers of foreign travel.
AFP reports that some countries have complained in the past that the travel warnings exaggerate dangers and damage tourism, or suspect they have been subjected to a US diplomatic rebuke.
Ten war zones and failed states are ranked Level Four, "Do Not Travel": Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
North Korea is also Level Four, with the additional restriction that US law prohibits American travelers from using their passports there, effectively banning visits.
However, each warning is accompanied by a country page on the travel.state.gov website, explaining what specific threats have been identified and why the advice has been given.
Major European allies like Britain, France and Germany are Level Two, "exercise increased caution," while authoritarian Uzbekistan gets Level One, "exercise usual precautions."
But Cuba is ranked only Level-3, "Reconsider Travel."
The United States itself is not rated in the new system.
Four-point safety ranking system
Level 1 -Exercise Normal Precautions: This is the lowest advisory level for safety and security risk. There is some risk in any international travel. Conditions in other countries may differ from those in the United States and may change at any time.
Level 2 -Exercise Increased Caution: Be aware of heightened risks to safety and security. The Department of State provides additional advice for travelers in these areas in the Travel Advisory. Conditions in any country may change at any time.
Level 3 - Reconsider Travel: Avoid travel due to serious risks to safety and security. The Department of State provides additional advice for travelers in these areas in the Travel Advisory. Conditions in any country may change at any time.
Level 4 -Do Not Travel: This is the highest advisory level due to greater likelihood of life-threatening risks. During an emergency, the U.S. government may have very limited ability to provide assistance. The Department of State advises that U.S. citizens not travel to the country or leave as soon as it is safe to do so. The Department of State provides additional advice for travelers in these areas in the Travel Advisory. Conditions in any country may change at any time.

101-year-old woman from Wanchawala still strong
	
By G.W.K. Premathilaka??
A woman aged 101 years is still fortunate to walk steadily without the aid of a walking stick. She is also able to attend to her personal needs of cleaning, using the washroom and other personal sanitary needs without being helped. This woman, Sopinona, lives in Aluthwatta, Kalahe, Wanchawala.??
She was born on 11.12.1917. She is the eldest in a family of two daughters and had entered wedlock on 10 August 1944 when she took the hand of A.Thelikada Palliyaguruge Saradiel, a trader by profession.??
Being the mother of three sons and two daughters Sopinona has lived happily with her husband until he died in 1965.??
Now she is a proud great grandmother of 21 grandchildren. There are 8 in the third generation and 13 in fourth generation. At present she lives under the care and protection of her younger daughter P.P.G. Priya Premelatha (62) and one of her sons P.P.G. Mahendra (58).??
This elderly mother was so eager, in presence of her children, to narrate about her life story to us.??
Her voice is still very clear, given her old age.??
?Until very recently I observed sil on Poya Days. I am very fond of reading and read any book I can find. I have recited the discourse of Pirith several times. I even read newspapers specially Lankadeepa with interest.??
?Jackfruit and breadfruit are my favourites. Mango is my favourite fruit.??
? Years ago I was a good lace knitter and engaged in it as a domestic industry,? she said recalling the years gone by. Her stories convince us of the energy she possessed, in her youth.??
Sopinona?s youngest daughter Premalatha seemed greatly pleased when she spoke of her mother. She said they (members of the family) do not have to spend much time attending to her as the mother is still capable of doing her work without others? help.??
They have also recently celebrated their mother?s birthday.? ?
