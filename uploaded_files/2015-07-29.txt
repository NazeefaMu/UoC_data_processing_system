Mastermind of SL team attack in Lahore killed
	
The alleged mastermind of the attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in 2009 in Lahore was killed in an attempted breakout from police late on Tuesday, along with his sons and 11 others, Pakistani media have reported.
Malik Ishaq, who heads the banned Sunni extremist outfit Lashkar-e-Jhangvi is responsible for attacks on Shia Muslims and was also the alleged mastermind of the attack on the Lankan cricket team in which 8 Pakistanis were killed.
Ishaq and his two sons had been arrested last week and taken to Punjab's Muzaffargarh district for recovery of weapons, and while they were returning on Tuesday, militants attempted to free them by opening fire on security forces, Dawn reported.
The gun battle left the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi chief and his sons dead along with 11 militants, while one police constable was killed and six police officers were injured.
On Tuesday night, about 15 militants opened fire on the police vehicle carrying Ishaq and his sons, and managed to escape with them on motorcycles, Dawn reported, citing an official from the counter-terrorism department.
However, the fleeing militants were met with another police party that had been informed of the attack, and a gunfight ensued between them.
The militants, including Ishaq, were killed in the encounter.
Police found several explosives and weapons such as suicide vests, hand grenades, Kalashnikov rifles, pistols and magazines on the militants.
Lashkar-e-Jhangvi had been banned in 2001 by former President Pervez Musharraf. It is said to be affiliated with the Al Qaeda.

This ambitious guy, a well-heeled dual citizen of this country and Britain, ?now living in the mid-east ?had sought nomination from King Rooster to contest the coming poll as a cockerel from the hills. For King Rooster this was a godsend opportunity to raise enough dough to fund his election campaign. ?OK, I will nominate you for one of the slots from the quota reserved for our party on the Betel leaf district lists.

A Betel leaf secretarial one had to answer an unexpected telephone call the other day. ?The caller was a garrulous party politico hailing from an area once well known for oranges. The man incurred the wrath of the rebel group when he declared in public soon after January 8 that, ?Appachchi (father) is dead. There?s no sense in carrying his dead body around??
He did not mind getting distanced from the rebel group at that time, because he apparently thought his closeness to the new Big Boss would secure his political future. However, the poor man found himself between two stools when his new mentor washed his hands off the Betel leaf poll campaign.
The secretarial one sounded ready to listen to him and the politico poured out his heart: ?Aren?t we all in a terrible mess, Boss? ?When Appachchi died we had the consolation that Bappachchi (step father) was there to look after us. But now he too is gone! What are we to do now?? The secretarial one decided to console the crestfallen politico: ?Don?t get disheartened. We can win this election. After all, your district is a stronghold of ours. So there is no reason for you to worry.?
Now the politico is reportedly going round the district displaying the cutouts of Appachchi and singing his praises! ?

Investigators question LTTE operative on links to outfit
	
	Investigators of the 'Q' branch police on Tuesday interrogated LTTE operative A Kumaraguru, who police arrested at Trichy airport on July 25 when he attempted to flee to Switzerland with a fake passport.
	Officers of the police's special anti-terror wing said they questioned Kumaraguru ? an active operative of the LTTE till the Sri Lankan Army destroyed the outfit with the killing of its chief Velupillai Prabhakaran in May 2009 ? about his links to an arrested member of the rebels, Krishnakumar, and his associates in Ramanathapuram.
	Police arrested 39-year-old Kumaraguru, originally from North Jaffna, when he attempted to board a Malaysia-bound flight in Trichy last Friday. He told police that he planned to leave to Switzerland from Malaysia.
	Investigators said Kumaraguru lost his right leg in the civil war in Sri Lanka and used a prosthetic limb. Kumaraguru and his wife Sudharsini arrived in Chennai in 2014 and lived in Choolaimedu, where a member of a Tamil outfit gave them shelter.
	A team led by superintendent of police K Bhavaneeshwari questioned Kumaraguru on his haste to leave India and its connection to the arrest of Krishnakumar and his accomplices Rajendran and Sai Kumar.
	The team also questioned Krishnakumar, Rajendran and Saikumar, who were arrested with 75 cyanide capsules and 300 gm of cyanide powder, four GPS devices, mobile phones and Indian and Sri Lankan currency. Krishnakumar has admitted to police that he was one of Prabhakaran's secretaries.
	Police arrested Kumaraguru's accomplice Thirumurugan and have launched a search for another aide, Mubarak, in Chennai. (Times of India)

Land grab to shatter the dream of poor peasants
	
There is a state-owned land about 300 acres in extent in Hewaheta area. Once a luxuriant tea plantation, this land, after years of neglect has turned into a veritable moor.?
Some time ago, the authorities decided to distribute this bare land among the peasants in the area for farming and applications for allotments from this land were called from prospective cultivators.?
And the applicants were eagerly looking forward to the day they could get a piece of land to raise some ?crop which would bring them ?hope for a better future for their children.
Alas! Certain moves afoot now, they say, are destined to shatter the dream of the poor peasants in the locality.?
According to latest reports, a certain powerful lady now back in the political scene as large as life wants 100 acres from the land allotted to her cronies while a Ministerial one commanding much political clout wants another 100 acres from the land reserved for his henchmen.?
Going by the developing situation, no peasant in the area is likely to get an inch of land from the 300-acre spread, they say.?

	?I have not done anything to be hooted at as I have only engaged in clean politics. If people hooted at me, media will report that the public hooted at me, not that it was a planned action by several individuals. There are several candidates who will do whatever it takes to win,? he said. ?

The fracas that broke out at the Sri Lanka-Pakistan ODI held at the R. Premadasa stadium recently drew condemnation from cricket fans across the world. The fact that the ugly scene played out in the presence of a distinguished guest like the head of the ICC ?increased in no small measure the embarrassment and chagrin caused to the cricket authorities in particular and the country in general.?
Police and army personnel who rushed to the scene nabbed six youth involved in the free-for-all. ?Police had also collected a bonus when they succeeded in rounding up 11 drug addicts who had been either smoking or sniffing the stuff while watching the match.
Even before the Police ?party could reach the Police station with the drug puffers ?and ??sniffers? taken into custody, the OIC had received a call from an influential politico requesting that ?one ?particular addict among the ?11 ?arrested be released forthwith.
Police following inquiries found the youth that the politico wanted released hails from a leading business family.
Pressure on Police to release the particular addict had increased as they proceeded with formalities to prosecute the 11 drug addicts. The drama reached an anti-climax when the former Sri Lanka Cricket Chief who called at the Police station at midnight secured the release of his son. ?

The diplomats present had assured the President of their fullest support and promised to assist the initiatives of the government to address the problem.
Representative of the World Health Organisation (WHO) assured the President that they would provide assistance towards finding the causes for the disease and formulating a lasting solution while the representative of the European Union (EU) said that they would consider increasing funding for drinking water projects around the country.
Indian High Commissioner Y.K. Singha, who was also present on the occasion, assured all those present that India would also do their part in providing assistance for the drinking water projects in Kundasale, Polgahawela and Kalutara.

Taliban leader Mullah Omar 'is dead'
	
Taliban leader Mullah Omar has died, Afghan government sources say, but the militant group has not commented, the BBC reported. ??
The reclusive leader died two to three years ago, Afghan government and intelligence sources said. No further details were released.
A Taliban spokesman contacted by the BBC said the group would issue a statement shortly. There have been several reports of Mullah Omar's death in the past.
However, this is the first to be confirmed by top sources in the Afghan government. Mullah Omar led the Taliban to victory over rival Afghan militias in the civil war that followed the withdrawal of Soviet troops.
His alliance with al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden prompted the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington.
Mullah Omar has since been in hiding, with a $10m US state department bounty on his head. Over the years, the Taliban have released several messages purported to be from the fugitive leader.

In the first six months of a UPFA government that was to be formed in the event of winning the August 17 poll, the Parliament would be turned into a Constitutional Assembly to introduce a new Constitution and electoral reforms, General Secretary of the UPFA Susil Premajayantha said.
Premajayantha, who is contesting from the Colombo District, told the media at the SLFP head office that all unfair acts, layoffs, transfers and other punishments, evictions and ill treatment on UPFA and SLFP supporters allegedly committed since January 8 would be reversed and justice would be done within two weeks of office by a UPFA regime.
?We will restart all development projects small, medium and major, suspended by this government in the first week of coming to power and re-instate all 70,000 employees, who have lost their jobs who served under those projects.
?We will reopen the Central Bank bond issue scam and expose all those who have allegedly involved in the controversial transaction. We expect to attend to all these remedial measures as a priority before we really spring into action to implement our development and restructuring programmes on the economy, trade, industry, foreign policy, education, environment and health,? Premajayantha stressed.
He said following the UPFA manifesto titled A Guarantee to the Future under the slogan Let?s Power the Country ? Let?s Start Afresh, which was launched on Wednesday at the Hendry Pedris Grounds at Havelock Town, the new UPFA government will treat the private sector as the engine of growth, while strengthening the State sector to create a level playing field in order to give the best.
?Our manifesto is youth oriented. Therefore, we have decided to provide maximum possible benefits from a future UPFA government to those who have failed GCE O/L through A/L vocational training, low interest loans and job placements after they complete their skill enhancing training. We will also give soft loans to graduates until they find a job and bursaries to University students will be increased,? he stressed.
Premajayantha said all illogical and unfair taxes imposed by the government in the last six months would be removed.
For instance, the tax imposed on hybrid motor cars would be removed and import of hybrid vehicles would be encouraged to minimise emissions.
Housing loans of up to Rs. 4 million with subsidized interest rates will be offered to tenants, newlyweds Rs.50,000 will be paid for women selected from all districts in the country to engage in successful self-employment. They will be offered interest-free loans upto Rs. 50,000 and low interest loans from Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 200,000.
Pregnant mothers and feeding mothers will receive milk, eggs, fruits and Thriposha. The allowance of Rs. 100,000 granted to armed forces and police families upon the birth of the 3rd child will be increased to Rs. 200,000.
Education up to GCE Ordinary Level will be made compulsory for all children.
Interest free loans will be provided via state banks to university students and all students who sit for G.C.E (A/L) examination to purchase a computer. A monthly allowance of Rs. 5,000 will be given to all preschool teachers, while an interest free loan up to Rs. 50,000 will be granted to all government approved preschools to purchase teaching equipment.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

US wants military bases in SL: Vitharana
	
Recent statements made by an incoming ambassador of the US to the region and a high ranking military official of the US indicated that the US intended establishing military bases in Sri Lanka, leader of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) Prof. Tissa Vitharana said.
?The senior military official in charge of South East Asia and the ambassador have publicly said that they intend on including Sri Lanka in its security ring in this part of the region. This is nothing but a clear indication that they want to establish a military base,? he said.
Speaking at a press conference attended by Udaya Gammanpila and General Secretary of the Communist Party D.E.W. Gunasekara, Prof. Vitharana said that the United National Party was in agreement for a US military base.
?The UNP seems to have come into an agreement with the US regarding this because the statements have made recently anticipating a UNP win and following the last election. There were secret agreements in 2002 when they came into power and there is a good chance that such agreements have been drawn now,? he said.
He said that the Left and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) fought for the removal of the British Army following Independence and the UNP was taking the country back to imperialist forces.
Prof. Vitharana said that the call for federalism by the Tamil National Alliance had also fuelled racist elements in the South.
?We are displeased and condemn the call for a Federal State by the TNA at this crucial juncture. It has done nothing but fuel racist elements in the south at a time when we all want reconciliation? he said.
He said the election manifesto of the UPFA stated that the LLRC recommendations would be implemented within a year and such was indicative of the UPFA?s commitment to reconciliation. (Sanath Desmond)

While the two main political parties are still trying to manage the after-effects from nomination hiccups, ?inquisitive ones are making inquiries to ascertain why certain popular hopefuls were dropped and some ?hardly known persons had suddenly made their way into the lists at the eleventh hour.
Last minute erasure of the name of popular teledrama actor and TV personality Kamal from the UNP?s Ratnapura district nomination list raised many an eyebrow and the inquisitive ones had found out that the party leadership had heeded a strong protest made by a young PC member well known for his bellicose behavior.
?We have been victims of assaults and other forms of violence and harassment for years. Yet we have stood by the party undeterred. You are now going to give nomination to a person parachuted here ignoring our merits,? the young UNP activist had remonstrated. His protest had the desired effect on the party leadership and Kamal?s name was deleted from the list, they say.
A Kamal?s friend said: ?Kamal initially asked for nomination to contest from Gampaha. But the party wanted him to enter the fray from his home turf Ratnapura. Now he has lost both Gampaha of his choice and Ratnapura of the party?s choice.??
