Assailant in Paris attacks identified
	
French police have identified one of the assailants in the coordinated attacks in Paris as Ismael Omar Mostefai, a 29-year- old French national, and seven of his relatives are being questioned, sources and French media said today.
Authorities had a dossier on Mostefai that marked him as a potential Islamist militant. He also had previous arrest records and had been sentenced eight times for petty crimes, according to French newspaper Le Monde. Mostefai was one of the gunmen who blew himself up in a Paris concert hall where most of the 129 deaths from the attacks late on Friday took place.
His father, a brother and five other people are being held for questioning, several French media reported on Sunday, as the hunt continued for others involved in the shootings. (REUTERS)

MR stresses on global resolve to deal with terrorism
	
	Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa while expressing his condolences to the French government said the ?barbaric act of terrorism perpetrated against ordinary citizens has once again underscored the need for global resolve in dealing firmly with terrorism?.
	In a letter to the French President Francois Hollande, Mr. Rajapaksa said Sri Lanka had suffered the scourge of terrorism for well over three decades and such attacks were commonplace in the country.
	?This is why my government resolved firmly to put an end to terrorism. Today, my country is at peace with no terrorist attack reported since May 2009,? the letter said. ?
	?It is with shock and disbelief that I heard of the terrorist attacks in Paris which has left well over 100 people dead and scores more injured. Only those who have endured the same agony will fully understand what the people of France are going through at this moment,? the letter further said.
	The former President also conveyed his condolences to the families in France and his sympathies to the injured.

SL considers proposal to release 217 Tamils- Ganeshan
	
	The Sri Lankan government is considering a proposal to release the 217 Tamils currently in detention under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), after putting them through a program of rehabilitation, the Minister of National Dialogue, Mano Ganeshan, told The Sunday Standard
	Ganeshan recalled that the Mahinda Rajapaksa government had released over 12,000 LTTE cadres, after subjecting them to a rehabilitation program. He said that the Lankan Security Forces have developed expertise in the rehabilitation of militants, and the facilities at the rehabilitation centers are now of international standard. ?They don?t look like torture centers, as they did in early days,? Ganeshan said.
	But for the time being, the policy is to release the detainees on bail on a case-by-case basis. On November 11, 31 detainees were to be released on bail but since no one came to stand surety for them, the prisoners were sent back to prison. Each released detainee had to have two LKR (Sri Lankan Rupee) one million bonds. They would also be required to report to the Terrorism Investigation Department every other Sunday. They would be barred from leaving the island.

Tropical system to renew flood threat in Sri Lanka
	
	The threat for flooding will be renewed in Sri Lanka and southern India Sunday into Wednesday, regardless of tropical development.
	On the heels of the tropical low that produced flooding in parts of southern India earlier this week, another tropical system is taking shape in the southern Bay of Bengal.
	Due to eventual interaction with both Sri Lanka and India, development into a named tropical system will be hindered though it remains a possibility that a weak tropical cyclone forms before the system tracks into India early next week.
	Slow movement of this system will result in several days of tropical downpours for parts of India and Sri Lanka, elevating the risk for flooding.
	As the system tracks northwestward, rain and thunderstorms will become widespread across Sri Lanka into Sunday, while also advancing into eastern Tamil Nadu in southeastern India.
	From Monday through Wednesday, the danger for flooding downpours will shift westward and encompass much of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and southern Karnataka. Additional heavy rain may also continue to stream into western Sri Lanka, while expanding northward along the coast of Andhra Pradesh.
	Rainfall amounts in excess of 100 mm (4 inches) are possible in Colombo, Chennai and Madurai with flooding downpours possible in Coimbatore, Bengaluru and Kochi.
	Flooding will be the primary concern with this tropical threat; however, localized damaging winds are possible in thunderstorms.
	In the longer range, the system could track into the Arabian Sea where there will be a higher likelihood for development into an organized tropical cyclone.(accuweather)
