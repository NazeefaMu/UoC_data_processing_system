## Title: Commonwealth values an enigma in  Sri Lanka

Commonwealth values an enigma in  Sri Lanka
	

At the end of the 19th Century the British Empire controlled one fifth of the world. Under their reigns they introduced laws that to date criminalize same-sex conduct in thirty six of the 53 countries in the Commonwealth, introducing centuries of Victorian values perpetuating homophobia that has been assimilated in to native cultures as their own values. 
However, during the 2018 Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting the British Prime Minister, Theresa May said that the UK Government deeply regretted the anti-gay laws that were established by the British during the colonial era. The damage caused by these outdated laws and the stigma and discrimination it perpetuates may never be undone, however the expression of deep regret is a necessary step in the hopes of starting conversations for countries willing to abolish these heinous laws and begin to mend the damage it has done for over a hundred and thirty-five years. 

"By signing the Commonwealth Charter, Sri Lanka has committed to these values of equality and respect of all its citizens, which includes the LGBTIQ community"
Being a part of the Commonwealth comes with the responsibility of upholding the Commonwealth values that are an integral part of what the Commonwealth community stands for. By signing the Commonwealth Charter, Sri Lanka has committed to these values of equality and respect of all its citizens, which includes the LGBTIQ community. To be a part of the Commonwealth is to promote respect, tolerance, and understanding of our diverse communities. By understanding that this diversity adds to the advancement of our country rather than its downfall and by showing that all our citizens deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, we could lead the way for more countries to follow in our footsteps. Sri Lanka can be doing so much more to make sure all of its citizens are protected from discrimination. Unfortunately, dropping decriminalization from the National Human Rights action plan in January of 2017 is not the kind of action that instills confidence in the government that it stands for good governance and democracy and the protection of all its citizens sans none. 
As the chair of the Commonwealth Equality Network and the Executive Director of EQUAL GROUND, I believe that all Sri Lankans should be afforded the freedom to live their lives without fear of oppression, violence or discrimination. This includes those who are targeted as a result of their sexual orientation, a group conspicuously missing from the National Human Rights Action Plan. 
Although it is commendable that the government has made certain strides towards the rights of its citizens, especially concerning Transgender persons, it is discouraging that it failed to exclude discrimination spawned by the Penal Code of 1883 that targets consensual same sex activities, failing to recognize Sexual Orientation as a basis for protection against discrimination. Despite the countless recommendations received by the UN, over the years and as recently as November 2017, the Sri Lankan government has neglected to acknowledge the LGBTIQ community as a marginalized group that needs protection and deserves the right to a free life, devoid of criminalisation and discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. Belize, Seychelles and Trinidad and Tobago serve as examples of progressive governments, who most recently, decriminalized homosexuality in their countries. But Sri Lanka still fails to uphold the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Commonwealth Charter whereby all persons are born equal and will be treated equally and with dignity, free of discrimination. 

"I feel, that Sri Lanka chooses to ignore all the contributions LGBTIQ persons have made over the years to our country whether in the Arts, Sciences, also in the Armed Forces and Law enforcement"
It is a bit hypocritical I feel, that Sri Lanka chooses to ignore all the contributions LGBTIQ persons have made over the years to our country whether in the Arts, the Sciences, in all manner of ways, including the Armed Forces and Law enforcement. LGBTIQ persons who serve and have served in the armed forces and in law enforcement are expected to give their lives to protect our country - and have done so during our prolonged civil war - but are unable to live and serve freely as LGBTIQ citizens of this country, are not given the respect and support they so well deserve. The inability of this country and the successive governments that run it, to acknowledge, accept and safeguard its LGBTIQ citizens, no matter how much they have contributed to the betterment of our country, is pathetic and archaic. Hundreds and thousands of LGBTIQ persons flee this country yearly, take refuge in other countries,and give their knowledge, creativity, service and support for the betterment of their adopted country. We as a nation, are poorer for it. 
As a member of the Commonwealth therefore, it is important that the Sri Lankan government commits to the commonwealth values it has signed on to. As Teresa May said at the Commonwealth Joint Forum Plenary at CHOGM on April 17, 2018; 
As a family of nations, we must respect one anothers cultures and traditions. But we must do so in a manner consistent with our common value of equality, a value that is clearly stated in the Commonwealth charternobody should face persecution or discrimination because of who they are or who they love.

Dozens of Palestinians killed as US opens Jerusalem Embassy
	
At least 41 Palestinians have been reported killed by Israeli troops in clashes on the Gaza border ahead of the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem.
Gaza's Health Ministry said that at least 772 Palestinians were also wounded by Israeli fire on May 14.
The Islamist movement Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, has led mass protests over the past six weeks aimed at breaking a decade-old Israeli blockade of the territory. A total of 83 people are reported to have been killed since the start of the protests.
A majority of the territory's 2 million inhabitants are descendants of refugees, and the protests have been dubbed the "Great March of Return" to homes in what is now the state of Israel.
The mass protests were also directed at the transfer of the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on May 14.
Top U.S. officials, including President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump, are attending the event.
In a recorded message at the ceremony, President Trump said he remained "fully committed" to pursuing peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
"Our greatest hope is for peace," he said.
Trump announced earlier this year that the United States would move its embassy to Jerusalem, causing joy in Israel and creating an outcry from Palestinians, U.S. allies, and many other countries worldwide.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked Trump for "having the courage" to keep his promise to move the embassy to Jerusalem, which he called the "eternal, undivided capital of Israel."
Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Abul Gheit blasted as "shameful" the countries that are celebrating the opening of the U.S. Embassy in the divided city.
Iran's foreign minister called the move "a day of great shame."
Trump announced earlier this year that the United States was recognizing divided Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, reversing decades of U.S. policy.
The decision has caused joy in Israel and created an outcry from Palestinians, U.S. allies, and many other countries worldwide.
Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state. Israel has annexed East Jerusalem and declared the entire city as its capital, a move not recognized by the international community. (Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty)

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has written to President Maithripala Sirisena seeking a meeting with him before its token strike on Thursday to discuss the detrimental factors in Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed with Singapore.
GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge said the contents of the agreement had not been disclosed to the Cabinet and the country and that there were regulatory issues in various employment sectors without the necessary safety measures.
The GMOA condemned the Governments decision to sign FTAs with Singapore and the Economic and Technology Co-operation Agreement (ETCA) with India outside a national policy.
Dr. Aluthge said was unfortunate that the foreign consultants preparing these agreements are deciding the countrys fate.
Meanwhile, the GMOA Executive Committee had decided to continue with its work stoppage on May 17 and an indefinite strike if the President failed to intervene.
GMOA Assistance Secretary Samantha Ananda challenged Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama to reveal the truth about the Singapore FTA to the public. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

JAT Paints launches revolutionary new paint using pigment from natural flowers

JAT Holdingsrecently launched a revolutionary new paint, which combines ancient traditions and cutting-edge manufacturing technology. Petal Paint is a unique paint that has been created with the pigments from dried flower petals and transformed into liquid paint using innovation from the Research and Development team at JAT Holdings.
This unique initiative will breathe new life into discarded temple flowers, which are a plenty in the country. Once turned into liquid paint, it will be used in the creation and restoration of sacred Temple murals in Sri Lanka.
JAT Holdings has created Petal Paint as an initiative to pay homage to Sri Lankas rich heritage of Temple art, often found in the form of captivating wall murals in Temple Shrine rooms. Many of the murals are faded and the wall paint available in the marketdoes not always match the traditional colors or texture of wall paint used in the original murals.
We created Petal Paint to give something back to Sri Lankas heritage and culture, says Richard Gunawardene  Head of Marketing at JAT Holdings. Petal Paint combines the best of our traditional culture  the use of pigments from nature  with the most advanced technology in paint manufacturing, to create a paint that matches the traditional temple mural colors and also provides a more long-lasting solution to temple artists.
A section of the temple art that will be restored
Petal Paint will soon be made available to artists working on Temple Murals. The initial colors in the range are Lotus Red, Pigeonwing Blue, Trumpet Yellow, Marigold Orange and Temple Flower White,and will be available in 200 ml tins.
Richard Gunawardene stated that a pilot project using Petal Paint to restore faded murals as well as create new wall murals is currently underway at Sri Sudarmarama Poorana Maha Viharaya, Ganegama, Akuressaand will be unveiled to the public soon. He further elaborated that the ideas were created and conceptualised by Leo Burnett Sri Lanka for JAT Holdings.
It takes around 200 kilograms of dried flowers to make 50 liters of paint, and JAT Holdings will soon launch a public campaign to collect the dried flowers discarded from temples. In addition to collecting the natural pigments needed for Petal Paint production, this initiative will also reduce the daily waste thrown out by temples across the country.
JAT Holdings, one of Sri Lankas award-winning conglomerates, has a strong commitment to sustainable practices and protection of the environment through its products. JAT has introduced several world-class paint and finishing product brands to Sri Lanka.

Lessons of the Iran Nuclear Deal - EDITORIAL
	

In what can only be described as sheer arrogance, on Tuesday May 9, US President Donald Trump announced he was unilaterally withdrawing the US from the international treaty commonly known as the Iran Nuclear Agreement or the Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action (JCPOA), and reimposing sanctions on Iran. 
Further humiliating his European co-signatories and partners who warned against such a decision, the US president threatened sanctions against those who would continue to do business with Iran. Rubbing salt to the wound, and in a show of total contempt for Europes right to formulating its own foreign policy, newly-appointed US Ambassador to Germany warned business leaders that they needed to withdraw investments in and with Iran, or face US sanctions! 
Trump was putting his European partners on notice -their future role within US-led alliances would be that of hewers of wood and drawers of water to their US masters! Using all manner of lies, deception and distortion the US President attempted to paint a picture of why the Europeans needed to follow the US lead in ramping up sanctions against Iran. Using Israeli fake news and outdated documents, Trump attempted to coerce the European nations to follow his lead making out that Iran had reneged on keeping up its end of the nuclear deal. This despite US intelligence sources and the UN nuclear watchdog -the IAEA- vouching that Iran had in fact kept its commitments. 
The US was, through its President signalling a shift back to diplomatic practices of the colonial era -gunboat diplomacy- where the diktat of powerful nations were enforced through armed coercion. In todays context economic might/sanctions. But then, US allies in Europe should not be totally surprised by these events. Even prior to his election to the office of the US presidency, candidate Trump had shown his disdain of Americas allies. 
Under the glare of international media he bluntly accused Americas European allies of not paying NATO bills and implied the US would pull out of the alliance (Atlantic Council Dec 12, 2017), conveniently forgetting the agreement was fathered by the US itself-playing on age-old western European fears of the Russian Bear and its political system - Communism/Marxism - as the eternal enemy of western democracy. 
He accused Europe business leaders of cheating the American people. Though some members of NATO did protest, the US president never withdrew his charges, nor did he apologize for his warped interpretations regarding defence treaties and outright untruths regarding business agreements. The weak-kneed reaction of US NATO partners to President Trumps blatant lies and falsehoods ultimately led Trump into believing he could trample underfoot European... 
In Asia, today we seem to be witnessing a similar drama. Trump is attempting to set Asian countries one-against the other rousing China-phobia in an attempt to draw the Asian countries into the US fold, using disputes in the South China Sea to gain a foothold. Japans present political leadership has forgotten that it is the only country to have suffered a nuclear attack - not from China - but by America itself. And let us not forget the US has not apologized for that crime. 
The countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos et al, who are now being wooed by the US have all been subject to chemical weapon attacks and bombing of civillian targets by the US. What for us in South Asia is the saddest spectacle is to watch India - which once gave leadership to the Non-Aligned nations - seemingly physically and metaphorically embrace US designs in the Asia region. A case in point is the US-India joint naval and other exercises. 
We should understand the US will continue any agreement, only as long as its interests are served. As much as the US is now pulling out of a devastated Afghanistan, abandoned its protege Ngo Dinh Diem in Vietnam, and as it threatens its European allies over Iran today, India too could fall into the same US web of subjugation as other US allies.

Nicaraguas army distances itself from Ortega
	

MANAGUA AFP May13, 2018- Nicaraguas army on Saturday distanced itself from President Daniel Ortega, saying it was not repressing anyone for taking part in anti-government protests which have shaken the Central American nation. 
Unrest against the president exploded in mid-April and has been fueled by a brutal response from police. 
The death toll is now at least 51. 
We have no reason to repress anyone for anti-government demonstrations, army spokesman Manuel Guevara said. We think that dialogue is the answer, he stressed. 
Guevara said the military rejected what he sees as an effort to misconstrue military actions as repression on behalf of the Ortega government. 
Troops are required to protect strategic locations, national assets and national parks, for example.

Petrol can be sold for Rs 90, if taxes removed: Gammanpila
	
A litre of petrol could be sold for Rs. 90, if not for the taxes, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila said today.
There are four taxes imposed on fuel such as Import Duty, Local Tax, Ports and Airports Development Levy and Nation Building Tax, he said.
Addressing a news briefing, he said when the Government increased the price of 1 litre of Petrol to Rs 137 on May 10, average price of crude oil was $67 per barrel in the World Market.
The Rajapaksa Government increased the price to Rs. 137 on September 30, 2011, when a barrel of crude oil was $100. We sold a litre of petrol for Rs. 137 when the barrel of crude oil was $100.
This Government increases the price but when the barrel of crude oil is just $67, Gammanpila said.
MP Ravi Karunanayake correctly pointed out that the Government had to increase the prices of fuel because of the heavy taxes imposed on fuel.
Moreover, President Sirisena has promised to remove all taxes on fuel in Page 28 of his election manifesto in 2015, Gammanpila added.
He asked the Government economic specialists to explain as to why they could not sell petrol at Rs 117, when a barrel of crude oil was $67.(Sheain Fernandopulle)

## Title: Revised Ministerial Portfolios on the Scientific Method

Revised Ministerial Portfolios on the Scientific Method
	
The Daily Mirror of May 2 reported that 18 Ministers were sworn in by the President, following a revision of the Cabinet. The Government or more specifically the President declared that the new revision of the Cabinet, this time, will be on a scientific method. 
Firstly, Presidents statement that it will be this time on a scientific method,is an admission that the past allocation of Ministerial Portfolios was not on a scientific method. That is, it was not on rational criteria based on sound Management principles, but on caprice, political whim and fancy, which is admittedly true. Incidentally, there was another report in the same newspaper, where the MP Udaya Gammanpilla (UG) has said there is nothing scientific in the new Cabinet and that Cabinet portfolios should be assigned not in a scientific manner but in a logical manner.He is toying with words without giving any explanation. It appears that, to UG there is a difference between, what is scientific and what is logical. According to him, what is scientific is not logical, and therefore, it follows that, what is logical, cannot be scientific.This is innovative thinking of Pundit Gammanpilla. But my perception is that anything scientific has to be logical and anything logical has to be scientific. These two ways of thinking are compatible and not antagonistic to each other. Moving away from the digression to Gammanpilla punditry , let me consider the substantive matter of the Ministerial appointments and Portfolios. 
How scientific are the new ministerial portfolios
It would be vain to search for any scientific, logical and rational thinking from our legislators. Most of whom, do not have secondary educational qualification. The scientific methodology belongs to the educated, trained minds in any discipline of study, at a minimum graduate level. Politics is the only profession which requires no educational qualification. What is, needed for politics is only mob appeal and the propensity for vernacular oratory in the idiom of the Mob. 
If it is claimed to be scientific, it requires adherence to basic scientific, logical and rational management principles, which are: 
(a) Affinity 
(b) Duplicity 
(c) Conflict of authority 
(d) Unity or whole 
(e) Bifurcation. 
(f) Strengths, intellect and aptitude of the Appointee. 
From the standpoints of above principles, some ministerial Portfolios, if not all, show evidence of not a deviation from the past, but a repetition of the same capricious, whimsical and the personal, rather than the application of the impersonal principles. 
Breach of the scientific method1. Ministry of Public Enterprise and Kandy Development
The subject of Kandy Development allocated to Minister Lakshman Kiriella and the Southern Development allocated to Minister Sagala Ratnayake, and Wayamba Development allocated to Minister S. B. Nawinna and Northern Development allocated to Minister D. M . Swaminathan conflicts with the Regional Development Portfolio allocated to Minister Sarath Fonseka. It is duplicitous, as it is unqualified ,and implies an all-island Portfolio, not restrictive to any region. This means, the latter is the Minister for development of all the Regions of the Country, unless the Regions are specified. The people have a right to know the regions assigned to him. One cannot expect the people to deductively know that Sarath Fonseka is the Minister for regions other than the regions specifically given to others. Besides, Minister Sarath Fonseka himself will be confused and not certain for which regions, he is the Minster for Development. There is lack of clarity and specificity. Further, one has to assume that Minister Kiriella is responsible for Kandy development only. That is the city only and not the Kandy Region. Can one call this a scientific method 
2. Minister of Social Empowerment, P. Harrison and Minister of Social Welfare, Daya Gamage
On the principle of affinity and unity, these two subjects of Social Empowerment and Social Services, is one integrated whole. This has been bifurcated against all logic and rationality, in an unscientific manner. It is one, substantive function. Ideally Minister Harrison should have been given Social Empowerment, Social Welfare and even including Social Development. Minister Daya Gamage should have been given only Primary Industries, which I assume covers all Industries, including secondary Industries, notably the Apparel Industry. 
3. Minister Sarath Amunugama allocated, inter alia, Hill Country Heritage
Firstly, Hill Country Heritage is vague and ambiguous. Hill country embraces the entirety of the Central Province. It is not a substantive subject, and has no affinity to the subjects, Science, Technology and Research, skills development and Vocational Training, assigned to him. Besides, Heritage is an integral part of Cultural Affairs. On the principle of unity or whole, Heritage rightly belongs to the Portfolio of Cultural Affairs and Higher education, assigned to Minister Wijedasa Rajapaksa. 
Conclusion
The appointment of Sarath Fonseka with vague and dubious subjects like Sustainable Development, and Regional Development, which is more nominal than real, except the only substantive subject being, Wild Life. This particular case exemplifies clearly, it is not impersonal principles, but the adverse personal factor, was the basis for the Portfolio given to Minister Sarath Fonseka is left only with the non-substantive and insignificant Portfolio of Wild Life. This further demonstrates that strengths, ability, capacity not considered, compared to some persons of mediocre talent, being given substantive Portfolios. It is not out of admiration for SF, as a military man, I make this comment. But, he has the capacity and tenacity to get a job done. In this respect, he deserves the more substantive portfolio of Law and Order.
We desperately need a man like SF to bring the big swindlers and criminals, expeditiously, under the arm of the Law. The President and the Prime Minister are fully conscious that SF will accomplish the task given. That is the very reason, he is denied the deserving Portfolio of Law and Order, with the hidden intention to protect the big wrongdoers.

Robot-assisted surgery performed aboard USNS Mercy
	
US and Sri Lankan surgeons conducted the first ever robot-assisted surgery aboard the USNS Mercy recently, US Embassy in Colombo said.
The joint team of multinational surgeons and medical professionals successfully completed a cholecystectomy, or gall bladder removal, on a Sri Lankan citizen using a Da Vinci XI Robot Surgical System.
This landmark surgery advances the boundaries of what is possible through collaboration, skill, and technology, said US Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Atul Keshap. 
We are proud to partner with Sri Lankan medical professionals on this ground-breaking achievement for the international medical field.
Dr. Vyramuthu Varanitharan, a general surgeon at the MuturBase Hospital said this was the first time he ever operated aboard a ship.
It is very stable and doesnt move around. It felt as if I was doing surgery in an operating room in a hospital. It was a fantastic experience to have been able to do surgery on a hospital ship and it is something my team and I will never forget, he said.
Intensive planning and preparation resulted in a smooth and routine surgery. After the successful completion of the surgery, the patient transferred to the Mercys post-anesthesia care unit to recover and was later discharged from the ship in excellent condition for routine post-operative follow up care by Dr. Varanitharan.

Rulers, officials should refrain from corruption
	
If Sri Lankas economy is to develop to the level expected, measures should be taken to keep corruption out of State institutions, former Defence Secretary and the Chairman of the "Viyath Maga" Organisation Gotabaya Rajapaksa said yesterday.
Addressing the annual convention-2018 of the Viyath Maga organisation which was held in Colombo under the theme An Intellectually Inspired Sri Lanka, Mr. Rajapaksa said one of the obstacles to achieve economic growth was State corruption. We should take measures to stop officials from indulging in corrupt practices. Also, it is of paramount importance that we have clean politicians and officials of high calibre in these institutions, he said.
Enumerating on the objective of "Viyath Maga", he said the worlds economy was shifting towards the Asian Region and their objective was to make sure Sri Lankan professionals were prepared for this shift. By the year 2030, China, US, India, Japan and Indonesia will dominate the worlds economy as the five countries which have great economies in the world. Except for the US, the other four countries are from Asia. We are trying to get our professionals, researchers, innovators and entrepreneurs ready for this shift by 2030 and to elevate Sri Lankas economy, he said.
While stating that economic growth is vital, Mr. Rajapaksa said proper education, innovation, profitable investments, efficient management of state resources and social security were needed to achieve a sustainable economy.
He also said people's requirements today have changed and apart from materialistic and cultural aspects they seek to fulfil social and democratic needs. It is vital to respect the equality that exists among communities and to respect the values of each person, he said.
He said the country's economic reforms and law enforcement should go hand in hand. In order to achieve economic growth, the rule of law should be maintained and the law should treat everyone equally. Everyone in the country should respect the Constitution,without going beyond this frame, he said.
He said the economy was not built on policies but on the people who implement these policies. The economy is not about growth capital but about the people who invest the capital. The economy is not based on the statistics of exports but on the people who travel to work daily in buses as well as those who work as farmers or work in factories from 9 am to 5 pm, he said.
Several other speakers including Professor Rohan Gunaratne, Vidya Jyothi Dr. Bandula Wijeratne, Dr. Nalaka Godahewa, Mr. Mano Sekeram, Dr. Ismath Ramzy and Eranda Ginige spoke at the convention.
Former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa, other political leaders, MPs and invitees attended the convention.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

Sanga says no to Pataudi lecture; BCCI still divided
	
Kumar Sangakkara has expressed inability to deliver the annual MAK Pataudi Lecture, the guests and subject of which has become a hot matter of debate among the sections of the BCCI. The former Sri Lanka skipper has told the BCCI that he is pre-occupied with a commentary assignment and cannot be present during the second week of June in Bangalore where the annual event is to be held.
Various communications and email trail shows that Committee of Administrators (CoA) chief Vinod Rai wanted Sangakkara to be finalised to which BCCIs General Manager (Operations) Saba Karim says he has not managed to get in touch with Sri Lanka (till 7 pm on Friday). But Mirror understands that the BCCI eventually managed to reach Sangakkara.
Saba refused to disclose the availability of Sangakkara but according to other BCCI officials, the Sri Lankan would be busy with Sky Sports commentary for the England-Australia ODI series in England. Saba has suggested three other names  Nasser Hussain, Kevin Pietersen and Sourav Ganguly  but understandably, Hussain too will not be available. Well finalise soon, the BCCI officials said.
However, the selection of Sangakkara or the other three has ruffled the feathers of the BCCI members  Amitabh Choudhary has dashed off a missive to the CoA stating none of these names were discussed when they had met.
Unfortunately, when the proposal came there was no mention of any of these past cricketers. As I understand Tiger Memorial Lecture is not an elocution contest and reasonable communication skills are all that we should look for. It is meant to bring to the fore the evolution of the game, what it meant to play for the country in the old days, the hardships of the time, challenges of the future and the like, the acting secretary wrote to the CoA saying, I had suggested we also look for probable speakers amongst distinguished cricketers of yesteryears such as Nari Contractor, Chandu Borde, Erapalli Prasanna and Abbas Ali Baig.
Choudhary, however, said he would be helpless if his suggestion is not respected. As in the past on so many occasions, if overruled, I will have no option but to go with the decision which emerges from these communications, he wrote.
According to the mail, a copy of which is with Mirror, Saba suggested three topics for the lecture: 1) Peace and sustainability through Cricket  relevant since Afghanistan is a wonderful story 2) Behaviour and conduct of international players in the modern age  players perspective and 3) Cricket as an Olympic Sport  way forward  but the BCCI is yet struggling to identify the guest who can be given one of the topics.

Shah Marai: Hope is gone
	
Afghanistan loses its best-known photojournalist
Last weeks suicide bomb attack in Kabul dealt a huge blow to the countrys media sector, killing 12 journalists including Afghanistans best-known photojournalist, AFPs Shah Marai.
Though little known outside the country, Afghanistan has a brave press corps running the gauntlet of suicide attacks by the Taleban and ISIS in Kabul and all over Government-controlled territory on a daily basis. Shah Marai was one of the bravest.
Shah Marai, 41, never left the country though his blind eldest son constantly urged him to do so.
The slain photojournalist comes from a family genetically pre-disposed to blindness. A father of six, he supported a large family including three blind brothers and two blind children. His only daughter Khadija, was born only two weeks before his death.

"Afghanistans best-known photojournalist Shah Marai killed in a suicide attack"
"Shah Marai, 41, never left the country"
Shah Marai started life as a driver for AFP and learnt photography gradually. His bravery became evident when he began working for AFP as a photographer under Taleban rule in 1998. All foreigners were expelled from Kabul in 2000, and the bureau, with Shah Marai as its sole representative, operated discreetly from a house.
He wore traditional clothes when going out and took pictures with a small camera hidden in a scarf. It was dangerous work because the Taleban forbade taking pictures of all living beings, including animals.
One day, as he was photographing people lining up to buy bread, the Taleban questioned him.

"Among those killed alongside was a cameraman, who recently sold his bicycle to buy medicine for his ailing mother... "
He told them he was taking pictures of the bread. Luckily for him, they had no way of checking in those pre-digital days. When news photos were sent out, he signed them as stringer.
Then a few happy years came along as the Taleban were driven out in 2007 and Kabul returned to normal life, with foreigners, including the press corps returning in large numbers.
But he began to despair after the Taleban returned to wage war in the provinces in 2004. In an essay titled When Hope is Gone which he wrote for the AFP correspondent blog in 2017, he said starkly:
There is no more hope. Life seems to be even more difficult than under the Taliban because of the insecurity. I dont dare to take my children for a walk. I have five and they spend their time cooped up inside the house. I have never felt life to have so little prospects and I dont see a way out. Its a time of anxiety.

"Ahmad Sardar, a friend and another AFP journalist, was gunned down with his wife and children inside a restaurant."
There is an incredible ruthlessness about the way the Taleban have targeted those deemed to be their enemies. Ahmad Sardar, a friend and another AFP journalist, was gunned down with his wife and children inside a restaurant. Only one of the children survived. Fifteen years after the American intervention, ordinary Afghans are without money, largely unemployed and live in terror of the Taleban.
But Shah Marai bravely persisted with the job. Among those killed alongside was a cameraman, who recently sold his bicycle to buy medicine for his ailing mother. He was engaged to be married.
A young female radio reporter who died was the sole wage earner for her family, and had just moved to a better-paying job so that she could take part-time university classes.

"There is an incredible ruthlessness about the way the Taleban have targeted those deemed to be their enemies. Ahmad Sardar, a friend and another AFP journalist, was gunned down with his wife and children inside a restaurant. Only one of the children survived"

SLFPs role in East - Reconciliation: 50 years apart
	

At a meeting of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Central Committee chaired by President Maithripala Sirisena, a decision was taken to hold its May Day rally this year in Batticaloa, in the Eastern Province on May 7. A committee headed by Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva was appointed to organize the rally. The idea to hold it in Batticaloa, was based on the results of Local Government election where the SLFP achieved the second place in the district winning 54 members. We believe it is a good proposal as it sends out an encouraging message to relevant groups on national unity and reconciliation. The SLFP which won only a 13% national average and a relatively poor 33% in Presidents home district of Polonnaruwa, did creditably well in Batticaloa receiving 51 % in Kattankudi, 18% in Koralaippattru North and 25% in Koralaippattru Pradeshiya Sabha - It would be interesting to note this in the context of SLFP/UPFA dropping to third and fourth place in the rest of island. 
Whether they went to East for fear of exposure at the hands of Pohottuwa or UNP on May Day; or was it a genuine move in winning the hearts of minority as described above will be left unanswered until SLFPs next move. 
SLFP victory in East: Five decades ago
The partys success at 2018 LG polls in East has a remarkable similarity to its victory 50 years ago, on February 18, 1968, at a bye-election held to decide on a representative for the next two years in the House of Representatives. Kalmunai seat fell vacant with the disqualification of senior politician in the area Mudaliyar, M. S. Kariapper who was found guilty of accepting a bribe. Kariapper had contested this seat at every election since 1947 on a variety of tickets and was returned four times in this Muslim predominated area [68% Muslims; Tamils 28; Sinhalese only 2%]. In 1947, Kariapper contested under UNP and won it. Gate Mudaliyar Mohammed Samsudeen Kariapper who was born in 1899, joined local politics and became chairman of Kalmunai Town Council before he entered national politics. He lost in 1952, but regained it in 1956 under the Federal Party. He won again in 1960 March and at this occasion, he chose Dr. W. Dahanayakes LPP to contest, but soon lost in 1960 July, when he contested under his own new party, the All Ceylon Islamic United Front [ACIUF]. The never-say-die Kariapper was back in the fray at the1965 election, as an independent candidate who beat both his rivals from UNP and FP. Kalmunai with 23,300 voters went to polls to decide on their representative in the legislator. Kariappar was a notable absentee, being deprived of Civic rights for seven years on the recommendation of Thalgodapitiya Bribery Commission. 
The results indicated a clear majority for Sri Lanka Freedom Party candidate, M. C. Ahamed who obtained over 10,000 votes. 
Official Results
M. C. Ahmed  SLFP   10599
Masoor Moulana Federal Party  9345
M. A. L. Kariappa Independent  1237
M. Manickam   TFM   457
Majority     1254
Agriculture is the main livelihood of 90% percent of the people in Kalmunai. Paddy cultivation accounted for over 80% while Tobacco and vegetable covered the rest. 
Mohamed Cassim Ahmed, the new MP for Kalmunaiwas a nephew of M. S. Kariapper. Kariapper family is the most powerful and popular political family in the eastern Sri Lanka. Ahmed contested against his maternal uncle Kariapper in 1960 and won to remain in parliament for 17 years. He was the father-in-law of late M. M. Mustapha, and was also a politician, and a cousin of the late A. H. M. Ashroff, the founder leader of Muslim Congress. Ahmed made his first appearance at the hustings as an independent candidate against his maternal uncle in the March, 1960 election, where he polled only 1280 votes and lost his deposit too. Undaunted he contested the July 60 securing nominations from Federal Party and won with a comfortable majority over uncle Kariapper in a straight contest. The SLFP nominated Ahmed to contest Kalmunai on its ticket at the by-election. 
Leader of the Opposition Sirimavo Bandaranaike issuing a statement on the eastern provinces surprise victory used the opportunity to gain political mileage by arousing communal hatred; she stated, 
The result of the Kalmunai election is of great significance in the present political context, is not just another by-election victory but a victory against a threat to our national integrity and a triumph for a progressive course. The plea for Federalism espoused by the Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi[Federal Party] and encouraged by the present government [Dudleys national] by means of proposed District Councils Bill and other measures to appease the Federal Party leadership has been resisted and strongly resented by the country at all times. In fact its dangers have become more manifest particularly during the three years of office of this government. It was a proud boast built on the false pretences of the Federal Party that it represented the interests of Tamil speaking peoples of Ceylon and that the Muslims of the North and East had entrusted the guidance of their affairs to them. 
Continuing she said, It was also loudly proclaimed by this government that National Unity has been at last achieved by the mere union of the UNP and the Federal Party. [SJV Chelvanayagam led FP, the sole representative of Northern Tamils was in coalition with UNP and five other smaller groups] the Kalmunai results have once and for all blown up both these myths. Poles apart, SLFPs present leader President Maithripala Sirisena addressing the May Day rally made a scathing attack on those arousing communal hatred to gain political advantage. 
SLFP created phobia among Muslims
A White Paper on DC Bill was presented in the House on June 5, 1968 to set up District Councils under the direction and control of the Central Government. One of the main campaign slogans of the SLFP was that the proposed DC Bill in any form at that juncture would be highly detrimental not only to the integrity of the nation but also to the Muslims of both in the East as well as in other parts. The Islamic Socialist Front led by Badiuddin Mahmood, Minister of Education in the Bandaranaike government, contributed in a large measure by successfully convincing the Muslims that they had been long exploited by a handful of self-seeking big names in the community. 
A White Paper published on the orders of the Dudley Senanayake Government and presented by M. Thiruchelvam Q.C., Minister of Local Government and nominee of the Federal Party in the Cabinet for setting up District Councils was abandoned in the face of protests by main opposition SLFP and Sinhala nationalist groups. According to the White Paper, the GA of the District would be the CEO and all staff would be public servants. The DCs would be extensions of the Central Government handling some of the functions performed by the Kachcheries. The Councils constituted in each district, would consist of ex-officio elected MPs for each district, which lay within such administrative districts, Mayors and Chairmen of local bodies within the district, in addition to the three nominated Councilors. 
The SLFP, in a circular to its followers described the Bill as the outcome of a secret pact between the PM and Chelvanayagam, the same way the UNP and the nationalists monks in 1957 chastised a Banda-Chelva secret pact [the B-C Pact of July 26, 1957] mass rallies were organized to whip up opposition to the Bill. It was the second effort by a government, the first being Bandaranaike-Chelvanayagam pact. Thiruchelvam, father of the slain Neelan Thiruchelvam resigned ending the unity of the two parties. Thus ended the second attempt to find a lasting solution. However his son Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam PC, along with Prof. G. L. Peiris, authored Chandrika Kumaratungas devolution plan, also known as CBK-GL-Neelan Package, involving Sri Lanka from unitary state to Union of Regions and merging of the Northern and Eastern provinces. 
Constitutional Assembly and Interim Report
It was generally welcomed both here and abroad, but was attacked not only by main opposition UNP backed by Sinhalese nationalists, but by the LTTE as well. Even the subsequently watered down package was disrupted in the House, burning and tearing copies of it when presented by CBK in Parliament. Thus ended, the third attempt too. Since January 8, 2015 a combined effort was launched by the same two parties under a unity government: instead of finalizing on the interim committee proposals on New Constitution, which encompasses a lasting reconciliation formula, both leaders and their supporters seems to have taken a back seat under severe pressure, concentrating on strategies for Party and individual survival. When the Constitutional Assembly met two and-a-half months ago to discuss the interim report, only six out of the 225 members were present in the House. Time is fast running out; it is imperative that they take the report on priority, and proceed to work on the Draft Constitution. 
On July 29, 1999, a suicide bomber threw himself onto Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvams car near the Kynsey Road-Rosemead Place junction, assassinating him.

25 th Death Anniversary of  the Late Ranasinghe Premadasa: The  common mans President
	
PresidentPremadasa leaving Rastrapati Bhavan after a lengthy press conference. It was packed to capacity with journalists of both the print and electronic media.2.10.1992

Ranasinghe Premadasa was the common mans President. 
Many articles had been written and many had spoken about late President Ranasinghe Premadasa, on his 25th death anniversary, but the writer is the one who covered his entire Presidential campaign islandwide despite all obstacles, the JVP insurrection on one side and the IPKF on the other. 
Late President Ranasinghe Premadasa was truly a common mans President. Never a day passed without his mentioning Magey Dugi Dupath Janathawa. 
After he was sworn in as the President his first task was to find jobs for the unemployed youth.
Summoning big-time businessmen he asked them whether they could find a way to give employment to the poor youth. No response for over a minute, he then said: If you cant I will show you the way. 
That was how the garment industry programme started. 
He requested late Kumara Devapriya to give the start and built the first garment factory in Kurunegala. TriStar Garments of Kumar Devapriya became world famous. That was the start. The President wanted jobs to be given to boys and girls around the locality. 
Thereafter, requests started to come from several companies to start garment factories. Mr Premadasa, known for punctuality and no-nonsense, opened the BOI as a one-stop-shop, where an investor could get all paperwork and ready answers to their questions. 
No postponement of any sort was entertained. No investor complained of any red tape or lethargy at the BOI. 
That was how the 200 garment factories came into being. Not only garments, several other items were made in Sri Lanka. Made in Sri Lanka was found in every shopping mall in Europe. Marks and Spencer shirts sold in the UK were made in Sri Lanka. 

"Late President Ranasinghe Premadasa was truly a common mans President. Never a day passes without his mentioning Magey Dugi Dupath Janathawa"
Journalists in New Delhi once asked the writer, while the latter was in the Sri Lanka Mission, how come Made in Sri Lanka shirts were found in many shopping malls in the UK 
Thanks to the garment industry projects at that time. 
Today how many days does it take to get a job done in a Ministry 
President Ranasinghe Premadasa, when he was Prime Minister visited a remote area for an event. There he saw a little girl in the crowd and inquired why she had not gone to school. The little one said 
Sir, we have only one uniform. One day my sister goes to school wearing the uniform that day I stay at home, the next day I go to school and my sister stays at home.
That made him think over and when he became the President one of the first things he did was to issue free school uniforms to all school children Later on, at his rallies, he said he did not care whether the Colombo schools accepted the free uniforms. He said that he had given them mainly to the children of the poor and the down-trodden.
That is how the free school uniform concept came into being. 
The other important programme of his was the Mobile Service Jangama Sevawa.
He was never in Colombo during the weekends. He was far out in the country holding the mobile service. He took the entire Government machinery with him to the remotest of villages to get the problems of the poor sorted out. 
He did not want the poor people to come to Colombo to get their birth certificates, and identity cards.
He told the officials before leaving on mobile service to be prepared to rough-out for two days. 
The mobile service was an instant hit with the poor people. 
They knew their President was physically present and their grievances could be sorted out. No official would tell a poor man to come another day. 
Mr L.S. Palansuriya, the present Chairman of the NHDA was one of those who had been with President at all these mobile services and would vouch to more than what is written. 

"Sir, we have only one uniform. One day my sister goes to school wearing the uniform that day I stay at home, the next day I go to school and my sister stays at home. "
The writer greeting the newly elected President Ranasingheat Sucharitha.
A few instances covering his campaign might be of some interest.
President Premadasa addressed meetings islandwide despite many obstacles faced not only by him but also the media crew that covered his meetings. 
The then JVP threat on the people not to attend his rallies was a major problem. It so happened at the Rathgama meeting those on stage were Mr Premadasa, Gamini Dissanayake, Lalith Athulathmudali, Ranjan Wijeratne. Mr Sirisena Cooray was seated on a chair by the roadside when the van that the media crew went there was not a single person at the grounds, Mr Premadasa spoke for nearly 45 minutes. 
He said: 
Magey dugi dupath janawata, though not in the ground, will be listening from their homes keeping the doors and windows open. 
He said thanks to the JVP for their threat, otherwise, these poor people would be standing in the hot sun.
He found a solution for the unprotected railway crossings. He wanted the Ceylon Government Railway CGR to employ someone close to the unprotected railway crossings on an eight-hour shift. 
Tell them to have bamboos on either side of the crossings. Later on, those manning the level crossings painted the bamboos to make them colourful and visible. Now they are no more and one hears more deaths at such level crossings.
A lot could be written about what happened during his campaign. 

"That was how the 200 garment factory came into being. Not only garments, several other items were made in Sri Lanka. Made in Sri Lanka was found in every shopping mall in Europe. Marks and Spencer shirts sold in the UK were made in Sri Lanka"
Before concluding I shall relate something that happened when President Ranasinghe Premadasa visited New Delhi. 
He paid a visit to pay homage at the Mahatma Gandhi Samadhi. Whilst he was there Mr Ranga the Indian Express professional cartoonist as was his practice he used to draw a cartoon of any Head of State who visited the Samadhi and get their autograph. 
Now little did Ranga realise that President Ranasinghe Premadasa was himself an artist. Ranga drew the cartoon of the President and showed him. 
The President, in turn, asked Ranga for a piece of paper and his pen and drew Ranga and gave it to him with his autograph.
The following day on page one of the Indian Express they carried Rangas cartoon of the President and the Presidents cartoon of Ranga and titled Ranga meets with his Waterloo. 
Incidentally, my friend and former colleague Late Lasantha Wickrematungas then at the Island newspaper covered Mrs Srimavo Bandaranikes Presidential election campaign, while the writer covered the campaign of Late President Ranasinghe Premadasa.
