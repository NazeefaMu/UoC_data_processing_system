Malaysia's Mahathir Mohamad to become world's oldest elected leader
	
Mahathir Mohamad will become the world's oldest elected leader, after a shock victory in Malaysia's election.
The former PM, 92, came out of retirement and switched to the opposition to challenge his former protege Najib Razak, who has been beset by corruption allegations.
His historic win has ousted the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which has been in power since independence in 1957.
Mr Mahathir said his coalition would "restore the rule of law".
Mr Najib has not yet commented on his dramatic loss.
Official results showed the opposition Pakatan Harapan - the Alliance of Hope - had secured 113 of the 222 being contested, including some which have never before been taken by the opposition. BN took 79 seats.
Announcing his victory in Kuala Lumpur, Mr Mahathir said his coalition had secured "not just a few votes, not just a few seats, but a very substantial majority".
He said he hoped a swearing-in ceremony would be held on Thursday and announced - to cheers among his supporters - that there would be a two-day holiday.
"But there will be no holidays for the winners."
Opposition supporters - most of whom have only ever lived under one government - poured on to the streets overnight in celebration.
"I feel that with this change we probably can see something better in the future," Suva Selvan, a 48-year-old doctor, told AFP.
"Our hope for the future is a better government, fair, free and united."
Mr Mahathir was prime minister, at the head of the BN coalition, for 22 years, from 1981 until he stepped down in 2003.
Under his leadership, Malaysia became one of the Asian tigers - the group of countries which saw their economies expand rapidly in the 1990s. But he was an authoritarian figure who used controversial security laws to lock up his political opponents.
Most infamously his deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, was sacked and accused of corruption and sodomy - and later jailed on the latter charge - when he called for economic and political reforms in 1998.
Mr Mahathir was also a mentor to Najib Razak who went on to become prime minister in 2008, but has faced almost constant allegations of corruption.
He has been accused of pocketing some $700m from the 1Malaysian Development Berhad, a state investment fund he set up.
He has vehemently denied all allegations and been cleared by Malaysian authorities but the fund is still being investigated by several countries. Mr Najib has been accused of stifling Malaysian investigations by removing key officials from their post. (BBC)

N.Korea releases detained Americans
	

REUTERS, 09th MAY, 2018- U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that three Americans detained by North Korea have been released and are on their way home with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Trump said he will greet Pompeo and the Americans when they land at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington at 2 a.m. EDT Thursday morning.
I am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting. They seem to be in good health, Trump wrote in a post on Twitter.
South Korea heralded the move as positive for upcoming talks between Trump and Kim and called on Pyongyang to also release six South Korean detainees. Pompeo had arrived in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, earlier on Wednesday from Japan and headed to its Koryo Hotel for meetings.
The three U.S. detainees being released are Korean-American missionary Kim Dong-chul; Kim Sang-duk, also known as Tony Kim, who spent a month teaching at the foreign-funded Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) before he was arrested in 2017; and Kim Hak-song, who also taught at PUST.

Nude Picasso sells for $115M
	

HINDUSTAN TIMES, 09th MAY, 2018-A Pablo Picasso painting of a teenage nude with flowers fetched $115 million at Christies on Tuesday.
Painted in 1905 during the artists Rose Period, Young Girl with a Flower Basket was estimated at $100 million, the highest presale value among more than 1,500 lots of the Peggy and David Rockefeller collection.
The painting once belonged to Gertrude Stein, the American writer and collector who was friends with Picasso and other artists in early 20th-century Paris. Her brother Leo bought the painting for $30 in 1905, according to Christies.
When the Stein estate came up for sale in 1968, Rockefeller formed a syndicate of fellow Museum of Modern Art trustees to buy it. The estate was estimated at $6.8 million at the time. The members, including William S. Paley, Nelson Rockefeller and John Hay Whitney, agreed to draw numbers from a felt hat to determine the selection order. Rockefeller got the first pick and chose Young Girl.
Earlier in the auction, records were set for artists including Henri Matisse, whose painting generated $80.8 million with fees. Claude Monets water lilies painting sold for a record $84.7 million, topping the $50 million estimate.

SF pledges to resolve issues affecting wildlife
	
Wildlife Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said yesterday he would resolve the issues affecting wildlife in the same manner he ended the 30-year-long civil war. He said this while participating at the ceremony in which Wildlife Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma assumed duties.
The Wildlife Ministry has always had its own, unresolved problems. And following the recent Cabinet reshuffle, the ministry stole the limelight. Nevertheless, I am now vested with the responsibility of resolving burning wildlife issues including the human-elephant conflict. We will immediately look into some of the major concerns like the issues facing national parks including Yala. I will devise an effective mechanism to resolve any human-elephant conflict within 48 hours since it had transpired. Although I have a short spell of one and a half years to achieve all these, I am confident of making it happen, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

SL insists on removal of non-tariff barriers before ETCA
	
The Sri Lankan free trade agreement (FTA) negotiators want India to implement interim remedies for the non-tariff barriers that exist in the current Indo-Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISFTA) prior to the signing of the Economic and Technology Co-operation Agreement (ETCA), in order to build up the confidence on the ETCA among Sri Lankan stakeholders.
Speaking at a recent press conference at the International Trade and Development Strategies Ministry premises, Sri Lankas Chief FTA Negotiator K.J. Weerasinghe said the Sri Lankan negotiating team has taken up several key issues in the ISFTA, particularly with regard to non-tariff barriers on food and processed food exports and the quota on apparel exports from Sri Lanka.
India wants to implement the mechanism after signing the ETCA, however, we are insisting the Indian authorities to implement the measures early, he said.
Weerasinghe pointed out that India currently doesnt recognise the certificates issued for food and process food items by Sri Lanka laboratories, which acts as a major non-tariff barrier for Sri Lankan food and process food exports.
The Indian authorities check each and every consignment of these export shipments to assess compliance with the Indian product standards and regulations at customs.
According to exporters and analysts, the resulting delays, uncertainty and additional costs, such as storage and demurrage, act as a barrier to trade with India.
We want five labs to be recognised by the Indian authorities as an interim measure until the Mutual Recognition Agreement is finalised, he said
A delegation from the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is expected to visit Sri Lanka to inspect the select five labs in mid-May.
They will visit these five laboratories to evaluate the equipment, expertise and capacity and based on those criteria, they will recognise the five labs.
Weerasinghe also said the Sri Lankan FTA negotiation team has taken a strong stance with the Indian negotiators in order to remove the eight million apparel piece quota imposed on Sri Lankan apparel export to India.
We want the apparel quota to be removed. However, the Indian negotiators want to review the quota. We are maintaining the position that it should be removed.
According to local apparel exporters, Lankan apparel exports to India have already reached the imposed quota at the end of 1Q18.
Weerasinghe noted that the removal of these bottlenecks would provide a big boost for Sri Lankan exports to India.
Speaking of the extent of liberalisation of tariff lines to India, he said, One of the important elements of the Indian agreement is the acknowledgement of the asymmetry between the two countries so the extent of liberalisation that India is going to do will not be matched by us.
According to Weerasinghe, Sri Lanka is likely to maintain a 30 percent negative list with India while protecting domestically sensitive industries.
The Sri Lankan FTA negotiators plan to conclude the technical negotiations of the ETCA by the end of the year. The 10th round of the ETCA talks is scheduled to be held in Sri Lanka from May 23-25.
Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan FTA negotiators expect the Sri Lanka-China FTA talks to continue to beyond this year as there is a lot to be discussed with regard to the proposal made by the Chinese negotiators to liberalise 90 percent of tariff lines, where the two parties have to thoroughly discuss the sectors and the timelines of liberalisation.
Weerasinghe said the government has proposed to hold the next round of FTA talks with China in June and Sri Lanka is currently awaiting a response from the Chinese government to continue the negotiations.(Nishel Fernando)

Soul Sounds experiments with Midnight Music
	
Soul Sounds is not an unfamiliar name to Sri Lankan music lovers. Having started out by singing carols in the 1990s, the choir has grown and expanded immensely to the level of continuously bringing fame to Sri Lanka in the international sphere as well. It may well be said that Soul Sounds is the most known and reputed choir in the country. Upon hearing that the choir is attempting something unusual, the Daily Mirror decided to pay a visit to their rehearsing studio and see what they were up to. The unconventional experience the choir intends presenting to you is Midnight Music, a concert to be held at midnight for the first time in Sri Lanka.The concert will be held at St. Andrews Scots Kirk Church in Colombo on May 11th at 11.30 pm. The Music Director of Soul Sounds Soundarie David Rodrigo was keen to unravel not only about Midnight Music, but also about the successful journey and memorable moments of the choir.
Following are excerpts of an interview done with Rodrigo. 
What is Midnight Music about How is it different from other performances done by Soul Sounds
Soul Sounds has always worked hard towards doing things differently, from our soulful gospel music to new pop choral arrangements and folk arrangements. It has been a learning experience putting together different genres of music for a group comprising female singers. Midnight Music will feature more classical repertoire. So I would say that what we are presenting is soothing music, classical in flavor and for the soul. Entrance is free. Soul Sounds is thankful to its exclusive sponsors FAIRWAY HOLDINGS, and DIMO Lanka for enabling them to explore new music and work on different productions.

What inspired you and Soul Sounds to do this concert
One of our lead singers, Shehara Liyanage, had just returned from a trip to Norway. She was inspired by a concert she attended at midnight where there had been similar music. Inspired by this, she shared her experiences with the choir and Soul Sounds, being always ready to accept a challenge, wanted to do something similar. 
How was Soul Sounds created
Soul Sounds was born from the Holy Family Convent Senior Choir that was the first choir to compete in an International Competition in LLangollen Wales, in 2004. Soon upon returning, the girls who were then leaving school wanted to continue with singing and this saw the birth of Soul Sounds. Our first concert was in December 2004 Moods of Christmas and this has continued annually for14 consecutive years. We have since then performed many concerts from different genres, both in Sri Lanka and overseas, with the choir having toured Australia, India, China, France, the USA, UK, Malaysia, Kuwait, and South Africa. 
How have the experiences been while the choir performed at international events
The experiences have been awesome. It has always been a learning experience for us. We have performed to new audiences and also listened to choirs from other countries. I think performing to an appreciative audience and moving people to tears through music and song are great achievements. 
Why is Soul Sounds an all-womens choir
Well, like I said we started off as the choir from Holy Family Convent, which as you know is a girls school. Since then it has just been easier working with women. And this is very subjective! 
You are also a qualified lawyer. What appealed you to become a Music Director
Yes, I am a lawyer, and I specialized in Entertainment Law. I worked at the SAARC Cultural Centre as Deputy Director for 6 1/2 years. During my term, we put together many cultural projects in the SAARC region. I also do freelance research in Entertainment Law, working with my seniors. My passion is music, so it is obvious that I am drawn towards various music projects. I like challenges and exploring new ideas through arts and culture. So music will always remain an integral part of my life. 

Tell us a little about the Soul Sounds Music Academy.
Soul Sounds Academy focuses on educating those who have a passion to learn music and perform. Whilst the academy makes its largest intake in the form of vocal students, we also have classes in piano, violin, guitar, music therapy, musical theatre, individual classes for classical music and pop and rock. Its a place where children are given opportunities not only to learn, but also to perform. We are constantly working towards something. Having studied at the Royal College of Music, it has been my dream to create an atmosphere for music making, where there is a platform not just for knowledge sharing, but also for exploring ones own creativity. The staff comprises experienced and qualified teachers. The vocal department, comprising predominantly of senior and lead singers from Soul Sounds, are taking their own experiences forward helping the next generation of singers. 
If you can briefly tell us how Soul Sounds has influenced your lives 
Soul Sounds is a second family to most of us and it is also our outlet to relieve stress from the daily chores of life. And whilst all of us are engaged in different professions, music has brought us together and kept us bound. There have been challenges, but thankfully we are still together, thanks to the music.The journey has been rewarding and I thank God for the blessings. 

What are the other upcoming events
We have a big POP concert coming up in August and if time allows there would be a concert of local Sinhala and Tamil music this year. Apart from that it would be Moods of Christmas for the 15th year at the Cinnamon Grand in December.

Suicide bombers, gunmen attack Kabul police stations
	

KABUL AFP May9, 2018- Suicide bombers and gunmen launched apparently coordinated attacks on two Kabul police stations Wednesday, killing at least five people, with security forces still searching for several assailants as the city braces for more violence. 
A series of loud explosions rocked the Afghan capital in the late morning and were quickly followed by volleys of gunfire as police engaged in fierce battles with militants. 
The Taliban and Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attacks. But Afghanistans intelligence agency blamed the Talibans Haqqani Network and Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba for both incidents. 
At least five people were killed and 16 wounded in the attacks, health ministry spokesman Waheed Majroh told reporters. 
Two police officers were also killed, the interior ministry said, but it was not immediately clear if they were included in the health ministrys toll. 
After an easing of attacks in Kabul in February, Taliban and IS militants have stepped up raids in the city in recent months. 
IS claimed the first attack on a police station in a heavily Shiite-populated neighbourhood in the citys west, which police spokesman Hashmatullah Estanakzai told AFP had ended.

The fare for the first kilometre in a three-wheeler would be increased by Rs.10 by midnight today, All-Island Three-Wheeler Drivers' Union President Lalith Dharmasekera announced.
He said the decision was taken after the government took a decision to increase fuel prices from tonight.
Three-wheeler fares have not been increased for the last six years and I, as a union leader, was against increasing three-wheeler fares. We charged Rs.50 for the first kilometre which now becomes Rs.60. The cost for the second kilometre is Rs. 40, he said.
The government first let Lankan Indian Oil Corporation (LIOC) increase fuel prices and then let Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) follow suit, he said.
We have nothing left to do except increase the minimum fare. We do not have any support from the government. We earn our living by what we get from our customers. We are sorry for inconveniencing them in this manner, he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Trump accuser scores first-step electoral win
	

AFP, 09th MAY, 2018-A woman who is among some 20 who have accused US President Donald Trump of sexual harassment won a Democratic primary vote for a seat in the Ohio state legislature on Tuesday night, news reports said. If she wins the election in November, Rachel Crooks, 35, who ran unopposed, will become the first Trump accuser to hold elected office.
Her allegation against Trump dates back to 2006, when she was a 22-year-old receptionist at Bayrock Group, a real estate development firm located in Trump Tower in New York.
Crooks, who first made the allegations public before the 2016 elections, said she introduced herself to Trump one day when she saw him standing near the elevators.
She said Trump then kissed her on one cheek, then the other, and talked to her between kisses. 
He also asked her where she was from, she said, or if she wanted to be a model.
He would not let go of her hand and then began kissing her on the lips, she said, according to the Washington Post.
Trump has denied her claims.

Trump ignores European pleas, withdraws from Iran deal
	

President Donald Trump on Tuesday pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, raising the risk of conflict in the Middle East, upsetting European allies and casting uncertainty over global oil supplies.
Trump said in a televised address from the White House that he would reimpose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran to undermine
a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made.
The 2015 agreement, worked out by the United States, five other world powers and Iran, lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program. The pact was designed to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb.
But Trump complained that the accord, the signature foreign policy achievement of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, did not address Irans ballistic missile program, its nuclear activities beyond 2025 or its role in conflicts in Yemen and Syria.
Trumps decision intensifies the strain on the trans-Atlantic alliance since he took office 16 months ago. One by one, European leaders came to Washington and tried to meet his demands, while pleading with him to preserve the deal. By the middle of last week, however, it was becoming increasingly clear to some diplomats that Trump would not be moved.
We felt like we were going through the motions, said a person close to the negotiations.
Even Trumps top aides had not been seeking aggressively to talk Trump out of withdrawing because his mind had been made up, a White House official said.

Trump, Kim Jong Un to meet in Singapore
	
US President Donald Trump will meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12, the US President announced Thursday on Twitter.
"The highly anticipated meeting between Kim Jong Un and myself will take place in Singapore on June 12th. We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!, Trump tweeted.
The summit, which has been in the works since Trump accepted Kim's invitation to meet in March, will be the first ever meeting between a sitting US president and North Korean leader.
US officials had also considered holding the summit at the Korean demilitarized zone or in Mongolia, but ultimately settled on the city-state of Singapore as the location.
The announcement came a day after North Korea released three imprisoned Americans during US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's most recent visit to Pyongyang.
Beyond securing the release of the three Americans, Pompeo also finalized details for the upcoming summit between Trump and Kim.
Trump has struck a cautiously optimistic tone in discussing the prospects of reaching a deal during his upcoming summit with Kim, saying he is hopeful a historic agreement can be brokered while also warning the talks could prove unfruitful.

WHY THE FEAR AND WHEN CAN WE EXPECT ANSWERS 
	

The Cabinet has been shuffled and reshuffled but no one is happy! The burning question is why are they so afraid to give Law and Order to Sarath Fonseka Lets take a look at the Presidents Chief of Staff facing violent corruption charges and sabotage of US$100 MILLION FOR OVER 2 YEARS, MANIPULATION OF DISCARDED MACHINERY SCRAP IRON ETC, AND YET WAS MADE CHIEF OF STAFF! WHAT A HIDEOUS GAFF! Why are all these known corruptions and sabotages set aside and positions of power given to these rogues It smacks of the position of Finance Minister being given to Ravi K! The Heads seem to thrive in having them around! Mahanama and Dissanayake were apparently produced before the Colombo Chief Magistrate and remanded till May 9 pending further investigation. The question here is, despite this knowledge, why were they given such positions of power Who is hiding what I guess we will never know! Mahanama had blocked both projects in regard to the Kantale Sugar Factory. Following negotiations, Mahanama and Dissanayake had agreed to accept the 100 million in installments! Initiate a SCAM and wham, you are in business, or so it seems from things that are happening in this country! Mahanama had purposely thwarted the joint venture undertaken by M.G. SUGARS LANKA (PVT) LTD., AND SRI LANKA FOR REVIVAL AND RESTRUCTION OF THE KANTALE SUGAR FACTORY!

While all the other SCAMS remain unresolved, we have another new one on our hands! But, that is not enough, the price of Milk Powder, Gas and other products have also risen and the beauty of it is they seem to be rising, bit by bit, little by little! Lets not hit the people with all that we are trying to give them, lets do it gradually so they feel how thoughtful and kind-hearted we are!

The Yahalpalana leaders are aware of all that is happening in the country but they dont seem to give a damn! They are only interested in what can be GOT before TIME runs out! Make no mistake, the President who is now saying he will not resign in 2020, is the same man, the very same man, who promised to do away with the Executive Presidency in 100 days! Didnt someone say ABSOLUTE POWER, CORRUPTS ABSOLUTELY! We have a glaring example in front of us today but what are we going to do about it What should we do about it We cant ask them to do the EXEMPLARY THING AND RESIGN, which in reality they should have done long ago! The country is in chaos, the Cabinet is in a bigger chaos, and we seem to be thriving on SCAMS! Why dont the people demand answers People power is what we have, it is our power that put these rogues into POWER which they are now using to their own personal advantage!!! In the Philippines, when the people had enough of the desecration of power, they came out on the streets and threw Ferdinand Marcos out! Absolute unmitigated People Power! Why cant our people do the same here THROW THEM ALL OUT, HAVE A GENERAL ELECTION AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

"Unless we, the people of this country stand up and demand what is our inalienable right, nothing is going to happen. We need to work together as brothers and sisters, as one family, to bring this country to the paradise it was in the days gone by"

Last week, they laid Dr. Lester James Peiris to rest! What a man among men he was, a doyen if ever there was one, yet they had to wait for him to die before they sang his praises! People of the culture, the finesse and men among men that they were, will never grace this country again! All we have are uncultured Yakkos with no education, no culture, no background. To emphasize the immortal words of John Kennedy, we must now say: Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. We must indeed ask what we can do for our country as those who were elected with the sacred trust are doing NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR THE COUNTRY, JUST ONLY FOR THEMSELVES!

We have talked about SCAMS, so many of them, CHILD ABUSE AND THE PUNISHMENT SUCH ABUSE DESERVES, and then we read that a young girl from a Home for Girls has been ABUSED OVER 16 TIMES! WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT IT Why are these maniacs allowed to get away with this What is happening in our Justice System Why does not someone with a spine get up and say COME DOWN HARD ON THESE PERVERTS, GIVE THEM A PUNISHMENT THEY WILL NEVER FORGET; BECAUSE FOR SURE, THAT POOR GIRL, IS NEVER EVER GOING TO FORGET THAT SHE WAS RAPED! Do we do anything NO! Probably send the pervert to jail to live a life of common place luxury, while this poor girl has to live with the horrifying nightmare of THE FACT THAT SHE WAS RAPED REPEATEDLY! It is not a nightmare that will easily go away, so she has to learn to live with it because you see it is imprinted on her subconscious forever! It is not just RAPE that is rampant, MURDERS TOO. Continuously we are told STERN ACTION WILL BE TAKEN! WHEN AND WHERE IT IS A LONG TIME COMING! Forget the politicians, what is the Judiciary about Dont they realize there is no LAW AND ORDER in
the country
 
Unless we, the people of this country stand up and demand what is our inalienable right, nothing is going to happen. We need to work together as brothers and sisters, as one family, to bring this country to the paradise it was in the days gone by. When anyone and everyone could move about freely with no fear, when children went unharmed, when murders took place just once or were never heard of. Selfishness, Greediness, Inhumanity and most of all MANS INHUMANITY TO MAN MUST CEASE, IF WE ARE TO CALL THIS COUNTRY PARADISE AGAIN!

he root cause. People like to throw that phrase around when talking about problems and their resolutions. Its a decent enough proposition, the assumption being that if root causes are identified and fixed, not only will the problem be sorted but its reincarnation, so to speak, would be preempted. 
The problem with root causes is that it naturally takes us to the past. Thats about history and archaeology, literally and metaphorically. This takes us to readings, subjectivity, the distortion caused by outcome preferences and such. It also comes down to how far down you want to dig, because some roots go a long way down and their excavation can not only be arduous but can reveal truths that make the particular digger uncomfortable. 
Take the ethnic conflict for example. Where does one begin The year 1983 and the July riots is a valid beginning to some. Even that can be written in many ways. One can focus on the role of the then UNP Government, the deployment of the partys trade union arm, the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya (JSS) and the non-deployment of forces that could have effectively prevented or at least minimized the loss of life and damage to property. It was just the Sinhala Buddhists who have racism, chauvinism and intolerance in their DNA doing their thing, some can say (as some have said). Recounting is also about exaggeration and down-playing, this too we know. 

Was it 1977 when the TULF became the largest party in the Opposition Was it 1976 and the Batakotte (Vadukkoddai) Resolution of the TULF Was it 1975 when Prabhakaran murdered the SLFP Mayor of Jaffna Alfred Duraiappah How about 1949 when S.J.V. Chelvanayagam founded the Federal Party or 1939 when G.G. Ponnambalam made his (in)famous 50-50 demand Shouldnt we begin with the Pan Sinhala Cabinet that was set up under the Donoughmore Constitution in 1936, one might offer. How about how the British elevated the non-Sinhala and non-Buddhist sections of the population as per their divide-and-rule preference When Ponnambalam Ramanathan demanded in the 1920s that the first university be set up in Jaffna, didnt it indicate some kind of nascent Tamil chauvinism, one could ask. It was all because of Anagarika Dharmapala, someone might insist. Really, but then Arumugam Navalars Hindu Revivalism pre-dates Dharmapala, the latter being just 15 years old when the former died at the age of 57, another could counter. 
Forget all that! Its Bandaranaikes Sinhala Only business in 1956 that set the country down this mad road to self-destruction. This and nothing else is the root cause. It is the Mother of all Root Causes, in fact! 
Somehow, over the years, this root has taken root. Now if this were the true root then dealing with it makes absolute sense. If, on the other hand, it is not The Root or if it is only One of Many Roots then rooting for it amounts to barking up the wrong tree, so to speak. 

"An exhaustive exploration would have to examine all claims and weigh their weight in the conflict-equation"
An exhaustive exploration would have to examine all claims and weigh their weight in the conflict-equation. Each has merit and each, in isolation, tells a partial story. We also need to seek out the less talked of and the absented in all this. Having said that, lets consider this Sinhala Only Root. 
Sinhala Only is the term used for the Official Language Act No. 33 of 1956. It replaced English as the official language of Ceylon with Sinhala. A language thats mother-tongue to almost two-thirds of a population is as national as any. When it is spoken by a further 10-15% theres no question about its primacy. That said, it was not only ill-conceived but went against the grain of the philosophy embedded in the coinage of the name Sinhala, which comes from Siv-Hela, or the four Helas (Yaksha, Raksha, Naga and Deva), essentially speaking of and to integration and accommodation as opposed to exclusivity. It is not taken that way by many Sinhalese, this has to be acknowledged. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, a demagogue and a political manipulator if ever there was one, played to the worset sentiments of this community. His wife did not, but his daughter went to the other extreme, vilifying Sinhalese and Buddhists in a way that the United National Party has never done; but thats a different story. 
Why did the Sinhalese embrace Sinhala Only and why were they ready to drop it and acknowledge that Tamil should also be a national language The root cause of all that, I offer, is the English Only that preceded that ill-conceived and ill-formulated Act in 1956. 
English was the language of the conqueror, who was also a mass murderer, a brigand, a sacker of villagers, poisoner of wells and reservoirs, breacher of dams and perpetrator of cultural genocide and ethnic cleansing. English was the vehicle used by those forces that came along with the gun-toting thugs from Britain ready to civilize the heathens not only by making religious conversion a prerequisite for education and employment but even razing temples and kovils to the ground, burning libraries and stealing manuscripts. 
"Sinhala Only is the term used for the Official Language Act No. 33 of 1956. It replaced English as the official language of Ceylon with Sinhala"
Bandaranaike brought Sinhala Only against that history. Naturally the majority of the disenfranchised found in the proposal an opportunity for betterment. It is easy to say, after the fact, that he could have included Tamil and need not have dumped English, but that wont get us anywhere. 
Whats relevant is that this lack of vision only served to alienate Tamils while doing little to uplift the lot of the Sinhalese because the structures of control remained English-laden. Things have not changed over the years. Opportunity is spelled in English, so to speak. The simple truth that theres a way to lose culture and self by dropping mother-tongue and theres a way to deny oneself the advantages of being fluent in other languages by misplaced sense of identity and nationalism. 
In any case, it was a landmark for reasons other than this root-cause business (which, arguably, it is not). And if one was hesitant to accept one cause for multiple problems, if one were ready to consider the multiplicity of causes and the complexities of historical processes and the outcomes they generated, theres nothing more simplistic, erroneous and dangerous as reducing our ills to Sinhala Only. Indeed, I offer, that English Only has a better case (though incomplete) for the title Mother of all Root Causes.

## Title: ASSAULTS OF TOURISTS DEALT WITH FAST UNLIKE IN THE PAST
## Section: Opinion

ASSAULTS OF TOURISTS DEALT WITH FAST UNLIKE IN THE PAST
	
Suspects of alleged assault on Dutch tourists in Mirissa are taken to court

It was most welcome that the incident of a Dutch tourist assaulted by 16 people on the beach in Mirissa was dealt with fast with all culprits arrested. When an incident of rape and murder happened during the past regime, nothing was done till it was brought up in Britain and then dealt with. The perpetrator of this most horrendous crime, was a supporter of the then ruler and protected till there was pressure from Britain. Minister Sagala Ratnayake, Tourism Minister John Amaratunga, The Chairman of the Weligama UC, Rehan Jayawickreme and the Tourist Board headed by Kavan Ratnayake have to be thanked for getting this done and for the increased presence of Tourist Police in the area.
People who are quick to pick nits and criticize must be aware of the vast difference between the two governments, on dealing with incidents of this nature which are a disgrace to our reputation as a paradise for tourists and therefore a hindrance to tourism. When the price of medicines was reduced, there were hardly any accolades by the public, but when the prices went up because of the exchange rate,there was a huge hue and cry.

"People who are quick to pick nits and criticize must be aware of the vast difference between the two governments, on dealing with incidents of this nature which are a disgrace to our reputation as a paradise for tourists and therefore a hindranceto tourism"
The government publicity machine must also be blamed for not giving enough publicity to the good things done. I was glad that at last two of our UNP Ministers did contradict false propaganda, expose the fabrications and defend the UNP and the Leader. They are Navin Dissanayake and Harsha de Silva. Navin was quick to come back on a fabrication written recently, that the politburo was appointed by the UNP leader and was done to create a rift between Sajith Premadasa and him.
The politburo was elected by secret ballot by the committee appointed to go into ways and means of restructuring the party. There were some on the latter committee who are certainly not Ranil Wickermesinghe loyalists. Harsha also made a statement which was loud and clear, that this was the first time that office bearers were appointed by vote at the working committee and not by the Leader. I wish other Ministers and MPs too would follow the example of these two, some are quick to blow their own trumpets instead of defending the party and the Leader. I was shocked like many other UNP supporters to read of one Minister making a statement that he voted against the No Confidence Motion to hang on to his perks and privileges. One wonders if this was the reason he came into politics! Others have also made adverse comments which sound like sour grapes because they were not voted in through the secret ballot to be on the politburo. They are spoiling the laurels that came the way of the UNP after the No Confidence Motion in which they thankfully stood together as a team for the vote, showing that they were indeed the grand old party, not only in name but through word and deed. Still another who accepted office,was apparently shown on TV shouting his dissatisfaction. Why did he accept the post he was given By making statements to the press,they are only helping the JO and nobody else. Do they want a return to white vans, rampant corruption, violence and a dictatorship by one family running the country by instilling fear and subservience

It is another joke that those who lost at the last elections and are only there by the grace and favour of the President are also hurling abuse at the UNP and its leader. Still another who was with Mahinda Rajapaksa, castigated President Maithripala Sirisena in no uncertain terms at the Presidential elections and who jumped fences soon after, is also one of the most vociferous critics of the PM. His own political history is none other than a party jumper which he has done more than once. The PM is being criticized both within and outside the party for Ravi Karunanayake being assistant Leader once again. This too was put to the vote, the working committee was asked if they wished to propose any other names, none were proposed and only two opposed his name, therefore he was elected. 
But it is important that the UNP leader must instill more discipline and insist that Ministers and MPs belonging to the UNP, must refrain from airing their views on internal party matters to the media. This should be done within the precincts of the corridors of power in the party. He must insist that they go on the attack against the previous regime, talk about the misdeeds and talk about what the government has done,defend the party and Leader when attacked as Navin and Harsha have done, showing their political maturity. Ranil has been the linchpin of the UNP through the worst times with his quiet resourceful strength, but he must assert his authority in a tougher way both within the party and as Prime Minister, to see that those guilty of corruption, murder and other misdeeds in the previous regime are punished soon. This is what most people are grumbling about, that little has been done to punish these culprits. Unless this is done we will be on the road to nowhere and back to the vandalizing of democracy and the end of justice and freedom.

"It is important that the UNP leader must instill more discipline and insist that Ministers and MPs belonging to the UNP, must refrain from airing their views on internal party matters to the media"
The UNP in the past never had deputy and assistant Leaders. This was done by Ranil who continues to do so although some in these roles stabbed him in the back! The UNP is fortunate in its second line as most of these are educated professionals, and it is Ranil who is responsible for this as mentioned by Navin in a recent interview. Those who lost their electorates at the recent local government elections have no right to talk about a change in Leadership. I am glad that senior UNPers like John Amaratunga, D.M. Swaminathan and Gamini Jayewickreme Perera spoke out in support of the Leader, quoted the UNP constitution and reminded members that they would have been thrown out by former leaders, like the late Presidents J.R. Jayawardane and R. Premadasa if they had spoken out to the media against party decisions or the Leadership. The UNP can be an unbeatable force with unity, more discipline and is undoubtedly the only party capable of leading the country into a prosperous and peaceful future.
I am reminded of the words of the late W. S. Senior in  The call of Lanka in my prayers and hope for our beloved country. But most shall he sing of Lanka in the brave new days to come.When the races all have blended and the voice of strife is dumb. When we leap to a single bugle, march to a single drum 

No accolade by public when prices of medicinal drugs were reduced
All UNPers stood united to defeat the No Confidence motion against PM
People wonder as to why the corrupt politicos of former regime are stillnot punished

Cabinet endorses pricing formula for fuel
	
The Cabinet yesterday endorsed the implementation of a new pricing formula for fuel in the local market reflecting international price fluctuations and others costs, it is learnt.
The government worked out the new pricing formula for implementation as the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation is cash strapped to issue fuel at subsidized rates. With the implementation of the formula, petroleum prices are slated to rise in the country.
Following the Cabinet go-ahead for the move to introduce a pricing formula, a committee was to meet last evening to discuss the methodology.
A Cabinet source the new pricing formula would reflect the costs involved in pumping, storage and maintenance, and the taxes levied on crude and refined fuel imports.
The world market prices dropped to US $ 45 a barrel in the recent past. However, the prices have increased once again. (Kelum Bandara)

## Title: Executive Presidency needed for countrys sovereignty
## Section: Hard talk
## Date: 10 May 2018 12:30 am
Executive Presidency needed for countrys sovereignty
	
Prof. Ven. Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera
Q All the leaders have pledged to abolish the executive presidency since 1994. The JVP has taken an initiative to abolish it this time. What are your views
It is a popular political topic and slogan. There is no constructive benefit for the country from it, though. This is, in fact, a rotten political topic. Under the pretext of abolishing the executive presidential system, the country is now driven down the path of separatism. May be, the JVP is unaware of its repercussions. It is obvious from the court ruling on the 19th Amendment that it is not easy to abolish the system merely with parliamentary approval. 
I listened to JVP MP Vijitha Herath saying that the President would be elected by the MPs instead of the people, at a public vote, in terms of the new provision. It will amount to an infringement of the universal franchise of people. The peoples franchise is proposed to be entrusted with Parliament in this manner. We noticed how the MPs voted for certain legislations and motions despite harms that entailed for the country. They never looked at those matters from the peoples point of view. They were merely induced by cash offerings, probably in terms of US dollars, and others perks such as luxury vehicles. Nevertheless, peoples minds are pure in this instance. Though politicians get carried away by inducements, people act with mental purity. 
In case the power of electing the President is vested with Parliament, the MPs will get their bargaining power increased for inducements. As the Prime Minister survived the no faith motion, the President will also get elected in the same fashion of offering cash inducements to the MPs. The parties representing the minority communities will flex their muscles increasingly, creating an anarchical situation in the country further. So, we stress that the abolition of executive presidency should not be taken up, even for discussion. 
In the enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, many clauses were incorporated during the committee stage of the debate. Parliamentary power was usurped in a fraudulent way to enact what they wanted in the recent past. 
Q What are the instances you can cite to support your argument
I can cite the manner in which they enacted the Office of Missing Persons Act, the Act on the enforced disappearances. They were withheld for months and months. Finally, they were enacted. When the countrys attention was directed towards the violent incidents in Kandy, the government, with the participation of only 53 MPs in Parliament, enacted the bill on the enforced disappearances. Maybe, the violent incidents have been well-orchestrated for this purpose. The credibility of Parliament has suffered as a result. 
We know the 13th Amendment to the Constitution that provided for the establishment of provincial councils was a dangerous piece of legislation. Despite intense pressure from India, there were safeguards included in it to prevent the partition
of the country.
Then President the late J.R. Jayewardene introduced provincial governors as a result. A Governor is a nominee by the President. Any statute passed by a provincial council can be turned down by the Governor concerned. This power will be taken away in the case of executive presidency being abolished.
If there is a clause included in the new amendment that the Governor should be appointed with the concurrence of the Chief Minister, that is it. In such an eventuality, a governor loyal to the Chief Minister but inimical to the country, can be appointed. Then, the country will become a Federal state virtually. 
We have the concurrent list in the current Constitution envisaging the powers vested both with the centre and the provincial councils. In case this list is abolished, the power will be clearly demarcated between the centre and the provincial councils. The provincial councils may even have powers for taxation. It will make the way for them to have a separate state later on. 
Only the Security Council should decide on the land use when it comes to national security. Today, we see the President and the Prime Minister deciding on lands and distributing them among Tamil people. There is nothing wrong with Tamil people being given back their lands. In the construction of highways and expressways, the Sinhala people compromised with their lands, making way for such development projects. As for national security, people should be ready to make compromises on their lands. People can be given alternative lands, instead. 

"I listened to JVP MP Vijitha Herath saying that the President would be elected by the MPs instead of the people, at a public vote, in terms of the new provision. It will amount to an infringement of the universal franchise of people"
Q How do you talk with certainty when even the final draft of the amendment is not ready yet
There is a demand for the change of the character of the constitution from unitary to united country. We are aware of the Singapore resolution adopted by the parties clamouring for constitutional changes here. This is a part of this Singapore resolution being adopted here, now. 
The JVP says the 20th Amendment, if incorporated, will apply only to future Presidents but not to President Maithripala Sirisena. President Sirisena is not the protector of this country. Also, the incoming President will not be someone inimical to the country.
The President is appointed by the votes from people throughout the country. But, someone elected by the votes of people from one particular district is chosen as the Prime Minister. The President is someone who polls more than 51% or more votes from people in the entire country. That is the difference between the two. The peoples sovereign right has to be protected. 
The Prime Minister does not account for the country today. The President is also the same. Whenever a serious issue is raised in Parliament, the Prime Minister mockingly laughs at it and dodges the problem. The entire country has become a mockery as a result. The President should be held answerable to the whole country. Today, the President has submitted himself to the Prime Minister.
Q Why do you say so
Today, two key officials assigned to the Presidents Office have been arrested. It is not something that happened by chance. It is a well-orchestrated plan. Otherwise, action should have been taken to arrest those responsible for the Central Bank bond frauds. The government remained silent till the biggest fraudster of the bond scam fled the country.
The presidential post lost its shine today. There is a perception now built that anybody can become a President. If there was any measure of dignity left, that was also taken away when his Chief-of-Staff was arrested by bribery sleuths. 
In some countries, people do not care for their Presidents. These countries have fallen into anarchical situation. The same is happening here now. No President ever compromised the dignity of his post. Now, the current President has compromised the dignity of his profession. By arresting the Chief-of-Staff, there is a message sent to the world that the key officials of the President who vowed to root out corruption, are also indulgent in frauds. 

"In case the power of electing the President is vested with Parliament, the MPs will get their bargaining power increased for inducements. As the Prime Minister survived the no faith motion, the President will also get elected in the same fashion of offering cash inducements to the MPs"
Q The present President keeps contacts with you. Have you discussed this matter with him personally
I normally discuss the matters relevant to the country with him. I asked him not to alienate the national assets of the country. When the government tried to lease out the Hambantota Port to a Chinese company, I asked the President not to allow that to happen.
Then, he asked how the government could settle the debt burden. It is not a question to be directed at us. He, as the President, should have an action plan for it. 
We discussed about the war heroes. Today, our intelligence chief is incarcerated. The government has launched a witch-hunt on war heroes. It is as if all wrongdoings have been committed by war heroes. No one from the LTTE has been arrested. Politicians are involved in so many frauds. But, none of them are arrested. The government is doing all these things to please the pro-LTTE Tamil Diaspora. 

"If anybody tries to abolish the executive presidency to make Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa the executive Prime Minister, we do not agree. Mr. Rajapaksa is not an immortal. Who is there to look after this countryafter him"
Q There is a perception that some are opposed to the abolition of the executive presidency because they plan for making Gotabhaya Rajapaksa the next President. What is your view
We are opposed to the abolition of executive presidency because it is needed to protect the country. Otherwise, it is not because we wanted to make someone the President. There is no heir to the executive presidency.
Nobody thought Mr. Sirisena would become the President. Actually, consequent to Mr. Sirisenas presidency, a lot of unworthy people also harbour presidential ambitions today. 
The executive presidency is part and parcel of the current Constitution. The country cannot be governed without the executive presidency. 
Now the government has breathed life into the tiger by enacting the 13th Amendment. Yet, the tiger is caged. In fact, the tiger is caged to the post called executive presidency. If you abolish the executive presidency, the live tiger is untethered. It will run amok and cause havoc. The tiger is the allegory for separatism here. 
In the run-up to the presidential election in 2015, there were those who vowed that they would be in the forefront to protect the country in the event of any attempt to divide the country. They are not to be seen even today. They talked about a new country within 100 days. Today, we have a police that charge at women in temples with wooden poles.
This is in stark contrast to what they promised to people ahead of the presidential elections. I respect Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa the most, not because of anything but because of the fact that he resurrected the country from terrorism. If anybody tries to abolish the executive presidency to make Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa the executive Prime Minister, we do not agree. Mr. Rajapaksa is not an immortal. Who is there to look after this country after him 

"Today, we see the President and the Prime Minister deciding on lands and distributing them among Tamil people. There is nothing wrong with Tamil people being given back their lands. In the construction of highways and expressways, the Sinhala people compromised with their lands, making way for such development projects"
Q You keep contact with the joint opposition. That is also divided on the abolition of executive presidency. How do you see it
Already, Indias RAW is in operation, cultivating both sides. They are asking the Joint Opposition to be neutral. They are asking the other side to implement the promises made to people in this regard.
If Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is assigned the task of abolishing the executive presidency, there will be a major public uproar. Therefore, they are using a cats paw for it. That is, JVP Anura Kumara Dissanayake and others in the party. The JVP is a set of soul-less creatures in the political sense. They also face bribery charges by Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. They have politically drifted towards the right of centre from left of centre. Anura Kumara Dissanayake is virtually the spokesman for UNPs Sirikotha.

Fuel price hike a result of unsuccessful governance: JO
	
While claiming that the Yahapalana Government is a failure, the joint opposition today said the increase of fuel prices and other basic services were results of unsuccessful practices carried out by the government.
MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena told a news conference that the government was continuing against the will of the people and added that the country had now plunged into an anarchical state.
As a result of this unsuccessful procedure, the prices of fuel and rates of electricity and water bills will be increased in near future by adding more burden on the people. Another result of this condition is the rising malnutrition ranking of Sri Lanka. The agriculture sector of the government is mostly devastated leaving innocent farmers helpless, he said.
While referring to the advertisement thanking people for paying taxes, MP Abeywardena said the government was in an attempt to loot peoples money and they would continue it even in future.
Meanwhile, joint opposition member MP C. B. Rathnayake told the media that the supplementary estimate valued over Rs. 18 billion which was recently approved by the House was mostly for buying vehicles and added that the people had to pay taxes for them also. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Fuel prices to be revised every two months
	
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera today said the prices of fuel will be revised every two months according to the new price formula, and they can increase or decrease.
He said the price revision will be announced on the fifth day after the lapse of every two months.
Minister Samaraweera said Sri Lanka among the regions is providing maximum subsidy for crude oil.
He also said though crude oil price decreased for three years during the Rajapaksa administration but the benefit was not given to the people.
The Minister stated that he was informed that a barrel of crude oil price has been increased up to USD 77 soon before he addressed the press conference therefore he believes that it could increase up to USD 80 due to the situation of crude oil manufacturers such as Iran.
He also said the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) would receive an unbearable loss if the Government had to continue to supply the crude oil for the same old price and will have to curtail the funds allocating for the countrys development, health and education sectors.
We learned that we cannot maintains the same old fuel prices. We will be able to save Rs 55.89 billion with the new price revision, he added.
The Minister said the saving would be allocated to special rural development programme.
According to the new fuel price revision kerosene oil was the most increased and therefore the Minister said it could badly affect the low income communities.
To prevent such an impact, the minister said the Government had decided to provide kerosene subsidy to Samurdhi beneficiaries and small fishing boat owners.
The programme to be initiate from June 1 and Samurdhi beneficiaries will provide a coupon for kerosene subsidy while the fishermen will receive money to their accounts.
However, the Minister added that the practice would not be applicable on all Samurdhi beneficiaries and all fishermen but those who pre identified living without electricity or using kerosene for fishing boats.
Meanwhile, Minister said that the tax imposed on the interest rate on Childrens savings accounts (below 18 years) will be removed soon.
Minister stated that during the Rajapaksa administration 2.5 percent tax was collected from the childrens savings accounts when there interest exceed Rs 5,000.
Further he said that copyright earnings less than Rs 50,000 per month or Rs. 500,000 per annum would be free from tax.
Minister Samaraweera also said that the fuel price revision would not profit the CPC.
In order to make the CPC profitable we should restructure it, he added. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

## Title: Gota and Fonseka trade charges on who attacked Lasantha and  Keith

Gota and Fonseka trade charges on who attacked Lasantha and  Keith
	

The key technical evidence presented by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to the Mount Lavinia Magistrate Court in connection with the investigations into the 2008 abduction and assault on Senior Journalist, former Deputy Editor The Nation newspaper Keith Noyahr and the 2009 murder of Editor-in-Chief of The Sunday Leader newspaper LasanthaWickrematunge was originally gathered prior to the 2015 change in Government, according to former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Speaking to the DailyMirror last week, Rajapaksa recalled that the records of telephone conversations and other evidence were unearthed during their time (Government). According to Rajapaksa, immediately after these incidents, they were able to unearth all this evidence. 
He further said that he ordered all the intelligence agencies to conduct investigations to identify the perpetrators. He specifically recalled doing so in connection with the murder of Wickrematunge and the abduction and assault of Noyahr.

Referring to the current leadership and investigators conducting these inquiries and investigations into other attacks during the previous regime, Rajapaksa accused the CID officers of trying to show that this evidence was found by them. They have found nothing. These are all what we found. They are manipulating evidence we found, Rajapaksa affirmed. 
Rajapaksa also said that despite he himself having personally ordered the investigations that led to the initial gathering of the evidence now being presented by the CID to court, the CID was using this evidence to make arrests and is now trying to coerce those who were arrested into wrongfully implicating him in order to earn their freedom. They are arresting them and telling them that if you say Gotabaya Rajapaksas name then you can get out, the former Defence Secretary charged. 
CID Director Shani Abeysekara provided a brief statement in response to questions in this regard from the Daily Mirror. 
The CID does not comment on ongoing criminal investigations. All material findings are reported to the court of law with appropriate jurisdiction as provided for by the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Most of the time, facts so reported to court are part of the public record. Regarding the investigations on the murder of Mr. Lasantha Wickrematunge and the abduction of Mr. Keith Noyahr, the CID reports regularly to the Mount Lavinia Magistrates Court under Case Numbers B 92/2009 and B 1535/2008 respectively. The CID is not currently aware of any material facts in these criminal investigations that were discovered during 2008  2014 period that have not yet been reported to court, the CID Director said. 

Asked specifically about the allegation by Rajapaksa that the CID is now presenting material discovered during his time and presenting it as new, Director Abeysekara declined to respond directly to Rajapaksa, but said in his statement, Any current or former public officer with knowledge of material facts relevant to a criminal investigation has a legally binding duty to share such information with the police, who are required to record a statement to that effect and report the material to court. Even today, we urge any citizens or current and former public officers who possess such information, reports or other material that could lead to the arrest of any suspects in these cases to contact the CID and share this information in accordance with the law. 
Having perused the reports filed in these cases in the Magistrate Court by the police from 2008 to date, theDaily Mirrorwas unable to find any indication that the findings described by the former Defence Secretary were reported to court prior to 2016, a year after the dormant investigations were reactivated by the Sirisena-Wickremasinghe Government. 
For his part, Rajapaksa states that he shared all the information he had with the CID when they recorded his statement last year regarding the Keith Noyahr investigation, but maintains that the police have been deliberately picking and choosing which parts of the investigation should be reported to court. I went and gave evidence. I told them, but the issue is it is up to them. When they file a B report, they put only what they want to tell the judge. They dont put the whole story. This is very unfair, he charged, further alleging that the CID is instead planting accusations against him in the media. 
Recently in one of the State run newspaper, an article appeared about Noyahr with a big headline, with all what the CID has given them. Now its not fair for the CID to do it. When the CID gives B reports to the judge, they only paint the picture that they want. The CID is there to find the culprits. They cant first paint a picture and then try to fit all these things according to their picture. Then they will be going behind innocent people rather than getting hold of the culprits Rajapaksa said. 
Last year, the CID arrested seven current and former military intelligence officers whom they accused of participating in the May 2008 abduction and assault of Keith Noyahr from outside his residence on Waidya Road in Dehiwala. The seven suspects arrested are Major Prabath Bulathwatte, Lance Corporal Hemachandra Perera, Corporal Duminda Weeraratne, Corporal Lasantha Wimalaweera, Private Nishantha Jayatillake, Lance Corporal Nishantha Kumara and Corporal Chandrabhaya Jayasuriya. 
When the suspects were produced before the Mount Lavinia Magistrate Court, the CID submitted a report detailing telephone tower records and calls that implicated them in surveilling Noyahr for several hours as he moved through Colombo. They later abducted him and transported him to a safe house in Dompe. The CID later reported that they had located the safe house, and produced a rental agreement signed by two military intelligence officers who served under the first suspect, Major Bulathwatte. 
Though former Defence Secretary Rajapaksa could not recall whether the evidence gathered during his term in office directly implicated Major Bulathwattes team, he referred questions on specifics to his Chief of National Intelligence Kapila Hendawitharana. 
Weekly intelligence meetings 
According to Rajapaksa, the heads of each intelligence agency were asked to investigate all attacks against journalists, including Wickrematunge and Noyhar, and they regularly briefed him and Hendawitharana on their evidence and conclusions at the weekly intelligence meetings at the Ministry of Defence. The former Defence Secretary recalled in particular getting briefings from former DIG Chandra Wakishta, who headed the Terrorist Investigation Division and the State Intelligence Service, the then CID leadership and former Chief of National Intelligence, retired Maj Gen Kapila Hendawitharana. Every Tuesday we had that meeting so they came out with what they had found, Rajapaksa said. 
Former Chief of National Intelligence Hendawitharana, however, told theDaily Mirrorthat he vividly recalls the Defence Secretary ordering all the intelligence agencies to investigate these crimes, and that they regularly reported their progress to both the Defence Secretary and him. I remember the heads of CID, TID, SIS and DMI definitely attended these meetings, the former National Intelligence chief recalled adding The armed forces chiefs may have also been present. While Hendawitharana could not recall the conclusions reached following these investigations, Rajapaksa was unequivocal on where the blame lay, according to the reports received from intelligence agencies. 


I knew, definitely, that Sarath Fonseka was behind these crimes, the former Defence Secretary charged, pointing the finger unequivocally at the former Army Commander. According to Rajapaksa, despite he knew that the former Army Commander was behind these incidents, he still allowed the CID to obtain the correct evidence and conduct investigations. According to Rajapaksa the reason he did not take action, is that as the Secretary of Defence, he did not want to gain political advantage over it. 
Responding to Rajapaksa charge, former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka told the Daily Mirror that anyone in the country knows that if the Rajapaksa Government had any evidence implicating him in any of these attacks on journalists, he would have been dragged to the prison in chains after the January 2010 presidential elections, by the Defence Secretary without sparing a thought to the criminal justice system, for no other reason than to fulfill a political vendetta.
If Gotabaya Rajapaksa is a self-respecting person, he should come out and reveal the truth and make available the information he has to the CID instead of levelling wild accusations against me in the media, Fonseka said. When the police are closing in on him this is what he does. Rather than defending himself, he sends his lawyers running to the Supreme Court to get rulings preventing him from being arrested. The day I am accused, I will defend myself like a lion, not like a coward, Fonseka asserted.
Motive behind attacks on journalists 
Hendawitharana, however, while agreeing with Rajapaksa that the evidence available at present implicates the former Army Commander, does not recall reaching any such conclusions as the investigations were not completed during his tenure in office. It is very significant to note that all such victims did not write anything against me nor Gotabaya Rajapaksa, but they were written against the Army. It is very obvious that the Army Commander has to take the responsibility for the attacks if army troops were involved. Further I did not have any command nor responsibility over army troops, Hendawitharana added. 
When questioned what the motive was behind ordering these attacks on journalists such as Wickrematunge and Noyahr, Hendawitharana asserted that such victims did not write anything against him nor Rajapaksa (Gotabaya), but did write against the army. 
In fact, the former Defence Secretary was in the middle of a bitter legal dispute with Lasantha Wickrematunge at the time the latter was killed. The dispute was over a civil defamation case filed by Rajapaksa against the slain editor in the Mount Lavinia District Court in 2008 over articles written alleging impropriety in the 2006 MiG Deal, which is currently under investigation by the Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID). After Wickrematunge was murdered, the ownership of the newspaper changed hands and The Sunday Leader admitted fault, apologized to Rajapaksa and settled the suit.

Former Defence Secretary, for his part, points out that each time he was accused of threatening a journalist, his actions had been prompted by complaints he had received from then army commander Sarath Fonseka, who he said was used to complain to him about journalists writing against the army.
The former Defence Secretary was referring to accusations that he had made a death threat over the telephone to former daily newspaper Editor in 2007, and later personally threatened Lake House journalists Poddala Jayantha and Sanath Balasooriya with death after summoning them to his office at the Ministry of Defence. In the latter instance, Rajapaksa insisted that Sarath Fonseka had complained to him that these journalists were protesting against the army.
However, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, speaking to theDaily Mirror, strenuously denies charges that he had any involvement in these attacks or threats. Field Marshal Fonseka took specific issue with the accusation levelled in a recent column in The Island newspaper that his motivation to attack Noyahr may have been an article written in The Nation titled An Army is not its Commanders Private fiefdom. 
What Keith Noyahr had stated in his column, that the army is not its commanders private fiefdom is exactly right, Fonseka said. It was Mahinda Rajapaksa and his younger brother Gotabaya Rajapaksa who believed that the forces are their private fiefdoms and had constant disputes with journalists, but no one else, said the former army commander. Fonseka specifically charged that the weekly intelligence meeting referenced by Rajapaksa was used to supervise all intelligence operations in and around Colombo from the Ministry of Defence, through a separate chain of command packed with loyalists, bypassing the normal organizational structures of the three armed forces and the police. According to the former army commander, it is through this group and even with former LTTE cadres that the Rajapaksas formed a faction to plan high profile assaults, abductions and murders of media personalities and others under the auspices of the targets being a threat to national security. 
White van culture 
Although military intelligence came directly under the army commander, the Defence Secretary handled the Colombo intelligence operations unofficially from the Defence Ministry. They were involved in various unscrupulous activities including the white van culture, Fonseka said. 
For his part, Rajapaksa points out that to accuse him or his Chief of National Intelligence of having any command responsibility over any military or intelligence unit is ludicrous. The Army has infantry regiments such as the Singha Regiment or Gajaba Regiment, engineering Regiments, and other specialized units. The Army intelligence regiment is just one other such regiment. How can anyone say that an Army Commander doesnt have control over the intelligence regiment Then can they say they dont have control over the Singha Regiment also Rajapaksa argued. 
TheDaily Mirrorreached out to the Army to resolve the dilemma posed by the disagreement between the countrys two top wartime defence officials. However, army spokesman Brigadier Sumith Attapattu told theDaily Mirror that the Army is unable to officially clarify what the correct position is regarding the command responsibility for military intelligence officers in Colombo vis--vis former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Army Commander Sarath Fonseka during this period, saying it is a complex and controversial issue. 
False confessions
When asked about the degree of command responsibility that could be attributed to Secretary Rajapaksa and CNI Hendawitharana, Field Marshal Fonseka told the that the former officials could not have it both ways. If they claim that they have no responsibility for what the troops did, why do they claim that the war was won by them he opined. He alleged that after the 2010 Presidential Election, the TID arrested 17 military intelligence officers and tried to force them to make false confessions that they had killed Wickrematunge on his orders, releasing them only months after these efforts failed to pan out.
Last month, the CID arrested the former Director of Military Intelligence (DMI), Maj Gen Amal Karunasekara, who was named the 8th suspect in the Keith Noyahr abduction case. It was this arrest that has sparked the trade of charges between the former Defence Secretary and the Army Commander as to who had given orders to Karunasekara, who is accused by the CID of having coordinated the abduction of Noyahr. This abduction is alleged to have been carried out by Major Bulathwattes platoon of military intelligence officers. 
Rajapaksa points to the Army chain of command and the official procedures in place in his defence, whilst the former Army Commander points to the unofficial command structures, procedures and murky world of intelligence that he says existed during the height of the war. According to Rajapaksa, the CID is choosing to follow Fonsekas interpretation in the face of all available documentary evidence. 

The CIDs arrest of former Director Military Intelligence (DMI) Amal Karunasekara was sparked by his telephone contact with the alleged abductors while they had Noyahr in custody at Baduwatte Wallauwa, a safe house in Dompe, as well as the statement a former military intelligence officer turned state witness had given to the CID that the rent and upkeep for the safe house was allegedly paid for by Karunasekara in his official capacity as DMI. 
According to Rajapaksa, upon being told of Noyahrs abduction by the former Nation Editor Lalith Allahakkoon, he had immediately contacted DIG Jayantha Wickremaratne and Chief of National Intelligence Kapila Hendawithara to order them to begin an investigation. He says that these calls, which amount to him doing his duty when informed of a crime, are now being used to frame him with culpability. 
Regarding the murder of Wickrematunge, Rajapaksa too recalled a specific breakthrough on the telephone numbers used in the crime which, according to him, the CID has yet to act on. 
During our time, the CID found a corporal who had influenced a Tamil person to get the SIM cards. They found that person was a corporal from the military intelligence. When he was in custody a Fundamental Rights (FR) application was filed and he (suspect) got released. It was Mr. JC Weliamuna that appeared for the suspect and obtained bail, Rajapaksa claimed. 
The former Defence Secretary was referring to Military Intelligence Lance Corporal Kandegedera Piyawansa, who was arrested by the TID in February 2010, based on a statement recorded by the CID in January 2010 from a motor mechanic in Nuwara Eliya- Pitchai Jesudasan implicating Piyawansa in the purchase of SIM cards that were used during Wickrematunge murder. 
Piyawansa was a member of the Military Intelligence team led by Major Bulathwatte, who was arrested in connection with the Keith Noyahr abduction. 
They didnt pursue that line at all, Rajapaksa alleged. 
However Piyawansa was awarded a promotion to corporal while in remand custody after his 2010 arrest, and the army continued paying his salary in violation of establishment procedures. The CID also discovered in 2016 that Piyawansa had been granted several loans from the army while he was in custody. Piyawansa was granted relief by the Supreme Court last year in the form of an order that TID Inspector Bogamuwa pays him Rs. 100,000 for violating his fundamental rights according to the court submissions by the CID. 

The CID has charged in court, in oral submissions made in both Noyahr and Wickrematunge investigations that the former regime deliberately botched the investigation into Piyawansas role and protected him from facing a serious inquiry. 
Reports filed by the CID in the Mount Lavinia Magistrate Court, however, reveal that sleuths conducted a wide-ranging investigation into the circumstances of Piyawansas arrest in 2016, which led to the discovery of his promotions and financial concessions received from the Army whilst in remand which included the payment of his salary. Despite all these there was a failure to interdict him. Instead he was granted multiple loans on concessionary terms, none of which had been brought to the Armys attention prior to the CID investigation. 
In a series of oral submissions supported by written reports to the Mount Lavinia Magistrate Court, the CID has taken up the position that the platoon led by Major Bulathwatte acted under the auspices of the Ministry of Defence, bypassing the Army chain of command, as suggested by Sarath Fonseka.
The officer on the ground, who was responsible for several of these investigations in 2010, was retired DIG Chandra Wakishta, who was in charge of both the TID and SIS in 2010. Speaking to theDaily Mirrorfrom Germany, Wakishta verified that one year after the murder of Wickrematunge, the Defence Secretary had wanted the TID to take over the investigation jointly with the CID. 


We were able to unearth the five SIM numbers used by the assailants and these phones had been topped up from a place in front of the Tripoli Military Intelligence Camp in Maradana, recalled DIG Wakishta while concluding that they had obtained information that Fonseka was behind Wickrematunges attack. 
Asked why the TID then failed to question Fonseka if this was the case, Wakishta replied that while his presumption is that these attacks had been carried out by the Army, he was unable to gather enough evidence to justify questioning Fonseka in 2010. Wakishta stressed that the TID was planning to make a breakthrough in the Wickrematunge and Noyahr cases based on information that they were jointly carried out by the Kohuwala team, but they never gathered sufficient evidence to proceed from there onwards. We questioned former DMI Amal Karunasekara, who is now in remand custody, to obtain details for a breakthrough, but he did not cooperate with us, Wakishta added. 
Wakista says that a place near the Tripoli Intelligence Camp, where Wickrematunges assailants had reloaded their prepaid SIM cards, is the same camp in which Major Bulathwattes team including Corporal Piyawansa belonged. However the police failed to investigate this team nor question Bulatwatte until the change in Government. 
In the end, former Army Commander Fonseka and the CID charge that intelligence and security operations in Colombo, and these attacks in particular, were handled directly outside the Ministry of Defence. While several current and former defence officials do corroborate the assertion that there was a grey area where defence officials including Rajapaksa and Hendawitharana could issue orders to intelligence units, especially in Colombo. Both of them deny having any formal or informal command responsibility.
All current and former police, defence and military officers contacted by the Daily Mirror in connection with these investigations agree on only one point that the murder of Wickrematunge and the abduction of Noyahr were carried out by Army intelligence personnel. Beyond that point, the public will have to wait for the CID and the courts to decide on which of the denials by our former Defence Secretary and former Army Commander is the more credible, based on the evidence and testimony available now.

Mr. I.T. Canagaretnam was one of the most respected Police officers in the country. He was held in high esteem by all communities. He was a man who carried out his duties and responsibilities with a sense of justice. At the same time he displayed his humaneness. He not only excelled in his official capacity as a police officer, but also rose to a high level in sports administration. He was the President of the Sri Lanka Basket Ball Association and represented Sri Lanka as an official at the Olympic Games. 
Canagaretnam always attributed his success to his religious upbringing and was a devout member of the Catholic Church. Even though he achieved great successes professionally and socially he always remembered St. Michaels the Jesuits priests and the culture of Batticaloa as an integral part of his life. He was a loyal friend who would always go that extra mile to lend a helping hand to anyone without expecting anything in return. 
His loyalty to his family and to St. Michaels, Batticaloa was the hallmark of his life. He treasured his beloved wife Rita as a God given gift and treated her with much respect and love. He always ensured that she was given the pride of place in all his successes. His children and grandchildren were his joy and he showered them with love and affection. 
I knew Canagaretnam for nearly 50 years where we worked together furthering the Colombo branch of the St. Michaels Old Boys Association. 
His selfless and untiring efforts and all those years laid the solid foundation for the success of the Colombo Branch of St. Michaels Old Boys Association. 
It is a great honour for me personally to have known Canagaretnam. I would treasure the memories of him as long as I live. 
May he rest in peace

Johann Peries braves freezing temperatures to reach halfway up Mt Everest
	
As the nation waits with bated breath for news about Johann Peries as he attempts to scale Mount Everest, there are some exciting updates! In the latest update on his adventurous journey, Johann is approximately halfway through the expedition to scale Mt Everest! He commenced his journey by flying from Kathmandu to Lukla, from where he hiked for ten days to reach Everest Base Camp (EBC). The base camp will be his adopted home for approximate five weeks. Keeping him warm amidst the freezing weather in the Himalayas, is the wonderful response to the Climb Everest with Johann campaign, which invites Sri Lankans to sponsor each step that Johann takes on the mountain for Rs.100 to participate in this exhilarating climb to the summit. An Everest expedition requires a large financial commitment and every step sponsored goes towards financing the expedition. Johann has dedicated this expedition to all Sri Lankans.
Using the camp as his base, Johann will perform a series of climbing rotations. A rotation is a climbing exercise in which the climber climbs to a higher altitude, rests and then returns back to the base. With each successive rotation, the climber climbs to a higher altitude and so far Johann has completed the rotation to Lobuche Peak which is 6,119m high. This is a particularly difficult climb after which he required rest and then a series of ladder training exercises to prepare him for the next rotation through the famous Khumbu Icefall- a treacherous series of glaciers which have to be crossed with ladders.
Currently, Johann is on a rotation through the Khumbu Icefall up to Camp 1 from where he will proceed to Camp 2 and then back down again. The complete rotation will take five days and he is expected to return to the Everest base Camp at the end of this week.

Having been in training since December 2016, Johann is technically equipped to undertake this expedition. He is no stranger to this act of courage. Johann Peries and Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala were the first Sri Lankans to attempt to summit the peak of 8,848m above sea level in April 2016. Johann managed to reach a height of 8,400m, a mere 448m short of reaching the summit, before technical difficulties forced him to descend.

## Title: lets not foget The introverted child - EDITORIAL

lets not foget The introverted child - EDITORIAL
	

ith never ending monthly tests, term tests, government tests and tuition classes that run up to late evenings the life of a child in Sri Lanka has turned out to be quite torturous. Pushed by parents, teachers and societal expectations to be the best and be on the list of 9As at the Ordinary Level and 3As at the Advanced Level examinations, has become a game of all or nothing.
On top of that, there now seems to be another challenge. While on the one hand we are getting more and more into the South Asian culture of cramming in education, on the other hand we are also fast borrowing the extrovert bias of the American culture into our schoolrooms. Even the suburban schools have started organising more and more events like class parties, birthday parties, picnics, trips and other social events where the extroverts shine. In and around the schools there are coffee shops to hang out. Besides being good at studies, the student is also expected to be good in sports, swimming, debating and everything else. The target is to be an all-rounder so that he or she becomes popular and the parents can regularly parade the childs trophies.
Of course some students live up to these standards. They enjoy the neck-breaking ride and excel. A vast majority feel harassed. Among the worst affected are the ones who feel way too overwhelmed and drained by this constant pushing. They are the introverts. This group includes those exceptionally bright, nerdy, studious types, who prefer to study in calmer surroundings, those gifted with creative abilities in art and music, average performers in studies and extra-curricular activities and of course those who are weak in all departments. The composition is more or less like that of the extroverts group. The only difference is that while society is supportive of the extroverts, it unfortunately has quite a negative bias towards the introverts and often misunderstands them as either anti-social or lazy. This is turning out to be a bigger problem for the introverts as Sri Lankan culture is fast-tracked to be more and more extrovert-friendly just like the West. While parents in the West are somewhat equipped with the knowledge of the introvert-extrovert differences, in children in Sri Lanka the dialogue is yet to pick up.
Here if a child shuns crowds, parties and loud music parents often read that as a negative trait. One often hears of parents complaining Aiyo, he is very shy or she is a lazy daisy even though the child is quite normal otherwise. They fail to understand that an introverted childs brain is wired in such a way that he or she cannot help being what he or she is. Neuro-scientists assume that nearly one-third of the global population is introverted. 
However, being introverted does not mean a person is anti-social. When pushed into a situation where they have to socialise, most of them manage to do that without much of a problem. However given a choice they would always shun crowds and noise. Among other factors, neuro- science traces the causes of this behaviour by introverts to their relatively bigger blood flow to the brain, compared to the extroverts. As such the introverts feel too easily overwhelmed and stimulated. Naturally they tend to preserve their balance by avoiding whatever overwhelms them too much. They tend to feel content in their own company and feel quite self-sufficient when they sit in a quiet corner and read a book. Extroverts on the other hand have comparatively lesser flow and they feel much stimulated on their own. Thats the reason why they always end up in groups and need external stimulants like parties to feel great.
While a greater number of scientists, musicians, writers and painters were introverts unfortunately a countrys culture is often determined by the extroverts. There are much spaces devoted to the introverts as most of the cities are created by the extroverts  the politicians and businessmen. As such, cities end up being places that invariably cater to the extroverts with a very few places for the silent contemplation and reading by the introverts. In schools too teachers tend to go with the interests and the needs of the dominant talkative extroverts than the silent introverts as theres very little time to get to know children individually. 
Its certainly high time for Sri Lanka to start discussing introverts.

The Lanka-IOC will increase fuel prices following the increase of CPC fuel prices with effect from midnight today, LIOC Managing Director Shyam Bohra said a short while ago.
He told the Daily Mirror that the calculations with regard to prices increase would be concluded by 7 pm today and accordingly they would arrive at a final decision on the increasing rates.

LIOC fuel prices increased
	
While welcoming the Government's decision to allow fuel prices to change in line with international prices, the Lanka IOC company increased fuel prices today.
Accordingly, the latest price of a litre of Lanka Auto Diesel is Rs.111, Xtra MILE is Rs.114, Lanka Super Diesel is Rs.119, Lanka Petrol (92) is Rs.137, Xtra Premium EURO 3 is Rs.143 and Xtra Premium 95 is Rs.151.
Issuing a statement, the company said the current revision in the prices of Auto fuel by the government will assist the oil companies to partially mitigate their losses on the sale of Petrol and Diesel.
Even after the increase in Lanka Auto Diesel prices, LIOC will still have to bear an under-recovery of Rs.10/litre at prevailing international prices, it said.
Due to the sharp increase in the prices of Petrol and Diesel in the international market and steep depreciation of the rupee vis-a`-vis the US dollar, it said oil companies were suffering huge losses.
Although LIOC had increased the prices of Petrol and Diesel marginally with effect from March 24, the company was still suffering huge under-recoveries, as the price hike was only partially done. Implementation of a pricing formulae for Auto Fuel is a welcome step in the interest of the country, the statement said.
