Assault on the Constitution
	
The Implosion of Liberal Democracy: Charting our Action for the Future
?
?
The changes that have happened in a dramatic manner at the helm of the state within the past two weeks or so have shaken our faith in the Constitution drastically. When I say ?our,? I include all of us, those who occupy both the centers and the various peripheries of our polity. What we today describe as the constitutional crisis is an implosion of liberal democracy, one that is created by liberal democracy itself at the convergence of executive presidency, neoliberal policies and majoritarian nationalism. The implosion, without a progressive political, economic or reform agenda or alternative in place, reduces to an authoritarian order and may turn into fascism. If we do not act prudently by mobilizing ourselves to fight against this authoritarian turn, a right wing populism on the road to fascist take-over of the country may be the end game.?
I take this moment of political crisis as an opportunity to ask a few questions about what aspects of our lives and experiences as citizen-subjects that have been threatened by the dastardly decisions made by the President over the past two weeks. Why has this issue drawn so much of local and international opprobrium in contrast to everyday poverty, unemployment, the widening income gap, the dispossession faced by communities on the margins, and the grievances of the women in the North who are searching for their loved ones made to disappear during the civil war, have been experiencing for countless number of decades? How has this event become an extra-ordinary development overshadowing the mundane trials and tribulations of the vast majority of the people??
Even as we feel the need to highlight why parliamentary democracy and constitutionalism are precious to us at this moment, I am pricked by the feeling that we have for long taken refuge in a comfortable shell that it created ignoring issues that undermine the everyday existence of thousands of this country?s citizens. Why has liberal democracy been a comfortable shell for some of us all these decades is a question that I want to ask today.?
?
"The implosion, without a progressive political, economic or reform agenda or alternative in place, reduces to an authoritarian order and may turn into fascism"
This is not the first time we are facing an assault on the constitution. The constitution of our post-colonial state has been violated in various ways starting from the disenfranchisement of the Malaiyaha Tamils immediately after Independence. On the other hand, parliamentary democracy and liberal constitutionalism in post-colonial Sri Lanka has done little to alleviate the structural discrimination and dispossession that the working class populations, the poor, the ethnic and sexual minorities and women have been facing for decades. The freedoms it guaranteed, while having broadened the space for political action on some occasions as in after the regime change in January 2015, have simultaneously allowed the rich to become richer and the poor poorer and the expansion of capitalist agendas. With the entry of neoliberalism in the form of micro-finance companies, uneven development, increased financialization and privatization and land grab, even the minimal safeguards of liberal democracy that had ensured at least a semblance of dignity and stability in the lives of the peripheral populations started to wither away.
Likewise, the freedoms that liberal democracy claims to guarantee have not as yet led to a just solution to the national question. The constitution even criminalizes discourses of resistance and self-determination that challenge the territoriality and sovereignty of Sri Lanka. Liberal democracy has placed the marginalized and the minorities in a trap where choosing the lesser evil is the only option available to them. During elections, it has forced those who inhabit the peripheries to forego their urgent and cherished aspirations and limit the use value of their political strength to, at the maximum, enabling what they perceive as transitions. Its parliamentary version has been an enabling factor in propagating bigotry, feeding racism, and as the recent speech made by the President indicates, homophobia among Sri Lanka?s voting polity. At the conjuncture of neoliberalism, majoritarian nationalism and a political system where executive powers are concentrated in the hands of a single person, liberal democracy is no longer able hold itself together, giving way to the rise of populist and authoritarian forces.??

"Liberal Democracy places the marginalized and minorities in a trap to choosing the lesser evil is the only option available to them"
?
Today some of our political leaders have chosen to flout the Constitution and parliamentary democracy not because they are buoyed by some new-found arrogance but they are confident that parliamentary democracy and its majoritarian logic will save them, as it has done on several occasions previously. President Sirisena appears to be banking on the assumption that the deep-rooted majoritarianism in our state and society, which Mahinda Rajapaksa represents and promotes, will keep him in power however much local activists and international press rebuke him for his failure to uphold the pledges he made in January 2015. The anti-West xenophobia garbed in theories of economic sovereignty may help raise the political fortunes of the more nationalistic segments of our self-serving political class.?
The economic dispossession on the periphery and lack of organic development under the present regime have made it deeply unpopular in the rural South. The kind of image-building that Mahinda Rajapaksa carried out masterfully during his 9-year rule and afterwards as the savior of the rural Sinhala-Buddhist community and its ancient culture seems to override the neoliberal face of his previous regime at a time when the good governance regime is seen as a failure on the economic front by the population on the margins. The JVP?s inability to come up with an alternative economic program for the marginalized and the TNA?s exclusive focus on a political solution to the ethnic question also create the conditions for the rise of right-wing populism in the country. Whatever we do today as a way of challenging those who occupy positions of power constitutionally and unconstitutionally should be informed by a class-based, ethnicity-based and gender-based critique of liberal democracy. How liberal democracy has stratified our geography and the people into centers and peripheries and privileged and oppressed even as it granted some of us a few freedoms.??
?
"Its Parliamentary version enables propagating of bigotry, feeding racism, and as the recent speech made by the President indicates, homophobia among Sri Lanka?s voting polity."
?
?
On the 4th of November, some women from the North who came to the Liberty Circle in Kollupitiya and joined the protestors demanding the restoration of democracy talked about the ways in which the freedoms that the regime change in 2015 brought about enabled them to continue their activism without fear and intimidation. They also spoke about white vans that might soon visit them. Yes, these freedoms matter to the people, not just the privileged but also many on the peripheries, including the North and East, who are trying to make the system work in a fair and just manner or dismantle it from within in their own inconspicuous ways. Yet we cannot limit our rallying cries to these freedoms alone. The current implosion of liberal democracy behooves us to bring to the front and center the various struggles taking place in different parts of this island.?
As dusk fell on the Liberty Roundabout on the 4th of November, a group of protesters chanted about the Uma Oya struggle, about the importance of free education and free health care, about the future of the children in the North, about the return of lands to the communities that have historical claims over them, about de-militarization, and about social justice and ethnic equality. The comfort zones of Kollupitiya where the privileged cosmopolitan Sri Lankan had taken refuge for the past three years endorsing by his commissions and omissions the neoliberal economic policies of the good governance regime until he felt jolted by President Sirisena?s political volte-face cannot ignore these voices any longer.?
The current moment is a time for reflection as much as action; it urges us to be both critical and self-critical. To think and act on these two levels simultaneously, taking into account the importance of the freedoms we have had for the past three years to all of us and their limits and insufficiencies, is what the crisis we are faced with today insists upon us. While we must safeguard the Constitution and Parliament from the authoritarian demagogues in power, we need to be mindful of how the Constitution and Parliament have repeatedly failed the minorities and marginalized sections of our polity. These processes are necessary today to arrest the country?s slide into fascism at present and in the long run. Abolishing executive presidency, introducing progressive economic policies, putting an end to the dispossession happening in the peripheries and addressing the ethnic polarization are some of the key goals that the country needs to work towards immediately with a genuine commitment.?

The Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) was ready to work with the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) or any party who called themselves as leftists at this juncture where the county was embroiled in a devastating situation in terms of politics, the economy and the Constitution, FSP Education Secretary Pubudu Jayagoda said.
Addressing a news briefing today, he said they would work with anybody except with Mahinda Rajapaksa, Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe who should be held responsible for this prevailing anarchical state.
?The tactics of President Sirisena have resulted in a crisis situation and led to a Constitutional crisis as well. The recent speech delivered by President Sirisena shows how irresponsible he is. He said at the speech that parliament was dissolved due to the sad situation where elected MPs were putting a price on their value and the 'amazing behaviour' of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya,? Jayagoda said.
?If he had been so concerned of the sad situation where elected MPs were putting a price on their value, he as the executive should have taken steps instead of dragging the country into a catastrophe,? Jayagoda added.
He proceeded to say that the way the country was being governed, was so undemocratic and added there were ample pre-signs to say that the upcoming parliamentary elections would be a violent one.
Meanwhile, he said they would tomorrow organize rallies to mark November 29 ?Il Maha Viru Day? to commemorate fallen members of the party during the 1988/89 uprising.
?The rallies would commence from three separate venues and the main speech will be delivered by FSP General Secretary Senadeera Gunathilaka at Gampaha Sanasa building? he said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

General Elections:  UPFA factions wrangle over Pohottuwa or beetle leaf
	
There is a tug-of-war between the sections of the United People?s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) on the selection of a symbol to contest the next general elections, it is learnt.
The UPFA faction, loyal to Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, insists that they should contest the polls under the lotus bud or Pohottuwa symbol of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). As a step towards this, these MPs who worked under the banner of the Joint Opposition including the Prime Minister took membership of SLPP ahead of elections yesterday.
Along with them, eight MPs of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) also received SLPP membership. They are Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardane, Chandima Weerakkody, T.B. Ekanayake, Sumedha G. Jayasena, Susantha Punchinilame, Sudarshani Fernandopulle and Taranath Basnayake.
Ratnapura district MP Ranjith de Zoysa, who is from the Joint Opposition, told Daily Mirror that Pohottuwa was an attractive and appealing symbol, and therefore his party would be happy if all could unite under it to contest the elections.
?It is a fresh symbol that is popular and appealing to people,? he said.
However, UPFA MP Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training Dayasiri Jayasekera said he was not ready to take up the SLPP membership purely for political ends.
?I am not willing to get its membership merely for my convenience in getting elected next time. There has to be a mechanism to protect the SLFP,? he said.
Minister Jayasekera said he would seek to contest under a broad alliance under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.
?It is an alliance that should accommodate all the progressive forces,? he said.
Earlier, UPFA Secretary Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said it would be better if all could contest under his party?s beetel symbol. (Kelum Bandara)

Lankan charged with double murder after acid attack on wife, boyfriend
	
A 30-year-old Sri Lankan man charged with two counts of murder after pouring acid on his 23-year-old wife and her boyfriend claimed he didn't mean to kill her.
The man said that he acted on impulse and had been overcome with jealousy.?
His wife died after being transferred to Al Qasimi hospital, United Arab Emirates (UAE), while her boyfriend succumbed to his burn injuries after a few months.
The case dates back to December 2017.
The Sri-Lankan national - identified as Prishni - was arrested at the airport while waiting for his flight to flee the country.
The woman - identified as PI and her boyfriend identified as Pradeep. K - were reportedly having sex when the accused threw acid on them.
The husband told the police that he could never imagine that his wife would cheat on him, as they have had a long courtship before they got married.
However, he started feeling that his wife's behaviour had changed.
According to him, he travelled to his home country for family business which required him to stay there for around 20 days.
However, one week after having reached there, while browsing the Facebook, he spotted a photograph of his wife with another man. He decided not to call her and immediately flew back to Dubai, the man said.
He added that he stayed in a hotel and started monitoring the movements of his wife and her boyfriend.
He followed them when they entered an apartment while leaving the door open.
The man said that he then entered the apartment, went straight into the bedroom and threw acid on them while they were indulged in love-making.
A witness to the incident who lived in the apartment where the crime took place, said the wife would usually come there every week with her boyfriend to have sex.
On that fateful day, she had seen the victim's husband follow the wife and her boyfriend into the room.
The accused confirmed that he had never seen the boyfriend nor met him till the day he threw acid on him. (Khaleej Times)

Playing with the Constitution Continues
	
?
ast Friday President Maithripala Sirisena dissolved Parliament creating yet another twist in the unfolding political crisis. Despite the protests, a written request by a majority of members of Parliament and requests made by the Speaker to convene parliament, the President went ahead with a clearly undemocratic and unconstitutional move to dissolve Parliament and call for elections. According to critics the last two weeks witnessed repeated violations of the Constitution when Mahinda Rajapaksa was appointed Prime Minister; when the Cabinet was said to be dissolved and a new cabinet appointed; and of late when Parliament was dissolved. The Daily Mirror?spoke to some concerned parties in the legal field on their perspectives on the constitutionality of the move to dissolve the Parliament.
?
?
?The unilateral act to dissolve parliament, without first receiving a request approved by two-thirds of the members of parliament, is unconstitutional. Article 33(2)(c) of the Constitution vests in the president the power to dissolve parliament. This general power is then subjected to certain conditions in Article 70, which explicitly states that the president ?shall not? dissolve Parliament until ?the expiration of a period of not less than four years and six months from the date appointed for its first meeting.??
?
"A democracy is not defined by elections alone. Even dictators occasionally hold elections. A democracy requires organs of government to remain accountable to the people even between elections"
The only exception to this condition is when two-thirds of the members of parliament request the president to dissolve parliament. This condition is very clear. The 19th Amendment to the Constitution also introduced Article 33A, which states: ?The President shall be responsible to Parliament for the due exercise, performance and discharge of his powers, duties and functions under the Constitution and any written law.? So the Amendment clearly intended to make the president answerable to parliament when he exercises his powers,? he said.?
?A democracy is not defined by elections alone. Even dictators occasionally hold elections. A democracy requires organs of government to remain accountable to the people even between elections. This accountability is ensured through the constitution. So any major violation of the constitution undermines democracy. For example, if an actor within the executive arm of government unilaterally terminates the legislative arm in violation of the constitution, democracy is fundamentally undermined - not upheld,? he added.?
?
?
Sarath N. Silva said the President has very clear powers under Article 33(2)(c) to dissolve Parliament and that if the process of dissolution emanates from Parliament it has to follow Article 70. ?We have inherited the Parliamentary system from the British. The Parliamentary system was introduced in England with a head of State who was the Queen. The head of state is the total repository of power with regard to dissolution of Parliament. Over the years there is a tradition that the head of State dissolves Parliament on the advise of the Prime Minister.
The head of State under our Constitution is the elected President, who is elected by all the people in the country. Under Article 30 of the Constitution the President is the head of State, head of Government, commander-in-chief of the armed forces. There is no one above him. Dissolution of Parliament has always been under the executive power of the President originally under Article 70. In 2002, when Ranil Wickremesinghe was Prime Minister, 19A was introduced. It sought to remove the executive powers of the President to dissolve Parliament. There was to be an amendment to Article 70 to the effect that the President shall exercise that power only upon a resolution passed by a simple majority of Parliament. The Supreme Court held that the power of dissolution is executive power, that it has to be exercised by the President and that it has to be exercised in trust for the people. On that basis it was held that the amendment to Article 70 was dangerous to the sovereignty of the people and that the bill required a referendum. Then the Bill was withdrawn.
The drafters of the current 19A were well aware of this determination of the Supreme Court in 2002. There is a presumption that laws are enacted on the basis of the recent decisions of the Supreme Court. In the current 19A Article 33 was amended. Article 33(2)(c) reads that in addition to the powers conferred by the Constitution or other law the President shall have the power to summon, dissolve and prorogue Parliament. This is really referable to the Supreme Court judgement. Otherwise the 19A would have required a referendum. Article 62 states that unless Parliament is sooner dissolved it will continue for five years. So ?sooner dissolved? is also referable to Article 33(2)(c). Then Article 70 under the chapter on Parliamentary proceedings was amended. It says that the Parliament shall not be dissolved unless after four and a half years or a resolution by Parliament with two thirds. On the face of it, this is contrary to the judgement of the Supreme Court. This is why overriding power was given to the President to exercise that power.?
?
?
?Though the President has absolute discretion to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament he should do so with good faith. In the present case, he has prorogued and dissolved parliament at his discretion and in the meantime he has switched Prime Ministers and appointed cabinet ministers from Mahinda Rajapaksa?s partyand deemed that Ranil Wickremesinghe?s cabinet members have ceased to function. He has also named a date for general elections. Has he acted in terms of the constitution. The dissolution was not made in good faith for several reasons. Firstly, the present President has a historical background in selecting Prime Ministers because he did not adhere to the proper methodology when appointing Ranil in the first time when D.M. Jayaratne was in office as Prime Minister. Secondly, he appointed MR as the Prime Minister when Ranil has not ceased office, has not resigned or died and continues to assert that he is the Prime Minister. Thirdly, the President prorogued Parliament without consulting the Parliamentarians as to whether they desired a change in the premiership. He selected MR without consulting Parliament. Then he dissolved Parliament which he had the right to do so, provided he acted in good faith. The above matters raises questions as to his good faith. Above acts show that he has acted contrary to the Constitution.
This whole wrongful exercise began with the 19A to the Constitution. Though it was brought by the ?good governance? folk it took away the right of people to have a general election for four and a half years. (i.e it would take more than four and a half years because of the nomination and election period set out in the Constitution).
The President should have received a two thirds majority support in the Parliament to avoid the four and a half year absolute prohibition. This is unlikely because of the 5-year pension rule for Parliamentarians. He should have consulted the Supreme Court by obtaining guidance via a question posed to them. The public must have the right to have general elections to choose who should govern them. But the public is prohibited from having elections in terms of the 19A for four and a half years unless he obtains a two thirds majority in Parliament to have an election which is the people?s aspiration. The only way available to the President was the referendum process where he would have received an overwhelming ?yes? vote.
More so under the present constitution the President is required to ensure that the Constitution is respected and upheld. In terms of the 19A, the President shall be responsible to Parliament for the due exercise, performance and discharge of his powers, duties and functions under the Constitution. Therefore if the Parliament was in session, it could have taken action against the President, instead of the UNP going to court, which is a slower process. There is an obvious lack of urgency on the part of the UNP and belatedness, and an unguided MR has lost the opportunity of the majority in Parliament because the people will now hold him responsible for the debacle in Parliament in being greedy for power. The nett result is we might have to face economic problems, lose face, be called a banana republic and become an economic liability to the people.
?
The President has a duty to find out as to whom the Parliamentarians consider most eminent to become the Prime Minister. He closed doors when he asked for a prorogation.??
In the 19A case of Gomin Dayasri v State Counsel Dayasri raised the question as to if it was not possible to have general elections for four and a half years whether it diminishes the fundamental rights of the people. CJ Sripavan said neither a ?yes? nor ?no? and gave no reasons for either possibility and it let to a downgrading of democracy.?

s the Sri Lankan political scene has been taking new turns during the past couple of weeks, people too have begun to voice out their democratic rights.
Some collectively, and some on their own, individual capacities. One individual, who made headlines last week, was Dr Devanesan Nesiah, who decided to return the Deshamanya title bestowed upon him back in 2017 at the Investiture Ceremony of conferring National Honours.?
Educated at CMS Chundikuli Girls? School and St John?s College, Jaffna Dr Nesiah later moved to study at S. Thomas? College when his father moved there.
Having joined the Ceylon Civil Service at a very young age, he made it to the 1959 CCS Batch the third batch before CCS?s abolition in 1963. Although Dr Nesiah was a Class One Grade One SLAS Officer, he often served at lower positions and it was after many recommendations that he was appointed Government Agent in Jaffna and a new post of District Secretary.
Having served under President Ranasinghe Premadasa and ministers such as Vincent Perera and Srimani Athulathmudali, Dr Nesiah has witnessed a greater part of the political turmoil from back then. In honour of his contribution to the civil service, he was conferred with the prestigious Deshamanya title last year.
However, following the recent outbreak of political events, Dr Nesiah recently wrote an open letter to the President himself.
?
	"My decision isn?t one that I?ve taken lightly, or in haste
	
	
	I can no longer take pride in the title of Deshamanya
	
	
	I have no option but to return my treasured medal and certificate"
	
He penned the letter as follows:
?As a loyal and patriotic Sri Lankan but I see no alternative to regretfully return the Deshamanya medal and certificate that you awarded me. Your Excellency, my decision isn?t one that I?ve taken lightly, or in haste. To always act in accordance with my principles is a burden that I?ve embraced with pride for nearly 60 years since I first enrolled as a cadet in the Ceylon Civil Service.
?My long career in the civil service was often stymied under both UNP and SLFP regimes for my refusal to compromise my values. Since I can no longer take pride in the title of Deshamanya that you?ve conferred on me, I have no option but to return my treasured medal and certificate.?
Speaking to the Daily Mirror Dr Nesiah recalled some experiences while working as a civil servant and shared his views about the reconciliation process.
Excerpts:
Why were you interested to join the civil service at a young age?
The Ceylon Civil Service rules prescribed that men could enter at age 22 or 23, neither earlier nor later.
In reference to a write up written by Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole, it states that although you were a Class 1 SLAS Officer, you had positions at lower levels. Why did it happen that way?
The late Felix Dias Bandaranaike established an institution called the ?Pool? to which Public Servants who refused to carry out irregular directions were assigned.? If there was no breach of the law, they could not be dismissed from office.? The Pool deprived them of work and the perks of office (Official vehicle, quarters), the monetary value of which would far exceed the salary of senior officials like myself.? The Pool was greatly expanded under JR.
Can you recollect the experience as GA in Jaffna?
Very taxing and stressful but also greatly rewarding and satisfying.? My recollections are too numerous and varied to elaborate here, in the course of an interview.
You have served as Secretary under President Premadasa and have witnessed most of the political changes. Where do you think did politics take a wrong turn to what it is today?
It is difficult to highlight a singular moment but there were many wrong turns over a very long period, predating the Executive Presidency.
Even after the war has ended, the North and the South don?t seem to be merging. Why should the sharing of knowledge and culture be promoted to strengthen the reconciliation process?
Culturally, our country has always been well integrated but our politics has been divisive.? The Office of National Unity and Reconciliation has great potential that has not yet been realized.?
Is reconciliation an achievable task after all?
Certainly, yes!
How challenging has it been to continue your service as a law-abiding civil servant in Sri Lanka?
The ability to serve as a law-abiding civil servant in Sri Lanka has been fluctuating over time.? My last lap, as a Deputy to Charitha Ratwatte (Then Commissioner General of Essential Services) merging into my service as Secretary under Minister Vincent Perera, ending under Minister Srimani Athulathmudali, was relatively unproblematic.
Your decision to give up the Deshamanya title was one-of-a-kind. What is your ultimate message to the people?
We had a long and proud history of over two millennia. We need to regain that tradition within the framework of a united Sri Lanka.

President's decisions: FM briefs foreign diplomats
	
Foreign Minister Sarath Amunugama today briefed foreign diplomats based in Colombo at the Foreign Affairs Ministry regarding the chain of events that compelled President Maithripala Sirisena to dissolve Parliament, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
It said the minister had emphasized on the constitutionality of the steps taken by the President and added that having being elected through a nation-wide vote, the President derives his authority directly from the people of Sri Lanka.
He said in the event of a conflict between the organs of government, seeking a mandate from people who are sovereign ensures that democracy prevails.
?The minister also made special note of the peaceful atmosphere that continues to prevail in Sri Lanka, in the midst of internal political changes. This is to the credit of the people of Sri Lanka and re-affirmed the democratic traditions of the country. Through the measures adopted, the minister said the Executive has discharged his responsibility in ensuring the security and safety of all Sri Lankans, which may have been compromised by the growing tension and the departure from parliamentary traditions,? the statement said.
Several country representatives present at the briefing have expressed their confidence in the strength of Sri Lanka?s long standing democratic traditions in resolving this internal matter.

Priority of Govt. to bring down cost of living
	
Priority of the government would be given to addressing burning economic issues like the sharp depreciation of the rupee against the dollar, ease the heavy tax burden on people and bring down the cost of living, Finance State Minister Anura Priyadharshana Yapa said.
Minister Yapa noted that the Finance and Economic Affairs Ministry was in the process of preparing a long, middle and short term strategic plan to plug the depreciation of rupee, bring down the cost of living and a new tax regime that would not put unnecessary burden on the tax payer.
He told the media after assuming duties as the State Minister of Economic Affairs that most of the new economic, monetary and tax policies would be incorporated in the budget 2019.
?We have already given a package or relief to the people soon after the Mahinda Rajapaksa government was formed. The much hated fuel price formula has been withdrawn. More benefits are on the pipeline. But we must admit that we cannot ignore the global and domestic factors when we provide you various relieve. People had been thoroughly disappointed and unhappy over the handling of the economy by the previous government. We try our best to avoid economic and monetary policies of the last government that affected the day today life of the people,? he stressed.
Minister Yapa stressed the need of a complete overhaul of the tax system of the country. Tax evasion was widespread, indirect tax ration was high and direct tax ration was low. There was a shortfall in tax collection than targeted tax revenue every year. The problem faced by the government was to provide relief to the people while facing all these setbacks, Minister Yapa pointed out.
Minister Yapa emphasized that sustainable national economic, tax and monetary policies that would not change with the change of governments was extremely vital if Sri Lana was to achieve sustainable economic progress.
Prime Minister and Finance and Economic Affairs Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, Former Ministers Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana, Dunesh Gankanda, Dr. Sudharshini Fernandopulle and Secretary, Finance S.R. Atygalle were also present at the ceremony. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

## Title: Reigning in the Executive President

Reigning in the Executive President
	
or the most part of the last few weeks we have been in a suspended state of disbelief. Yes, the 2015 government had not lived up to its expectations, some people were plotting for the next election to teach them a lesson, and then lightning struck. The Prime Minister was removed in the stealth of the night replaced by the arch-rival that the President was elected to depose, Parliament was prorogued and then dissolved and a huge cabinet appointed. Neither the Prime Minister nor the cabinet have shown that they have the majority of Parliament behind them and this autocratic rule will continue until January 5, unless the Supreme Court decides otherwise.?
Every day my friends and I text each other with information on who is crossing, what is happening here, what is happening there, so much so that we get lost in the weeds and miss the big picture. What is the big picture? We are today witnessing the gross abuse of executive power in ways that have been quite unimaginable even to the best of our cynics. It is power being wielded not only against the traditions and customs of a parliamentary tradition but in brazen disregard of the words and terms of the Constitution. When I meet people socially due to spin and confusion they say, ?Who cares - one set of crooks vs. another?. This is not about the crooks; it is about institutions, democracy and the system of government you would like in place for your children.?
?
"Pressure and intimidation aimed at the Speaker is disturbing"
The first institution under attack by this runaway executive is the institution of Parliament. It is true the public image of Parliament and parliamentarians is not very good but they do pass laws and do many other things that allow us to govern ourselves according to a set process. The procedure set for the removal of the Prime Minister is quite clear, Sinhala technicalities notwithstanding. But the most important point in a parliamentary democracy is that the prime minister must enjoy the confidence of a parliamentary majority. So even if the removal and appointment were legal, the next step would have been to go to Parliament and take a floor test as soon as possible to see who enjoys the confidence of the house. Instead Parliament was prorogued and dissolved leaving behind a Prime Minister and Cabinet that do not have the approval of Parliament. That is what is meant by autocratic rule. The fact that the SLPP is a willing partner in this even though it has a great deal of popularity in the country and would have probably won the next election is also disturbing.?
?
"Prime Minister must enjoy the confidence of the parliamentary majority "
What was equally as disturbing as the attack on Parliament was the pressure and intimidation aimed at the Speaker. Parliament is supposed to be a co-equal arm of government, a check to a willful executive. Parliamentary staff are expected to take their instructions from the Speaker who heads this co-equal arm. Instead officials of Parliament defied the Speaker and decided to follow the President, an institution they were supposed to check and balance. Such behaviour is a serious threat to Parliamentary democracy and one can only congratulate the Speaker for standing his ground. Protecting the powers, privileges and immunities of the Speaker is a must, if we are to remain a parliamentary democracy.?
?
"The public image of Parliament and parliamentarians is not very good"
The second tradition that is being attacked by the runaway executive are long settled rules of legal interpretation. The arguments for dissolution that the government presented and will be tested in the Supreme Court are a case in point. The Constitution gives the President a general power to dissolve, as one of his many powers. Then in a specific provision it states that the President can only dissolve Parliament after four and-a-half years. It is one of the longest settled rules of legal interpretation that the specific trumps the general;specific provisions qualify the general power. This perversion of legal interpretation in this case will perplex any lawyer and leads us to seriously question the motives of those who make such a crude, instrumental use of the law.?
Another strange development? is the President using his powers to change the leadership of a party other than his own. Whether the UNP needs a change of leadership is something to be discussed by the members of the party and the public. But removing proroguing, dissolving Parliament all because you do not like the leader of another party is quite extraordinary. The President in his first speech on the subject equated his relationship with the Prime Minister as a bad marriage. Surely the answer to a bad marriage is to seek the advice of a counsellor and not to burn the house down with the children in it. In politics and in life, one has to work with people one does not like. One can manoeuvre, discuss or position oneself in this situation but protecting institutions and their integrity must surely be more important than personality differences.?
?
"The fact that the SLPP is a willing partner in this even though it has a great deal of popularity in the country and would have probably won the next election is also disturbing"
?
When the President prorogued Parliament to try and get a parliamentary majority, I was astounded but found that most people were equivocal. I was interested by the comment average people made. It was along the lines of ?It is a done deal they will buy them over?. There was very little moral outrage in this reaction but a cynical acceptance of what politics was like in this day and age. The fact that my Member of Parliament can be bought over for any amount of money without any reaction made me realize the depth of despair in this country with regard to our politics.?
Interestingly the people who received the least respect were the minority parties. Many people assured me that they would be bought over first. As a minority I found this a stunning rebuke to our self-respect. Is that what people think of minority political leaders that they can be bought and sold in an auction??
Speaking of minorities, the scenes at Rupavahini, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, the release of the man supposedly responsible for the Digana anti-Muslim riots instead of re-remanding him as they did in the past, began to raise the threshold of fear - the fear of unruly mobs let lose by politicians. The fear has not gone away. One must commend the Army Commander and the armed services for staying away from this very political contest and one must acknowledge that whatever else he did, the President did not call out the military. Nevertheless there are ominous signs, pockets of violence, pockets of thuggery and an?
uneasy peace.?
?
"One young person told me that she watches the news but her instincts tell her it is all wrong. As a result everyone goes back to their social media bubble and perhaps the international press to discern what is happening"
In recent years we had become accustomed to a diversity of media voices. Today, even though pockets of diversity remain there seems to be a concerted effort to convey only one voice, one truth. Much of it is sheer spin. Foreign envoys, local political parties and other individuals would recount how they would meet the President on his request and they would speak their mind but the discussions were used as a photo opportunity to make out to the public that everyone was extending their support. There is so much spin that one does not know what is truth and what is reality. One young person told me that she watches the news but her instincts tell her it is all wrong. As a result everyone goes back to their social media bubble and perhaps the international press to discern what is happening. A country that loses touch with reality and the-truth, especially a small country such as ours, is on a spiral towards disaster nationally and internationally.
The international repercussions of what has happened will have huge implications especially in the near future. For the moment we are an internationally ?suspect? country. Except for Burundi, I do not think anyone has recognized the new government and probably will not until January. I worked on the issue of the Rohingyas and Myanmar and understood the terrible consequences of being a cast out nation. Yes they survive but at what cost? Beating tribal drums, at war with the west while desiring their investment, and their people portrayed to the world as ugly and prejudiced. We became the number one destination of Lonely Planet, the most respected travel magazine, and like ?evil eye?, within the week the constitutional crisis occurred. Now we are nowhere in the listings. When one was fighting a war, it must have been exhilarating to some to be fighting the imperialist west but in peacetime, the west, India and China are equally important as tourists, as buyers of our exports and as investors. Being a castaway nation even for a few months is just not worth the heated rhetoric.?
?
"The Prime Minister was removed in the stealth of the night replaced by the arch-rival that the President was elected to depose, Parliament was prorogued and then dissolved and a huge cabinet appointed"
We are now experiencing a runaway executive, autocratic rule and promise of free elections under the rubric of that autocratic rule. One can hope the Supreme Court will stop the direction of this flow and that perhaps we can have general elections under a caretaker government. The first thing that any new government should do?
is to do away with or severely limit the powers of the executive president. Time and time again this institution has destroyed the fabric of Sri Lankan life. Ven. Sobitha Thera gave his life in struggling for its abolition. In his memory, we must keep up the effort to ensure that any executive under our Constitution cannot act on whims and fancies, only according to democratic traditions and the rule of law.?

Social topics as tools to achieve political agendas
	
?
If my memory serves me right Sri Lankan politics and politicians have always used sensitive social topics and issues as tools to achieve their political agendas in order to outrun their political opponents. These manipulations were mostly used against stigmatized society to get that extra edge for political profit. Politics has always been a game of manipulation for personal gain. The greater majorities of politicians who target the underrepresented stigmatized section of the population do not understand, care or even empathize about the social injustice brought on this category of Sri Lankans. But they only focus on the bucks that flow into their already lined pockets, the greed for unlimited power politics brings, making somebody out of nobody by elevating politicians above civil society to misuse and abuse privileges as they please. This isn?t anything new to the general public by now, as every successive government that has been in power in the last few decades has been an utter disappointment to the democratic minded citizens in the country.
?
"Politics has always been a game of manipulation for personal gain"
The current political crisis has left citizens confused and agitated about what is happening in the country with the two main political parties claiming to be the rightful owner of the position of prime minister of Sri Lanka. We have been in this game of party politics since Independence 70 years ago. The majority of citizens continue to blindly follow parties and or individuals due to their preconceived notions of one party being better than the other. We are so divided that this preconceived notion is present in all Layers of society. The confusion gets compounded as the experts of the Sri Lankan legal system too share split opinions about the legality of the political situation and also due to the loopholes within the Sri Lankan constitution that open up the constitution to different interpretations. As a non-political citizen regardless of the legality of the matter, I?m of the opinion that the recent political turn that took place in Sri Lanka is undemocratic as it undermines and hinders the very concept of democracy; if a president is able to override the decisions of the elected government of the nation who happens to be the direct representatives of the general public.
?
"Politicos only focus on the bucks that flow into their already lined pockets"
The concept of democracy is structured on the principles of rule of law and majority rule? (the choice of the populace), therefore the ability for the president to veto the very foundation of democracy portrays to be an? undemocratic move to any reasonable person. Since we are already on the topic of majority rule the recent speech of President Sirisena at the ?Jana Mahimaya? rally organized by the United People?s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) has grown into a burning topic of today? only because of the derogatory language used by the President to refer to his political opponents sexual orientation, which has nothing to do with politics. The interesting fact this speech highlights is, that president Sirisena?s use of disrespectful, belittling language was not aimed to condemn his political opponents? lack of political abilities or his political decisions, but was directed at his sexual orientation which has to be reiterated has nothing to do with his political stance. Rather it is used as a form of attack on an easy target to get political popularity evidently.??
?
"Comments made by the highest office further escalate the stigma"
As the President made these comments the audience cheered, a very common sense of humour when insulting someone?s sexuality which is different from the social norm. In a country which has a sigma of high level towards the LGBTQ community such comments made by the country?s highest office only helps to escalate further the stigma that is already in existence in the country and multiplies the disconnect of this community from the mainstream. It also affirms that discrimination of any? sort is acceptable within our society.
?
"Recent political turn that took place in Sri Lanka is undemocratic"
It should be noted that the ?principle of majority rule? explicitly states the importance of majority rule without the infringement of the rights of the minority communities. The comment on someone?s sexuality which does not reflect the norm of the society is not only an attack on an individual rather a direct attack to the entire community of individuals whose sexuality is beyond their control, in fact, is a violation of their fundamental right to dignity and respect.
?
"The concept of democracy is structured on the principles of?rule of law"
Another interesting component of the president?s speech was the explicit use of references regarding? culture and tradition in order to convince the audience present at the meeting that his political opponent represented more of the western culture. Which points a finger at the very identity of Sri Lanka, and its culture, seeming to imply that the LGBTQ people reflect the culture of the west. The funny part about the concept of culture is that it represents the dominant opinion of the society which does not necessarily mean it is moral, ethical or right. It should be stated that traces of non-heterosexual behaviours could be identified throughout the history of Sri Lanka and it is the? dominant ideologies of the colonial rulers that marked such individuals and activities as taboo. Ironically at present our past colonizes are legalizing and fighting for the rights of the LGBTQ communities while we are fixated on their outdated ideologies. Maybe it is time our leaders realize that the LGBTQ community and other sensitive social issues and topics should not be used as tools of political advancement any longer and it is time to restore the rights of these communities that they duly deserve.??

Stop Tinkering with the Constitution - EDITORIAL
	
?
he Constitution of a country is supposed to be the bedrock of the rule of law in a given country. Unfortunately for Sri Lanka, the constitution had been tinkered with on many an occasion. The Constitution of the country - the third since independence and the second Republican Constitution - has been tinkered with and trampled underfoot by the leaders of all governing political parties all of whom have vowed to protect and defend it.
During its brief 40-year life span commencing on September 7, 1978, the Constitution of our country has been tinkered with 19 times. What is sad, is that on most occasions the Amendments brought in were not to enhance the rule of law or to provide greater freedom to the people but rather to enhance the power of the rulers. For instance, just four years after the promulgation of the 1978 Constitution, the then ruling clique barelled the 4th Amendment (Extension of term of first Parliament) through parliament, using the then ruling party?s 5/6th majority in the House, to ensure its continued majority in parliament. More recently we saw government using a variety of delaying tactics, again using selective readings from the Constitution to delay the holding of elections, this time Provincial Council elections.
As recently as April 28, 2015, in the aftermath of the presidential election, the new regime rushed in the 19th Amendment to the Constitution to annul the 18th Amendment while replacing the defunct 17th Amendment to establish the Independent Commissions and remove the Executive Presidential powers and limit the term of office of the President to five years; while the President continues to function as the Head of State, Head of the Cabinet, and Head of Security Forces.?
The amendment rushed in, obviously without much attention to detail, has spawned another crisis.?
Since the sitting president, sacked his Prime Minister and appointed another in his stead, our parliamentarians have been on offer to be bought and sold allegedly for large sums of money or plum political office. Today they are busy misrepresenting and misquoting particular sections of the Constitution to suit different political agendas.
The wishes of the people who voted these parliamentarians from different political parties into power are given scant concern, as politicians rush hither and thither to see how they can?better themselves.?
Meanwhile the country is being drawn into yet another unnecessary crisis. The 4th Amendment to the Constitution - to arbitrarily extend the life of parliament without holding elections - gave birth to the JVP uprising, leading to a bloodbath which left thousands dead. Thousands more disappeared, society as a whole was brutalized and the economy left in a shambles.
Sri Lankans coming out of a brutal near-three-decade-long war were and are still war-weary. They saw the crushing of terrorism as a chance to reconcile with one another as well as a chance to rebuild the economy and provide better opportunities for future generations. But the political crisis, leading to the decision to dissolve parliament as questions were raised on the required numbers to show a majority in parliament, smacks of political opportunism.?
The formation of a caretaker government, which opponents insist is unconstitutional, has the potential to engineer unrest if not much worse. The announcement of the date for the holding of elections, the dates for the closing of nominations and the summoning of the new parliament to meet on January 17 without reference to the Elections Commissioner does not bode well for the future.
Meanwhile, the economy of the country is struggling to cope with debt repayment and a burgeoning trade imbalance. Hopes that direct foreign investment would bring in sufficient capital to overcome some of these problems are rapidly fading. The incipient tourist industry which was expected to bring in invaluable foreign exchange could face problems.?
If ?we, the people? and our politicians do not get together and put country before self and political party needs, our country and economy will decline rapidly.?

UNF will form new alliance to save the nation: Ranil
	
 UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe said today the UNF and other political parties will together form a new alliance with a new face to pull the nation out of the present crisis and urged all parties to join this new political force.
?It is not possible to build up a nation through undemocratic and destructive means. We will not allow anyone to destroy this nation which we have managed to safeguard at the risk of our lives. I promise to pull this nation through the present curse by associating myself in a new and a broad alliance. Therefore I invite everyone to join this new political force,? Mr. Wickremesinghe said in a special statement last evening.?
Mr. Wickremesinghe also said the following in his statement: ?Our country is facing a complex and unfortunate crisis. There is a breakdown of morals, democracy and the rule of law. This crisis will destroy our country and our children's future. This is not about who will be Prime Minister (PM), or who will be a minister, or who will run the government. This is about safeguarding democracy and the sovereignty of the nation.
?In 2015, the people gave us a mandate for good governance; to end the Rajapaksa rule and build a democratic and civilized society. The two main parties united to fulfil this mandate. We strengthened democracy, stabilized the economy, and began debt repayment. Through programmes like ?Gam Peraliya? we empowered the people. We were on the right track to build a society without fear or doubt. But this is being destroyed now.
?I have faced many challenges. I have been criticized and ridiculed. But we faced these challenges patiently while upholding the people's mandate. As a result, the country benefited in the last three-and-a-half years. This was not easy. But look at the disruption caused to the country in the last two weeks.
?I have always worked towards safeguarding democracy. I have never thought of my self-interests in politics. I gave up being a presidential candidate. I rejected LTTE overtures to associate with them in 2005 as I did not want to jeopardize the nation for personal gain. I strived to safeguard democracy then, and I am prepared to do so now.
?On 26 October, the President took unconstitutional measures against the people's mandate. He attempted to transfer power to those rejected by the people. He prorogued parliament. Under article 42(4), the President must appoint as PM, the person who commands the confidence of the House.
?A total 116 MPs informed the Speaker that the President's actions were illegal. They said the person appointed as PM must demonstrate that he commands a majority in the House. The Indian Parliament has taken such steps on several occasions. I faced and defeated a no-confidence motion in April, and proved I had the confidence of the House. But the President dissolved parliament, despite fixing dates to convene it.
?The President talked about 'buying' MPs. He knows about this best because he wooed UNP and TNA MPs with portfolios. People have lost faith in MPs due to this unfortunate situation.
?The President also warned there could be killings if the House convened. Parliament has faced tense moments, in our country and in other countries, but there have been no killings. The House is controlled by the Speaker, and he maintains order. The Speaker met party leaders recently and there was no talk of killings. The President should have informed the Speaker if he knew of any planned killings. Instead, he took a stubborn decision. The country's image has been tarnished, and we have lost international credibility.
?We are currently holding discussions to build a broad alliance to save the country from this crisis. The UNF will form a new alliance and come before the people with a new face. The youth are frustrated by the current situation. We will work towards saving the nation from this unfortunate situation. We will introduce a constitution that will strengthen democracy. We will face any challenge to safeguard democracy, the rule of law, decency and the sovereignty of the people. Let?s unite and fight to save our country from falling under the control of a dictatorial regime." (Yohan Perera)

UNP weak to face polls: SLPP
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said today that the United National Party (UNP) would have to go for a snap General Election on a weak position as it was making every possible effort to postpone the polls.
Addressing a press conference, SLPP Chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris said it had been the habit of the UNP to postpone elections.
He said the UNP delayed the elections to the Local Authorities, and the elections to the Provincial Councils were not yet conducted.
Instead, he said his party was enthusiastic about elections and wished to go before people seeking a mandate.
Prof. Peiris said his party decided to intervene in the petitions filed by some parties seeking to annul the dissolution of Parliament. (Kelum Bandara)
