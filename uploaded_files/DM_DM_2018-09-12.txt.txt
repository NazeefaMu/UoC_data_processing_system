Cake Convention by Reema Siraj
	
The Cake Convention, a momentous event and the first of its kind, took place in Sri Lanka, on August 18th in the prestigious Hilton Colombo. Hosted by Dubai based cake artist and entrepreneur, ReemaSiraj, this illustrious gathering was an event aimed at expanding connections, far and wide, within the baking industry in SriLanka.
Being a SriLankan citizen who lives abroad, Reema noticed something quite outstanding, in the rest of the world, networking within communities was a huge concept and a viral trend in every industry including the baking world! But here, she sensed there was a huge void in that aspect. There was no real interface where bakers could connect with one another and share ideas. Determined to strengthen the affiliation of bakers from all areas of the country, Reema set out to create a platform on which professionals and amateurs alike could display there creativity to one another in a poignant setting.
Its safe to say the cake convention as we know it today, has evolved and proliferated far beyond its humble beginnings. Just over a year ago, cake talks was a simple gathering of around 20 ladies that came from all walks of the baking industry. Through the course of conversation, exchanging of pleasantries and playing of games they realised that they had so much to share with one another and each of them had something unique and special to contribute to the event. This inspired Reema to nurture this kind of connecting further and stem this breathtaking opportunity out to as many people as possible.
With the support of her organisersElegante& Co. and its co-founder Carl De Silva, Who has also been credited for being the driving force behind this events success, she created a group of strong minded women who were equally ambitious in making this glittering event a notable occasion. Undoubtedly, her sponsors,(Platinum sponsor) Spectra bakery solutions, (gold sponsors) Fonterra Brand, Homelux and (silver sponsor) AB Mauri Lanka, were at the forefront of all the exhilaration. The sponsors were able to showcase their amazing cakes, bakeware and other products and services to the guests in an impeccably organised hallway dedicated to browsing and showcasing talent.
The event kicked off at 3pm and was initiated with an inspirational speech by RukshiNethicumara, the owner of one of Sri Lankas cake hotspots, Butter Boutique. After calling it quits from her mothers business, Rukshi set out to find her own path, Baking! What is now one of the most sought-after bakeries in Sri Lanka, started at the back of a garage in 2009. Endless attempts at perfecting her baking skills and a flurry of positive support from her friends, family and customers, inspired her to open her very first bakery on Flower road in 2015! Since then her business and baking skills have from strength to strength and she now has three coveted bakeries scattered around Colombo. She ended her speech with two secrets to success. Firstly she insisted that maintaining quality consistently is the secret to success regardless of the field. Secondly she pressed on the importance of positivity and surrounding yourself with supportive people, to build an effective barrier from the hate and scorn success brings from negative people, as its even easier for trolls nowadays with social media being a major platform for their discern.
The second person to take the stage was Chammarie Daniel, the proud owner and founder of Savys Cakes. This Self taught artist was one who had a hidden flair for creating life like sculptures that was enhanced when she merged it with her baking skills. While demonstrating on stage, her unique techniques to achieve real ness in her work, Chammarie told the audience of how she discovered that figurines and sculptures, especially those that represent the client themselves, was an extremely niche market in SriLanka, but one that had a lot of potential. She went on to describe how she taught herself everything she knows through trial and error. She emphasised the importance of creating the perfect smile, with contours for lips and teeth on a figurine, as this is the factor that makes or breaks the realistic effect of a face. She demonstrated how small things like brush strokes and mixing mediums for colour can make a huge difference to the vulnerable art of sculpting. Chammarie finished her demonstrations and speech by advising emerging artists of the essence of practice makes perfect.
The third speaker of the day was SumeyaThawoos, owner and founder of Baked with Love. She is a mother, a student and works an eight-to-five job all while managing her thriving baking business.
Inspired by her lecturer, Sumeya searched within herself to find her aptitude for baking and soon went on to pursue it as a career and develop it into her own business. She went on to credit the uniqueness of her work to the fact that she takes inspiration from her surroundings, people and even her emotions, rather can copy someone elses work. She deems such copying to be a great obstacle in the way of a bakers success. She also expressed her discern at the fact that some bakers take it one step further and actually steal another persons work to call it their own. Copyright is something that hasnt been stressed enough in the baking industry in SriLanka, so she pressed on the significance of giving due credit if you do have to copy someone elses work upon the demand of a client. Touching back on the subject of drawing inspiration, Sumeya showed us one of her cakes that had been inspired by one of sarees of Aslam Hussain, whom she personally met to retrieve the themes based in this shared and root out the moods behind his designs. She ended her inspiring speech with a few words of advice; See the good in anothers work and do the best to understand why you think its good.
Rubeena Ibrahim was the fourth speaker of the evening. A world renowned baker and the founder and host of Cake Talk in Dubai. She too started from humble beginnings. An inundated wife and mother of three, who had the apparent stresses of an expat woman who has to juggle so many different lifestyles in a country far from home, where daily support is minimal. But being the enthusiasts she is, and in a leap of faith, Rubeena introduced baking to her life as well. With the help and support of her friends and family Rubys cakes took flight despite her struggles and never-ending commitments However one of the biggest hurdles in the way of her growth was the fact that home baking was illegal in Oman and there was no platform for bakers who worked from their homes. She decided something had to be done and this is when the idea of cake talk was conceived in her mind. It was to be the ideal seminar where bakers could display their wonderful work and share ideas. Initially her ideas were deemed too ambitious and unrealistic, but despite these criticisms, Rubeena went on to plan her first event and to her surprise in 2015, just weeks before the event, huge brands such as Lurpak Arabia, Malabar Gold and Betty Crocker has approached her with sponsor offers and the event was a massive success! This is when Rubeenarealised, no dream is too big and success depends on how you perceive it! She ended her speech with an inspirational piece of advice; Build the dream and the dream will build you!
With this the first segment of the event drew to a close! The guests were given an opportunity to mingle with one other and the sponsors stationed in the hallway.
After the networking session, ReemaSiraj took the stage to give a demonstration of her signature roses. She shared tips and tricks on how to make a realistic looking rose. Due to time constraints she was only able to show audience how to make a rose bud. Some of her tips for starting included, using styrofoam to keep the centre light, wiring it from across rather than under, and using the correct consistency of gum paste. Once the base was ready she demonstrated how a petal should be carved with utmost care, starting by rolling it very thin on a foam base and using metal tools with the correct shape to achieve a real life texture. She then went on to show the audience how to build the calyx of the flower, by placing them very close together and stressing the importance of knotting the bud and creating thorns using floral tape all in the effort of maintains a realistic appeal. While the audience passed the finished rose bud along for observation, She advised how this method of petal making can be applied to the rest of rose, just by increasing the size each time the petal is supposed to grow in size.
Next, a small game session was held. Where two teams of five went into an epic cupcake battle. The winning team got free entrance passes to the next Cake Convention which will be held next year.
After a short presentation by anchor food proffessionals, about the differences between dairy and non dairy whipping creams, the last speaker of the evening FathimaNazrunNasoordeen, the owner and founder of Scrumptious Cups took to the stage. ReemaSiraj referred to her as the 'Buttercream Queen' because of her seamless talents in decorating cakes with buttercream. She demonstrated and shred important tips on how to make perfect buttercream cake including ideas such as refrigerating the cake before and using thicker layers as a pose to the more popular thin layers. She also advised how having bowl of hot of water by your side will help with keeping the tools tidy during the decorating process and result in a cleaner finish She ended the demonstration with a simple floral decoration and stated that going simple makes the cake look more elegant than overwhelming it with flowers.
Evening ended with a sit down interview of ReemaSiraj where we were able to learn so much about her he exhilarating experiences she has had over the course of a few years. After telling us about how this idea was born and how it grew (which we have addressed in the the beginning of he article) she went on to share her plans for the future. When asked about how she was going to expand this event in the coming years she replied My future plans will definitely involve something international, I think our young bakers have a real potential to excel on global scale. I want our ladies to become confident enough to take there work out of this comfort zone and show it off to the rest of the world, we maybe a small country but I think we have grown from strength to strength in the past few years and its high time the baking industry started to take flight! I dont know, maybe our cake convention will happen in Dubai as well soon!
The interviewer went on to ask her more about her personal life and how she grew into the person she i today. When asked in regards to this, Reema replied; Before my baking career took off, I was a fairly ordinary person. For eight years I was a kindergarten teacher, after which I proceeded to be a lecturer for early childhood education. After marriage I moved to Dubai with my husband and I am now a proud mother of three and an aspiring international cake artist.
But I must say Cakes have been an inherent part of my life for many years now. I grew up watching my mother bake cakes for weddings and birthdays and soon started to pick up on the fine techniques involved in cake decoration. As a child I would often admire the attention to detail required when it comes to pristine cake decorating, although I never realised I would pursue it as a career I always had a passion for this kind of artistry. As my children started growing I often found myself making cakes for birthdays and occasions, and every time I would thoroughly enjoy the experience. This is when I seriously started consider expanding my decorating skills.
Her biggest piece of advice was to master the art of time management before anything else! Everybody has the same 24 hours in a day, but how you use it defines you!
With this, Reema went on to thank the people who were so supportive of her throughout this process, her friends, family, colleagues and sponsors. She relayed her gratitude to every member in the room, who helped make a dream a reality!
The event came to an end with a huge raffle draw, where all the sponsors, the speakers and other brands gave passes for free master classes, baking utensils, gift baskets and many more. The Cake Convention marked a turning point in the industry of baking in Sri Lanka and will return next year, bigger and better.

Contribution of education towards  national reconciliation
	
Commemorating the 50th Death Anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.

Luther King Jr.

.Having a bitter experience of the thirty-year-old war, we have come to feel the need of national reconciliation. This has been so often expressed by the countrys present leaders. When discussing national reconciliation, Martin Luther King Jr., an American civil society activist, plays an important role in his views. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to look at how the education system of a country can be responded to in the exercise of national reconciliation. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. (1929-1968) was an American clergyman and Nobel Prize winner and one of the principal leaders of the American civil rights movement and a prominent advocate of nonviolent protest. Kings challenges to segregation and racial discrimination in the 1950s and 1960s helped to convince many white Americans to support the cause of civil rights in the United States. After his assassination in 1968, King became a symbol of protest in the struggle for racial justice. 

They relate to educational content, language policy and teacher training

The most memorable speech of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., from his life as an activist, I Have a Dream, was delivered August 28, 1963 before more than 200,000 people in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. as part of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.
The main message of the speech is that we should consolidate rights and freedom of human beings. It means every person in a society must be recognised as a human being and should have equal opportunities to education and other matters and the basis of reconciliation is equality and humanity. The sub messages of the speech are how important the principles of racial equality and nonviolent, social change, social justice, and human dignity to fulfilled Martin Luther Kings vision of the country as a place of true equality. Our world is becoming smaller and ever more interdependent with the rapid growth of technology and increasing contact between people and governments. In this light, it is important to reassess the rights and responsibilities of individuals, people and nations in relation to each other and to the worldas a whole.
Kings was a vision of a completely integrated society, a community of love and justice wherein brotherhood would be a reality in all of social life. In his mind, such a community would be the ideal corporate expression Integration, as King understood it, is much more inclusive and positive than desegregation. Desegregation is essentially negative in that it eliminates discrimination whereas desegregation can be brought about by laws; integration requires a change in attitudes. It involves personal and social relationships that are created by love and these cannot be legislated. Once segregation has been abolished and desegregation accomplished, blacks and whites will have to learn to relate to each other across those non rational, psychological barriers which have traditionally separated them in their society. His assumption that human existence is social in nature, the solidarity of the human family is the most important factor. Liberalism and individualism provided its theoretical and philosophical foundations, and nonviolence the means to attain it. A Vision of Total Relatedness with a stagnant equality of sameness Stanza of the civil rights movements, the concept of brotherhood to a vision of total interrelatedness and meaningful relationships with other persons. The civil rights movement provides Justice for Everyone Obviously. The mankind of the future in this moment of luminous and genuine brotherhood In Kings view, the interrelatedness of human existence means that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.

How to respond to the ideas of Martin Luther King
The great majority of countries worldwide can be characterised as multi-ethnic or multi-cultural societies. Countries are either multi-ethnic because their societies are naturally composed of different ethnic group (majority and minority groups, including indigenous populations), or because they have experienced long-standing migration. Education systems within any country have been planed and constructed to forge identities and foster loyalties, but also have the potential or either easing or exacerbating ethnic conflict through the way, it is organized and delivered to different ethnic groups. The school is where life chances are distributed-often unequally and thus may either favour or hamper social mobility of different ethnic groups.

It is important to reassess the rights and responsibilities of individuals

This is why the policy forum explored three different models of organising education systems for addressing ethnic and cultural diversity in terms of their intellectual roots and philosophy, as well as their principles of organization and implementation: (a) the integration model where individual merit which was gained by personally, decides personal future; (b) the multicultural model whereby diverse groups  both migrant and indigenous  cultivate differences within the same unitary system in terms of language of instruction and ethnically sensitive content; and (c) the parallel model whereby different segments of the school system are designed to cater to different linguistic or ethnic groups. 
These are the three particular areas where policy-makers and educational planers can make a difference in the context of multi-ethnicity. They relate to educational content, language policy and teacher training. With regard to educational content, the policy forum discussed whether there should be a single universal set of content for all students, or if there is room for specificity of content relating to the various ethnic groups. In other words, they need to be prepared for teaching in an environment that is very different from the one in which they themselves went to school, and one that is continually adapting to the changing demography.

The main message of the speech is that we should consolidate rights and freedom of humanbeings

Therefore, beyond the elaborate structures of system of education, a key consideration for democracies is the strength of education institutions to prevail over private or non-state actors, from corporations to warlords. Also, education is to have an impact on societies that face ethnic and cultural diversity, it is the society that has to consciously accept such diversity and work towards assimilating the diverse cultural and different ethnicities in to the main national stream and so only can have such societies to create a truly effective plural educational system. This is the only way to make the Dream of Martin Luther King, a reality.

Envoys protest day sprint ends at a hospital!
	

A city-based envoy from a powerful country in the West had had occasion to face an unusual predicament on the day of JOs massive protest.

This envoy known to be an academic well versed in Buddhism as well as in this countrys long history had made it a practice to do workouts every morning. He would do jogging on some days and sprinting and cycling on other days.
On the day of the protest, the diplomat, a Colombo 7 resident, had come the street to do a sprint to find the entire area looking desolate and all his usual workout streets barricaded as part of a traffic diversion plan.
So, he had begun sprinting along a lane and a dog chasing him had bitten him on the leg.
Highly frightened, the diplomat who had never suffered a dog bite in his lifetime, nevertheless, continued his sprint with a new burst of speed until he had reached a private nursing home.
The envoy had returned home in an official vehicle after getting his wound dressed and the anti-rabies vaccine injected hoping against hope to resume his morning workout in a day or two, they say.

Friend  or foe in politics
	
The question is posed as to what was achieved during this show given the money spent by MR (phot AFP)

British left our shores in 1948 bequeathing two loved institutions - parliamentary democracy and the game of cricket. Parliamentary democracy and cricket though ruined by over zealous politicised locals, yet added value to a decadent colonial structure. 
The title of the President under the 1972 Constitution was ceremonial in the workings and ritualistic in nature. J.R. Jayewardene, with a 5/6 majority in Parliament, desired to vest executive power on equal proportion to the strength vested on him by the voters. This made the office of the President omnipotent from 1978 onward. 
The prime ministerial post was downgraded to that of an office peon. The president played the role of a mighty Goliath. Such was the glory associated with the post. Two previous incumbents of two terms - who desired to run for office for the third time - unofficially are debarred by the JVP insurrection and orders of the Supreme Court. Avarice for office was present among its holders from the beginning. 
Simple; the greed to secure permanency made the two-time president Mahinda Rajapaksa (MR) revised the Constitution [18A] to give him an opportunity to gamble on his fortunes. Since MR could not make it its unlikely any other would make this change so that a president who held the post twice can have a third term.
The fame and affection MR derived, by defeating terrorism, was immense with the populace in the south the jewel in his crown. Yet sadly he had to preside over a corrupt and decadent Government. MR was overwhelmed by a corrupt regime and never sought to clean it. 

The 18th Amendment carries wisdom in a country devoid of sufficient leadership material. Fair enough, the decision of continuation was eventually left in the hands of the people.

Old faces will form the next administration if MR is elected. He is familiar with party veterans or children of kinsmen. People may have to live under worse conditions with likely economic upheavals. They may take to the streets voluntarily without food or booze and remember the lessons learned during the showdown sponsored by MR. It was a disciplined show that made the bystander indecisive. The question is posed as to what was achieved during this show given the money spent by MR Was this money spent to make Gota look feeble 
The focus is now on the 20th Amendment. Not being able to draft the 20 Amendment in English, the JVP adopted NGO folk and left-minded church oriented forces. They took cover under the JVP, without the saffron shield held previously under Rev. Sobitha in 2015 for protection. All the good work done by JVP over the years may evaporate if monks enter the scene to preserve the role of a future President. 
The 18th Amendment carries wisdom in a country devoid of sufficient leadership material. Fair enough, the decision of continuation was eventually left in the hands of the people. They shot down MR by outvoting him and swept the 18th amendment out of the rule-book. Blame the same people as much as MR, being convinced - in believing he is a mighty king that did no wrong and on this false premise simpleton Mahinda ruled as a despot would, while his family made merry. This family suffers to date, deservingly for doing wrong. 
MR, the despot, sincerely loved his country and his countrymen, but cared little for national assets, allowing it to be plundered. The present Government thrives on the errors of the last; so would the next government MR from 2015 has not learned much from errors committed or the company he keeps and appears to be greedy for offices of power around him. Hopefully is not as stupid as the learned Professor of Law (I know the law) in seeking a third term from the Supreme Court which cannot grant it, having not challenged it before the enactment of 19 A, should gracefully settle for the Prime Ministers post, leaving the more powerful Presidency to Gota - an attractive fresh old familiar face among the old and ugly. Gota is sadly surrounded by the evil names of the last regime and finds it hard to discard them, being entrenched, calls for an downfall. 

His time was up
Third occupier of office in 2005 and 2009 of two terms, Mahinda Rajapaksa realised his time was up - made it a bottomless pit by the 18th Amendment. He overestimated his popularity in overcoming dreaded terrorism, attained affection of a divine proportion in the South, yet, left it at the discretion of the people of extending his term of office. That was not to be: The people did not desire to give him a third term. If MR, loved immensely, failed in an attempted third, any other in the future will do likewise. Leave it as a safe and sure route for a graceful retirement for a two term President. 
The present Government is unlikely to obtain a second term and has made life extremely hard and uncaring for the voters. MR undoubtedly did better, after breaking the back of northern terrorism, with the reduced security providing partial satisfaction to an insecure society that uplifted a dormant economy. 
Did MR, after defeat, realise that he did not acquire as many votes as Chandrika did, after her first term of office; maimed at the hands of the LTTE while her main rivals were killed in assassination bids MR never realised that he failed to carry the minority votes after defeating terrorism; something which Chandrika did after her first term in office. MR established by his defeat in 2015 that no other could aspire for a third term without a substantial section of the minority votes without corruption and poor governance-pleased none; lost the confidence of the North and East densely populated with the minorities, with it his third term. He could not carry the South as he did in 2005 and 2010 comprehensively with huge majorities to offset losses elsewhere. 
If MR runs for a third term as President instead of forwarding a new candidate and fails to find an honest team to make the dynamic changes in 2020 he may be termed a lame duck in record time. If this happens crowds may take to the streets and initiate a revolution of a unknown colour.

The winner is determined by the floating middle vote. Question is whether they will vote substantially for MR or stay at home or spoil their votes orvote for the JVP 

Government desiring a return to office should have left the third term open as contemplated in the 18th Amendment - leaving Gotabhaya- the fastest rising candidate for the office of Presidency, out of contention. The demand would have been, in such a circumstance, for MR to obviously seek Presidency for the third time. Doesnt MR combining with Gota make them a more formidable outfit Provided the powers of the Presidency is not emasculated and makes way for a resurrection of another insurrection by a road show after a JO style satyagraha with or without the JVP. The recent road show was an attempt to display to the public that MR is the top dog. Gota was presented as an insignificant character and this was accepted by him tamely. Gota showed a kid brother mentality saluting the maestro.

Balancing powers
Much is owed to him for defeating the LTTE not forgetting the stupidity of JR who made the President an over-bearing object. The need is to have a President from the 1978 constitution and a Prime Minister from the 1972 constitution with powers being balanced. An amended 19th or a helpful 20th can keep the equilibrium alive of both offices which is badly needed for checks and balances and exchange of power between the holders of such offices meaningfully. We would never have won the war and the JVP insurrection unless the President held executive power. Pleasing the minorities is game the UNP and the NGOs desire. Is that the game plan of the JVP, now in the arms of the NGOs
Combined UNP/JVP sponsored 20th Amendment drawn by the church based NGO units hope to eliminate the supra powers granted to the President by the JRJ Constitution of 1978. This is the litmus test to determine whether MR will sail with the proposed 20th or try to demolish it or will he sheepishly visit another country and absent himself during the debate. 
Very few realise that there are five mounds of vote banks (A) SLFP (now split between the two fractions within the SLFP with Sirisena being presently insignificant) (B) monolithic UNP (C) TNA powerful in the North/East mildly divided with the entrance of Wigneswaran (D) Undecided Floating voter (E) thin cadres of the JVP with an evaporating vote bank (f) Muslim voters stay with a winner unless extremist gets into the act. 
The winner is determined by the floating middle vote. Question is whether they will vote substantially for MR or stay at home or spoil their votes or vote for the JVP Results at the Provincial Council are the best readers. Will it be held for the said reason 
Where should Gota stand First chum, convince the voters by jettisoning the dual citisenship and you are a rightful candidate. Sorry, you may otherwise be a footnote!

Governor rules out purchase of expensive chairs
	
The purchase of chairs invoiced at Rs. 644,000 each for the use of the new Western Provincial Council Chamber had been completely stopped by the Western Province Governor Hema Kumara Nanayakkara basing on allegations that there had been an irregularity in the process of procurement of these chairs.
The Governors attention has also been drawn to the fact that with the termination of this purchase if there arises any loss , such loss is to be recovered from those who were involved in this matter .
The committee which was appointed to inquire into this purchase of luxury chairs for the council had reported many errors in the procurement process and the governor on an earlier occasion stated to the media that he is hopeful in summoning all parties responsible and questioning them. Accordingly whole of yesterday the Governor had discussed with officials who were serving in various units and public representatives in order to ascertain whether there were any shortcomings in the procurement process.

Govt. will proceed with the Tech City: Minister
	
Despite the organized protest campaigns led by the civil societies and the interested political parties, the Megapolis Ministry will continue with the construction of technology cities, Daily Mirror learns.
On Tuesday, the Movement for protecting Homagama People's Rights carried out a protest march from the Fort Railway Station against the Technological City Development Project that is to be launched in the areas like Malabe, Athurugiriya, Kaduwela, and Homagama.
It was observed that the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) members led by its Convener Lahiru Weerasekara were commanding the rally.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka said that through the project there will be a huge revolution in the countrys economy.
I strongly deny any claim of negativity to the people, the area or the country through this project. Some quarry owners and the Front Line Socialist Party with political motives are behind these moves. Inter University student movements are provoking the residents of the area against this. When we explained the benefit of the project, the residents agreed with us, Minister Ranawaka explained.
He further said that technology faculties belong to four state universities, a space centre, Nanotechnology Institute and many other research and knowledge centres would be established in the area under the project.
Minister revealed that the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank had agreed to develop the infrastructure facilities in the area while the entire design plan was done by the Korean project authorities for free of charge.
As such Ranawaka said that it is the residents and the youth of the country who will benefit of this project. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

International Criminal Court is already dead to us
	

Americas long-running reluctant relationship with the International Criminal Court came to a crashing halt on Monday as decades of U.S. suspicions about the tribunal and its global jurisdiction spilled into open hostility, amid threats of sanctions if it investigates U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
National security adviser John Bolton denounced the legitimacy of The Hague-based court, which was created in 2002 to prosecute war crimes and crimes of humanity and genocide in areas where perpetrators might not otherwise face justice. It has 123 state parties that recognize its jurisdiction.
The International Criminal Court unacceptably threatens American sovereignty and U.S. national security interests, Bolton told the Federalist Society, a conservative Washington-based think tank. Bolton also took aim at Palestinian efforts to press war crime charges against Israel for its policies in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza.
He said the U.S. would use any means necessary to protect Americans and citizens of allied countries, like Israel, from unjust prosecution by this illegitimate court. The White House said that to the extent permitted by U.S. law, the Trump administration would ban ICC judges and prosecutors from entering the United States, sanction their funds in the U.S. financial system and prosecute them in the U.S. criminal system.
We will not cooperate with the ICC, Bolton said, adding that for all intents and purposes, the ICC is already dead to us.
It was an extraordinary rebuke decried by human rights groups who complained it was another Trump administration rollback of U.S. leadership in demanding accountability for gross abuses.

Is duo to stage a comeback for a reunion
	

A rumour doing rounds in political circles says that the Sports portfolio is going to change hands again.

However, it is an old face that is coming back to the same place after doing a full circle in the political theatre. By the way, this rumour is said to have been set afloat by none other than a city-based politico with a vested interest in the gentlemens game now pushed out of the scene.
Both the old face and the city-based politico have been weathering many a storm together under the same umbrella at one time.
The city-based politico had reportedly worked hard behind the scene to clear the way for the old face, incidentally a young star from Wayamba to get back the familiar portfolio. He is these days going around telling his old pals in the gentlemens game that his colleagues return to the sports portfolio will signal his own re-entry into the scene, they say.

ITS HOBSONS CHOICE  FOR THE UNP
	
Why the UNP needs the same coalition to win at the 2020 Presidential Election

Real generosity towards the future lies in giving all to the present.
Albert Camus

The candidate of the UNP has no chance at the forthcoming Presidential Election
	Coalition partners- Maha Sangha, Civil Organizations and Maithripala-led SLFP absent
	The Political entity created by SWRD seems to be nearing its end

How and what Ranil Wickremesinghe is strategizing is anyones guess. But given the mans shrewd yet hereunto unsuccessful attempts at being seen as a winner, if Ranil Wickremesinghe is the candidate from the United National Party (UNP), only by being triumphant at elections can he be established as a successful politician.
A close analysis of the Presidential Elections held up to date, would reveal that, given the progressive erosion of the UNP vote base since 1994, a candidate representing the Grand Old Party of Sri Lanka without the willful and proactive assistance of the other members of the grand coalition that got together in 2015, he or she representing the UNP alone would have no chance whatsoever at the forthcoming Presidential Election in 2020.
To further illustrate this argument, I submit the tables.


Now let us see these results in a line chart:


The UNP candidate by himself scored over 50% only in 1982 and 1988. In 2015, the UNP-backed candidate, Maithripala Sirisena the current President, scored barely over 50% with the backing of a carefully established anti-Rajapaksa coalition, spearheaded by the late Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera and a fair number of Buddhist, Christian, Hindu and Muslim clergy.
Maithripala, himself could boast only of the Polonnaruwa District while districts where Sinhalese Buddhists dominated, especially the Deep South, the hinterland of Moneragala, Ratnapura, Kalutara and Anuradhapura overwhelmingly chose the corrupt Rajapaksas.
Ever since the demise of Sobitha Thera, the Buddhist element of that anti-Rajapaksa coalition has nothing but the adamant and vocal denunciation of the governance and government of that coalition run by the duo of Maithripala and Ranil.
The recently held Local Government elections exposed the miserably deficient political and social awareness of those who run the two factions of the
coalition Government.
The scandalous Bond-Scam precipitated the latent fissures in the coalition to surface out, and the potential breakup of a delicately-bonded relationship between Ranil and Maithripala threatened to demolish all hopes and expectations of those who loyally supported thecoalition government.
Ironically enough, both Ranil Wickremesinghe and Maithripala Sirisena seem to be bogged down in losing attempts at buttressing the positions in their respective parties, UNP and SLFP.
Absent a charismatic leadership at the top, the United National Party meandered towards certain defeat at the local government elections in 2018.
The ember that was oozing to attract a mere flicker of flame to catch uncontrollable fire was rekindled in the UNP.
The leadership of Ranil Wickremesinghe is being talked about in closed circles of the UNP, although those who whisper about such a change in leadership dare not come out in the open solely because they are in power.
Those who are seriously concerned about the fate of their Grand Old Party would not gamble; the powerful portfolios they hold within the government ranks and the glory of being close to the throne, access to the coffers and power-machinery of Government seem to have affirmed the age-old saying that those in power will not allow any potential damage to that power.
It is that power and its grip on their life and their political journey that keeps them from speaking or taking action against the current leadership of the UNP.
That indeed is a tragic circumstance in any political dynamic, anywhere else in the world. Whatever the field or subject they disagree on, they always agree that they should remain in power, at least for the time being. Shortsighted allegiance to the raw elements of power precludes them from being adventurous and daring!
Now, have a peep into the following line chart that also includes the recently held Local Government elections as an expression of the voters in a Presidential Election for ease of comparison.


The picture is alarmingly precarious. There is no way a UNP candidate by him or herself could secure any respectable second position at a Presidential Election.
With the virtual departure of Maithripala Sirisena from the coalition that defeated the Rajapaksas in 2015 and the dismal performance of the traditional Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) led by President Sirisena, the emerging blooming of the Pohottuwa, pun intended, seems to overshadow any partner in the currentcoalition Government.
If this reality does not penetrate the closed mindset of the inner-conclaves of the current UNP leadership, they are indeed in for a sure and pathetic performance at the next Presidential Election.
If they want to be successful, the UNP needs to get the same coalition-forces that propelled Maithripala to Presidency. What are those forces and who are the most qualified and deserving candidates who could muster such a force
Non-UNP partners in the coalition:

1. The Maha Sangha
2. Civil Organizations
3. Maithripala-led SLFP
It is almost certain that Maithripala Sirisena has written himself off of the UNP-led coalition candidacy. The gulf between the President and the coalition forces that empowered him is widening by the day.
That sad and lamentable story is behind us. No notable political mind seems to be preoccupied with the nuances of the breakup. The Maha Sanghas backing for a UNP-backed coalition candidate is almost absent. Although the incarceration of the notorious Galagodaaththe Gnanasara failed to galvanize an anti-UNP wave in the country, the results of the Local Government elections show a marked loss for the UNP amongst the Sinhala-Buddhist voting bloc.
Ranil Wickremesinghe being at the helm of his party seems an enormous disadvantage for the attraction of any more Sinhalese Buddhists than what is already there. However, one of the biggest plusses Ranil enjoys is his being accepted and trusted, at least by the leadership, of the Tamil community in the country. In that particular regard, Ranil has no equal.

Districts where Sinhalese Buddhists dominated, especially the Deep South, the hinterland of Moneragala, Ratnapura, Kalutara and Anuradhapura overwhelmingly chose the corrupt Rajapaksas.

Lack of activity in the pursuit and conclusion of the Rajapaksa-ridden corruption deals weighs heavily on the shaping of minds of the leaders of those civic organizations, which backed Maithripala Sirisenas candidacy in 2015.
These creators of the Yahapalanaya concept are thoroughly frustrated by the lack of activity in the sphere of the pursuit of justice against those who are alleged to have committed corrupt practices of historic proportions.
Apart from the apathy shown by some powerful Cabinet Ministers, what has been apportioned to Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is having a telling effect on the electorate.
The emphasis by Sri Lankas civil organizations whose premier aim is purported to be a peaceful country with social, ethnic and economic harmony cannot be overstated and their visible withdrawal from the Ranil/Maithri Government would amount to a large number of independent voters staying at home come the Election Day.
Furthermore, their agitation-prone activities are now aiming at destabilizing the very government they helped to create.
Maithripala-led SLFP is a very sad story. The political entity created by SWRD Bandaranaike seems to be nearing its end at an exceedingly fast pace.
That elementary constituency of the SLFP seems to have departed, instead of greener pastures, in search of bluer waters- Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). President gambled a lot on his ability to lead an SLFP without the Rajapaksas and he lost very badly.
The SLFP or whatever that is left of it is a far cry from what SWRD launched and unleashed.
In such a wide and varied context of political uncertainty, the only silver line is a faint hope on the part of some UNP stalwarts that a change in leadership of the UNP is in the offing.
Its second tier seems to be well settled and ready but the absence of even one single person to bell the cat, would eventually cost them lock, stock and barrel.
Wishful thinking could be damaging both in the short and long run. It will be harmful in the short run as a damaged and a seemingly un-united party would not be ready for an election.
In the long run, such a change would be treated as a redundancy as everyone would surmise that the train has already left the station! Its a Hobsons Choice, Take it or Leave it.

ITS NOW OR NEVER!!!
	


Open a newspaper today and the many headlines scream at you but our Prime Minister says the crime rate has dropped!!! He goes on to defend the new couple who married at Temple Trees. Perhaps the cost of the hall, which we are now told adjoins Temple Trees was paid, but why then did the invitation -and youve just got to see that invitation to believe it-you need a crane to carry it around!!! It is certainly not flamboyant, tastefully done though, bordering on the exotic!!! Why did the invitation specifically state TEMPLE TREES Perhaps a political dash to add a touch of savoir-faire!!!


The fugitive
Moving on to the practical realities, we are still looking at the fugitive from justice, Mahendran!!! Very correctly, the Colombo Fort Magistrate has asked the Senior Attorney General what is the official status of the Arrest Warrant!!! Mahendrans case could be criminal case par excellence!!! As this column asked before, who does he think he is, to demand documents through Interpol
This is not permitted in criminal cases and it would be necessary for him to furnish an address to receive the documents isnt it So, why doesnt Interpol just grab him Red Notice has been served and he is the first suspect in the Bond Scam, so what are we waiting for Now we have Johnston and two others remanded and thankfully held until completion of the case!!!
It is heartening to note that some justice has been served.
What the President says is absolutely correct, the DEATH SENTENCE should be imposed on all those,who have misused, abused and embezzled state property and public funds!!!
If they make an example of ONE criminal, believe me, any others who are even thinking of doing it will think not once but ten times, or maybe never!!!

Ghost Protocols
The Paathaala Nayakaya, Makandure Madush issuing instructions from Dubai where he is based, has ordered his fathers body to be brought under Police escort to his hometown and a helicopter to scatter flowers at the burial in Sooriyawewa!!! What unmitigated arrogance!!! More importantly, why did the police acquiesce


The sky isthe limit
The horrifying truth about the Scams at SRI LANKAN AIRLINES are mind-boggling like the equally insane salaries their Executives were paid-one of them was getting ONLY RS. 950,000/- A MONTH!!! Over sixteen (16) cases of drugs in possession of Cabin Crew, mostly found on their persons, Foreign Exchange, Liquor pilfered from the airline and other unimaginable pilferings from the airline in general, have gone underground!!! Why were they not prosecuted


The icing on a chaotic cake

Into this chaotic conundrum come the recently awakened Government Veerayas and the sudden positive newspaper headlines now have to be seen to be believed!!! The Veerayas have not only just come awake, theyve come alive!!! Here are some happenings quoted from the Daily News ALONE:

State Literary Awards on September 11
	Parliamentary Select Committee on National Unity
	Salaries Commission begins work
	Paddy Lands to be Surveyed
	Health Statistics to be Digitalized
	3 Wheel Drivers to be Taught Traffic Laws and Penal Code  2 years training
	COPA National Awards for High-Performance State Institutions
	Providing Homes with Dialog to the Flood Affected in Eheliyagoda
	Irrigation Tank Renovations in Anuradhapura
	Development Landscape for Sri Lanka 2025
	Building Strong Sustainable and Equitable Economy
	Enterprise Sri Lanka
	Invigorating Civil Society
	ICING ON THE CAKE  BREAD UP BY RS. 5/-!!!


Organised FLOP
In a society governed passively by free markets and free elections, organized greed always defeats disorganized democracy!!! That is exactly what happened with JANABALAYA last Wednesday!!! One could actually call it an ORGANIZED FLOP!!! While the leaders lounged around in Five Star comfort, the protestors converged in droves, particularly near Lake House, eating, drinking and dancing their cares away because they have more brains in their feet than in their heads!!!

Janabalaya Kolombata and social media disconnect
	

On the night of September 4 or the early hours of 5, some groggy eyed travellers getting into taxis at the Katunayake Airport were given some stern advice. Avoid Colombo, it is going to be absolute mayhem, so said the drivers forewarning that Colombo would grind to an almighty standstill by virtue of a massive protests campaign bythe oppositionSri Lanka PodujanaPeramuna (SLPP) 

Janabalaya Kolombata, the tag line for the protests, masterminded by Namal Rajapaksa was on an impressive marketing campaign at least on social media. Weeks ahead of the day, social media had been mobilized, while grassroots level meetings were taking place in every nook and corner, or so it seemed. 
There were sticker campaigns, poster campaigns and social media had been deployed full throttle. By fifth mid-morning Janabalaya Kolombata looked like the first massive convergence of a social media campaign and a much more traditional grassroots level public mobilization campaign. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has been a past master of public mobilization and his heir apparent was going to show that he was that and much more. 
On social media, Janabalaya was on a different field altogether, on Facebook, the posts with the tag Janabalaya were shared, liked or commented on over 220,000 times by the time the buses with the protestors were reaching the outskirts of Colombo, there were over 8,000 twitter interactions and the tags were trending across social media in Sri Lanka and nothing else was getting even closer. 

It was clear that there was a strategic social media campaign reached its crescendo as the protests were to hit the roads of Colombo  the target was over 200,000 would come in, ifnot more

The live feed of the event was watched by over two million with over 400,000 of that using Namal Rajapaksas Facebook page to do that. That is a massive reach. 
It was clear that there was a strategic social media campaign that reached its crescendo as the protests were to hit the roads of Colombo  the target was that over 200,000 would come in, if not more. Nervous that they would get caught up in the protests office workers scrambled out Colombo. The stage was set. 
But when the protests got going, the contrast from the coordinated, well-groomed social media campaign was stark. There was confusion where the marches were to converge, what they would do thereafter and even where some of the top draws of the opposition were. There was no oomph moment where weeks of Facebook posts, tweets, meetings, posters and stickers would combine with the personalities on the roads set off the fireworks literally and figuratively. 
Since the protests many commentators have written about why they failed to live up to the hype. One aspect that has not been dealt with thoroughly is why the protestors on the streets did not match the swell on social media. 
One protestor wryly said that those who protest, at least who take part in mass political protests in Sri Lanka are not keen social media followers. They are still gathered one protestor at a time and brought to the rallies by organisers, similar to how it was done when there were only landline phones. Sri Lanka is not yet there where a protest can be organized by online campaigns. 

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has been a past master of public mobilization and his heir apparent was going to show that he was that andmuch more 

Experiences all over the world have shown that on social media, trends can be amplified or suppressed artificially. Here in Sri Lanka also this March there were indications on Twitter that bots purportedly of Sri Lankan origin were being created. 
However, there were no signs that the Janabalaya Kolombata campaign had been artificially propped up. The social media campaign was organized and well-coordinated except on one crucial point, in hindsight there was a glaring disconnect between the social media campaign and getting the men and women on to Colombos sweltering heat.

Milk packets: Govt. should take responsibility: JO
	
The Joint Opposition (JO) today said the government should take the responsibility and resign over the incident where milk packets containing poisonous substance were distributed among the protesters of the 'Janabalaya Kolombata' held last Wednesday.
JO MP Dullas Alahapperuma told a news conference that the same government which came into power guaranteeing people to provide toxin-free food had mixed a poisonous substance to the milk packets that were distributed during the protest.
We cannot point out our fingers at a specific MP or any other person. The government should be held responsible over this incident. This is not a political matter but solely a humanitarian matter. Accordingly, the government has no option but to resign he said.
He said the Police had not taken any reasonable measure to arrest the persons who were involved in this incident even though they had provided the police with the vehicle numbers which distributed these milk packets containing poisonous substance. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Mobitel, the National Mobile Service Provider was selected by the South Asia Gateway Terminals (Pvt) Ltd (SAGT), a leading container terminal operator in Sri Lanka, as its trusted provider of mission critical communications. This collaboration is even more significant for Mobitel, because this is the first-ever mission critical secure communication network implemented in Sri Lanka, with Mobitel being the sole technical partner for SAGT. After designing and implementing the system, it is currently managing the network on behalf of SAGT.
As part of this exciting partnership, Mobitel has delivered a communication system based on the ubiquitous LTE technology, which it customised for SAGTs mission critical communications within the shipping port. In doing so, Mobitel ensured SAGT benefitted from the advantages of deploying the world-renowned 3GPP standardised LTE technology. Some of the benefits accrued to SAGT as a result are mass market device availability at significantly lower costs, utilisation of licensed spectrum ensuring the network is safeguarded from radio frequency interference, proven network security and secure communications, and alignment with Mobitels 25-year experience in operations.
Mobitel has firmly positioned itself as an Innovator and as the National Mobile Service Provider, it is driving Sri Lankas ICT transformation. Mobitels march on its strategic path is ever more apparent in the solution it has deployed for SAGT. Ensuring mission critical services over LTE required Mobitel to specifically optimise service reliability within the geographic boundaries of the port, while increasing bandwidth and redesigning the network for reduced latency, a key parameter for mission critical services.
As the National Mobile Service Provider, the company has put its We Care. Always. promise into operation by institutionalizing the same in its strategic organizational framework. The innovative customisation of Mobitels globally acclaimed LTE network has resulted in improved productivity of the port operations owing to Mobitels unparalleled service reliability.
This solution was customized for SAGT by Mobitel Business Solutions (MBS), which is a dedicated division of Mobitel formulated to cater the corporate clients with unique ICT solutions embraced with mobile technologies to realize their fullest business potential.

My brother is certainly a contender: MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who is in India has said his brother is certainly a contender for presidential poll in 2019 but the SLPP and the coalition will have to decide who the people want.
In an interview with the Hindu, Mr. Rajapaksa said his son Namal Rajapaksa cant be a presidential candidate since the government has now raised the minimum age to 35 years instead of 30.
So Namal cant be considered in 2019. My brother is certainly a contender, but the party and the coalition will have to decide who the people want, he said upon asking whether the next presidential candidate of SLPP will be a member of the Rajapaksa family or someone outside of it.
When asked who would lead the SLPP into elections in 2019, Mr.Rajapaksa said he would lead the party.
There is a view that despite the Amendment I can fight elections and then fight it out in court. But I still have to decide whether to take that risk. Another option is to announce a candidate acceptable to all, he said.
When asked about his opinion on whether the LTTE cadres who were convicted for Rajiv Gandhis assassination should be released, he said he has no view on the matter.
It is up to the Indian government, it is an internal matter for India. If this was in Sri Lanka we would have taken a different line. But how can I say anything when the issue is in India, he said.
Meanwhile, he said India and his political camp had a lot of misunderstandings just before and after the elections in 2015.
Now of course, I think it is about time to move on. However, no one should meddle with somebody elses elections. It is an internal matter of a country whom the people decide to bring to power. I think now they all have understood what went wrong at that time and what they did. So we need to forget about the past. This is the time to move forward and look forward, he said.
Commenting on the allegations that he had accepted campaign funds from Chinese companies, Mr. Rajapaksa said China did not fund him.
This is what people talk about because this government has nothing else to accuse us of. When they came to power, they were looking for my $18 billion, but they are still looking for it (laughs) despite the help of the US and other countries. They havent even found a dollar, he said.
He also said Sri Lanka could have settled the loans his government obtained but the Sirisena government has messed things up.
For the Colombo Port City, we didnt have to pay anything, it was a contract sharing arrangement, where they got a share of the land they developed. At the time of the Hambantota port deal, our debt from China was less than our debt from the US and other countries and debt-to-GDP ratio was under control. So if the problem has grown now, and the government has not managed it, then how can you blame us, he said.

Party maverick meets his Waterloo!
	

There is a JO stalwart who made newspaper headlines by claiming that he was qualified to vie for any high office in the country given his merit and seniority as a politico.

He also started directing barbs at the former security bigwig who is rumoured as a likely candidate from Pohottuwa at the upcoming big poll.
However, the former strongman continued to keep his cool about the JO stalwarts outrageous public statements.
However, the former strongman had decided enough was enough on hearing that the JO man had said that he was not prepared to go marketing for anyone (kaatawath kade yanna laasthi nehe) which seemed an innuendo aimed at the JO leader himself.
Meanwhile, the former strongman met face to face the big-mouthed party stalwart at a wedding. And the former strongman exploded.
I didnt ask you to do any marketing for me (Mata kade yanna kiyala mama oheta kiyala nehe). You seem to be carrying out a contract for someone. What you keep saying in public is backfiring on all of us! I am going to decide on a candidate acceptable to all at the proper time. If you are not prepared to back the candidate I nominate, you may at least keep your big mouth shut!
A highly disconcerted JO maverick spluttered: Excuse me, Sir. I cant remember having said a thing like that!
The boss laughed at this answer.
Ah! You cant remember having said a thing like that. If you cant remember it doesnt matter! Try and remember at least what I have just told you!

52 pilgrims killed in India bus accident
	

Hindustan Times, Hyderabad, Sep 11, 2018
Fifty-two people were killed and several were injured after a state-owned Road Transport Corporation bus carrying pilgrims from a temple in the hills of Telanganas Jagtiyal district plunged off a road into a 30-foot gorge on Tuesday morning.
According to police, the pilgrims were on their way back from a Hanuman temple atop Kondagattu hill. The bus was travelling from Sanivarampet village to Jagitial via Kondagattu pilgrim centre when the accident took place around 11:30am.
Police suspect failure of brakes led to the accident. The driver, who also died in the accident, reportedly lost control as he tried to avoid another bus on the route. Most of the deaths seem to have occurred due to suffocation, as the passengers fell over one another, police said.
Authorities recovered bodies of five children, 32 females and 15 males before calling off the rescue operation. The injured were shifted to Jagitial government hospital. The toll could go up as the condition of some of the injured were stated to be critical.

Proposal to storm Diyawanna shot down!
	

There was a secret powwow chaired by the former strongman convened to finalize the plan for the September 5 Janabalaya protest. Only the JO front-liners attended this meeting.

They held a lengthy discussion on the cultural highlights and the entertainment items which should feature the demonstration to make it an unprecedentedly colourful and interesting event.
The participants who had handled the various aspects of the big event confirmed the readiness of all entertainment items like Virudu, Baila and songs and cultural highlights like Yaga and Thovil dancing, Daha-ata Paliya from the South, Angam-pora from Kalutara and Kirikoraha ritual dance from Mahiyangana.
The participants were exulting over the success of the arrangements when a JO big gun from the South proposed a new dimension to the protest event. Let us lay siege to the Diyawanna to demonstrate our strength!
A well-tempered politico, the former strongman did not take kindly to this proposal. However, the heavyweight from the South insisted that it was a good chance to show their strength, which they should not let slip through their fingers.
However, the former strongman with a derisive smile addressed the big gun from the South.
Why on earth should we surround the Diyawanna Of course, we can sit on the banks of Diyawanna and keep sneering at the water spread! But what purpose will it serve Why should we bother about such a stupid exercise Let us, instead, concentrate on making our protest in the city a great success!
The discussion ended with this reply by their boss.

Seventeen years after 9/11, civilization is a triumph - EDITORIAL
	
Perhaps hopelessness is the very soil that nourishes human hope; perhaps one could never find sense in life without first experiencing its absurdity
- Vaclav Havel 

When the LTTE choppers started hovering over the Colombo night skies on April 26, 2007 when the nation was busy watching the Cricket World Cup finals, the Sri Lankans got its closest experience to September 11, 2001. We lost the match and also the hope of war victory. The worlds most sophisticated terrorist outfit was calling shots here as never before. Al Qaeda carried out attacks with hijacked planes, the LTTE had its own air wing. Just like it happened after the Al-Qaeda attacks on Twin towers in Manhattan and the Pentagon, stunned and petrified masses here started predicting doomsday scenarios. Fear and hopelessness ruled for daysand weeks. 
Seven years after the LTTE air raid in Colombo the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant declared a new Islamic State dehumanizing civilization and gripping the whole world with terror. 
However by the time the world observed the seventeenth anniversary of 9/11 Al Qaeda is emasculated, the ISIS cornered and the LTTEannihilated militarily. 
Its quite interesting to note the way hope emerges from the depth of despair. Despair more often than not makes heroes out of zeroes and gifts better brain and brawn to the courageous. The secret is movement and mobility in the face of morbid fear. The spate of air attacks carried out by the air force here in aftermath of the suicide attack on the then Army Commander Sarath Fonseka is an example. The trick is to make use of the opportunity to launch a counter attack that it would not have made otherwise. Its these counter movements that made the difference and ended the wars that had lost hope in negotiations. 
While the triumph over terrorist outfits is a victory for the human race, the tragedy has been that more often than not these terrorist groups are created and nurtured by legitimate governments which finally fell victim to the very outfits they created. This patronage that often comes in the form of weapons breaks the thin line between a rights movement and a terrorist organization. The LTTE which was formed by a group of disgruntled Tamil youth over perceived injustice to their community turned in to a terrorist outfit with Indias decision to train and arm them. Al Qaeda is deemed to have born out of CIAs Operation Cyclone to weaken Russia and many attribute even the creation of ISIS to the United States.
It is likely that the countries that made the monumental political blunders of controlling other nations through proxy have learnt their lessons by now. India lost Rajiv Gandhi and the United States lost thousands of civilian and military lives to its own creations. While the ability to contain terrorism to the present extent is indeed a success for human race theres absolutely no guarantee that the status quo will remain unless the governments that play with fire learnt their lessons.

She lost her face again!
	

Kala Madam from the North who got into hot water by publicly yearning for the return of the Tigers had to face yet another predicament the other day, they say.

This happened at a public meeting held to mark the opening of a new law court in Kilinochchi.
Kala Madam well ahead of the function which was to be attended by a dozen of distinguished guests including the top team member for justice and the chief of the apex judiciary, had asked the organizers to reserve a seat for her in the front row itself and to include a special talk by her as an important item in the agenda of the function.
However, the organizers had told Kala Madam who is incidentally involved in a legal issue as well, that there was no possibility for accommodating her in the front row. Undeterred she had made the request to the top team member for justice, but the latters request to the organizers on behalf of Kala Madam had too failed to get a positive response.
So, Kala Madam had to sulk in a back seat on the stage throughout the proceedings, they say.

Sri Lanka is not falling into a Chinese debt trap: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is in Vietnam, has said he didn't believe that Sri Lanka was falling into a debt trap caused by high-interest Chinese loans.
On the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on ASEAN in Hanoi on Tuesday, Mr. Wickremesinghe has told the CNBC that,We are dealing with China. There are a fair amount of Chinese investments. There are China loansI can't see it as a threat,
The Premier has also denied the often cited claim that Sri Lanka was ceding control of strategically vital ports to Chinese control.
He has said the government inherited debt racked up through the mismanagement of the prior administration.
"We took over the government and stabilized the economy ... they ran away, we were the only ones left," he said.
Meanwhile, he said Sri Lanka is not under "threat" from growing China-US trade tensions, despite Sri Lankas reliance on Chinese investment.
Despite concerns voiced earlier this month by ratings agency Fitch about a "challenging" external debt servicing outlook and political uncertainty following regional polls, Mr. Wickremesinghe has said he didn't believe Sri Lankan sovereign bonds were on the verge of a downgrade.
"We and many others are running deficits in Asia and that certainly would be a matter of concern, but so far we have been able to negotiate with the rating agencies and it has certainly not affected our borrowing capacity," he said.
Japanese bank Nomura Holdings on Monday identified Sri Lanka as one of 30 emerging markets most susceptible to an exchange rate crisis, a claim vehemently denied by Sri Lanka's central bank and Mr.Wickremesinghe, who called it "false."
Sri Lanka, bailed out by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2009 and mid-2016, should not need further support from the global lender, the prime minister said. 
"We have been going to the IMF a bit too often ... Sri Lanka and Pakistan, and I hope that we will be able to manage. The IMF saved us at a crucial period, I must acknowledge it, but we must learn now to go on our own," he said.
Meanwhile, Mr.Wickremesinghe has said he "can't see an early election."
Sri Lanka not under 'threat' from US-China trade tensions, says PM from CNBC.

SriLankan stops serving cashews after Presidential fit
	
SriLankan Airline has said that it had stopped serving cashews after President Maithripala Sirisena flew into a rage over cashew nuts served to him on a flight to Colombo, the AFP reported on Wednesday.
An Airline spokesman said it has responded by clearing its stock of cashews which are only served in business class and would change its Dubai-based supplier.
Speaking at a farmers event held in Hambantota on Monday, President Sirisena said, "Returning from Kathmandu, I was served some cashews on board a SriLankan flight, but it was so bad even a dog wouldn't eat it. I want to know who authorised the purchase of these nuts."
The AFP said this is not the first time that nuts served on an airline had prompted outrage.
In 2014, a South Korean heiress famously ordered a Korean Air plane back to its gate to eject a cabin crew member after she was served nuts still in their packet.

Thiyunu Asipathaka Sevana Yata Memories of lessons learned in a conflict
	

Nine years after the bloody war against the Tiger rebels we still hear of violence taking place in some form in the north. Despite the rebels being completely wiped out and guns and bombs falling silent there is news from the north of sporadic attacks taking place using swords. At a time when hard earned peace is not valued it seems apt to review the book titled Thiyunu Asipathaka Sevana Yata-(Under the refuge of a deadly weapon)- the life story of ex-tiger rebel Thamilini Jeyakkumaran. 
In the book Thamilinis story is penned by Swaminathan Wimal following a request made to the former by Dharmasiri Bandaranayake to rekindle the past she had with the LTTE. In the book Thamilini talks about the glories associated with the LTTE and how the dream of building a separate nation was shattered, largely due to the wrong decisions made by the rebel hierarchy. The ex-tiger rebel was battling cancer at the time she fed the author of the book with the information about the war and finally succumbed to the disease. 
As one reads the 260-page book its evident that the LTTE never valued peace and even disliked the idea of promoting unity among communities. The organisations only vision was to build a separate nation and for that cause it laid down certain rules and regulations which the tiger rebels and the civilians had to adhere to even if they disliked them. Questioning the LTTE hierarchy and probing to find more information than what was provided was considered a crime within the organisation. 
Thamilini, like other desperate Tamil women in the north, joined the organisation when order within the civil society was sent into oblivion due to the constant fighting between the Sri Lanka Army and the LTTE. 

According to Tamilini the role of the women in the Tamil society had changed immensely with females joining the rebel movement

Her only ambition was to excel in studies and enter the university, but a cruel war put her on a path to disruption. Between 29th July in 1991 and 16th May in 2009 she saw the world through the eyes of a terrorist. The book tells us that she was largely used by the organisation for political propaganda work; given her oratory skills. 
She rose swiftly within the ranks of the organsation and became the head of the womens political wing. However she recalls instances during which she realised certain flaws in the LTTEs decision making like imposing taxes on people and the forced recruitment of civilians to the organisation during the latter stages of the war. She says she was depressed when trying to find the answers to the question as to why a rebel organisation, fighting for the liberties of the Tamil people, had decided to use the same citizens as human shields when battling against the Government troops in Jaffna. 

Change of womens role
According to Tamilini the role of the women in the Tamil society had changed immensely with females joining the rebel movement. The otherwise restricted role of women being housewives changed to one of importance with the gun-slinging women making their contribution towards building a separate homeland for theTamil people. 
Whether the rest of Sri Lanka likes it or not Tiger rebel Leader Velupillai Prabakaran had an immense presence and a commanding personality and was considered as a demi god, according to Thamilinis description of her leader in the book. 
Even when the war intensified in the Wanni in 1999 and the Army was advancing, Thamilini stated that those within the organisation believed that Prabakaran had a solution for the problems that existed. 
The book intricately describes the turning point in the whole conflict which was the closing of the Mavil Aru Reservoir by the LTTE in 2006. This move had adversely effected the Sinhalese farmers in the area. The Army then acquiring Mavil Aru pretty soon that year had dented the confidence of the rebels. The Government again closing the A 9 road and the war intensifying in 1999 had pushed the Tamil civilians from pillar to post. 
According to Thamilinis description of the finals stages of the war she had managed to keep a sound mind which she says was helpful in taking some vital decisions.

This decision she says, pertaining to her, was taken after realising that the Tiger hierarchy had abandoned the remaining members of the organsation

Leaving the organisation
As the Army closed in on the Tigers she had valiantly tried to keep in contact with LTTEs Political leader Nadesan, but her efforts proved futile. It was then that she had given the order to the other cadres under her command to leave the organisation which she herself did eventually. This decision she says, pertaining to her, was taken after realising that the Tiger hierarchy had abandoned the remaining members of the organsation. These gripping chapters of the book give a glimpse into the mind of a honest lady who was true to her conscience. 
The skills of the writer Wimal are best showcased in these chapters where the fall of a world renowned terrorist organisation is described intelling fashion. 
The chapters in which Thamilini surrenders to the Army and spends her jail term underscores the fact that she was willing to undergo punishment for her wrongdoings. But the most important thing about the experience in jail is that she comes out keeping her head straight and wanting to see a new beginning to her life. 
The rehab process she talks about in the book suggests that the Government of Sri Lanka had a solid plan to reform these ex-tiger rebels and make them fit into society again. Thamilini says in the book that she was surprised to see that people who were in charge of the rehab programme were not hostile to her. 

In the book Thamilinis story is penned by Swaminathan Wimal following a request made to the former by Dharmasiri Bandaranayake to rekindle the past she had with the LTTE

Finishing the rehab programme she finds her future partner in life, Jeyakumaran. But destiny is not kind to her even during this stage of her life because she is diagnosed with cancer. Death swiftly takes her life despite receiving the best of treatment at the Maharagama Cancer Hospital. While helping pen her life story, Thamilanis request was to donate the proceeds of this book to the cancer hospital where she received treatment.

Trump receives Kim Jong Un letter seeking 2nd meet
	

WASHINGTON AFP Sept11, 2018
US President Donald Trump has received a very positive letter from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un seeking a follow-up meeting after their historic summit in Singapore, the White House said.
It was a very warm, very positive letter, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, adding that the message showed Pyongyangs continued commitment to focus on denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.
The primary purpose of the letter was to schedule another meeting with the president, which we are open to and are already in the process of coordinating, she said Monday at the first White House press briefing in nearly three weeks.
Sanders added that the letter was further evidence of progress in Washingtons relationship with Pyongyang.
Trump and Kim held a historic summit in Singapore in June that raised prospects of a breakthrough on curtailing North Koreas nuclear programme.
South Koreas dovish President Moon Jae-in, who brokered the June meeting, vowed to continue playing the role of a mediator to facilitate dialogue between Trump and Kim.

UK urges Sri Lanka to fast-track UN resolutions
	
In a statement to the UNHRC, on behalf of the Sri Lanka Core Group, the United Kingdom urged Sri Lanka to prioritise and drive forward implementation of the UNHRC Resolutions 30/1 and 34/1, before the Council next considers Sri Lanka in March, next year.
The Sri Lanka Core Group comprises Germany, Macedonia, Montenegro and the UK.
Our view remains that, with determined leadership and a clear time-bound action plan, this Government can make more progress towards delivering its Council commitments, and that doing so will better position Sri Lanka and its people to enjoy a more enduring reconciliation and prosperity, the UK said.
We welcome further recent steps Sri Lanka has taken to implement commitments made to the Council in 2015 and 2017. We welcome the Governments continued engagement with the UN system and actions to implement its National Reconciliation Action Plan and Peacebuilding Priority Plan.
We applaud the Office on Missing Persons commencement of work and encourage everyone able to advance or contribute to its work to do so. We hope the Government will establish an Office for Reparations quickly. We also welcome the return of further private land in the north, and commitments to return the more military-occupied land to civilian ownership.
Nonetheless, the pace of progress on important areas remains much slower than many hoped for. As time passes, lack of progress in delivering key steps risks undermining reconciliation efforts.
In co-sponsoring resolution 30/1, Sri Lanka recognised that national accountability mechanisms are essential to dealing with the past, and to restoring confidence among its communities. These have yet to be established. The Prevention of Terrorism Act has not been replaced with a law that accords with international standards. And, though processes to consider reform to important provisions of the Constitution, including devolution of political authority, has been ongoing since 2016, a way forward has not been found. We are concerned by recent reports of harassment of and attacks on human rights defenders.

## Section: Hard talk

We will fight for an SLFP Govt. with  MR as PM  - Dilan -
	

MR TO GIVE A FORCEFUL FIGHT TO THE UNP AT THE THREE POLLS
	
	NEW SLFP GOVT UNDER MR WILL BE A NEW BOTTLE WITH NEW WINE AND NEW TASTE
	
	MR IS THE MOST MARKETABLE POLITICIAN IN THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW
	
	I WILL BE THE FIRST TO WISH DUMINDA IF HE COMES OUT OF YAHAPALANA GOVT.
	
	I MUST REMIND YOU THAT THEY MET THEIR MAIN OBJECTIVE OF MAKING COLOMBO STANDSTILL


The Daily Mirror spoke to SLFP rebel group front liner and former Minister Dilan Perera on politics, forthcoming PC, Presidential and Parliamentary polls and groups preparation for the challenges etc. He sharedthe following:

Q How about your groups preparation for the forthcoming Provincial Council polls
Our group of 15 MPs minus one from the original 16, who quit the Yahapalana Government on April 11, are now working hard to ensure the victory of the joint opposition at the forthcoming PC, Presidential and Parliamentary polls. None of us have obtained the SLPP membership but remain as a separate SLFP group of the JO. Many other SLFP members who crossed over to the JO from the government before us are not members of Pohottuwa either.
Question of joining Pohottuwa is not vital under the prevailing political situation and answer to your question on our preparation for the three polls is simple. From day one since we joined the JO we have worked hard to bring all anti UNP forces under one roof and only that strategy would bring an absolute victory for the JO, not only at the PC polls but at the Presidential and Parliamentary polls that would follow. In short, all progressive, anti capitalist and anti imperialist forces that would stand against the UNP must be formed as a formidable front under ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa to give a forceful fight to the UNP at the three polls. 

Filing charges against a person in a court of law and finding him guilty are two different matters. But I can assure you that the SLFP or the SLPP would not give nominations to any of the members if convicted in a court of law for any offense

QA number of pohottuwa (SLPP) and SLFP members have been charged in various courts on allegations of corruption, murder, embezzlement and several other crimes. At this backdrop, are you still going to form the next government with them
Filing charges against a person in a court of law and finding him guilty are two different matters. But I can assure you that the SLFP or the SLPP would not give nominations to any of the members if convicted in a court of law for any offence. I would like to draw your attention to the presumption that one is considered innocent until proven guilty well known in the legal parlance. Besides, you must not forget that a majority of cases filed against members of the JO and some officials served under the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime are politically motivated.
However, I agree that there were mistakes and blunders committed by the previous government. We would definitely rectify those omissions and commissions in a government formed under MR after the next Parliamentary polls and give real meaning to the concept of good governance. I also would like to tell you that a new SLFP government under MR will be a new bottle with new wine and new taste. Not old wine in a new bottle because we have learnt much from our past mistakes.


However, I agree that there were mistakes and blunders committed by the previous government. We would definitely rectify those omissions and commissions in a government formed under Mahinda after the next Parliamentary polls and give real meaning to the concept of good governance


QBut Shakespeare has famously said Caesars wife (must not only be above any allegations but) must be above suspicion in Julius Caesar. Dont you think this applies to public figures and politicians on the whole
As I told you earlier, many of the court cases against SLFP or SLPP members are the work of the UNP who is on power. Almost all the cases are selective and individual targeted. They have not been charged on bona-fide intentions but on political victimization.
What action the government has taken to bring the biggest fraudster in history and first accused in the Central Bank bond scam, Arjuna Mahendran even after the Interpol issued a red warrant on him How many times the Prime Minister has said in Parliament that he would take the responsibility to bring him back You can check the Handsard for this. At the same time I admit that we have bad eggs among us and I never say that all our members are clean and lily-white. 

QThe PC polls expected in early 2019, Presidential and Parliamentary polls that would follow, will be a bitter fight between the three main political parties, the UNP, SLFP and the SLPP. What are the plans in store to win these elections
Answer is simple. I dont think the JO or the SLPP will have a fight at hand at all in the three elections. But the UNP under Ranil will have a bitter fight with us, no doubt. I am confident that the SLFP will not contest separately. If the SLFP did not join the JO and contested separately, it will also be a bitter fight for it. Most probably, that will also be the end of SLFP.
What is the current thinking of voters today At the February local government polls, the SLPP which is as a young as a baby drew 49,41,952 votes out of a total valid votes of 123,72,816 recording 44.65%. The UNP in a distanced second got 36,12,259 at 32.63% while the UPFA got 491,835 votes at 8.44% of the total valid votes while the SLFP was able to woo only a poor and miserable 949,821 votes at 4.44% of total valid votes. When you go through these numbers the results in future polls are very clear. What would be the scenario if and when the SLFP or the UPFA contests separately and what would be the situation if both parties joined the JO. The SLPP supported by the JO needs only another 6% to record an absolute majority in Presidential and Parliamentary elections and we can reach that target even without the SLFP or the UPFA with the support of minority parties. Another important factor is that the socio-economic and political tide has swept much in favour of the SLPP and against the government since February.
However, if there is going to be a joint front comprising the JO-led SLPP, SLFP and UPFA against the UNP, the victory to our camp would be a Grand Slam. This is a reality and not a possibility and I believe and pray that the SLFP hierarchy would give a deep thought to this. Otherwise, their political future is doomed.



A new SLFP government under Mahinda will be a new bottle with new wine and new taste. Not old wine in a new bottle because we have learnt much from our past mistakes




QIs any rapprochement possible between the UNP and SLFP after the PC polls to set up administrations in local government bodies as it is extremely doubtful that a single party would be able to secure a majority in many of the provincial councils...
We dont mind, President Maithripala Sirisena remains as the President further but not backed by the UNP. We dont expect from President Sirisena to put the signal to the left and turn to the right as happened in the last three years. The only way out for us from this political imbroglio is to form a formidable and strong political front led and blessed by MR with all progressive forces and like minded minority parties that include the MEP led by Dinesh Gunawardana, NFF led by Wimal Weerawansa, DLF led by Vasudeva Nanayakkara, PHU led by Udaya Gammanpila and all Muslim and Tamil parties led by Rauff Hakeem,Arumugan Thondaman, Rishad Bathiudeen, Mano Ganeshan,Palany Digambaram,Douglas Devananda and many others. The only exception is Prof. G.L.Peiris who is not an SLFP member. 
QThe split among many factions within the SLFP and the SLPP has come to a peak now. This will affect badly on the party at future polls, no doubt. How are you going to tackle this major issue
Yes, my simple answer to this is whoever is to become President or what ever party or front to form the government in future, the blessings and support of MR is extremely vital and decisive. There will be no president or a government without his support and blessings. In the circumstances, it is up to the SLFP and the UPFA and minority parties to decide with whom they join at the forthcoming polls. It is not a problem for the JO or the SLPP. 

QSoon after the success of the SLPP at the Local Government polls, the undisputed candidate of the JO or the SLPP was Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. The situation is much different now as names of Dinesh, Kumara, Chamal and even of Kumara have been mentioned by various dissenting members of the JO. So, who will be the JO candidate
My personal view is that Gota has himself got undermined his position as a possible Presidential candidate by taking the extremist line of people like Kamal Gunaratne and Sarath Weerasekara. If he expects the support of minority parties for his victory he must get distanced himself from former Military officers who are famous for their anti minority ideology. It Gotas responsibility to convince the masses that he is a candidate representing all communities that include Sinhala Buddhists, Tamils, Muslim, Upcountry Tamils, Malays and Burgers could vote for him. My view is that Chamal Rajapksa is the ideal candidate with the blessings and whole- hearted support of MR. If any candidate thinks he/she could achieve victory only with Sinhala Buddhist votes, it is a mistake. 
What ever said and done, I would like to see MR as the PM and someone out of the Rajapaksa family as the President. It will relieve us from many issues that may crop up in the local and international forums. Meanwhile, the JO will take a decision on its Presidential candidate when the elections are announced by the Elections Commission.

QWill there be Constitutional implications if and when MR becomes PM
I think the Supreme Court must give an interpretation to this as there is a possibility that MR could become Executive President for a third time (which will be a violation of the Constitution) if Presidency becomes vacant while he remains as the PM. The Constitution has not drawn its attention to this possibility and as such needs an interpretation. 
We want MR as PM and Maithripala as President to run a most democratic and people friendly administration after 2020.


I support a probe on NYT exposure on Mahinda if Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Finance and Media Minister Mangala Smaraweera publicly say that Trump was wrong when he castigated CNN and NYT as fake and therefore no one can take the US media as the cardinal truth


QThough you are a member of the SLFP and do politics under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena, you virtually stand with the former President during each and every national issue. How and why
I dont think MR will agree with me on power devolution. I have campaigned for 13+ and I will continue to do it in future too. Whether we like or not we must accept that Tamils have genuine grievances. I stand with him because he has given the leadership to the left leaning JO though he will not agree with my 13+ stand. I have remained in my entire political carrier as a politician with leftist ideals and policies. Besides, MR is the most marketable politician in the country right now.
Dont forget Ranil won the general election in 2002 when Chandrika Kumaratunga was the Executive President with full powers. Any future amalgamation between the SLFP and the SLPP must yield us a win-win situation between these two.

Q How do you see the exposure of the New York Times which alleged that the China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) had funded MRs Presidential Polls campaign in 2015
President Donald Trump is on records saying that the NYT is fake. So why should we quote a fake newspaper to prove a point
I support a probe on NYT allegations if PM Ranil Wickremesinghe and Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera publicly say that Trump is wrong when he accused CNN and NYT as fake, and therefore, no one can take the US media as cardinal truth. 

QThere are media reports that a new General Secretary would be chosen at the next UPFA General Meeting and a new SLFP General Secretary at the next SLFP convention in early September. Are these true
Yes, not only a new General Secretary to the SLFP but a new secretary to the UPFA would be elected shortly as Duminda Dissanayake and Mahinda Amaraweera take decisions from Sirikotha. We dont want them to wash dirty linen of the UNP and therefore, there will be two new General Secretaries for both parties. When Minister Mahinda Amaraweera talks I feel like his words are coming from Mangala Samaraweeras mouth. 


If he (Duminda) leaves the Yahapalana Government I would be the first person to accept him to the JO with both hands, give a big hug and a kiss to his both cheeks


QIt seems that the euphoria the SLPP and the JO generated among their supporters with the success of the local government polls has now been evaporated. Do you agree
No, I dont agree. On January 8, 2015, people voted en-mass in favour of President Sirisena and in August that year gave a majority of parliament seats to the UNP as their list of pledges were long and attractive. None of these pledges have been fulfilled in the past three years and the voters displayed their resentment in a big way at the local government polls in February this year.
I dont think mindset against the government and the UNP have changed. That is why we ask the government to hold PC polls as early as possible.

QWhat is this love  hate relationship between you and your erstwhile friend, Minister Duminda Dissanayaka
In fact, I love him and adore him. He has a future in Sri Lankas politics. He and I are buddies from our childhood and I have a great respect for his father, late Berty Premalal Dissanayaka whom I consider as one of my political gurus. His family or his residence in Anuradhapura is very familiar place to me. When we had a quarrel as children, Mr. Dissanayaka stood by me and advised both of us. He was an SLFP colossus in Rajarata and did much for the people of Rajarata while fighting with politicians like Adikari and Mahindasoma. So, serving in a UNP led coalition government is a wrong decision taken by Duminda.
I appeal to Duminda, treating him as my younger brother, please come out of the government, as it is not your place. You have a great future in the SLFP and dont get ruined your place in the party. If he leaves the Yahapalana Government I would be the first person to accept him to the JO with both hands, with a big hug and a kiss to his both cheeks. 

If there is going to be a joint front comprising the JO led SLPP, SLFP and UPFA against the UNP the victory to our camp would be a Grand Slam. This is a reality and not a possibility and I believe and pray that the SLFP hierarchy would give deep thought to this. Otherwise, their political future is doomed

I also admit that Mr. Dissanayaka was treated badly by the last regime and he died with a broken heart. He was not appointed as the Chief Minister after the PC polls in September 2012 as he came second in the voting list. But the MR government chose to appoint candidates who elected with second best votes in other provinces as the CM. This should not have happened in the first place because Mr. Dissanayaka had sacrificed his entire life for the SLFP. 

QFinally, the overall assessment among politicians of the divide, among the media and the public is that the Janabalaya Colombata protest on last Wednesday was not successful as the JOs protest held at the Galle Face Green on May Day, 2017. Your comments
Only the media and the UNP say that the Janabalaya Colombata was a flop. Basil Rajapaksa, who organized the May Day Rally of the SLPP in 2017 at the Galle Face Green is a man of action.
What happened on last Wednesday (5), was that the protesters did not converge at a specified place like Galle Face as they came from all parts of the country through five different highways to Colombo.
Therefore, their gathering in Colombo did not make a big impact as they were spread all over Colombo. I must remind you that they met their main objective of making Colombo standstill.

A hit below the belt
	

There was a ceremony to mark the inauguration of a housing scheme in the gem-city district recently. The Green bigwig on a mission of providing housing to the poor without a proper shelter was also present on the occasion.

The Green big gun holding deputy status in the party was earlier welcomed by the Green Madam ruling the roost in the district. The young Green Diyawanna member from the district who is embroiled in a protracted feud with the Green Madam too was present.
During the proceedings of the public rally that followed the main ceremony, the Green Madam seated next to the Green big gun was seen in intimate conversation with him, occasionally breaking into laughter as if they were sharing a joke or enjoying a wisecrack.
And then the turn for the Green deputy to address the gathering came.
The Green deputy who began his address amidst loud applause pointed a finger at the young Green Diyawanna member seated on the stage and declared:
Heres a leader-in-waiting for you! He is quite capable of filling the void left by your onetime great leader, whom we lost at an unexpected hour a few years ago!
All eyes soon turned to the Green Madam, whose face had gone a shade darker.
The madam who looked quite grim and uneasy left the meeting a few minutes later proffering some excuse, they say.

A wedding that became the talk of the town!
	

Gossip stories relating to the recent wedding of a young gabby Diyawanna member, incidentally a VIPs son, are galore and they continue to entertain humour-crazy ones in political circles.

The premises of a VVIPs official residence being the venue of this wedding gave the event an extra measure of publicity.  
The young buddies of the Diyawanna member accounted for the majority of the thousands of guests, who attended the wedding, they say.
Most of these buddies had known of an item the young groom loved from his childhood days: high-quality jerseys. So, there had been many jerseys of varied hues among the heaps of his wedding presents.
In fact, this wedding had been the main subject at many powwows among the politicos at the national level. This subject had come up even at a discussion a very high political authority had with a select group of party organizers.
Well, it was a grand event, the political bigwig had remarked. However, this kind of thing never happened even during that ones (arayage) time!
He had not explained whom he referred to as araya. Those present needed no identifying either, they say.

At least 32 killed in suicide attack on Afghan protesters
	

JALALABAD AFP Sept11, 2018
A suicide attack on protesters in eastern Afghanistan on Tuesday killed at least 32 people, officials said, as an uptick in violence across the war-torn country dampens hopes for peace talks and elections.
There were chaotic scenes at several hospitals as medical staff struggled to treat 128 people wounded by the powerful blast in Nangarhar province.
Gul Majid was among scores of protesters blocking the highway between the provincial capital of Jalalabad and a major Pakistan border crossing when he heard a big bomb.
Then I saw flesh, blood and people wounded all around me, Majid told AFP outside one of the hospitals.
I am still looking for my friends. I dont know whether they are alive or dead. The men had been protesting over the appointment of a local police chief, provincial governor spokesman Ataullah Khogyani said.
Provincial health director Najibullah Kamawal and Khogyani both confirmed the latest casualty toll.
The attack came hours after a double bombing in front of a girls school in the provincial capital Jalalabad, which killed a boy and wounded four others.

Bridging gaps in sexual and reproductive  health and rights
	
Dr Alvaro Bermejo meeting with the community

The need to prevent unsafe and illegal abortions and unwanted pregnancies, the empowerment of youth and women in particular have become hot topics that have been debated and discussed on numerous platforms to date. The Family Planning Association of Sri Lanka recently hosted a media interactive session with the Director General of International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) Dr. Alvaro Bermejo to obtain a broader understanding on a number of subjects that revolves around family planning, challenges faced in empowering young women, tackling violence and harassment in day-to-today life, eliminating the threat of HIV, the issue with legalising abortion and on Governments plans on how these subjects would be approached in the future. 
Dr. Bermejo has over 20 years experience as a Senior Executive in global federations committed to working on HIV and AIDS, humanitarian issues and health policy. Moreover, the IPPF itself is an organisation that advocates sexual and reproductive health and rights for all. The IPPF works in close collaboration with the FPASL to address these issues by means of a rights based and gender - sensitive approach. 
Addressing the media, Dr. Bermejo said that he felt inspired by looking at countries that have done well in family planning, including HIV prevention. While commending the Family Planning Association of Sri Lanka for its outstanding service and its role in HIV prevention as a member country of the IPPF, Dr. Bermejo said that Sri Lanka has topped the list in its region as a result, noting in the meantime that Sri Lanka is also the first country in the Asian region, which he has visited. According to Dr. Bermejo, the country has indicated an overall success compared to others in the region in HIV prevention along with its gradual transition into becoming an upper middle income country. 

Discussions with the Government
In response to a query on what transpired between the discussions that were held with Government officials, Dr. Bermejo said that a meet-up was arranged with the Director of the National AIDS Control Programme on the challenges to reach the 90-90-90 target set internationally to be met by 2020, where ninety percent of AIDS patients living with HIV will be identified and of those identified, ninety percent would have access for treatment. The Programme will further ensure that of those who receive treatment, ninety percent would be immune so that they will not be transmitting the disease. Stating that Sri Lanka might fall short of meeting this target, he said that despite Sri Lanka facilitates good access to patients diagnosed with HIV by linking them to health care systems, the real challenge lies in its inability to reach out to those who may be diagnosed with HIV and provide them with the proper treatment. Also, many HIV patients diagnosed with the disease, are not inclined to meet a he
althcare provider and seek treatment. Stating that this is the gap that needs to be bridged, Dr. Bermejo stressed that the FPASL needs to reach out to key populations that are not reached in this regard. 
We are also discussing whether other technologies that are not being introduced to Sri Lanka could be helpful. For example technologies such as the HIV Self-testing would be helpful in diagnosing the disease. This is not yet available in Sri Lanka, and we were discussing what is necessary to make it available here. Steps have been taken to lower the price of this, because they are still commercially expensive, he added. 
We held discussions with the Director of Family Health Bureau about the challenges young woman who do not have access to services may have and on how we have a big cohort of young women who are about to reach reproductive age and become sexually active. We dont really know about their healthcare seeking behaviour. Will
these girls come to the clinic the way the older generation did Perhaps not. How will they express their sexuality 
Girls and boys tend to be adopters of new technologies, they have access to phones and the internet, which provides them with new possibilities, both good and bad ones. These girls will tend in the future to self-diagnose and self-medicate; thats the reality in many countries. Adolescents are the first ones who dont want to go to the clinic and talk about having had sex and needing to test. If they can find tests available on the Internet either they have the disposable income or manage to convince someone to buy that for them on the Internet. Following a test, if they can access for example emergency contraception on the internet, thats what they will do or they will access something else. So we need to see how we adjust our services to this new reality thats already there Dr. Bermejo said. 
Currently Sri Lanka has a two-and-half-decade successful family programme and a fertility rate hovering around 2.10- 2.5%. However, according to the doctor, it is important to ensure that the rate doesnt fall much below as it may lead to problems such as an ageing population. Moreover, plans are underway to establish services in the free trade zones since these are places where young girls with disposable income are going into; where girls aged between 16 - 18 are often recruited. 

Should abortion be legalized
Acknowledging that abortions happen everywhere, Dr. Bermejo said that mothers are often compelled to make a tough decision when confronted with very difficult situations regardless of whether it is legal or illegal. That has been the experience everywhere, but we have noticed recently that there is a clear trend observed in countries that have legalised abortion, where the numbers of abortions are coming down faster than in the countries that have not legalised it. So I think that is also an answer to those who say, if we legalise abortion there will be more abortions. That has not only proven true, but also now there is emerging evidence to indicate that in countries that have legalised abortion, the number of abortions are dropping at a rapid pace. Our view as an organisation that fights for sexual and reproductive health and rights of women is that abortion should be legalised both for the sake of the mother and her rights to control her own body. 
It is not an easy debate. However, I think that it is best discussed by Sri Lankans who know this reality and it was also confirmed to me that this debate is happening at
the highest level with the President. I think that it is to be welcomed. I hope that there can be a healthy debate; one that is reasonable that doesnt go into myths. This is about the healthcare of women and to lower the level of maternal mortality that Sri Lanka has. It is also clear that those that are dying are a group of women involved in unsafe abortions. There is a big percentage of mothers who are dying though this is totally preventable. Safe and legal abortion is a much lower risk than pregnancy. So they need not to die, Dr. Bermejo said. 

The Programme will further ensure that of those who receive treatment, ninety percent would be immune so that they will not be transmitting the disease

Tackling gender based violence and sexual abuse
Responding to a question on how the IPPF tackles and voices out against sexual abuse and gender based violence, Dr. Bermejo said that the organisation has a number of programmes under its wing committed to address this issue. Initiatives are in place to ensure that the healthcare sector would take a better approach in identifying such victims, help and treat them. 
Awareness has to start from adolescents when masculinity is defined, when gender norms are integrated in one. Thats why I am convinced that we need sexuality education at a younger age and be able to address the issues which are not so much about sex, but about relationships, gender, masculinity and on how we relate to each other. That needs to starts much earlier. And it needs to have a strong curricula. Thats where IPPF is outing its effort and again its a bit similar to abortion; its one of those issues that is controversial these days. How we should approach the subject in a way that is appropriate to the age is quite a problem. And I think we need to have more debate and debate in that sense is healthy. But Im equally convinced that keeping young people in the dark and ignorance in the current environment is the worst possible thing we could do he added. 

Long-term goals of the IPPF
The long-term goals of the IPPF are focused on creating a world where governments of respective countries will be engaged in promoting and respecting reproductive rights. The IPPF aims to create an environment where young people will have the opportunity to grow in a safe and secure place without being vulnerable targets of sexual harassment. It will also help to build a safe environment, which connects everyone to services while continuing to build the capacity of countries including the FPASL. These are the four major objectives outlined in IPPFs strategic framework to be achieved by 2022. 
For sure, co-operation and knowledge-sharing are crucial. Our greatest comparative advantage is that we are a federation of national organisations, but in order for them to benefit as being part of that federation, we really need to get much better at the way in which we support each other, share knowledge and technical development Dr. Bermejo added in his conclusive remarks.

Cabinet nod for Counter Terrorism Bill to replace PTA
	
The Cabinet endorsed yesterday the Counter-Terrorism Bill to be enacted by Parliament repealing the Prevention of Terrorism Act applied during the wartime in dealing with the activities of the LTTE.
However, Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe proposed amendments to be incorporated into the Bill during the committee stage of the debate later in Parliament.
In the present draft, only life imprisonment is stipulated for murder. Mr. Rajapakshe reportedly said capital punishment had been envisaged for murder under the Penal Code under normal circumstances, and therefore there could not be any exemption for the same crime to be covered under the new piece of legislation.
Also, the police have been cited as the implementing agency of the bill if enacted. However, Mr. Rajapakshe took up the position that the Defence Ministry should have the authority to implement the provisions of this bill as a piece of legislation dealing with national security.
Currently, the Prevention of Terrorism Act provides for taking court action based on confessions by terrorist suspects. However, such provision has been excluded from the new bill. An argument broke out between Mr. Rajapakshe and Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera over this.
Mr. Rajapakshe noted that the anti-terrorism law of the United Kingdom even contained provisions for court action based on confessions, and asked why Sri Lanka, as a country battered by terrorism, should deviate from it. Mr.Samaraweera, backed by Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana, argued otherwise.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka stood for Mr. Rajapakshe in presenting his case at the Cabinet. President Maithripala Sirisena also agreed to the amendments proposed by Mr. Rajapakshe.
Another amendment was proposed to include separatism as an offence.
Finally, the Cabinet cleared the bill on condition that the amendments proposed by Mr. Rajapakshe would be incorporated during the committee stage. (Kelum Bandara)
