An ambitious son of a prominent politician too had been among some politicos who took undue advantage of the disaster caused by floods to bag a measure of cheap popularity.

The young man had been distributing relief packs to flood victims transported by government vehicles draped with large banners boldly announcing a foundation named after him.
The flood aid that the son of the politician had distributed had come from relief donations the Ministry had received and he had restricted the distribution to the victims in the electoral division he is looking after.

He found a short-cut to tell it all
	

A purohita from the South was seen walking up and down the House during the sittings on a day last week in a state of great agitation.

He kept on telling the members in general: I didnt take him! I didnt take him! I know nothing about this appointment!
From the moment this purohita stepped into the House, his colleagues  had started asking him about a controversial appointment made to a high post in his Ministry. Tired of explaining matters to all inquisitive members individually, the purohita had walked back and forth announcing his position in regard to the issue for the benefit of all interested in it.

How he escaped unscathed
	

Sparks flew as expected during the much publicised Diyawanna council debate on an airline that had become a heavy burden on the exchequer.

A certain purohita who had had close ties to the institution operating this airline had made a great effort on the eve of this debate to avert criticisms expected to be directed at him.
This purohita had approached all opposition members listed to participate in the debate and had implored them not to drag his name in the mud during the debate. Meeting these members individually and addressing by intimate terms such as Malli, Aiya and Machang, he had told them: Please dont drag my name. You all ought to know that I had no hand in those deals.
The purohitas humble appeal was not in vain for none of the opposition members attacked him during the debate. They directed all their fire at the kith and kin of the former strongman.

I wasnt under the influence of liquor: Herath
	
While rejecting allegations that he was under the influence of liquor at the time of Mondays accident in Rajagiriya, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Vijitha Herath said today he admitted committing a traffic offence by not avoiding an accident and driving carelessly.
He said he condemned the attempts by certain people to take undue advantage of the incident by alleging that he was under the influence of liquor at the time of the accident.
Mr. Herath said the double cab driven by him had crashed into a telephone post when he swerved the vehicle to avoid a pedestrian crossing the road.
He said neither him nor the pedestrian suffered injuries except for the telephone post was damaged.
Certain websites and Facebook posts spreading false rumours alleged that I was drunk at the time of the accident. I reject these baseless allegations. I was produced before a doctor soon after the accident and the medical report proved that I was not drunk and even the police had confirmed that I was not drunk. I admit that I committed a traffic offence. But it is natural for anyone to commit such an offence while driving, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Laws soon to ban animal sacrifices
	
The Ministry of Rehabilitation, Resettlement, Prison Reforms and Hindu Religious Affairs is expected to submit a Cabinet paper next week seeking to introduce legislation banning all forms of animal sacrifices at Hindu temples.
The Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs Department has already drafted the legislation which has been endorsed by the Legal Draftsmans Department.
On earlier occasions several protests were held opposing animal sacrifice as part of religious rituals.
The Department said the practice of sacrificing animals at Hindu Temples in the in Northern Sri Lanka, especially in the Districts of Jaffna and Puttalam was continuing despite the protests by several organizations and well-known personalities raising their voices against such practices.
Animal sacrifices are usually carried out in village temples for local deities or clan deities like Amman, Bairavar, Muniyappar , Kaattha Virayar, Aiyappan, Veerapaththirar, Paththirakali Amman.
These deities are said to be guardian lords of villages and villagers have developed a tradition of sacrificing, cows, goats and cockerels to appease the wrath of the deities.
Villagers believe that sacrificing animals, called Bali means tribute offering or oblation and often practiced for no rhyme or reason. "Bali among other things refers to the blood oblation of an animal and is known as "Irattha Bali" among Jaffna villagers.
In Hindu precepts, there is no mention of these types of "Bali" or ritual sacrifices practiced in many temples, the Department said. (Kelum Bandara)

The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) today made it mandatory to include the terms and conditions in guarantee cards in all three languages for consumer durables with effect from January 01, 2017, CAA Chairman Hasitha Tillekeratne said.
He said this regulation was implemented under the Extraordinary Gazette Notice 1966/43.
The CAA made this decision considering the views of the public which constantly brings to the attention of several issues regarding consumer durables and this is largely due to the guarantee cards carrying terms and conditions only in English, he said.
After having drawn the attention of the Minister of Industry and Commerce, Rishard Bathiudeen to this matter, I was authorized to implement the regulation, he added. 
Mr. Tillekeratne said that this can be considered as yet another step towards strengthening the consumers right to information. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
