Amarapura Nikaya says adoption of Bill with amendments very beneficial
	
Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Nikaya said that the Buddha Sasana Karya Sadhaka Mandalaya that has the four Most Venerable Mahanayaka Theras as its Anusasakas, has discussed the proposed Act for the Registration of 'Katikavat of Theravada Bhikkhu Nikayas', in minute detail and a set of important recommendations have been submitted.
It is the considered view of the Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Sangha Sabha that the adoption by Parliament of the Bill after incorporating the suggested amendments will be very beneficial to both the Buddha Sasana and the Bikkhu Sangha, Supreme Patriarch of the Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Nikaya, Most Venerable Dauldena anissara Thera said yesterday.
Full statement
To protect and perpetuate the Buddha Sasana is the paramount duty of both the Maha Sangha and the laity. In keeping with the traditions championed by the rulers of Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka Government is bound by its constitution to protect and foster Buddhism.
It is clear that the tradition of promulgating Katikavat in Sri Lanka originated in order to protect and administer properly the conduct of members of the Maha Sangha who are obliged to protect the Buddha Sasana and the ecclesiastical practices. From the end of the Anuradhapura period until today, on the advice and recommendation of the Maha Theras well versed in the Dhamma and the Vinaya and who bear the responsibility for the perpetuation of the Sasana, our rulers compiled and adopted Vihara (Temple) Katikavat for the administration of Temples and Bhikkhu Katikavat for administering matters relating to the monastic rules of discipline of monks.
At present, in all the three Nikayas, and sometimes in the different chapters of the main Nikayas, katikavat have been prepared keeping in mind the aforesaid purposes. The responsible monks of the respective Nikayas have prepared these katikavat not at the behest of government but following tradition in order to administer well the bikkhus of a particular Nikaya, the temples, monasteries and the temple-land they hold; and more particularly, for the purpose of bringing into being a well disciplined bikkhu society.
When implementing the provisions of these katikavat that have been prepared according to the Dhamma and the Vinaya following traditions, the perennial problem has been the lack of any legal backing for such katikavat. It should be understood that by legal backing what is meant is not for the government to force down rules of conduct for monks but to get legality for the consensus and decisions duly taken by the Sangha.
One of the main topics discussed in the Reports of the Buddhist Committee of Inquiry (1954), the Buddha Sasana Commission (1956), the Presidential Buddha Sasana Commission (2002), the 2550 Buddha Jayanthi (2006), the 2600 Sambuddhatva Jayanthi (2011) and other such memorable occasions was the promulgation of Bikkhu Katikavat. Hence, it is commendable that the present government has gazetted a Bill for the Registration of Theravada Bikkhu Nikaya Katikavat in compliance with the wishes expressed by the Maha Theras versed in the Dhamma and the Vinaya; thereby fulfilling a need of the Maha Sangha.
At the moment, there is wide discussion on certain defects and shortcomings of the Katikavat Registration Bill. The Buddha Sasana Karya Sadhaka Mandalaya that has the four Most Venerable Mahanayaka Theras as its Anusasakas, has discussed the Bill in minute detail and a set of important recommendations have been submitted. It is the considered view of the Sri Lanka Amarapura Mahasangha Sabha that the adoption by Parliament of the Bill after incorporating the suggested amendments will be very beneficial to both the Buddha Sasana and the Bikkhu Sangha.

Govt. making different statements on UN resolution: GL
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has not been briefed on the contents of the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka and that is why he makes contradictory statements on it, former external affairs minister G.L. Peiris said.
He said the resolution co-sponsored by the US and Sri Lanka had clearly laid down the time frame for the investigation of war crimes charges and the involvement of foreign experts in the mechanism.
"However, President repeatedly denies the involvement of foreign expertise in a domestic mechanism and says the government can't rush the investigation. The sixth paragraph of the resolution clearly mentions the involvement of foreign judges," Mr. Peiris said.
He said the 18th paragraph states that a preliminary report of the investigation should be submitted to the UNHRC at its 32nd session in September this year and a full report to the 34th session in September next year.
Mr. Peiris said the President had also claimed that the government won't execute all the proposals imposed by other countries and that it would decide what is good for the country and then implement those proposals.
We could have done that if the proposals were brought by some other country but this resolution was co-sponsored by Sri Lanka and the government requested all other countries at the UNHRC to pledge their support to the resolution. Then how can we say we will implement only a part of the proposals," he asked.
Mr. Peiris said the government had agreed through the seventh paragraph to abolish the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and to amend the Public Security Ordinance Act.
"President says no external forces will be allowed to intervene in our internal affairs but Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the government was standing by the UNHRC resolution. The government has no single policy on the resolution," he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Govt. working on reconciliation: PM
	
Prime Minster Ranil Wickremesinghe inaugurating the Commonwealth Asia Regional Seminar for parliamentarians in Colombo on Monday clarified about how foreign judges could participate in the accountability mechanism.
"The composition of the Supreme Court is decided by the constitution. So who can be members of the final body is decided by the constitution and they have to be citizens of Sri Lanka. We have no provision here to have foreign judges just as much as in your countries there are no provisions for foreign judges. But that does not preclude Commonwealth judges from participation in the process. Then there will be the big question of who shall be prosecutors. That, neither the President nor I nor Parliament can decide. We like yours have the same system, the Bar jealously guards their rights and the Supreme Court decides who should be admitted. If you have passed your exams.. all and good. If you are not a lawyer of your own country, the only way is to go before the Supreme Court. If you are going to change that system the Supreme Court will say it requires a referendum. So within this we will look at how judges would participate," he told participating parliamentarians from Commonwealth countries at the regional seminar. The Prime Minister however said Sri Lanka would have to strengthen its judiciary to ensure an effective accountability process and would work with South Africa in setting up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
He said a technical team and some ministers from Sri Lanka will visit that country shortly for an indepth study on setting up a Reconciliation Commission to suit Sri Lankas needs.
Reconciliation and Accountability should complement each other because there will be no accountability without reconciliation and vice versa, the Premier said recalling that a resident of Kilinochchi had told him that what they needed most was to rebuild their livelihoods and secure lost property because nothing would be gained even if cases were filed against all security forces' personnel.
He said this person also told him that they were keen to find out what happened to their lost loved ones and bring about a closure once and for all to the pain in their hearts and minds.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said oversight committees would be set up in few months. In a few months you will be able to see the strongest Parliament in Asia, he therefore said. (Yohan Perera)

Speaking to the media outside the Welikada prison, MP Dinesh Gunawardena said the current regime is taking revenge from Yoshitha and the others because it was unable to hurt former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The five in remand custody can be described as political prisoners because they were remanded for political reasons and were arrested according to a political plan, he said.
Mr. Weerawansa said Yoshitha was innocent because he did not hold any post in the CSN. Even Yoshithas name is not mentioned in any official document, he said. He has been remanded on false allegations to keep Mahinda Rajapaksa out of politics.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Singing National Anthem in Sinhala, Tamil no issue: Minister
	
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardana today said singing the National Anthem at the 68th Independence Day celebrations at Galle Face in Sinhala and Tamil was not an issue because the Constitution clearly states that Sinhala and Tamil are national languages and as such it could be sung in both languages at any State function.
He told the media at the Prime Ministers office that the singing of the National Anthem in Tamil was not a new phenomenon because the National Anthem was sung in Tamil at the first Independence Day celebrations in 1948 and at many State functions since then.
One must realize that there is no use of singing the National Anthem in Sinhala in Kilinochchi or in Tamil in Matara. The government has done much for reconciliation and promoting communal harmony following the electoral victories of January 8 and August 17 last year. The 68th Independence Day celebrations will be a catalyst to the positive developments in the country, the minister said.
He said the official 68th Independence Day celebrations will be held at Galle Face Green on Thursday from 8.00 am to 12.00 noon.
The main ceremony will be more colourful with the singing of the National Anthem, Jayamangala Gatha and Devo Wassathu Kalena by a bevy of girls from 13 schools.
Nearly 8,917 personnel from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Police and Civil Defence Force will take part in the march past.
There will be a 21-Gun Salute to President Maithripala Sirisena by the Sri Lanka Army and a 25-gun salute to the Nation by the Sri Lanka Navy.
The Buddhist, Hindu, Christian and Muslim religious ceremonies for the 68th Independence Day celebrations will be begin today with an all-night Pirith chanting ceremony at the Independence Hall.
The Traffic Police has put in place a special traffic plan effective from Tuesday to Thursday.
