Age limit for trishaw drivers transporting people
	
Legal age limit for trishaw drivers who provide public transport should be increased to 25, Chairman of the National Council for Road Safety, Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said today.
He said those who were below 25 years of age should not be allowed to transport people considering the safety of the passengers.
Responding to a question, Mr. Kodagoda said a probation period of at least two years should also be given to them.
He said the National Council for Road Safety would inform the relevant government authorities to work on their proposal regarding the age limit.
?This proposal is to ensure the safety of the passengers because many of the fatal? accidents involving three-wheelers have been driven by drivers below 25,? he said.

## Title: Ceylinco Insurance September quarter profit falls 20% but premiums rise

Ceylinco Insurance September quarter profit falls 20% but premiums rise
	
Ceylinco Insurance PLC, which runs Sri Lanka?s market-leading life insurance business based on gross written premiums (GWPs), saw its September quarter (3Q16) net profits falling by 20 percent to Rs.850.9 million or Rs.32.21 a share from a year ago, the interim results released to the Colombo Stock Exchange showed.?
However, the GWPs from both life and non-life businesses rose by 17 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.8.13 billion during the quarter.?
The investment and other incomes grew by 37 percent to Rs.2.87 billion from a year ago as the interest rates increased during the period. According to industry regulations, it is mandated for the insurers to invest a section of their assets in government securities.
In line with the regulator?s call, Ceylinco Insurance, which ran both life and non-life businesses as a composite insurer, segregated its business in June 2015 by creating fully-owned subsidiaries for each business segment, Ceylinco Insurance PLC becoming only the holding company.?
Based on the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL) data, up to 2015, Ceylinco?s life insurance business had a little over 25 percent market share. This was followed by 19.35 percent share held by the state-owned Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation and 15.74 percent share by AIA Life Insurance. ? ??
Meanwhile, both life and non-life companies of the group paid a total claims and benefits of Rs.3.43 billion, an increase of 16 percent from the same period last year.?
The total claims and benefits paid during the first nine months was as high as Rs.10.0 billion.?
?The sharp increase in claim settlement is a result of the large number of flood claims we paid,? said Ceylinco General Insurance Limited Managing Director Patrick Alwis in a statement.?
Many parts of the country were badly affected by the floods that took place this May. ?Meanwhile, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the company made a net profit of Rs.2.22 billion or Rs.84.09 a share, up 21 percent from the same period last year.?
The total GWP rose by 15 percent YoY to Rs.23.5 billion.?
The non-life business GWP grew by 23.2 percent on year to Rs.12.0 billion while the life business GWP rose by 11.1 percent on year to Rs.11.0 billion.?
Investment and other incomes during the period rose by a healthy 23 percent YoY to Rs.7.5 billion.?
By the end of September 30, 2016, Global Rubber Industries (Private) Limited held 22.25 percent stake in Ceylinco, followed by Banque Pictet & Cie SA with a 12.73 percent stake. Sri Lanka?s overcrowded insurance industry is now ripe for consolidation and during the last two years, the industry saw some of the companies shedding their less profitable non-life businesses to focus on the life business.

Dead girl won historic ruling to preserve her body
	
A 14-year-old girl who wanted her body to be preserved, in case she could be cured in the future, won a historic legal fight shortly before her death, BBC reported today.
The girl, who was terminally ill with a rare cancer, was supported by her mother in her wish to be cryogenically preserved - but not by her father.
She wrote to the judge explaining that she wanted "to live longer" and did not want "to be buried underground".
The girl, who died in October, has been taken to the US and preserved there.
A High Court judge ruled that the girl's mother should be allowed to decide what happened to the body.
The details of her case have just been released.
The teenager, who lived in the London area and cannot be named, used the internet to investigate cryonics during the last months of her life.
The judge, Mr. Justice Peter Jackson, visited the girl in hospital and said he was moved by "the valiant way in which she was facing her predicament".
His ruling, he said, was not about the rights or wrongs of cryonics but about a dispute between parents over the disposal of their daughter's body.
It was brought to court for the first time on 26 September and the judge made his decision on 6 October.
Mr. Justice Jackson said the case was an example of science posing new questions to lawyers.
The girl died peacefully in October knowing that her remains would be preserved, but the judge said there had been problems on the day she died.
He said hospital staff and bosses had expressed concerns about the way the process of preparing her body for cryogenic preservation had been handled.
This was carried out by a voluntary group in the UK before her body was flown to the US for storage.
He suggested that ministers should consider "proper regulation" of cryonic preservation for the future.
What is Cryonics?
Cryonics is the process of preserving a whole body in the hope that resuscitation and a cure are possible in the distant future.
It is a controversial procedure and no-one yet knows if it is possible to bring people back to life.
There are facilities in the US and Russia where bodies can be preserved in liquid nitrogen at very low temperatures (less than -130C) - but not in the UK.
The cost of preserving the body for an infinite amount of time in this case was ?37,000.
The teenager's letter to the judge
"I have been asked to explain why I want this unusual thing done.
"I am only 14 years old and I don't want to die but I know I am going to die.
"I think being cryopreserved gives me a chance to be cured and woken up - even in hundreds of years' time.
"I don't want to be buried underground.
"I want to live and live longer and I think that in the future they may find a cure for my cancer and wake me up.
"I want to have this chance.
"This is my wish."

Harry J tells PM to seek wise counsel of corporate leaders prior to foreign tours
	
Business tycoon Harry Jayawardena, who is known as an outspoken personality, this week told a packed business gathering in Colombo, where the country?s Prime Minister was also present, that views should be obtained from top business leaders when top government officials go on foreign tours.
??When you go abroad, you must consult us. All of us are here because of our achievements, so we have that knowledge to share with you. But you?re busy most of the time,? Jaywardena complained to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Responding to Jayawardena, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, who in his speech delivered a scathing attack on the Wijeya Newspaper Group?s financial daily Daily FT, said that the businessmen had forgotten that Sri Lanka?s first Executive President J.R.Jayewardene?s favourite song was Frank Sinatra?s ?I did it my way?.
?Even I would have done it my way, but now it is our way. So we must all come together to rebuild the country,? Wickremesinghe quipped. Wickremesinghe is the nephew of late J.R.Jayewrdene.
Meanwhile, clearly with reference to the higher taxes the government has imposed to plug the country?s ever-expanding budget deficit, Jayawardena said, ?I must also say that the Finance Minister knows us very well. It is true that they should get the funds from people who have the funds. But don?t try to tax us too much,? he added. (Supun Dias)

Opposition to National Anthem in Tamil: SC dismisses FR petition
	
A Supreme Court Bench comprising Justices Priyasath Dep, K.T. Chitrasiri and Prasanna S. Jayawardene today refused to grant leave to proceed with the petition challenging the singing of the National Anthem in Tamil.
Petitioners Sudath Perera, Pradeep Asiri Soysa and G.A.D. Premaratne cited President Maithripala Sirisena and the Attorney General as respondents and said they it was on February 4, 2016 at the Independence Day celebration that they became aware of the national anthem being sung in Tamil.
They said it was a gross violation of Article 7 of the Constitution and it was arbitrary and capricious and crass violation of the principle of equality and of the rights of all citizens.
The petitioners said the words ?Namo Namo Matha? had been substituted by ?Sri Lanka Matha?.
Meanwhile, two intervernient petitions were filed by Ven. Gonagala Gnanaloka Thera of the Sri Sugathamaha Viharaya in Anuradhapura and the Centre for Policy Alternatives challenging the rights petition.
They maintained that the Constitution did not stipulate that the national anthem should only be sung in Sinhala and that Article 18 and 19 of the Constitution clearly and had unambiguously stated that Sinhala and Tamil shall be the official and national languages of Sri Lanka.
The intervenient petitioners said there was no inconsistency between the Constitution and the decision to sing the national anthem in Tamil.
Manohara de Silva PC appeared for the petitioners. Viran Corea instructed by Moahan Balendra appeared for the intervenient petitioner CPA and Suren Fernando and Pulasthi Hewamanna for the intervenient petitioner Ven. Gonagala Gnanaloka Thera.

Vehicles for 58 MPs-25 Mn as Imp. duty on each: Ravi
	
The Government will receive Rs.25 million as import duty for each of the 58 vehicles which are to be given to 58 MPs, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake told Parliament today.
He said this in response to a question asked by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Thursday and added that the government would actually save money through this transaction.
?The vehicles will be imported by a private company on an operational lease and therefore it would be possible to save a considerable amount of funds," the minister said adding that the cost of repairs would have to be borne by the importer and as such there would be a reduction on the expenditure involved.
The minister said there were several instances where bills were being produced by those using state vehicles to get funds reimbursed but an operational lease would prevent such eventually in the future.
He said the MPs were being paid Rs.200,000 as transport allowance because the tender process for ordering the new vehicles took time.
"In future all vehicles for State use will be acquired on an operational lease except those imported for use by the President and the Prime Minister," he said.
He said government MPs needed vehicles because they had to carry out various kinds of work for the people. (Yohan Perera)
