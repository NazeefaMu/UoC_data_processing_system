A sensible team should be sent: JO
	
A team of experts with some sense of diplomatic relations should be sent to Russia which suspended the import of Sri Lankan tea, joint opposition member and Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardana said today.
He said Russia was the biggest importer of our tea and as such this matter must be solved as soon as possible and the issue was much more than the detection of an insect in the packaging of a consignment of tea.
?It goes without saying that Sri Lanka's international image has been tarnished by this,? the MP told a news conference. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Amtrak train derails over highway in Washington; injuries reported
	
An Amtrak passenger train derailed Monday morning, spilling multiple cars off an Interstate 5 overpass in Pierce County, Washington, according to the Washington state Department of Transportation's Twitter account.
Injuries and casualties have been reported, the Pierce County Sheriff's Office and Amtrak said.
All southbound lanes of the interstate are closed due to the derailment and the sight stunned motorists heading to work.
"I was traveling to work this morning along I-5 and we came to a sudden stop," Greg Mukai told CNN. "We all tried to stop quickly to avoid running into each other to be honest. Once we all came to a stop I was able to look up and see, unfortunately, this scary thing of ... a train hanging off of the overpass. Lots of military personnel and people ran to try to help the best they could."
Danae Orlob told CNN there was a semi and a crushed truck underneath the train cars.
"We came around the corner and it had to have just happened...there were no police there yet. There was one link of the train off to one side and the other on the other side of the freeway. There were crushed cars underneath. There was an insane amount of fire trucks and ambulances heading towards us."
Amtrak said it is aware of the incident involving the 501 train which travels from Seattle to Portland, Oregon.
According to an online schedule, the 501 train is one of Amtrak's Cascades trains, which they say "connect 18 cities along the I-5 corridor including Seattle, Portland, Vancouver, BC, and Eugene, Oregon."
The National Transportation Safety Board tweeted that the Amtrak train that derailed is a passenger train.
"NTSB is gathering information about an accident involving an Amtrak passenger train near Seattle, Washington. Additional information to follow when available."
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee tweeted, "Thank you to the first responders on the scene. We're praying for everyone on board the train, and ask everyone to hold them in your thoughts." (CNN)

Commercial Bank of Ceylon recently conducted its 67th entrepreneur development seminar as part of its ongoing initiative to develop the entrepreneurship skills of SMEs in the country.
The seminar organised by the bank?s development credit department in Wadduwa for 140 entrepreneurs operating in the Kalutara district, brought the total number of entrepreneurs trained from all provinces of the country to 6,400.
Serving as the resource person, Chandana Gunawardena, a leading speaker on motivation and business development, emphasised the importance of business development and sustainability for SME entrepreneurs.
The programme was inaugurated by Commercial Bank Development Credit Department Senior Manager Mohan Fernando with the Managers of the bank?s Aluthgama, Bandaragama, Kalutara, Matugama, Panadura and Wadduwa branches and officers of the Development Credit Department and the South Western Regional Office of Commercial Bank in attendance.

Courts to hear 20 corruption cases a day to punish wrongdoers:PM
	
Arrangements have been made to hear 20 court cases dealing with corruption on a daily basis with a view of expediting the process of penalising wrongdoers, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
The Prime Minister revealed this while speaking at the UNP Bala Mandala meeting in Maharagama yesterday evening. ?Some are questioning us about the pledge the government gave during the last election to eradicate Corruption and to penalize those who have robbed public funds. I have already discussed this issue with the attorney general and a decision has been made to expedite the hearing of 20 court cases," the Prime Minister said.
However, Mr. Wickremesinghe pointed out that the court cases would be conducted within the existing judicial system. This he said is because one cannot go out of the existing legal framework to punish those who are facing corruption charges.
?One of the changes we have brought about is with regard to conducting probes on allegations that are brought against members of the government itself. We have got ministers who are facing such allegations to resign from their posts. This is one change this government has made. Another change is media freedom. The media is now free to criticize the actions of the government. Media personnel either disappeared or were killed during the last regime if they criticized the government. We have also introduced an insurance scheme for school children and increased the allocation of funds for the education sector," he added.
He also re-iterated that the government has been able to be validated and get the assistance of world leaders to develop the country. ?The Malaysian Prime Minister is here on an official visit and the Singaporean Prime Minister will also be visiting the country next month.
?Some have question us on the slowness they see when it comes to development work in the country. We are moving slowly in order to safeguard the changes we have brought about. We can move faster but then we run the risk of losing what we have achieved so far," he explained. The Prime Minister also pledged to arrest the debt crisis that presently exists in the country.
Minister of Megapolis Patali Champika Ranawaka who also addressed those present said the joint opposition including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and MP Dinesh Gunawardene actually wants the UNP to win the local government election. He said this government is not engaged in forceful development which is done by grabbing public lands.
Minister Harin Fernando, who was also present, said the UNP would have swept the local government election if it was held on schedule in 2015. However, he said the policy of this government was to ensure that a new electoral system was put in place and to see that women receive adequate representation in local bodies. ?My prediction is that the UNP will become even more powerful and would even have the chance to form a government on its own after it emerges victorious at the upcoming local government polls," he said.(Yohan Perera)

Elegy for Lankan guitars
	
No Lankan business concern has thought of investing in this guitar making venture -all offers come from abroad
H. A. Dharmasena began making guitars when he was a teenager. Now eighty, he?s still making them. Guitar making definitely runs in the family.? ?
His son Kithsiri Hathurusinghe dropped the idea of becoming a doctor and joined his father to make guitars. And now, 23-year-old grandson Bhagya Madhushan too, is in the spacious workshop at home, making guitars.? ?
From their modest home in Kolonnawa, these three-generation guitar-making families make and sell guitars all over the country. But Dharmasena sounds like a disappointed man, talking about lost opportunities and lack of appreciation towards a craftsman working hard to compete with cheap imports from China and India.?
?We can make guitars as good as any in the world,? Dharmasena says.? ?
?But we need support from the Government, which we have never been given.?? ?
Things were better before the open economy opened a floodgate to cheap imports in 1978.? ?
But Dharmasena recalls T. B. Ilangaratne, Minister of Trade for the socialist Government elected in 1970, objecting to a deal offered by an American guitar maker impressed with his home-made guitars.? ?
"T. B. Ilangaratne, Minister of Trade for the socialist Government elected in 1970, objecting to a deal offered by an American guitar maker impressed with his home-made guitars"
?
Even so, the 60s and 70s were good times comparatively, when Dharmasena had dealers selling his products all over the country. He had assistants and his firm made not only guitars but violins, too.? ?
?I stopped making violins after cheap Chinese products flooded the market, but I kept this as a souvenir,? Dharmasena said, showing me a beautifully finished sample.? ?
Though he started making guitars at age 16, the first musical instrument he touched was an English mandolin. But it?s the guitar, which seized his mind and imagination as he became acquainted with a man who repaired guitars.? ?
Though he never learned to play the instrument, Dharmasena quickly grasped the essentials of making an acoustic guitar.? ?
Today, half-finished guitars hang in parts of the family workshop. One made by Dharmasena over 40 years ago has returned to the workshop for a repair. Other guitars ranging from an electric bass to a lead guitar lie on tables, as the firm undertakes repairs, too.? ?
"A popular Music Company made an offer once. But the company wanted us to sign a contract very much in their favour, forcing us to supply guitars at a fixed rate for five years. That was simply too risky "
?
The firm, known as New Tone, has an outlet at Wellawatte, but the sons, as well as a grandson, are content to be in the workshop. One can see that this is their universe.? ?
Every guitar is hand-made, with a metal mould being used to shape the wood into the familiar bulbous shape of the guitar frame.? ?
Imported hardwoods are needed for the fingerboard, but the body is made from local woods such as mahogany. Teak, Jak-wood and satinwood are too hard. It takes a single craftsman one week to finish a guitar, and another week to finish the paintwork. Clear weather is needed for the painting as the workshop isn?t humidity-controlled, and applying the gums too, cannot be done when it rains.? Dharmasena is pessimistic about the future, but remains confident that his son and grandson will continue the family tradition.? ?
"The struggle this guitar maker and his family have waged in the face of adversity and market forces unleashed by changing times is nothing short of heroic"
?
No Lankan business concern has thought of investing in this guitar making venture. All such offers have come from abroad.? ?
But, due to bad luck and other mitigating factors, nothing has worked for them.? ?
?Even a popular Music Company made an offer once. But the company wanted us to sign a contract very much in their favour, forcing us to supply guitars at a fixed rate for five years. That was simply too risky, so we turned it down,? Dharmasena said.? ?
The struggle this guitar maker and his family have waged in the face of adversity and market forces unleashed by changing times is nothing short of heroic. One senses a strong will to persevere against the odds.??

Goodbye and good luck Sri Lanka
	
I am confident that China-Sri Lanka longstanding friendship and mutually beneficial and inclusive cooperation will continue?
The following article is penned by the outgoing Chinese Ambassador to?
Sri Lanka Yi Xianliang
I am going to complete my assignment and return to my motherland.
On February 24, 2015, I arrived in Colombo and started my assignment as the 20th Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka. During the past two years and nine months, I traveled to all 9 provinces and 25 districts of Sri Lanka, made a lot of local friends and witnessed the China-Sri Lanka relations overcome obstacles, move forward and usher in new development opportunities.
China and Sri Lanka have maintained close high-level exchanges and deepened mutual trust. H.E. President Sirisena paid a state visit to China at the beginning of his presidency and held fruitful meetings with H.E. President Xi Jinping, indicating the direction for the sustained and in-depth development of China-Sri Lanka relations.
The two leaders have maintained close communication on international and regional occasions. Hon. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe successfully made official visit and work visit to China and attended the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, further promoting the deepening of China-Sri Lanka pragmatic cooperation. Hon. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and H.E. Yu Zhengsheng, Chairman of the Chinese People?s Political Consultative Conference, exchanged visits. Bilateral exchanges and cooperation in various fields have been continuously expanded.
The mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Sri Lanka has achieved new development and brought tangible benefits to the two peoples. At present, China has become the largest trading partner, the largest infrastructure construction partner of Sri Lanka and the largest source country of investment, donation and assistance to Sri Lanka. The economic and trade cooperation between China and Sri Lanka has created more than 100,000 jobs, trained tens of thousands of technical and managerial talents, and played an irreplaceable role in the economic and social development of Sri Lanka.
Under the guidance of the Belt and Road Initiative and the concept of engaging in extensive consultation, making joint contribution and sharing benefits, the cooperation between China and Sri Lanka is striding forward. The Port City and Hambantota Comprehensive development projects are taking off together, further facilitating the development of China-Sri Lanka pragmatic cooperation.
China and Sri Lanka are friends in need. The Chinese people will not forget the precious support that the Sri Lankan government and people gave to the Chinese people when disasters like Wenchuan Earthquake hit China.
Likewise, whenever Sri Lanka is faced with natural disasters, the Chinese government and people empathize with Sri Lankan friends and always provide assistance to the government and people within our capacity. The Chinese people with the peculiar characters of sincere, amity, pragmatism and efficiency, will work together with the Sri Lankan people to build a more richly endowed, more prosperous, more modern and more industrialized Sri Lanka.
China- Sri Lanka millennium friendship is shining in a new era through cultural exchanges and mutual learning. Both China and Sri Lanka are ancient civilizations. Buddhism has been the shared culture of the two countries over 1600 years. I am glad to see that the cultural exchanges in Buddhism, tourism and education and so on are becoming increasingly popular. The Buddhist monks of the two countries maintain close exchanges and keep learning from each other. China is one of the largest tourist source countries of Sri Lanka.
The ubiquitous Chinese tourists have not only contributed to the economic development of Sri Lanka, but also enhanced the understanding and friendship between our two peoples. The Chinese government provides Sri Lanka more than 100 government scholarships and 2,000 trainingships every year.
15 Sri Lankan universities have established Chinese Ambassador Scholarship. The Chinese philharmonic orchestra, the Shaolin monks? wushu troupe, and other Chinese cultural troupes with Chinese characteristics are warmly welcomed in Sri Lanka. More and more Sri Lankan friends are learning Chinese, they will become new envoys for China-Sri Lanka friendship in the future. History is a mirror that reflects the boom and bust. The flourishing relations between China and Sri Lanka tell that the historical friendship between China and Sri Lanka is unstoppable.
This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka. We are proud of the achievements of our relations in the past 60 years. At present, China-Sri Lanka relations have entered a new fast track under the guidance of Belt and Road initiative. I am confident that China-Sri Lanka longstanding friendship and mutually beneficial and inclusive cooperation will continue to create new wonders for the benefit of the two countries and the two peoples and make important contributions to peace and development in the Indian Ocean region. Dear friends, Sri Lanka has become my second hometown. The honest and friendly Sri Lankan people, the mountains and rivers, the flowers and trees of the beautiful island nation, will become my sweet and permanent memories. The experience here will be the invaluable wealth of my life. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to H.E. President Sirisena, Hon. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, Hon. Speaker Jayasuriya, ministers, parliamentarians and the Sri Lankan people for your precious support for carrying out my competence. In the future, wherever I am, I will continue to pay attention to Sri Lanka and support the development of China-Sri Lanka relations.
Sincere and indeed friends won?t become alienated because of the distance. Goodbye and good luck, Sri Lanka!

Locally made anti-venom soon

An Anti-Venom Serum for snake reptile bites will soon see the day, from the Centre of Tropical Medicine based at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Peradeniya.??
The Director of the Centre Professor S.A.M. Kularatne, Senior Professor and Chair of Medicine said that he and a team had been working on this aspect for some years and that it was possible before long, to bring out an Anti-Venom Serum produced locally against the snake bites and stings of the reptiles in this country.
At the second International Conference on Tropical Medicine held over the weekend (December 8 and 9) there were a number of presentations, two of which covered the subject of snake bites.
Technical Director of Serum and Vaccine Centre in the District of Pune, India said that millions of people suffer from snake bites and also scorpion stings.

"Technical Director of Serum and Vaccine Centre in the District of Pune, India said that millions of people suffer from snake bites and also scorpion stings."
Every year in the world majority of the victims require anti venom treatment to prevent death, amputation or severe neurological disorders.
The process of producing anti venom is technically challenging. It is very important to delicately balance the productivity with the health of the donor animals.
Production of anti venom rising animals is becoming objectionable and the search for alternative methods of production, such as the use of egg yolk, mono-colonial antibodies as well as herbal anti-venoms are been investigated, he said.
Dr. Anjana Silva from Rajarata University Medical Faculty is also studying anti-venoms.
The Keynote Address was delivered at this second Congress on the theme Global Alliance to combat Tropical Disease by Professor J.S.M. Pieris of the University of Hong Kong, Chair Professor on Virology.
He delivered his address titled Emerging Respiratory Viral Infections: From Influenza to MERS.
Professor Pieris said that novel emerging infectious diseases continue to arise in the 21st century posting unexpected threats.
While outbreaks such as Ebola and Zika have attracted much recent attention, respiratory epidemics are unique in the rapidity with which they spread across geographical boundaries, potentially leading to major social, economic and political as well as human health impact
Two respiratory viral infections of current concern are influenza and MERS. Influenza A (H3N2) and ( H1N1) and B Viruses cause repeated seasonal outbreaks though mutation in the virus surface proteins that allow emergence of variant viruses that evade pre- existing population immunity.
Seasonal influenza epidemics are estimated to infect ten to twenty percent of global population causing three to five million severe cases of Influenza disease and 0.3 - 0.67 million deaths (Largely to the elderly) every year.
Professor Pieris said that such outbreaks occur in most parts of the world, no region being exempt. Groups at risk of increased morbidity and mortality include young children and the elderly, pregnant women , those with underlying heart, lung ,kidney , liver or endocrine ( e.g. Diabetes ) diseases.
Antivirus therapy or high risk patients can reduce morbidity and mortality and vaccination can protect against infection and disease. Pandemic influenza arises from influenza in animals and occurs at less predictable intervals but can cause height morbidity and mortality.
Another study presented at this Congress was on? Hantavirus Infection and Chronic Kidney Disease by Ms Kumilo Yoshimatsu, from the Department of Microbiology, Hokkaido University, said that Hantaviruses cause a rodent borne Zootomic disease, Haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome ( HFRS), chronic kidney disease ( CKD) is recognized as a major public health problem worldwide.
A high prevalence in Chronic Kidney Disease in cases has been noted in the North Central Province of Sri Lanka since 1990?s,without known risk factors .
This disease, Dr. Yosshimatsu said is known as CKD or Chronic Kidney disease of Unknown Aetiology.
She said it has been reported that significant high seroprevalence of Hantavirus among CKD patients from Sri Lanka. (Seroprevalence is the number of persons in a population who test positive for a specific disease based on serology (blood serum) specimens; often presented as a percent of the total specimens tested or as a proportion per 100,000 persons tested.)
In her study, she says that it further examined the relationship between Hantavirus infection and CKDu by examination of Hantavirus seroptyping and seroprevalence in a new endemic area.
Dr. Yoshimatsu says that a total of 131 sera from CKDu patients and 200 serum samples were obtained from a CKDu endemic area, Girandurukotte, in the Badulla District.
Similarly 19 serum samples from CKDu patients and 50 control sera were collected from Wigamuwa, a sporadic endemic site in the Matale District. A total of 481 control sera were obtained from a known - endemic area of Matale district. Serum antibody level were screened by direct immuno-fluorescent antibody assay against Seoul, Thailand and Puumala virus antigens.
She says that Seroprevalence among CKDu patients (47.3%. 47%.4%) as higher than those among the control area ( 13.5 %-18% in Girandurukotte Wilgamuwa respectively.
Dr. Yoshimatsu concluded that to clarify the relationship between Hantavirus and Chronic Kidney Disease further extensive investigations in humans and rats are necessary.
Fourteen Research findings were presented.
Among the others who addressed the Congress were Professor R. Mudyanse, Professor S.A.M. Kularatne. Deputy Vice Chancellor Lakshman Wijeweera and Vice Chancellor Upul B. Dissanayake and Dr. Susiji Wickramasinghe.

Madugalle the forgotten hero
	
The man who set the ball rolling for the Independence of the country has been forgotten though he had paid twice for his?bold stand.
He was the first to be sentenced to the fort of Jaffna for two years hard labour. That was two hundred and one years ago, on December? 7, 1816- two years before the famous rebellion.
?
This fact has been forgotten by many.
The man was none other than Sri Wickramrajasinghe?s Udagabada Nilame Madugalle - the Dissava of Wellassa.
The British on March 4, 1815, re-appointed him as the Udagabada Nilame with the Title of Dissava of Wellassa as he was reputed and a highly respected warrior and the best swordsman in the Kandyan Kingdom.
Though there are various schools of thought, yet there has been no one to pinpoint, why Keppetipla Maha Dissava left his position at the uprising at Paranagama and fled to Anuradhapura, where he surrendered to the British.
I met Professor Vimalananda Tennakoon, at Kelaniya, surrounded with his film strips brought from the British archives, but he himself was questioning as to why he left delegating his leadership to Madugalle.
This has so far not been answered, though there are various schools of thought.
However, Madugalle was sentenced by an ad-hoc inquiry headed by Sir John D?Oyly.
This was spearheaded by Millewa Dissave and Ekeelligoda when they told? D?Oyly that Madugalle was organizing a conspiracy to oust the British from Kandyan soil.
?
"The British also feared Madugalle, as a great warrior and a brilliant swordsman. Keppetipola Maha Dissava was a respected man."
?
It was said that Madugalle Dissava had gone to the Kovil at Bintenna to seek the blessings of God Kataragama to pray that the British be got rid of from the Kandyan Territory.
The second was that Madugalle Dissava had tried to spirit away the Icon of the Kandyan people, the Sacred Tooth Relic and that the Mahanayake of Malwatte had known about it.
On these two flimsy tales, Madugalle was summoned to the Magul Maduwa or the Audience Hall for an inquiry of a board composed of Kandyan Nilames and Army officers to hear what has to be said by Madugalle Dissava.
He accepted the first charge that he did send some persons to the Kovil at Binntenna to seek the help of the God for some valuables lost in his household, but denied that mission was for the purpose of sending the British away from the country.
The second charge was denied and he said he did not seek the blessings of the Mahanayake of Malwatte to remove the sacred relic from where it was placed.
D?Oyly was no fool and knew the ways of the Nilames, from the time of his days at Matara, where he was friendly with Koratota Thera and from where he was spying on the Kandy realm.
?
So, without his taking the total blame, he summoned the Nilames to conduct the inquiry, headed by him and with the aid of some officers of the Artillery.
D?Oyly questioned the Chiefs as to the punishment, should the suspect be found guilty.
Their answer was death and the confiscation of property. With this Madugalle Dissave was summoned and when Madugalle Dissava came before a stunned committee, he was served with those two charges.
The Nilames had doubts of his appearing before the Committee, but when he did, they thought of making a quick rift, if not they knew what would befall them.
He did accept the charge of the incident of sending people to the Kovil at Bintenna but denied a hand in suggesting the removal of the Sacred Tooth Relic.
?
"Without his taking the total blame, he summoned the Nilames to conduct the inquiry, headed by him and with the aid of some officers "
?
D?Oyly immediately summoned the Maha Gabada Nilame Madugalle and Venerable Ihalagama Ratnapala Thera before the Committee. On the second charge, which was denied by Madugalle D?Oyly sent the newly appointed Maha Gabada Nilame and Kodditukkukara Lekam to Malwatte Vihara to bring a written statement from the Mahanayake of Malwatte as for the veracity of the statement made by Madugalle Dissave. The Mahanayake of Malwatte denied his involvement and said that the Nilame suggested but had advised him to be cautious of such a move.
Armed with this document, D?Oyly moved the committee to make a judgment, which they did by announcing that Madugalle Dissava was guilty. The decision was then transferred to Colombo for the decision of Governor Sir Robert Brownrigg. He made an order that Madugalle Dissava - the Udagabada Nilame be sentenced two years to the Fort of Jaffna.
The British also feared Madugalle, as a great warrior and a brilliant swordsman. Keppetipola Maha Dissava was a respected man.
Udagabada Nilame now stripped off of his Titles and was sent to Colombo in a Palanquin and guarded. After the delivery of the sentence by Brownrigg, the Nilame was sent to Jaffna Fort through Negombo and Wattala.
The position Udagabada Nilame was filled by Dehigama Hannabaddea Nilame as Udagabada Nilame. Madugalle?s lands were confiscated. But the order of the Governor had specifically stated that his relatives would not be penalised as some of them were in the service of the British.
Though Madugalle Dissava was sentenced to two years, yet with the Birthday celebrations of Prince Regent who was to become George the Fourth, Madugalle was given a pardon. Madugalle came back and resided in Dumbara, his native village. While, at Dumbara he waited for a rebellion, which he thought would come some day and it did.
This was the time when a pretender was loitering around the Kandyan Realm calling himself a relative of the last King of Kandy.
But Madugalle waited for the rebellion to enter the Dumbara territory and then joined forces. But, he had a taste of Kandyan conspiracy around the Nilames.
Keppetipola led the rebellion with the murder of Government Agent Wilson and the arrival of Keppetipola Maha Dissava to quell the rebellion as ordered by the British and then Keppetipola joining the rebellion. Keppetipola later fled, leaving Madugalle to lead, but he could not go far with the rebels deserting the field, due to the addition of armed mercenary of the British drawn from India.
So in 1816, it was Madugalle who was tried for Treason by the British and the first to be tried on that charge. So he was convicted twice, in 1816 and 1818. After he was beheaded on the Banks of Bogambara wewa, his wife was sent to Kalutara and his four children and mother were sent to Colombo. They, in turn, held office in the Kandyan Kingdom
The widow of Madugalle married Kotuwegedera Lekam and thus ended the saga of Madugalle Dissave, the best swordsman of the Kandyan Kingdom.

Reconciliation and unity through Language Speaking Clubs (LSC)
	
For a nation to have the unity there should be a good communication among each other among the communities.
In communication, there are various ways and means to communicate with each other as human beings than the other animals. Language is the main tool that humans use to communicate.
As a person, we use four ways of language skills to have a better communication.
Listening, reading speaking and writing are the four ways of skills that a person should develop to maintain a good communication skill. If a person fails in any one of these skills, one can say that he or she has poor communication skills.
To avoid that problem, improving skills of the second language among citizens is very important.
As a strategy, the 2nd National Language (2NL) development programmes have been implemented in National Colleges of Education.
?
"Language clubs are expected to be more fun when they are multi-generational and multicultural. When members have various target language abilities it is easy to learn the target language ..."
This effort was launched with a wide vision and prospective teachers in the colleges are expected to learn 2NL in order to perform effectively for the benefit of the entire nation as they are suggested to improve the language abilities of the students when they go to the schools.
In addition to that, it will act as a special programme for promoting social cohesion concept through their learning-teaching process.
As a result, prospective teachers are produced to promote peace and harmony through social cohesion and reconciliation.
To be good professionals as well as good human beings it has already been implemented this special language development program as Language speaking clubs (LSC) programme in National Colleges of Education.
Language speaking club is a place for language learners to use the target language in a stress-free environment.
Establishing a language speaking club (Tamil/ Sinhala) is the best way to improve the spoken target language.
Language learners get chances to practise their language skills in a setting that is more similar to their real-life situations.
In addition to that, it is a good way to make new friendships among the members of the club.
Learners get a chance to have good native language friends which motivate the learner confidence and they may feel more comfortable with using the target language with more trust and fun.
In fact, language clubs are expected to be more fun when they are multi-generational and multicultural.
When members have various target language abilities it is easy to learn the target language by focusing different language skills.
National colleges of Education (NCoEs) were established on 1985 as a concept of Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe with the objective of offering teaching qualifications through 3 year, full time, pre-service teacher education programme with utmost aim to improve the quality of the education system by moulding up quality teachers.
In this effort developing language competency of the prospective teachers is very much important as the communicative ability is the main factor of a successful person.
Therefore language ability is an important matter for a person to be successful and through this language speaking club programme, the Government expects to achieve the targets set out in the field of education.
?
"A language speaking club is the best way to improve the spoken target language. Language learners get chances to practise their language skills in a setting similar to their real-life situation situations."
?
This programme is conducted in all the National Colleges of Education as a collaborative effort of Ministry of Education - National Colleges of Education branch, National Institute of Education, University of Colombo and the Goethe Institute with the financial and technical support of GTZ. (Deutsche Gesellschaft for International Zusammenarbeit)

Tea break-- Govt. expects response from Russia today
	
In its effort to secure a lift of the restriction on tea trade, the Sri Lanka embassy in Moscow initiated communication with the Russian authorities and await a response, an official here said yesterday.
Russia said it would impose a temporary restriction on imports of all agricultural products from Sri Lanka, including tea, from December 18 after the detection of an insect known as the Khapra beetle in a consignment of tea from Sri Lanka.
The Russian market accounts for 23 percent of Sri Lanka?s total tea exports. It is the second largest tea market for Sri Lanka, next to Turkey. Russia imported 141, 300 tonnes of tea worth the US $ 436 million up to October, this year.
Asked about steps taken to address the issue, Plantation Industries Ministry Secretary J. A. Ranjith told the Daily Mirror that Sri Lankan embassy had taken up the matter with the Russian authorities.
However, he said the Ministry was awaiting response today for it.
?There is no response yet. We will hear something tomorrow (Monday)," he said.
Though the detection of a beetle was projected as the reason for the restriction on tea trade with Sri Lanka, diplomatic sources said it could be done in retaliation by Russia for the Sri Lankan Government?s decision to ban the import of asbestos roofing materials from Russia effective from 2024.

There are times I am not convinced with CC decisions: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said that there were times when he was not convinced with some decisions taken by the Constitutional Council regarding names sent for the appointments of top posts.
While stressing that he was not going to make any further comment on the matter before all the media cameras, as he did not wish to create a Constitutional clash the following morning.
The President made this remark while addressing the Annual National Meeting of Judicial Officers Association held at the Galadari Hotel on Sunday.
?Everybody knows the power of the President after the 19th Amendment of the Constitution. The Constitutional Council takes the final decisions about the promotions. I always tried my level best to get impartial decisions during my tenure in the last three years. I dedicated myself towards it. When some problems arose, I checked and clarified matters with the Attorney General. I got recommendations from the Chief Justice and the Judicial Services Commission. I did so to avoid any crisis situations. After getting these recommendations I sent the names to the Constitutional Council. There are times that I have not agreed with the constitutional council. Sometimes I agreed with them. I do not like to speak much about it. I think if there is an issue that hampers the promotion of an officer on disciplinary grounds, it is fair that such information is conveyed to me in writing before the recommendation of such names are made to me," the President said.
