Aaron Finch hits highest individual T20 score
	
Australian Aaron Finch has smashed his own record for the highest Twenty20 international score, blasting an astonishing 172 in Australia's tri-series match against Zimbabwe.
The Australian skipper passed his previous mark of 156 in the 18th over, which he set against England in 2013.
Finch continued his rich vein of form on Tuesday as he combined with opening partner D'Arcy Short to put on a 223 stand - the highest partnership in T20I history.
Short was out for 46 with four balls left in the innings at Harare Sports Club, while Finch was dismissed two balls later by hitting his own wicket.
The 31-year-old was only three runs behind West Indian Chris Gayle's highest Twenty20 score of 175, which he hit in the 2013 Indian Premier League.
Australia finished their 20 overs on 2-229, setting Zimbabwe a near impossible target.

## Title: Bandula Nanayakkarawasam : The boy who loved  to read

Bandula Nanayakkarawasam : The boy who loved  to read
	
There was a boy once. He loved to read. He also loved to write. He loved languages and the study of languages, right down to music, literature, indeed the arts in general. But he had chosen Science for A/Levels. Not a problem, until you consider that time spent reading and writing had to be devoted to studying the human body, nuclear science, and those particles that make us the humans we are. Naturally, he struggled. None of this made sense. 
These were times when he would have preferred to return to the books which adorned his and his fathers library, but then his parents, particularly his father, were strict. Besides, there were exams around the corner.
So this boy hit upon a solution. He would read his textbooks, and study them if necessary, but he would at the same time use them as a cover for reading what he wanted to read. So one fine day, having chanced across W.A. de Silvas Vijayaba Kollaya, he hid it under his biology textbook and began devouring it. Certain that no one would see what he was doing, he thus absorbed himself in the antics of 16th century politics and the seemingly endless battles between kings and the love stories and the intrigue that those battles, political or otherwise, bred. So fascinated was he by these romances and the historic processes behind them that he didnt bother to hide the novel anymore. It just lay there, barely concealed by the textbook. What happened next was, naturally then, in many ways to be expected. His father, an irate father if ever there was one, entered the room, took one look at him, went up, and slapped him. You think you can deceive me he shouted at him, Put that book away, at once!
Recounting this many, many decades later, the boy, now a man, stood up before a roomful of boys, most of whom would have chosen Science for their A/Levels, and told them the following: If you want to read and dont have the time to read owing to what you have to study, find if not make the time somehow to explore your library.

He was sent to Richmond College where his teachers, and friends, indulged in his love for literature and music. It was there that he had learnt to gaze critically at what he was reading until then
By this time, needless to say, he had become what he wanted. He had ventured into poetry, literature, languages, and had become a definitive poet and lyricist himself. While lacking proper academic credentials for these fields, he nevertheless had made up for it by his innate sensibilities and ability to pick and choose, to turn experience into veritable drops of poetry, and to extract from the mundane the lyricism that could transform the most banal setting into a set of verses, lines, rhythms, and rhymes.
Like many lyricists from the seventies and eighties, Bandula Nanayakkarawasam came to me early on, particularly through the TV series which featured his songs and in particular through a single that later became a personal favourite (Sina Thotak). No longer the boy who despised science, no longer the boy who believed (at least not completely) in rebellion against fathers and mothers by resorting to deception in order to sustain ones love for literature, Bandula, soft-spoken and yet articulate with what he says and writes, can count on all those anecdotes he now so casually refers to as the foreword, the preface, to his life later on. I will thus begin at the very beginning.
Bandula was born in Galle, about two or three kilometres from town. His love for literature, conditioned at an early age, had actually been preceded by his love for music. Back then there were only two radio channels, both from Radio Ceylon. I happened to be the youngest in the family. I was a bit of a loner. So when I was free, and I was free almost all the time, I would put my ear to the Mullard radio our uncle bought for us and listen to every programme and song with unabated interest. So concerned were my parents and siblings that my loku akka, knowing I thought there were actual human beings who lived inside the speakers, told me during a thunderstorm that if lightning struck, those humans would be struck and the speakers would break apart. I honestly believed her. I would have been five at the time.
Surprisingly, he didnt initially look for the lyric in what he listened to. At one level this was to be expected, after all we first hear a tune, then a voice, and only then a name. The lyricist, for some reason, comes last. But there were fresh winds blowing during Bandulas childhood, which had unearthed the likes of Amaradeva and Victor Ratnayake. Victor was definitely a voice from my time. So was Sanath Nandasiri. It was by listening to them that I got to appreciate the full worth of Amaradeva. No, poetry didnt figure in me much back then. But listening to Victor aiyas songs, and writing down their lyrics, and then turning to Amaradevas songs, made me realise just how complex the whole process of writing songs was. That would have been my first encounter with the fusion of music and literature. In later years, I went beyond them.
Going beyond them meant getting hooked on to literature, a field that his father, a leftist and an avid reader, was passionate about. Apparently young Bandula would get as much as Rs. 100 (quite a lot back then) to buy what he wanted, most of which he purchased from a shop owned by a man called Lionel. In my day, a book cost about Rs. four or five. With Rs. 100, you could buy a roomful. Among the novels he read, those written by Russian authors fascinated him. In later years I grew to admire the poets and novelists who were virtually cast aside by the Soviets. Among them was Alexander Pushkin, whom I still prefer to the more revolutionary writers. When I was young, however, almost everything I read happened to come from Russia, and whether in their original or translation, they projected a certain worldview which shaped me. Most of these books came from Progress Publishers, incidentally.

Certain that no one would see what he was doing, he thus absorbed himself in the antics of 16th century politics and the seemingly endless battles between kings and the love stories and the intrigue that those battles, political or otherwise, bred
He was sent to Richmond College where his teachers, and friends, indulged in his love for literature and music. It was there that he had learnt to gaze critically at what he was reading until then. In particular, one of his English teachers, W.S. Bandara, introduced him to the English translations of Chekhov, Gogol, Dostoyevsky, and Turgenev, which made him realise how carelessly and shoddily some of the Sinhala translations of these writers were done. Those translations were woefully inadequate. For instance, in some passages, the word xam (kham) was rendered as rapist at one extreme and lover at another. It should have been rendered as cad. These were small errors, yes, but they taught me the value of cultivating taste in a language before attempting to translate it to another. Bandara sir was a fan of K.G. Karunathilake, moreover, and he got me to read his translations, because they were the best we had.
Musically too, he prospered. We would organise various concerts. I even took part in several inter-school competitions, many of them pitting us against our rival school, Mahinda College. A chance encounter at Mahinda, curiously, had given him the idea for a song that he would write decades later. Apparently he had been taken to that school along with some other boys for an item they had to perform at its English Day. They had to dramatise a melody. I remember being selected to sit atop the branch of a mango tree, a given since I was thin and quite small for my age then. We happened to tear off that branch on our way. Naturally, we didnt bother checking it, so we didnt notice the army of red, vicious ants that was on it. While I was happily perched, those ants crawled up my leg and started biting me. I reacted. Badly. Soon enough, the entire branch collapsed, though my friends, bless them, continued as though nothing had happened even when I yelled. While the incident has stayed fresh in his mind ever since, he remembers it today more for that melody they had to sing: Where are you going to my pretty maid, which found its way in the sixties to the baila hit Koheda yanne Rukmani and in the eighties to one of my favourite songs written by Nanayakkarawasam, Mal Pipeyi Deneth Areyi, from Amba Yahaluwo.
Back home, he was almost always on the radio. It gradually became an obsession, so much so that he found he couldnt do without it even while studying. A man called Jinasena, a close family friend, therefore lent him some flexible wires, which he then used on an American speaker that belonged to another uncle of his. Our house oversaw a wel yaya. When I listened to the radio in my room while, for instance, studying arithmetic, that wel yaya was always in my sight. It is a sight I cannot forget. Not even now. And it wasnt just songs he listened to, by the way: among the other programmes he patronised there were E.W. Adikarams Vidya Dahanaya, Mahinda Ranaweeras Sithijaya, Lucien Bulathsinhalas Sandella, and the main English series he listened to, Tissa Abeysekaras Art Magazine. To this date, he tells me, he finds it easy to concentrate on something with the radio switched on.

## Title: Beira clean-up  !

Beira clean-up  !
	

The 12 km stretch of Beira banks will be divided into 500 metre slots and cleaned in groups, together with the CMC and experts from Abans and Carekleen. 
	Volunteers are expected to bring with them personal safety items such as gloves.
	No volunteers will be permitted to clean the water of the lake. The drainage division of CMC, the Navy, Ports Authority and SLRDC will continue to clean the waters of Beira. 

Colombos iconicBeira Lake has long provided travellers and locals alike, a moments refuge away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Although tranquil at sight, the central water body is also known for its seasonal stench. The putrescent green waters paired with the littered banks constantly remind passers by, that disposal of garbage is still a problem encountered by this rapidlydeveloping city.
The Guardians of the City: The No Kunu Team is preparing to help rid Beira Lake of the mounting litter on its banks. Founder of the No Kunu Initiative, Retired Engineer and activist for sustainable solutions, Sumi Moonesinghe spoke to the on why such constant efforts are the need of the hour.


CMC performance impressive 
The No Kunu Initiative began with the team visiting slums and the tenements of the city of Colombo, where they taught the ordinary city dwellers to segregate their garbage. As you know, the Kerawalapitiya garbage disposal site will not accept any unsegregated waste. The Colombo Municipal Council only collects segregated waste. Clear and precise notices have been displayed to inform residents of when the garbage trucks arrive to collect which type of the garbage. The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) has therefore done a commendable job. Come rain, sunshine or even floods, they have continued to collect garbage while maintaining the citys cleanliness, Moonesinghe said. 
She believes however that such efforts are often disregarded. This is a thankless job. Nobody appreciates what they are doing for the city. People only complain of garbage dumps and lament that the city is unclean, she said. However, it is no secret that a handful of short-sighted individuals in the community are littering the streets with bags of unsegregated garbage. I suspect that such people have the luxuries of travelling by vehicles, but still opt to dump their garbage on the streets away from their home. In fact we have footage of a lady who issues parking tickets in Colombo speaking of what she has witnessed. As she is regularly on street duty, she has seen a number of people travelling in vehicles, throwing bags of garbage on to the road and taking off. Unfortunately we dont have a system of fining, or any other deterrent to stop people from doing this! she said. 
The No Kunu Teams initial efforts were no mean feat. The team decided to start with the tenements as they felt that this group were in need of their assistance. We started by giving residents of these areas a bucket with the lid and handle along with a polysac bag to segregate the garbage. Food waste goes into one and the other one takes the recyclable garbage, Moonesinghe detailed. This effort has been very successful as we have already covered about 2,000 shanties. We have covered many areas including Layards Broadway, Wanathamulla and Vithanage mw just to name a few, she said. 
Gradual effort 
On World Environment Day which fell on June 5, the No Kunu Team with the support of the CMC and the Chief Incumbent of the Gangarama Temple Ven. Galaboda Gnanissara thera, cleaned Muttiah Park in Slave Island. This was shortly after a trial run polythene bag-free shopping experience at the Staple Street Cargills Food City outlet. Moonesinghe notes that all three major supermarket chains in the country, including Cargills, Keells and Arpico, are working towards providing customers with a polythene-free shopping experience at their respective outlets island-wide. 
To accelerate this process, the No Kunu Team has also started issuing an eco-friendly reusable cloth bag to residents of Colombos tenements. The green bag which comes with a convenient pouch fold is easily fitted into a pocket or bag. The Team advises never to leave home without it. Our team has already called upon all FMCG companies to consider giving a free cloth bag through their promotional activities. We have also called upon the telecommunication companies, banks, utility services etc. to switch to electronic statements and billing. This way we save paper which adds to garbage, explained the founder of the initiative. She added that corporates were also urged to suspend the printing of calendars and diaries and invest in more eco-friendly solutions. We have reached out to the entire country through these companies and their branch networks. If they all respond to the No Kunu Teams requests, it would be the start of a very successful movement to rid Sri Lanka of garbage, she added. 

Sangakkara volunteered to do a video clip calling upon all citizens to take the No Kunu pledge and to keep our country clean
The No Kunu Initiative relies heavily on social media to raise awareness for this cause. The project shot to public attention following a viral video featuring Sri Lankas beloved cricket icon Kumar Sangakkara urging Sri Lankans to keep Sri Lanka clean. 


Sangakkara volunteered to do a video clip calling upon all citizens to take the No Kunu pledge and to keep our country clean. This is a very powerful message which helped us gain much attention, Moonesinghe said. It was however not a single-handed effort according to the founder. There were many people who helped the No Kunu Team to get this video done, from the storyboard, recording and until the final production. We are very grateful to all those who helped us to get Sangakkara aboard on this project and to take the message to our citizens across Sri Lanka, she said. 

Our team has already called upon all FMCG companies to consider giving a free cloth bag through their promotional activities. We have also called upon the telecommunication companies, banks, utility services etc. to switch to electronic statements and billing
The littered banks of Beira (L) are already being cleaned by the the No Kunu Team prior to the July 21 project

Cleaning up Beira 
Even with rising awareness and encouraging responses, the No Kunu Teams mission is far from complete.
The team will come together once again to clean the banks of Beira Lake on July 21. 
The 11.2 km Beira lake has been divided into half kilometre stretches or blocks for this purpose. A list of corporates, schools and other stakeholders have been prepared to take up the task. We are calling upon all these institutions to respond to our call to volunteer and clean the perimeter of their premises on the banks of Beira, Moonesinghe explained. 
Asked of the feedback regarding this project, Moonesinghe beamed that the response has been tremendous. The Beira Lake cleaning project has been announced on No Kunu Facebook page. Various organisations from all around the country have joined hands with us to volunteer on that day, she said. 
The Beira Lake is owned by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority while only the Navy and the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLRDC) are the only authorities permitted to clean the waters of the Beira lake. Moonesinghe revealed that the regular cleaning of the water body is a costly exercise. 

Volunteers are kindly requested to wear appropriate clothing as suggested in the above image and bring with them personal safety items such as gloves

Many parts of Colombo are owned and maintained by various institutions and their responsibilities are bifurcated. For instance the beautiful arcade at Torrington square and the walking track are owned and maintained by the Urban Developent Authority (UDA), while the Galle Face Green is owned and maintained by the Ports Authority. Meanwhile there are many Government owned low cost housing schemes under the UDA and National Housing Development Authority. Because of this bifurcated nature in responsibilities, it is imperative for one person to co-ordinate this operation, said Moonesinghe explaining the need for a figure of authority in steering the project forward. This need led to our decision to request the Ven. Galaboda Gnanissara Thera (fondly known as Podi Hamuduruwo of Gangaramaya Temple) to oversee co-ordination of this project. Podi Hamuduruwo has lived on the banks of the Beira during the past 60 years, hence he is the most suited to steer this project, she explained. 
A meeting chaired by Ven. Galaboda Gnanissara Thera to discuss the cleaning of the waters of Beira and led by the Navy Commander is scheduled to be held at the temple premises on July 5. 
Were launching this campaign from the Seema Malaka at 8 am on July 21 with Podi Hamuduruwo, the Mayor Rosy Senanayake, Navy Commander, Chairman of the Ports Authority together with many more government officials and volunteers. The CMC teams will arrive at their designated stations within the 500 metre stretches at 8 am and assist the clean up operation by the residents, Moonesinghe said. 

This need led to our decision to request the Ven. Galaboda Gnanissara Thera (fondly known as Podi Hamuduruwo of Gangaramaya Temple) to oversee coordination of this project. Podi Hamuduruwo has lived on the banks of the Beira during the past 60 years
The founder of the No Kunu Initiative did not hesitate to add that garbage and its proper disposal were a responsibility of every citizen in the country, including corporates. What we expect from the corporates is for them to come forward with volunteers on this day to clean the banks. Come with large polysacs, rakes, mammoties, wheel barrows etc. to clean up the perimeter of your respective premises.  she urged. 
The No Kunu Team calls upon the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media, the Department of Inland Revenue, the National Housing Development Authority, the Peoples Bank branches on Sir Chittampalam A Gardiner Mawatha and Kew Road, The Associated Newspapers of Ceylon, the Ministry of Transport, Sri Lanka Railways, Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the State Trading Corporation, the Air Force, Army Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Regiment, the Ports Authority, State Engineering Corporation and Bank of Ceylon to participate in this massive peoples initiative of cleaning the banks of The Beira Lake.

Belgiums last-minute goal shocks Japan
	
For a moment, it looked to be the greatest game in Japanese soccer history. Up 2-0 against Belgium, Japan was looking at a first ever trip to the World Cup quarterfinals.
But Belgium unleashed its world-class quality and ripped off three straight goals, the last coming in the dying seconds of regulation, to crush Japans hopes on Monday in Rostov-on-Don.
In the fourth minute of added time, Belgium went on a 4-on-3 break, led by Thomas Meunier, who slid the ball across to Romelu Lukaku, who was frustrated all game. Instead of shooting, Lukaku faked and let the ball go clear to Nacer Chadli, who punched in the winning goal and set off a wild celebration in the stadium and across Belgium
The victory avoided a demoralizing defeat for Belgiums so-called Golden Generation of players that has long promised a great performance at a major championship and now seems poised to deliver it, at least if it can get past mighty Brazil in the quarterfinal on Friday.
Belgium dominated the first half, but was frustrated time and again by Japans pesky defense, which always seemed to be in the right place to clear a pass or block a shot.
But it was Japan that improbably jumped on the scoreboard three minutes into the second half. Jan Vertonghen badly missed a back pass, giving Genki Haraguchi a chance through on goal. He finished clinically, and Japan was in front.
While the first goal came after an error, the second, four minutes later, was pure class. Japan passed the ball around with some skill, and it eventually found Takashi Inui at the top of the box. It didnt look like a golden chance, but he turned and rifled it into the net.
For 17 minutes, fans were contemplating a dramatic upset. But thats when the fightback began. Vertonghen was far along the end line, but somehow headed it in from an impossible angle and distance.
Five minutes later, Belgium was on level terms. Substitute Marouane Felliani leaped the highest for Eden Hazards inch-perfect cross and headed it home.
To Japans credit, it did not back off and kept looking for a goal. But it was favored Belgium who finished off the game 94 minutes in. It was a comeback to remember for Belgium and a heartbreaking end to Japans nearly-famous day.(NYTimes)

Breakdown in rule of law allows Maheswaran to make such statements: JVP
	
The government has created an environment, which is used by people to make various statements similar to the one made by State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran, who had called for the re-organization of the LTTE, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.
JVP MP and Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath told a media conference today that the breaking down of the rule of law had left room for Ms. Maheswaran to make such a statement and for some others to call for a Hitler-like administrator.
He said it was the government which was responsible for the breakdown of rule of law. The Government has to take the responsibility for the statement made by Ms. Maheswaran as it is the government which had allowed the rule of law to breakdown, the MP said.
He said Ms. Maheswaran should be asked to apologise to the nation. Because her statement is against the State, he said.
The MP said the statement was made at a State function in the presence of two ministers -- the two in charge of external and internal affairs and therefore the government should make an official statement on this matter.
He said Ms. Maheswarans claim that the abduction of children and killings never took place during the LTTE era cannot be accepted as former combatants Karuna Amman and Pillayan had also harassed children during the war by forcibly engaging them in hostilities.
The MP said these two people were given government posts some years ago. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Dopers and drug traffickers are his supporters
	

A powerful politico ruling the roost in an area hallowed by the Buddhas visit has become a guardian angel of dope-fiends and dope peddlers there, they say.

This worthy who took to politics following a career that gave him the appellation, hero, has become a veritable nuisance to the law-enforcing ones.
The area the politico looks on as his domain is said to be fast turning into a hotbed of crime and drug trafficking and he has become a stumbling block to carrying out a cleansing operation by the arms of the law.
Whenever a doper or a trafficker is arrested, the politico would phone up some khakied high-up and order that the chap be immediately released. He would not stop at using his clout to get the miscreants released; he would even blame us for deliberately harassing his active supporters! a khakied source said.

Even garbage can be imported through FTA with Singapore: JO
	
The Joint Opposition (JO) today said the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed with Singapore had enabled the import of waste materials released by municipal councils and medical facilities of other countries to Sri Lanka.
JO MP Bandula Gunawardana said the FTA has listed a number of waste materials categorized by the Harmonised System (HS) Code, which can be imported to Sri Lanka.
Waste pharmaceuticals, sewage sludge and residual products of the chemical or allied industries are some of the waste materials which can be imported to the country in order to generate electricity and to use for other purposes, he told a news conference.
He said a certain individual in Sri Lanka has already made preparations to bring down mountains of foreign garbage, 40 times the size of waste materials in the country, to be placed at Aruwakkalu landfill site in Puttalam.
He reiterated that the FTA has been signed without the approval of the President and the Cabinet.
The President in a Cabinet Memorandum said any foreign agreement should be prepared in accordance with the National Trade Policy. However, the Singapore FTA has been finalised based on a New Trade Policy, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

FIFA and more: Why 2018 is a victory year for Putin
	
Russias victory over 2010 world champion Spain on Sunday was only icing on the cake for Russian leader Vladimir Putin. With the much-hyped Donald Trump and Putin meeting now scheduled for July 16 in Helsinki, the day after the curtain closer of FIFA, the Russian leader will meet his US counterpart as one who has regained the lost glory of Russia as a sporting nation. 
Putin had reportedly called Russian coach Stanislav Cherchesov hours before the match with Spain and wished the team the best. Putin had also apparently said the Russian people would respect the team for what it had already achieved regardless of the outcome of the match against Spain, a FIFA favourite.

Notwithstanding his words, there was little doubt that Putin badly wanted his team to win the match and must surely have been jubilant when it made to the quarter-finals; largely thanks to the stunning saves by Russian captain cum goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev. After all, Spain is one of the eight national teams to have won the FIFA world cup and had been back-to-back European champions.
However, one may say Russias greatest victory in the game against Spain came on December 2, 2010 -- the moment it beat a combined bid by Spainand Ronaldos Portugal to host 2018 FIFA. Russia won 13 of the 22 FIFA Executive Committee votes while Spain-Portugal combine got only 7 votes. The hot favourites to win this years trophy, Belgium too had made a big bid along with good neighbour, the Netherlands. However, they could muster only two votes from the committee.
With 12 venues allocated for 65 matches and all going according to schedule, Russia no doubt has proven that it is once again in the league of the nations that is resourceful enough to host any global event.
Incidentally, Luzhniki stadium -- the venue of the FIFA 2018 first match and also where the finals are slated to take place -- was the main stadium of the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games.
So it appears the glorious days are back and lady luck is once again shining on Russia with a larger section of the global community embracing the former socialist State, however much a section of the West is trying to vilify it as an outcast.
Politically too, the Russian days cannot be more anymore upbeat. Its role in the Syrian war has made its clout as the ace global political gambler more perceptible than ever.
While Trump is already on record that he would refer to Russian meddling in the US election, during the Helsinki summit, the most crucial item on table during the talks is likely to be an announcement of a US plan to withdraw some 2,000 US troops from Syria. For this, Trump needs an assurance from the Russian leader that his country would not attack the US-supported troops near the Jordan border in southwest Syria. With pro-Assad forces pounding the area, a truce would allow the UStroops some breathing space to withdraw.
In return of this favour, Trump is slated to avoid making any stumbling blocks to the Russian plan to consolidate Syrian President Bashar alAssad. The move has already been condemned by US critics as a sellout; a US handing over a global victory for Putin. A victory for sure, that would be for Putin, if an unstable Trump washes his hands off the Syrian mess, for which he too has his own reasons cite.

Fmr Malaysian PM Najib Razak arrested for corruption
	
Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak was arrested by anti-corruption investigators on Tuesday afternoon in a development likely to lead to the former leader's charging with corruption offences.
A source with knowledge of the inquiry into Najib said that investigators had arranged for the former PM to hand himself into the anti-corruption agency on Tuesday.
Last month, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said authorities were seeking to bring embezzlement and bribery charges against Najib after an inquiry into the suspected theft of billions of dollars from the state-run fund 1MDB.
US Department of Justice civil lawsuits are seeking to seize $US1.7 billion in real estate, art works and other luxuries allegedly bought with money looted from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) state fund, over which Najib exercised significant control.(Sydney Morning Herald)

Chairman, Mr. Susantha Rathnayake addressing the gathering at Volunteer Recognition Day 2018
The John Keells Group felicitated high performing volunteers contributing to CSR initiatives of 2017/18 at its annual Volunteer Recognition Day held on 21st June 2018 at Cinnamon Lakeside.
Staff volunteerism is at the heart of the John Keells Groups community engagement strategy. Most projects carried out by John Keells Foundation (Foundation) - the CSR entity of the Group - function with the support of volunteers. The Groups volunteer network enables employees to go beyond their day-to-day work and make a hands-on contribution to community and environment development while the volunteer leave policy facilitates the release of staff for CSR activities with minimum restraint. Volunteers vary from project champions, trainers and trained assistants to those who engage in skill-based volunteerism and administrative support.
During 2017/18, 840 staff volunteers engaged in projects undertaken by the Foundation recording 1398 volunteer instances accounting for 5411 hours, excluding CSR initiatives organized at a sector or business level.

Every year volunteers are recognized for their commitment and contribution with Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze or `Merit ratings based on the Foundations Volunteer Rating Mechanism with the high performers being awarded at the annual Volunteer Recognition Day. Commenting on volunteerism at John Keells, Muditha Senarath-Yapa, Head of John Keells Research who champions the Foundations Science Promotion project and was a `gold recipient at the event, said, As a volunteer, my greatest fulfilment was in observing children from rural areas learning to code a small robot to do simple tasks. It clearly shows that Sri Lanka is a country of very talented people. The day we learn to harness this potential is the day we change this country.
The Volunteer Recognition Day 2018 was graced by Chairman and Directors of the John Keells Group. Speaking at the event, Mr. Susantha Ratnayake, Chairman, John Keells Holdings PLC (JKH) stated, I take this opportunity to thank you profusely for the amazing passion and commitment that you continue to show.

Kannadi Kapuwa flees village after scam exposed
	
A middle aged man who had no permanent employment had left his village and worked as a helper of a Light Reader (penakaru) of a devalaya in a distant village. He was entrusted with odd jobs but was barred from handling money that came as offerings to the devalaya. After some time, this man decided to start his own devalaya and came to back to his village with the required items like photographs of deities, bells etc. He opened a devalaya next to his house. The fragrance emanating from the lighting of incense sticks made people fall prey to his approach and soon people started flocking to his devalaya seeking relief or awareness on various issues.
Generally he positions himself facing the back to those present.
One day while in his usual trance, he had uttered that a Buddhist monk would come there in a short while. Within minutes a Buddhist monk walked in much to the surprise of the people gathered there. However, one suspicious man in the gathering had gone out and peeped into the area where the kapuwa was performing and found that he had placed a small mirror through which he could see anyone entering his devalaya.
From that day onwards, he was known as a Kannadi (mirror) Kapuwa and soon he had to run away from the village for the second time.

## Title: Maldivian Presidential election is no longer a  one horse race

Maldivian Presidential election is no longer a  one horse race
	
Ibrahim Mohamed Solih alias Ibu

The opposition parties in the Maldives are rallying round Ibrahim Mohamed Solih alias Ibu, who was elected last Saturday as the candidate of the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) for the September 23 Presidential election.
With the opposition pledging unreserved support to Solih, the landmark Presidential election, being held after a period of great national and international turmoil, will not be a one horse race with incumbent President Abdulla Yameen smoothly sailing into his second term.
The opposition, which had formed the Reform Alliance to defeat Yameen in the election and also to carry out much needed reforms to accord with the letter and spirit of the 2008 democratic Constitution, has also agreed to accept a running mate put up by the Jumhoory Party (JP).
The running mate is the Vice Presidential candidate and he or she has to be formally nominated by every person standing for the post of President.
The JP is yet to select a running mate though the front runner for the place is JP Supremos wife Aishath Nahula.
In his speech at the MDP Convention, Presidential candidate Solih pledged to ensure justice, repair relations with neighbours (presumably India), and to free the security forces from political influences.
As a lawmaker for 25 years, Solih said he had worked daily with people who held opposing views. Solih, who is now MDP parliamentary group leader, was first elected to Parliament to represent Lhaviyani atoll in 1994. Opposition parties must compromise and work together for change, as the country needs a moment of peace, he said. He urged MDP to invite coalition partners to propose changes to the MDP manifesto without compromising its essence.
One of the key elements of the MDP manifesto is to first form a coalition government of all opposition parties for a period of 18 months and then hold a fresh Presidential election in which the various parties will contest separately.
During the 18 months of coalition rule, the government will carry out democratic reforms. It will dismantle the authoritarian structures and practices characteristic of the Yameen regime. One of the key reforms will be to remove the ban on fighting elections slapped on former President Mohamed Nasheed and Jumhoory Party leader Gasim Ibrahim. They would be able to contest in the second Presidential election to be held 18 months after the first one in September 2018.
Solih pledged to be a man of the people, and added: I assure you that I will not be a slave to anyone. Currently leader of the MDP in Parliament, Solih has been in politics for 25 years. He got into Parliament first, way back in 1994. He has not been charged with any crime and put in jail for long, unlike so many others in his party and other opposition parties.
He was arrested in March during a protest against the declaration of a State of Emergency on February 5, but was released after nine days. However, he continued the agitation against Yameen by leading the boycott of Parliament, which has been effective till date.
Unlike self-exiled MDP Supremo and former President Mohamed Nasheed, Solih is not a controversial or abrasive figure. He gets along with others and liked by all, including the leaders of the ruling Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM).
PPM leaders have always considered Solih a better candidate than Nasheed because it will be easy to work with him if he rather than Nasheed, is in charge of the MDP and the opposition.
This is the reason why the Fisheries Minister and PPM leader in charge of negotiating with the opposition parties, Dr. Mohamed Shainee, said Solihs nomination augurs well for resuming all-party talks on ironing out issues between the Yameen government and the opposition.
Solihs nomination is a step towards reconciliation, Shainee said on Sunday, as he went on to appeal to the joint opposition candidate to help resume the stalled all-party talks to resolve outstanding issues and ensure a free and fair election.
The all-party talks had been stalled because the government and the opposition could not find any middle ground. The government said convicted and jailed opposition leaders could not be released arbitrarily but the opposition parties had made unconditional release a precondition for talks. Not all in the ruling PPM believe that the ghost of Nasheed has been laid. PPM Deputy Leader Abdul Raheem Abdulla told the media on Sunday that Solihs sole job as President would be to pave the way for Nasheeds return as President after 18 months.
The MDPs manifesto, to be ratified by other opposition parties, says that a coalition government will be formed after the September 23 elections, and 18 months later, a fresh Presidential election will be held in which parties can contest independently. With the ban on jailed leaders having been removed by the coalition government, Nasheed and others, who are now barred from contesting, will be able to contest.

Nasheeds candidature and withdrawal
The importance of the MDP congress was underscored after a decision by self-exiled former President Mohamed Nasheed to withdraw from the Presidential race. Though hugely popular, Nasheeds candidacy had been in serious doubt because of his conviction for 13 years on counts relating to terrorism. However, regardless of the official ban, Nasheed had contested and won the party primary to secure the MDP Presidential ticket. Not unexpectedly, the nomination was rejected by the Elections Commission.
His bid to stand threatened to end efforts to bring about opposition unity which many thought was absolutely necessary to defeat an entrenched President like Abdulla Yameen. To complicate matters, Gasim Ibrahim of the Jumhoory Party also threw in his hat in the ring and even announced his future Cabinet.
It was when all hope of putting up a joint opposition was lost that someone or some forces prevailed upon Nasheed to back out.

Prospects
The joint opposition comprising the MDP, the JP, the Islamist Adhaalath Party and former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom now have a 50:50 chance of defeating President Yameen.
The MDP and the rest of the opposition rate their chances as being very high, but the PPM has predicted a 52% votes for itself.
The contest will essentially be between Yameens development oriented but authoritarian policies and the oppositions plea for the restoration of democracy.
It will be between the value of participating in the existing Constitutional institutions like Parliament and boycotting them to make them unworkable and their decisions seem to be illegitimate.
It will be a choice between engaging opponents and opting out of engagements in favour of confrontation from set positions. It will be a choice between sticking to the rules and laws enacted by Parliament and seeking extra-parliamentary and extra-constitutional solutions. Lastly, it will be a contest between settling matters within the country and getting foreign help both political and military, to do so.

Mobitel partners THURUs intriguing digital reforestation innovation startup
	
Launch of Mobitel Partnership with THURU at the Kotiyak Vatina Adahasak Season 2 with; (from left) Hasanka Padukka  Co-founder, Thuru (Kotiyak Vatina Adahasak Season 2 contestant), Mahela Jayawardena  Former Captain, Sri Lanka Cricket and Brand Ambassador, Mobitel and Prabhath Gamage  General Manager, Enterprise Business, Mobitel.
Glimpsing joint synergies and strong potential for collaboration, Mobitel is poised to work together with THURU, one of the 10 finalists of the Season 2 of Kotiyak Vatina Adahasak, Sri Lankas first-ever innovation and entrepreneurship based tech reality TV show powered by Mobitel. Mobitel conceptualized this programme, which was produced and aired on Sirasa TV. Mobitel and Thuru will work in collaboration with each other to take THURU to the next level through co-creation and co-innovation. THURU is a digital inclusion reforestation drive initiated from Sri Lanka with a mission to plant 2 million trees by end 2020. As the technology partner for THURU, Mobitel will provide technical consultation to the THURU team, mainly in the domains of NBIoT (Narrow Band Internet-of-Things), Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence to make the system futuristic and intelligent. As the National Mobile Service Provider, Mobitel has taken on the mantle of a mentor to nurture tech entrepreneurs and innovative startups that can succeed as successful businesses. Through this collaboration, Mobitel plans to conduct a reforestation drive targeting the entire country and will reveal the details in the near future.
THURU holds the potential to be introduced as a gamified platform for planting trees, where the process is driven through a mobile app, which is called facebook for trees. People can plant trees and upload images, details and the app will automatically generate points, and the person can climb up in the leaderboard as a true nature hero. The app will automatically count the oxygen output based on the type of plant and number of months/years of the tree. The longer the person takes care of the tree and uploads images, the more points he gets. It will be a guide to tree planting and will help users link up with like-minded nature lovers and tree huggers across the globe. THURU also carries out a reforestation/planting project around the country. Interestingly, they are always introducing technology into the process with initiatives such as using drones to successfully reforest a large area within a short period despite the difficult terrain
Mobitel, under its credo, We Care. Always, is focused on environmental and social responsibility initiatives and this collaboration provides an ideal balance of both technology and greening, while engaging the larger community to become conscious of the need to reforest Sri Lanka for future generations. Mobitel is continuously supporting and encouraging tech entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka, through many initiatives, to offer encouragement for innovators.

MR can contact editors if takes issue with our reporting: NY Times
	
The New York Times newspaper today said it has encouraged former president Mahinda Rajapaksa to contact senior editors at New York Times if he takes issue with Times reporting.
If Mr. Rajapaksa takes issue with Times reporting, we have encouraged him to contact senior editors at The New York Times rather than intimidating Sri Lankan journalists, Times International Editor Michael Slackmansaid in a statement. 
He said agroup of Sri Lankan parliamentarians allied with former president Rajapaksa, held a news conference to publicly criticize two journalists who contributed logistical assistance to a rigorously reported and accurate New York Times investigation into the Hambantota port, published on June 26.
It is unacceptable for journalists to be intimidated in this way. This action appears intended to silence critics and curb press freedoms, and ultimately deprive Sri Lankans of information in the public interest.
The Times expects the Sri Lankan authorities to ensure the safety of journalists working for our or anyothernews organization, Mr. Slackmansaid.

Joint opposition MP Namal Rajapaksa today asked New York Times (NYT) International Editor Michael Slackman to specify which Sri Lankan MP they accused of having intimidated journalists.
The NYT said in a statement that a group of Sri Lankan MPs allied with former president Mahinda Rajapaksa had publicly criticized two journalists who contributed to the New York Times investigation into the Hambantota Port.
When and where did this occur These types of unspecified, vague accusations are exactly what we have a problem with. At no time did former president Rajapaksa or myself intimidate journalists who worked on this article. Just like the media has a right to criticize politicians, don't we also have the right to "publicly criticize" reporting we believe to be faulty, he said in a tweet.
Mr. Rajapaksa said this wasn't the first time that the NYT got a story significantly wrong because of anonymous sources.

  New Constitution is unimaginable now  
	
Tamils opposed to Gota in general as possible candidate
Northern people wont vote en bloc to a particular candidate at next Presidential Polls
Yet, there are some Tamils who admire him as a doer
People in the North are not in favour of separatism or another armed struggle
C. V. Wigneswaran is quite popular among people
We dont get international support and sympathy as it used to be

Jaffna District Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Parliamentarian Dharmalingam Siddharthan speaks to Daily Mirror about politics in the North and the presidential elections. Mr. Siddharthan, who is the leader Peoples Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), says people in the North will not vote en bloc to a particular candidate at the next election. The Excerpt:-
QAs far as the TNA is concerned, how do you assess the political situation of the country
I do not know what does TNA leader R. Sampanthan feels. From the TNAs point of view, I personally feel the partys main purpose is Constitutional Reforms. It is not going to happen, though. I dont believe it would happen. 
QWhy do you think so
The two main constituent parties of the government - the SLFP and the UNP - are embroiled in problems and at loggerheads with each other. They cannot be together and take the constitutional process forward. Secondly, I never thought that the Constitution-making process would go on for long. Most southern politicians are basically against the concept of power devolution. They do not believe in devolution. The Constitution-making process is too late now. The government should have done it during its first year in power. Now, the opposition is becoming much stronger. Southern leaders hinder the Constitution-making process. 
QThe TNA played a pivotal role in the installation of this government; particularly at the Presidential Election in 2015. How do you assess present predicament
Tamils were so anti-Mahinda Rajapaksa at that time. That factor played a big role in using their franchise en bloc to the current President. The TNA announced its support to the President only after postal voting took place at that election. Let alone, the 80% of postal voters had cast their ballots in favour of the incumbent President. That shows how Tamil people wanted to see a change even before the TNA took its official stand. After the elections, these two main parties got together. Then, we also thought that it might be possible to have a political solution. In the past, when one party tried to solve the problem, the other opposed to it. The 19th Amendment was enacted comfortably in Parliament this time, giving hope for us. In the immediate aftermath of the elections, Mahinda Rajapaksa was politically very weak. Now, he is strong. Any southern leader does not want to lose his vote base among the Sinhala people. Under these circumstances, it is very difficult to get the new Constitution enacted. 

The political solution is a must for our people. At the same time, people see that their day-to-day problems are not solved. These issues can be solved by the government very easily. But, they have done nothing. That is what the people feel

QAt the last local government elections, the TNA vote base had dropped drastically. Alongside, the vote base of the parties opposed to the TNA had increased. How do you look at the trend
It is a fact that the TNA lost a large proportion of votes. I really do not know whether it is a temporary phenomenon or not. The vote base of the party led by former MP Gajendra Kumar Ponnambalam increased. The people have voted for the governing parties in the centre. The UNP and the SLFP also gained in the north this time. Also, the EPDP led by MP Douglas Devananda got a large number of votes. The political solution is a must for our people. At the same time, people see that their day-to-day problems are not solved. These issues can be solved by the government very easily. But, they have done nothing. That is what people feel. Nevertheless, the government has done something for them actually in terms of the release of lands etc. There are only 130 political prisoners remaining now. They include the convicted ones. Only 70 and 80 people are held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. For people, it is still below their expectations. 

QHow do you look at the provincial council elections due this year
Some ITAK members say Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran will not be the candidate next time. The TNA has not decided who should be the candidate. ITAK people feel that MP Mavai Senathirajah should be the candidate. Mr. Wigneswaran is quite popular among the people. He still never has said he would be leaving the TNA. The TNA has to decide. MP Mavai Senathirajah is adamant that he should be the candidate. 
QAs the leader of PLOTE aligned with the TNA, what is your view
I have not decided as such. At the last provincial council election, I am the one who proposed that Mr. Senathirajah should be the candidate. Yet, Mr. Sampanthan managed to convince the others that it should be Mr. Wigneswaran. He contested accordingly. 
Today, the situation is different. Mr. Wigneswaran is popular. The TNA vote base dwindled. 

QThe extremist parties such as Gajendrakumar Ponnambalams All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) gained at this election. Does it mean that the separatist ideology is gaining ground again
Nobody is talking about separatism. Even Mr. Ponnambalam does not talk about it openly. There are some people living abroad, who make such noise. As far as I am concerned, people living in the North are not in favour of separatism or another armed struggle. They are not ready to lose anymore. They feel enough is enough. They need a political solution and economic development. 

At the last provincial council election, I am the one who proposed that Maavai Senathirajah should be the candidate. Yet, Mr. Sampanthan managed to convince the others that it should be C. V. Wigneswaran
QBut the Tamil Diaspora groups think otherwise...
Some of them think so. There are some others who are rational. They feel that people should not be made a scapegoat any longer to pursue separatist agenda. War is needed for some people to do their businesses. Most expatriate people are not supportive of Tamil Eelam. I met a larger number of expatriate LTTEers. They are now very sober. They could not achieve Eelam even through the armed struggle waged by the LTTE. I do not think anybody can build an outfit like the LTTE. There is no way it can happen. 

QHow influential is the Tamil Diaspora in northern politics
They have a certain degree of influence because of their financial power. Some of them have their intellectual capacity as well. I do not deny that. I dont think their influence is powerful enough to change the policies of the parties operating here. 

QThere was large participation in the Mullivaikkal remembrance events in the North this time. Some chanted separatist slogans. It is interpreted in the South as signs of radicalization. How do you assess this situation
That is the problem. Everyone has to remember his kith and kin. In the history of Sri Lanka,Mullivaikkal is the place where a large number of people had been killed. I also participated in these events because I feel for people. When one joins a military organization, he/she knows that he/she is bound to shed his/her life. But, ordinary people are not like that. They are innocent. That was why I went. Unfortunately, it was exaggerated in the South.

QYet, it is the area where the LTTE was decimated along with its top-rung leaders including Velupillai Prabhakaran. In the South, it is seen as a heroic act. How do you see this
It is natural. In the South, former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the former Army Commander were seen as heroes. MR and Gotabhaya were seen as heroes who finished the war, an act considered impossible for 30 years. It was the other way round in the north. Tamils believe that Prabhakaran fought a valiant war. It does not mean that people are ready to go for Eelam now. I spoke to several ex-LTTE combatants. They were not ready for it. 

QThere are some names being mentioned about the next Presidential Candidate. How do you see it in the North
I dont think people are worried about the Presidential polls. We just wait to see who would be the candidate next time. First, we have to know the candidate. 

QLast time, TNA supported President Maithripala Sirisena. It was speculated that Gotabhaya would be the candidate. In your view, what are the reactions of Tamil people
I think the Tamil people are opposed to him in general. That is because he was the one who fought war and defeated the LTTE. That is the feeling. Actually, it is the truth. I do not know who would the next candidate be. But, some sections of the Tamil people feel that he is better than others though he fought the war. That feeling is there among some Tamils because they have seen the city development in Colombo under him at that time. There is anger against him as well. 
Whoever is fielded, the vote base in the North and the East will be divided. They will not vote en bloc to one candidate. That is what I see. 

QHow do you see the dynamics in the international arena
The attitudes of the international community have changed towards Sri Lanka. We do not now have the kind of sympathy and support we had earlier. As far as we are concerned, India is more important than any other country. 


Nobody is talking about separatism. Even Mr. Ponnambalam does not talk about it openly. There are some people living abroad, who make such noises. As far as I am concerned, people living in the North are not in favour of separatism or another armed struggle

QIf you refer to India, Jayalalithaa was a towering figure as the CM of Tamil Nadu. She used to exert a lot of pressure on the central government of India to prevail upon Sri Lanka. She is no more now. How do you see the situation as a result
Tamil Nadu politics is weak. The support for the cause of Sri Lankan Tamils is on the wane. Earlier, a lot of leaders were there - M.G.Ramachandran, M. Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa. If the state government is not strong enough in Tamil Nadu, the centre does not listen.

Our people are unhappy with govt.: TNA
	
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) today said that their' people were unhappy and that while they had contributed substantially to bring this government to power the government has shown very little progress in the past.
Leader of the Opposition and the TNA R. Sampanthan expressed these views when United Nations Resident Coordinator for Sri Lanka Terence D. Jones paid a courtesy call on him in Parliament.
"Our young people are being discriminated against in many matters, especially with regard to employment opportunities. Our people are suffering continually. This government accepted the need for certain things to be done and they must take the necessary steps to address those needs, he said.
Raising his concerns on the implementation of the UNHRC resolution, Mr. Sampanthan said many aspects of the resolution are not being properly addressed. Not only did the Government of Sri Lanka co-sponsor the resolution, but it requested for more time to implement the resolution and the International community graciously granted that request. Therefore, the government cannot go back on their commitments now.
Mr Sampanthan also highlighted the importance of adopting a new Constitution which will ensure the non-recurrence of the events of the past, which is also a crucial matter stipulated in the UNHRC resolution.
There had been a lot of work done with regard to this matter since 1988. What we need now is the political will and the courage to take it further. We will remain committed to this process and will continue to exert pressure on the government to fulfil its commitments to both its own people and to the international community, he said.
Mr Sampanthan also raised his concerns over the slowness of the process of releasing lands in the North and East.We dont want the military to run farms on our lands which they are doing now, we want them to exit from these commercial activities which hinder the livelihoods of our people, he said.
Speaking further, he said when the government overreact to the extremists it only becomes an impediment to achieving reconciliation.
Speaking on the issue of accountability Mr. Sampanthan said, we dont want the entire military to be framed as criminals, but certainly those who committed grave atrocities must be punished, he said.
The UN Resident Coordinator had in turn assured Mr. Sampanthan that despite the withdrawal of the US from the UNHRC council the concerns of the international community with regards to the implementation of the resolution signed by Sri Lanka remains unchanged.

Private Sector Tourism Skills Committee (TSC) launched to facilitate skills supply in the tourism se
	
Actively seeking to fulfill a timely requirement, Private Sector Tourism Skills Committee (TSC) launched Tourism Workforce Competitiveness Roadmap in collaboration with the private tourism industry to take on the challenge of demonstrating to Sri Lankas young women and men that a career in the fast-growing tourism and hospitality industry can be safe, stimulating, well-compensated and full of opportunities for growth. Formulated under special request from TVEC and the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training to urgently respond to the critical workforce challenges and skills supply in tourism, TSC also plans to ensure that the courses available in training institutes are practical, aligned with market needs, and taught according to global best practices. PTSC was formulated under special request from TVEC and the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training to urgently respond to the critical workforce challenges and skills supply in tourism. TSC is explicitly private sector-led and voluntary. 
Elaborating on the focus of the roadmap, TSC Chairman Malik Fernando, Managing Director of Dilmah Teas leisure arm Resplendent Ceylon said, Please dont call it a strategy. We have too many of those and no one ever seems to act on them. This roadmap is a call to action. We hope others will join us, but we dont intend to wait.
The TSC has already prioritized a list of entry-level courses they intend to update with the assistance of TVEC and SLITHM, as well as new courses Sri Lanka needs to introduce to keep pace with global trends.
Speaking at the launch, USAIDs Mission Director to Sri Lanka and Maldives, Reed Aeschliman said, This roadmap demonstrates the kind of vision, leadership, and cooperation from the private sector that is needed to ensure Sri Lanka gets the most from its incredibly talented young women and men.
The roadmap was facilitated by renowned international experts James MacGregor and SrilalMiththapala and brought together by some of the leading minds in the industry; Malik Fernando - Director at MJF Group, Dilmah Tea - Resplendent Ceylon, Angeline Ondaatjie - Managing Director Tangerine Group of Hotels & Tangerine Tours Sri Lanka, ShiromalCooray - Managing Director at Jetwing Travels, JayantissaKehelpannala - Executive VP & Head-Maldivian Resorts, John Keells, SanathUkwatte - Chairman at Mount Lavinia Hotel & President THASL, ChaminWickramasinghe - Director / CEO of Theme Resorts & Spas, DileepMudadeniya - John Keells Group Head of Brand Marketing, Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts, Timothy Wright - Vice President & General Manager at Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo, Steven Bradie-Miles  Center Director William Angliss Colombo Academy of Hospitality Management, PreshanDissanayake - Managing Director, Thambapanni Leisure (SME Sector). Ex-Officio Members included BuddhikaHewawasam  Director General/CEO, SLITHM, KavanRatnayake  Chairman, SLTDA, ManjulaVidanapathirana  Acting Director Industry Liaison, TVEC, Chandra Vithanage  Senior Assistant Secretary General Ceylon Chamber of Commerce. Further HiranCooray, PremaCooray, and Abbas Esufally acted as senior advisors to PTSC.
KavanRatnayake, Chairman of SLTDA and ex-officio member of TSC applauded the efforts of the council, Weve worked with most of these companies and many more to draft the Tourism Strategic Plan 2017-2020. Its extremely encouraging to see a few of them taking action. I hope the rest of the industry joins in. If that happens, SLTDA will be there to help.
One theme in TSCs roadmap is to encourage more women to enter the industry. The launch screened a video produced by YouLead on Women in Tourism. The World University Service of Canada (WUSC) is using the video in a joint national campaign to change attitudes toward vocational educationparticularly among women.
I love tourism, it has been an amazing career for me revealed ShiromalCooray, TSCs Vice Chair and Managing Director at Jetwing Travels, Unfortunately many young women and their parents dont know how interesting and fulfilling it can be. We need to show them. I need to show them. This industry cant grow if half of our workforce sits on the sidelines.
The roadmap is driven by the TSC with the support of the Technical and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC) of the Ministry of Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training &Kandyan Heritage; the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA); the Sri Lanka Institute for Tourism and Hotel Management (SLITHM); the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC); and the Youth Employment and Business Start-up Program (YouLead). YouLead is a $ 12 million project funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by International Executive Service Corps (IESC). 
In a video message to attendees at the launch, Hon. SarathAmunugama, Minister of Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage welcomed private sector participation in the training of Sri Lankas youth. The minister also pledged to extend his fullest support through the ministry to take this initiative forward.

SL has come a long way after rejecting corruption: Teplitz
	
Sri Lanka has come a long way since voters in 2015 rejected the corruption, strife and repression of the past and threw their support behind a reform, reconciliation and accountability agenda, incoming US Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives Alaina Teplitz said.
In her testimony to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on June 28 as President Trumps nominee for US Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives, Ms. Teplitz said, however, the pace of progress on reform and justice has been slow in Sri Lanka.
As anti-Muslim riots in March so painfully demonstrated, the work of mending inter-ethnic and inter-religious fissures remains incomplete, she said.
She said Sri Lanka and Maldives are important to the wider security and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region.
Both nations are positioned astride key shipping lanes that connect the Straits of Hormuz and Malacca, the free navigation of which is vital to US economic and security interests. We must also be mindful of the economic and commercial opportunities each country affords, and the importance of working with them to maintain a rules-based international order, she said.
Ms.Teplitz, who is the current US Ambassador in Nepal, said the US would continue to support Sri Lankas efforts to make good on its commitments to its people to come to terms with its past, implement justice and accountability measures, and secure a peaceful, prosperous future.
We also support growth of Sri Lankas capacity to make greater contributions to regional stability while protecting its own sovereignty and national interests. Sri Lankas success in this endeavor will make it a stronger partner to the United States and contribute to our shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, she said.
If confirmed, Ms. Teplitz said she will work in both Sri Lanka and Maldives to advance US values and a shared vision of good governance, transparent economic development, free navigation and commerce, fair and open investment environments and a stable, rules-based regional order.

UNP back benchers today urged the party leadership to suspend State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran from her portfolio and suspend her from the party.
UNP MPs Thushara Indunil Amarasena, Chaminda Wijesiri and Hesha Withanage told the media they had already requested the party leadership to take action against Ms Maheswaran. We are ashamed to be in Parliament with Ms. Maheswaran and therefore we urge the party leader to take action against her, MP Amarasena said, adding that she had acted against the State by making this statement.
MP Wijesiri said the unruly behaviour of joint opposition MPs in the House yesterday even after Speaker assured them he would take action against Ms Maheswaran was unacceptable.
The unruly behaviour by JO MPs can have dangerous consequences, as it could arouse extremism in the minds of people in the North. The JO has made an attempt to cover up the allegations made against former president Mahinda Rajapaksa by the New York Times. The JO which has become helpless after the NYT story is trying to highlight the Maheswaran incident to cover their sins, he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

## Section: Opinion

USA sought to bully Lanka  during last phase of Eelam war in 2009
	
This essay is an effort to unravel the whispers about an American military teams secret mission to Sri Lanka at the height of the SL armed forces successful squeeze on the LTTE in 2009. The political significance of such a mission is profound and there are numerous tangential issues that are also significant.
The opening to this inquiry in 2018 was provided by Chandre Dharmawardanas welcome initiative in making an ethnographic notation about information mentioned by Foreign Minister Bogollagama in 2012. This item led me (earlier this year) to link it with other morsels of information and to explore the pressures mounted on the GoSL by the Western powers during the last phase of Eelam war IV in 2009. These inquiries have now produced additional information -- morsels once again, but enough to take further steps in unravelling the interventions of USA and its allies. I will mark them in point form as A, B, C et cetera.

A  Ishanka Jayathilaka intervened and brought to light an exclusive news item in the Sunday Times of February 22, 2009 which asserted that a Donor-Co-chair-backed humanitarian operation, spearheaded by the United States, to evacuate civilians trapped in the fighting in the Wanni is now taking shape. This enterprising Sunday Times journalist added that a high-level team of the United States Pacific Command (US PACOM) from their headquarters in Hawaii is now in Colombo for this purpose.
B - This news item alters my previous belief that the recce team came in April and thus enforces a modification in my presentation of the Chandre Dharmawardana item.
C - A well-connected friend with military experience (XY below) was stimulated by my article to search for more information among officers in the armed forces and he sent me this note on April 22, 2018: Having spoken to several people who denied any knowledge, I was informed by a senior SLAF officer who was serving then, that there were several requests in this regard from high-profile US and Indian officials who were present here during that time to bring in Special Forces to help the SL Government, but it was obvious that the real purpose was to rescue Prabhakaran. My friend added that if that had been allowed, we would still be fighting the LTTE, but we Lankans were fortunate to have a President and Defense Minister who did not cave in to these demands.
D - By pure chance, I came across another news item conveying Rohitha Bogollagamas opinions and information which relate to this particular event. The pertinent segment runs as follows:
The then US Ambassador Robert O Blake, who once visited me, wanted to bring an advanced mission to Sri Lanka to see if the surrender would work out -- for the LTTE to surrender to American troops. That was resisted. There was an advanced intelligence team from Hawaii that landed in Sri Lanka to work out the logistics and apparatus. In fact, I did not want that team here. I restricted them to the airport and they went back. Little was known to the general public. We tactically got New Delhi associated with our engagement.
Reworking this information by skimming off the self-aggrandisement, it appears that the American assessment team detailed with working out means of effecting the Washington-Blake scheme of persuading the LTTE to surrender was stymied by the firm stance taken by the Sri Lankan leaders with the covert support of the Indian Government -- covert to the world but not to USA (see below). The key fact or rather apparent fact -- arising from Bogollagamas little excursion is that the team did not get beyond the airport and met GoSL personnel there (if any).


The then US Ambassador Robert O Blake wanted to bring an advanced mission to Sri Lanka to see if the surrender would work out -- for the LTTE to surrender to American troops


E -Having met the senior SLAF officer referred to in B above on June 24, 2018, I was informed that US officers in civilian clothes visited the SLAF HQ in Colombo on one occasion in 2009. He thought it was April but could not be certain. This crucial piece of information suggests that Bogollagama was spinning a tale when he indicated restriction to the airport or, alternatively, that yet another team had arrived in Sri Lanka later in pursuit of renewed US and Western efforts to intervene in favour of the LTTE and the Tamil civilians.


F - These items of information should be set within the context of information provided by Mark Salter in a section within his To End A Civil War (2015) which has the sub-heading: Last Gasp Norwegian peace efforts. Here he writes:
Towards the end of February, reports began to emerge of a Co-Chairs initiative to move civilians trapped in the war zone via the deployment to the northeast coast of US military assets, principally Navy and Air Force craft. Foreign Minister Bogollagama pronounced himself aware of the initiative while also underlining the fact that the government was talking to several other friendly countries -- in particular India -- about the options for evacuating civilians Critical to continued Norwegian efforts to achieve a peaceful ending to the conflict was a secret meeting in Kuala Lumpur between Ambassador Tore Hattrem and chief LTTE representative Kumaran Pathmanathan commonly known as KP. Organised with the support of Basil Rajapaksa, the meeting was also attended by Jon Westborg and Tomas Stangeland on the Norwegian side and V. Rudrakumaran and Jay Maheswaran on the LTTE side (2015: 348).
G - Whether by design or through carelessness, Salter often does not present the dates of events -- a cardinal sin in scholarship. On this occasion too, he does not tell us when precisely the Kuala Lumpur meeting was held. I had hitherto worked within the hypothesis that the USAs recce team had visited Sri Lanka AFTER the Kuala Lumpur gathering. I am wrong. The information ferreted out by someone in the Sunday Times suggests that the international consultation and scheming centred around KP was after an American assessment team had visited the island. Alternatively, both events were more or less coincident.
H - Jeyarajs subsequent discussions with KP reveal quite clearly that Pathmanathans focus was directed towards working out a plan to get the LTTE leadership away to an amenable country -- with Eritrea, South Africa and East Timor as the favoured nations.
I - The various details in the To End a Civil War, the Wikileaks body of US dispatches and government documents relating to the Co-Chair Consortium in Sri Lanka show that the lead-role in the Western-power inputs in the latter bodylay with Blake (representing the US Secretary of State). In part because of their generous financial aid, the key players in the Co-Chair Consortium (chaired by Mahinda Samarasinghe) were a foursome: Blake, Hattrem and the British and French ambassadors. In effect, the indications are that the Norwegian-role at Kuala Lumpur was as proxy and/or lieutenant for USA (a thesis that is being developed by Ishanka Jayathilaka). The four-power combination was thereafter displayed in April 2009 when (Ia) Blake commanded Gotabaya Rajapaksa -- circa mid-April 2009 -- to refrain from attacking the Last Redoubt [that is the No Fire Zone in his misleading nomenclature]; and (Ib) the foreign ministers of Britain, Norway and France hastily assembled and sought entry to Sri Lanka in late April 2009 so as to pressurize the government.
The moral fervour and determination of this endeavour was etched in David Milibands face throughout his stay in Sri Lanka. His demand was rejected point-blank by President Rajapaksa (aided by the quiet backchannel support of India).


J -Incidentally, these stray pieces of information indicate that Bogollagama was providing a misleading spin when he told Dharmawardana that a commando team had turned up in Sri Lanka. So, his tall-tales are now relegated to a footnote status in our inquiries. However, his second public statement in 2017 (in red above) is of much greater weight.

K - Mark the date when an American assessment team seems to have landed in Sri Lanka: at some point in mid-February or around February 20 or 21. At that stage the LTTE still held PTK. Nay more: their fighters had utilised a short-term GoSL ceasefire in early February to launch a highly-successful attack which involved the use of explosives to bust the Kalamadukulam reservoir embankment and flood SL Army positions. At one point, the 59th Divisions 53rd Battalion was pushed back three kilometres. It was only the presence of reserve battalions that enabled the SL Army to stem this counter-attacking advance. Thus, at this point, it was difficult for anyone to conclude that the defeat of the LTTE was around the corner -- even though one could reasonably surmise that it was a likely outcome in the longer run.

L - What then was the PACOM recce team assessing We will never gain concrete data about their objectives. We can reasonably surmise that they wished to protect the corralled Tamil civilians and secure their evacuation to Trincomalee as one element in a deeper, complex plot to save the Tiger leadership (with the exception of Pirapaharan and Pottu Amman) who were to be spirited away to Eritrea or South Africa or Timor. That much is clear from KPs chat with Jeyaraj and the effusive speech from Mike Owens on May 6, 2009 which Daya Gamage revealed to the world. Here, then, is the conclusive verdict from an impeccable source: the effect of what was being proposed would have been to keep the LTTE alive politically and possibly militarily -- the Indian Foreign Minister Shivshankar Menon in response to in 2017 reporter Kelum Bandaras question on this line of interference.

M - We also know that the American recce team felt that these goals were difficult to secure: in their assessment the situation in Sri Lanka made their goals a non-permissive exercise. That incisive line of American military jargon was presented to an American journalist who called in at the embassy in Colombo seeking news about the assessment mission. That summarizing evaluation was guided by the searing experiences of the US Armed Forces when they intervened at Mogadishu in Somalia in October 1993  experiences which have been deeply seared into the American body politic and is encapsulated in the catch-phrase Black Hawk Down.

N - One reason why the exercise was not feasible has been set out by my friend at Point C above: Mahinda and Gotabaya Rajapaksa did not accede to these requests and pressures then; while I have shown via a study of the Wikileaks dispatches that two months later in mid-April Gotabaya blandly accepted Robert Blakes insistence that the SL Army should cease its advance -- though Gotabaya would have been wellaware that the SL Army would initiate an attack on the LTTEs remaining territorial space within the week and that the Sri Lankan Government was determined to defeat the LTTE before the Indian general elections occurred in mid-May.

O - We know that this sturdy position was enabled by the mutual understandings that were being worked out in quiet backroom meetings between sets of three officials on the side of the Indian and Sri Lankan governments. It was P.K. Balachandran who first brought the mechanism to my notice and thus to public notice. M.K. Narayanan (National Security Advisor), Shivshankar Menon (Foreign Secretary) and Vijay Singh (Defence Secretary) were Indias troika; while Basil Rajapaksa, Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Lalith Weeratunga were Sri Lankas threesome. Lalith Weeratunga has recently provided several pertinent details on when these arrangements got moving and how they worked; while Rajiva Wijesinha and Dayan Jayatilleka have supplemented the information with useful commentary.

P - The most critical point, however, has been made by Balachandran. He has told us that the Congress government in Delhi was fully with the Lankan objective of annihilating the LTTE and Colombo recognised this. This reading has been confirmed now in the public engagements of the former Foreign Secretary of India, Shivshankar Menon, in addressing his new book Choices. We can go further and assert that the troika meetings were designed to sustain Sri Lankas understandings on this point and to downplay the public charades of the Indian political leaders.

Q - On this basis and from the recent news reports provided by Lalith Weeratunga and Rajiva Wijesinha on how the two sets of troika master-minded Indo-Lanka relations behind the scenes, it is evident that a key figure in those mediations was the Indian Ambassador in Colombo, namely Alok Prasad. To my mind this raises the possibility that Alok Prasad went into action when the US recce specialists arrived in February 2009 (and again later) and that Indias hostility scotched this line of American imperial action  gunboat diplomacy in humanitarian attire if ever there was such a thing. Did Prasad speak to Blake at this moment Or did the Indian ministers in Delhi convey the governments thoughts to USA via the latters ambassadorial office in Delhi Will we ever know I am whistling into the wind.

R - These items of information highlight the remarks with which I ended my previous excursion in this field. The Sunday Times journalist who ferreted the information (reported below) was a real sleuth. Few other reporters seem to have learnt of the presence of US military officials in Sri Lanka on some assessment mission while the mission was ongoing. Nor were many military and air force commanders in the SL armed forces in the know. My well-connected friend hit many blank walls till he received a vital morsel from an SLAF officer. We are still in the dark about whom the US recce team met and whether they discussed the battlefield situation with their own Military Attach in Colombo (Lt. Col. Lawrence Smith). Secrecy is not a characteristic of Sri Lankan life. But it is an ingredient in the art of war as well as diplomacy. It does not pay to rub salt into the wounds encountered by Uncle Sam in Sri Lanka in 2009. Ssshhh is still the word.

Believe it or not! There is a provincial politico who plays the go-between to help vehicle owners to obtain a roadworthiness certificate for a fee of Rs.500. 

The politico is said to have a close link to a place in the Welikada area authorized to issue these certificates.
On payment of Rs.500 to him, the politico would issue instructions over the phone to the guy in charge of this place to issue the certificate with no questions asked and no matter what the running condition of the vehicle is.

Vijayakala denies she made pro-LTTE statement
	
State Minister of Child Affairs Vijayakala Maheswaran said she had not made any statement with the intention of bringing the LTTE back to life and said that it was a slip of the tongue.
She expressed these views during a telephone conversation with the Social Empowerment Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayaka who called her during a media briefing in Colombo today.
During the conversation, she explained that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had promised to give her Rs. one billion in cash and a Cabinet portfolio at the time of the previous regime.
The telephone conversation went as follows:
Ranjan Ramanayaka - What have you said about the LTTE
Vijayakala - Who said
Ranjan Ramanayaka - Why, you have said. It is in every newspaper.
Vijayakala - Ayoo, Who said that lie. What I said was that we did not have any problems those days.
Ranjan Ramanayaka - Was the schoolgirl raped by relatives
Vijayakala - There was no connection between the brother and uncle. It was done by the drug users. No relations issues exist in the Northern Province as in South.
Ranjan Ramanayaka - You thanked him for the lands that were returned but the President had only visited Jaffna.
Vijayakala - He visited Jaffna only to build his party. We worked hard for his victory. Mahinda Rajapaksa told me that he will win the election with a majority of one million votes and promised me Rs.1 billion and a Cabinet minister post. But we did not support him.
Ranjan Ramanayaka - Was your husband murdered by the LTTE
Vijayakala - No, what nonsense. All problems we have now because of Chandrika and Mahinda.
Ranjan Ramanayaka - Your solution to this problem was wrong.
Vijayakala - I did not say that we want to bring the LTTE back. We lived in peace in that era. Due to being excited I said it by mistake. No one will come back.
Ranjan Ramanayaka - Don't say that LTTE is coming back. Is it not good ok
Vijayakala - No, no Ranjan don't take it seriously, This had been done by the media to defeat Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Ranjan Ramanayaka - Don't make such statements, it is not good for the government.
Vijayakala - No Ranjan, I did not say we want to bring the LTTE back. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Vijayakala's statement: Speaker refers matter to AG
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has asked the Attorney General whether State Minister VijayakalaMahsewarans controversial statement calling for the resurgence of the LTTE violates the Constitution or any other laws of the country and if so to take appropriate action against her.
A question has arisen as to the type of action to be taken against Ms. Maheswaran after the sentiments expressed by MPs in the House today. The MPs stressed the need to take action against Ms. Maheswaran. They argued that the state minister had violated the oath an MP takes as per the annexure 7 of the Constitution, a statement from the Speakers office said.
Meanwhile, the Speaker informed parliament today that he would inquire into the statement made by state minister Maheshwaran regarding the LTTE and take disciplinary action in addition to the inquiry by the Prime Minister on this matter.
He told parliament that he would have to listen to the tape recording of the statement said to have been made by the state minister in Jaffna recently.
The Speaker said this in response to a request made by opposition MPs that the minister should be suspended from attending parliament for having made a statement which promote separatism and violating the constitution.
However, MPs such as Dayasiri Jayasekara, who came to the Well of the House, urged the speaker to suspend her from parliament at least for two weeks until the investigation was over.
The Speaker said he needed time to do so and that he wouldinquire into the matter. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Women for Justice demand Vijayakala to be sacked and arrested
	
Referring to the statement made by State Minister of Child Affairs Vijayakala Maheswaran in Jaffna, where she said there was a need for the reorganization of the LTTE in the North and East, the organization of Women for Justice demanded the relevant Minister to be sacked and arrested.
Addressing a news conference - Women for Justice Co-President Sharmila Gonawala said what she had proclaimed could not be condoned because she wanted the LTTE, a prohibited organization to come again and put the people of this county in danger.
We cant remain silent when such controversial statements were being made by State officials. She must have forgotten the miserable era we had during the time of war. We never want such an era again, Gonawala said.
She said they hoped to lodge a complaint to the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) tomorrow over the statement of the Minister.
Meanwhile, Women for Justice Secretary Savithri Gunasekara said MP Vijayakala is not even eligible to hold the post of MP.
She being the State Minister of Child Affairs said the children of the North and East would be safer when the LTTE would come again. She has forgotten how the children were deprived of their education and forced to join the LTTE military groups by wearing cyanide capsule during the war, Gunasekara said.
Therefore, they insisted the Government to take prompt action over her statement.(Sheain Fernandopulle)
