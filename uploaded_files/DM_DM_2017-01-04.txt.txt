A baggage handler was locked inside an airplanes cargo area during a 1.5-hour flight from North Carolina to Northern Virginia on Sunday. 
A United Airlines spokeswoman said Monday that the airline was looking into how it had happened. The baggage handler, Reginald Gaskin, 45, was unharmed. 
Reached by The Washington Post on Monday night, Gaskin declined to discuss how he wound up inside the plane. He said he had been advised by an attorney not to discuss the matter. 
I thank God, Gaskin said. He was with me. 
United Express Flight 6060, operated by Mesa Airlines, took off from Charlotte-Douglas International Airport just before 3 p.m. Sunday and landed at Washington Dulles International Airport on schedule about 90 minutes later. The plane, a 50-seat Embraer 170, rose to 27,000 feet, according to flight records. A United spokeswoman could not say Monday whether the planes cargo hold was temperature controlled or pressurized. 
At some point, workers in Charlotte, North Carolina, realized there was a possibility that Gaskin was locked in the belly of the airplane and contacted the Federal Aviation Administration.

CTF recommends at least one intl judge to try war crimes
	
The Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms (CTF) in its final report submitted on Tuesday recommended to have a majority of national judges and at least one international judge on every bench to try war crimes and serious violation of Human Rights allegedly taken place in Sri Lanka.
The Court shall ensure that there will be a majority of national judges and at least one international judge on every bench, it recommended.
It also stated that: International crimes such as war crimes and crimes against humanity must be criminalised and incorporated into Sri Lankan law immediately through legislation, without temporal prescriptions and in a manner that allows for the prosecution of these crimes committed in the past, in line with Article 13(6) of the Constitution and Article 13(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).
The report said that consultations in the North and East in particular, as well as in some in the rest of the country, revealed the overwhelming lack of trust in the State, its institutions and mechanisms. The belief was strongly expressed that exclusively domestic mechanisms would not be credible. At the same time, consultations outside of the North and East and with the armed forces, revealed strong opposition to international participation on the mechanisms. Many however, did recognise that given the limitations of existing national capacity in specific areas, international expertise should be engaged. The CTF also notes the commitments made by the Government of Sri Lanka on international participation in the mechanisms, in the resolution that it co-sponsored at the UN Human Rights Council in October 2015.
Therefore, the CTF recommends the participation of both international and national personnel on the four mechanisms ranging from the provision of advice and expertise to active membership of the mechanisms including as judges and prosecutors, as spelt out in the UN Human Rights Council Resolution of October 2015, co-sponsored by the Government of Sri Lanka. It said.
Further, the report recommend that the Special Court should be mandated to try international crimes, including war crimes and crimes against humanity and pay particular attention to crimes of sexual violence and crimes against children. Bearing in mind the mandate of the court in terms of transitional justice and addressing impunity, the CTF recommends that there be no temporal limitations to the jurisdiction of the Special Court.
The CTF presented its final report to former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the Chairperson of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) on Tuesday at the Presidential Secretariat.
The CTF was appointed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on the January 26, 2016 to ascertain public views, particularly those of affected communities across the country, on the reconciliation mechanisms proposed by the Government and incorporated in the Resolution on Sri Lanka at the UN Human Rights Council.
The CTF comprises 11 prominent civil society members with Manouri Muttetuwegama serving as Chairperson and Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu as Secretary.
Issuing a statement the CTF said it was assisted in its work by two advisory panelsone of Experts and the other of Representatives. Consultations throughout the country were carried out by 15 CTF-appointed Zonal Task Forces (ZTFs).
The ZTFs conducted public meetings in all districts as well as focus group discussions with affected individuals and communities.

Female patient falls off ambulance
	
A female patient who was being transported to the Karapitiya Hospital is reported to have fallen off the ambulance on the Southern Expressway this morning after its back door was suddenly opened, police said.

The victim, a resident of Beliatta, was a mother who had delivered a baby a week ago and she had been taken to the Karapitiya Hospital from the Tangalle Hospital for a clinic when the tragedy occurred. (Krishan Jeewaka Jayaruk)

H'tota Port: Can't reject agreement out of hand, Mahanayake
	
Stressing the need to ensure transparency when entering into agreements, the Mahanayake of the Malwatte Chapter, the Most Venerable Thibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thera said yesterday that he could not approve or disapprove of the agreement to hand over Hambantota Port without first perusing it.
He expressed these views when Joint Opposition (JO) members, led by former speaker, UPFA MP Chamal Rajapaksa, met him at the Malwatte Maha Viharaya.
The JO members had talks with the chief incumbents of the Malwatte and Asgiriya Chapters in Kandy yesterday (Jan 3) regarding the agreement to lease the Hambantota Port for 99-years.
We should study the agreement before we proceed. We should not forget that this will provide many job opportunities for the residents of the area," he said.
Mr. Chamal Rajapaksa said that the harbour had been built for the industrial development of the area.I was the minister when the harbour was built. People of the area are agitating as they do not know what this agreement is about. We request the government not to lease the harbour or the lands in the area on secret agreements. They should reveal the contents of the agreement to the country first, he said.
He said that the residents of Hambantota were worried about the agreement and angry about their lands being given to the Chinese.(J.A.L. Jayasinghe)

JO asks CB Chief to clarify Ravi's statement
	
The joint opposition has urged Central Bank Governor Indrajith Coomaraswamy to publicly clarify Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayakes recent statement that Rs.13 billion in Rs.5,000 notes had been spirited out of the CB just two days prior to the 2015 presidential election.
In a letter to the Governor the joint opposition said according to the minister the colossal sum had been distributed among the people who were attending the propaganda rallies in support of the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government.
If Rs.13 billion has been spirited out of the CB and has been in circulation for the past two years, it will be the biggest currency-crime in the history of Sri Lanka. But the minister has not informed the Cabinet, Parliament or the Currency Unit of the CID about his allegation, the letter signed by JO Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena and some others stated.

JO lodges bribery complaint against Malik, Paskaralingam
	
The joint opposition today lodged a complaint against International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama and Prime Minister's Advisor R. Paskaralingam with the Bribery Commission today for allegedly selling the Hambantota Harbour to a Chinese company incurring a loss of Rs. 330 billion to the State.
Addressing a media briefing, Joint opposition member MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said the government had decided to sell the Hambantota Harbour in order to pay the debt amounting to Rs. 1.1 billion which had been taken for the initial constructions of the Hambantota port by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA).
Accordingly, the Cabinet has approved the cabinet paper which was brought out regarding this issue, since this agreement is to pay the debts obtained to construct the Hambantota Harbour. Meanwhile, the officials of the Prime Ministers office have arrived to an agreement with an associate Chinese company without the approval of the Ports and Shipping Ministry, he said.
He said later that the government had stated that not a single cent would be paid as the repayment of debt and those funds would be used for some other purpose.
He said that it was reported that Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga had not been informed or intervened in any of these decisions.
Minister Samarawickrama and Mr. Paskaralingam have intentionally ignored Minister Ranatunga and instructed the SLPA to go ahead with this agreement, he said.
He said Minister Ranatunga had informed the Cabinet that selling the harbour to China Merchant Port Holding Company Limited would cause a staggering Rs. 330 billion to the country.
A group comprising Minister Samarawickrama, Mr. Paskaralingam and P. B. Mangala Yapa of the International Trade Ministry had justified this move and the committee of secretaries is intending to sign this agreement in the coming days, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane and Thilanka Kanakaratne)

Mariah Careys disastrous New Years Eve performance is a fitting end to 2016
	
By Elahe Izadi  (c) 2017,The Washington Post  
Before the ball dropped and 2016 finally came to an end, revelers in Times Square and viewers watching at home were treated to an incredibly awkward five minutes of Mariah Carey. 
The pop diva had just finished singing Auld Lang Syne as part of Dick Clarks New Years Rockin Eve With Ryan Seacrest. Then the track of her 1991 hit Emotions began. Got me feeling, Carey attempted, before stopping and telling her backup dancers to just walk me down the stairs. 
We cant hear, she said. Throughout the rest of the song, Carey walked around the stage and alternated between attempting to sing a phrase and explaining what was happening. 
We didnt have a check for this song, so well just sing. It went to number one, she said. Were missing some of the vocals, but it is what it is. 
A representative for Carey said there were a production issue and technical difficulties with the singers earpiece, adding there unfortunately was nothing she could do to continue with the performance given the circumstances. 
And the singer with a wide vocal range tweeted her own brief explanation: S-- happens. 
Carey was the final headliner before the ball dropped. As Emotions continued, she held the microphone out to the crowd: I say let the audience sing, okay 
Finally the track ended. That was, Carey said, with a long pause, amazing. 
Carey seemed to turn around the performance with another song, as she stood in place and sang We Belong Together. But midway through the 2005 track, she pulled the microphone away, revealing that she had apparently been lip-syncing. One of her backup dancers quickly showed up and walked her toward the front of the stage. 
Bring out the feathers - yes! she said as the performance ended. It just dont get any better. 
According to a statement from Careys representatives, the singer rehearsed the afternoon of the performance with no sound issues but just before taking the stage Saturday night, she alerted stage managers and producers that her earpiece wasnt working, ABC News reported. 
They told her it would be fine once she was on stage. However, that was not the case and they were again told that her ear piece was not working, the statement reads, ABC News reported. Instead of endeavoring to fix the issue so that Mariah could perform, they went live.  Careys representatives said she was intent on honoring her commitment and therefore took the stage essentially flying blind, and defended her use of a backing track as common for live performances, saying she wasnt planning to lip-sync, ABC News reported. 
She was not winging this moment and took it very seriously, Nicole Perna, a publicist for Carey, told Billboard. A shame that production set her up to fail. 
Dick Clark Productions said in a statement that an initial investigation found the company had no involvement in the challenges associated with Ms. Careys New Years Eve performance. The company acknowledged that technical errors on live television happen in very rare instances, but said suggesting that Dick Clark Productions would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd. It added: We want to be clear that we have the utmost respect for Ms. Carey as an artist and acknowledge her tremendous accomplishments in the industry. 
This isnt the first time Carey has been at the centre of a botched high-profile performance. In 2014, she faltered during NBCs annual Christmas in Rockefeller Center tree-lighting special, not hitting a bunch of notes during All I Want for Christmas Is You.

NGOs more powerful than Govt. service today: Nimal Siripala
	
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said that the Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) had become more powerful than government service in the country today where activities of government servants and politicians were monitored by NGOs and media.
He expressed these views at a meeting held with the staff of the Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry last Monday.
When we started doing politics, there were no websites or facebook, but today the country is governed by a group of people from a faraway country and have a website and capable of hacking a facebook, he said.
Minister De Silva said those who work in government service were bound to carry out their duties and responsibilities whichever government comes to power.
He said the government servants should realize that there was another group to look into the shortcomings when carrying out government service.
He further said that government servants get too many holidays and added that when there was additional holiday on a week day, it is difficult to get things done.

No instability in Govt: PM
	
There is no instability in the government though some forces are trying to sabotage development in order to capture power, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
Whatever issues which the MPs of both allies of the government talks of could be resolved through a dialogue. These are minor matters though they shout about on those, the Prime Minister said responding to a question raised by the journalists at a media briefing as to how the government could go-ahead with the economic plans which he came out with last afternoon.
I have discussed the economic development plan with President Maithripala Sirisena and he had agreed to it, the Premier added.
Further he said former President will not only fail to secure the Premiership but to safeguard his MPs post when the development programme goes ahead.
The Prime Minister assured that it would be possible to secure in a few weeks time. We have finalized the GSP plus with the European Union and will be able to get in touch with them in a few weeks time, he said.
Referring to the Hambantota Port Agreement he said a framework agreement has been signed with the China Merchant Company and would sign a follow-up agreement with the company later. There would be at least eight agreements on the development of Hambantota Industrial Zone with Chinese companies and companies of other countries, he said.
Elaborating on the economic development plan he said two primary corridors namely South West Monsoon Corridor and the North Eastern Monsoon Corridor would be set up in this year. Under the South West Corridor he said Kandy, Colombo, Galle, Hambantota and Moneragala will be linked. This would comprise two airports and two ports. The North Eastern Monsoon Corridor would comprise the Trincomallee Harbour. The Trincomallee Port he said would be developed with the assistance of countries such as Japan, India and Singapore.
Further, it was highlighted that Ceylon city which is similar to Dubai International Financial Centre, would be developed. In addition several tourism zones and industrial zones would be developed. The North is to be developed as a special war affected zone while, the Central business district, Aero City and a Science and Technology City would be developed in addition the Bandaranaike International Airport and the Colombo Port to be expanded.
The Prime Minister also said the country will go for Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with China and the Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement with India this year. FTAs would be a key to venture into foreign markets in order to enhance investments, he said.
The GDP would be increased while the minimum wages of a Sri Lankan will be increased to US $ 300 a month, the Prime Minister added.
Coming up with governments plans on the proposed Development Special Provisions Bill, he said he will discuss the amendments with the Chief Ministers of provinces and others shortly. One can easily implement the Bill without involving the provincial councils if they oppose it, he further said. (Yohan Perera)

President cancels Jaffna visit
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has cancelled his Wednesdays visit to Jaffna due to unscheduled meetings in Colombo.
A spokesman of the President has told the Indian Express that unscheduled meetings in Colombo led to the cancellation
But he will be visiting Jaffna on January 25 or any other suitable date before that," the spokesman added.
In Jaffna he was to inaugurate an island-wide mobile app facility to get in touch with the President and track the progress of requests through ministries and departments in the Center. He was also to release about 600 acres of private land occupied by the military.
Indian Express said the President may have been held back by the developing political situation in South with a resurgent former President Mahinda Rajapaksa vowing to overthrow the government in 2017.
The Joint Opposition group and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) are gearing up for frenetic political activity to bring about a regime change this year.
With a Sirisena group member Priyankara Jayaratne resigning from his post of State Minister, and another State Minister Palitha Range Bandara wondering if there is any point in being a minister without work, the media has been speculating about more resignations from the United National Party (UNP)-Sri Lanka Freedom Party Sirisena (SLFP-Sirisena) coalition and crossovers to the Joint Opposition led by Rajapaksa.
With President Sirisena overturning many decisions of UNP ministers, UNP backbenchers in parliament got worried about the Presidents own commitment to the sustenance of the coalition government and the prospects of the government parties in the local bodies and Provincial Council elections in 2017.
Thirty UNPers met the President last Friday in regard to this and the President assured them that he is committed to the coalition. Later he publicly stated that he would not tolerate any party member or coalition partner having links with Rajapaksa.
However, several issues in the coalition remain unresolved. The latest is the disagreement over the deal the UNP-led government had entered into with a Chinese state owned company to manage the Hambantota port.
Disapproving the deal to give the Chinese company 80 percent of the stake in the port for 99 years, the President recently appointed his own representative in the negotiating committee. Given this, there is speculation that he will not attend the January 7 signing ceremony, if it is held at all.
Meanwhile, dissatisfaction and unrest are brewing in North Sri Lanka over the slow pace of post-war reconciliation mechanisms.
Briefing Indian Express on the emerging situation, Northern Provincial Council (NPC) member M.K. Shivajilingam said that the President has not kept his promise to return private lands taken by the military during the war and after. He has released only bits here and there. According to Northern Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran, only 5.2 percent of the land has been returned.
Government has rejected the demand for an international judicial mechanism to go into war crimes charges by the military. But it has not set up even a domestic judicial mechanism. The Office of Missing Persons exists only on paper. All major parties of the majority Sinhalese community have rejected the Tamils call for a federal constitution and the merger of the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
Meanwhile, further centralization is taking place with the Governor of the Northern Province Reginold Cooray setting up an office in his official premises to channel peoples complaints to the President.
He could have set up this facility in the Jaffna Secretariat or the Northern Provincial Council. When there is an elected government, why not allow it to be the channel of communication with the President The Governors action comes in the wake of Tamils demands that the Governor be figure made a figurehead under the elected Chief Minister, Shivajilingam said.

Putins  masterstroke of  non-retaliation
	

By Oliver Carroll 
(c) 2016, Foreign Policy  
MOSCOW - It was one of the most heavily anticipated diplomatic moves of the year, but when it came down to it, the Obama administrations decision to expel 35 embassy staff, close two compounds, and impose sanctions on top intelligence chiefs caught Russia off guard. 
The move was virtually unprecedented in the post-Cold War world. But that was the point. It was a gesture more at home in the 1970s, or 1980s, when tit-for-tat expulsions were part of the game. For months as the Russian hacking scandal grew, the Obama administration sat on its hands, refusing to disclose links between Russian operatives and WikiLeaks, of which the CIA claimed to have evidence. 
We all expected a more targeted response, frankly, says Vladimir Frolov, a security expert and former government advisor. 
Margarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of RT, the Kremlins English-language propaganda arm, summed up the mood inside the elite. Oooh, Im so scared! she wrote on Twitter. 
Russias normal response to what it considers aggressive actions from the West is to act reciprocally - and asymmetrically. 
When an American adoptive father was acquitted for the manslaughter of a Russian toddler - the baby died of heatstroke after being left in a parked car for nine hours - Russian authorities responded with a draconian law banning adoptions by American families. And when, in 2005, three children of Russian diplomats were assaulted in Warsaw, three Poles found similar troubles in Moscow. 
The logic is that you cant do anything to Russia without the expectation that the exact same thing will happen to you, says Fyodor Lukyanov, an expert close to the Russian foreign-policy elite. 
First indications were that it was business as usual. Writing on Facebook, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova promised official statements, countermeasures, and much else besides. There was an expectation that the Kremlin was preparing another attack on perceived Western soft targets - perhaps on orphans, human rights groups, or the LGBT community. 
On Friday morning, local media were providing teasers as to what the asymmetric response might be. There were reports that the Anglo-American School of Moscow, a favourite of foreign diplomats, would be closed. Country residences for U.S. diplomats would be shuttered. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov suggested to the Kremlin that there should be 35 reciprocal expulsions - 31 from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and four from the consulate in St. Petersburg. 
As the day progressed, however, it became clear that the Kremlin was preparing a more sophisticated reaction. 
Various government spokespeople began to paint a picture of sanctions pushed personally by a bitter man. These were Barack Obamas sanctions, not Donald Trumps - not even U.S. sanctions. They were the sanctions pushed in a final, futile burst of hatred by a lame-duck president. Even Secretary of State John Kerry was a good man, undermined by an emotional president, according to the Foreign Ministrys Zakharova. 
The surprise came around 4 p.m. local time, via a statement was published on the Kremlins website. Russia would resist even the minimum expected diplomatic response of retaliatory expulsions, the statement read: [Russia] will not resort to irresponsible kitchen diplomacy but will plan our further steps to restore Russian-US relations based on the policies of the Trump Administration. 
Putin even invited the children of U.S. diplomats to his New Years party. 
With that statement, the Russian president marked a complete about-turn of his traditionally petulant diplomacy. Tactically, it was a triumph. Suddenly Obamas sanctions, designed so as to be untouchable by a future Trump administration, no longer seemed so irreversible. 
It is a very smart move, Lukyanov says. It will humiliate Obama even more. 
Putins magnanimous gesture also eliminates any doubt as to the likely direction of Russia policy under the Trump administration. 
Trump is now boxed in, Frolov says. He has become an unwitting Russian agent - everything he does now will be considered payback for this and earlier election services. 
That, of course, is just fine with the Kremlin. Insiders have reported euphoria among certain sections of the elite. Trumps election, together with the appointment of Kremlinophiles - including Rex Tillerson as secretary of state-designate and the mooted choice of Thomas Graham as ambassador to Russia - has inverted the geopolitical landscape as far as Moscow in concerned. Most economists are already writing in a partial lifting of sanctions next year. 
Given the obvious gestures, it would take a brave man to bet against improvement of relations between Russia and the United States. But there is no guarantee that they will improve to the degree expected. Clear differences of opinion over Ukraine, Iran, and China remain obvious stumbling blocks that Trumps idiosyncratic foreign policy will struggle to overcome. 
Many inside the elite believe it would be idiocy to chain Russias fortune to the success of this wacko, says Frolov. 
But signs point to a good start to the relationship. Putin and Trump will do a kissy-face reset at Februarys Helsinki summit, he says. They will get along just fine for about a year, or until one of them invades somewhere, and then all bets are off.

S. Korean president refuses to testify in  impeachment  trial
	

By Kim Tong-Hyung | AP
SEOUL, South Korea 
South Korean President Park Geun-hye on Tuesday refused to testify in a case that will decide her future following her impeachment over a corruption scandal, forcing the Constitutional Court to delay the start of oral arguments. 
After Parks refusal, the nine-justice court asked her to testify on Thursday, when some of her current and former aides are also scheduled to testify. Her no-show brought criticism from lawmakers, who serve as prosecutors in the trial. 
The court has said it cannot force Park to appear in the hearings, which under law can proceed without her if she refuses for a second time to appear. 
Lawmaker Kweon Seong Dong, the chief prosecutor in the trial, questioned why Park cannot defend herself in court when just two days ago she vehemently rejected the accusations of corruption in a hastily arranged meeting with reporters at Seouls presidential Blue House. 
Its not good etiquette to the justices and also inappropriate for the president, as the defendant of the impeachment trial, to say this and that to the media outside of court, Kweon told reporters. 
Lee Jung-hwan, Parks lawyer, said she does not plan to appear Thursday and will probably not testify during the impeachment trial. 
The trial in the Constitutional Court will decide if Park should permanently step down or be reinstated. If the court formally removes Park from office, a presidential election will be held within 60 days. South Koreas opposition-controlled parliament voted last month to impeach Park, weeks after state prosecutors accused her of colluding with a close confidante to extort money and favours from companies and allow the friend to manipulate
government affairs. 
After indicting Parks friend, Choi Soon-sil, Chois niece, and several former government and presidential officials for allegedly helping Choi, state prosecutors handed over the investigation to a special prosecution team, which has been focusing on proving bribery suspicions between Park and business giant Samsung. 
The investigators want to bring home Chois daughter, Yoora Chung, who was arrested in Denmark, as they look into the suspicions that Samsung sponsored Choi in exchange for government favours. The inquiry has led to the arrest of the countrys former Health Minister, Moon Hyung-pyo, who allegedly forced the National Pension Service to support a merger between two Samsung affiliates last year. The deal shaved the funds stake in one of the companies by an estimated hundreds of millions of dollars, but allowed Samsung scion Lee Jae-yong to promote a father-to-son succession of leadership and boost corporate wealth at the group. 
Lee has apologized for the use of corporate funds to buy a horse for Chung, an equestrian athlete, but denied that Samsung sought favours from Choi or Parks administration. There are also questions as to why Samsung financially supported a winter sports centre run by Chois niece and a sports management firm Choi established in Germany.

Sobhitha Theras succeeding Korean monk deported
	
A tussle between two fractions of monks over the Chief Incumbent post of Kotte Sri Naga Viharaya led to the deportation of a Korean monk last night, who was living in the temple. He was deemed to be the successor of late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera.
Officials of the Department of Immigration and Emigration arrived at the Sri Naga Viharaya yesterday afternoon on a directive of Minister of Internal Affairs S. B. Navinna to deport the Korean monk Byung Moon Oh from the country with immediate effect, sources said.
Following a four hour struggle at the temple, the Immigration authorities with the backing of Mirihana Police took the Korean monk into custody amidst intervention of many supporters and lawyers that were obstructing the Ministers decision.
Ven. Sobhitha Theras chief disciple Ven. Wathuruvila Sri Sujatha Thera backed by many supporters who believes and supports Moon Oh Thera to be the rightful heir to the temple had tried to prevent the latter being taken away by the Immigration officials.
The Attorneys appearing for Sujatha Thera had claimed that they will disregard Minister Navinnas directive to deport Moon Oh Thera and had strictly denied to handover the Korean monk to the authorities.
The tussle for the chief incumbent post of the Kotte Sri Naga Viharaya was sparked when Nugegoda Magistrate had issued an order preventing Ven. Wathuruvila Sri Sujatha Thera from entering the temple on the day in which the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera was cremated on (Thursday), November 12, 2015.
The Nugegoda Magistrate Kanishka Wijeratne on November 16, 2015 ordered the Mahanayake of Kotte Sri Kalyani Sri Dhamma Maha Sangha Sabha Ven. Ittepane Dhammalankara Nayaka Thera, Ven. Udathalakande Ariyarathana Thera and Chairman and Secretary of Kotte Naga Vihara Dayaka Sabaha to appear before court on the following day over this issue at the temple.
A case had been filed by the seventh disciple in line of late Ven. Sobhitha Thera about rightful heir of the chief incumbent post of the temple in the early stage of last year.
According to the sources, the first and second disciple of Sobhitha Thera had been expelled as disciples by the Sobhitha Thera himself sometime prior to his death. The third and the fourth disciples had reportedly left their robes in the past and the fifth disciple was the Korean monk.
In the developing court case the Nugegoda Magistrate had reportedly stated recently that the Korean monk was suitable for the heir of the temples chief incumbent post and that the case was to be summoned again in the near future to finalise the issue.
The Ministers directive comes in the meantime that the Korean monk be deported with immediate effect with no specific reason mentioned to the authorities.
Moon Oh Thera had first met Ven. Sobhitha Thera in 1987 when he first visited Sri Lanka as a layman following Mahayana. Since then he had been in close company of Sobhitha Thera until he started following Theravada and became a Buddhist monk and ordained in 2000 by his teacher.
Since then, Moon Oh Thera was residing in Kotte Sri Naga Viharaya though his visa status in Sri Lanka was 'Tourist'. He had travelled many times back and forth and had been staying in the country renewing his tourist visa, the Immigration sources disclosed.
The Thera was to be boarded on a Thai Airways Flight TG 308 that was scheduled to depart from the Bandaranaike International Airport at 1.15am this morning bound for the Republic of Korea, to the Theras motherland, which he left for almost three decades.
The Daily Mirrors attempts to get Minister S. B. Navinnas comment on the sudden deportation of the Thera were futile. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Sri Lanka Insurance inaugurates business activities for 2017
	

The inauguration of business activities at Sri Lanka Insurance (SLI) took place on January 2 amidst a distinguished gathering comprising Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim, Public Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickremaratne and Joint Managing Directors T.M.R. Bangsa Jayah and Aruna Siriwardena.
After the religious observances performed by the leaders of all four religions, the audience was addressed by the joint managing directors who appreciated the efforts put in by the SLI staff during the previous years and called on them to perform even better during 2017.
Addressing the gathering, Hashim described the contribution made by SLI to the development of the country during the year as one of the biggest among state institutions.
The government lays emphasis not only on investing in physical infrastructure but also on investing in social infrastructure by improving the human capital. The budget proposals were also designed with these goals in mind. Everyone at SLI should be justifiably proud of this contribution, he said. 
The event also coincided with the 55th anniversary of SLI, which was established in 1962, and a cake was cut on the occasion to commemorate this landmark event.

Syrian army advances as rebels put  peace talks on hold
	

Syrias ceasefire appeared under threat as government forces intensified their attacks near Damascus and around 10 rebel groups said they were suspending talks about planned peace negotiations this month. The talks are due to take place in the Kazakh capital Astana in late January but the rebels said they were pulling out of discussions due to violations by Damascus of a four-day old truce.
The talks are being organised by Russia and Iran, which support the Syrian regime, and Turkey, which back the rebels.
As these violations are continuing, the rebel factions announce... the freezing of all discussion linked to the Astana negotiations, they said in a joint statement.
The rebels said they respected the ceasefire across the whole of Syria... but the regime and its allies have not stopped shooting and have launched major and frequent violations, notably in the (rebel) regions of Wadi Barada and Eastern Ghouta, near Damascus, they said.
For the past two weeks, even before the start of a nationwide truce brokered by Ankara and Moscow, Syrias air force has launched almost daily bombing raids on Wadi Barada, some 15 kilometres (10 miles) from Damascus.
Any (advance) on the ground goes against the (ceasefire) agreement and if things dont return to how they were before, the accord will be considered null and void, the rebel statement added.

## Title: 700 to 1,000 leopards in Sri Lanka; researcher

700 to 1,000 leopards in Sri Lanka; researcher
	
There are about 1,000 leopards across Sri Lanka and they are a keystone species in ecological parlance of the country, a wildlife researcher has said.
An article published on the website of multimedia publication Motherboard under the title Saving Leopards Is Hard, Especially with All the Landmines by Smriti Daniel, said leopards are more important to the ecosystem than their numbers would suggest.
Wildlife researcher Anjali Watson has said that leopards are an umbrella species  because they are wide ranging animals, protecting them would mean protecting many others in the same territories.
The full article
Wilpattu, Sri Lankas oldest and largest national park, was once a warzone. The fighting between the Sri Lankan state and the militant separatist group Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) that began in the 1980s had spilled over into these wild lands.
Wildlife researchers Anjali Watson and Andrew Kittle remember hearing stories from soldiers stationed in these forests. The men recalled nights when they would be jolted awake by the sound of landmines exploding in the pitch darkness, somewhere beyond the border of their camps. Nervously, they wondered whether guerillas had triggered the bombs, and if their enemies would soon close in on them.
But the dawn would bring evidence of a different kind of victim. The remains of peacocks were found lying in heaps of shredded feathers; elephants lay with limbs blown off. A few leopards and bears were also shot because men who encountered them were afraid, Watson told me, explaining that the thick, thorny forests often swallowed any evidence.
The park itself was off limits to the researchers during the conflict. But even after a ceasefire signed in 2002, it remained unsafea mine claimed the lives of a jeep full of wildlife enthusiasts in 2006 and a year later, Wilpattus park warden Wasantha Pushpananda was ambushed and killed by the LTTE while on an inspection tour with his team.
It wasnt until the nearly 30-year-long war came to an end in 2009, and many landmines laboriously cleared, that Watson and Kittle were able to readily move about Wilpattu again. They are now publishing data from one of the most comprehensive studies of the leopard population in Wilpattuthe first since the Smithsonian Institution did a more general survey in the late 1960s.
A husband and wife team, Kittle and Watson head The Leopard Project at the Wilderness and Wildlife Conservation Trust (WWCT) in Sri Lanka. They have been studying leopards for over a decade and were responsible for gathering the data that put the native big cat on the International Union for Conservation of Natures Red List of endangered species in 2008.
Being on the Red List influences both conservation and funding attention, Watson said, explaining that IUCN tracks the global status of various species. In Sri Lanka, the states conservation programs had previously been focused overwhelmingly on the elephant, but the IUCN listing has driven a surge of interest in the leopard and its significance as an apex predatorresiding comfortably at the very top of the food chain on this island.
Kittle, Watson and I meet in their small office, perched above a garage in central Colombo, the commercial capital of Sri Lanka. The two sit across from each other and share a desk, seeming to be seldom out of each others company. Their rhythm has rootsthe two met in university and have since travelled widely, always working closely together as a team. When their children were born, they simply took the kids along to the field, something they continue to do. Little drawings by Ayla and Amara decorate an entire wall in their office.
Watson said she and Kittle first knew they could make such a close partnership work when they were assigned to help reestablish a wild population of native primate species on an uninhabited island on the Panama Canal in the late 90s.
There was just the two of us, and a guard who spoke Spanish, Watson tells me, laughing. I spoke no Spanish, Andrew spoke some Spanish, and the only other contact we had was a boat coming in every Saturday to bring us provisions. We spent nearly two years there, and I thought if we could do this...
Today, though their work still might take them far afield, Sri Lanka is homeWatson said her heart is with this island because she grew up here. The duo are working toward establishing a comprehensive habitat use plan for the Sri Lankan leopard by 2020, including a population distribution map, and assessments of its habitats across the island. But tracking this predator has always presented a challenge.
When Watson and Kittle first told me this, I was surprised. I have seen leopards in Yala National Park in southeast Sri Lanka, where the big cats draped themselves decoratively over high branches and rolled around on dusty trails as tourists watched. But Kittle explains that in Wilpattu, and pretty much everywhere else in the island nation,the Panthera pardus kotiya is notoriously shy.
Usually cryptic carnivores like this are really difficult to spot, he said, adding that leopards manage to remain elusive despite existing in relatively high numbers in little pockets across the island.
Now, in the Peak Wilderness Sanctuary in central Sri Lanka, where tea plantations abut dense forest, encounters between leopards and people are on the rise. As more and more wilderness is cleared, Kittle and Watson say leopards and other animals are increasingly moving around and even breeding in habitat mosaics, or heavily fragmented forested areas surrounded by a patchwork of farms, plantations and homesteads. As a result, villagers are reporting more leopards sightings.
With one legendary exceptionin the 1920s, the maneater of Punanai was a voracious killerSri Lankan leopards are not maneaters.
In Dickoya, people have escaped encounters with the animal with just some deep scratches. Watson and Kittle, increasingly called on to reassure nervous communities, use these incidents to help convince villagers that the leopards are likely as frightened of the people as the people are of them. Working closely with the management of sprawling tea estates, they are now trying to find ways to prevent humans from barging in on the leopards. But to do this, they first have to know where they will be.
In the years that Watson and Kittle have been out in the field, theyve seen the tracking technology available evolve. In their earliest forays into the field, they would rely on sighting the animals directly and recording each encounter. Some of Yalas leopards, such as one who boasted bold spots in the shape of a W on his forehead, were immediately recognizable, others could only be identified by closely examining photographs of the unique pattern of rosettes on their bodies.
The couple would also rely on tracing Paw Impression Pads: sweeping leaf litter away from a likely spot, they would create a sandy clearing, then return to record pugmarks. This technique allowed them to set up TrailMasters, camera traps that ran on film, to monitor spots where there was a lot of leopard traffic.
Watson and Kittle stuck with the technology up until 2012, before they switched to digital cameras. Film cameras could be cumbersome in the field, demanding hooking up wires and multiple components, but digital ones offered better battery life, were usually more weather resistant, and enabled them to get results faster and cover larger areas.
Ironically, conservationists must often rely on technology developed for hunters, Kittle said, but at least there are hundreds of cameras to choose from. Currently, they use Scoutguard SG565F cameras which have an incandescent flash (old style, bright white). This is not de rigueur these days in remote camera work as infra-red or low-light flash is the thing, Kittle said.But we need to identify individuals in order to estimate population densities etc. and only incandescent flash is capable of that for a moving animal.
However, the technology still comes with its own share of glitches. The camera trap is triggered by data from a highly sensitive Passive Infra-Red motion sensor, said Watson, adding that deploying this technology in Sri Lankan parks has been a steep learning curve. In Wilpattu we found that the sun rays in the morning could interfere with the beam, and we would have 3000 shots of sunlight, she said.
In the Horton Plains dew and mist would trigger the trap, in Ritigala ants were building nests inside the lens, and in the Peak Wilderness Sanctuary we have all these pictures of leopards with a spider web across one corner of the image. Thank god, they were still usable.
Watson says that there are between 700 and 1000 of this apex predator across the 65,000 sq km island. They are a keystone species, in ecological parlance, Watson told me,They are more important to the system than their numbers would suggest. She explained that leopards are an umbrella species  because they are wide ranging animals, protecting them would mean protecting many others in the same territories.
The team uses scati.e. leopard fecesanalysis to understand the leopards diet and hunting patterns. Felids have very short guts and pass out hair, bones, nails, quills etc. undigested, said Kittle. Efforts are underway to fine tune mathematical equations that can then transform scat analysis output into an estimate of biomass consumed, providing a clearer, more reliable picture of leopards dietary choices.
Kittle and Watson have watched the post-war transition with interest, and have been curious about the conflicts impact on local wildlife. Watson points out that war can lead to decimation of habitats and rampant poaching, but that in other cases mines can also keep people out, somewhat protecting wildlife from human intervention or development.
Now, as people return to the formerly war torn areas in the north and east, they have begun reclaiming lands or clearing new acres in previously untouched areas like the sprawling forests of the Wanni. Theyre building homes and preparing the once wild land for farming. But this trend is not confined to one part of the island, and everywhere protected areas are coming under threat.
I think the big concern is the pace of this whole post-war development drive, warns Watson. There is so much we dont know, so many areas we havent explored. We could be losing species we never even knew about.
But Kittle said studying the leopard has left him tentatively optimistic. For us, theres always this thrill, no matter how often you see the animal. You have this respect for its ability to exist in very compromised locations, often alongside people, with minimum conflict. You have to admire that.

Trump: North Korea intercontinental missile wont happen
	

By Philip Rucker (c) 2017, The Washington Post  
President-elect Donald Trump contended Monday night that North Korea would not be able to develop a nuclear weapon capable of reaching the United States, despite its claims to the contrary, and berated China for not doing enough to help stop the rogue states weapons program. 
Trumps declarations on Twitter came after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said in a New Years address that the country had reached the final stages of testing its first intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach the United States. 
It wont happen! Trump tweeted. 
The president-elect -- who spent Monday with advisers at Trump Tower in New York following his holiday respite in Florida -- did not specify what if anything the United States might do under his command to stop North Korea from developing the missile. 
In a second tweet, Trump sought to shame Chinese leaders for trading with the United States but doing little to help stop North Koreas development of nuclear weapons.
