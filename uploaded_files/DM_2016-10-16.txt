Lasanthas murder: Police cant come to a conclusion on suicide note
	
IGP Pujith Jayasundara yesterday said the Police were unable to come a conclusion regarding the suicide note allegedly written by the retired army officer who claimed responsibility for the murder of Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge.
Speaking to the media after attending an event in Vauvniya, he said the CID had carried out a separate investigation into the alleged suicide of the army officer who was found hanging.
The IGP also said the reason behind the suicide note should be investigated.
There are certain facts that should be considered before declaring the note is genuine. We should first find out why he made such a claim and whether it was a personal or job related issue. Things that prompted him not only to make such a claim but also pushed him to take his own life should be thoroughly investigated. Investigations should verify whether his suicide was a result of mental pressure or any threats leveled on him, IGP Jayasundara said. (Romesh Madushanka)

Norochcholai breakdown a result of new shoddy contractor: JVP
	
Stating that the breakdown of the Norochcholai power plant was a result of giving the construction contract to a party which had done a shoddy job, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today said an investigation has to be carried out to determine who was at fault.
JVP Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath said it is obvious that the contractor had constructed the plant at a low quality and they had no expertise in the field.
As a result the power plant had broken down on several occassions.
This government has the responsibility of carrying out an investigation about the matter because they had so much to say about the power plant when they were in the opposition, Mr. Hearth added. (Yohan Perera)

Possible power cuts as Norochcholai breaks down, again
	
The Ministry of Power and Energy is to notify the public of possible power cuts in the coming days after assessing the damage at the Norochcholai power plant.
A breakdown in all three plants in Norochcholai has prompted authorities to assess for damages. Authorities said an internal issue was found to be the reason for the breakdown. 
Ministry sources stated the power plant was at a complete standstill at the moment and that the CEB was providing electric from other sources at the moment.
We are in the process of assessing the damage. We will notify the public tomorrow if any power cuts are needed, Minister of Power and Energy Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
The first plant will take five days to repair, while the second and third power plants will take a week and a month to repair, respectively. 
We should be able to manage with what we have if the public is careful with the consumption. We are also hoping to requests companies to use generators until we have finished repairs at the plant, the Minister said.

## Title: Yameen loyalists take court action to remove Gayoom from PPM leadership

Yameen loyalists take court action to remove Gayoom from PPM leadership
	
The Progressive Party of the Maldives has descended into open warfare with MPs loyal to incumbent president, Abdulla Yameen, seeking court action to remove his half-brother from the ruling partys leadership.
Two MPs are seeking a ruling removing Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, 78 years, from the partys presidency and an order requiring its council to handover leadership to a person who can protect public interest, according to a petition lodged at the civil court on Thursday.
Court officials posted a summons printed on red paper at the entrance to the PPM offices on Saturday when staff there refused to accept the notice.
It said that a party representative endorsed by the partys council must present himself or herself to court at 3:30pm today, or the case would be heard in absentia.
The summons follows days of high drama, where Gayooms son was struck off the political party registry by the elections commission and three Yameen loyalists were sacked from the PPM council.
The long-rumoured rift between the Gayoom brothers broke into the open in June when Gayoom, who ruled the Maldives for 30 years, refused to endorse Yameen for the 2018 polls. Days later, the partys disciplinary committee expelled his son, MP Faris Maumoon, for voting against a government-sponsored bill.
Gayoom subsequently suspended the partys 33-member governing council, in which Yameen supporters hold a majority, and launched a reform agenda, accusing MPs of facilitating corruption and reversing democratic reforms.
The elections commission said it had struck off Faris name from the PPMs registry on Thursday following an investigation into a petition filed by 20 members of the PPM council.
Faris told Mihaaru, a local newspaper, that the commissions decision was unlawful. He maintained that his expulsion was invalid claiming the disciplinary committee had failed to follow due process. He added: It is very dangerous for other political party members if the elections commission continues to take matters into its own hands. Who knows who the elections commission may remove tomorrow
The party is being plunged into disarray just months to go before polls for local council elections.
Council members loyal to Yameen had called a press conference on Thursday, calling on candidates interested in running on the party ticket to submit application forms to the Yameen-faction instead of the Gayoom faction.
They also urged Gayoom to re-convene the council, but said they would win elections without his support.
Everyone who wants to compete on the council elections on behalf of PPM from across the country, from Thuraakunu all the way to Addu, please adjust your direction and come to us, said Majority Leader Ahmed Nihan.
MP Abdul Raheem Abdulla, the vice president of the party, said: We are certain that President Yameen will win the 2018 presidential elections. Those who dont want to support him should stay home. Our parliamentary group and the partys council will take him there.
Abdulla would head the preparations for the elections, the Yameen faction announced.
On Saturday, Gayoom sacked Abdulla and two others loyal to Yameen from the council.
Instead of supporting me, you have continued to act against the parts charter and ideology, without my knowledge. You have been making council members sign various petitions without my knowledge, and spreading lies about me in the media, Gayoom wrote in a letter to Abdulla.
The lawmaker declined to comment immediately.
The two others who were sacked were Zahid Rameez, who was appointed to the council by Gayoom, and Ibrahim Yoosuf, who heads the partys youth wing.
Zahid was accused of posting rude and disrespectful comments on social media, and Yoosuf was told he was no longer eligible for the position as he was 31 years old  the party charter requires that the head of the youth wing be below 31 years of age.
Abdulla and Zahid were replaced with former Home Minister Umar Naseer and Gayooms personal assistant, Ahmed Sofwan. (Maldives Independent)

CNH to stop accepting unidentified bodies; morgue full
	
The Colombo National Hospital (CNH) had decided to stop accepting unidentified bodies to the mortuary following the Hospitals morgue becoming full with unidentified and unclaimed human bodies, Deputy Director of the CNH Dr. Anil Jasinghe said.
He said that he had informed the Western Province Senior DIG of Police regarding the decision.
Dr. Jasinghe, speaking to the Daily Mirror said dozens of unclaimed bodies were kept in mortuary freezers of the hospital for more than seven months, because the Police stations that had stored the bodies until they were claimed by families had not yet completed their examinations.
He said with the time of the decomposed bodies are kept in the mortuary, it has left the atmosphere of the hospital with a stench.
The capacity of the mortuary is 40 bodies at a time. Now the majority of the bodies are those that were brought by the Police after no one had laid claim. They are kept here for seven and eight months without any further action. Even though we have informed the Police stations to come and collect the bodies, none of them have responded, he said.
He said the mortuary cooler was in a need of a repair since it had deteriorated and dilapidated after keeping the bodies for a long period of time.
He said that those who stay and work at wards and surgery Operating Theaters located adjourning to the CNH mortuary had complained about the unbearable smell comes out of the mortuary.
We are unable to store the dead bodies of the patients, who die at the CNH because the mortuary is full, Dr. Jasinghe added. (Piyumi Fonseka)
