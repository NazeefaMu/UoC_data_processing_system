Britain moves to deport Tamil asylum seeker
	
UK immigration officials have detained Janahan Sivanathan, a 22-year-old Tamil asylum seeker from Sri Lanka.
Janahan is being held at the Morton Hall detention centre in Lincolnshire while the government tries to deport him. Supporters say that Janahan was horrendously tortured as a school student during the war in Sri Lanka, after he was rounded up and held captive for ten days.
His lawyer filed a fresh claim and submitted new medical evidence on 1 June. However his case will not be heard in court until 15 July. The Home Offices own guidance says that victims of torture should only be detained in exceptional circumstances.
Janahans supporters say that his medical case history shows he suffered serious torture and is at high risk of suicide. Doctors are warning that his mental health has already deteriorated while in detention and that he is effectively being re-traumatised.(Open democrocy)

	The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today urged the government to appoint the members to the Constitutional Council and re-instate the independent commissions before the next general election.
	JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said the government had not fulfilled its promises other than to implement the 19th Amendment to the Constitution and urged it to fulfil the promises made to the people at the presidential election.
	Government has not worked out a methodology to ensure the Rs.2,500 pay hike for private sector employees and we doubt whether anyone had paid the mansion tax imposed through the budget, he said.
	Mr. Silva said that investigations into allegations of bribery and corruption had been neglected and wondered whether it had happened with the knowledge of the government.
	He said there was mayhem in the country because the government is facing a state of paralysis in parliament and was preventing the people from electing a government of their choice.
	Mr. Silva said a group of MPs with the backing of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa were leading the country to anarchy. He said they had done their best to disrupt the enactment of 19A and were now attempting to thwart the appointment of the members to the Constitutional Council. (Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH

No legal issue over Arjuna's appointment: Ranil
	
	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday that there was no legal impediment for the appointment of Arjuna Mahendran as the Central Bank Governor.
	The Prime Minister was responding to Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) Leader Dinesh Gunawardane, who questioned the eligibility of Mr. Mahendran to hold such a post as a Singaporean citizen.
	The Prime Minister said the criterion, to be followed in the appointment of the Monetary Board and the Central Bank Governor, had been laid down in the Finance Act.
	He said a Parliamentarian or a Provincial Council member could not be appointed to the post according to the law. A government official or a judicial officer could also not be appointed at the same time, he noted.
	Explaining the criteria, he said it had not been stipulated that a foreign national should not be appointed.
	"Some, using the media favouring them, carry out a campaign that the appointment of Arjuna Mahendran has triggered a crisis in the international arena. Yet, it does not seem to be true when examining the international transactions of the Central Bank," he said.
	Mr. Wickremesinghe said these critiques remained tight lipped, when the public wealth was plundered with the involvement of foreign nationals at that time.
	"You are opposed when a foreign citizen is used to curb corruption, to protect public wealth and state resources," he said.
	Mr. Mahendran is born, raised and educated in Sri Lanka. He had served in the Central Bank for 11 years.
	"After that, he held key positions both in the government and private sectors. In 2002, he was the Chairman of Board of Investment. At that time Prof. G.L. Peiris who held ministerial posts under different governments, was the subject minister. He left the country because of the Rajapaksa regime. Therefore, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should be held responsible for it," he said.
	Also, the Prime Minister said not only Mr. Mahendran but also many others had to leave the country during the Rajapaksa regime started in 2006.
	He said the situation was even worse for minority communities.
	"We lost our Tamil friends Joseph Pararajasingham, N. Raviraj and T. Maheswaran. There was terror in the country at that time," he said. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Pair indicted for Lankans murder in US
	
	Two men were indicted this week on capital murder charges in the April 29 fatal shooting of a convenience store owner in Beaumont, United States.
	John David Johnson, also known as Sean, and Chandler Kyle Ventress, both 19, are accused in the death of Mettha Kuruppu, 52.
	Both men are being held at the Jefferson County jail on $2 million bonds each.
	Ventress told detectives he planned to rob the Pick-N-Shop store on Major Drive when he killed its owner, according to a probable cause affidavit in the case.
	Officers responding to the crime scene shortly after midnight April 29 found Kuruppu lying in a pool of his own blood behind the counter where hed been tallying the day's receipts, according to the affidavit.
	Video surveillance recordings show that, after being shot, Kuruppu walked around a little before he got woozy and fell over where officers found him.
	Recordings also captured two masked men entering the store together. One, whom police have identified as Ventress, pointed a firearm at Kuruppu while the second man, whom police have identified as Johnson, stood in the background pointing something that was under a white towel, which gives police the impression the second suspect was also armed.
	Ventress fired twice, the document states, and both ran away without taking anything from the store.
	The police-provided portion of the video showed Kuruppu trying to bat away the robber's pistol as Kuruppu activated an alarm.
	Police said Kuruppu then grabbed a BB gun with which to defend himself, but the robber shot him in the chest.
	Kuruppu, a native of Sri Lanka, bought the store two years ago.
	If convicted, both men could face the death penalty because they were committing an armed robbery, an aggravated felony, when the murder occurred.(Beaumont Enterprise)

The date will coincide with the launch of services to Los Angeles, one of three new Qatar Airways destinations in the US for 2016.
Flying a long-haul service to Philadelphia, which is a key business and leisure destination and one of the busiest airports in the US, will enable Qatar Airways to maximise the A350s efficiency and performance and allow its US passengers with the first opportunity to try the worlds newest aircraft.

Starting on 1st March 2016 and 16th March 2016, the A350 will fly on one daily flight to New York and also to Boston; meaning three of Qatar Airways US destinations will all be served by the A350.
Qatar Airways A350 offers outstanding levels of comfort with a spacious seating configuration. Wider seats in both Business and Economy classes, the lowest twin engine noise level of any aircraft, advanced air conditioning technology and full LED mood lighting, all work together to enhance the comfort of passengers, while reducing fatigue after a long flight.
Qatar Airways now operates 47 passenger flights a week between the United States and Doha  daily from New York, Washington DC, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Dallas/ Fort Worth, and five flights a week from Miami. In addition to this, over the next few months, Qatar Airways US network will grow further with new routes Los Angeles (1st January 2016), Boston (16th March 2016), Atlanta (1st July 2016) and a second daily flight to New York from 1st March 2016.

Video: Litro Gas to purchase gas from European supplier
	
	Sri Lanka is to purchase gas from a European supplier under favorable conditions in accordance with a new contract which is being finalised in a week, local gas giant Litro Gas said today.
	Litro Gas Executive Chairman Shalila Moonasinghe told a media briefing that the old contract with Oman Trading International, a Middle East Based company, had ended on May 31. The previous contract he said was unfavorable towards the country as there were no provisions in the contract to demand an extra fee for supply delays and to file legal action. The most striking factor about the contract that just expired Mr. Moonasinghe said was that Sri lanka had to purchase a tonne of LPG at US $ 135 though the market rate was stagnant at US $ 110 for the last two years.
	Unfavourable deals such as these have contributed immensely to the staggering loss of Rupees one billion during the last two years, the Executive Chairman said, adding the company cannot assure further price reductions although the new contract brings cost savings as it would be essential to focus on reducing the staggering losses incurred during the last two years. But he also assured that there would be no price hikes in the near future, while adding that there was no shortage of gas in the country as they had enough supplies at the moment. He said a temporary shortage was created by some who had stocked gas, fearing such a shortage would occur.
	Meanwhile Mr. Moonasinghe accepted that the company was distributing free gas cylinders in some parts of Colombo as a promotion and said this would be expanded to other parts of the country as well.(Yohan Perera & Darshana Sanjeewa)
