BASL urges president to withdraw extension
	
The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) urged President Maithripala Sirisena to withdraw the extension of the previous government?s order to call out the armed forces in circumstances endangering public security where the police are inadequate to deal with such situations.
?
The BASL in a statement urged President Sirisena to review the situation and rescind the recent extension under the Public Security Ordinance or refrain from extending this Order when its validity period expires in three weeks? time. ?
President Maithripala Sirisena on February 2, extended for one month the operation of the previous Order made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Ex BBC producer to make film promoting reconciliation in SL
	
	A former BBC television producer is raising money to fund a film promoting reconciliation in Sri Lanka after decades of civil war.
	Chris Langdon, who lives in Lambolle Road, Belsize Park, recently returned from Sri Lanka having shot a trailer for? Healing The Wounds?, a film exploring the relationships between the country?s different communities since the war ended in 2009.
	The 57-year-old, who produced the reports of BBC world affairs editor John Simpson for years, is set to make the documentary with Croatian film-maker Daniel Ridicki over the course of the next year.
	On Wednesday, Mr. Langdon screened the trailer at a special fundraising talk at Belsize Community Library in Antrim Grove.
	He said: ?We were delighted with the political changes that have happened recently.
	?We want to take the window of opportunity to make a film that will help community groups reach out to other people in a process of reconciliation.?
	In May 2009, the Sri Lankan government defeated the Tamil Tigers, a military organisation fighting to create an independent state for the Tamil people, after a 26-year war.
	Last month, Maithripala Sirisena beat incumbent president Mahinda Rajapaksa, who had been in office for 10 years, in elections to become the new Sri Lankan president.
	Following these landmark events, Mr. Langdon insists the time was right for the documentary to be made.
	?There?s a great window of opportunity after we have had regime change and days later the Pope visited Sri Lanka and talked about healing wounds,? he explained.
	?We filmed with the Pope. I sat with all the war veterans with missing limbs as he came past them.?
	Mr. Langdon said the new president represented a fresh break from the old regime.?? ?
	?He wants to end corruption, start good governance and create a balanced economy,? said Mr Langdon. ?So a modest regime has a devout Buddhist president from a rural background. He managed to capture the mood of the Buddhist community.?
	As part of the documentary, Mr. Langdon and Mr. Ridicki plan to film among communities from all of the four main religions ? Islam, Christianity, Buddhism and Hinduism ? in Sri Lanka.
	?Essentially we will be bringing people from all communities together in the film to discuss what unites them and what divides them,? he said.
	?We will do it in a way that is attractive to watch and is right for a Sri Lankan audience.
	?I hope it creates a common space for conversation between the different communities in Sri Lanka so they can have a national conversation.?

Malinga to face NZ in World Cup opener
	
	Lasith Malinga is not 100 per cent fit but says he will play in the Cricket World Cup opener against New Zealand on Saturday.
	The Sri Lankan quick bowler has been battling back from an injury to his left ankle and has been out of the game for five months.
	Today he told international media that the lure of the World Cup meant he would put up with the discomfort and play in every game he was required to, including the tournament opener against the Black Caps in Christchurch.
	Malinga has bowled in the nets and though unsure of where his pace is at, he's happy with where he finds himself.
	"I'm feeling good, the rhythm is good and so is the run-up."
	The 31-year-old hopes to use Sri Lanka's two warm-up matches, against South Africa at Christchurch's Hagley Oval tomorrow and on Wednesday against Zimbabwe in Lincoln, as best he can to gain the match practice he's missed.
	Malinga was restricted to light duties and spectating over the seven-match ODI series which his side lost to New Zealand 4-2 , however, the veteran felt his experience would quickly make up for a lack of time in the middle.
	"My feeling is that I still have the mental preparation. Not the skill preparation, but I have been thinking about my game and I'm feeling good."
	Malinga has played 177 ODIs since making his debut in 2004.
	His bowling average is an impressive 27.21, but it's an even better 23.89 against New Zealand. In 21 ODIs against the Black Caps, Malinga has taken 29-wickets including a best of 4-28 in Colombo in 2009.(Stuff)

	The source said there were no plans to rename the Nelum Pokuna Performing Arts Theatre.(YP)

SLMC seeks joint administration in East
	
The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) today urged all political parties representing the Eastern Provincial Council to come together in forming a joint administration as it is in the central government.
SLMC Leader and Minister of Urban Development Rauff Hakeem told a media briefing that his party is ready to give ministerial portfolios in the Eastern Provincial Council to all parties representing the council including the United People Freedom Alliance (UPFA), United National Party (UNP) and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA).
Therefore he urged these parties to accept the portfolios. Mr. Hakeem said his party had already held discussions with these parties and was willing to engage in further dialogue with them.
However he regretted that TNA had not shown any flexibility in its stance with regard to the Eastern Provincial Council.
At the same time Mr. Hakeem thanked the TNA and other parties for allowing a chief Minister from his party to be sworn in for the province. He said the SLMC was not in a position to give the chief ministerial post to another party as the Muslims in the area had been on a stand that chief ministerial post should be given to a person from their community.
It was also mentioned that the decision on the number of portfolios given to each party would depend on the outcome of the discussions which the SLMC was to have with other parties. (YP)

Voted Reluctantly: Namal
	
	Hambantota UPFA MP Namal Rajapaksa said that he voted for the interim budget presented by the new government, with ?reluctance? because of concerns he had about the ?unsustainable nature of the proposals that have been presented?.
	?The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has taken a decision to vote for the interim budget presented by the new Government. In the interest of maintaining the integrity and unity of the Party, I have decided to stand with the Party decision,? Mr. Rajapaksa said in a statement.
	The second reading of the Interim Budget 2015 was passed in parliament on Saturday evening with a majority of 163 votes cast in favour.
	A total of 164 votes were cast in favour of the interim budget proposals while only one vote had been cast against it by Democratic National Alliance (DNA) MP Ajith Kumara.The full statement:RELUCTANT VOTE FOR THE BUDGET
	The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has taken a decision to vote for the interim budget presented by the new Government. In the interest of maintaining the integrity and unity of the Party, I have decided to stand with the Party decision. However, I do so with reluctance because of concerns I have about the unsustainable nature of the proposals that have been presented.
	Consider, for example, the reduction in the prices of petrol, diesel, LP gas, and kerosene. Fuel reductions are generally welcome measures. However, though it would appear to be an immediate relief to the public, the extent of the reduction in fuel prices, unfortunately, are unlikely to be sustainable in the long run and could have an immensely negative impact on the overall economy. Even though global oil prices were low at the time the present Government decreased fuel prices, this past week, crude prices have seen a marked increase. How sustainable this price reduction will be is the concern. While it may be easy to please the public in the short-term with such measures, such ad-hoc decisions are more likely to have a negative long-term impact on the country?s economy and thus the everyday lives of ordinary citizens.
	Another concern is the extent to which the Government has decided to increase salaries. We agree in principle with the need to increase salaries. In fact, it was former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who first proposed the increase of salaries and pensions in the 2015 National Budget that he presented last year. However, the new administration has amplified the salary hike to a level that will not be sustainable, once again.
	There are also a number of concerns with regard to proposals pertaining to the agricultural sector as well. First, even though the Government has proposed a guaranteed price of Rs. 50/kg for paddy, it will be difficult to secure that price with the low prices of wheat flour and bread. Additionally, considering the duty free imports for products like green gram, dry fish and other grain varieties, there will be a negative impact for farmers of these agricultural products. The bottom line is that these budget proposals will almost definitely hurt the local farmers, not help them.
	Then there is the Rs. 1 billion tax imposed on casinos and sports-related television channels. How was this taxation amount decided? What is the basis? While we completely agree with imposing any amount of tax on casinos, what is the logic behind imposing the same tax on types of businesses that generate vastly different ranges of profit? Furthermore, doesn?t the imposition of taxes on casinos imply regulation of that industry? Didn?t this administration propose the shutting down of all casinos in the country? The public needs to be aware of this double standard that is being practiced by the current administration.
	There are further concerns on how taxation will impact investors and the private sector overall. Sri Lanka?s business community has already expressed great dissatisfaction at the super gains tax that has been included in the interim budget. Although justifications are being made for this tax, citing short-term revenue needs, it sets a very dangerous precedent, one that will make it acceptable to penalize successful businesses every time the government sees the need to generate short-term revenue. Furthermore, should successful businesses in the country be punished for being efficient and producing good returns? It is certain to scare away any potential investors from even considering Sri Lanka to set up a new venture.
	While there are a number of other worrying aspects about the proposed budget, the one other aspect I would like to point out here is the reduction in the prices of essential items that was much hyped-about leading up to the presentation of the budget. However, other than perhaps flour, sugar and milk powder, the products chosen for this reduction in prices was a big letdown to the public.
	I stand with the new Government?s claims that the budget must provide relief to those that are less fortunate, to those who are finding it difficult to provide for their families. It is crucially important for us to help our fellow Sri Lankans lift themselves out of poverty. Those who have been fortunate enough to profit can be asked to withstand more of a burden on behalf of the society at large. But unfortunately, it seems very obvious that this budget was prepared to please the public with impending elections in mind, with short-sighted proposals that are more appropriate for a 100-day programme rather than the entire year that national budgets should be targeted towards.
	It is my hope that the strength of the economy that was maintained during the past nearly two decades will be adequate to rectify these short-term negative effects.
