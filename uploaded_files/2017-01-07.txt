Daily Mail/AFP/6 January 2017- Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri has denounced what he said was a dishonest propaganda campaign by rival jihadist group the Islamic State against his organization, in an audio message released Thursday. ??
In the message found and translated by US-based watchdog the SITE Intelligence Group, the Egyptian extremist accuses IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi of slandering his group. ??
Al-Qaeda, founded by the late Osama Bin Laden, is locked in a battle with the so-called Islamic State -- which sprang from its Iraqi faction -- for the leadership of a global jihad. ??
In his message, the 65-year-old Zawahiri complained that Al-Baghdadi had alleged that Al-Qaeda opposes sectarian attacks on Shiites and was prepared to work with Christian leaders.?

Mourning the loss of a guiding light
	
?
?
We mourn the loss of world renowned judge Justice Weeramantry who passed away on Thursday evening. Perhaps, he felt it was the right time to part after profound 90 years of service to humanity. Yet, to those who were near and dear to him, to those who cherished every single second in his presence, his departure was too early. But the world order is given and we cannot escape reality. C.G. will certainly be guided by the angels, with soothing songs, in his journey to the heavens. Let us say our goodbyes to the greatest man of peace in our time, by recollecting some of his great works for humanity. ??
Judge Weeramantry was undoubtedly one of the most distinguished and respected jurists in the world. His judgments and opinions expressed in various publications, lectures and keynotes at both local and international fora bear testimony to his erudite scholarship and extraordinary ability to interpret the underlying philosophy of legal principles, congruent with the teachings of global religious and cultural wisdom. ??
C.G. was the very first jurist to communicate religious teachings to the judgments of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). In many of his publications, C.G. argued that this notion needed more acceptance to ensure peaceful co-existence of all religious and cultural groups. ??
At the ICJ, Judge Weeramantry derived obligations and legal principles from religious and cultural wisdom, and advocated that international adjudication needed more alignment internationally. He therefore extracted and interpreted these cultural notions in his rulings. In many of his opinions, C.G. not only quoted from the rich repositories of Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity, but also highlighted the traditions and customs of the Aborigines, Maoris and Incas. ??
His outstanding contributions to international justice and peace were ?recognised by the City of Hague in 1998, at the time it celebrated its ?750th ?anniversary. Eighteen areas in which the city excelled over the 750 years were chosen and individuals recognised in these areas. Hence, it was Judge Weeramantry who was chosen as the most prominent personality to have contributed to international justice. Accordingly, a booklet was published on the 18 personalities selected and their contributions exhibited for a month at the city hall. ??
Justice Weeramantry always feared the outbreak of a nuclear war. Needless to say the world is not strong enough to undergo such devastation. ??
When the UN General Assembly appealed to the ICJ for an opinion on the legality of the use or threat of nuclear weapons, C.G. made a dissenting opinion to condemn nuclear weapons outright, and considered this act totally illegal in all circumstances. Henceforth, his opinion is regarded as a leading exposition of the illegality of nuclear weapons, and its resultant environmental damage to current and future generations for thousands of years to come. ??
More often than not, it is C.G.?s authority that is cited when concerns of illegality and environmental damage caused by nuclear weapons table for discussion. In August 2016, a special session was held in Japan where Justice Weeramantry was invited to be the Chief Guest to commemorate the judgment on the use of nuclear weapons. ??
With regards to the environment, C.G. has rendered yeoman service to highlight the significance of environmental law as a rapidly-developing branch of international law. In the words of Professor Philippe Sands, Global Professor of Law at the New York University School of Law: ?Judge Christopher Weeramantry has made a singular contribution to the development of modern environmental law... If international environmental law has been ?mainstreamed,? then, much of the credit must go to Judge Weeramantry.? ??
C.G. has also written on the teachings regarding the environment of Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity and Islam. One such masterpiece is his book ?Tread Lightly on the Earth: Religion, The Environment and the Human Future.? ??
In May 2016, Judge Weeramantry was chosen to deliver the keynote address on the occasion to commemorate the 800th year of Magna Carta. He was also emeritus Professor of several universities worldwide. ??
Erudite Weeramantry never failed to take the maximum out of his prowess. He wrote two pioneering works on the legal content of Islam and Christianity, referring to the specific teachings related to trusteeship of the environment. The books ?Islamic Jurisprudence: An International Perspective? and ?The Lord?s Prayer; Bridge to a Better World? stand tribute to this. ??
The United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) appointed Judge Weeramantry as the Chairman of a committee of judges to draft a manual of international environmental law for the use of the personnel of the judiciary worldwide. This was necessitated by the fact that many judges were now called upon by their domestic jurisdictions to decide matters in the developing area of environmental law and often did so without any knowledge on the latest developments in the subject area. ??
When the US celebrated its bicentennial anniversary in 1976, a world congress was held on Equality and Freedom - the underlying themes of the US Constitution. Three presentations on equality and freedom were arranged from the standpoints of the western, communist and third world, and Judge Weeramantry was invited to make the presentation for the third world. His speech was serialised in various journals including The Asiaweek and Christian Science Monitor, and was described by a reader of Asiaweek of April 15, 1977 as ?A Magna Carta for the Third World.? ??
C.G. has also been a pioneer in seeking to prevent the enormous powers of modern science and technology from damaging the environment. Outstanding futurist Sir Arthur C. Clarke often described C.G. as ?The prophet of the space age.? In his foreword to Judge Weeramantry?s work in protecting human rights in the age of technology, he observed: ??
?This monumental work deserves a wide readership, because it is concerned with nothing less than the survival of humanity and necessity of making the right use of the awesome new powers that science and technology has given us... So I am happy to see Judge Weeramantry outlining many of the steps that must be taken if we are not to follow the dinosaurs into oblivion.? ??
No more need to be said to highlight the calibre of this gentleman, or even to establish his pre-eminence as a scholar and jurist. He is a man who has done his outmost for the sustainable development and protection of the environment for many generations to come. Sadly, the world has lost a guiding light. ??

No doubt Russia interfered in election : US intel chief
	
?
Brushing aside Donald Trump?s dismissiveness, the nation?s intelligence chief insisted Thursday that U.S. agencies are more confident than ever that Russia interfered in America?s recent presidential election. And he called the former Cold War foe an ?existential threat? to the nation. ??
Did Russian hacking sway the results? There?s no way for U.S. agencies to know, said James Clapper, the director of national intelligence. ??
Asked about the possible effect of the disclosure of private information stolen by hackers, Clapper said, ?The intelligence community can?t gauge the impact it had on the choices the electorate made.? But he did say Russian hacking ?did not change any vote tallies.? ? ?Clapper?s testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee was short on concrete evidence of Russian activities, but it raised the stakes in the intelligence community?s standoff with Trump. Clapper indicated the agencies he leads would not back down in their assessment, even if that threatens a prolonged crisis of confidence with their next commander in chief. ? ?That puts the pressure back on Trump, who has raised the possibility of more positive relations with Russia and has repeatedly disparaged the U.S. intelligence agencies. He will be briefed Friday on the classified evidence concerning Russian interference. ?
Shortly after Thursday?s hearing, news leaked that Trump would soon name former Republican Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana to replace Clapper after the new president takes office. ?
That puts the pressure back on Trump, who has raised the possibility of more positive relations with Russia and has repeatedly disparaged the U.S. intelligence agencies. He will be briefed Friday on the classified evidence concerning Russian interference. ?

Osama bin Laden?s son Hamza has been designated a terrorist
	
Daily Mail/5 January 2017- ??
One of Osama bin Laden?s sons has been designated a terrorist by the United States. ??
On Thursday, the U.S. State Department added Hamza bin Laden, believed to be in his mid 20s, to its list of global terrorists after confirming he had followed in his father?s footsteps to join al Qaeda. ??
Al Qaeda senior leader Ayman al-Zawahiri released a tape in August 2015, claiming that Hamza had joined the group. In the audio message, Hamza himself spoke and called for lone wolf attacks in Washington, DC, Paris and Tel Aviv. ??
He issued another audio message this past July, calling for ?revenge against the United States?. The message specifically called on ?Saudi Arabian-based tribes to unite with al Qaeda?s affiliate in Yemen to wage war against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia? - an ally of the U.S. ??
Being added to the U.S.?s counter-terrorism blacklist involves economic sanctions that prevents people on the list from doing business with American citizens and holding funds in U.S.-based bank accounts. ??

President rejects foreign judges
	
In the wake of the Consultative Task Force calling for foreign judges to hear war crime charges, a government minister said yesterday that President Maithripala Sirisena categorically ruled out the participation of foreign judges to hear or inquire into war crime allegations.
Addressing a hurriedly called press conference at the President?s House, State Minister of Finance Lakshman Yapa Abeywardene reaffirmed the President's position. He said only logistical and IT assistance would be obtained to expedite the judicial process, when the judicial mechanism was set up to probe the alleged crimes.
Responding to journalists on the suggestions that had been made by the Consultative Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanism to include foreign judges in the judicial process that is to probe war crimes, Minister Yapa said President Sirisena was very clear on this matter and added he has more than once said there will be no foreign judges in the local judicial mechanism and it will not be a hybrid court as suggested by certain groups.
?President Sirisena and the government have full confidence in our judiciary, legal process and judges. We have extremely eminent and experienced judges and our judges have served in various countries and global organizations that have given much credit to the country.
Minister Yapa said Sri Lanka expects to submit a progress report to the UNHRC in March and explain the measures take by the unity government to promote reconciliation, rule of law, inter communal harmony and strengthen democratic institutions and the concept of good governance.
Sri Lanka?s Constitution or the Criminal Procedure Code do not provide for the establishment of a judicial mechanism with foreign judges to adjudicate alleged war crimes. As such the issue of establishing a so-called Hybrid Court does not arise and the government?s intention was to establish a credible domestic mechanism comprising of our own judges, acceptable to the local and global community.
?The government under no circumstances will target war heroes, field commanders of the three armed forces or the political leadership for war crime charges or haul them before a court or tribunal. But we have to deal with those if there are any, who have violated the International Humanitarian Law on an individual level,? he stressed. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Visakha to mark 100 years of excellence
	
?
Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo will mark its 100th milestone this year, with several programmes lined up throughout to proudly declare a century of providing sound education as well as opportunities to pursue extra-curricular activities.
Visakha Vidyalaya has remained a most sought-after education institution for many years, and as the school which requires the highest marks for entry through the Grade 5 Scholarship examination.?
The school also takes pride in having the maximum number of achievers and the highest scorers at the GCE Ordinary Level and Advanced Level examinations, especially in the Bio-Science stream with the largest number of girls entering medical faculties.?
Apart from traditional careers, Visakhians hold top positions and are performing well in other non-traditional professions in various sectors; becoming visionaries in their own fields both here and abroad. Visakha thus has its reasons to vividly commemorate 100 years of excellence.?
The first major fund raiser in the exciting line up of events for the year is the ?Visakha Centenary Walk 2017.? Organised by the Visakha Vidyalaya Old Girls? Association, jointly with the School Development Committee, the walk will be held on February 11. Starting from the school premises at 7.30 a.m., it will proceed along Vajira ?Road, Galle Road; turn to Bauddhaloka Mawatha at the Bambalapitiya junction and to Havelock ?Road at Thunmulla and back to school via Vajira ?Road. On return to the school, a mini- carnival will add more glamour at the school premises with food and beverages as well as DJ music to keep the crowd toe-tapping until 1.00 ?p.m.?
The proceeds of the walk will be exclusively channelled towards the construction of the new building for the primary school. The proposed three-storey building would enable Grade 3 and 4 classes - currently located within the senior school - to be housed along with the rest of the primary classes, bringing the primary school to one single location. A pavilion will also be included in the ground floor of the building. The primary building, one of the most ambitious projects undertaken by the Visakha Vidyalaya Old Girls? Association, will be a centennial gift to their Alma Mater.?
Apart from the walk, the first programme that marks the school?s 100th successful year is the Bodhi Pooja on January 16, which is officially the school?s date of birth. On January 21, an alms-giving for 100 Bhikkunis will be held at the school premises. A special Commemorative Coin will also be launched at a ceremony.?
Further, an educational exhibition is scheduled for March. The second major fund-raiser for the year (apart from the walk), will be the Visakha Carnival that will take place on April 7 and 8. It is expected to be a grander version of the traditional Avurudu Pola that takes place in the school annually. A campfire will be held for past and present girl guides in August while the Visakha Geetha Natakaya will be held in October.?
The progress of the school over the years and the prestige it enjoys today as an outstanding seat of learning in the country are indeed a fitting tribute to the founder, the farsighted and philanthropic Mrs. Jeremias Dias, who envisioned the need to educate girls in the Buddhist way of life through this institution. Visakha continues to flourish at the forefront of girls? education in Sri Lanka, 100 years on.?
