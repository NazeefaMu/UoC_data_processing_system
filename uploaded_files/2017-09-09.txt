Admission to Prisons Hospital: Ministry orders strict criteria
	
It has been made mandatory with immediate effect that any prison inmate seeking admission to the prisons hospital will have to get the consent of three doctors, Prison Reforms Minister D.M. Swaminathan said yesterday.
Minister Swaminathan said following complaints received by several parties alleging misconduct and favours granted to special political inmates, the ministry had ordered Prisons Commissioner General H.M.N.C.Dhanasinghe to make mandatory the consent of three prison doctors.
According to the order, special consent of the doctor in charge at the Prisons and the OPD doctor would be sought while the ward doctor has to diagnose and recommend the inmate for in-house treatment.
"The diagnose reports should be submitted to the Ministry for further investigations by the ministry," he said.
Ministry Spokesperson Dumidu Bandara told the Daily Mirror that the measure was taken with the intention of preventing unnecessary admissions of political and high profile inmates to the Prisons Hospital. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

At least five dead as massive 8.1 magnitude earthquake strikes off the coast of Mexico
	
?
At least five have been killed including two children after a massive 8.1 earthquake struck off the south coast of Mexico triggering a tsunami. ?
The earthquake was felt across Mexico, toppling houses and shaking buildings in the country?s capital amid reports tremors were detected as a far away as Austin, Texas - more than 1,300 miles from the epicentre. ?
A tsunami has already been detected in Mexico after the quake struck at 11.49pm last night, 76 miles southwest of the town of Pijijiapan, at a depth of 43 miles. ?
Terrified residents in Mexico City ran out into the streets after the quake struck, witnesses said. Tremors were stronger than a devastating earthquake in 1985 that hit the capital flattening swathes of the city and killing thousands. The US Tsunami Warning System said widespread hazardous tsunami waves were possible within the next three hours on the Pacific coasts of several central American countries - Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, Ecuador and Honduras. ??
Seismologists have warned of a tsunami of more than 12 ft. As far as 8700 miles away in the Philippines, the national disaster agency put the country?s entire eastern seaboard on alert. ??

Douglas Gunesekera: Living in an epochal transition
	
?
100th Birthday Commemoration August 12
?
Douglas Gunasekera (1917), was an Economist and administrator in the realms of Public Banking and Finance. When in the Treasury, he was the Secretary of the Committee whose Report in 1949 was the base and foundation for the Central Bank.?
In the Central Bank, Douglas started, by preference as Chief Accountant, an apolitical post.
He was very proud of the Central Bank which he left after becoming Deputy Governor.?
Three key features he keenly placed in and safeguarded were firstly that it should be the place of best research (intellectual meant research to him). So such persons should have ?cradle to grave? security. Then that it should be independent within the nationalist tenure of the time. So the Central Bank notes were signed by the Minister of Finance as well as the Governor.?
Further, the Central Bank was set up under a Monetary Board, the classic principles of a Currency Board, as safeguarding the international value of money was its central role.
The Government had two very different advisors from whom to choose the first Governor.?
Douglas worked closely with both. One was John Exter an American Academic from Harvard, who was later a Gold Bug Right Wing Economist in the US.?
The other was Cyril Hawker, from the Bank of England, who later combined the Standard and Chartered Banking Groups and N. M. Rothschild to create a powerful Bank in London.?
The Government chose Exter.
The Korean War was an unexpected event. It forced a massive use of natural rubber in the transport of US troops. Rubber prices soared. In Asia, the British Malay States and independent Ceylon benefited. Unlike in Malaya, Ceylon wished to spend the sudden riches on expenditure. Governor Exter supported this, calling it a windfall. It ended the Bank?s profile of independence and brought in a new Profligacy to national policy and politics.
In 1958, Douglas was Sri Lanka?s Director/ alternate director at the World Bank/IMF sharing offices with Japan, India and Burma. The Malay States and British Africa were not yet independent. Japan and India led a group of large Asian countries to form a Development Bank of their own feelings.?
Douglas, who had several negotiations as with China, was chosen as Secretary of the Group and made Manager of the project. The Asian Development Bank was its result.
The key aspect was to give the economic reality of Asia an expression, unlike the Washington institutions? view. Douglas suffered many privations in the creation stage but he delivered, placing in similar key aspects as for the Central Bank and also a slim chain of executive action from a Japanese President through an Indian Vice President to him as Secretary. After a clear run of five to six years, however, the financial powers, America and Europe and allies, began the painful process of taking the ADB back with Douglas playing a role in keeping some spirit of ?the revolution? alive. Looking back, Douglas was very proud of the Asian Development Bank.
For the ADB, as with many UN institutions as UN-HABITAT, UNDP, UNIDO, the early views and ambitions of the founders had to give way to the Economic and Political realities of our times. There are no Islands of Paradise. Though in Douglas? phrase, ?there can be Gilded Cages.?
Once retired from each institution, Douglas did not go back. He went on in what his mind and circumstance mattered. But he reflected increasingly. He could see that he had lived in a very stirring time. When a people, the colonial under class people, went through an epochal change, which is still ongoing.
The certainties of every moment soon turned to dust. And he could see through it. A philosophy of seeing the past happily but truthfully came to reside in him. But there was less and less one could discuss except with certain friends.
An active intellectual mind wants to discuss the present not with the sentiments of the past but with the clarity from experience. He needed friends who could rise above the present.
Such is a long and active life. As one epoch transmutes the next, Power is the intellect?s final challenge. Being active, Douglas could see a great deal. He was too close to the highs and lows to want to truthfully write about the subjects. But many came to chat. For them, time had made understanding easier and clearer.

Mr. Weeratunga was ordered to pay Rs.50 million as compensation to the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC) after he was found guilty of misappropriating Rs.600 million of its funds to distribute 'sil redi' during the 2015 presidential election campaign.
The MP told Daily Mirror a meeting was to be held last night at Sunethradevi Pirivena in Pepiliyana to launch this programme. (Kelum Bandara)

HINDUSTAN TIMES, 8 September, 2017 - ?Pakistan has made great sacrifices in fighting terror and has a clear conscience, China said on Friday, barely five days after Beijing joined other Brics members in condemning the terror groups operating from that country. ??
China?s message of support came during a joint press conference foreign minister Wang Yi addressed with his visiting Pakistani counterpart Khwaja Muhammad Asif. ??
Some countries should recognise Pakistan?s great sacrifices, Wang said. ??
?Pakistan is an important participant in fight against global terrorism,? Pakistan?s Geo News quoted him as saying. ??
Leaders of the five Brics countries ? Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa ? who met for a summit in China?s port city of Xiamen on September 8, identified Pakistan-based terror outfits Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed among groups causing violence and security concerns, bracketing them with Islamic State. ??

President's committee on SAITM nullifies SLMC powers
	
The Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) yesterday charged that the committee appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena on the SAITM issue was attempting to nullify the powers of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) in order to establish a separate institution to regulate medical education called the Accreditation Council (AC).
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that the government was trying to legalize the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) through the establishment of such an institute.
?Even though President Sirisena is doing his best to solve the SAITM issue, several external forces are trying to sabotage his efforts. We notice that there are some pro-SAITM parties in the committee which was appointed by the President,? he added.
He said that the GMOA would not allow any force to nullify the powers of the SLMC and added that they would take stern actions with regard to it in the future.
Meanwhile, GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Naveen De Soyza said that the committee appointed by President Sirisena on the SAITM issue does not include a representative of the SLMC, despite it being the main authority to monitor medical education in the country.
?The government is attempting to establish an alternative regulatory body to take over the powers of the SLMC to be known as the Accreditation Council (AC) to regulate medical education in order to legalise the SAITM,? he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Prevailing rains to increase today
	
The prevailing rains were likely to increase today and continue for few more days because of the lower level atmospheric disturbance in the Bay of Bengal, the Department of Meteorology said yesterday.
It said showers or thundershowers would occur at times in the Western, Southern, Sabaragamuwa, Central and North-Western Provinces.

HINDUSTAN TIMES, 8 September, 2017 - ?It was the fast-flowing river that doomed the inhabitants of Tula Toli. ??
Snaking around the remote village on three sides, the treacherous waters allowed Burmese soldiers to corner and hold people on the river?s sandy banks. Some were shot on the spot. Others drowned in the current as they tried to escape. ??
Zahir Ahmed made a panicked dash for the opposite bank, where he hid in thick jungle and watched his family?s last moments. ??
?I was right next to the water,? he recalled in an interview a week later at a refugee camp in neighbouring Bangladesh, his eyes bloodshot and his shirt stained with sweat and dirt.More than 160,000 of Myanmar?s 1.1 million ethnic Rohingya minority have fled to Bangladesh, bringing with them stories that they say describe ethnic cleansing. ??
Those who escaped fled to the hills in the west to make the three-day trek to Myanmar?s border with Bangladesh. The rest were buried in a mass grave, villagers said. ??

Some PTL purchases reflected only in internal documents
	
Cross examining PTL CEO Kasun Palisena on the costs of sale of Bond purchases, Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunathilake said yesterday most of the purchases reflected as PTL?s expenses in their documents were unreliable because neither any payment nor security movements with other parties were reflected in the CBSL recording systems or in PTL's accounts held at commercial banks.
PTL had earlier provided a set of documents disputing the calculation made earlier by Central Bank's IT Additional Director K.V.K. Alwis on the company's capital gains.
PTL had provided a set of documents on their bond purchases during 2015 and 2016 to disprove Mr. Alwis? calculation.
Some of them included government securities bought by PTL from connected companies such as Perpetual Capital Holdings and W.M. Mendis & Company and bond purchases from some other individuals.
Presenting a sample of expenses reflected in the PTL documents, DSG Gunathilake was of the view that the payments and the security movement should be reflected in the CB recording systems (RTGS and LSS) if PTL had been involved in such purchases, but however, it was revealed that none of those transactions were reflected in the CB recording systems.
DSG Gunathilake was of the view that theses purchases cannot be regarded as costs incurred by PTL because they were only reflected in its internal book entries.
After a series of questions by the Commissioners and the DSG, PTL CEO Palisena explained that the PTL purchases from PCH and WM Mendis & Company may not have been reflected in the CB recording systems if parties were involved in ?netting off? transactions which happens when settling credits with each other.
However, the Commission seemed unsatisfied with the explanation provided by the witness.
It was also revealed yesterday that PTL had prepared the documentation works relating to those internal transactions with its internal companies. This was revealed when DSG Gunathilake played a voice recording which showd one of PTL?s dealers asking Perpetual Capital Holding (PCH) Finance Manager to obtain PCH?s letter heads to conclude transactions.
It was also revealed that PTL owner Arjun Aloysius was the ultimate beneficiary owner of PTL and had confirmed all the bond purchases.
DSG Gunathilake was of the view that the documents provided by PTL to the PCoI to show their cost of sales and dispute the previous calculation by CBSL with regard to PTL?s capital gains should have given all the necessary details to prove their purchases.
DSG Gunathilake will continue cross examining PTL CEO Kasun Palisena on Monday and Nihal Fernando PC will re-examine the witness on Tuesday. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Take a Minute- Change a Life
	
?
The World Health Organisation (WHO) claims that more lives are lost due to suicide than both war and homicide combined.?
More than 1 million people take their lives every year.
Such alarming statistics signal to one thing ? prevention of suicide is an extremely important and urgent issue that needs to be addressed by society as a whole.
?
?
September 10 is marked as World Suicide Prevention Day and it has been so ever since its successful launch in September 2003.?
Suicide is one of the main causes of untimely and unnecessary deaths the world over, and a special day has been ear marked to create public awareness so that more can be done to minimise, if not completely prevent, suicides in the world.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) claims that more lives are lost due to suicide than both war and homicide combined.?
More than 1 million people take their lives every year. One life is lost every 40 seconds due to suicide across the world and over 20 times this amount attempt to take their lives.?
Behind each of these grim statistics is a person who couldn?t find anything worthwhile to live for and have questioned the value of their own lives.?
?
Well-trained and dedicated volunteers work at ten befriending centres across the island. They are located in Kandy, Bandarawela, Panadura, Matale, Panduvasnuwara, Mawanella, Negombo, Kurunegala, Kohuwela and Jaffna.
?
?
These numbers speak of individual stories of loneliness, depression and hopelessness.
Such alarming statistics signal to one thing ? prevention of suicide is an extremely important and urgent issue that needs to be addressed by society as a whole.?
It is the sense of belonging that comes from being a part of a community and a network of friends, family and caring individuals that helps abate the negative feeling that lead to suicide. In a world where ?connection? is obtained through electronic means via the internet and social media, the aspect and true connectivity with another human being is largely lost.?
As a society we are fast losing our ability to reach out to people and connect with them, which causes isolation and depression leading to suicide. It is only through communities, volunteer and other organisations, medical professionals all working in tandem that these bonds can be re-established.?
The participation of the community and society is integral in this fight to save lives and the theme for this year?s Suicide Prevention Day ?Take a minute to change a life? encapsulates this.
The International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP) the WHO, Befrienders? World Wide (BW) and voluntary befriending organisations in about 70 countries in the world are engaged in making a big contribution towards preventing/minimising the incidence of suicide in the world.
In Sri Lanka for 43 long years Sri Lanka Sumithrayo, which is a Government-approved charity, and incorporated by an Act of Parliament No 10 of 1986, has been silently and unobtrusively providing the emotional support required by people, who are suicidal and despairing.?
Well-trained and dedicated volunteers work at ten befriending centres across the island. They are located in Kandy, Bandarawela, Panadura, Matale, Panduvasnuwara, Mawanella, Negombo, Kurunegala, Kohuwela and Jaffna.
The Rural outreach covers more than 110 villages in Panduvasnuwara, Lunugamvehera and Ambalantota every day of the week, 365 days of the year at no cost, to alleviate the misery, loneliness and despair of persons going through personal crises and or are in imminent danger of taking their own lives.
Many do not truly wish to take their own lives. It is often the ultimate expression of the hopelessness and the isolation felt.?
People think of suicide as a release or escape from the unbearable pain and agony they feel, and their inability to cope with the overwhelming emotional stress.?
Not having someone close enough to share their innermost feelings, perhaps due to shame or fear of being judged, feeling isolated and having none to turn to could make such an individual perceive death as the only option.?
Each one of these individuals who feel that way is a part of a family, a network of friends and a society. Therefore, the prevention of suicide is everyone?s responsibility
Each member of society has a role to play in the fight to prevent unnecessary deaths. It is as simple as individuals reaching out to those that maybe struggling and offering a kind word of support and a non-judgemental ear and the media reporting and televising suicide related matters in more sensitive and appropriate manner without making light of an individual?s feelings or circumstance.?
The minute you take to offer a gentle word of support or acknowledgement might make a difference between life and death.
?Take a minute-Change a life? Talking helps and listening heals. There?s help. Talk to Sri Lanka Sumithrayo in total confidence.

There weren?t enough tears to wash away all the sorrow
	
A good father is one of the most unsung, unpraised, unnoticed and yet one of the most valuable assets in our society?
- Billy Graham
When I was entrusted with the task of writing in memoriam of my father, I wondered if I would be able to do this wonderful person justice as to me it seemed impossible to sum up the remembrance of him to a few paragraphs.?
I doubted I would be able to contain all the emotions I was trying so hard to bottle up and get on with life; for in a society such as ours what choice do we have. Due to this reason I kept coming up with excuses to postpone the task and tried to justify it to my mother.?
However, it dawned upon me one night while I was reminiscing my wonderful childhood and the years gone by, that postponing this further was a lapse on my part, no matter what the reason behind it was.?
On the 5th of June this year my beloved father bade us farewell. There aren?t enough tears that could wash away all the sorrow that overcomes me when I realise that such a wonderful human being and the back bone of our family is no more.
Hailing from a middle class family Leslie Sherington Wickramasinghe was born on the January 14, 1943 to Pudias Wickramasinghe, a Station Master during the British Colonial Era and Nancy Wickramasinghe.?
He was the eighth child in a family of ten and the seventh son. Despite losing his father at the tender age of three and a childhood that saw its share of hardship, he was never one to give up in life. A trait he carried successfully till the end of his days.?
As the youngest child in the family I knew my father to be a strong, multi-talented and successful man who was well established; a hero to many and an individual highly respected by all.?
I did not see his initial struggles in life nor the hardships he faced supporting a wife and two young daughters while climbing the ladder, earning respect and a good reputation because of the precision in his work and dedication. Not everyone is lucky enough to have a father like him not only because he was a brilliant Surgeon who worked with great devotion to his cause in saving lives and ensuring his patients received his undivided care but also because as a father he gave us an upbringing which kept us in touch with reality, taught us the value of earning our accomplishments and the importance of taking responsibility for our actions.?
He always told us that money is not everything and that integrity and respect earned in society outweighed all material riches.
If he did not approve of something he never hesitated to express it and if someone had disappointed or betrayed his trust he did not feel the need to hide his dissatisfaction. He was a man of generally good judgement and although we failed to see it then, his judgement on good or bad affiliations have proved to be of great accuracy to this day.
?No matter whom it was or how a person had wronged him; there was never a day I heard him say that anyone deserved whatever wrong had come upon them. He was not a revengeful man and believed that natural justice would take its course. Being an extremely devoted son he never neglected his duties towards his mother and carried a deep sense of gratitude and love towards her to his last days.
If there ever was a reason that could create an enemy out of my father; it was an attempt to harm his family. He was our defender and our protector.
After retirement and away from the stress of service at the National Hospital we began to see a much more laid back and relaxed side to my strict disciplinarian father. He began to really enjoy life and it was a great disappointment when he suffered a fall resulting in a fracture in 2008.?
I will never forget the look of concern and worry in his eyes on his way to the hospital and although he said very little, his expression was easy to read for those who knew him well enough.?
That was a turning point and from then on it was with extreme difficulty that we watched the once active and energetic man gradually slow down over the years. He was however a fighter and through many medical ups and downs managed to recover even when some medical experts seemed to give up hope.?
He was a great example of someone who loved life despite whatever the situation and never lost the will to live, no matter what obstacles life threw his way. Even in the hardest of times his was a spirit that could not be broken.
He would wait eagerly every evening for me to get back home after work and never ran out of topics to exchange information with me, be it regarding politics, current affairs or our mutual love of music.
He would give me his opinion on all life?s decisions and advise me in the best way possible. Rest assured, most of that advice has proved to be the most sensible advice I have ever received.
On the Wednesday before he was hospitalized, I came home after work and after having our usual evening chat he told me that I don?t hug him anymore like I used to. I hugged him tight and neither of us had to say a word. It was as if time stood still. We had both fallen asleep and I woke up about an hour later to find him asleep hugging me tight.
He was rushed to hospital on Monday morning and was back to normal within a few hours. We were told he could be discharged in the evening. The consultants? follow up inspection did not happen till two days later and the days that followed are probably the worst and most traumatic days in my life and those I avoid looking back on.
This task entrusted was indeed one that I hoped I would never have to face. It is one that given the choice, each and every one of us would avoid till the end of our days. However, as time flies by we have to face the inevitable truth. Those we love will one day part from us.
My father was a man who left his mark on the world. He was an asset to our country and to his profession. His service was always tireless. Especially during the 90s, when Sri Lanka was severely affected by the civil war and many bomb blasts. Efforts towards ensuring that those affected were given prompt and the best care possible remained his priority. His care didn?t stop at the hospital and he managed to save me and restore me back to health while keeping me in the comfort of our home when I fell victim to dengue fever.?
Time revealed that his role as a husband and father and his responsibilities towards his family which he never neglected were those that were most appreciated. This also carried a valuable lesson for every one of us.?
When he left us that day, he left behind a family that will carry him in their hearts and grieve his loss till the end of their days.
-Beloved daughter Sheahana Wickramasinghe

?Like moths to a flame,? coalition spokesperson Army Col. Ryan S. Dillon told the military publication Stars and Stripes. ??

At least 300 ISIS militants and about as many women and children have been marooned in the Syrian desert over the past 10 days, who were seeking passage out of an enclave on the Lebanon-Syria border after surrendering and brokering a deal with the Lebanese Shi?ite militant group Hezbollah. ??
But the United States, quickly marshaled coalition forces to halt their progress, and began targeting routes and roadways to extremist-held areas farther east. ?
