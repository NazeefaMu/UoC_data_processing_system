Mr. Wickremesinghe recalled that Pope Francis visited Sri Lanka in January .
D.M. Swaminathan, Minister for Resettlement, Reconstruction and Hindu Religious Affairs, said the visit of the acharya is likely in September.

Lankan charged in US for seeking sex with underage girl
	
A 23-year-old Sri Lankan was charged for attempted sexual encounter with an underage girl he met via Craigslist in US.
Shabeeb Ahamed Mohamed Shaheed was charged Wednesday with one count of traveling to meet a minor, one count of use of computer for solicitation of a minor, and one count of attempted lewd or lascivious battery.
He had traveled by taxi to Starbucks on Palm Bay Road in hopes of having a sexual encounter with an underage girl he met via Craigslist, said Yvonne Martinez, Palm Bay police spokeswoman.
Instead, police officers arrested him: The "girl" he had been repeatedly emailing and texting was an undercover detective with the department's Special Victims Unit.
Shaheed remains incarcerated at the Brevard County Jail Complex, and his bond was set at $85,000.
"Mr. Shaheed thought he was talking to a girl under the age of 16 and in his communications with her he validated several times that he knew her age," Det. Ursula Cowan stated in a press release.
"He was very specific with what he wanted to do with her, and based on the evidence we gathered we were able to support probable cause for these charges," Cowan stated.(Florida Today)

Majority of Tamil refugees not willing to return: Minister
	
Only 35 per cent of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees living in Tamil Nadu are willing to come back, D.M. Swaminathan, Minister for Resettlement, Reconstruction and Hindu Religious Affairs, said yesterday.
In an interview with The Hindu, Mr. Swamianthan said that of about one lakh refugees in Tamil Nadu, most of them had got jobs there, married had children. ?Not all of them will come here. It is all rubbish.?
Mr. Swaminathan, who received 65 refugees on their arrival at the Bandaranaike International Airport on Wednesday, said earlier, those returning to Sri Lanka had to face interrogation that would go on for four to five hours.
?The refugees were scared of interrogation? and this was ?the basic problem? that came in their way to return home. ?We are trying to reduce its duration of to the extent possible,? he said.
Till now, the refugees, on their return, had to undergo interrogation by three agencies. Now, officials of the agencies were carrying it out together.
Mr. Swaminathan said his Ministry had been working closely with the Army, Emigration and the Police authorities on this issue. Calling his department?s task ?PR job,? he said only through closer coordination with other departments, work could be done.
Emphasising that his government would welcome all those refugees who were willing to return, Mr. Swaminathan said that of those who returned on Thursday, there were people who had Indian passports. ?They can come back to Sri Lanka under the dual citizenship system. After all, it is their home country.?
He urged those refugees who were planning to return to tell his Ministry in advance so that facilities could be provided on their return. ?Those having own lands can go straightaway to their places,? he said.(The Hindu)

May 19 is Remembrance Day: Rajitha
	
The new government has decided to declare May 19 as Remembrance Day instead of Victory Day as it named by the previous regime, Government Spokesman and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne
He said May 19, which was for the past five years was celebrated as "Victory Day" by the Rajapaksa regime, would be observed as "Remembrance Day" to mark the sacrifices made by all those, who irrespective of their ethnicity, safeguarded the unity and territorial integrity of the country and it will also be a day to remember those who died during the 30-year armed conflict.
?The main ?Remembrance Day? ceremony event will be held at Samudra Mawatha in Matara and will be a special gesture to move further towards reconciliation among all communities in Sri Lanka. Since the end of the armed conflict which ended with the defeat of the LTTE on May 19, 2009, the previous regime celebrated this day as a day of triumph by the armed forces against terrorism,? the minister. ?There will be a military parade under the patronage of the President Maithripala Sirisena as Commander-In-Chief. It will be a War Heroes? Commemoration Day as well as a civilian Remembrance Day.?
He said the government had laid the ground work for true reconciliation and communal harmony by releasing the original lands of residence to their rightful owners and restoring civil administration and good governance in the North.
?This is why the so-called Tamil diaspora is silent now there being nothing to crow about. Neither do you hear about their activities against Sri Lanka. Northern Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran and TNA members welcome and attend any function attended by President Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe or any other minister when they visit the North. The TNA not like in the past, it cooperates with the government in parliament and participates in debates and vote with enthusiasm. They respect the national flag and the national anthem. Parliament has turned out to be a lovely place by these positive developments. The reconciliation and the peace initiative of the government have paid dividends,? the minister said. ?
He said despite all these confidence-building measures by the government, a few TNA members of the Northern Provincial Council have announced they would mark the week May 13 to 19 as the "genocidal week" to commemorate the Tamils including the LTTE cadres, who died during the armed conflict.
Public Administration, Local Government, Democratic Governance and Budahsasana Minister Karu Jayasuriya warned the people to desist from holding such events for the LTTE cadres.
"The Government will in no way permit anyone to commemorate the LTTE which was a terrorist group," he said and added that terrorism would not be allowed to raise its head again.
He said there were some mischievious elements who wanted to misuse the democratic freedom now prevailing in the country.
Meanwhile, North DIG G.K. Perera told Daily Mirror the police have been placed on high alert in the North to prevent any glorification of dead terrorists.
?We have information that there will be religious ceremonies in Hindu Kovils on Tuesday to remember the dead. We don?t want to disrupt religious activities but if they attempt to commemorate terrorists who died in the separatist war, we would have to take appropriate action to prevent it because commemorating the members of a prohibited terrorist organisation is against the law of the land,? the DIG said.(Sandun A Jayasekera)? ?
