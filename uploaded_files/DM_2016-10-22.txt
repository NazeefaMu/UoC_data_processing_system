Govt. to  develop H'tota Port on PPP basis
	
The Government has decided to enter into an agreement with China Merchants Holdings (International) Company Ltd to develop the Hambantota Port on basis of a Private-Public Partnership (PPP) with 80 per cent of the shares transferred to the company.
The port project is being developed at an estimated cost of US$1,394 million, with the government expected to convert US$1,080 million as equity under this agreement with the Chinese company.
It is a flagship company of the China Merchants Group and invested in the upgrading of the Colombo South Container Terminal.
It had also bid for the Mattala Airport for which the government had received two proposals.
These two projects were carried out by the previous government with financial assistance from China. A government source said a large percentage of the loans obtained for these projects would be converted to equity.
This will help us reduce the debt burden to a great extent. It is a main budgetary requirement, he said.
The government is also hoping to develop the SriLankan airlines on the lines of a PPP with several parties submitting 'Expressions of Interest'. (Kelum Bandara)

Hidden conspiracy behind Mihin Lanka winding up: Employees
	
While claiming an alleged hidden conspiracy behind the governments decision to wind up the budget airline Mihin Lanka, a group of employees of the airline yesterday stressed that their job security be ensured.
Speaking at a media briefing at Public Library, Colombo, yesterday Mihin Lanka purser and Secretary of the newly-formed Trade Union Ms. Primali Kumaranayake said the airline management had not officially informed them about the future of the airline and its staff.
The airline, which has announced the discontinuation of its flights and services from October 30, 2016 would still exist till March 31, 2017, the management had reportedly told the staff.
However, 90% of the 300 airline staff, including both the permanent and the contract cadres are losing their jobs with effect from January 1, 2017, while only 10% have already been offered jobs at the Sri Lankan Airlines, Ms. Kumaranayake said.
Around 270 Mihin Lanka staff members have been subjected to grave injustice despite their service, professional achievements and seniority for more than nine years. Even though the management had informed about the merging of our flights and services with Sri Lankan, they have not mentioned anything about our future. The compensation they later agreed to pay us is unfair and inadequate, she said.
Another Mihin Lanka purser and Convener of the trade union Ms. Shaheeka Shaheed said there is no valid and fair reason for the government to close the budget airline which was starting to gain profits on its own and has not even been declared bankrupt.
According to her, Sri Lankan Airlines had already taken over 4 aircraft and 12 destinations of Mihin. She said they were earlier told by the management that they would be recruited to the National Carrier and assured their jobs would not be in danger during the transition. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Public needs awareness on Right to Information Act: Mahanayaka Theras
	
The Mahanayaka Theras of Malwatta and Asgiri Chapters said the Right to Information Act introduced by the government is beneficial to both the media persons and the general public of the country alike.
The prelates expressed their views when the Minister of Mass Media and Information Gayantha Karunathilaka and the Director General of Government Information Dr. Ranga Kalansooriya met them at their temples in Kandy on Friday (21).
The Mahanayaka of Malwatta Chapter Most Ven. Thibbotuwawe Sri Sumangala Thera said people seem to be still not knowledgeable of the Act.
The minister told the Mahanayaka Theras that awareness raising workshops are being held throughout country for the general public and media person on the importance and usefulness of the Act.
People of the country could enjoy the right to information without any difficulty under the present government what they could not get during the last government. The minister also said in India this right was gained by the people after staging struggles in streets.
Under this Act, people could get any necessary information from the government institutions and officials are bound to give relevant information, the minister explained to the prelates.
Director General of Government Information Dr. Ranga Kalansooriya said now any citizen has the access to the information they want from the government institutions except for those related to national security.

SL man enslaved and sexually abused in Scotland
	
A Sir Lankan man has spoken of the horror of being enslaved and sexually abused in Dundee, Scotland.
In a chilling insight into modern slavery in the city, Asha revealed how he was treated like an animal and forced to work in a bed and breakfast for just 33p an hour  while being routinely groped by his tormentor.
Speaking at a press conference held by Migrant Help UK, Asha said the B&B owner had him at his mercy by threatening to expose his sexuality, which is illegal in his home country.
He was forced to work 15 hours a day without time off for 150 a month, he said.
Reliving the sexual abuse, Asha said: When I was in the kitchen he would be touching me and when he gave me a hug it would be a disgusting feeling because he was rubbing himself on me.
He was treating me like an animal. I asked him to stop treating me like this and he wouldnt.
Asha  not his real name  arrived in the country in 2011 on a domestic worker visa, having fled his homeland because of the street beatings he suffered for being gay.
Asha was given permanent leave to remain in the UK based on the risk of being persecuted in Sri Lanka. Asked how he felt just weeks after winning the right to stay, the 30-year-old said: I got my life. That is what Ive been waiting on for 30 years.
There are up to 13,000 people held in modern slavery in the UK, according to Home Office figures, with dozens of those likely to be living in Tayside and Fife.
Roger McVicker, from Migrant Help UK, which has supported Asha and many others like him, said the violence that characterised the transatlantic slave trade 200 years ago is still present in the modern form.
But he added: There is now also more subtle ways of coercing people  with blackmail and stigma  and threats of if you do not do what we tell you, we have videoed, we have photographed you, and we are going to show it to your family.
Det Insp Chris Lewis, from Police Scotlands human trafficking unit, said they have seen an increase in the crime over three years as sophisticated Scottish crime groups seek to tap into a $32bn a year industry. (The Courier)
