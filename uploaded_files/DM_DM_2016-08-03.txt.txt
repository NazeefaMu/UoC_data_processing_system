Avant Garde Captain re-remanded till Aug. 8
	
Avant Garde Captain Gennady Garvlov, remanded on charges of possessing and transporting illegal weapons was yesterday re-remanded till August 8 by Galle Chief Magistrate Nilupuli Lankapura.
CID informed Court that the Navy took in to custody the Avant Garde when it was within 11.95 nautical miles and therefore it came under the jurisdiction of the Court. According to the statement by the Training Inspector of the Merchant Shipping Secretariat the responsibility for possession of the cargo in transit rests with the captain of the ship.
CID also requested court to direct the relevant authorities to permit to take the photographs of the contents of the weapon boxes and containers within 14 days from August 2 and to take a sample of the suspects handwriting and fingerprints. The CID objected to the release of suspect on bail as investigations were still in progress.
The attorney appearing for the suspect said the statement by the Merchant Shipping Secretariat was not relevant because Avant Garde is not engaged in the import or export of cargo.
The lawyer appearing for the ship's owning company said documents A to G supported with affidavits have been submitted to seek the release of the ship.
The Judge after considering the submission of both the parties permitted the CID to take relevant photographs and obtain the samples of handwriting and fingerprints of the suspect.
Attorney Sampath Mendis appeared for the captain. Attorneys Ajith Pathirana, Prasanna Arampath appeared for the Avant Garde Maritime Shipping Company while Attorneys A.P.G. Sarathchandra, Chathura Dissanayake, Sujani Basnayaka appeared for Ceylon Shipping Company with President's Counsel Shanaka Ranasinghe.

Bashing it in public and courting it in secret
	
This prominent JO group member hailing from the upcountry rode high and mighty in the media scene during the previous regime.
This worthy started his political career as a Green and later switched over to the Betel leaf which he felt was more politically congenial. When his political fortunes took a nose-dive after January 8, 2014, he made several overtures to the Green leadership which drew no positive response. Resigned to his lot with the JO group, he jumped on the yahapalanaya-bashing bandwagon.
This former purohita recently attended the funeral of the mother of a powerful purohita from the central hills. At this funeral he is said to have had a secret powwow with some top brass of yahapalanaya.
It is an open secret now that this onetime media boss currently facing a series of court cases is rearing to team up with the yahapalanaya as a means of getting out of his present predicament.

He said the government had seized high tech equipment with the capacity to tap any telephone conversation. The minister said it had been bought by the previous government at a cost of US$150,000 and that it was still in its original packing.
"We intend returning it to the company that sold it as we have nothing to do with such tapping machines. The members of the previous regime have imported such equipment to tap the telephone conversations of the then opposition UNP members, the minister said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Disgraceful deal between MR and RW: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) alleged today that the most disgraceful deal in the country was taking place between Ranil Wickremesinghe and Mahinda Rajapaksa.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that Shiranthi Rajapaksa, who had been summoned to the FCID to record a statement over a financial misappropriation, went to the Speakers official residence to give the statement as a result of the agreement between Mr. Rajapaksa and Mr. Wickremesinghe.
After investigations, Mrs. Rajapaksa should be arrested and produced in courts. Why is she not arrested even after four months Mahinda Rajapaksa has phoned Mr. Wickremesinghe and prevented the arrest. These are the deals. The President, and the Prime Minister were also asked to mediate in Wimal Weerawansas passport case, he said.
He said Mr. Wickremesinghes tactics had been to divide the SLFP just as former President J.R. Jayewardene acted to divide the SLFP, to resist the Opposition.
Mr. Jayewardene used Anura Bandaranaike to create rifts in the SLFP. Today Mr. Wickremesinghes tactic is also to divide the SLFP.
The Rajapaksa faction is working towards that direction on the instruction of Mr. Wickremesinghe. Basil Rajapaksa was hospitalised soon after his arrest following the agreement. After the Pada Yathra, no leader criticised Mr. Wickremesinghe, because this group is acting on the behest of Mr. Wickremesinghe, he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said the main crisis in the country was the decrease of the State revenue just as in the case of the previous Government and added that the only solution to this Government had been the tax revenue.
Today the tax revenue is 90% of the State revenue. There have been complications of the tax policy and it had been even more complicated due to the new VAT revision. We cannot find solutions to the economic crisis just by defeating the tax Act. It can be done only by defeating the economic policy of the Government, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Emirates plane on fire after crash-landing
	
An Emirates passenger jet has crash landed at Dubai Airport this morning before exploding into a massive fireball on the runway.
Thick black smoke could be seen rising over Dubai International Airport after an Emirates Boeing 777, carrying 282 passengers and 18 crew was forced into an emergency landing at around 12.45pm local time.
There are reports the landing gear for the plane, which had flown from Trivandrum International Airport in India, may not have come down fully prior to touching down. Other reports claimed the engine on the right side caught fire and fell off while landing.
Dramatic footage shows the aircraft exploding in a fireball on the runway, with the force of the blast throwing a huge metal panel from the plane into the air. Separate video captures the moment it scrapes along the runway before coming to a halt in a cloud of smoke.
Incredibly, all passengers were reportedly evacuated safely within 45 seconds of landing before the plane was engulfed in flames.
Photographs of the incident showed a plane lying crumpled on its belly on the tarmac with black smoke pouring from its upper section.
The captain is believed to have sent out and emergency signal in the moments before the plane was preparing to land.
A pilot who witnessed flight EK521 landing told NDTV the plane came in 'really hard' and hit the 'runway tail'. A passenger on another plane said she could see emergency chutes deployed.
All flights to the Dubai terminal have been diverted while emergency crews work at the scene. All take-offs and landings have been suspended.
Chris Galusha landed at Dubai Airport just 25 minutes before the plane crash landed, which has caused four to five hours of delays.
The board is slowly updating major delays. Cannot see anything from terminal at this time, he tweeted MailOnline, alongside a picture of the departure screen showing all flights as delayed.
Airport is quiet right now. Calm before storm before people deplane, he tweeted. 
In one video posted online a woman with a British accent can be heard gasping as she watched from the terminal.
Are there people in that plane Oh my god, the smokes getting darker, she says.
Emirates said in a statement: 'Emirates can confirm that today, August 3 2016, flight EK521 travelling from Trivandrum International Airport in Thiruvananthapuram, India to Dubai has been involved in an accident at Dubai International Airport. There were 282 passengers and 18 crew on board.
'The Boeing 777 aircraft, departed at 10.19am from Trivandrum International Airport and was scheduled to land at 12.50pm at Dubai International Airport.
'We can confirm that there are no fatalities among our passengers and crew. All passengers and crew are accounted for and safe.
'We are expecting a four-hour network wide delay, more information will be available on the Emirates website and social media channels.'
The Dubai government's official media office said: 'All passengers were evacuated safely and no injuries have been reported so far.
'Concerned Authorities at Dubai International Airport are dealing with the incident at the moment to ensure safety of all.'
Planemaker Boeing said in a statement it was monitoring the situation in Dubai and it would be working with Emirates to gather more information.
Meanwhile, the pilot and crew have been roundly praised for landing the plane, with initial reports suggesting the pilot asked the airport for permission for a crash landing.
Emirates pilot looks like he expertly landed the 777, and although there was a fire, still was time for pax [sic] to exit, get away, Tweeted US-based journalist and aviation blogger Gerry Doyle.
And an Indian journalist for ABP news wrote: 'Passengers on board Emirates flight almost kiss & survive death..Pilot deserves all praises to have managed to save so many lives.'
Also praising the pilot from India, where the flight originated, was Bollywood star Pushkar Jog, who said: Emirates EK521 flight crashes after landing at d Dubai airport . Pilot saved 282 lives ..All passengers safe.
Dubai International is by far the Middle East's busiest airport, and is the world's busiest air hub in terms of international passenger traffic.
Government-backed Emirates is the region's biggest carrier, and operates the world's largest airline fleet of the wide-body 777 long-haul aircraft.
The incident comes almost four months after a plane belonging to Dubai's other carrier, flydubai, crashed and burst into flames as it was landing in Rostov-on-Don, in southern Russia, killing all 61 people onboard.
On July 26, an Emirates Boeing 777-300 aircraft heading to the Maldives made an emergency landing in Mumbai because of a 'technical fault'.
Dubai International is the world's largest hub in terms of international passengers, and is the base for Emirates, from where it serves more than 153 destinations.
Emirates, Qatar Airways and Abu Dhabi's Etihad have seized a significant portion of transcontinental travel, capitalising on the geographic locations of their Gulf hubs.
Emirates is the largest single operator of the Boeing 777, as well as the Airbus A380 superjumbo, and has expanded its fleet to 250 aircraft last year.
Thiruvananthapuram is the capital of the southwestern Indian state of Kerala, a popular beachside tourist destination. Many blue-collar migrant workers employed in the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf nations come from Kerala. (Daily Mail)

Framework for democracy, reconciliation and development in place: Mangala
	
Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the National Unity Government was now putting in place the framework for democracy, reconciliation and development.
Addressing the Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2016, he said this framework would break-through Sri Lankas post-Independence malaise of consistently missing opportunities and simply doing too little too late.
We have made great strides in the areas of democratisation and foreign affairs. We are making progress on reconciliation. The framework for the reconciliation process will be in place once the mechanisms outlined in the Geneva Resolution, which brought us a tsunami of international good will, and the new constitution are implemented. The new constitution will entrench the changes we made under the 100 Day Work Programme and will help ensure that Sri Lanka is truly united and at peace for generations through a constitution that enshrines our multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, multi-lingual and multi-religious character, he said
He said the next major challenge for Sri Lanka was development, particularly generating growth and employment.
We need to provide a peace dividend to our people; they need to feel that year-by-year their pockets are fuller and their standards of living are better, he added.
Mr. Samaraweera said if Sri Lanka was to truly achieve the breakthrough that Singapore, Korea and the other East Asian Tigers experienced, we need to reform our public enterprises.
There are three main reasons for this: reforming public enterprise is critical for, one, improving Sri Lankan living standards, two, improving our competitiveness and, three, reducing corruption in politics and government, he said.
Public enterprises in Sri Lanka are largely loss-making because they are corrupt and inefficient. They suffer from chronic conflicts-of-interest, politicisation and are captured by vested interests. Take the case of Sri Lankan Airlines: although the government at the time made it out that the re-nationalisation was an act of nationalistic fervour and portrayed it as a patriotic gesture, the true motivation for the nationalisation was to abuse and use the airline for their whims and fancies, he said.

GAAM-AFC introduce Sri Lankas first dual return investment plan
	
Alpha Plus, Sri Lankas first dual return investment plan, is now available to investors as a result of a partnership between Alliance Finance PLC (AFC) and Guardian Acuity Asset Management (GAAM), a leading unit trust management company which is part of Carson Cumberbatch PLC, HNB and DFCC banks.
Alpha Plus is a dual return investment plan, where plan funds are invested in both fixed deposits and in equity, thereby giving investors exposure to returns of two asset classes, with a single investment. The recommended mix of investment being 70 percent in fixed deposits and 30 percent in equity, explained GAAM Fund Manager Asanka Jayasekara.
A dual return enables the investor to benefit from both fixed deposits as well as equity funds as the investment plan invests in both fixed deposits and equity, hence the return to investors will stem from these two sources, making it a dual return investment plan.
When an investor invests money in the Alpha Plus plan, a fixed deposit (FD) will be opened with Alliance Finance with a portion of the money and the balance will be allocated towards the Guardian Acuity Equity Fund, which will be managed by a specialized fund manager.
The recommended investment plan is to invest a minimum of Rs.2.5 million for a period of three years, with an investment mix of fixed income of 70 percent and equity 30 percent. However, although this is the recommended mix, the plan is flexible to suit an individuals risk/return profile. Alpha Plus was initiated with the objective to create an opportunity for customers to yield a better return for their investments in the capital market in line with Alliance Finances triple bottom line concept, said Alliance Finance Company PLC Chief Operations Officer Emmanuel Muttupulle.
The benefits of investing in Alpha Plus include a potential higher return, stemming from attractive FD rates (based on the rates offered for AFC deposits) and equity returns (based on the performance of GAAM equity unit trust portfolio), while the investment will be in the hands of skilled professionals who have a long-term proven track record to their credit. Investors will also have the opportunity to diversify their investment portfolio, while having a hassle-free investment experience with regular updates on returns, as well as a tax-efficient investment given that unit trust returns are tax free in the hands of unit holders. The FD can be used as a source of income with interest withdrawals or the interest can be retained along with the equity investment to add to capital appreciation.
Alpha Plus is open to both corporates and individuals who seek a long-term exposure to the equity markets while at the same time enjoy a guaranteed long-term fixed deposit return, said Guardian Acuity Manager Business Development Roshan Fernando, who is responsible for servicing the Alliance Finance clientele.
While we recommend that investors stay invested for the entire period to earn the maximum benefit from equity investments, investors always have the options for early withdrawals from both the FD and the equity investment in case they have an unforeseen cash requirement. A 2 percent early withdrawal fee will be charged if investors pull out their money from the equity fund before the end of the first year of the investment but otherwise we have no front end or exit fees, he further said.
Although early redemption is not recommended since the equity returns can be volatile. Furthermore, the returns from the equity fund are tax free in the hands of the investor, he noted.
The investment processes is made easy with the product available in select branches of Alliance Finance and investors can also contact their relevant relationship manager.

Religious dignitaries from all denominations, purohitas of all ranks, Ministry secretaries, departmental heads and top brass of the security forces were among the distinguished guests who attended the opening of the Moragahakanda Multi-Purpose Development Project commissioned under the patronage of the top duo of yahapalanaya the other day.
The white-collar high-ups who had organized the big event had arranged the seating on the stage strictly in order of precedence. Meanwhile, a departmental head in the Defense sector, finding that the seat reserved for him in a row of seats meant for Ministry secretaries and security top brass flew into a rage and ordered the security personnel on duty to place his chair in the front row.
By the time this departmental head took his seat in the front row, a number of senior purohitas of Cabinet rank were already occupying the seats reserved for them in the second and third rows and some of them had taken immediate exception to the departmental heads high handed act. This matter was due to have an echo at the regular weekly meeting of the top team of yahapalanaya, they say.

Hooting: Foolish act, if happened, says MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today said it was a foolish act if the Joint Opposition supporters hooted in front of the Sri Lanka Freedom Partys (SLFP) headquarters during the Paada Yathra.
Speaking to media, Mr. Rajapaksa said there was no such incident in his presence and he would never let such things to take place.
He also said it was foolish to engage in such an act, as it was their party headquarters.
Some other political party could have been involved in this incident as some people are used to engage in such things. There were some government representatives among the supporters at the Paada Yathra. The hooting is a fact to be reviewed. In my opinion, it was done under somebody elses instigation, he added.
He said it was depressing if someone among the Joint Opposition supporters were involved in this incident. He said the others should reason out this situation, as to why such an incident had happened.
The headquarters was a respectable place. There is a long history. This place had been sealed and tear-gassed by the United National Party. The ones who are now talking about the hooting have done such things also, he added.
He said the Government should listen to the peoples voice instead of looking at them in a prejudiced manner. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

The hooting by the Joint Opposition supporters in front of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) headquarters during the Paada Yathra was an insult to their own party, Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa said today.
Addressing a media briefing, the Minister said it was an unfortunate incident not only for the party members but also for the all the SLFP supporters in the country. He said the former Presidents response to this incident was not an excuse.
The former President said that this hooting has been done by a group, who is not connected to them. It is not a justifiable clarification. There were many responsible Parliamentarians and including the former President at the time of the incident. Several young Parliamentarians including Namal Rajapaksa were also presented, he added.
The Minister questioned how would the Opposition govern a country, if it could not manage protest walk from Kandy to Colombo in a well behaved manner.
Meanwhile, he said President Maithripala Sirisenas silence and tolerant response for such ill-mannered incidents was not his weakness.
He is silent in order to protect the unity in the party. His motive is to keep the party without any rifts, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Members of former govt. are telling fairy tales: MS
	
The members of the former government are now walking the streets and telling fairy tales. But the people are suffering due to the economic debacle caused by them, President Maithripala Sirisena charged yesterday.
Speaking at the inauguration of the Sri Lanka Economic Forum, held yesterday at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel in Colombo, President Sirisena said that Sri Lanka was now suffering from a debt trap of Rs. 9000 billion inherited from the Rajapaksa regime
Politicians, government officers and all the people in the country should understand that the economic debacle was caused by the former government, he said.
The contribution of the small and medium industries to the economy of the country is currently between 8% and 10%. If we can increase it to 20%, the national economy can be strengthened," he said.
Despite the burden of debts that this government inherited from the previous government we will not cut the subsidies. At the same time, there must be a definite increase in production to find the money for the subsidies, he said.
He pointed out the importance of maintaining better state financial management and financial discipline in a way that would not burden the people. He said that the public and private sectors should commence a new journey together to do so.
He said people cannot be happy with the contributions to the economy made by the small and medium industries and there was a question of whether we were truly reaping the benefits of the ocean around us and other rich resources.
During this conference, attention had been drawn to taking action rather than merely talking -- with the aim of achieving the dream of becoming one of the best countries in the Asian region by utilizing our own resources.
This economic summit that was organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce for the 17th consecutive year was on the theme, Focus, Act, Deliver. It will continue today.

Paada Yathra was a success: JO
	
The Joint Opposition (JO) said yesterday that its Jana Satana Paada Yathrawa was a major success despite statements to the contrary by the government -- and that the march proved that it, and not the Opposition in parliament, was the real Opposition.
Speaking at a media briefing, Wimal Weerawansa MP alleged that the JO was the opposition of the people and that the Opposition in parliament was appointed by the Government.
This is why the Opposition Leader and Chief Organiser of the Opposition (who were both appointed by the government) continue to criticise the Paada Yathra. We challenge them to bring together at least one eighth of the people who gathered at the Paada Yathra at one place, he said.
He also accused the police chief of being politically biased.
Meanwhile, the Paada Yathra Organising Committee chairman, Mahindananda Aluthgamage said the governments arbitrary decisions were being endorsed by parliament because it had created an artificial two-thirds majority in parliament.
He said the Paada Yathra proved that it was the JO that had the backing of a majority of the people and that at least 2 million people had joined in the march.
Our intention was not to send the government home but to send a warning to it to stay on the right path. It should address the issues of the postponement of local government elections, tax increases, the ETCA, the curtailment of farmers relief, the Constitutional trap and political witch-hunts, he said.
He said that if the government signed the ETCA, the JO would take to the streets again, and the government would then have many problems. The next time, we wont just issue warnings, we will get together to chase the government away, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Pushing it under the carpet
	
A powerful purohita from Rajarata has made a financial crime allegation against another colleague  a big-mouthed one hailing from the same province.
According to the allegation, the big-mouthed one had caused a financial loss of about Rs.400 million by selling off a large stock of paddy at a price much lower than the buying price trotting out the excuse that he had to empty the clogged paddy boards warehouses to take in new stocks from
the farmers.
Some charge that the paddy stocks were sold out for the manufacture of ethanol following a secret understanding reached with the businessmen involved. The purohita concerned vehemently denies this charge. Meanwhile, some sources say that no investigation into this charge is likely to carried out as the two purohitas are from the two main constituents of the yahapalanaya government.

Revelation on Port City reflects badly on India, China: JO
	
The Governments revelation that it had to suspend the Port City Project due to pressure from India not only shows the incompetency of the government but also reflects badly on both India and China, the joint opposition charged today.
Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Rajitha Senaratne on Tuesday revealed that the Port City Project, which was initiated by the Rajapaksa government and launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping, had to be suspended and re-visited because of pressure from India.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena told a news conference that it was surprising to note that the government had taken one and half years to reveal the real reason behind the suspension of the Chinese-funded project.
But then again, the statements of the Cabinet spokesman hold little value. But if what he says is true, this is a serious matter, he said.
Meanwhile, MP Bandula Gunawardane said the decision to suspend the project under Indian pressure shows the incompetency and the naive nature of the government. After all, the project was launched by the Chinese President. How can they suspend it just because India told them to do so, he asked.
When asked about the shortcomings of the first agreement signedby the previous government and alleged harmful clauses in it, the MP said the agreement was not presented in Parliament and therefore the MPs didnt see the contents.
Minister Senaratne said a 20-hectare block of land set aside for the port city was to be granted to the CHEC Port City (Pvt) Ltd on a freehold basis according to the first agreement and that there was the risk of project management refusing landing rights to Sri Lankas aircraft on the properties under its purview and prohibit the use of its air space.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

Sanasa Development Bank  We are family, says CEO
	
Sanasa Development Bank General Manager/CEO Nimal C. Hapuarachchi

Sanasa Development Bank, which has been operating a very successful microfinance system in rural Sri Lanka, is now gearing to move to the next level. The bank has already begun to support the small and medium size enterprise sector, which it intends to expand on, and Sanasa Development CEO Nimal Hapuarachchi said, This is the obvious direction this institution has to move towards, as we believe that our development is directly connected to the growth of our customers.
The bank, which has already established a unique homegrown model in supporting income generation and wealth creation in the rural sector, has its roots in the co-operative sector. 
Sanasa Development Bank Chairperson Samadani Kiriwandeniya said, This institution strongly believes in the concept that we must grow as a community and the destination of our journey is sustainable development. Our most important shareholders are the men and women who sustain the smallest units of our society.
Elaborating on that, Nimal Hapuarachchi says, That smallest unit is the family, which has always been our primary focus. We are a family bank  the Sanasa family bank.
The Sanasa family consists of close to four to five million people. The Sanansa co-operative movement has one million members and going on the assumption that most of these members have families comprising of about four to five people, the Sanasa umbrella touches the lives of approximately 20 percent of the Sri Lankan population.
While microfinancing was the backbone in terms of uplifting the countrys rural economy where the bank has been lending to the bottom of the pyramid with small loans between hundred to two hundred thousand, we believe that there is a segment in the lower rungs of our society who want to move to the next level. This means requiring larger loans to create big opportunities. Whilst in the past we encouraged people to look for such loans outside our network, we have now taken a strategic decision to keep supporting this segment so that we remain close to these entrepreneurs and as has been the practice of the bank, create synergies to grow together, said Hapuarachchi.
The bank, whilst offering loans to its customers, keeps close tabs on their activities and supports them with training, capacity building and advisory services to enhance and grow their businesses. This in turn has kept the banks non-performing loans below 1 percent nett, which is a benchmark in local banking standards.
We are not into predatory lending and we carefully analyse our customer needs and the viability of the venture prior to lending so that borrowers and indirectly their families as well are protected from penury from a bad business decision. This very sustainable approach the bank has taken in the last 19 years has helped create a strong link of mutual trust between the institution and our customers. The Sanasa motto is to go beyond the lender, borrower relationship, that is the way in which the bank supports its family, the CEO says.
The aim and structure of Sanasa Development Bank is attributed to one man, Dr. P.A. Kiriwandeniya, its founder Chairman whose vision, commitment and strong leadership have become legendary within the industry. He foresaw the potential co-operative philosophy has in empowering the marginalised by working together to resolve their problems of need and want.
The visionary founder retired in 2011, handing over the reins to a professional team who is expected to take the bank to the future. The current board consists of four shareholder directors who are elected at the AGM by majority vote and four independent directors who are people of standing in society and industry circles i.e. veteran bankers, financiers and experts in the academic field. All appointments are subject to the Central Bank approval.
This institution is a public quoted company and has shareholders from grassroot level. Out of its forty thousand shareholders, thirty eight thousand have bundles less than a thousand shares. Whilst the Sanasa banking model is rural centric, it also acts as a bridge to connect the rural economy to the city. Whilst traditionally, rural financing has been controlled by money lenders and loan sharks, the Sanasa banking system, which is under a special banking licence from the Central bank and monitored stringently by this institution, has brought in a sustainable source of financing for the upliftment of the marginalised people of our society, said the CEO.
I am also pleased to say that despite the various challenges faced by the bank during the year under review, we were able to record a groundbreaking performance as the banks net profit before tax surpassed the Rs.1 billion mark for the first time in our history, he added.

SLFP to decide on disciplinary action at CC meeting
	
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Central Committee will take disciplinary action against members of the party who participated at the paada yathra organized by the joint opposition.
SLFP General Secretary and Minister Duminda Dissanayake said that action would also be taken against those who hooted at the headquarters.
We will take action against the people who participated in this march at our next Central Committee (CC) meeting. The behavior of those who participated was deplorable he said.
The minister said the march was in no way a threat to the government which would continue to be in power for the next four years.
This was a march organized to take revenge on SLFP party members and that is how we see it. Mahinda Rajapaksa doesnt have a party and he wants to break the existing party, that is what this was all about and not about overthrowing the government, he said.
The minister said the distinction between the former President and the current President was that the latter was focused on uniting the party while the former has repeatedly attempted to divide it. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Speaker not yet signed RTI: Dinesh
	
Joint Opposition leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena today rejected Minister Gayantha Karunathilakas statement that the Speaker had placed his signature on the Right to Information (RTI) Bill allowing it to become the law.
Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka at the Cabinet news briefing on Tuesday said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had signed the RTI Bill.
However, MP Gunawardena said today he called up relevant authorities on Wednesday morning twice and received confirmation that the Speaker had not placed his signature on the Bill.
This is a false statement. The Speaker didnt sign the Bill yet. We, the Joint Opposition submitted two amendments to the Bill and the Government too accepted that the proposed amendments should be included in the Bill. The Attorney Generals Department, Legal Draftsmans Department and the Parliament Secretary General are still going through the amendments, he said.
He said the amendments were submitted over a month ago, but no outcome had been generated so far.
The Bill was passed in Parliament on June 24 unanimously.
Parliament Secretary General earlier said they had faced difficulties in the wording of the amendments into legal format, resulting in the delays. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Tamil for pre-interns hits snag as Ministries squabble
	
Tamil language training programme for pre-intern medical officers was halted this year as a result of a tug-of-war between the Health Ministry and Ministry of National Languages and Social Integration, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said yesterday.
According to the GMOA, the Health Ministry officials had not settled the payments to the National Institute of Language Education and Training (NILET) for the Tamil language fluency training programmes held in 2014 and 2015.
The NILET which functions under the Ministry of National Languages and Social Integration organises the Tamil training programme for doctors every year.
However, the officials of the Health Ministry had told the GMOA, that they could not settle the payments because the NILET had not submitted required documents relating to the language training programmes held in 2014 and 2015. (Piyumi Fonseka)

They got only a clue to make a guess
	
Several senior purohitas of yahapalanaya were having a good time together. They were all a bit soaked, but had their heads up. And then  the question arose as to how they could hook a few guys from the JO camp.
A senior one from the West said that there were at least three from the camp ready to come running if they were assured of places in the top team.
Who are they, Machang a stalwart from the Kalutara district asked.
I cant give the names. But I can assure that this information is 100 percent correct! said the Kalutara one.
Pressed to give at least a clue to make a reasonable guess, the Kalutara purohita said: One of them is a big mouth from Galle  Matara area. Another one is residing in a locality from where they could hear the drum beat of the Tevava ceremony at Sri Dalada Maligawa. The third one is living close to the Dambulla rock. Now go ahead and make
your guess!
