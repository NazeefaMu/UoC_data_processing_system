Not so underdog
	
This is the moment a cheetah was so taken aback by its prey turning the tables, that it simply put its tail between its legs and ran off - chased by what had been its lunchtime snack just moments before.
The cheetah was pursuing an animal which appears to be a wild dog or bat-eared fox in Kenya's Maasai Mara National Reserve, but rather than finishing it off, the big cat found itself being chased off by its prey half its size.
The photographs were taken by Jorge Alescano, 42, from Spain, who said: 'It was as if the dog just decided he didn't want to be dinner any more - it was amazing. We've got no idea why the cheetah reacted like this.
'It's a mystery to me because the dog would have been an easy meal for the cheetah if he had carried on with the pursuit.
'He dramatically stopped the chase and caused the cheetah to lose balance but what happened next was even more surprising.
'He then began to chase the cheetah away which was incredible to watch - it was a once in a life time opportunity.' Picture courtesy dailymail

Electricity: smart meters from tomorrow
	
The Power Ministry would commission the Smart Meter System (SMS) for measuring electricity usage from tomorrow, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said yesterday.
The smart meters would charge a lower tariff from customers, when consumers use power during non-peak hours, he said.
Currently the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) charges an across the board tariff based on the amount of power a household or establishment uses per month.
A smart meter is usually an electronic device, that records consumption of electric energy in intervals of an hour or less and communicates that information at least daily back to the utility provider for monitoring and billing.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said the government, in a bid to boost local industries and accelerate exports, had decided to put in place a new tariff scheme for small and medium industries.
Under the new system, small and medium scale industries will have to pay only 25 percent of the cost of power and the remaining 75 percent will have to paid in equal installments in five years.
Smart meters enable two-way communication between the meter and the central system.
Unlike home energy monitors, smart meters can gather data for remote reporting. Such an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) differs from traditional automatic meter reading (AMR) in that it enables two-way communications with the meter benefiting both the utility provider and the customer.
The Minister said tomorrows launching of the SMS marked the completion of one year in Presidency and the electoral victory of President Maithripala Sirisena.
We launch the use of smart meters from the business community first and gradually introduce it to normal households.
After the introduction of SMS, the monthly electricity charges will be calculated on the data recorded in the smart meter and the monthly tariff bill of consumers will be prepared based on the data, Minister Siyambalapitiya said.
The 100 percent electrification of the country is scheduled to be completed before the end of this year and the first district that will achieve full electrification will be the Polonnaruwa District.
The CEB will provide power to 250,000 houses and State and private establishments in the Polonnaruwa District this year.
The Power and Renewable Energy Ministry will also launch a national awareness programme to educate the public on the safety and frugal use of power and the importance of using household appliances, which will help reduce electricity bill, Minister Siyambalapitiya added.

Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala said today the Foreign Employment Bureau would no longer make any effort to bring back Sri Lankan housemaids from abroad if they had not registered with the Bureau.
With this regulation coming into effect from January 1, this year, any housemaid, who had gone abroad for employment without registering with the Bureau, would not be brought back at state expense even in case of ill health, mistreatment by employers or their bodies in case of death.
The minister told a news conference that the Bureau had to spend about Rs.50 million including insurance payments last year to bring back injured Sri Lankan housemaids or the bodies in case of death even though they were employed through illegal and unregistered recruitment agencies.
In such cases family members will have to make a payment to the Bureau. The purpose of this regulation is to minimize Lankan workers going aboard in an illegal manner, she said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Norway seeks to renew political contact with SL
	
	Norway's foreign minister will visit Sri Lanka this week in a bid to re-establish political contact, his office said Tuesday, almost 10 years after Oslo failed in a bid to mediate in the island's civil war.
	Borge Brende's visit, which begins Thursday, will be the first by a Norwegian minister to Sri Lanka since 2006, the foreign ministry said in a statement.
	"The aim of the visit to Colombo is to re-establish political contact with Sri Lanka," Brende said, adding: "The recent political developments in the country in the past year have made this possible."
	In the early 2000s, Norway mediated between the Sri Lankan government and the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), but a 2002 ceasefire didn't last.
	Authoritarian president Mahinda Rajapakse, who was in power from 2005 to 2015, had questioned Norway's neutrality and quashed the guerrilla in 2009 during a major military offensive that brought an end to 37 years of fighting.
	Rajapakse last year failed to win a third term and handed over power to Maithripala Sirisena, who has vowed to work toward reconciliation and investigate crimes committed by the army during the military campaign run by his predecessor.
	During his visit, Brende is scheduled to meet with Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera and the new opposition leader, Tamil lawmaker Rajavarothiam Sampanthan. (Source: dailymail)

A rundown of the causes of death and crimes statistics provided by the Police Department today showed that while the number of reported rape, suicides and murders in the country had decreased slightly, the number of accidents had increased marginally when compared to 2014.

Security forces fully alert to ISIS threats: Ministry
	
The Defence Ministry today assured that security forces and all intelligence agencies were on full alert on the possibility of any groups having links with the ISIS making their appearance in Sri Lanka.

A statement issued by the ministry said some media reports had mentioned the presence of ISIS terrorists in the country or that groups having links to the ISIS were emerging in Sri Lanka.
Security forces wish to give categorical assurance that they are on full alert to the possibilities of any links or emergence of IS groups in Sri Lanka round the clock as it is the prime responsibility of the Security Forces and National Intelligence, it said.
The ministry said it was also noteworthy to remind that revelations in media reports, some with vital and sensitive information, often tend to become counterproductive and could jeopardize the efforts to identify such elements.
However, the situation is in no way a cause for alarm or panic, and any information to that effect as of now cannot be divulged to the Media since such intelligence is yet to be analyzed, evaluated and properly established, the ministry said.
