AG to decide on maintainability of Range Bandara's case
	
The Attorney General is being considered over the defence objection on the maintainability of the case where Minister Palitha Range Bandara was accused of obtaining Rs.5.4 million dishonestly inducing a person to deliver a vehicle registration permit, Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) Dilan Ratnayake told court today.
Earlier, the defence moved an objection over the maintainability of the case. However, the Attorney General is yet to make his stance on the objection, the DSG said.
Filing the indictment in the Colombo High Court, the Attorney General maintained that the State Minister had committed this offence on or around March 22, 2002 in Madiwela, after dishonestly inducing a person called Dinesh Ratnayake to deliver a vehicle registration permit for a luxury jeep (WP GK 4271).

Bond Scandal: CBSL not provided info it had to COPE
	
Testifying before the Bond Commission, Deputy Minister Dr Harsha de Silva today said despite several requests made during the course of COPE deliberations to obtain information regarding the secondary market transactions relating to all bond issuance since 2015 January, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka failed to provide them.
When questioned by State Counsel Dr Awanthi Perera, Dr Harsha de Silva, who was a member of the COPE, ascertained that the COPE kept asking the CBSL details about information regarding secondary market transactions to carry out broad investigations on the loss calculation due to the controversial bond issuances. However, he said the COPE was informed about the unavailability of such details at the time of the requests.
Correcting the witness assumption over unavailability of such information with the CBSL, the Commission confirmed that the requested secondary market transactions information was available with the CBSL at the time requests were made by COPE.
When cross examined, Dr de Silva held that all committee members of the COPE agreed collectively to the recommendations stated in the report and only nine members including him had inserted few foot notes, which were the concerns of clarifications regarding few suggestions of the report, but not disagreed to the context of COPE report.
When questioned by the Commission, it was explained that the COPE report was largely relied on Auditor Generals report despite there were some new documents called and shared with Auditor General by the Committee.
Dr Harsha de Silva was a member of the COPE committee of the 8th Parliament, which scrutinized the Controversial bond issuances, took place on February 2015 and March 2016.
Nihal Fernando PC who appeared for the Perpetual Treasuries Ltd and Counsel Shanaka de Silva who was appearing on behalf of former Governor Arjun Mahendran had cross examined the witness.
The Commission comprised with Supreme Court Judges Kankanithanthri T. Chitrasiri, Prasanna Sujeewa Jayawardena and former Deputy Auditor General Kandasamy Velupillai will resume the inquiry today. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

## Title: Butcher of Bosnia now faces war crime charges

Butcher of Bosnia now faces war crime charges
	
Ratko Mladic, when he commanded the Bosnian Serb army during the bitter 1992-95 Bosnian war, struck terror into the hearts of the minorities of the former Yugoslavia. Arrested finally in 2011 after 14 years in hiding, he now faces sentencing by the Hague war crimes tribunal, which has called for a life sentence for the man nicknamed The Butcher of Bosnia. 
The Mladic trial is one of the last cases to be heard by the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Set up in 1993, it has already given a 40-year sentence to the Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic, who was found guilty of genocide during the Srebrenica massacre. 
Mladic faces two charges of genocide, the second count for the same massacre in which over 7000 Muslim males were killed after being taken away from the supposedly UN-protected enclave in July 1995. He oversaw the siege of Sarajevo and daily deaths of its residents by shelling and sniper fire. 
Mladic knew ethnic violence as a child. His father was a partisan fighting the German army during WWII, and was killed in 1945 by the pro-Nazi Ustasha partisans. After training to be a tinsmith, Mladic joined the army and commanded units in Macedonia and Kosovo under the communist regime of President Josip Broz Tito. 
When the communist government collapsed in 1991 and the country disintegrated, Mladic was a Colonel and sent to fight Croat separatist forces. He won a reputation for reckless courage. When the war came to Bosnia in 1992, Mladic and his fellow Bosnian Serb officers changed their allegiance from Yugoslavia to the breakaway republic Srpska. But the ultimate mission was to conquer more territory for Serbs on behalf of President Milosevicin Belgrade. 


"Mladic faces two charges of genocide, the second count for the same massacre in which over 7000 Muslim males were killed in July 1995. He oversaw the siege of Sarajevo and daily deaths of its residents by shelling and sniper fire"

Now promoted as a General, Mladic cut off and began shelling his former neighbours in Sarajevo in May 1992, killing 10,000 people in three and a half years. 
After the war, the Yugoslav army consisted mainly of Serbians, and the general staff did its very best to protect Mladic, now the most wanted man in Europe with a prize of US$5 million on his head. An entire department called the 30th Personnel Centre, tasked to look after the social welfare of former Bosnian Serb officers, was now put in charge of Mladics welfare. A large force of about 100 bodyguards too, was set up. In addition, Mladic had his own driver and cook and personal waiter. 
Over the next few years, Mladic and his entourage lived comfortably in various Yugoslav army holiday retreats. He wasnt living like a fugitive. Travelling often to his home in Belgrade, where he relaxed with his children Darko and Ana. He dined out, went to football matches and played table tennis. 
He was a national hero to his loyal entourage. But, just to make sure nobody had any second thoughts, they were shown photos of their families  a classic blackmail tactic to tell them that it wasnt just their lives at stake should anyone change their minds. 
Though his future seemed to be secure at this stage, all wasnt well in Mladics private life. Daughter Ana, in her early 20s, was in love with a human rights activist who called Mladic a war criminal. He laid down a condition for marriage  he would marry Ana only if she renounced her father. Torn between conflicting interests, Ana killed herself in February 1994 with her fathers favourite pistol. 
Mladic was inconsolable, and claimed furiously that there was a conspiracy behind his daughters death, making his hatred of minorities even greater. In the meantime, Serbia was undergoing rapid transformation. Hardliner Milosevics popularity plunged, and he was defeated in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and even in the Serb heartland of Kosovo. He lost power in October 2000 and was delivered to the Hague in June 2001 to face war crimes charges. 


Mladic, no longer receiving State protection, began to feel vulnerable. He moved to a Tito-era refuge with underground bunkers in the countryside. The Belgrade government formally declared Mladics retirement from the army in March 2002, and a decree was issued in April legalizing cooperation with the ICTY. Serb generals were still on Mladics side, but they had no choice now but to tell him he could no longer take refuge in military spas. 
Initially, Mladic refused to leave until the army buzzed the base with helicopters. Mladic finally negotiated safe passage out of there, and left for a new hideout. His bodyguards were withdrawn and he was now protected by a handful of old comrades led by Jovo Djogo, a former Bosnian Serb Colonel. 
Mladic now lived in drab, rented apartments near Belgrade. His family could no longer visit him. Interestingly, he lived just a few apartments away from Radowan Caradzic, also hiding from genocide charges. The two men couldnt stand each other anyway, and their paths never crossed. 
Mladic banned the use of mobile phones and rarely went out except for an occasional walk with Darko. He wanted warm milk and honey before his morning exercises. His food had to be fresh, and he ordered the food to be bought from different shops. He looked after his appearance. 
The unexpected murder of Serbian Prime Ministe Zoran Djindjic in March 2003 by a group of paramilitary and criminal gangs, who feared his plans to smash organised crime and his cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, was a totally unexpected blow to Mladic because the security forces cracked down harshly and there were more than 13,000 arrests. Feeling more vulnerable than ever, Mladic changed apartments and told his bodyguards to stay a phone call away, only one minder at a time knowing his address. 


"Daughter Ana, in her early 20s, was in love with a human rights activist who called Mladic a war criminal. He laid down a condition for marriage  only if she renounced her father. Torn between conflicting interests, Ana killed herself in February 1994 with her fathers favourite pistol"

In October 2004, two soldiers were killed while on duty by a third party. The military tried to hush it up and the civilian commission investigating the deaths received threats. But they concluded that the two men had been killed because they got to know where Mladic was hiding. 
In December 2005, he was moved to a country cottage. But his protector Djogo was arrested, and Mladic panicked. He dropped Djogos team, and went alone to his brother-in-law Krsto Jegdics Belgrade apartment on Feb.4, 2006. In his backpack, Mladic carried a Heckler & Koch machine pistol and two pistols. 
Mladic told Jegdic bluntly that his sons life might be in danger if he were betrayed. But the threat backfired because Jegdics wife furiously told him he couldnt stay there. Finally, Jegdic drove Mladic to his brother Miroslavs home at a charming wooded settlement near the Sava River. 
This place with its scattered houses was safer than Belgrade, but men from the Security Information Agency (SIA) raided in one early morning. Mladic was lucky  the searchers looked in the wrong houses. According to a Western investigator, the raid was either clumsy or deliberately misleading, meant to fool Carla Del Ponte, the chief prosecutor of war crimes in former Yugoslavia. 
Two days later, Mladic left the settlement but he found the life of a fugitive increasingly perilous. He was by now a forgotten figure, and his friends had all retired. Serbian voters were weary of isolation and leaning towards the European Union. New elections in 2008 put reformists in the ministries and in charge of national security. 


Pressure on Mladics family meant that both his sons and daughter-in-laws careers were jeopardized. But no family member was going to betray Mladic. They had the support of Russias Federal Security Bureau, the successor to the KGB. Serbia was an old Russian ally and Moscow saw him as a Slav military hero. 
Miodrag Rakic, the man tasked with leading the hunt for Mladic, suspected that the Russians gave money regularly to Mladics family to relieve the financial pressure on them. In 2008, Rakic and a colleague made a secret trip to the Hague tribunal, flying in a roundabout route. Once he returned, Rakic was told by one of Mladics supporters that his family would be in danger if he continued to cooperate with the court. 
Rakic denied he had anything to do with the court. The man silently drew a diagram of the Hague conference table, writing down the names of every person at that meeting, even indicating exactly where each was seated. Rakic was convinced that the FSB had the wherewithal to penetrate the Hague Tribunal. From then on till his death in 2014, he travelled with two bodyguards. 
Instead of withdrawing from the tribunal, Rakic took the daring step of confronting the Russians boldly. At a Moscow conference, he met Nikolai Patrushev, a former head of the FSB. 


Patrushev told him that orders to protect Mladic came from Putin himself. I will talk to my bosses and do what I can, he told Rakic. He kept his word and Russian support for the Mladic family dropped off. Now, the former general was truly alone. He was finally cornered in the old farmhouse of his cousin Branislav in a northern Serbian village. 
Though quite ill after suffering a stroke, he refused to see a doctor, and allowed neither his son nor wife to visit. But in 2008, Darko brought his two children there while returning from a party at another cousins house. He didnt know that policemen in civvies were trailing him. 
Twenty days later, plain clothes police from a special war crimes unit raided the cousins houses. Inside Branislavs house, one upstair door was hard to open. They forced it open to see an old man in a black baseball cap standing behind the door. When they checked his identity, it said Ratko Mladic. 
Youve finally found who youre looking for, the man said defiantly. His machine pistol was found lying among dirty socks at the bottom of a wardrobe. Attempts to stall Mladics trial to the Hague on health grounds failed, and his trial began in June 2011. A Belgrade judge granted the generals request to visit the grave of his daughter Ana. 
Mladics trial was expected to conclude early this year. But errors by the prosecution caused the judge to pause the trial, saying that UN judges at the Hague would analyse the scope and full impact of the prosecutors error and try to set a new starting date for the trial as soon as possible

## Title: Connecting people to nature

Connecting people to nature
	
World Environment Day (WED) is one of the most widely celebrated global days that inspires the general public towards being environmental conscious. Hence, the United Nations (UN) seeks to focus the worlds attention on the environment and organizes positive environmental action programmes and initiatives on 5th June every year, since 1972. This years theme is Connecting People to Nature, and it encourages seven billion people to understand and explore nature, appreciating its natural beauty. It provides the message that every person on this earth has an implied responsibility to utilise the limited resources of nature for multifarious purposes with more care, understating the fact that every activity of a person will directly impact Mother Nature either positively or negatively.

"The time has arrived to connect 20 million of people with the nature, extending multifarious awareness program in different level from top to bottom ..."
This years WED is more important for Sri Lanka with the recent tragedy of the Meethotamulla Garbage Mountain on April 14, 2017, causing approximately 40 deaths, engulfing 130 houses and 1,100 families. The major reasons for this incident are identification of incorrect dumpsites, improper site management and encroachments to risk/buffer zone area by the general public. A similar incident had taken place on April 24, 2008, followed by the eruption of a large mass of solid waste, which engulfed 100 houses, causing the deaths of three people at the previous dumpsites at Bloemendhal.
Currently, Sri Lanka is experiencing Southwest Monsoon (May-September) rain, causing flooding and landslides in many areas of the island. Predominantly Matara, Galle, Kalutara, Ratnapura, Hambantota, Gampaha, Kegalle and Colombo Districts were badly affected, triggering more than 212 deaths, 79 missing and 93 injured. Total number of affected people are approximately 604,713 while 8,473 houses were damage and 157,177 families displaced as on 04.06.2017. Similar calamity had occurred during the period of April/May 2016 as well.
improper management of solid waste is one of the common causes for both calamities.According to my research (2014), approximately 57% female and 43.3% males were affected by different health issues around the dumpsites. 65.5% children, 75% waste pickers and 70% waste collectors/vehicle drivers have been affected by multiple health issues, due to the direct contact with waste dumpsites and related activities.
The major reason behind this situation is stakeholders failing to connect with nature, discharging their individual fiduciary duties as citizens of this nation towards the environment. Therefore, both hazards have turned into a disaster. Although, the Constitution provides a Provision (Sec.14 of Article 27) to protect, preserve and improve the environment for the benefit of the people, various governments in office since 1977 have been attempting to shift their economic policies to meet ever increasing trend of demand, implementing various development projects, without paying much attention to nature, which supports our own prosperity and well-being. This is very hard to be valued in terms of money.
I believe that improper management of solid waste is one of the common causes for both calamities. Approximately 6,400-7,000 MT of waste per day is generated in Sri Lanka with the annual growth rate of 1.2%. The urban areas are responsible for 80% of it. Out of this, the daily waste collection by local authorities is estimated at 2,500 MT (Central Environmental Authority, 2014). The rest ends up in water bodies, cannels, roads, public places and open burning especially in the village areas.

	A cohesive strategy that encourages sustainable use of resources should be implemented towards sustainable consumption and production needed
	
	
	Approximately 57% female and 43.3% males were affected by different health issues around the dumpsites.
	
	
	The major reason behind this situation is stakeholders failing to connect with nature
	
	
	Govts shift economic policies without understanding nature...
	
	
	Improper management of solid waste is one of the common causes for both calamities.
	
	
	57% female and 43.3% males were affected by different health issues around the dumpsites.
	

"65.5% children, 75% waste pickers and 70% waste collectors/vehicle drivers have been affected by multiple health issues... "

Hence, the time has arrived to connect 20 million people with nature, extending multifaceted awareness programme in different levels from top to bottom and strictly implementing existing environmental related laws towards a positive change.A single body cannot achieve this target alone; rather all stakeholders should gather under one umbrella to make a constructive and sustainable change in the future.
Accordingly, progressing towards sustainability requires changes to individual behaviour and mindsets of general public; but also requires structural changes, such as better choices and even less consumption as well as more efficient green production and consumption. Effective policy instruments can help in shaping these. The Government must have policy instruments to influence the operations or behaviours to achieve complex environmental, social and economic challenges.
In addition, a cohesive strategy that encourages sustainable use of resources should be implemented towards sustainable consumption and production. Private companies should also be encouraged to invest wisely in a new Green Production, while developing a socially responsible status with its consumers.


"A single body cannot achieve this target alone; all stakeholders should gather under one umbrella to make a constructive and sustainable change ..."

They can implement a code of practice pertaining to green growth and environmental protection to ensure that all their business processes abide by this practice. Civil society can play a significant role by independently monitoring all parties involved, raising awareness on resources consumptions and supporting grassroots initiatives. Further, the Government should take initiatives to extend an islandwide survey to identify the high risk areas for human settlements and to be provided a viable solution for them.
Eventually, behavioural change from the top to bottom towards a better environment should be initiated by the government, integrating all the stakeholders into a centre point and empowering them to formulate necessary policy measures towards a better environment for future generation.

"Behavioural change from the top to bottom towards a better environment should be initiated by the government, integrating all..."

Disaster Centres to be set up for displaced people
	
Disaster Centres with all facilities would be set-up throughout the country to shelter people who have to evacuate from their houses in disaster situations such as flood or landslides, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said today.
He said that three such centres were being constructed in the Badulla, Gampaha and Kegalle districts with the assistance of the Asian Development Fund.
The Minister said people who were usually sheltered in temples and schools in disaster situations could in future, be sheltered in disaster centres.
He said a long term programme should be implemented to address natural disasters in the country and added that a team of experts from the Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA) would arrive in the country for this purpose, at the end of this month.
He said several factors such as population increase and clearing of hilly areas for cash crops had aggravated the recent natural disasters in the country. (By Ajith Siriwardana)

The move came after Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain severed their ties with Qatar on Monday, accusing it of supporting terrorism, opening up the worst rift in years among some of the most powerful states in the Arab world.
Emirates said the last flight from Dubai to Doha will depart at 2:30 am on Tuesday, while the last flight from Doha to Dubai will depart at 3:50 am.
"All customers booked on Emirates' flights to and from Doha will be provided with alternative options, including full refunds on unused tickets and free rebooking to the nearest alternate Emirates destinations," the airline said in an email. (NDTV)

fifteen dead as explosions rock funeral in tense Kabul
	

At least 15 Afghans were killed when three back-to-back explosions ripped through a funeral Saturday for one of the demonstrators killed during anti-government protests Friday, authorities said. 
About 700 mourners at a hillside cemetery in the northern part of Kabul were in the middle of the funeral prayers for a prominent politicians son when three suicide bombers among the mourners detonated explosives, Abdullah Abdullah, the nations chief executive, who was at the service, said at a news conference. 
The blasts left body parts scattered among the dead, witnesses said. Around 80 people were injured, including some high-ranking Afghan officials. A spokesman for the Interior Ministry said that the death toll was 15, but it is expected to rise. 
People were standing to pray when the three blasts happened, said one of the mourners, Tahir Gardoon, a professor of political science at Khurshid University. People were screaming, running, everywhere was fear. 
Continued unrest could paralyze and further weaken Ghanis government, which is facing internal divisions and struggling to contain an aggressive Taliban insurgency and regional militants linked to the Islamic State, experts say. 
The Taliban has denied responsibility for both Wednesdays truck bomb blast and Saturdays attack, but the government blames Wednesdays blast on the Haqqani network, seen as the operational wing of the Taliban.

Four countries cut links with Qatar over 'terrorism' support
	
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain have broken off diplomatic relations and all land sea and air contacts with fellow Gulf Arab state Qatar, in the regions most serious diplomatic crisis in years.
Saudi Arabia on Monday said the move was necessary to protect the kingdom from what it described as terrorism and extremism. The kingdom also pulled all Qatari troops from the coalition fighting the ongoing war in Yemen.
The official state news agency, citing an official source, said Saudi Arabia had decided to sever diplomatic and consular relations with Qatar proceeding from the exercise of its sovereign right guaranteed by international law and the protection of national security from the dangers of terrorism and extremism.
Saudi Arabia cut all land air and sea contacts with Qatar and urges all brotherly countries and companies to do the same.
The decision comes after Qatar alleged in late May that hackers took over the site of its state-run news agency and published what it called fake comments from its ruling emir about Iran and Israel. Its Gulf Arab neighbors responded with anger, blocking Qatari-based media, including the Doha-based satellite news network Al-Jazeera.
Qatar is home to the sprawling al-Udeid Air Base, which is home to the US militarys Central Command and some 10,000 American troops. It wasnt clear if the decision would affect American military operations. Central Command officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Qatar long has faced criticism from its Arab neighbors over its support of Islamists. The chief worry among them is the Muslim Brotherhood, a Sunni Islamist political group outlawed by both Saudi Arabia and the UAE as it challenges the nations hereditary rule.
Gulf countries led by Saudi Arabia fell out with Qatar over its backing of then-Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi, a Brotherhood member. In March 2014, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain recalled their ambassadors from Qatar over the rift.
Eight months later, they returned their ambassadors as Qatar forced some Brotherhood members to leave the country and quieted others. However, the 2014 crisis did not see a land and sea blockade as threatened now.
In the time since, Qatar repeatedly and strongly denied it funds extremist groups. However, it remains a key financial patron of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip and has been the home of exiled Hamas official Khaled Mashaal since 2012.
Western officials also have accused Qatar of allowing or even encouraging funding of Sunni extremists like al-Qaidas branch in Syria, once known as the Nusra Front.
The crisis also comes after US President Donald Trumps recent visit to Saudi Arabia for a summit with Arab leaders. Since the meeting, unrest in the region has grown.
Bahrains foreign affairs ministry issued a statement early Monday saying it would withdraw its diplomatic mission from the Qatari capital of Doha within 48 hours and that all Qatari diplomats should leave Bahrain within the same period.
The ministrys statement said Qatari citizens needed to leave Bahrain within two weeks and that air and sea traffic between the two countries would be halted. It wasnt immediately clear how that would affect Qatar Airways, one of the regions major long-haul carriers.
Bahrain blamed Qatars media incitement, support for armed terrorist activities and funding linked to Iranian groups to carry out sabotage and spreading chaos in Bahrain for its decision.
The UAEs state news agency WAM reported the Emirates cut ties and gave diplomats 48 hours to leave the country, citing their support, funding and embrace of terrorist, extremist and sectarian organisations.
Egypt announced the closure of its airspace and seaports for all Qatari transportation to protect its national security.
Egypt cut ties with Qatar, accusing the Gulf Arab state of supporting terrorist organisations including the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypts state news agency reported.
Qatar had no immediate comment.(The Guardian)

London attackers kill seven, May says enough is enough
	

British Prime Minister Theresa May called on Sunday for a stronger response to Islamist extremism after three attackers drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbed others nearby, killing seven people and injuring 48.
Londons Metropolitan Police arrested 12 people in the Barking district of east London in connection with the attack and raids were continuing there, the force said.
The attack occurred five days before a parliamentary election and was the third to hit Britain in less than three months. May said the vote would go ahead as planned on Thursday.
It is time to say enough is enough, the Conservative leader said in a televised statement outside her Downing Street office, where flags few at half-mast.
We cannot and must not pretend that things can continue as they are, May said, calling for a beefed-up counter-terrorism strategy that could include longer jail sentences for some offences and new cyberspace regulations.
Less than two weeks ago, a suicide bomber killed 22 children and adults at a concert by U.S. singer Ariana Grande in Manchester in northern England. In March, in a attack similar to Saturdays, five people died after a man drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in central London and stabbed a policeman.
On Saturday night, police shot dead the three male assailants in the Borough Market area near London Bridge within eight minutes of receiving the first emergency call shortly after 10 p.m.

The Sri Lanka Air Force said its Mi-17 helicopter, which was forced to land in a flooded area in Baddegama on May 29 after a technical failure, during rescue and relief operations will be removed from service.
An SLAF source said the Air Force usually did not operate helicopters which had crashed or forced to land on water.
It had deployed seven Mi-17 helicopters, three Bell-212 helicopters and one Bell-412 helicopter for relief and rescue operations during the recent landslide and flood disaster.
However, no casualties were reported in the accident and all crew members on board the helicopter escaped unhurt.
The helicopter was dismantled and the parts removed to the Koggala Air Force camp for repairs.
Meanwhile, SLAF Spokesman Gihan Senaviratne said he could not comment on the matter because of an ongoing inquiry.
Mi-17 is a medium twin-turbine Russian transport helicopter designed for troop transport and supply operations and was inducted to the SLAF in 1993. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

No trade union reps in Health Min Disaster Management Comm.- GMOA
	
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne has ordered not to involve Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) or any other trade union to the ministrys disaster management committee meeting to prevent ministrys disaster management process shortcomings from being exposed, claimed GMOA today.
Addressing a press briefing GMOA's Assistant Secretary Dr. Samantha Ananda said the ministry had decided not to involve any trade union after the GMOA exposed that there was a shortage of Dextran medicinal drug to Dengue patients.
Dr. Samantha Ananda said during the last Disaster Management committee meeting, where all the experts met, the ministrys Medical Supplies Division (MSD) director acknowledged that there is a shortage in Dextran.
However, the minister is denying the fact. the Health Ministry is not prepared to act in a disaster situation. It took more than eight days for them to start the health assistance. The Health Minister and the officials have neglected their prime responsibility without keeping sufficient drugs in their medical storage facilities. June and July is anyway shows a hike in dengue patients. They were not prepared even for this situation, he said.
Dr. Samantha Ananda said removing trade unions from the disaster committee is not an answer to the disaster situation as it was the GMOA who started giving the medical assistance soon after the disaster occurred.
He said as a professional body, GMOA has exposed the lapses in the disaster management process to the health officials, however without rectifying the situation the minister and the officials are attempting to silent the GMOA to cover their shortcomings.
Further, he said the GMOA was able to reveal the lapses of the ministrys disaster management process as they have participated in previous meetings. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Olympic Silver Medal: Susanthika suspends auction sale
	
Following President Maithripala Sirisena's intervention, Olympic medalist Susanthika Jayasinghe has decided to put on hold her decision to auction the silver medal she won in the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
She told Daily Mirror that an officer from presidential secretariat had informed her over the phone that the President would look into the matter.
Ms. Jayasinghe said the Sports Minister had suspended her salary since April, and therefore she decided to auction her silver medal.
She is an adviser to the sports ministry but she complained that she had not even given a place to work at the ministry.
The minister accuses of me for obtaining a salary without working. Though I was appointed an adviser, I have not been told what to do. The ministry is not making use of my talents, Ms. Jayasinghe said.
She said the Sport Minister knows only to sling mud at her and has charged that she was attempting to settle down in Australia after selling the medal.
If I want to settle abroad, I would have chosen US as I have a multiple visa for myself and my child. I want to stay in Sri Lanka. However, what I said was that if Sri Lanka does not value my talents, it is better to work even as a labourer in Australia where I won the medal, Ms. Jayasinghe said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

## Title: Patthana  Dharma Sabhawa: The Pioneer in Abhidhamma Education

Patthana  Dharma Sabhawa: The Pioneer in Abhidhamma Education
	
Prince Siddhartha was born 2641 years ago at Lumbini. The parents of the royal prince were King Suddhodana of Kapilavasthu and Queen Mahamaya.
The prince led a life full of luxuries unimaginable in ordinary sense. However, he soon realized that the world he experienced at the royal palace was far from the reality and the world outside was all full of suffering including old age, disease and death and he too would have to perish one day from this suffering. With this knowledge, he left the royal palace forever at the prime age of 29. His renunciation had no parallel in the history of mankind.
This was the turning point in the spiritual development of humans as well as the Devas. After training under several teachers, he soon realized that the religious knowledge of that era was not leading him to the ultimate truth, ending the suffering that he was looking for. So finally, he decided to look for this ultimate truth by himself. For another six years, he tried the other extremity of subjecting the body to extreme pain thinking that this would result in liberation. Ultimately, he realized that this path too was not going to deliver the results he was looking for. Finally, he gave up both extremes of giving too much of pleasure and too much of pain to the body and decided to follow the middle path. 
On the Full Moon Day of Vesak, sitting under the Bodhi tree at Gaya, he finally realized the ultimate supreme truth and the end to Samsara by eradicating all the defilements by his own effort without any supernatural help and this was the appearance of Gothama the Buddha, the Enlightened One. Having realized the supreme enlightenment and perfect knowledge, he spent the next 45 years of his life, teaching the humans and devas the Dhamma he personally apprehended, thereby helping them too, to the final liberation. There are 84,000 recorded sermons delivered by Buddha, starting from Dhammachakkappavatthana Suttha which was delivered two full moons later to the five ascetics at Benares and the last was Maha Parinibbana Suttha delivered just before his final passing away. 
This vast collection of Buddhas teaching was subsequently catalogued into three large volumes, at the first Convention of Bhikkhus, headed by Arahanth Maha Kashyapa and attended by 500 Arahanths including Arahanths Upali and Ananda, held three months after the Buddhas passing away. They are, the Vinaya Pitaka, dealing with the discipline of the Sangha,the Suthra Pitaka, the random sermons explaining various aspects of Dhamma depending on the situation and explaining the Dhamma to suit the audience and the occasion, and finally, the Abhidhamma Pitaka, the deep Dhamma explaining the Absolute Realities (Paramattha Dhamma). 


The Abhidhamma explains all the physical and mental phenomena (Nama / Rupa) at the minutest detail, how they are formed, exist and pass away. The four Absolute Realities namely; mind (citta), mental formations (chethasika), physical phenomena (rupa) and Nibbana are dealt here and this deep analysis of the finer details of phenomena is not found in any other religious teaching or scientific literature anywhere. The Law of Cause and Effect or Dependent Origination (Hethu Phala Dharmaya), explaining the inter relationship of all these phenomena and the law of Kamma too are dealt with here extensively. 
In early and mid-20th century, Abhidhamma was practically little known in Sri Lanka except for among a few scholars who had the knowledge of Pali language. It was during this time that Most Rev. Yagoda Dhammaprabha Thera went to Myanmar (then Burma) and learned Tripitakaya, practice of tranquility (Samatha) and vipassana (Insight) meditation and most importantly, detailed learning of Abhidhamma with special attention to Patthana Dharmaya which is the most difficult part of the Abhidharmaya to comprehend. For this, he had to undergo extensive training under the forest dwelling scholar monks of that country, under trying conditions that existed at that time. While in Myanmar he was trained in Tripitaka at the Tripitaka College, Abhidharma and Patthanaya at Patthana Ashram and extensive meditation training at Sasana Seytha Bhavana Ashram. 


"In early and mid-20th century, Abhidhamma was practically little known in Sri Lanka except for among few scholars who had the knowledge of Pali language"

On his return to Sri Lanka in 1961 he formed The PATTHANA DHARMA SABHAWA with the help of fellow erudite bhikkhus and lay devotees. Among those who were associated with him in establishing the Dhamma Sabhava were, the Most Rev Prof. Rerukane Chandawimala Maha Nayaka Thera and Agga Maha Panditha Balangoda Ananda Maithriya Maha Nayaka Thera. He shared the extensive knowledge he gained, both in Sri Lanka and Myanmar, to teach the tranquillity and insight meditation and most importantly, the teaching of Patthana Dharmaya in simple language. 
He also coordinated annual Patthana recitation at the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi premises, Anuradhapura, during the Poson season. It is worthy to mention here that Buddha spent the first seven weeks after enlightenment in and around the Bodhi tree at Buddha Gaya spending time recapitulating the vast knowledge and wisdom he gained in the process of attaining Buddhahood. He spent the 4th week in a special enclosure (Rathanaghara) done by devas, going through the Abhidharmaya and towards the latter part of this period, while recapitulating Patthana Dharmaya, the six coloured halo (Shad Varna Buddha rashmi mala) appeared around Buddha due to the extensive joy he experienced as a result of the realization of the depth of the dhamma he comprehended. The Patthana Dharma Sabhava is continuing this recitation of Patthana Dharmaya at Anuradhapura, immediately preceding the Poson full moon day, uninterrupted for the past 56 years. 


The Maha Thera also went to all corners of the country, conducting dharma desana, meditation training of fellow bhikkhus and lay devotees and most importantly propagating Abhidhamma and Patthanaya. The most Rev Yagoda Dharmaprabha Thera spent the latter part of his life in writing Dhamma books in simple Sinhala language so that Dhamma reached the ordinary people who were not conversant in Pali. Some of the books that were authored by the Maha Thera include Vidarshana Guru Potha, Patthana Desana Saraya, Patthana Dharani Panna Vibhanga Varaya, Visuddhi Vipassana and Sitha Sirura saha Nivana hevath Dhamma Sangani.  Rev Dhammaprabha Thera was honoured by The Most Ven. Maha Nayaka of the Malwatta Chapter of the Siam Maha Nikaya, Amunugama Rajaguru Sri Vipassi Maha Nayaka Thera by conferring the saasanika title ABHIDHAMMIKA VAGISHVARA, in recognition of the relentless service he had done to promote and re-establish Abhidhamma in Sri Lanka. The title was presented by the Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake on 17th December, 1965. 


Most Ven Yagoda Dharmaprabha Nayaka Thera passed away on 18th April 1993 as if to prove that everyone that was born had to die one day (Uppajjithva Nirujjanthi). This inevitably created a void that was almost impossible to fill. However, his erudite pupil Rev. Korathota Wessabhu Thera stood up to the challenge and took over the mantle of the Dharma Sabhawa and performed the most difficult task of continuing the unfinished work started by late Maha Thera and further expanding the promotion of the religious and educational activities. It is noteworthy to mention that he was one of the 10 children ordained at the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi premises in Buddha Gaya on the 14th March 1982 by the late Thera. 

The activities conducted currently by the Dharma Sabhawa include: 

1. Conduction of Abhidhamma classes and training the students for Abhdharmacharya and Abhidharma Visharadha degrees 
2. Tripitaka Education 
3. Conduction of Pali classes 
4. Poya day meditation programmes and the Thesaththa Gnana Dhamma desana series conducted by Rev Korathota Wessabhu Thera 
5. Vipassana meditation programmes on every Wednesday conducted by Rev Kalubowila Amathagaveshi Thera (formerly, Mr Keerthie Adaasuriya). 
6. Annual Patthana Dharma Recitation at Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi Premises, Anuradhapura. 
7. Conducting annual Abhidharma conventions with the participation of erudite Abhidhamma Teachers. 
8. Provision of scholarships annually to poor students in remote areas. 
9. Publication of Dhamma books and booklets regularly 
10. Provision of accommodation to resident monks and also visiting monks from remote monasteries, travelling to Colombo for their medical needs 
11. Provision of accommodation and other basic facilities for student monks from remote monasteries who enrol in Colombo based Pirivenas and other educational institutes. 
Patthana Recital in progress at Anuradhapura. 
12. Regular meditation retreats conducted at the Bodhi Grama Bhavana Temple, Aluthgama Bogamuwa, Yakkala. 
In addition to improving these services, the Dharma Sabhawa is planning to establish a fully equipped library and a project to preserve the rare Dhamma texts and the Pali canon. 
The Dhamma Sabhawa will be conducting the annual Patthana recital this year too at Anuradhapura, in a special enclosure built to the north west of Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, near the Rathanagaharaya on the 4th, 5th and 6th of June 2017 from 6.00 pm to 10.00 pm. Also, the Patthana Dharmaya will be explained in simple language during the procedure. There will be Seela Bhavana programmes on the 5th and 6th to be conducted concurrently. All are welcome to attend, dressed in simple white. 
May you realise the supreme bliss of Nibbana in this very existence itself. May all beings be well, happy and contented.

Removing cancer causing Chromium from water
	
Ravindu and Sankalpa of S.De.S. Jayasinghe Central College, Dehiwala shine at Intel-ISEF at Los Angeles
Project is about removing carcinogenicchromium ions from natural water sources

There is a disgraceful misjudgement that exists in the Sri Lankan society that always measures skill by the school that one is attends. Many among us seem to think that children, who go to reputed schools hold far more talent than the rest, who attend schools that do not hold such popular reputations in society. Sankalpa and Shehan are two students who have proven this theory wrong against all odds and barriers by showing us that talent can be found in every school and that each school is worth its weight in gold as long as the school has a Principal with good leadership qualities, dedicated teachers and hardworking students. 
The duo with their medals

As two students of the grade 13 AL class in the science stream of S.De.S. Jayasinghe Central College, Dehiwala, Ravindu Sankalpa Perera and Shehan Kavishka have exemplified their talents and emerged triumphant in securing the grand award in 4th place in the earth and environmental science category at Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (Intel-ISEF), 2017 held at Los Angeles, California, this year with their project based on removing carcinogenic chromium ions from our natural water sources.

This international competition hosted 1,778 contestants from 78 countries. Our young Sri Lankans stood as the proud reason for our nations flag to be hoisted up all high and mighty amidst international applause bringing recognition not only to themselves but to our mother land as well making all of us Sri Lankans glow with pride. 
Sri Lankan students have been participating in this competition over the past 10 years, but this year is the first time that such a victory has been bestowed on our country and so this victory will be marked on this years calendar as a golden moment and will go down in history as a memorable achievement. In addition to the grand award, Shehan and Sankalpa were also awarded the Mawhibas special award for their experiment. 
There were undoubtedly many helping hands that supported them all the way throughout this journey and hence those people also share the happiness no different from the victors. 
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, the Principal of S.De.S. Jayasinghe Central College P.P.D.C. Pathirana expressed his happiness. 
Our school history goes back to about 71 years. This is the biggest victory we have achieved so far in the 71 years. These two students have brought glory not just to our school but also to our country. I have been principal of this school for a period of three and a half years and Im glad to have witnessed this great achievement during my time as principal. 


Its all thanks to the dedication of our students and guidance of our teachers. We hope to continue creating young inventors and help them excel in different fields not just in science, he said. 
Sankalpa and Shehan hope to sit for the G.C.E. AL examination this August. Managing time between studies and their experiments would have been quite a tedious challenge and an impossible feat itself, if not for the support and encouragement they got from their school teachers. 
We spoke to the teacher in charge Gayani Samarasinghe about the support given to the students during their journey as she had been with the students since day one of this effort. 
I directed Shehan and Sankalpa to Dr. Meththika Vithanage, who works in the National Institute of Fundamental Studies which is based in Kandy. There she provided our students with the lab facilities, accommodation and she also guided and supervised them throughout. Our students would not have been able to achieve all of this if not for her help and guidance. 
Our students had to conduct their experiments in Kandy which meant that they had to miss out on school. We tried to arrange the dates in such a way so that the students could go to Kandy during vacation holidays and reduce the days that they had to miss school. But on the occasion that they missed out on their lessons, we conducted extra classes for them so that they could keep in touch with their studies. 
Ravindu and Sankalpa

We also took them for science society seminars and workshops that would help them in their research and experiments. 
Sankalpa and Shehan had to participate in different qualification rounds of the contest before making it to the finale in LA. 
According to the teacher in charge, it all started with the science research project competition organised by the National Science Foundation where Shehan and Sankalpa represented their college and surpassed talent from 800 schools and won first place for their project proposal. 
Next our students participated in the National Science and Engineering Fair where they won 2nd place for their project. The first three contenders were to take part in the INTEL-ISEF 2017 and our students were qualified to take part in the international competition hosted in Los Angeles. 
However, the road to success was not easy.  The experience has indeed been a thrilling one for our Lankan inventors and we spoke to Shehan and Sankalpa about their thought regarding the victory. 
When they were asked where they got their idea for their experiment that was to filter out carcinogenic chromium ions from our drinking water, this is what Shehan had to say. 
It is a common problem today. Chromium is mostly used by leather manufacturing industries. In a developing country like ours, we have no technology to dispose of the toxic waste in industrial effluents and so the normal procedure is to release it into natural water sources. This water is used by local residents for their daily activities including drinking purposes. Chromium ion is carcinogenic. 

"Its all thanks to the dedication of our students and guidance of our teachers. ..."


So, we chose to experiment under this topic conducting research and to come up with a solution with the technology available to us. 
Like all happy occasions, this was one where emotions could not be expressed with words. 
Our hopes got fulfilled in an unexpected way. We started our research with the hope of reaching the final competition in America as we had never gone abroad. It was a great feeling to get there and it felt even greater when we got the award. Said Sankalpa. 
We got a lot of experience that we will remember throughout our lives. The US was different and we learnt a lot. Hearing our countrys name being announced and seeing our countrys flag being hoisted at the event made me feel so proud and happy. I cant really express my feelings in words, said a very happy Shehan his voice giving away his joy. 
The achievement of such a victory did not make them forget the people who became their pillars of strength throughout their journey. Sankalpa and Shehan, extended their heartfelt gratitude and sincere thanks to everyone who supported them. 
We would like to thank the National Science Foundation for organising such competitions. We would like to thank our principal and all our teachers including our teacher in charge, Ms. Gayani Samarasinghe, for always checking on us, guiding us and staying behind us giving us encouragement and support. 
We would both like to especially thank Dr. Meththika Vithanage who guided us throughout our research and experiment. She provided the lab facilities for us which was in Kandy. And while we were in Kandy she provided us with food, accommodation and guidance. Last but not least, we would like to thank our parents for always being there for us.

TEHRAN AFP June4, 2017 -Iran on Sunday joined the international chorus of criticism against President Donald Trumps decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, saying it would further isolate the United States. 
The withdrawal of the United States from the Paris accord indicates the governments lack of responsibility regarding the global community and it will increasingly isolate them, foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi said, according to the IRNA news agency. 
Trump announced on Thursday that the United States would withdraw from the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change, joining Syria and Nicaragua as the only non-signatories to the agreement.
