Man?s inhumanity to an innocent eagle
	
A photograph in which some men are seen attempting to kill an eagle in an inhumane manner after peeling off its skin and cutting off its legs has gone viral on social media and news websites.
Commenting on the matter, two wildlife organizations, ?Freedom Sri Lanka Foundation? and the ?Let Them Live? said they would take measures to charge the culprits with inhumane animal slaughter under the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance (No.22) of 2009.
?There are five men in the picture. We have identified the men as residents of Wanchawala in Galle. They are engaged in this inhumane act as a hobby. The eagle is an endangered and protected species and cannot be killed or sold,? Shashikalana Ratwatte said on behalf of the wildlife organisations.
He said they have requested the Wildlife Department to take action against the culprits.
The organisations requested people to inform them on phone number 070-3303022 and 071-3664019 in case they had any information on the men seen in the photograph.
Meanwhile, the Wildlife Department said they were in the process of taking legal action against the culprits and added that they could be jailed for up to five years if found guilty. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Nelum Pokuna looks like a commode: CBK
	
Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga today said that the Nelum Pokuna performance theatre, in Colombo was an ?eyesore? that looks like a ?commode? (Kakkussi Pochchiya) and blamed the former Rajapaksa government of changing the initial concept she had of creating a public cultural centre.
?The Nelum Pokuna constructed looks ugly like a toilet commode. Sorry for saying it. Every day when I come out of the house I see it. It is a real eyesore. The initial idea was very beautiful. We created a public cultural centre there. Now there?s no people or anyone there. Even the toilets cannot be used properly,? she said addressing the International Women?s Day Ceremony of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party as the Chief Guest.
Claiming that no one was allowed to rob public funds during her tenure, she said today the country was now facing an economic crisis because of the robbing and corruption committed by the Mahinda Rajapaska?s regime.
?The country?s economy has broken down because of the blatant robbery by the previous government. I initiated six development projects including the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway, Colombo-Southern Expressway. The Coal Power Plant launched by my government with a reputed Chinese Company at an estimated cost US$240 million but the agreement was changed after my exit from office. The Mahinda Rajapaksa regime demanded commissions from the Chinese company. But because it was disagreeable the contract was signed with a little known company.
Ms. Kumaratunga said this was the first time after ten years that she addressed the SLFP women's gathering because Mr. Rajapaksa had not allowed her to interact with SLFP members.
?During past ten years, party members including ministers and deputy ministers of his government had to face various problems when they maintained links with me,? she said and added that CID officers visited some SLFPers the following day if they had met her for any reason at all.
?I am not greedy for power. I never dragged Mahinda?s leg after he became the President. Despite many circumstances where I should raise my voice against them, I had to remain silent for ten years. The freedom under this government is palpable, which was the wish of the majority of the citizens? regardless of political affiliation,? Ms. Kumaratunga said.
Meanwhile, she said Sri Lankan women should be more knowledgeable to compete with the Sri Lankan men in every field especially in politics.
She said 25% representation for women in local government bodies is insufficient and hoped the present government would increase it to 50%. (Piyumi Fonseka)

PM proposes to increase VAT to 15%
	
Blaming the ?Rajapaksa Regime? of putting the country into a debt trap of nine trillion rupees Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe making a special statement in Parliament today said the government would increase the Value Added Tax (VAT) to 15 per cent, re-introduce capital gains tax and introduce several other tax reforms to face the challenges ahead.
He said a flat statutory income tax rate of 17.5 per cent would be introduced.
Tax concessions granted on Telecommunication services, private education and health services would be removed. He said VAT would not be imposed on essential commodities and electricity while imposing it only on selected non essential commodities.
It was also announced that the proposal in the 2016 budget to increase nation building taxes to four per cent from the earlier two per cent would be suspended.
"Nothing done by the Rajapaksa Regime in the name of development, had provided any stimulus to uplift the economy. Hambanthota is a very good example. An airport was built but there are no airplanes. We are going back to China to talk about them. A harbour was built but with no ships. We are going back to China to talk about them. They did not have a plan to make use of this airport and harbour. At least no land had been reserved to even build an industrial zone around this port and airport. We went there and marked out the land for the first time.
?They only plunged the country into a debt trap. Because of the arrogant ways of the Rajapaksa Regime the country is in a debt trap of Rs.9.5 trillion. That means Rs.9,500 billion. Sometime it could even be as much as Rs.10,000 billion.
?The challenge before us now is to come out of this debt trap. I would like to emphasise that the foundation for that has been laid by the National Government. The majority opinion is that this challenge could be won by the National Government. The opinion of the International Community is also that. We like to state that many are looking at the way we are proceeding.
?The other challenge faced by us is the present global economic crisis. That is our second challenge. Therefore we have to minimize the impact on our country from the global economic crisis. On the other hand we have to come out of the impact of the debt trap.
?The oil prices in the world are decreasing today. Those who are saying that the fuel prices in the country should reduced because of that do not see the danger behind it. We like if we can completely reduce it. But there is a problem. On one hand the CPC is in debt to the tune of Rs.365 billion. Then we have to introduce a separate tax to pay that debt. On the other hand the economies of countries that depend on oil like Saudi Arabia, Oman, Jordan and Kuwait are facing problems. As a result job opportunities in those countries are reducing. The Sri Lankans doing jobs in those countries might even lose them. The salaries might become less. We should not forget this danger.
?The decrease in oil prices effects Russia as well. Not only will the number of Russian tourists coming to the country reduce, the demand for our tea in Russia has already decreased.
?The Middle Eastern region is in danger because of the ISI terrorists. It has badly affected our tea exports. Also if some incident happens it could affect the world economy and oil distribution.
?The recession in the Chinese economy could also be a disadvantage for us.
?If the European economy weakens it will affect our export earnings. If by some reason Britain leaves the European Union, it could be disadvantageous to us. Therefore we wish that it would not be so.
?The US Federal Reserve could increase interest rates. Once it did it. It has stopped it because it could create problems to the world economy. I think before the US Presidential election they could increase it to show their power. If that is done the interest on the debt we have to pay will also increase.
"For Sri Lanka the year 2016 will be an year which spells utmost diligence given the local and global conditions" the Prime Minister said
He said Sri Lanka should focus on maintaining an economic growth of six per cent and also should show the world that it can overcome any economic storm.
?We can revive this patient and we will revive her even by giving her bitter medicine," he said referring to the country's economy . The prime minister assured that the government would create an atmosphere where the people could lead happy and peaceful lives in the future," the Prime Minister said. (Yohan Perera)

Police said that a case of abetment to suicide was registered against retired Revenue Inspector Duraipandian, who was accused of having shouted at Ravindran to go ahead with his suicide plan.
During a periodical roll call on Sunday, Duraipandian had marked absent for Ravindran, who had gone out reportedly to attend on his son who was admitted to a hospital.
Ravindran had pleaded with Duraipandian not to mark him absent since it would affect his prospects of getting government benefits meant for the refugees. When Duraipandian refused to heed his plea, Ravindran climbed up a tower and touched a high-tension electric line and fell down dead. Leaders of various political parties and organisations staged a protest claiming that it was Duraipandian who drove Ravindran to commit suicide, and sought action against him. (Hindu)

SLC sacks selectors; Sanga in new Committee
	
Sri Lanka?s team for the T20 World Cup was shrouded in uncertainty just a day before it was to leave for India after the committee of selectors was unexpectedly disbanded for not complying with SLC?s selection policy on Monday night and new members appointed. ?
?
The new committee comprising Aravinda de Silva, Romesh Kaluwitharana, Ranjith Madurusinghe and Lalith Kaluperuma were sitting till late night to finalize the 15-man squad after skipper Lasith Malinga resigned as captain citing his knee injury. De Silva was named as the Chairman of the committee in a press release issued last night, which included former captain Kumar Sangakkara.?
?The appointment of the National Selection Committee was carried out by the Minister citing recent failures encountered by the National Team in their Tours to New Zealand, India, Asia Cup in Bangladesh and the inconsistency in the selection criteria,? the statement said.
Last month Sri Lanka Cricket announced identical teams led by Lasith Malinga for both the Asia Cup and the World Twenty20 despite the 32-year-old not having fully recovered from a recurring knee-injury sustained during the home series against West Indies last year. Malinga played only the opening game of the Asia Cup and was forced to sit out the entire series which Sri Lanka lost embarrassingly.
He missed Sri Lanka?s tour of New Zealand in December and January, and was later ruled out of the T20s in India, in February.?
The MRI scans of his injured knee have shown substantial damage. The physiotherapist has recommended ten days of rest, meaning that the 32-year-old paceman will not be available for any of the practice matches ahead of Sri Lanka?s opening clash on March 17.?
However, Malinga has offered to play if selected to the team. Sources said Malinga would now be replaced by Angelo Mathews as skipper but the former was likely to be retained in the squad as Sri Lanka looked to defend their title won two years ago in Bangladesh.?
Meanwhile, the new cricket selectors were discussing bringing in left-handed bat Lahiru Thirimanne and spinning all-rounder Seekkuge Prasanna in place of wicket-keeper bat Niroshan Dickwella and Jeffrey Vandersay. (Champika Fernando)

Asia?s regional life insurer maps  out where Sri Lanka is heading
	
AIA Sri Lanka CEO Shah Rouf speaking at the Fintelekt-LIMRA Insurance Summit 2016 last week provided a thoughtful perspective on the region?s market journey and how AIA?s unparalleled experience across Asia provides an insight to what the Sri Lankan industry and most importantly policyholders can expect.
?Asia is being shaped by growth in population and rapid urbanization. Increased disposable incomes bringing households new spending power, combined with low social welfare and a substantial protection gap, means Sri Lankans like all Asians need protection and long term savings? he said.?
He further added: ?The insurance agent would remain the main way to reach the customer with a growing contribution from other channels such as bancassurance, as has been the case in other Asian markets. However, to be accepted and successful in a growing tech savvy market, the modern agent would have to demonstrate and have access to advice tools comparable to the most developed markets. ?The pace of bancassurance growth across Asia has strong correlations to decreasing interest rates and thus core banking margins. Hence it might be some time before bancassurance becomes a significant channel for the Life insurance industry as a whole in Sri Lanka?.
Turning his attention to products, Shah emphasized the link between regulation and resulting product mix in markets. He said ?protection was the primary focus for most Life insurers and this was best balanced with long term savings to give policyholders a more complete solution. ?The extent to which this was met with a traditional or unit-linked underlying product structure varied from market to market?.?
Citing examples such as UK mortgage endowments, Hong Kong post Lehman Brothers 2008 and the Indian swing to and from linked products over the last decade, he said: ?Both structures had their pros and cons and regulation could push markets to one extreme or the other. What was needed was a balanced approach and particularly so in emerging Asian markets to encourage industry development?.?
He concluded by highlighting that in most emerging Asian markets bank deposits remain the sole or main financial services product and the customer needed much more than that. Later asking the question ?Can a bank savings account continue to save or provide a multiple of itself for the saver?s family; can it top itself up and in effect be re-used if it?s all spent on large medical expenses???

Duminda justifies Rs.21mn rental for ministry
	
Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said today the monthly rental of Rs. 21 million inclusive of the rental for a separate vehicle park for the ministry at a new building in Rajagiriya was not that excessive compared to the rentals of the ministries at the World Trade Centre (WTC).
The Cabinet last week approved a proposal by the ministry to relocate it to a building in Rajagiriya at a monthly rent of Rs. 21 million.
?We didn?t want to move out but we had to since we were asked to vacate the building to house the offices for oversight committees of Parliament,? he told the Daily Mirror.
He said the ministry had earlier requested for a fourth-floor space at the ?Sethsisripaya? new building to house the ministry but they were not given the required space.
?Therefore, we have to move out to another spacious building with about 90,000 square feet. There was no favoritism in choosing the building,? the minister said.
Minister Dissanayake said their intention was to house all the departments and authorities under the purview of the ministry located elsewhere in the new building.
?As a permanent solution to the issue, I have requested the Prime Minister to make provisions to construct a spacious building for the Ministry on the land which belongs to the ministry at Battaramulla,? he said.? (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The fair one had implored the yahapalanaya bigwig to help avoid the glare of media publicity that could cause her immense shame and dismay.?
