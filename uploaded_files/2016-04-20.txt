Arrest Gota: US Tamil groups write to Obama
	
In an urgent appeal to President Barrack Obama, two major Tamil groups in the US-Tamils for Obama and American Tamil Forum- had urged the US to arrest former Sri Lankan Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapakse who is reported to be currently visiting US, the World News Report reported on Wednesday.
According to United Nations internal review report around 70,000 Tamils were killed in six months during the early part of 2009 and the abuses committed by the Sri Lankan forces amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.
"US should not miss the opportunity to arrest and prosecute one of the main war criminals in recent times visiting the US. Failure to do so would encourage others to commit abuses amounting to war crimes" said these two organizations.
The UN Human Rights Council, led by the US, last year passed a Sri Lanka resolution to hold a credible investigation to punish those responsible for these killings.
"United States should take the same leadership it took at the UN to initiate investigation for the visiting Sri Lankan war criminal,? said these two organizations (EIN Presswire)

Centre denies rejecting TN plea for release of Rajiv assassins
	
The Central Government of India on Wednesday denied media reports that it has rejected a proposal by the Tamil Nadu government to free seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, the Hindustan Times reported today.
Reacting to a report published in The Hindu, the ministry of home affairs told CNN-IBN that no such decision has been taken because it was still consulting the law ministry in this regard.
The Hindu reported on Wednesday morning that the Centre has turned down the Jayalalithaa government?s proposal to free seven convicts ? namely V Sriharan, AG Perarivalan, T Suthendraraja, Jayakumar, Robert Payas, Ravichandran and Nalini. It quoted ministry officials as saying that as ?the matter is sub-judice in (the) Supreme Court, it has no authority to release the prisoners?.
Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and 14 others were killed on May 21, 1991, when a suicide bomber from the The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam blew herself up after touching his feet at an election rally in Sriperumbudur near Chennai.
The state government, in its letter to the Centre, stated that it has decided to remit the life terms of the convicts as they have ?already served imprisonment for 24 years?.

Minister Ratnayake met the CTED Executive Director as part of a continuing dialogue between the government of Sri Lanka and CTED. This was following a country visit by the Directorate to Sri Lanka earlier this month.
The Ministry said discussions centered around the revision of anti-terrorism legislation including technical assistance to draft comprehensive counter-terrorism legislation to replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act, in accordance with United Nations Human Rights Council Resolutions and in keeping with international best practices.
The Minister also reiterated the importance of updating the 2014 CTED interim report on Sri Lanka to reflect ground realities, incorporating the positive changes made since January 2015.
In welcoming Minister Ratnayake, Mr. Laborde had reiterated that Sri Lanka and CTED have had a long tradition of cooperation, and that his Directorate fully supported Sri Lanka?s renewed efforts to restore democracy and the Rule of Law. He said his team had concluded a fruitful visit to Sri Lanka, and appreciated the support and hospitality afforded by the Sri Lankan authorities, and the open and constructive nature of the discussions held during the visit.

NDB Wealth advises to plan for financial freedom this Avurudu
	
NDB Wealth CEO Prabodha Samarasekera (right) with the company?s Vice President Vindhya Jayasekera
?
The most auspicious time of year, the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, also popularly known as ?Aluth Avurudu?, is more than just a time for celebrations, feasting and visiting family and friends. With its roots in traditional harvest periods, it is a time that most people choose to take stock of the year gone past. And, at the same time, prepare oneself for a new year and a new beginning.
Keeping the goal of beginning anew in mind, expert financial planner NDB Wealth recommends that when you turn over a new leaf, don?t just do the same things over and over again, aim to make a true change for the better, with a better result in the offing. This means, more than anything, the achievement of true financial independence by making your hard-earned money finally work for you, instead of letting it idle in traditional bank deposits, because it is never too late to secure your financial freedom.
According to NDB Wealth CEO Prabodha Samarasekera, ?During this auspicious time of year, when you set aside the past and prepare for the future, the goal of financial freedom becomes even more relevant, especially when new beginnings are called for. You also need to prepare for those moments in life when a singular decision shapes your future, when a simple yes or no moves your life path in one direction or another. We all know these moments are coming but don?t always know when they?ll arrive. The question then becomes, how will you respond financially???
For example, to allow your hard-earned savings to reach its full potential, you may want to invest in the NDB Wealth ?Money Plus? money market fund as a beginning. It?s simple and easy-to-use and, as such, an ideal starting point, which also offers almost double what most banks savings accounts pay in Sri Lanka. Further, it allows you the added flexibility of withdrawing your money whenever you want to meet your needs.
Also on offer, the highly impactful NDB Wealth ?Income Plus? fund, an excellent alternative to traditional fixed deposits but with a higher rate of return, requiring a one-year commitment only. It is an ideal platform to build wealth for your future.
Importantly, both funds offer the added benefit of income being credited daily, so you can watch your investment grow, with all earnings being tax free to your hands.
?To aid you in preparing for a new beginning, or when any of life?s important milestones present themselves, we at NDB Wealth are pleased to offer assistance in choosing the right path for your future, helping advice you on the many new options available to maximise your earnings. All you have to do is call or visit us, or even go to www.ndbwealth.com, to partake in some free of charge, introductory financial planning advice from Sri Lanka?s top asset management company, as recognised by Global Banking & Finance Review in 2015,? Samarasekera added.
So, ?it?s time? to truly embrace the spirit of ?Aluth Avurudu? and finally target true financial freedom, ensuring your new beginning leads to a prosperous and happy future.

There could be a power crisis in 2018, Power Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said today.
?The Sampur coal power plant is to be completed by 2017 according to the long term construction plan. But it couldn?t be completed due to lots of reasons,? he said.
?The coal power plants cannot fulfil the electricity requirement in 2018 because of the increasing demand,? he said.
He said that as a result the Ministry was considering renewable energy sources.
?Three solar power plants of 100 MW each would be established in the Southern and Eastern Provinces and be connected to the national grid. The solar power plants could be completed within two years after calling tenders,? he noted.
He said in addition that another 300MW thermal power plant would be constructed at Kerawalapitiya as a first step and studies are underway to locate a suitable place in the Southern Province to build another power plant.
?Those plants will contribute 1000 GW to the national grid within two years,? he said.
Meanwhile, studies were now being conducted to find the best location for the construction of the Sampur coal power plant, Power Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said today.
While addressing the media briefing, Minister Siyambalapitiya said the power generation plants I, II and III at Sampur would be operational in near future. But he did not give specific dates of completion.
He said that the approved Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report, which was signed in 2008 had been received.
He said that the Ministry was considering a middle path for the power plant so that the damage to the environment would be minimal.
?A committee including environmentalists and CEB officials had been appointed to searching for the best location for the power plant in Trincomalee,? the Minister said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

A fair Diyawanna member, who faces the threat of forfeiting her seat in the august assembly over a ?personal problem?, was for some time working her way into the graces of a high political authority seeking his influence to sort out her problem.?
?
Finding that the expected help was not forthcoming, she has now begun running again after her mentor, a former political strongman, they say.
The fact that three other members hailing from her district have now been raised to higher status overlooking her, had made her realise that she had gone after the wrong person.
She had met the political authority on several occasions seeking his help and was inching towards the yahapalanaya to the chagrin of her camp mates. She had even absented herself from the House at the vote-taking on an important Bill taking no chance of incurring the displeasure of the high political authority - all in vain.

Taxes result of failed projects: Ranjan
	
The Government had to increase the taxes as a result of the unprofitable projects launched by the former Government, Social Empowerment and Welfare Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said today.
After the discussion held at the Temple Trees with the Prime Minister regarding the May Day rally, speaking to the media, Mr. Ramanayake said the Rajapaksa family had placed the country in heavy debt of nearly of Rs. 10 trillion, by implementing several unsuccessful projects, such as Noraichcholai Coal Power Plant, Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port, Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport and the Suriyawewa Cricket Stadium.
?In my view, as a politician and an artiste, taxes should not be implemented on people, who had suffered for years. Every Sri Lankan child comes to this world with a debt of Rs. 500,000. The Government is forced to increase taxes and it is not doing it deliberately. The Government does not intend to trouble already suffering people by imposing these taxes,? he said.
He said the President, and the Prime Minister would come to an appropriate decision regarding the tax increase after discussions. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

VAT won?t be added to water, electricity and medicine
	
The VAT (Value Added Tax) will not affect essential food commodities, medicinal drugs, water and electricity as requested by President Maithripala Sirisena, Acting Finance Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana said.
Minister Abeywardana addressing the weekly cabinet news briefing today, said Prime Minister Wickremesinghe met President Maitripala Sirisena last morning to discuss amendments to the tax reforms, following the President?s comments on Monday at Polonnaruwa that the average public will not be burdened by the VAT increase.
?The government has decided to increase the tax revenue to 20% of the GDP from the current 10% by 2020. There is a huge rise of state expenditure consequent to the increase of public servant's salaries, reduction of price of essential commodities and gas and power by the government. The government?s pension bill is also over Rs. 400 billion annually. Therefore, increase of tax for those who can afford it is unavoidable if we are to prevent a major collapse in the economy,? Minister Abeywardana stressed.
Sri Lanka?s traditional exports like tea, coconut and rubber has dropped due to economic and political turmoil in Russia, EU and the Middle East.
He said the VAT has been increased from 11% to 15% by May 2nd, this year but it will not be imposed on locally produced fruits, vegetables, fresh milk, drugs etc. Telecommunication services (land phones and hand phones) will also come under VAT.
Retail and wholesale trade will also be subjected to VAT while the ceiling for registration for VAT has been determined at Rs. 3 million for a quarter, Minister Abeywardana said.
All services provided by private hospitals and nursing homes will also come under VAT but not on drugs purchased from a private pharmacy or at Osu-Sala.
Minister Abeywardana said there will be a reduction in subsidies provided by the government and said that in real terms only 15,000 out of 77,000 taxable and 35,000 registered persons pay VAT now.
The government targets to bring down the budget deficit to 3.5% by 2017 from 5.9% in 2015.
The IMF has proposed a restructuring programme an a sound management for loss making state enterprises such as Sri Lankan and SLTB and the government was working on it. The World Bank and the Asian Development would start negotiating with Sri Lanka after the first tranche of 1.5 billion was released by the IMF within the next few weeks. (Sandun Jayasekera)
