Appreciation: Nimal De Silva  Gentleman par Excellence
	
It?s been a month since the demise of Nimal De Silva. Fellow Richmondite, chairman of Global Surgical products, Nimal, more importantly, was a loving father, a good husband and an amazing friend to many of us; a thoughtful, generous soul with a heart larger than life. A posthumous letter does little justice, but I feel that?s the least I could do to express how grateful I am to have known this wonderful human being.
Mawanana Hewa Nimal De Silva was born on 28th December 1946 in Ambalangoda to the late Mr and Mrs Edvin De Silva of Batapola was the fourth child of the family of five children. He did his primary education at Dharmashoka College and entered Richmond in 1966.?
After leaving Richmond he got the opportunity to join his brother, Sarath in Japan during the early seventies which I believe was the turning point of his life. A spirited, go-getter by nature, Nihal soon ventured into entrepreneurship and started his own business in Japan and was offered an honorary citizenship in Japan 1975. Nimal met the love of his life, Saeko, in 1978 and got married a few years later. The loving couple was blessed with two daughters.
Despite all the comforts he enjoyed in Japan being a true Sri Lankan he migrated back to Sri Lanka during late seventies and ventured into the garment and surgical products trade which became an instant success, providing employment for more than 200 employees to date. ?Japan? as he was known to his close friends was a charismatic, soft-spoken gentleman for all of his colleagues who associated him in the society particularly at Richmond College Old Boy Association, BRC and Royal Colombo Golf Club etc.? He spent a substantial portion of his wealth towards the welfare of the society including his alma mater, Richmond. He never questioned the cause; if someone was in need, he would simply give with no strings attached. His philanthropy, in fact, is reported to have been misused by some. During the year 2002 when I was desperately searching for temporary accommodation in Colombo, Nimal most graciously invited me to stay with him at his home in Pepiliyana.? ?

"A spirited, go-getter by nature, Nihal soon ventured into entrepreneurship and started his own business in Japan and was offered an honorary citizenship in Japan 1975. Nimal met the love of his life, Saeko, in 1978 and got married a few years later. "
Many are the conversations, as well as heated arguments, we have had about subjects ranging from politics to business to music and cultural diversity. He was a walking encyclopedia with a wealth of knowledge that put what we knew about life and other things to shame.? The eve of 2002 general elections was a particularly such vivacious night where about 10 of us including Nimal were having an intense debate about the election outcome. As the row reached a boiling point Nihal stood up, poured everyone their last round of scotch and exclaimed rather loudly ?Time for dinner!?
You buggers are shouting because you all are hungry!? That is one of my fondest memories of this gentle giant who always knew what to say. He used to constantly thank me for keeping him company during the time I took refuge at his place as though I was doing him a favour; In his generosity, he was simply oblivious to the fact that it was he, who was helping me.?
That was Nimal; giving, nurturing and caring was so much a part of his DNA that he didn?t even realize he was changing someone?s life.? Memories of this lovable maverick who indeed a gentleman par excellence will live forever in the hearts of many.? Adios Nimal. This is not goodbye my friend. We will see you on the other side.? ?

Appreciation: The Hindu who build 65 ft Samadhi Buddha Statue
	
?
Devanayagam Eswaran, Chairman of Eswaran Brothers, was a unique human being who had elevated himself to a high level of mindfulness.?Following in the footsteps handed down by Hindu and Buddhist philosophies, he had reached a level of mindfulness where one gives up traits such as greed, lust and jealousy.
While a deeply religious Hindu, he is someone who will be remembered for his great contribution forwards Buddhism.
?After the destruction of the colossal Bahamian Buddha statues in Afghanistan in 2001, there was a pale of gloom over the entire Buddhist world.
This sad news reverberated across the world and in a quaint town of Rambadagalle in the Kurunegala District, many questions were raised among the Buddhists as to what they could do to at least in some small measure to make up for this loss.?
Instead of choosing revenge, the Buddhist clergy in the area suggested that a bigger statue be built to compensate the loss.
It was a mighty task and one which could never have been achieved if not for Devanayagam Eswaran.
A devout Hindu, he had commissioned the building of the statue of Lord Hanuman in Ramboda. Upon hearing of the uphill task undertaken to build a Buddha statue in Rambadagalla, Mr Eswaran enthusiastically extended his assistance by personally inviting Muthu Muthiah Sthapathi ? a world-renowned Indian sculpture to undertake the project.?
Thus started our strong friendship and close association during which Mr Eswaran did all he could to assist in the project.? The 65 feet tall Samadhi Statue of the Buddha in Rambodagalle Viharaya is a reality today and a lasting tribute to Mr Eswaran?s selfless contribution towards Buddhism. It is because of the effort and support by this Hindu friend that this ambitious project became a reality. Our friendship started in 2002 and continued till he passed away in January this year. In the desert of humanity, he was an oasis, someone who brought peace and tranquillity relief to anyone who associated him.? ?

The first stamp for Ceylon was issued on 1 April 1857. The stamp features a portrait of Queen Victoria and is brown in colour. It is a 6 Pence value used to send a half-ounce letter from Ceylon to England
The image illustrates Ceylon?s first postage with all for margins (Below Left). A special feature of this stamp is, it?s printed in a blued paper with a star watermark. The back image of the stamp clearly indicates the blued colour and the star watermark. (Below Right)
Sir Rowland Hill proposed an adhesive stamp to indicate pre-payment of postage. At the time it was normal for the recipient to pay postage on delivery, charged by the sheet and on distance travelled. The first postage stamp was printed in the United Kingdom in 1840. Since Ceylon was a British colony in those days? letters was transmitted in between both countries. As a result, Ceylon first postage stamp was designed in London and printed by Perkins Bacon & Co.
Sir Rowland Hill
According to the statistics 65,000 of the stamp were printed. Printing plates contained 240 impressions in twenty rows of twelve and it?s was imperforated.
Image of the Perkins? press, printing machine is seen far left, is now in the British Library Philatelic Collections.
Postal reforms came to Ceylon in 1856.? An Ordinance published that year established postal rates effective April 1, 1857, at 1d. for ? oz. and an additional 1d. for the next ? oz. with each additional ounce being 2d.? Newspapers and printed matter for domestic destinations was ?d. and for foreign destinations was 1d.? The first pound of a parcel was 8d. with each additional pound at 4d.? Prepayment was to be made by stamps, however, until stamps became available, prepayment could be made in cash.?
The letter (Left, Middle) from Colombo to Trieste, sent in 1857 (26 June) bearing very fine 6d. a purple-brown pair,? was sold in an auction for $21,000.?

China?s aircraft carrier spotted in huge naval drill
	
?
BEIJING AFP March30, 2018- Beijing flexed its military muscle this week as its sole operational aircraft carrier apparently took part in a huge naval drill with dozens of other vessels in the South China Sea, satellite images showed.
The pictures, taken by Planet Labs Inc., appear to show the Liaoning carrier at the centre of a formation of more than 40 other ships lined up in pairs south of China?s Hainan province island on Monday. China?s defence ministry refused to confirm whether the Liaoning took part in drills this week but military experts say the aircraft carrier is identifiable.
Six submarines and two J-15 fighter jets appear to lead the ?naval parade?, James Char, a military expert at Singapore?s Nanyang Technological University, told AFP. ?Such a formation serves more of as a visual spectacle with the Liaoning the status symbol of the PLA (People?s Liberation Army),? Char said. ?This formation is unlikely to be used in actual combat situations,? he said, adding that he would ?not be surprised? if it was purposely aimed at being picked up by satellite images.
The show of force emerged days after Taiwan said that the Liaoning and other vessels had passed through the Taiwan Strait on March 20 -- the same day that Chinese President Xi Jinping warned against any attempts to divide China.
- Sea claims -??
Beijing has also been asserting its vast claims to the South China Sea, transforming reefs into islands capable of hosting military equipment. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Taiwan have their own claims to the sea, while US warships regularly conduct ?freedom of navigation? operations near islands controlled by Beijing.

Chinese space station falls into Pacific Ocean
	
China's defunct Tiangong-1 space lab mostly broke up on re-entering the Earth's atmosphere above the South Pacific, the BBC reported today quoting Chinese and US reports.
It had re-entered the atmosphere around 00:15 GMT on Monday, China's Manned Space Engineering Office said.
Tiangong-1 was launched in 2011 to carry out docking and orbit experiments.
It was part of China's efforts to build a manned space station by 2022, but stopped working in March 2016.
The rather vague "above the South Pacific" is the line from space officials.
US specialists at the Joint Force Space Component Command said they had used orbit analysis technology to confirm Tiangong-1's re-entry.
Astronomer Jonathan McDowell, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, tweeted that it appeared to have come down north-west of Tahiti.
Experts had struggled to predict exactly where the lab would make its re-entry - and China's space agency wrongly suggested it would be off Sao Paulo, Brazil, shortly before the moment came.
The European Space Agency said in advance that Tiangong-1 would probably break up over water.
It stressed that the chances of anyone being hit by debris from the module were "10 million times smaller than the yearly chance of being hit by lightning".
It's not clear how much of the debris reached the Earth's surface intact.

Country-specific UNHRC resolutions have only one goal
	
To punish unfavourable Governments- Russian Ambassador
Russian Ambassador to Sri Lanka Yury B. Materi, in an interview with the Daily mirror, speaks about bilateral relations, Russia?s role in international affairs and the recent controversy surrounding the asbestos. Excerpts:
Why Russia is against country-specific resolutions on human rights?
?We are strongly condemning the use of human rights issues as an excuse for interfering in domestic affairs of countries as well as undermining the basic principles of International Law. We oppose the adoption of the politicized country-specific resolutions, especially taking into account the successful functioning of the Universal Periodic Review mechanism in the UN Human Rights Council.
The adoption of country-specific resolutions has only one goal to punish unfavourable governments. This is utterly counterproductive because the patronizing tone has never contributed to improvements in the human rights situation and labelling countries on the basis of political motives discredit the United Nations agencies.
What is your view on the emerging world order??
A. We are witnessing the emergence of a polycentric system of international relations and the development of a rejuvenated democratic and fair multi-polar world order. New centres of economic growth, financial power and political influence are emerging in the course of objective historical development. The international system should be adjusted to involve these new centres of power in an equal dialogue and to develop constructive and widely acceptable solutions. The process of the development of a polycentric world order takes a long time, and it will be painful for those who are losing their positions for the simple reason that the global economy develops in cycles.? ? ? ? ?
International relations are becoming increasingly more complicated and complex. It is obvious that no one country or even several countries alone can effectively deal with terrorism, cybercrime, drug trafficking, climate change and other major modern threats and challenges. More and more countries seek to pursue a pragmatic foreign policy based on their own national interests. The countries want to be free to choose their socioeconomic development model and their destiny. This is why the polycentric architecture and the multipolar world order are not anyone?s whim but objective reality, which the majority of experts in international affairs accept.
There is a trend whereby new emerging centres of power are assuming responsibility for ensuring security and stability in their regions and in the world arena as a whole. It is impossible to stop this process because by and large multi-polarity reflects the truly existing cultural and civilisational diversity of the modern world and, of course, the desire of nations to determine their destinies themselves.
The key world powers have taken an interest in Sri Lanka?s strategic positioning. How does Russia view it?
As I said, of course, we never interfere in the decision making of any country.? Only the Sri Lankan government can decide with whom they should cooperate. We never give any advice to Sri Lanka how to develop its foreign policy. Some countries were trying to teach your country how to pursue your foreign policy.? It is not the policy of the Russian Federation to give advice on this matter. If it is to the benefit of your country, you are developing relations with some countries depending on the economic potential. That is our attitude.
In the development of bilateral relations between Sri Lanka and Russia, the visit of your President Maithripala Sirisena is the main thing. The decisions taken by the two Presidents are the guidelines for the development of our relations. They agreed upon different issues. We are just trying to implement what was decided by the Presidents in terms of trade, economic cooperation, and others including military-technical cooperation.??
As a follow-up, there was the second meeting of the Inter-Governmental Commission on trade, economic, scientific and technical cooperation which was held in Colombo on 24-26 October 2017.
It is very important to increase the volume of trade.? In our view, it does not correspond to the level of our relations.? It should be much more. We should attract more Russian businessmen to Sri Lanka. We hope Sri Lankan businessmen will be interested in dealing with our companies. The main task set up by the Presidents is to increase trade.
What are the potential areas for expansion of trade?
I can speak only about the Russian side. If you speak about our exports, we can increase the export of machinery and equipment. For example, medical equipment, equipment for electric power stations, chemical products, and other value-added products can be taken.? There is cooperation in the power sector-thermal power generation.
There was the visit of representatives from the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation ?Rosatom?. We discussed the possibility for interaction with Sri Lanka for the peaceful use of atomic energy.? There were a lot of proposals given to Sri Lankan side for considerations by the line ministries and agencies. We are ready to advance this cooperation.? There was a proposal for credit facilities from Russia if there was a big project in this case.? ?There is big cooperation in terms of tourism. A lot of Russians are coming here as tourists for recreation, to spend their vacation on the beautiful beaches of your country.?
?
	Russia-Sri Lanka trade volume does not correspond with the level of bilateral relations?
	
	
	Ambassador speaks about the current status of tea trading between two countries
	
	
	Explains scientific aspect of Russian asbestos
	
	
	Spells out Russian policy on country-specific UNHRC resolutions
	
Recently, there was a crisis in tea trade with Russia over a ban on such imports from Sri Lanka. How is tea trading now?
Actually, the tea issue was resolved within one week. All the parties were interested in solving this issue.? There was a cooperative attitude from the Sri Lankan side. We solved this issue very quickly. Now tea trading takes place as usual. There is no problem.? We hope this will continue. The Sri Lankan side agreed to look into all the quarantine issues.
Yet, there was the public perception here that Russia slapped such a ban because of Sri Lanka?s move to ban the import of roofing asbestos from Russia. What is the reality?
It is absolutely a separate issue. Sri Lanka suspended the ban on the import of Chrysotile asbestos from Russia. Yet, it has not cancelled the ban. There is the possibility of introducing the ban from January 1, 2024. If the two issues were connected, we could not have lifted the ban on tea until the final decision was taken.? But, still, the possibility of banning the import of Chrysotile asbestos remains. It is possible from January 1, 2024.
In this instance, we are only talking about Chrysotile asbestos, not other kinds of asbestos. It is proved by scientists of Sri Lanka and Russian researchers Chrysotile asbestos was not dangerous for human health. When you talk about other kinds of asbestos, it may be dangerous. Chrysotile asbestos is safe.
This asbestos is used in many countries such as the United States, India, China, Pakistan, Canada, Indonesia, Brazil, etc.
Your President Vladimir Putin was re-elected for the fourth time. What is the way forward now?
Our President won the elections. It is a landslide victory. His victory was approved by our Central election commission.? He got 76.69 percent of votes. His nearest competition only got 11.77 percent. It showed that a vast majority of our people supported his internal and external policies.? He received congratulations from many leaders. We also appreciate congratulations sent by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
What are your thoughts on the recent developments surrounding the Salisbury incident?
The actions of the British authorities raise many questions. No information has been provided about the activities of Britain?s secret research facility in Porton Down near Salisbury, where chemical research was conducted. No information has been provided about Operation Toxic Dagger, an annual chemical warfare exercise conducted at the Porton Down facility together with the UK military, which was completed shortly before the Skripals? poisoning.
Meanwhile, London has initiated a worldwide campaign to spread the presumption of Russia?s guilt. We see a deliberate and purposeful escalation of confrontation and a demonstration of military force on Russia?s border. It is an obvious effort to undermine the political and diplomatic interaction to achieve an objective and comprehensive investigation of the Salisbury incident.
The analysis of all these circumstances shows that the UK authorities are not interested in identifying the real causes and the real perpetrators of the crime in Salisbury, which suggests a possible involvement of the UK intelligence services.

Incident at Lingaraja Temple-- Can?t understand why I was refused entry: Minister
	
Minister of Buddha Sasana Gamini Jayawickrama Perera referring to the incident where he was not allowed to enter the Lingaraja Temple in Odisha, said yesterday that he does not understand why this happened to him.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, the minister said he was forced to face this embarrassment during a tour organised by the Kalinga International Foundation at Bhubaneswar on March 16.
Minister Perera explained that the temple authorities had not allowed him to enter the temple stating that he was not a Hindu.
?Lingaraja is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva and is one of the oldest temples in Bhubaneswar, the capital of the East Indian state of Odisha. I wanted to visit the place as a devout Buddhist as the place is also historically important to Buddhists.
?The temple is linked to the time of King Ashoka, the great Indian emperor who spread the Dhamma around the world. Arahath Mahinda, who is depicted in Buddhist sources as being responsible for bringing Buddhism to Sri Lanka was also from Odisha. Therefore, the temple is historically important to Buddhists,? he said.
Minister Perera explained that he was surprised by the incident as hundreds of Lankan devotees including Buddhists visit Hindu temples in Tirupati and Kerala.
Minister Perera said that it was an embarrassing situation as the Sri Lanka High Commissioner to India was also among the delegation that visited the temple with him.
The minister said that when he brought up the embarrassment faced by him at the famous temple in the course of the conference in Bhubaneswar former Indian foreign secretary and the Chairman of the Kalinga International Foundation Lalit Mansingh had apologised for what had taken place and assured that incidents such as this would not occur again.
The Lingaraja temple is maintained by the Temple Trust Board and the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and while the temple compound is not open to non-Hindus there is a viewing platform beside the wall offering a good view of the main exteriors. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Iran slams Israel?s ?shameful? killing of Gaza protesters
	
?
TEHRAN AFP March31, 2018- Iran?s foreign minister on Saturday condemned the fatal shooting of 16 Gazan protesters by Israeli troops and mocked the fact that it happened as Israeli Jews prepared to mark Passover.
The protesters were among thousands who marched along the Gaza-Israel border on Friday and set up protest camps at the start of a six-week campaign for the return of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees who fled or were expelled during the war surrounding Israel?s creation in 1948.
The week-long Passover festival, which began at sundown on Friday, commemorates God?s liberation of the Jewish people from slavery in Egypt as told in the Book of Exodus in the Hebrew Bible.
?On the eve of Passover (of all days), which commemorates God liberating Prophet Moses and his people from tyranny, Zionist tyrants murder peaceful Palestinian protesters -- whose land they have stolen -- as they march to escape their cruel and inhuman apartheid bondage. Shameful,? Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted.
Iran has long been a supporter of Islamist group Hamas which controls the Gaza Strip. Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghassemi condemned the ?savage massacre of a large number of Palestinians by the armed forces of the Zionist regime (Israel)?.

US, S. Korea begin low-key army drills amid diplomatic thaw
	
?
The United States and South Korea kicked off a low-key joint military drill Sunday as a diplomatic thaw over North Korea gathered pace.
Tension on the flashpoint peninsula have showed signs of easing in recent months after the isolated, nuclear-armed North proposed summits with the South and their ?imperialist enemy? the US.
The annual Foal Eagle drill -- a series of field training exercises involving some 11,500 American and 290,000 South Korean troops -- began early Sunday, Seoul?s defense ministry spokesman said.
The drill -- which was delayed to avoid clashing with February?s Winter Olympics in the South -- will be held for a month in April, about half the time it usually lasts.
This year?s drills feature fewer strategic weapons like a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, Seoul army said earlier. The deployment of such powerful weapons at past drills has frequently drawn an angry response from the North.
The two allies are also set to stage the annual Key Resolve drill -- a tabletop exercise using mainly computer-based simulations -- for the usual duration of two weeks beginning late April.
Pyongyang, which habitually slams the joint army drills between the South and the US as a rehearsal for invasion, has remained relatively quiet on the issue in recent weeks.
The Foal Eagle drill started the same day as a historic concert by South Korean pop stars in Pyongyang, which will be staged late Sunday as a peace gesture ahead of this month?s inter-Korea summit.
Eleven South Korean acts -- including popular K-pop girlband Red Velvet -- are set to perform in the North Korean capital -- the first such concert for more than a decade.
The flurry of reconciliatory moves comes after the Pyeongchang Winter Games, which the North used to mount a charm offensive, sending athletes, cheerleaders and even leader Kim Jong Un?s powerful sister as a delegate.

Winnie Mandela: South African anti-apartheid campaigner passes away
	
South African anti-apartheid campaigner Winnie Mandela has died at the age?of?81, BBC News reported this evening quoting her personal assistant.
Winnie Madikizela Mandela was the former wife of South Africa's first black president, Nelson Mandela.
The couple - famously pictured hand-in-hand as Mr Mandela walked free from prison after 27 years - were a symbol of the anti-apartheid struggle for nearly three decades.
However, in later years her reputation became tainted legally and politically.
Family spokesman Victor Dlamini said in a statement: "She died after a long illness, for which she had been in and out of hospital since the start of the year.
"She succumbed peacefully in the early hours of Monday afternoon surrounded by her family and loved ones."
Mrs Mandela was born in 1936 in the Eastern Cape - then known as Transkei.
She was a trained social worker when she met her future husband in the 1950s. They were married for a total of 38 years, although for almost three decades of that time they were separated due to Mr Mandela's imprisonment.
Despite their separation two years after his release, and their divorce in 1996, she kept his surname and maintained ties with him.
