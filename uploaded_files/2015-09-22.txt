Nexus between a court case and a political deal
	
There is a rumour abuzz in political circles these days that moves are afoot to put on the ice a certain court case involving the better half of a prominent opposition politico.
The better half, in fact, had to languish in the hospital of the main state-run lodge for a few days in connection with this case. Both legal and security authorities who were once keen on pursuing this case seem to have lost their interest in it, they say. Some political observers attribute this development to a new political deal in the making. Two Ministerial ones the other day were discussing the present status of the court case in question when one of them quoted the much hackneyed, but ever fresh adage: ?In politics, there are no permanent enemies or permanent friends!?

A rendezvous shrouded in mystery!
	
The former strongman recently enjoyed a long holiday at Pasikuda, a popular national resort on the eastern coastline.
	?
He had checked in to a star-class hotel to take a respite from the train of worries that have been visiting him ever since being ousted from office. ?They say he had his fun in full measure by swimming in calm and shallow waters, jet sking in the surf and even diving in deep waters to watch the corrals. One evening when the afterglow was painting the distant skies in rose and golden hues and the former strongman was taking a stroll along the beach when he espied a familiar figure walking towards him. The other beach walker presently turned out to be none other than the Green party leader, the second in command of the ?yahapalanaya? regime!
There were some people who witnessed the two political rivals warmly greeting each other and engaging in what seemed to be a friendly conversation. But what they had talked about remains a mystery, they say. Many also still wonder whether the duo met on the beach by sheer accident or by design.

Buddhist prelate?s advice disdained!
	
This highly respected Buddhist prelate, the founder-leader of movement committed to bringing about a just society threw his full weight behind the campaign to usher in the yahapalanaya government.?
Though he has articulated his disapproval of certain measures taken by the government, he has not given up his effort to put it back on the correct path.?
The prelate now in poor health had recently given some guidelines to be followed in the formation of the new Cabinet along with a list of names of 17 white collar veterans known for their integrity to be considered for appointment as Ministry secretaries.?
The secretaries to all Ministries were appointed last week, but none of the white collar veterans recommended by the prelate was among them, they say.?

Premier details reconciliation measures
	
The government will soon set up several commissions including a South African-style parliamentary truth commission, a compassionate commission and a permanent office to look into disappearances, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe told parliament today.
Making a special statement in Parliament, he said advice will be sought from South Africa to set up the truth commission but it would not be a carbon copy of what South Africa itself set up in that country.
The Prime Minister said the compassionate commission will comprise leaders of all religions and would be under the purview parliament.
He said permanent office to look into disappearances would be within the precincts of parliament and would be mandated to provide information on the missing and provide compensation to the families of those gone missing.
"For this the government will obtain the advice of the International Red Cross," the Prime Minister said and added that special courts would be set up to provide redress to mete out justice to those who have been affected by the armed conflict.
"These measures are being adopted by the national government not with the intention of satisfying the international community but in an effort to bring about much needed reconciliation and to avoid such conflicts and misunderstandings in the future" he said.
The Prime Minister assured parliament that none of these mechanisms would contain parts brought down from abroad," he said.
He underlined the fact that the reason for the international community to develop a negative attitude towards Sri Lanka because nothing was being done to bring about peace and reconciliation after the armed conflict ended in 2009 in line with the assurance given to UN Secretary General who visited Sri Lanka that year.

Meanwhile, Minister Samaraweera during his address noted that Sri Lanka is currently laying the groundwork for a new Constitution including a new electoral system based on what is popularly known domestically as the ?German Model?, in the aim of resolving longstanding grievances of the minorities and to embark on economic reforms that would result in a social market economy.
The Minister furthermore stated that Sri Lanka hopes to prioritize closer economic cooperation with German, pointing out it is Sri Lanka?s fifth largest export market that accounts for nearly 5% of the exports. He also encouraged and welcomed other German firms including those from Mittelstand to benefit from Sri Lanka?s skilled labour-force, improving governance and easily accessible emerging markets along the Indian Ocean rim including India and Pakistan.(Lakna Paranamanna)

? ?TTG Incontri in Italy - The cultural focus country - Sri Lanka
ATM in Dubai took the Sri Lankan Wildlife theme, ITB in Berlin took the theme Sri Lankan Beaches, KOTFA took the proposition 'Sri Lankan Festivals' and Moscow Travel Fair was themed 'Sri Lankan Tea and the Guinness Book of records attempt' which are all coming under the positioning " Sri Lanka - an island of thousand treasures" said Chairman Athukorala.?
Next week Sri Lankan Tourism will theme the next wave of global trade fairs in line with the aspirations of the targeted traveller he said. Starting from JATA in Japan where the theme will be " Worlds oldest fetival- ?Esela Perahera", the key Scandinavian fair will take the proposition " Sri Lanka the sapphire capital of the world" whilst the famous Italian TTG fair will be taking the proposition " The cultural focus country - Sri Lanka" said the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotions Bureau in a communique .
Sri Lanka taking the Cultural Focus Country of TTG Incontri 2015, the key Italian exhibition and in the top five in Europe for the tourist trade, will be staged at Rimini Fiera Italy.

The number of tourists visiting the country is increasing given that as at end August 2015 the numbers record a 17.1% crossing the 1.1 million number which proves that the destinations and services offered are increasingly popular. This success is due to the country?s peace and beauty: Sri Lanka is often described as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean. The facilities offered range from immense beaches to parks, but attention is focussed above all on the country?s historical and cultural wonders said the Conference organizers it's weekly press release. ?
For nature lovers, particularly fans of water sports such as windsurf, Sri Lanka is also an increasingly popular destination, as it is for those looking for great emotions, in contact with the wilder parts pf the country, which also has the world?s highest concentration of leopards. Numerous initiatives are also offered by the ministry of tourism and the possibilities of accommodation are increasingly suited to western and international tourists? requirements. Not to mention the spiritual dimension and the possibility Sri Lanka offers for discovering oneself Saudi the release.
From 8th to 10th October 2015 Rimini Fiera will also host the 52nd TTG Incontri, 64thSIA GUEST major International Hospitality exhibition and 33rd SUN , the key International Exhibition for the Outdoor world.

Navy spokesman Indika De Silva said Mr. Wijeweera's family had been living in Trincomalee and Welisara Naval Quarters from time to time since July, 11, 1992.
Commander De Silva said as per the decision the family would be allowed to stay till March 31 next year.
