President promises a host of benefits for workers
	
President Maithripala Sirisena, speaking at the Sri Lanka Freedom Partys (SLFP's) May Day rally in Galle yesterday, vowed that five major changes to the working conditions of the workers -- increasing of pensionable age to 60, full maternity leave for all private sector female employees, making the minimum private sector salary Rs. 13,500, ensuring that all public service employees get a Rs.10,000 pay increase and creating a pension scheme for the private sector -- would be implemented this year.
He also said the European Union (EU) would ratify the lifting of the fish ban on Sri Lanka tonight, and the country would regain the GSP plus trade facility with improved access to markets in the European Union, within the new few weeks.
Addressing a massive May Day rally at the Samanala Grounds in Galle town, President Sirisena said the 8th goal of the Sustainable Development Report 2016 of the UN was the acceptance of the rights and privileges of the working class -- and Sri Lanka was fully committed to protect and further improve the rights of the working class.
The objective of the UN is that the labour should be given acceptance and respect. It must not be held in high regards and it must not be obtained unfairly. Labour and wages had been given a different meaning. They were looked at from a different perspective in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, but to day wages and labour are treated in a very respectful and accepted manner. Today they cannot be mistreated or exploited unfairly, he said.
President Sirisena said not only those who work on the road or in a factory but all those who sweat in offices, warehouses, garment factories, IT labs and other places are treated as labourers and therefore they must all be given respect and all the rights they deserve. The SLFP had respected the working class and their labour from the time of its establishment some 60 years ago by S.W.R.D.Bandaranaike. The recognition of labour rights was a major principle of the pary.
Violation of labour rights and human rights was a major blackmark against Sri Lanka in the eyes of the international community in the recent past. As a result Sri Lanka was treated as a pariah state and we were slapped with a fish export ban and the GSP plus facility was withdrawn by the EU. As a result the country sustained a huge economic downturn. But today Sri Lanka is on a path of speedier progress, and the global community has accepted Sri Lanka as an equal partner of democracy., he said.
He said Sri Lanka had been invited to the G7 summit in Japan which would be attended by the heads of state of the US, Germany, the UK, Italy, Canada, France and Japan. The invitation was a symbol of the respect and acceptance Sri Lanka had earned since this government came to power. Our motherland was destined achieve an accelerated development and improve the living standards of the people in the years to come with the assistance of the top world leaders.
He said he would leave for Japan on May 25th to participate in the G7 summit.
Commenting on the demand for federalism since 4the 40s and 50s, President Sirisena said we must look at the reasons for this demand, rather that criticising it, and try to remove the reasons.
President Sirisena said all SLFPers must work hard to form an SLFP government at a future election and to do that the party needed true, clean, honest and dedicated supporters and politicians who could take the party to victory. Therefore, he said, it was vital to maintain discipline, honesty and dignity among all SLFPers.
President Sirisena said the SLFPers must look at leaders like Abraham Lincoln, Carl Marx, Lenin, Trotsky, Mahatma Gandhi and SWRD Bandaranaike when they rebuild the party and attempt to bring victory to the party and form a government or their own. (Sandun A Jayasekera reporting from Galle)

Reconsider MR's security withdrawal: Joint Opp.
	
While denouncing the Governments move to assign Police personnel for former President Mahinda Rajapaksas security detail, the Joint Opposition requested both the President and the Prime Minister, to call off the move.
Joint Opposition Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena said unlike other past leaders Rajapaksa should be entitled to VVIP security, since it was he who defeated the LTTE.
The remaining LTTE elements are waiting for an opportunity to harm Mr. Rajapaksa. Now, that the highly trained security personnel are no longer with him, his life is in danger. We have already requested the President, and the Premier in writing in this regard. Unfair avenging should come to an end, he told a news conference today.
Meanwhile, MP Prasanna Ranatunga requested the Government to reconsider the decision due to current security situation in the country.
Former President needs skilled personnel to protect him from LTTE elements. Defence Ministry Secretary said there had been 300 incidents of recovery of explosives and other such incidents in the North and East so far. Northern Province calls for federalism, while Tamil Nadu calls for Eelam in here. Therefore, we request that the decision be reconsidered, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The Tamil National Alliance (TNA), in a May Day resolution, requested the government not to increase the Value Added Tax (VAT) on food items consumed by the general public and education services.
The government, in its proposed tax reforms, has decided to rescind the VAT exemptions on private health services, education and the telecommunications.
TNA Jaffna District MP, M. A. Sumanthiran told Daily Mirror that his party would adopt a resolution calling on the government not to impose taxes on the education sector and essential food items. Besides this, he said, there would be two other resolutions calling for the development of the war affected areas and a political solution based on power sharing among the communities in the country.

What is happening now is what I said earlier: Attanayake
	
Former General Secretary of the UNP Tissa Attanayake said what is now happening in the North is what he had said earlier and which were not accepted by some.
Speaking to media personnel on last Saturday morning after visiting the newly appointed chief prelate of the Asgiriya chapter the Most Venerable Sastrapathi Warakagoda Gnanarathana Thera, and obtaining his blessings, he said that the Northern Provincial Council had made certain proposals and after adopting them had sought international assistance, which had been flatly declined by the foreign delegates.
He also said that he worked with the UNP for thirty years, and hope to launch his party soon.
Some of the things that are taking place now, I had foreseen but they were not accepted and I was taken into custody for no fault of mine and was subjected to harassment, which I endured ungrudgingly. I can now state emphatically that what Ive stated is comparatively similar to what is happening now, he said further.
He stated people of our country had much hopes when they brought this government into power, but now they are faced with certain issues, even the workers too are now confronted with issues, Attanayake said.
When asked about his future plans, Attanayake stated that he has his own political party and that he had not attempted to spread it islandwide and he would do so at the correct time. (J.A.L. Jayasinghe)

Mustapha: LG polls not this year
	
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizser Mustapha today ruled out the possibility of elections for local authorities this year, because of work involved in delimitation.
The Minister said the committee, assigned for sorting out anomalies in delimitation of electoral wards, would be given an extra month to finish the task.
The time limit granted for this purpose will be extended up to September. Earlier, it was to end on August 31, he said.
We have to conduct the election under the ward system in fairness to all the communities. It is my responsibility as the subject minister to take steps in this direction. Earlier, it had been done at the discretion of the political authority, without consulting people and civil society leaders. The UPFA Secretary wants me to conduct the elections as soon as possible. I cannot act according his dictates. As the Minister, I am responsible for the whole country and its people but not for the UPFA as a party, he said.
The Minister said some parties and organisations were pushing him for early Local Government elections.
I would like to ask how these parties sort out anomalies in the creation of electoral wards, he said.
