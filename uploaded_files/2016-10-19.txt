Cricketers refuse to sign contract ahead of Zimbabwe tour
	
Sri Lanka?s National cricketers and their Board are squaring off for a stand-off over a fresh contract, with the players firmly rejecting to sign the new performance-based agreements on offer.
The new contract sees a substantial cut in players? annual contract fees although they have been offered significant win bonuses and individual performance bonuses.
But the players have registered their firm disapproval, demanding a ten percent increase in their contract fees instead.
The dispute comes just days ahead of the team?s departure to Zimbabwe for a two-match Test series followed by a Tri-Series also involving the West Indies.
Skipper Angelo Mathews, his Deputy Dinesh Chandimal and veteran spinner Rangana Herath who are in the top category failed to reach a compromise when they met the Board?s CEO Ashley de Silva yesterday. They will meet board officials again this morning in the hope of avoiding a full blown crisis.
SLC?s decision to introduce pay-cuts was largely motivated by finding the Board had disbursed Rs. 684.85 million - approximately around 33 percent of Board?s income - among the 16 players in the National Squad during the previous contract year.
A player in the top category received a contract fee of US $165,000; in category 2, US $100,000; US $70,000 in category 3; and US $40,000 in category 4 during the 2015-2016 contract period which ended in February in addition to match fees, 10 percent share from the ICC and ACC events and a percentage from team sponsorship.
But SLC?s new administrators decided to reduce this substantially where a player in the top category will now receive a reduced annual contract fee of US$ 125,000 as opposed to the US$ 165,000 received last year.
A player in category 2 will receive US $ 80,000 while the contract fee for category 3 has been set at US $ 60,000. A category 4 player will receive an annual fee of US $ 40,000 and US $ 20,000 per player in category 5.
Accordingly, the Test match fee has been brought down to US $ 5000 from US $ 7500.This amount will be increased to US $ 10,000, if they win.
Also, every century scored or five or more wickets taken in a Test match will earn a player an additional US $ 5000.
The ODI and T20 match fees remain the same at US $ 3000 and US $ 2000 respectively. However, in order to create competitiveness and encourage individual performance, the Board is offering US $ 5000 for every century scored in a limited-over match and a five-wicket haul taken.
In T20?s, this has been increased by further US $ 2500, meaning a century or a five wicket-haul will fetch them US $ 7500.
In 2014 players and Board engaged in a major contract stand-off after SLC refused a share of ICC and ACC events. (Champika Fernando)

Two JO members from the Gem-city are out to lock horns with John the Silent from the same district.?
?
John the Silent widely considered a gentleman-politician has been a consistent advocate of party unity and some Blues were surprised when they learnt that the two JO stalwarts are out for John?s blood.
However, informed sources say that the antipathy towards John the Silent has resulted from the rivalry over the party?s district leadership.
The JO politicos who organized the Gem-city rally had set the stage for the former strongman to direct a barb or two at John during his speech. In fact, a group of party supporters had positioned themselves immediately opposite the stage as pre-planned and shouted: ?Say something about John,? when the former strongman was addressing the rally. However, the former strongman, a seasoned politician with a keen political scent had disappointed the organizers by telling the vociferous group: ?Don?t say anything against him. He is due to sit with us in the near future??
The former strongman?s announcement about John the Silent drew several rounds of applause from the crowd while making a few on the stage look sheepish.

Is he poised for his next somersault?
	
?
A certain politico who is said to have called at Temple Trees carrying all his personal effects tuck in a ?sili-sili? bag at the time the former strongman was busy forming a government, has become a multi-billionaire today.
?
This was revealed while the past history and the origin of the political career of this politico hailing from the Puttalam area came up as a topic at a discussion held at a high-end hotel in the city quite recently. The participants at the discussion were several onetime whitecollar high-ups who functioned as top aides to the former strongman.
The politico who had mastered the tricks of the trade made a political somersault on time to become a top team member in yahapalanaya as well. However, being compelled to make regular visits to the FCID, the purohita is a disillusioned man these days, they say
. The politico has now held out the threat to quit the government along with his four or five party members if the law hounds were not pulled off his neck. Meanwhile, he had also informed the former strongman of his decision to cross the floor.
Perhaps the former strongman may have had in his mind the latest posturing of the turncoat politico when he declared at the JO-organized public rally in Ratnapura that a change in the head count in the council could send the present government packing home adding such an eventuality was not far from being a reality, they say.

LankaClear becomes first in South Asia to launch online transfer mode for CITS
	
LankaClear (Pvt.) Ltd, the operator of Sri Lanka?s national payment network ? LankaPay, made yet another gigantic stride in the payment and settlement arena by completely automating the cheque clearing cycle by introducing the online transfer mode of the Cheque Imaging and Truncation System (CITS).?
With this revolutionary initiative, Sri Lanka made history by becoming the first in South Asia to launch the online transfer mode of CITS, which replaced the current inefficient practice of transferring the last mile of cheque images via CD-ROMs.?
This significant achievement is anticipated to further bring down human intervention and inefficiencies associated with the current cheque clearing process to a bare minimum, thus, allow the banks to further extend their service levels to their customers.
Operating under the supervision and guidance of the Central Bank, LankaClear launched the Cheque Imaging and Truncation System (CITS) in 2006, which transformed the domestic interbank cheque clearing process by eliminating the cumbersome physical presentation of the cheque, which saved a significant amount of time and brought down the processing costs substantially.?
Although the introduction of CITS eliminated the inefficiencies associated with physical presentation of cheques, the banks still had to submit the MICR data of physical cheques saved onto CD-ROMs and deliver to LankaClear, daily.?
This process was found to be ineffective due to numerous practical issues encountered in delivering the CD-ROMs before the assigned cut off times and security vulnerabilities due to possibilities of the CD ROMs being damaged while transportation.
With the launch of the online transfer mode of CITS, banks are now able to transmit the MICR data of physical cheques via direct online transfer mode to LankaClear through a secured Virtual Private Network (VPN) with end to end encryption.?
This will be comparatively cost effective to the banks and will also eliminate the hassle of having to deliver the MICR data physically to LankaClear. The new system went live on October 18, 2016 with the participation of several member banks, namely Hatton National Bank, Commercial Bank, Cargills Bank, Standard Chartered Bank and NDB and subsequently the other banks would join the online mode.?
The end objective of introducing CITS online mode is to offer greater flexibility to banks? customers, reduce the clearing cycle and further enhance the security aspects of cheque clearing.
Speaking of the launch of CITS online, LankaClear (Pvt.) Ltd Chairman Anil Amarasuriya said, ?It gives me great pleasure to announce the launch of online transfer mode of CITS, which is in testament to Lanka Clear?s progressive journey towards empowering the nation with efficient, cost-effective, inclusive and secure payment infrastructure, leading the way as the country?s national payment network.?
Speaking on this momentous occasion LankaClear General Manager/CEO Channa de Silva stated, ?LankaClear has been continuously revolutionizing the payments and settlements landscape in Sri Lanka by introducing many technology innovations and this is only another milestone in our long journey, even though it is an extremely significant achievement for the country. By this initiative, we came one more step closer to help banks to increase their efficiencies and enhance customer experience.?

Three Navy Ratings had been admitted to the Mannar Hospital following an ambush by the villagers of Arippu on Tuesday night, the Silawathurai Police said.
The Police said that on receiving a tip off by the Silawathurai Navy Camp in Mannar, that Kerala Ganja is being smuggled to the Arippu area by sea, a team of Navy intelligence officers had gone to check on the information.
However, the residents, who had arrived in a group had caught three Naval Ratings and assaulted them, thinking that the Navy men were thieves.
?Later a crowd numbering more than 300 had taken them to the Arippu Navy Camp. After reaching the camp the crowd had shouted that they caught the Navy men while attempting to commit robbery,? a Police officer said.
The Police said in order to quell the situation the Navy personnel at the camp had to shoot into the air.
Seizing this opportunity two of the captured Navy men had escaped and got them warded at the hospital.
However, the remaining Rating was taken to the Catholic Church in Arippu by the residents.
The crowd had refused to release this Naval Rating and yesterday morning a team of senior Police officers together with local political leaders had visited the Church and after a negotiation with the residents, released the Rating on the undertaking that no legal action would be instituted against villagers.

NDB Wealth introduces Kid?s Saver plans
	
As part of children?s financial planning, NDB Wealth has introduced two types of plans, Kid?s Saver, an ideal alternative to a traditional children?s savings account, and Kid?s Saver Plus, a truly unique investment account linked to the performance of the stock market.
According to Christina Wesley, a financial planner with NDB Wealth, ?Putting your money away in a regular savings account that offers insignificant interest rates and flashy toys, isn?t going to make your child a whole lot wealthier.??
Kid?s Saver from NDB Wealth is different from anything else out there since it is designed to give your child all the benefits of a hardworking savings account, but with even more returns. ?The Kid?s Saver plan credits income daily and we all know how powerful compounding or income-on-income can be in the long term,? added Wesley.
If you are an ambitious parent who is looking to get the best out of your investment for your child, be it to prepare for their education, to buy them house or even to save for their marriage, you have to make sure the wealth you need to build keeps up with your ambitions. ?This requires a good plan, the best advisor and the right product,? said Wesley.?
The children?s investment plan, Kid?s Saver Plus from NDB Wealth, is a unique product as it invests a small portion of your savings in the stock market. ?This is a nice booster as your child continues to enjoy the interest income and safety of a savings account, but with only a slightly higher risk taken by investing in the stock market, which will let you achieve your more ambitious financial goals for your child.?
Among the other benefits, both the Kid?s Saver and Kid?s Saver Plus plans allow you or your child to check the account online and watch the balances grow daily; a personalised card is issued for every child and you are offered doorstep service. Also important, as an NDB Wealth client, you have access to invaluable advise from the company?s highly trained relationship managers, part of its exemplary wealth management team recognised for their expertise and excellence in asset and wealth management by the prestigious the Global Banking & Finance Review magazine in 2015.
Commenting, NDB Wealth CEO Prabodha Samarasekera said, ?We are thrilled to share alternatives to traditional children?s savings accounts and investment plans, Kid?s Saver and Kid?s Saver Plus, respectively, which we are confident are better than what is currently available elsewhere in the market today. Added to this is the advice offered by our exemplary financial planners, which is the difference between just scoring and scoring big. As a parent myself, I think it is our responsibility to maximise the opportunities available to our children and NDB Wealth can undoubtedly help you do it.?

Responding to a barrage of questions from the media at the weekly Cabinet news briefing over the controversial remarks made by President Sirisena today that led to a major debate in the media, among the political parties in the Government and the Opposition and among the public, Minister Senaratne said the speech had been wrongly interpreted by the media, including the State media and added that President Sirisena had been misquoted and the media had removed certain parts of the speech and the end result was a totally distorted speech.
Minister Senaratne, apparently on the direct instructions of President Sirisena, told reporters that a number of important points raised by President at the speech had not been given ample exposure by the media.
?What he exactly said was that this Government will not explode as expected by the Joint Opposition but the JO that attempts to make it happen would itself explode before long.

Rupee falls on importer dollar demand
	
REUTERS: The Sri Lankan rupee fell yesterday on importer dollar demand in the absence of central bank intervention, said dealers.
Rupee forwards were active, with the spot-next at 147.20/30 per dollar as of 0752 GMT, compared with its previous close of 147.00/05.
The spot rupee was quoted at 146.90/95 per dollar, but hardly traded. It was steady last week after two weeks of losses.
The spot rupee is usually managed by the Central Bank, and market participants use the forward market levels for guidance on the currency.
?There was importer (dollar) demand and traders were reluctant to trade spot below 146.90 because the central bank (last week) prevented its trading below this level. But the central bank was not seen today,? said a currency dealer, asking not to be named.
The Central Bank has been buying dollars from the market to accumulate reserves to meet targets set by the International Monetary Fund under a US $1.5-billion loan deal, dealers said.
Officials at the Central Bank were not available for comments.
Dealers said they expected the rupee to remain under pressure due to seasonal imports.

SLI ?Minimuthu Dayada? competition winners tour Singapore
	
The 10 lucky children who were selected through a raffle draw from the ?Minimuthu Dayada Sihina Ekathuwa? competition earlier this year got the opportunity recently to travel to Singapore with a parent, courtesy Sri Lanka Insurance (SLI).
The competition, which required children to put their future ambition on canvas with crayons, water colours or any medium of their choice, had attracted over 5,000 entries from across the island.?
The competition had been organised by SLI to coincide with the launch of ?Minimuthu Dayada Children?s Plan?, an insurance policy especially designed to facilitate the nation?s children to achieve their future goals. Some of the special features of the policy are: maturity benefit of 125 percent of the sum assured, flexibility to decide the sum assured based on affordability, commencement of annuity payments upon the child reaching 18 years of age, bonus payments, daily cash benefits in the event of hospitalisation and waiving off of future premiums upon the parent?s death.
The lucky winners of the Singapore tour were W.A. Hiruka Vinol from Kesbewa, K. Dinithi Shanela from Negombo, R.A. Adeesha Dulshan from Hanwella, W. Pawindi Bhagya from Badalgama, I.D. Dilshi Pradeepa from Puttalam, Mahima Denuwan from Andiyagala, F. Ramla Riyas from Negombo, Isuru Raveesha from Moratuwa, R. Kunthavi from Kilinochchi and Bawendi Reheshani from Uluwitake. The group consisted of 26 people.
The highlight of the tour, conducted from October 1-4, was the visit to the Universal Studios amusement park. It was a thrilling experience especially for the children. Some of the other top attractions they enjoyed were Merlion Park, Malay Heritage Centre and the Singapore City tour. The tour was appreciated and enjoyed by all the participants, some of who had travelled abroad for the first time.?
R.A. Adeesha Dulshan (10) said he saw and learnt a lot of new things on the tour. ?Everything was great, but I especially enjoyed the visit to Universal Studios. The sections on dinosaurs and ancient Egypt were fantastic. The Sri Lanka Insurance representative explained everything to us so it was very informative and useful. I also managed to form new friendships as there were many other families from different parts of the country in our group,? he said.?
I.D. Rohana Pradeep, eight-year-old Dilshi Pradeepa?s father, had this to say about the tour: ?This was a first time experience for all my family members and we enjoyed it thoroughly. The Universal Studios visit was the most enjoyed by the children while the adults found it equally exciting. ?I can?t pinpoint anything that was amiss in the tour, which was very well organised. We are very happy about the opportunity provided to us by Sri Lanka Insurance.?
Describing her experience, F. Ramla Riyas (8) said, ?I loved every minute of the tour especially ?Ride The Movies? at Universal Studios. We had a lot of fun at the hotel swimming pool too and all the children enjoyed themselves. I told my friends about it and they were also fascinated.??
All in all, it proved to be a dream tour for all 26 participants, one they will talk about for years to come.
