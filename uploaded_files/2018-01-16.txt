Amnesty demands release of Palestinian teen held for assault
	
?
15th JANUARY, 2018- Amnesty International on Monday demanded the release of a 16-year-old Palestinian girl who was detained by Israeli authorities after a video of her slapping and hitting Israeli soldiers went viral on social media.
The Ofer military court will decide later on Monday whether to release Tamimi on bail or keep her in jail for the remainder of her trial. The teen faces 12 criminal charges including assault and incitement.
?Nothing that Ahed Tamimi has done can justify the continuing detention of a 16-year-old girl,? Magdalena Mughrabi of Amnesty International said in a statement.
The trial ?exposes the Israeli authorities? discriminatory treatment of Palestinian children who dare to stand up to ongoing, often brutal, repression by occupying forces,? Mugrabi added. Over 300 Palestinian minors are being held in Israeli prisons. Tamimi has become a symbol of Palestinian resistance to Israeli occupation.

Attempts to alter PCoI report before debate: NFF claims
	
Attempts were made before the parliamentary debate to change the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) report in a way that it would not convey the real essence of the report, National Freedom Front (NFF) MP Jayantha Samaraweera claimed today.
He told a news conference that according to confidential sources an attempt had been made to alter the bond report in a manner that would prove the innocence of the culprits including former finance minister Ravi Karunanayake, former CBSL governor Arjuna Mahendran and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
?It is apparent that the government is deliberately delaying and preventing the bond report from being debated in parliament. Some day the government will have to reveal the truth to the people,? the MP said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Colombo University Law Students raise the bar
	
South Asia moot court competition
At a time when the world is steeped in vicious cycles of violence, complex armed conflicts span borders and numerous atrocities are being inflicted on humanity, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) continues to raise awareness among law students on themes of international humanitarian law (IHL). Conducting annual moot contests has been the ICRC?s platform to spread the word about the knowledge and the application of IHL. This has helped bring to life lessons learnt in lecture halls.??
Mooting involves the oral presentation of a legal argument or problem that is contentious, against an opposing counsel in the presence of a panel of judges. The annual competitions have provided an excellent opportunity for undergraduate students to engage in the field of IHL by moving outside the theoretical understanding that they gain at lectures and immersing themselves practically in the subject. It also allows the students to improve and develop writing and research skills; to become confident in public speaking and oral advocacy as well as to gain practice in developing critical thinking and defending arguments.? ?
?
Each team had to argue for the prosecution and the defence against two different teams. The Sri Lankan team went up against the Indian teams from Nirma University and Gujarat National Law University
Sri Lankan National Rounds
The Sri Lankan national rounds of the 17th Henry Dunant Memorial Moot Court Competition, organized by the ICRC, took place on July 27 and 28, 2017 in Colombo at the College House, University of Colombo.??
The number of teams that competed in this first round suggested how far this initiative had come. The 2017 competition attracted the largest number of participants to date, consisting of nine teams of undergraduate law students competing against each other.? ?
The team from the Faculty of Law, University of Colombo, emerged overall champions and comprised of Sindhu Ratnarajan, Tavini Nanayakkara and Thahira Cader. The team was coached by Sajith Bandara.? ?
Tavini Nanayakkara was named best advocate and the team from the Faculty of Law also received the award for the Best Memorial, which is a written submission containing arguments for the Prosecution and the Defence.? ?
Tavini Nanayakkara speaking on her team?s success said that ?this was a day that we would never forget in our ICRC Journey. It was not the win in itself but the 3-week intense mooting boot camp that made it memorable. Although all three of us had mooted in the past, we had not dealt with the area of International Humanitarian Law before.
South Asia Rounds?
The Colombo Law Faculty team then headed for the next stage of the competition, which was to be held in Kathmandu, Nepal from November 30 to? December 2, 2017. In preparation, the team began brainstorming in new arguments for the regional rounds.? ??
The competition was held at the Radisson Hotel, Kathmandu and began with a briefing session for the participants, which was followed by a reception in which the teams were able to meet each other and engage in fellowship.??
The preliminary rounds were held on December 1, and the Sri Lankan team went up against a team from Nepal in the morning where they argued for the prosecution. That afternoon, the Sri Lankan team went up against a team from Iran, where they argued for the defence. The results were announced in the evening, and the Sri Lankan team, along with the team from Iran and the two teams from India, qualified for the semi finals.??
The semi finals were held in the morning of December 2. Each team had to argue for the prosecution and the defence against two different teams. The Sri Lankan team went up against the Indian teams from Nirma University and Gujarat National Law University.??
After an intense morning of mooting, the team from Nirma University, India and the team from the Faculty of Law, University of Colombo, advanced to the Finals.??
The finals began on December 2? afternoon and the Sri Lankan team argued for the prosecution in the first round and the defence in the second round.? ?
At the awards ceremony which followed, the team from Sri Lanka was adjudged runners up amidst much enthusiastic applause from the crowds. They qualified to participate in the Asia Pacific Rounds to be held in Hong Kong in March 2018.? ?

Thahira Cader speaking on the team advancing to Hong Kong, said that ?it is very exciting to have qualified for the next stage of the competition. We understand that the Asia Pacific Rounds will be challenging but we feel like we have come a long way since July 2017 and are willing to take up the mantle. While the experience of mooting and learning IHL in itself was eye-opening, this competition has also been about the bonds of friendship we forged as a team. In a short space of time we?ve become family.???
The team is currently preparing for the final stage of the competition which is to be held in Hong Kong from the March 7 -10, 2018.??
Finally, the team would like to say ?a big thank you to all those who helped us and supported us to get to this stage of the competition ? to our lecturers, mentors, family and friends. Most importantly to our coach, Sajith Bandara, to whom we are deeply indebted. Thank you for being our pillar of strength and for giving more than we ever asked for. For having our back, every step of the way. We would not have done it without you!???

Disabled school bus driver arrested
	
Police yesterday arrested a 54-year-old school bus driver whose right hand was disabled below the elbow and had a defective ear due to a birth defect. The man who was arrested at Horana had not possessed a driving licence too though there had been 30 children on the bus at the time of his arrest.
On a tip -off received about this disabled driver who was driving the vehicle with the children, he had been arrested close to Sri Pali college in Horana by a team of police officers under the direction of Horana Traffic Police OIC Wimal Ananda. When questioned from the suspect about his driving, he had said that his father had previously driven the school vehicle and after his father?s death, he had been doing this task without any violation of road rules.
The OIC said parents and those who obtain the services of school transport should be careful about those who drive the vehicles.
Police said they would prosecute the driver and the owner of the bus concerned in this regard.

Double suicide bombing in Baghdad kills at least 38 people

HINDUSTAN TIMES, 15th JANUARY, 2018- Two suicide bombers blew themselves up at a busy street market in central Baghdad on Monday, in back-to-back explosions that killed at least 38 people, Iraqi health and police officials said.
The attackers struck during rush hour in the city?s Tayran Square, which is usually crowded by labourers seeking work. The twin explosions also wounded at least 105 people, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to talk to the media.
Earlier reports by spokesmen from the Health Ministry and the Interior Ministry had 26 killed and at least 16 dead, respectively, and dozens wounded.
Ambulances rushed to the scene as security forces sealed off the area with yellow tape. Slippers could be seen scattered about on the blood-stained pavement as cleaners hurried to clear the debris.?

Fitch rates Sampath Bank?s Basel III sub debt ?A (lka)(EXP)?
	
Fitch Ratings has assigned Sampath Bank PLC?s (A+(lka)/Negative) proposed Basel III compliant subordinated debentures an expected National Long-Term Rating of ?A(lka)(EXP)?.??
The notes will total Rs.7.5 billion, mature in five years and carry fixed coupons. The notes include a non-viability clause and will qualify as regulatory Tier II capital for the bank.?
The bank plans to use the proceeds to strengthen its Tier II capital base and support its loan book expansion. The debentures are to be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange.??
The final rating is subject to the receipt of final documentation conforming to information already received.??
Fitch rates the proposed Tier II instrument one notch below the bank?s National Long-Term Rating of ?A+(lka)? to reflect the notes? subordinated status and higher loss-severity risks relative to senior unsecured instruments.?
The notes would convert to equity upon the occurrence of a trigger event, as determined by the Monetary Board of Sri Lanka.??
Sampath?s National Long-Term Rating is used as the anchor rating because the rating reflects the bank?s standalone financial strength. Fitch believes that the bank?s standalone credit profile best indicates the risk of becoming non-viable.? ?
Fitch has not applied additional notching to the notes for non-performance risk, as they have no going-concern loss-absorption features, in line with Fitch?s criteria.? ?
Sampath?s National Long-Term Rating was affirmed on 21 December 2017, factoring in Fitch?s expectation that the bank is in the process of shoring up capitalisation to meet the tighter requirements of 10.0 percent Tier 1 and 14.0 percent total capital ratios by 1 January 2019.?
The bank?s regulatory Tier 1 and total capital ratios were 8.5 percent and 11.9 percent, respectively, at end-September 2017.? ?
In December 2017, Sampath raised Rs.7.6 billion and Rs.6 billion via a rights issue and Basel III compliant subordinated debenture issuance, respectively. In addition to the proposed subordinated debenture issuance of up to Rs.7.5 billion, the bank has announced a further Rs.12.5 billion rights issue for 2018 as part of its medium-term capital plan.??
However, the negative outlook reflects Fitch?s view that Sampath could find it challenging to improve its capitalisation if it fails to successfully execute its medium-term capital plan while maintaining high loan growth of over 20.0 percent, which we expect for 2018 to 2020. Sampath?s gross loan growth of 18.2 percent in 9M17 continues to outpace the industry?s 11.9 percent growth (Sampath 2016: 22.1 percent, industry 2016: 17.5 percent) and Fitch expects this trend to continue alongside the bank?s pursuit of market share.

Floor at Indonesia?s stock exchange collapses, 75 injured
	
AFP: At least 75 people were injured yesterday when a mezzanine floor at Indonesia?s stock exchange building collapsed into the lobby, police said, with victims carried out of the debris-filled building on stretchers.
A cascade of glass, metal and other material crashed onto the ground floor when part of the mezzanine level gave way. A Jakarta police spokesman said the collapse was an accident and not the result of an explosion.
National police spokesman Setyo Wasisto told AFP 75 people had been injured. There were no reports of deaths so far.
Television images showed chaotic scenes as victims were taken to hospital or lay on the ground outside the tower complex in the centre of the sprawling city?s business district.
?I saw many people bleeding,? student Rizki Noviandi, who was taking part in a competition at the exchange building, told Metro TV.
?So many people were carried out of the building and were left on the grass outside until the ambulances arrived.?
The lobby was filled with debris and toppled-over plants near a Starbucks coffee outlet, as hundreds of building employees were evacuated.
?Our search and rescue teams, the police, doctors, the firefighters are all still working,? Wasisto said.
?They are cleaning the debris and also searching for other possible injuries,? he added.
Those hurt mostly sustained injuries to their legs and arms, said Jakarta police spokesman Argo Yuwono.
?The accident happened at the first floor. It?s a floor where many employees are passing by. There are some victims but they have been taken to a nearby hospital,? Yuwono told reporters. The accident happened in one of two towers in the complex.
?There was a sound, like something had fallen off a building structure, for about 20 seconds. Everyone was panicking and people were immediately being evacuated,? Amailia Putri Hasniawati, a journalist based at the exchange, told AFP.
It was not immediately clear what caused the accident at the tower in Sudirman district, which was built?in 1995.
In 2000 at least 10 people were killed and dozens injured by a car bomb at the exchange complex.
Despite the chaos Monday, stock exchange spokesman Rheza Andhika said trade continued as usual in the afternoon session.
The accident happened shortly after noon local time (0500 GMT) while the market was on its lunchtime break.
?There was a loud banging so people who were inside immediately ran outside of the building,? said Metro TV journalist Marlia Zein.
The local office of the World Bank is housed on the 12th floor of the complex, according to?
its website.
Reports at the time of the 2000 bombing said one of the men responsible was a member of the Free Aceh Movement, a separatist group which had been fighting for a free Islamic state in Aceh province since the mid-seventies.
Some 200 cars were also damaged in the blast when the bomb exploded in an underground parking lot of the stock exchange building.

Grand reception was in vain
	
?
Elaborate arrangements had been made to accord a grand reception to a foreign delegation headed by a high political authority of that country at a very important state venue here.?
?
In fact, the organizers had liberally spent money on this reception which was to feature a variety of cultural features like dances, drum beating and conch-shell blowing.
The delegation was billed to arrive at the venue at 10.30 in the morning and the dance troupes and other artistes were waiting to go into action at the scheduled time. However, the foreign delegation had suddenly arrived at the venue shortly after 10 in the morning heading off the grand reception arranged for them and thus sending much effort and money that went into it down the drain, they say.?

A state purohita from a main political party who attended an electorate level youth conference held in Wayamba as the guest speaker recently got nettled when he saw there were more empty chairs than participants in the hall to greet him.?
?
Even before taking his seat, the state purohita angrily asked the organizers the reason for the poor turnout at the conference. When he received no response from the organizers who just sheepishly looked on, the purohita directed his anger at the audience. He ordered a youth seated in the front row to get up. ?You are a youth leader in your area??
?Yes, Sir!?
?How many youths did you bring to this conference??
?I came alone, Sir!?
?A fine youth leader,? the purohita murmured under his breath and said: ?Sit down.?
Now the purohita ordered the youth seated next to the first one to get up.
?How many persons did you bring to this conference??
?I came alone! Sir!? he too replied.?
The purohita asked from others too the same way as to how many activists had accompanied them and each of them gave the same answer: ?I came alone, Sir!?
The purohita who castigated them all said: ?You people are not worth the trouble we are taking for your sake!?
However, the youth participants subjected to this harangue appeared more amused than contrite, they say.

In keeping with the bank?s strategy to provide customers with first-class millennial banking experiences, National Development Bank PLC launched a new generation of cash recycling machines (CRM), of which the maiden CRM was deployed at Hemas Hospitals, Wattala.
NDB has constantly been driving progressive improvements into its ATM network and the CRM offers several new advancements on the standard ATMs.?

Apart from this, one of the main functions of a CRM is enabling cash deposits which are credited to the customer?s Current or Savings Accounts real time. These new machines represent a significant advancement in functionality and versatility while enhancing the Bank?s offering in 24x7 banking services. The machine can accept and count up to 200 notes at a time, in four denominations of currency notes ? Rs 5000, Rs 1000, Rs 500 and Rs 100 which eliminates the need for envelopes, making the machines more eco-friendly.
In 2016 NDB began its digital journey by introducing a state-of-the-art mobile banking app which changed market trends and set a benchmark in the market.?
The bank has now launched around-the-clock banking with this cash recycling machine at Hemas Hospitals in Wattala, and has planned to roll out the same in many other identified locations during the year 2018.?
NDB Bank has 121 ATMs throughout the island and cash recycling machines will soon add value to the NDB network by proving greater convenience to customers.

Not the first to form Govt. with UNP: MS
	
The very first attempt at forming a government with the help of the UNP was by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2007 and giving leadership to the ?yahapalana government? was nothing unusual, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He said he and Minister Anura Priyadharshana Yapa were asked to return during an official visit to Beijing by the former president in January 2007 to sign the two-party agreement to form a coalition government. He was then the general secretary of the SLFP.
At an election propaganda meeting at Ibbagamuwa, the President said he inquired from President Rajapaksa as to he they were asked to return in such a hurry.
?We are going to sign an agreement with the UNP to form a government,? he said.
?I went to the Temple Trees to sign the pact between the UNP and the SLFP. All senior UNP leaders including Ranil Wickremesinghe and Malik Samarawickrama were present. The agreement was ready. President Rajapaksa said the agreement has been drafted and let?s sign it. But I never participated in the discussion between the two parties or saw the draft either. But I signed it as instructed to do so. President Rajapaksa was able to rule the country only for a short time with the UNP and before it collapsed,? the President said.
?When I took over the country on January 9, 2015, the entire world had distanced Sri Lanka it was branded as a pariah state. Not even five countries among 193 members of the UN supported Sri Lanka,? he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa has been asked by many people to say why he went for an early presidential poll. "He has not answered this question but I will tell you why. One reason was that he could not face the pressure exerted by the international community. The second was the impending financial crisis due to the commercial loans obtained at high interest rates. Economic pundits had predicted that Sri Lanka was on the verge of an economic melt down," the President said. "Some ask me what I have done with the UNP in the past three years. I must tell you that, I put the Prime Minister and the Cabinet in charge of development and reconstruction and I went round the world meeting world leaders. In the process, I met Queen Elizabeth II, US President Barack Obama UN Secretary General Ban ki-Moon, Angela Merkel of Germany, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and many other top world leaders."
He said he was the first President in the world to have given up executive power and cut the term of office of the President.
"I am the only President who delegated the power to appoint top judicial officers to an independent commission from the Presidency. Today, no one talks about international war crime tribunals against Sri Lanka or the electric chair for our war heroes,? the President said. (Sandun A Jayaskera)

Offer of Korean jobs to win votes
	
?
This candidate from the Betel leaf party is in the local polls fray in an area considered the home turf of a very high political authority. He is said to be distributing application forms for jobs in Korea among the youth in the area assuring them that the jobs would be theirs if he were elected at the upcoming polls.?
?
The youths who have received the application forms from the candidate have begun attending Korean language classes which have mushroomed overnight, they say. Meanwhile, the Green party candidate and the Pohottuwa candidate in the running for the same local body have in a surprise move decided to use their combined might to defeat the Betel leaf candidate who has forged ahead in the race thanks to the Korean?job ruse.?

Palestinian leader calls Trump?s, peace deal the  ?slap of the century?
	
?
In a combative, two-hour speech brimming with colourful insults, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas denounced President Trump on Sunday, calling his forthcoming peace proposal ?the slap of the century.?? ?
He said Palestinians were being offered the Jerusalem suburb of Abu Dis as the capital of their future state, rather than East Jerusalem, which most of the international community considers illegally occupied by Israel. The area sits outside Israel?s security barrier and has been floated but rejected as a capital for a Palestinian state in previous negotiations.? ?We said no to Trump,? Abbas said. ?We won?t accept his project; his deal of the century is the slap of the century, and we will respond.?? Abbas was addressing members of the Palestinian Central Council as they began to discuss their response to the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel?s capital. Proposals include rescinding Palestinian recognition of Israel, pursuing Israel for war crimes at the International Criminal Court and advancing efforts for a Palestinian state to be recognized internationally.? ?
He questioned where Trump had offered negotiations. ?On the phone? On television??? ??I see a tweet,? he said. ?We will not give Palestinians money because they refuse to negotiate.?? ?Abbas has said that the United States can no longer be a fair arbiter for negotiations, but that the Palestinians are open to talks in line with the Arab Peace Initiative, a framework endorsed by the Arab League in 2002.? ?

?President isn?t cooperating with the JO?
	
AG has a lot of follow-up work to do prior to the institution of criminal proceedings regarding bond scam??
	President invited a stinging?rebuke by seeking?Supreme?Court?s opinion on his term? ?
	How can one?claim to be the paragon of virtue when one has allowed all these frauds to take place during?one?s term???
	Cover-up is a crime greater?than the bond scam itself? ?
	The appointment of the Bond Commission can?t be considered?as a massive virtue?
	It is by far the largest scam in the history of the country? ?
	The COPE members made hundreds of telephone calls to Perpetual Treasuries Ltd??
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris, in an interview with the Dailymirror, spoke about the controversial bond transaction, its implications and the Supreme Court?s opinion on the President?s term. Following are excerpts of the interview done with Prof. Peiris.? ?
?
QWhat is your position on the Supreme Court?s opinion that President Maithripala Sirisena?s term is five years?? ?
This is typical of the quality of advice the President acts upon. The law is crystal clear. The President simply invited a stinging rebuke which no other President received. It is a magnificent victory not only for the Joint Opposition, but also for the integrity of our court system and vitality of democratic system.? ?
?
??There is no difference between the UNP Ministers and the SLFP Ministers. The SLFP Minister admitted that PTL contacted him over the phone. After that the Minister concerned met them. It is already a question of credibility and public confidence?in COPE?
QIn the backdrop of the Presidential Commission that probed the Bond Scam presenting its report, how do you view it?? ?
There is no doubt that the two bond scams have shaken up the public opinion in the country. It is by far the largest scam in the history of the country. The fallout from this will affect at least two generations. President Maithripala Sirisena, in his address to the country, raised expectations to a high level that action was to be taken. The damage has been done. The public are going to pay for it through higher interests rates, inflation and devaluation of the rupee.? ?
The President appears to be taking an aggressive stance. It does not matter who is responsible. Whoever it is, the President said the person would be dealt with severely.? ?
What are the minimum things the President has to do? An unavoidable step is to dismiss the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister must resign. Unless he resigns, he has to be removed from office. That is the clear duty of the President. None of the things the President spoke of can be done while the Prime Minister holds office. Simply to say that the report of 1400 pages will be sent to the Attorney General for necessary action means nothing.? ?
QThe Government says the report is now with the Attorney General. It says it is up to the Attorney General. What is your response?? 
?
There is further investigation so the Attorney General can proceed with investigations. There is follow-up work to be done prior to the institution of criminal proceedings. There is no way that can be done objectively with the Prime Minister in charge. He has influenced the Attorney General by summoning him to his office. Then, the FCID has a lot of work to do. When it comes to the FCID, the Prime Minister is a critical player. He has been directing operations, giving directives. He is very much a central figure in all of this. As long as he is in office, no tangible action can be expected. There has been extensive debate in the country with regard to the two scams. There is one aspect that has not received the attention that it warrants. That is the orchestrated massive cover-up. The cover-up is a greater offence than the crime itself because it involves the cynical use of the state machinery. That cover-up is bound to continue so long as the Prime Minister continues to be in office.? ?
QHow do you substantiate your allegations in this respect?? ?
The public must remember the sequence of events. The storm broke because it was taken up by the primary dealers. The immediate response was to threaten the primary dealers. After that, the Prime Minister tried to whitewash the entire fraud by appointing three lawyers very close to him at Sirikotha. That was an obviously clumsy effort which attracted no credibility whatsoever. Then, the Joint Opposition became very active in this matter. It was taken up in Parliament. There was a no-confidence motion moved against Arjuna Mahendran. There was an adjournment motion. Then, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House were flippant on this matter. They were frivolous. These efforts were held up to ridicule. D.E.W. Gunasekara was the then COPE Chairman. The Prime Minister said that Mr. Gunasekara violated the parliamentary convention and that he would be reported to the Speaker. The Prime Minister got the President to dissolve Parliament then. Had that report been submitted at that time, the second fraud which was twice as big as the first fraud would not have taken place. What did the Prime Minister do under the new Parliament?? ?
He got his members in COPE to add footnotes to scuttle these operations. An attempt was made to go to the court and prevent a report from being compiled. He got a member of COPE to step down and be replaced by one of his men. He was then prevailed upon to write a book totally exonerating PTL. This was the extent of the attempted cover-up.? ?
The COPE members made hundreds of telephone calls to Perpetual Treasuries Ltd (PTL). The public must not forget the amount of money PTL was planning to spend on the cover-up. They paid their CEO Kasun Palisena Rs.100 million as bonus for one year. Then, how much would they have paid to influential members of the Government to sweep this under the carpet?? ?
?
?What are the minimum things the President has to do? An unavoidable step is to dismiss the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister must resign. Unless he resigns, he has to be removed from office. That is the clear duty of the President?
The COPE is the custodian of public finances. COPE is investigating PTL. At that time, COPE members were having communication with the main suspect. Some people said they were collecting material to write a book. The book has been published beforehand. The Ministers, Deputy Ministers and State Ministers are in discussion with PTL while sitting as COPE members. There is no difference between the UNP Ministers and the SLFP Ministers. The SLFP Minister admitted that PTL contacted him over the phone. After that the Minister concerned met them. It is already a question of credibility and public confidence in COPE. It is similar to a trail judge meeting with the accused in private. COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti said he was unaware that any member met Arjun Aloysius.??
If not for the sustained role of the Joint Opposition, these secret meetings would never have been exposed. The JO kept pursuing this all the time. This is the extent of the cover-up.? ?
QBut, it is the President who appointed this Commission?? ?
The President said he was wielding the sword. All these are his ministers. It is he who appointed them. It is he who has power to remove them.? ?
The country is looking to the President to turn his words into action. Is that going to happen or not?? ?
All of these are happening in a particular context. They criticize each other regarding the scam. Yet, there is collusion with each other. They criticize each other virulently. When it comes to the survival of each other, they are all together in order to reap the benefits collectively. Take for example the Finance Minister of the time! The Commission now says two things about him. One is that he must be prosecuted under the Penal Code for forgery for deliberately giving false evidence before the Commission . Then, he must be hauled up before the Bribery Commission. Currency notes of Sri Lanka bears the signatures of Ravi Karunanayake and Arjun Mahendran. Look at the insult to the nation!? ?
Nevertheless, there is a compelling need to continue with this arrangement, to somehow tie it together to prevent it from disintegration. There is a reason for that. In terms of the 19th Amendment, if it is a one party Government, there is constitutional restriction on the number of ministers. That should be 30. You can add 40 odd deputy and state ministers. If they part company, many of them will lose company. In order to retain office and enjoy perks, this arrangement continues. It is simply to share the spoils.? ?
If this is unacceptable to people, there is no point in supporting one party of the Government. Whether you support the blue elephant or the green elephant, they all are together. There is an interval of 13 months between the first scam and the second scam. President Sirisena dissolved Parliament to protect his Prime Minister.? ?
As for the appointment of Ravi Karunanayake as the Finance Minister, it is a very bad appointment from the beginning. It is impossible to disentangle the UNP from the SLFP and palm blames solely and exclusively on the UNP. The public cannot vote for an integral part of the incumbent Government.? ?
QBut the President made references to the Prime Minister. Then, the President said there had been the embezzlement of money from the COPE during the former rule which you also represented. What is your response?? ?
The behaviour of the Presidential Secretariat has been totally inconsistent and confusing. That is a characteristic feature of this Government. They do not know what they are doing. They cannot make up their mind. The President made the statement. Then, a faithful translation of it was published. After that, they removed the paragraphs that were critical of the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister. Again, they put it back on the website with reference to the Prime Minister and omitting the part critical of the Prime Minister. All of that shows how much juggling goes on in regards to this matter. That is a far cry from openness and candor. It is a political game. Now the truth must be discovered. Offenders must be pursued.? ?
The period between 2008 and 2014 was completely outside the terms of reference of the Commission. This is a red herring across the trail. The Prime Minister violated all parliamentary ethics by making a statement on the floor of Parliament when the Commission completed receiving evidence and began the task of preparing the report.? ?
?
?The President said he was wielding the sword. All these are his ministers. It is he who appointed them. It is he who has power to remove them.? ?The country is looking to the President to turn his words into action. Is that going to happen or not?? ?All of these are happening in a particular context. They criticize each other regarding the scam.?
Yet, there is collusion with each other?
QAre you trying to say that the President tried to clear the UNP of all allegations, and instead placed the blame on PTL?? ?
I do not think he has made up his mind on what he wants to do. He appears to be in a confused and disturbed state of mind. He wishes to harm the UNP politically. The UNP and his party are now contesting against each other. He has a vested interest in damaging the UNP. His original statement did that up to a point. But, at a certain point, he had to restrain himself. He has to work with the UNP. He is where he is today because of the UNP votes. That is a fundamental fact. In his mind, there are competing forces at work.
His principal aim is to blame the previous Government. There is already a report submitted by the Auditor General. If he wants to go into matters during the 2008/2014 period, he can do that.? ?
QThere is a belief that the President acts in collusion with the Joint Opposition (JO) to bring the UNP to disrepute. What is your view?? ?
The President isn?t cooperating with the JO at all. The JO only forced the President to appoint the Commission. Had it not been for the very vigorous campaign by the JO, it was impossible to believe that this commission would have been appointed.? ?
The appointment of the Commission cannot be presented as the massive virtue. How can one claim to be the paragon of virtue when one has allowed all these frauds to take place during one?s term? One is trying to lock the door once the horse has fled.? ?
Now, Arjuna Mahendran has been allowed to flee the country. He is allowed to come and leave at will.? ?
We do not see this as an act of virtue. It is an act of necessity and expediency.? ?

President walks out of the Cabinet meeting
	
A deeply dejected and disappointed President Maithripala Sirisena stormed out of the Cabinet meeting this morning after making an emotional speech over the personal attacks levelled at him by the certain members of the UNP, a senior Cabinet Minister said.
President naming those UNP Parliamentarians, who are making statements against him, had also said that a country cannot be ruled in this manner.
He has informed the Ministers present that the Presidential Commission was established by him not to attack the UNP, but to punish the thieves and requested the Ministers to state whether they agree to punishing the thieves or not.
The President who arrived for the Cabinet meeting carried with him a Tape Recorder, and showing it to those present he had said? Some may like to listen to my speech and some may not. But I will make this speech and those who wants to listen to it can do so later?.
President thereafter had spoken for about 35 minutes continuously and had the speech recorded.
? I left the former government showing my opposition to fraud and corruption, and formed a new government. Is it to continue the same frauds and corruption I ask you. It is true that UNP supporters voted for me, and I owe my gratitude to them. Are the UNP members attacking me to frighten me? Or to chase me out? I do not know whether they are doing these things with a purpose or others leading them to do such things. I walked out that day ignoring the risks I would have to face. Therefore this type of criticisms are not something new to me. Some UNP members are going round saying that the Bond Commission was appointed in order to attack the UNP. I appointed the Bond Commission in order to probe the Bond scam. I have no personal issues with any one. (Sandun A Jayasekera and Ajantha Kumara Agalakada)

Presidential election next year: Ajith P. Perera
	
A presidential election has to be held next year in line with the Supreme Court determination which states that the President could hold office only for five years, Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said yesterday.
?The SC determination makes it clear that a presidential election has to be held in November or December next year on the basis that the current President's tenure ends in January 2020,? he said at a public rally in Maha Bellana over the weekend.
The deputy minister said the constitution might be changed and the executive presidency abolished by then resulting in there being no reason for anyone to think about a presidential election.
?A mandate was given for a new constitution and to abolish the executive presidency. President Sirisena was elected on the promise of carrying out these political reforms,? he said. ?The President is right in seeking such a determination to clear any ambiguity or doubts. The current Parliament will go on for five years. President has no power to dissolve Parliament till it completes four and a half years of its term. There is no provision in the 19th amendment to remove the Prime Minister. The President has to consult the Prime Minister when appointing a minister. Parliament has power to allocate funds for all ministries. Political turmoil is avoided with the 19th Amendment. The SC determination had confirmed that the 19th Amendment is in operation. That is why the UNP did intervene on this matter." (Yohan Perera)

Singapore Central Bank?head hopes cryptocurrency tech will survive ?crash?
	
REUTERS: Singapore?s Central Bank head said yesterday he hoped the technologies underpinning cryptocurrencies such as blockchain would not be undermined by an eventual crash in the virtual coins.
The city-state is among many global Central Banks voicing concern about potential losses for citizens and money laundering through cryptocurrencies. But it is carrying out extensive research into the distributed ledger technology that underlies bitcoin.
?I do hope when the fever has gone away, when the crash has happened, it will not undermine the much deeper, and more meaningful technology associated with digital currencies and blockchain,? Ravi Menon, the Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), said at a UBS Wealth Insights event in Singapore.
South Korea, a crucial source of global demand for cryptocurrencies, said last week it plans to ban cryptocurrency trading, a move that sent bitcoin and other virtual coin?
prices plummeting.
The value of bitcoin surged around 1,500 percent last year to peak at nearly US$20,000 in December. However, it has broadly fallen since then and on Monday was trading around US$13,572 on Luxembourg-based Bitstamp.
On a question of whether Central Banks should launch cryptocurrencies to sell directly to the public, Menon said that while he couldn?t rule it out in Singapore, he wasn?t sure it would be a good idea.
In one of the only examples of a country planning to launch a cryptocurrency, crisis-hit Venezuela plans a virtual token backed by oil as a way to try to raise hard currency and to evade financial sanctions imposed by Washington.

Joint Opposition MP Keheliya Rambukwella said today Speaker Karu Jayasuriya should respectfully resign from his post in connection with the recent fracas in Parliament.
He said they accepted the Speaker?s statement that the turmoil in Parliament was planned and organized because the Prime Minister came with a lengthy statement instead of tabling the PCoI report in parliament.
?It is true that what happened was organized and planned. Party leaders had agreed at their meeting to table the PCoI report. It was the only business in the order paper of the day. But the Speaker informed us that he had not received the report and it was then that the Prime Minister started making a lengthy statement. Who planned it? Was the speaker unaware of the Prime minister?s speech,? the MP asked.
He claimed that the Prime Minister threatened the speaker and asked him for the mike and added that the Speaker should go home respectfully over this incident.
The MP said the Prime Minister threatened the speaker saying ?Give me the mike. Otherwise I will remove you from there,? then the speaker gave the mike to the PM.
?We feel sorry and ashamed at what happened to the speaker. He should go home respectfully,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Speaker to hold inquire into brawl in Parliament
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is expected to hold an inquiry into the brawl between government and the joint opposition parliamentarians on January 10, Parliament sources said yesterday.
They said the Speaker had decided to hold an inquiry because some MPs have accused him of being responsible for the brawl while some MPs were of the view that such a brawl would not have occurred if he suspended sittings and convened a party leaders meeting, which the Speaker had done amid the melee.
Party leaders who met on January 9 had decided to meet on the following day to decide on the course of action to be taken on the Bond Commission report which was expected to be tabled in Parliament that day.
A similar inquiry was held after a scuffle that took place in Parliament in 2016 and two MPs -- Palitha Thewaraperuma and Prasanna Ranaweera being suspended after they had exchanged fisticuffs inside the chamber. (Yohan Perera)

The Survey Department has completed revision work covering over 60% of Sri Lanka?s geographical map, Surveyor General P.M.P. Udayakantha said yesterday.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Mr. Udayakantha said the department had completed re-drawing 65 parts of Sri Lanka?s geographical map which consists of 92 in total in the 1: 50,000 (1 centimeter = 0.5 kilometer) ratio category and the rest of work would be completed by the end of this year.
The final map was drawn in 2000 and since then the country had undergone many changes including expansion of land masses during the past18 years due to the mega scale infrastructure development projects.
Mr. Udayakantha said 2.6 square kilometers had added to the country?s topographical details with the land reclamation to the new Colombo port city enhancing the country?s land area recently.
He explained that the Moragahakanda, once marked as a forest in the map had now been changed entirely due to the multipurpose irrigation project.
Further he said the satellite technology were used in mapping the country and later the department officials conducts a field study to confirm the data.
The department is hoping to conclude the entire mapping by the end of this year. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

What happened to me happened to Maithri as well: MR
	
Former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said same fate had befallen on both him and President Maithripala Sirisena, because both of their tenures of presidency had been reduced by at least one year.
Addressing a Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) rally held in Kaduwela, he said he made a mistake by calling for presidential election two years prior to his tenure was expired.
?I call it a sacrifice. When things go wrong, let?s call it a sacrifice. (laughter among people). I was labelled as a dictator back then. Whose the dictator now? The President wanted to see if he could hold office for six years instead of five. What happened to me happened to Maithri as well. That?s what called Dittha dhamma vedaniya kamma,? he said.
He said the President might have asked for the Supreme Court opinion over the tenure after giving into advises of those around him. ?Now that he has lost, he is coming up with various excuses. Losing is good. Then you get to know people well,? he said.
Commenting on President Sirisena?s decision to withdraw two gazettes which reformed business hours of liquor stores and lift ban on women purchasing liquor, Mr. Rajapaksa said it seemed a setup.
?The President is aspiring to spearhead the Temperance Movement. There are more pressing issues in the country. A 14-year-old girl was raped and killed recently. Underworld crimes are escalating. Attention should be made to these issues,? he said.
Meanwhile, he said the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) today follows Chandrika Bandaranaike principles instead of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike principles.
He invited people to come and cast their votes to the SLPP at the Local Government election to be held on February 10. ?To rectify the mistake made on January 8 (2015), come vote for lotus bud on February 10,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The family elders are livid that the candidate has used the picture of his dead father in the posters he has put out to win the sympathy vote of his father?s loyal followers. They have urged the candidate to remove these posters which they claim is an insult to his father. However, he had pleaded with them saying, ?Aiyo, how can I remove them at this stage!?, they say.? ? ? ?

Wijeyadasa?s security pruned
	
Former justice minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe?s security has been reduced by recalling five of of seven officers of the ministerial security detail.
MP Rajapakshe said the security officers had been recalled even without informing him.
?No prior notice was given about a reduction on the security detail. When I inquired from the Ministerial Security Division (MSD) Chief as to what had happened, he said he was instructed by the IGP to leave behind only two officers with me because I?m an MP now. However, when the MSD Chief had asked the IGP whether the security detail of 11 members given to MP Ravi Karunanayke should also be reduced to two, the IGP had told him not to touch Ravi?s security detail,? he said.
Mr. Rajapakshe also claimed that in addition to MSD security, Special Task Force Personnel were also provided to Ministers Faizer Musthapa, Thalatha Athukorale, Mano Ganeshan, Rishad Bathiudeen and MP M.A. Sumanthiran.

Women?s movements   have to be stronger
	
The upcoming Local Government Election has been a much anticipated event in the local political calendar. In the run up for positions, both known and unknown faces have begun their campaigns abiding to stricter laws than what was seen during the previous regime. With a new electoral system, both citizens and those contesting are expecting further ?change?. Among those contesting from the Green Party, Rosy Senanayake, former beauty queen and present Deputy Chief of Staff at the Prime Minister?s Office, hopes to further her political ambitions and become Colombo?s first female mayor.
In a candid interview with the Dailymirror, Senanayake shared her views with us. Following are excerpts of the interview.
?
QYou wish to be the first female mayor in Colombo. How do you feel about it?? ?
I view it both as an honour and an enormous responsibility. When it comes to women in public service, 62% of the Government sector is staffed by women, but only a small minority are in decision making positions. But how many are corporate chairpersons and on boards? How many are CEOs or even secretaries to ministries? With my election as mayor, people will see that it is time this changes and that there is a crucial need to elevate women to positions of leadership and responsibility.? ?
By electing a female mayor, Colombo will be showing the country and the world that it is ready to transcend gender stereotypes and be an epicenter of progress and change. I am proud that I will be the first woman who is being given the opportunity to take the mantle of this wonderful City and very proud also of the men and women of this City who are showing that they value ability, hard work, and integrity above all else.? ?
I am aware that becoming the first female mayor brings with it huge responsibility. As a woman, I will have to do more than just live up to expectations. I will have to exceed them. And I plan to do just that! I also realize that I will be seen as a pioneer for women holding very high leadership positions in Government and people will be watching me to see how women perform in positions of leadership. My performance in this role will have repercussions for future female leaders. I am confident that I will be able to lead Colombo to make it a safe, smart, economically viable, and corruption-free City which caters to and empowers all sections of its citizenry, leaving no doubt about the leadership potential and efficacy of women!? ?
QThe Capital is where women face a lot of harassment in public transport and other places. How will you ensure the safety of women while in your position?? ?
The harassment of women in public transport and other public places is a huge concern and something that needs to be addressed immediately. There is no point in talking about more representation for women or a louder voice for women, if women can?t do something as basic as getting from point A to point B, without fear of being harassed sexually or otherwise in a verbal, visual, or physical manner. It?s frankly unacceptable that a woman might dread her daily commute to work or other public interactions because of what she fears experiencing in the bus, train and on the street.?
? However, while changing attitudes and belief systems are important and need to be started immediately, it takes time to bear fruit.? ?
?
?
My plans are for a smart, safe, economically viable and corruption-free city where people will enjoy dividends
?
Therefore, some of the more tactical strategies that could be put in place to provide more immediate solutions include the following; ensuring that streets and pathways are well lit and exposed, commissioning more CCTVs and targeting the use of CCTV for this purpose, panic button stations that activate alarms and bright flashing lights when activated from within a certain radius, working closely with law enforcement to ensure that sexual harassment in public is something they are always alert to and respond to immediately, requiring that buses/trains that enter the city have panic bells that could be activated by buttons placed in the bus/train or even from a mobile phone, apps that link to a database that can log complaints and highlight locations of frequent harassment, encouraging documenting the harassment if possible (e.g. take a picture of perpetrator committing act) and report it via app or internet, encouraging a ?see something, say something? approach in the general public, ensure transport crews are more vigilant etc.? ?
QAs the mayoral candidate for the UNP what are the immediate issues that need to be looked into in the Colombo city?? ?
My plans are for a smart, safe, economically viable and corruption-free city, one in which people will benefit, one that is environmentally friendly and where the people will enjoy dividends. All levels of society will be empowered and strengthened. One?
?
I am very confident that the UNP will win
	I will have to do more than just live up to expectations? ?
	It?s unfair that my son?s name was linked to the Bond Scam? ?
	Previous regime didn?t find green and safe solutions for garbage disposal?
	Yes, Gotabhaya pulled down walls of Govt. buildings and ?beautified? the City
	I have already put in place the processes for green and smart planning in all City activities
?
of its main focuses includes The Effectiveness and Efficiency of CMC. I plan to leverage ICT to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the CMC thereby enabling many services and functions to be digitalized. These include online applications, payments, E-procurements etc. I also intend to establish a high level Monitoring and Progress Review Unit reporting directly to the Mayor to tackle issues, public complaints and requests (with response deadlines) to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of all activities and functions of CMC. A Healthy City and A Healthy Citizenry is another pillar in my plans. One of the priorities will be tackling dengue. We will control dengue by identifying hotspots of dengue using past data and the new app ?Epi Hack? and prioritizing areas with the highest dengue incidence. Other approaches include a Central Control Unit which will focus on quality control of food in city eateries, Multifunctional Community Centers (MCCs) to empower the community and tackle a variety of issues by reinvigorating and strengthening existing community centres and establishing new ones.?
?
I?m also focusing on ?Participatory Citizenship? where I will actively involve the citizenry in the activities of the CMC?
?
Infrastructure is another priority. I will make maximum use of CMC?s powers to ease the burden of traffic for those living and working in Colombo.? ?
Cultural Development is another pillar of a new and revitalized Colombo. To cater to the future demands, we have space and areas that we have already identified to turn into restaurant strips, tourist strips and for the residents to have leisure activities such as hawker streets. I?m also focusing on ?Participatory Citizenship? where I will actively involve the citizenry in planning, implementation and monitoring the policies and activities of the CMC.? ?
I have deliberately left the description of my plans for women and children to last, because this is something especially close to my heart. In this area, among other things, I will be focusing on Maternal and Child healthcare and a nutrition package, establishing new day care centres and monitoring existing ones etc. I am happy to say that I was able to bring to Sri Lanka a subject called ?Think Equal,? which is a social and emotional value-based education which begins at pre-school; much-needed in today?s society? ?
I will also focus on drop-in centres for street children and the homeless, family strengthening programs to prevent institutionalization of children and school entry programs to facilitate school admission with regard to children of urbanites.? ?
QThe New electoral system and the law have become challenges for candidates when promoting themselves. What are your views?? ?
Actually the new system makes it easier for candidates to campaign. Now a candidate has to campaign only within his or her Ward. The huge amounts of money previously spent on obtaining preferential votes under the Proportional Representation (PR) system is no longer necessary and we therefore have a more equal playing field with less wastage. Minority parties are still protected because this is a mixed system and each party is entitled to appoint a number of members proportionate to the total number of votes received by that party in all the wards.? ?
QHow confident are you that the UNP will win the LG polls and you would be elected to office?? 
?
I am very confident. Colombo is a UNP stronghold and even in the last Local Government Elections when we were not in power nationally, we easily won the CMC.? ?
QIn terms of women?s rights and their inclusion, Sri Lanka has to progress more when compared to the rest of the world. What key areas still need change?? ?
Security, livelihood and discriminatory laws against women and female-headed households are key areas. Even at present, women go to the Middle East for a pittance. I don?t think as a Government we have negotiated well enough with regard to safety and salary of females who are employed overseas. Empowering women economically in a sustainable and viable manner ? that?s something the Prime Minister has been reiterating recently. He says he will improve standards and bring in more economic avenues for women, so that they won?t have to go and struggle in the Middle East.??
Security is one of the major issues due to violence against women in this country, in addition to nutrition. It?s important that the community and decision makers be more educated about the effects of violence against women. We also don?t realise how many pregnant mothers are malnourished in the far-flung villages.? ?
?
By electing a female mayor, Colombo will be showing the country and the world that it is ready to transcend gender stereotypes and be an epicenter of progress and change?
?
?
There are other social areas as well. We have a huge female-headed household rate. One in every third household is headed by a woman. Single parenting is an issue. We need to have more social welfare. Today even if a woman wants to start a small business, she can?t go to a bank, given the things that they ask for, such as collateral. We need to see how we can help women start businesses. I believe that is an area we need to concentrate on, especially in relation to women in the north and east and in the Deep South, who are suffering.? ?
QAs a woman who has been in the political arena for some time, what changes could have possibly taken place if more women were in politics?? ?
The evidence shows that female leaders typically have more compassion and empathy. They have a more open and an inclusive negotiating style. This is a generality, of course- there are many types of leadership styles, both male and female. But women have traits more in line with modern ideas of transformative leadership; empathy, inclusiveness and an open negotiation style.
Having women in positions of political leadership impacts how policy resources are spent- either through gender budgeting efforts or simply, such as in the case of climate change, showing how women experience issues differently than men. Women?s leadership also helps drive direct change in structural policies including parental leave, child care and pay. Studies systematically show that female politicians are more likely to concentrate on issues that matter more to women such as day care, gender equality, reproductive rights, flex time, elderly care, children?s welfare.? ?
?
I am aware that becoming the first female mayor brings with it huge responsibility?
?
QDo you think the LG polls would change the political landscape and encourage more women to enter the political scene?? ?
Yes definitely. I have been fighting for this! One of the major things the Prime Minister did was bring in the bill to ensure that 25% women are in local Government. That was an initial bill that he passed in the new Government. I am the most elated about this. Although I brought in a private member motion asking for 30% of women, it was thrown out. After much opposition it became 25% but I am happy with it. Next we are looking at the provincial councils with the last amendment and 25% women have been added on.? ?
While ensuring that more women will join politics, the next has to be a quota for parliamentary seats. In Parliament, I strongly believe that it is the PR system that is depriving women of their rightful access. You need an enormous amount of money for an election. A lot of women who want to enter politics are being discouraged as they have to go through gun and character assassination. For me, affirmative action is the only way forward and 25% is not enough. That should be the minimum, but more would be even better. We need to make it mandatory and use affirmative action with regard to the electoral systems in this country. The women?s movements have to be stronger and advocate for this.? ?
QThe findings of the Bond issue have imposed a black mark on the UNP and a few members in the Government as well. What is your stance regarding this case?? ?
?I am proud that this Government has stood up against corruption and ordered a thorough investigation into this issue. The President and PM appointed a commission with wide-ranging powers to investigate and their report has now been finalized and forwarded by the PM and President to the Attorney General?s Department for their opinion.??
?
There is no point in talking about more representation for women if women can?t do something as basic as getting from point A to point B, without being harassed?
?
By conducting such a thorough investigation into this issue the Government has created a huge deterrent for Government servants to be corrupt or aid in corruption. This alone should be viewed as a big win for the Government.? ?
One of the recommendations of the PCOI is that previous instances of irregularity in bond issuance, including that in 2008 under the previous regime be investigated. It is essential that those instances also be investigated with no delay.? ?
QYour son?s name also surfaced regarding the issue. What are your views regarding these allegations?? ?
I was surprised and shocked. My participation in COPE proceedings concluded on June 26, 2015 when I ceased to be a Member of Parliament. This allegation is from a third-party conversation on August 12, 2016, by which time I had long ceased to be an MP.? ?
I immediately wrote to the Speaker of Parliament categorically denying any wrongdoing either on my part or that of my son and I also wrote to the Prime Minister and I said I want an investigation because I want my name cleared. In the 100-day COPE, there was no report. D.E.W. Gunasekara tried to rush and bring a report, but Sujeewa Senasinghe, Eran Wickramaratne and everyone on that committee, including the TNA members, said the investigation had not been completed, so there can?t be a report.? ?
It was so unfair that my son?s name was linked. I have already written to the Speaker in this regard.? ?
?
QThe beautification project carried out by Gotabhaya Rajapakse seems to have stopped. How will you plan out a cleaner, greener Colombo?? ?
While it is true that Gotabhaya Rajapakse made many cosmetic changes to Colombo, our vision is both broader and deeper.? ?
As I have said we will focus on making Colombo a greener cleaner City. Yes we will have more parks and develop existing ones, we will have cleaner and nicer roads and pavements. We will ensure that Colombo is a place of beauty. I have already put in place the processes for green and smart planning in all City activities.? ?
However, the changes we intend to make go beyond the merely superficial. Under the previous regime, no thought was given to finding green and safe solutions to garbage disposal. In fact no thought was given to even finding permanent dumping places for garbage. A garbage dump was created in Meethotamulla, ignoring the many protests of local residents, ignoring studies warning against it by the World Bank and others and we all know of the consequences. The garbage landslide, the loss of lives, the destruction of homes, the displacement of families were all foreseeable, but ignored by the previous regime. Even prior to the landslide around 30 people in the area had died due to killer germs, outbreak of dengue, kidney diseases, rat fever and skin conditions.? ?
?
?
The evidence shows that female leaders typically have more compassion and empathy. They have a more open and an inclusive negotiating style?
?
We have already identified a permanent dumping ground in Puttalam, we have already started implementing projects for hazardous waste, recycling, addressing clinical waste issues, and waste to energy etc.? ?
Yes, Gotabhaya pulled down walls of Government buildings and ?beautified? the City. We will certainly be beautifying the City also, but we will be doing so in a sustainable and truly green manner.???

Zero-tolerance over violence against children: SL
	
Sri Lanka maintains a zero-tolerance policy regarding cases of violence?against children and is committed to bring perpetrators to justice as?expeditiously as possible, the government said yesterday.
In Sri Lanka?s opening statement at the 77th Session of the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) held at the Palais Wilson in Geneva, Women and Child Affairs Secretary Chandrani Senaratne?said adequate laws have been put in place?in this regard.
?At the?level of implementation, 42 children?s and Women?s bureaus have established?at police stations across the country to look into complaints pertaining to children.?The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) also accepts public complaints on child abuse and channels such complaints to law enforcement agencies,? she said.
She said the Justice Minister in?November 2017 has established a Special Committee on Reforms in Justice for?Children,?as a follow up to a joint study conducted with UNICEF, to review the?recommendations of the assessment report about the status of justice for?children in Sri Lanka.
Over decades, Ms.?Senaratne?said Sri Lanka?has?built a viable child protection system, which covers the entire country with over 1,500 dedicated staff at grass root levels and administrators.
?Compared to the South Asian region data, the ratio of children in institutional care, and stunting in children under five is relatively low (13%) in Sri Lanka and the situation has further improved over the last decade,? she said.?
However, she noted that about 200,000 children under five years are suffering from acute malnutrition in Sri Lanka?and that they were?working with UNICEF and World Health Organization to address the issue.
Meanwhile, she said pursuant to land releases, as at end October 2017, the?government?had resettled a total of 256,972?families consisting of 891,125 individual?persons.
?It has also rehabilitated 12,182 former combatants including 594 child?soldiers. Landmines have been cleared in approximately 135.4 square?kilometers in the North and the East from 2002 to 2017. Mine clearing in the?remaining 25.5 square kilometers is in progress,? she said. ?
