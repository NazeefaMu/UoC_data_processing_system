A ploy to safeguard the family interests
	
There are two siblings  an Akka and Malli  in the thick of politics whose family interests would remain unaffected, they say, no matter which party is in power for they represent the two main political parties.
The Malli, a purohita of a previous regime, lost his seat in a district located in an area where a kingdom once flourished. However, he is in active politics.
The Akka too in active politics, sporting a different political colour, successfully contested the recent mini-polls on the Pohottuwa list.
Politics of this Akka- Malli duo has become a good joke for the people in their area who say that whichever the party that comes to power, it would be invariably either Akkas or Mallis and their family fortunes would remain intact!

A Tribute to Ignatius Thavayogam Canagaretnam (Former Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police)   A
	
More things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of, These immortal lines of Alfred Lord Tennyson reflected in the life of late Ignatius T. Canagaretnam former Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police (affectionately called IT by his relatives and friends), who passed away on January 10, 2018 at the age of 81 years after a brief illness. 
IT would always be remembered by his innumerable friends, relatives and all other associates for his excellent quality of head and heart. He viewed life as a pre-ordained opportunity to attain perfection through a blend of human and divine love and then to blaze a righteous trail for others to follow and perpetuate. In fact his consideration for others was something that welled up from within, a natural outcome of his conviction that the whole world was one family.
Indeed, I consider it a great honour and privilege to have met and known him as a good friend, he was more than a friend and treated me always as a brother. He was a noble gent with sterling qualities who helped me on numerous occasions when I was precariously and perilously pushed into the vertex of dire difficulties. His motto was - What the right hand gives, the left hand should not know. So selfless a soul was he and so enthusiastic about the affairs of others. Being benevolent and sweet by nature he soon found his place in the heart of everyone. The loneliest, the most wretched received compassion in his hands. Love and forgive, live and let live  he would always say. 

He possessed a tower of positive thoughts and kind consoling words. He would not be disturbed by problems and would face themwith determination
Mr. Canagaretnam had his entire education at St. Michaels College, Batticaloa and came under the moral, social and intellectual influence of great Jesuit priests Rev.Fr. S.J. Crowther and the legendary Rev. Fr. Harold Weber. He left St. Michaels College after passing the senior school certificate exam, (SSC) and joined the Sri Lanka Police force as a trainee Sub Inspector. 
He served the police force with honesty, integrity and efficiency in many areas of the island. He rapidly rose in the ranks of his chosen profession as Inspector of Police, Superintendent of Police, Senior Superintendent of Police and then finally as Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police through sheer grit and hard work. His record had been straight and very impressive. His greatness was self made and God ordained. In fact the secret of Ignatius Canagaretnam as a dedicated, devoted and disciplined person was due to the fact that he was deeply religious with an unblemished character and versatile intellect. By his simplicity and sincerity he endeared himself to all those who came in contact with him. His gentle nature and kindness made everyone feel at ease in his company. He had an extremely charming personality which helped him to go out of his way to help everyone who sought his assistance expecting nothing in return. He possessed a tower of positive thoughts and kind consoling words. He would not be disturbed by problems and would face them with determination.
As the famous poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow once wrote of such people: 
The lives of great men reachedand kept 
Were not obtained in sudden flight 
For they, while their companions slept 
Were toiling upward in the night. 
Ignatius Thavayogam Canagaretnam would always be remembered for his kindness and love. On a personal note I lost a good friend, mentor and guide with whom I spent and enjoyed a lot of useful time. His demise was a great blow to everyone who knew him. To the feeble he brought the power of strength, to the sinner the liberation of forgiveness, to the suffering the peace of mercy.

He served the police force with honesty, integrity and efficiency in many areas of the island. He rapidly rose in the ranks of his chosen profession as Inspector of Police, Superintendent of Police, Senior Superintendent of Police and then finally as Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police through sheer grit and hard work
Furthermore to his wife, sons, daughters-in-law and grandchildren, I wish to express my sympathies for having lost a beloved husband, loving father, a good father-in-law, a wonderful grandfather and a good-hearted and noble gent to all his associates. 
I wish to conclude with the following: Goodnight Sweet Prince and the flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest

A walk down memory lane
	
When I woke up on the 10th of January 2018, never in my wildest dreams did I think that before the end of the day, I would be informed of the passing away of one of my nearest and dearest friends. 
My friendship with Hemantha Karunaratne spreads across almost forty years. I first met him on a trip with my cousins, two of whom are Seevali Jayawickreme and the late Harshin Jayawardhane (both Hemantha`s neighbours). From then on grew a lasting friendship and a special bond between us. These many years hold only good memories, with some more outstanding than the rest.
During my years at the Land Reforms Commission, I accompanied Hemantha on most of his business trips out of Colombo and invariably, these ended as good leisure outings. A trip to Bandarawela and many visits to Anuradhapura are deeply etched in my memory. Wherever we met, we never failed to reminisce on the good old days. 
Due to our mutual love of music, we spent many hours listening and singing along to our favourite songs

Even after Hemantha got married, I always received a warm welcome in his home by him and his family. A special trip to Kataragama with them brings back such happy memories. Due to our mutual love of music, we spent many hours listening and singing along to our favourite songs. No gathering was complete without a song from Hemantha and me. 
Hemantha, for all his fun-loving ways, was a good son, brother, husband, father and a friend. Many times, he gave me sound, helpful advice. He was kind-hearted, generous and never failed to help the less fortunate. If memories could bring him back, he would certainly be here with us now.
My dear friend, it is three months since you have left us.
May you attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!

Channa Jayawickreme

It also warned people not to travel in open vehicles, such as bicycles, tractors and boats.
It advised the public to be vigilant of fallen trees and power lines and requested the public to contact the local disaster management authorities in case of emergency. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

In 2016, Jayanthi and Johann were the first Sri Lankans to undertake the challenge of summiting Everest.

And now, he is going back to settle some unfinished business!

Everest on it, making this a very special sponsorship for us!

Bending the law to help those breaking the law!
	
Two white collar high-ups now confined to the state-run lodge for a custodial spell are being provided with the best of comforts there, they say.
They are reportedly being accommodated in the executives lounge meant for the top men of the place instead of in cells where the mates of their kind are held. They are also provided with a land phone facility while being allowed to use mobile phones.
Some employees of the lodge are said to be openly wondering why this duo is being allowed a cushy time in the executives lounge when there are special cells meant for mates requiring special security.

CPC fuelling huge losses daily; Ministry
	
The Petroleum Resources Development Ministry yesterday said that Ceylon Petroleum Corporation had to incur an additional loss of Rs. 380 million a day since fuel prices are not being increased.
Ministry Secretary Upali Marasinghe said the loss has increased manifold now as CPC sheds sold more fuel now after the Lanka IOC increased fuel prices recently.
He said it was not feasible to run the corporation due to the losses accumulating daily since 2015. He said the matter was brought to the notice of the Finance Ministry several times and he hoped the Finance Ministry would find a solution to this crisis soon.
Meanwhile, the sale of Diesel in CPC sheds has increased from 4500 metric tonnes 5500 MT and Petrol from 2500 MT to 3000 MT daily after Lanka IOC increased fuel prices recently. (Mahinda Nissanka)

Cruelty to animals  A burning issue that needs to be addressed urgently
	

The Animal Welfare Coalition in Sri Lanka condemns the cruelty addressed to a leopard that was killed in Ginigathhena, by unidentified individuals. The animal is said to have been caught in a trap set in a tea estate, and then before being killed had been brutally tortured by having chopped off its paws. The Coalition expresses its shock at the inhumane treatment meted out to the animal and highlights the need for laws that would take robust action against perpetrators of cruelty towards animals.
Wild animals of Sri Lanka are protected under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance which has as its objective the conservation of the wildlife heritage of Sri Lanka. Under the Ordinance, it is an offence to hunt or kill any animal in a strictly natural reserve, national park, nature reserve or jungle corridor, and provides that no person shall hunt, shoot, kill or take any wild animal, or take or destroy any egg of any bird or reptile or any nest of any bird, in any Sanctuary. [ 3, 44 of 1964.] Further the Cruelty to Animals Ordinance of Sri Lanka (1907) in section 2 (a) provides that it is an offence to cruelly beat, abuse or torture an animal. However, the law remains restricted and with limited application due to its penalties which is a LKR 100/- fine/ and 3 months imprisonment, and the difficulties that it creates due to the definition of animals which excludes wild animals, and only includes any animal that is domestic or captured, and includes any fish, reptile, or bird in captivity.
The cruel acts committed against the leopard in question could be considered as falling under the 1907 Ordinance as it as an animal in captivity at the time of the acts being committed against it. It is absolutely shocking that the cruelty of the acts, and actions such as these should not be punished, said Convener of the Animal Welfare Coalition, Attorney-at-Law, Vositha Wijenayake. She further highlighted the need to address the human animal conflict in an efficient manner, which will reduce the tensions between animals and humans. It is important that human animal conflicts are addressed in an efficient manner, and not ignored. If they are addressed effectively, the tensions between humans and animals would become lesser. This could contribute to not having to face situations such as the ones we are facing and we need the Animal Welfare Bill to be enacted so as to address issues of cruelty to animals in an effective manner, she said. 
Animal Welfare Coalition is a collective of organisations working with the objective of advocating and lobbying for animal welfare in Sri Lanka, and addressing the issue of curbing cruelty to animals in the country.

Dutch tourists brutally assaulted
	
Some tourists including a Dutch male and two other women tourists were reported to have been brutally assaulted in Mirissa on Sunday morning when they resisted attempts to sexually assault the women.
The group had gone to a Surf Bar and Restaurant on the Mirissa beach where the assault had occurred. According to eyewitnesses, the group had been enjoying dinner and drinks at the Surf Bar and Restaurant on Saturday night when waiters at the restaurant had attempted to sexually harass the women.
They tried to dance near us and groped us from time to time during the night one the females said. The females had, however, resisted the advances and stayed together with the group. The attempts to sexually assault the females had gone on during the night from time to time.
The night started fun until more and more local guys began to inappropriately touch the girls in our group and also other tourist girls at the bar. We complained about this to the guys working at the bar, but they laughed at us and continued to laugh every time a local guy harassed a girl. After a while, we decided to leave until things escalated between local guys and a group of tourists Raffie Van Maren a 19-year-old Dutch national told Daily Mirror.
Maren says he attempted to inform the management throughout the night of the harassment to no avail,
Visitors to Mirissa said that the behaviour of the employees is a common occurrence. The waiters are youth from the area colloquially referred to  Beach boys.
The escalation of the incident to the assault had occurred after one of the locals had attempted to rub his penis on a females shoulder whilst they were seated.
When I saw this I told the guy that this was unacceptable, and the girl, in shock, stood up and got really angry with him. Things started to escalate and while this was going on, we decided to get out of there as soon as possible. We walked towards the exit of the beach when we saw local guys running towards us. One guy we were with got punched to the ground and was repeatedly kicked and punched by 5 or 6 guys at the same time, all of these guys had been in the Surf Bar and Restaurant before Maren said.
Thereafter a group of around eight to 10 locals had mercilessly assaulted Maren and two other females from Briton.
One guy we were with got punched to the ground and was repeatedly kicked and punched by 5 or 6 guys at the same time, all of these guys had been in the Surf Bar and Restaurant before. One local started running towards me but before I knew I was on the ground getting punched and kicked at by eight guys at the same time. I was screaming and shouting but they did not care and kept going for at least ten minutes. My forehead was busted open as well as my right ear and my right arm he said.
A female victim who was assaulted detailing the incident said that she and her friend were punched by the group after which 4 men had attempted to take her to bed.
One man pushed my friend (names withheld due to safety reasons), pulled her hair back and punched her in the back of the head. In the commotion I lost our group including my friend, I walked further down the beach to try and find them and a group of four men approached me and told me to come with them one of them was insisting that he would "stay in my bed tonight" she said. The victim and her friend had thereafter been assaulted again by the group.
 A man from the previous group of attackers came running towards us shouting " repeatedly and tried to punch my friend. He then pushed me forcefully to the ground and began kicking me, the victim said.
Tourist around the area told Daily Mirror that attempts to sexually assault women are rampant in the area and assaults such as this occur from time to time.
 These are tourists and they dont want to go through the entire ordeal of the legal process in Sri Lanka. They are here for a short time and therefore the incidents often go unreported an owner of one of the properties in Mirissa told Daily Mirror.
However, the two victims have lodged complaints with the Tourist Police via electronic mail.
Earlier a British National Khuran Shaikhy was murdered in 2011 and his girlfriend was raped by locals creating international media attention on the safety of tourists in Sri Lanka.

Hawking joins the stars
	
A decade to two ago, when I was travelling widely across the island on my motorcycle, I used to take a few books with me to read at night. Inside my backpack, there would always be a copy of Carl Sagans Cosmos and Stephen Hawkings A Brief History of Time. 
There was always little time to read, arriving at night as I did pretty tired by a days riding and visits, and looking forward to a good nights sleep before starting out early again the next day. At best, Id manage to read a few pages. Looking out of the window, the night sky would be brilliantly lit by stars, but they were a confusing mass to a layman. These two books helped me to get the big picture with some clarity. They strengthened my belief that there are other worlds out there beyond our galaxy, with the possibility of intelligent life. It made you feel less lonely with only crickets for company when the lights were switched off. 
Cosmos was always, and still is, easier to read and understand. It must have been written for people like me, with elementary science, in mind. Sagan was already dead, at the relatively young age of 62, when I bought a copy of Cosmos. I dreamed of meeting Dr. Hawking one day. But he died two weeks ago, at age 76. The miracle is that he lived so long. 
In 1963, when doctors diagnosed him with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as Lou Gehrigs Disease) just after his 21st birthday, he was given less than three years to live. It gradually degenerated all his muscles and, after 1980, he had to be cared for by nurses. In 1981, when he contracted pneumonia, doctors wanted to remove his life support, but his wife Jane Wilde refused. He survived, but could not speak thereafter. 
During the final three decades of his life, he was confined to a wheelchair, and could only speak through a speech synthesizer activated by laser beams directed at his eye balls. Nevertheless, he took part in a zero-gravity flight and experienced weightlessness at age 65, married twice with three children, became the best known Cambridge University physicist of the 20th century, and a best-selling author who visited every continent while producing some of the most important cosmological research of our time about gravity and the properties of black holes. 
Its mind boggling. After meeting so many arrogant, self-important and humourless people in academia, administration, politics and business during my life, people who have all their limbs and faculties in working order but producing so much less, I marveled at the willpower, tenacity and productivity of this man, entirely at the mercy of the nurse who fed him and brushed his teeth daily, and yet was able to move millions with his words and writing. His body was a trap, and it was a condition which would have destroyed any ordinary mind. But this was no ordinary mind. 
Even on my darkest days and hours, that inspired me to keep going, and to keep working.  As far as known, he never complained about being trapped inside an inanimate body, possibly because his mind wondering far and wide made him forget his physical existence. His only complaint about his speech synthesizer, custom-made for him in California, was that it gave him an American accent. 

Dr. Hawking liked to note that he was born 300 years to the day after the death of Galileo, who initiated the study of gravity. He was a mediocre student at school but at Oxford, he rarely needed to take notes while studying mathematics
Dr. Hawking liked to note that he was born 300 years to the day after the death of Galileo, who initiated the study of gravity. He was a mediocre student at school but at Oxford, he rarely needed to take notes while studying mathematics, and got by with a thousand hours of work in three years, averaging one hour a day. People have the mistaken impression that mathematics is just equations, he once said. In fact, equations are just the boring part of mathematics. 
Cosmology was the only subject which excited him, he said, because it dealt with the big question: Where did the universe come from His initial writing shows a strong religious streak. In A Brief History of Time, he refers to the mind of God. But he grew increasingly pessimistic about religion, saying in 2011: I regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark. 
In 1990, he separated from his wife Jane after 25 years of marriage, and married Elaine Mason, a nurse who had cared for him since his almost fatal bout of pneumonia. She was earlier married to David Mason, the engineer who had attached Dr. Hawkings speech synthesizer to his wheelchair. This second marriage was unsuccessful and they later divorced. 
He wrote A Brief History of Time because he wished to share his excitement about the discoveries that have been made about the universe with the public who paid for the research. He hoped, too, to earn enough to pay for his childrens education, and that wish came true when the book became a bestseller. 
Asked by the New Scientist magazine what he thought about most, he said: Women. They are a complete mystery.

Iran tells Trump he would regret dropping nuclear deal
	

REUTERS, 09th APRIL, 2018- Donald Trump will regret it if he pulls out of the nuclear deal with Iran, President Hassan Rouhani said on Monday, warning the U.S. president that Tehrans response would be stronger than he thinks.
U.S. sanctions that were lifted under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) of 2015 will resume unless Trump waives them again on May 12. Trump has effectively set that as a deadline for European powers to fix the terrible flaws of the deal.
The new U.S. president - who has big claims and many ups and downs in his words and actions - has been trying for 15 months to break the JCPOA ... but the structure of the JCPOA is so strong that it has not been shaken by such quakes, Rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on state television.

He was suspended following several complaints received by the Ministry by the devotees and the Kataragama Devalaya Management, Minister said.
Meanwhile, Dilruwan Rajapaksa was appointed as the Acting Basnayake Nilame for three months.
After the inquiry was held, if Nilame D. P. Kumarage cleared from the charges, he would be re-appointed, he said.
Meanwhile, the Minister ordered to record the daily collection generated from cash and gold of the Devalaya.
The decision was taken to set a good precedence to other Devalayas in the country, the Minister said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Many told me to accept PM's post, but I refused: Rajitha
	
Minister Rajitha Senaratne said today there were several requests to accept the prime ministerial post after the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was tabled in Parliament, but had refused to stab his leader in the back for the sake of high positions.
He said even LSSP leaders spoke to him secretly on this matter but refused to be enticed because he was used to obtaining positions up front and not through the back door.
At a ceremony held, at the Aluthgama Town Hall grounds, to distribute essential commodities to low-income families for the National New Year, the minister revealed that even Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had suggested that he be the common opposition candidate when the discussions were being held in 2014 to topple the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, but he had rejected it.
I explained to Mr. Wickremesinghe that it was best for then minister, Maithripala Sirisena to come forward as the common candidate and introduced him as our nominee for the presidential poll. The no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister was the handiwork of those who worked against Mr. Sirisena at the 2015 presidential election and had no say nor shared in the January 2015 victory. I played an independent role and as a result, I am being applauded by many, he said.
The minister said the government was in disarray after the February 10 LG polls.
"Our main responsibility is to fulfill the pledges given to the people in 2015. President Maithripala Sirisena accepted the leadership of the SLFP and formed a unity government after the August 2015 general elections. If he had declared a parliamentary election soon after the presidential election in 2015, the UNP would have without doubt recorded a major victory," he said. Soon after the SLFP was defeated, Basil went to the US. Former president was in Tangalle. We set up a yahapalana government with the two main political parties to bring prosperity to the country. We would have won the LG polls if we contested the poll as one unit. I told this to the president. However, we won the LG polls on the number of votes but lost on the number of wards."

NMCRP leads protest against Quadricycle-micro car
	
The National Movement for Consumer Rights Protection (NMCRP) and several civil society movement organizations today handed over a petition to the Indian High Commission against the attempt to import Quadricycle-micro car, which has been banned in India, into the country.
NMCRP Chairman Ranjith Withanage pointed out that the government attempting to ban an Indian made vehicle that had been banned in India by misusing their power. The number of deaths and injuries as a result of road accidents involving non-roadworthy vehicles in Sri Lanka is already on the rise. The import of this type of vehicle therefore would exacerbate the problem and result in more deaths, he said.
Due to concerns over Quadricycles safety aspects, in 2015 the Department of Motor Traffic (DMT) delayed granting approval to import the Bajaj Qute RE60 quadricycle.
It was learned that the DMT is to add a new vehicle category for quadricycle after permitting the import of the vehicle.
Bajaj Qute, the motorised four-wheel quadricycle vehicle, weighs less than 450kg and is said to be 37% lighter than the smallest car presently existing in the domestic market with a light 216.6 cc engine. The maximum speed stipulated for the vehicle is said to be 70 kmph.
The launch of the vehicle in India had been halted for three years due to legal action by rival companies, despite the government approving the new category of vehicles and the company will be reaching out to its overseas markets to avoid incurring losses.
According to the Economic Times, three-wheeler giant Bajaj Auto will be exporting its Quadricycle vehicle to its traditional export destinations like Sri Lanka, Egypt and Nigeria. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

People want non-traditional politicians - Gotabhaya Rajapaksa
	
Spells out what he would do in case he is picked as presidential candidate
	Explains what he would do regarding his US citizenship
	Emphasizes the need for strong leadership and political stability

We should not get involved in super power rivalries. As a small country, if we get involved in these rivalries, we would be in trouble.

Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, in an interview with the Daily mirror , spoke about his future plans and the way forward for the country. Excerpts:

QThere is a lot of talk about you being chosen as the presidential candidate. Has anyone actually approached you to be the candidate for the presidency
No. But, there is talk. I think there is enough time- one and half years- to decide on that. It depends on former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. He has to decide who the best candidate is. He knows who is the most suitable one who can win. 
QUnder the current circumstances, what do you feel about that role
The best person to be the candidate is none other than former President Rajapaksa. He is the person who has the public support, popularity and the leadership needed at this juncture. He has the experience. Unfortunately, he cannot contest for the presidency because of the 19th Amendment. Then, you have to find the next best person. Anyone who obtains his support will be able to win. 
Q In case, you are handpicked as the candidate are you ready to take up the challenge
If he thinks that I should contest, I have to come forward. I think I am capable of doing so. 
QYet, there is a barrier for you because you are dual citizen also having citizenship in the United States. How do you address this
Again, because of the 19th Amendment, I cannot contest as things are at the moment. Yet, if the former Presidents choice is me, I have to go through the process of renouncing dual citizenship. 
Q What is that process actually
It depends on me. There is a process. But, it is a very clear and short process. 
QApart from that, what is your opinion on the recent outbreak of communal violence in Kandy
If you browse the newspapers, you find incidents all over the country, not in Kandy alone. Murders, robberies are everywhere. There is a definite breakdown in the rule of law. I think that is the main reason. As for the Kandy incidents, there could have been quicker and faster actions taken to prevent them. As far as I know, the incident took place between two parties. There was one week gap until the first incident and the death of that person. I do not think that the Government took enough precautionary measures. When an incident of that nature takes place, anybody can anticipate that there could be reaction from the other side. They should have taken quick action to stop it. May be, the incident was not taken seriously. Or else, information about the incident had been sent to the relevant persons. I think there was a lapse on this regard. 
QSome people say the intelligence authorities failed to sense the impending danger. As the former Defence Secretary, what do you feel about it
They must be referring to the police intelligence. It is not the duty of other intelligence agencies to cover that area. But, we had a very good intelligence service previously. We were capable of handing similar situations. They had tackled more serious situations back then. If there had been a lapse on the part of the intelligence authorities, again, the Government is to blame. This Government was undermining the work of intelligence agencies. There were certain incidents taking place. The effect of the intelligence service has been undermined. That is the reason for the lethargy or the weakness on the part of the intelligence services. 
QSimilar violence broke out in Aluthgama and Beruwala during the time the last regime. You were accused of backing Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) that instigated the violence. How do you respond
That is not correct. If you look at the history, communal violence has been taking place for many years. What is more important is whether the Government concerned was able to respond to such incidents during such times. When the Aluthgama incident unfolded, we took immediate action and were able to control the situation. The Government had nothing to do with BBS. That was a myth created by the then opposition. I am not in anyway connected with BBS. Now, you can see things happening. You can see who is behind such organizations. 
The politicians are trying to take advantage by putting the blame on us. 
QYet, there was a failure on the part of the previous Government to take preemptive measures
You have to understand the position of the Government at that time. You cannot say that we did not take any preemptive action. Action you take has to be justified by the Government. You cannot just go and arrest people without a reason. We took many precautionary measures. We never encouraged people to do any of these things. 
I took a lot of action to control the situation. I had several meetings with different sections of the Muslim community. I met their clergy and business community. I met not only BBS priests, but also other eminent Buddhist monks. I brought both the parties to the table. It was not merely about taking legal action. There is something more to it. We discussed measures to take control of the situation and build an understanding between the communities. We had many discussions on this regard. 
QIn your view, what should be done to avoid the recurrence of such incidents in the future
You cannot explain it in one word. It is a matter of understanding among all the communities. You cannot put the blame on one community. If there is any reaction from the majority community, it is not that easy to instigate people to do something like this. There are elements on both sides, that are radical or extreme. The majority of the people of both communities are not extremists. The majority of the people of both communities dont have radical ideas. Both communities should understand the situation and not leave room for radical elements. I think the community leaders must take action to understand each other and to take advice from the religious and community leaders in areas where the minorities are concentrated. 
QDo you see that Sri Lanka is under the threat of international terrorism
What is happening in the world today is anyway affecting any country. Anybody can read what is happening all over the world thanks to the latest technology and social media. Something affecting another country can make an impact on Sri Lanka as well. The Government intelligence agencies should be conscious of this fact. I do not see this (The security factor). 
As for the Kandy incidents, there could have been quicker and faster actions taken to prevent them
	This Government was undermining the work of intelligence agencies
	We need to introduce legislation to protect Government servants
	I do not understand the difference between a good politician and a good administrator
	But, he (Mahinda Rajapaksa) conducted the war very efficiently because he was listening
Q Now, you are being seen as the presidential candidate by some in the country. People say that you are only an administrator, not a politician. How do you respond
I do not understand the difference between a good politician and a good administrator. A good politician is a person who is administering a country. 
QThey must be talking about party politics in the present sense
May be, I am not a politician. I have never been a politician. 
Q How would you fit into the shoes of a politician
That may be a very difficult situation for anybody. All over the world, there is a trend that traditional politicians are rejected. It looks like they are being rejected not only in Sri Lanka, but also in the UKL, France, the US, Germany etc. People want non-traditional politicians. People tend to select such nontraditional politicians. It is up to them, after becoming politicians, to get adjusted to that position. I do not understand the kind of special qualities other than what a leader has. What matters most is leadership qualities be it a politician, manager or a military officer. That is the main qualification. 
QWhat is the advice you were given by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is your brother
What I have learned from him is about leadership qualities. I have learned a lot from him. He is a team player. He listens to others. A person cannot be an expert in everything. One can be an expert in one thing, not in everything. To run a country, you have to listen to the people. You have to get advice from people. He is a person who is ready to do it. He is a good decision maker. Once he decides on something, he is very clear. For example, he is not a military man. But, he conducted the war very efficiently because he was listening. 

When listening to the speeches by powerful Government ministers, it is very clear that they are trying to stop certain people coming forward
QDo you fear that you would be incarcerated by the Government ahead of the Presidential Elections
That I do not know. When listening to the speeches by powerful Government ministers, it is very clear that they are trying to stop certain people coming forward. They took action to stop the former President coming forward. There is a lot of talk to strip him of his civic rights. They have a lot of cases against me and Mr. Basil Rajapaksa. By taking undemocratic action you cannot prevent people from selecting a person. If they think that they can cling on to power forever by doing so, it is not correct. 
In the world, there were powerful people who tried to remain in power forever. They failed. Ultimately, it is the peoples wish. If they prevent me or the former President, people would select another. They will always find a leader. This is still a democratic country. Nobody can go against the will of people. It is futile to take such action. 
Q If you become the President, what would you do to get the economy out its current mess
This is a very challenging thing for any leader. Whatever anyone might say in the Government, the Rajapaksa Government was able to end the war that prevailed for 30 years. We created an environment for the development of the country. We were lagging behind mainly because of the war. We took certain steps to develop the country. We were able to bring foreign investment. We started by developing infrastructure, roads and seaports. The new Government stopped development work, especially the ones launched with Chinese assistance. For some reason, the Port City project was held back for two and half years. They delayed the second phase of the Hambantota port Project. By stopping these development projects, the Government retarded the economic growth. The Government could not rectify it. 
It is challenging for the upcoming Government to rectify this situation. There are things you can do. First, there has to be political stability with strong leadership and investor confidence has to be instilled. During our time, we were able to bring a lot of investment to Sri Lanka- Shangri-La, TATA etc. When an investor comes, he should see a stable Government. You have to take quick action to solve their issues. That machinery is not in operation today. You have to create an environment to attract foreign investment. You have to encourage investors. Research and development is a key area this country needs. That project is not moving forward. There are many local entrepreneurs who can kick-start or drive the economy. 
You can learn a lot from countries such as Japan, China, Taiwan, Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore and South Korea. These countries had strong political leadership. Behind these leaders, there were local entrepreneurs and technocrats who developed the country. It is not merely the leaders only. We talk about Singapores Li Quan Yu, General Park in South Korea, Suharto in Indonesia and Deng Xiaoping in China. Behind these political leaders, there were technocrats who were responsible for the development of those countries. Now, the situation is different in the world. The low cost manufacturing economy is gone. We have to consider our areas of strength. We have to consider high skilled industries for the development of our economy. We have to use these knowledge-based industries. For that, we need to have a good industrial policy. It is very challenging. We have skilled people. We cannot be satisfied with low income and labour intensive industries. 
QThe other problem that was experienced during the latter half of the previous Government is Indias concerns about Chinese investments here. It was seen as the reason for Indias subtle moves to bring down that Government. Have you mended fence with India
That is a difficult thing to do while being in the opposition. The present Government fears that any other country, be it India or anyone, would speak to someone connected the previous Rajapaksa Government. It is very difficult to clarify these things. Everybody knows that there is a geopolitical situation in the region. Sri Lanka is positioned strategically in the Indian Ocean region though it is a small country. We know that China has emerged as an economic power. It is trying to become a military power as well. When China becomes a super power, they would have certain issues. They are keen on keeping open the sea-lanes in the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean is a very important region. India also shows interest in it. We must be neutral in this region in which many powers interested. We should not get involved in super power rivalries. As a small country, if we get involved in these rivalries, we would be in trouble. Ultimately the present Government has been involved in super power rivalries unnecessarily. That has also created difficulties for anybody to come. 
Though we received a lot of assistance from China, we never got them permanently involved here. We were conscious about what India was saying. Leasing out the Hambantota Port, it has created a grave situation. I am sure India is concerned about it. 
Also, leasing out the Mattala Airport and Trincomalee Seaport to India is an invitation for unnecessary trouble. Sri Lankas future leaders would have a difficult job as a result. 
QWhat are the other aspects you intend to rectify
There is another mistake done by the Government. They have inflicted fear in the Government service. Officials do not take decisions and implement them because of the fear they have for the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID). We need to introduce legislation to protectGovernment servants.

Police ask public to be vigilant during Danger Period
	
When considering the highest number of road-related fatalities reported every year April 10 to April 20 can be regarded as a danger period and as such police traffic control units request road users to be extra cautious at this time of the year.
The danger period between April 10 and 20 has already entered the record books with the highest number of 120 to 130 deaths from road accidents reported.
A senior traffic police officer told Daily Mirror the recent statistics had shown that at least 130 people had died countrywide in the past five years during the national festivities in April.
With the long festive holidays in April, people in great numbers begin to return home in the outstations or visit Nuwara Eliya and Kataragama, which have tourist and religious significance.
He said in the old days when there was lesser number of personal vehicles the people mostly used to travel by trains, buses or vans. But in recent times, small groups of family members especially among the lower income groups use three-wheelers to travel to distant destinations.
This is a risky mode of transport because these vehicles are usually overloaded with five to six including children from a single family using these modes of transport.
When small overcrowded vehicles travel long distances the hazards and risks too increase.
In 2017 some 3,100 road-related fatalities were reported countrywide and in the previous few years similar figures were reported, which is an 8% on an average.
However, during the so called danger period such fatalities on an average have been calculated at an alarming percentage of 12 to 13. The number of deaths reported in 2017 alone was 135.
Police statistics have shown the highest number of deaths involved pedestrians, motorcyclists, trishaw users and other commuters.
Therefore, the police request all road users to be extra cautious during the period which starts from today and to help law enforcement authorities to reduce the rate of traffic fatalities. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Post-no-faith motion: SLFP in a quandary
	
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has virtually split into two factions over the question of whether it should remain in the government in the aftermath of the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.
The sixteen SLFP ministers, deputy and state ministers who voted for the motion insisted, at Monday's SLFP Central Committee meeting, that they be allowed to quit the unity government with the United National Party (UNP).
Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa was the first to air his views on this matter and said the party should sever links with the government. He was followed by Minister S.B. Dissanayake and Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara who also endorsed these views.
However, according to reports the 25 SLFP ministers, deputy and state ministers who were absent during the vote on the no-confidence motion, were keen to remain in the government resulting in the SLFP being unable to take a final decision on the matter.
The CC will meet again tomorrow for further discussions. (Kelum Bandara)

## Title: REVIEW PETITION AGAINST JUDGES ORDER

REVIEW PETITION AGAINST JUDGES ORDER
	
In a unprecedented development in the Sri Lankan judicial system, attorneys representing the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) on March 13 (Tuesday), filed a review petition in the Supreme Court seeking an injunction against an order issued by a bench chaired by Acting Chief Justice Eva Wanasundera, blocking the prosecution of former Attorney General Mohan Peiris on charges of corruption.
According to the application filed by CIABOC against the presence of Justice Wanasundera on the bench that issued the order, documents furnished by the Hon. Attorney General and the relevant Minute demonstrate that Her Ladyship Justice Eva Wanasundera, PC, in her capacity as the then Attorney General had taken a decision related to the subject matter (including a decision relating to the question of whether or not to refer the matter to the CIABOC) and that Her Ladyship was also fully aware of the material/evidence in the possession of the Attorney Generals Department relating to the said allegation of corruption.
CIABOC, on January 18, 2018, filed a criminal case in the Colombo Magistrate Court against former Attorney General Mohan Peiris, former Deputy Solicitor General A.H.M.D. Nawaz and former Secretary, Ministry of Power and Energy M. M. C. Ferdinando based on a criminal complaint submitted to the Commission by the Attorney Generals Department.

It has thus become necessary for the Respondents-Petitioners to invoke the inherent powers of Your Lordships Court and/ or the powers of Review of Your Lordships Court to Review the Order issued on February 26, 2018 in this matter, in view of the extraordinary circumstances set out above

In the CIABOC application (Case No: 87741/01/18) submitted to the Colombo Magistrates Court, Peiris, Nawaz and Ferdinando have been accused of conspiring to commit and thereafter committing an act of corruption to bestow undue benefit to the officers of Lanka Electricity Company (Pvt) Ltd (LECO) by gross subversion of established practices in the Attorney Generals Department, in contravention of Section 113(b) of the Penal Code and Section 102 read with Section 70 of the Bribery Act.
Specifically, according to the CIABOC application to Court on January 18, 2018, while a CID investigation into allegations of financial crimes by LECO officers was ongoing under the supervision of State Counsel Thusith Mudalige of the Criminal Division of the

Although the CIABOC case against Peiris was filed in January, it was over a month later, in February, that CIABOC faced a coordinated onslaught of six Supreme Court petitions and writ applications seeking to block them from proceedings in the Magistrates Court. These cases were filed upon the departure
of Chief Justice Priyasath Dep

Attorney Generals Department, the accused are charged with knowingly bypassing the Criminal Division and soliciting and sending a corrupt legal opinion to a third party, M.M.C. Ferdinando, through then Civil Division Attorney A.H.M.D. Nawaz claiming that there was no criminal liability in respect of a fraudulent transaction, without any reference to the CID investigation or consultation with the criminal division attorneys handling the matter. In fact, it is alleged that no file was opened regarding this matter, and it was done solely to halt the CID investigation.
After the alleged criminal action had taken place and the CID was informed to halt the investigation, the CID had informed State Counsel Mudalige, who had taken up the matter with then Solicitor General Jayantha Jayasuriya, who is now the Attorney General. During an internal investigation that took place after Attorney General Peiris was elevated to the position of Chief Justice, CIABOC now charges that the file had reached the desk of Peiris successor as Attorney General, incumbent Supreme Court Justice Eva Wanasundera.


CIABOC Review Petition
According to the CIABOC review petition to the Supreme Court, Justice Wanasunderas involvement in this matter as Attorney General is evidenced by a minute signed by her in the investigation file on July 5, 2012, addressing the question whether a criminal complaint should be made to CIABOC over the actions of former Attorney General Peiris and over what disciplinary action was warranted.
The CIABOC complaint further states, As such, Her Ladyship Justice Eva Wanasundera, P.C. was obliged to have recused herself from participating in the matter.According to the complaint, the aforesaid presumption of bias and/or conflict of interest are aggravated by her failure to make full disclosure of the aforesaid facts, prior to taking up the matter.
Although the CIABOC case against Peiris was filed in January, it was over a month later, in February, that CIABOC faced a coordinated onslaught of six Supreme Court petitions and writ applications seeking to block them from proceedings in the Magistrates Court. These cases were filed upon the departure of Chief Justice Priyasath Dep on a foreign tour, when Justice Wanasundera, the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court, was appointed as Acting Chief Justice in his absence.
The cases consisted of four Writ Applications (Mohan Peiris SC Writ 22/ 2018, A.H.M.D. Nawaz SC Writ 23/2018, Kalyananda Tiranagama SC Writ 24/2018 and Udaya Rohan de Silva SC Writ 25/ 2018) and two Fundamental Right applications Kelum Darshana Kumarasinghe SC FR 70/ 2018 and S.A.D.S. Suraweera SC FR 66/ 2018) filed in terms of article 140 of the Constitution. Although it is the Court of Appeal that takes on Writ Applications, when a Writ is sought against a decision of the CIABOC under the Bribery Act, the jurisdiction to hear a Writ Application is transferred by law from the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court.
All six cases were scheduled to be taken up together on February 26 by a three-member bench chaired by Acting Chief Justice Wanasundera, including Justices Priyantha Jayawardena and Nalin Perera. It was only after the first case, a writ application filed by Mohan Peiris, was taken up and an injunction against CIABOC that restrained proceedings in the Magistrates Court was issued by the bench. It was then discovered that the Acting Chief Justice had an undisclosed conflict that CIABOC alleges bars her from hearing the case.
According to the petition filed by the Counsel on behalf of CIABOC, the Bench presided over by Her Ladyship Hon. Eva Wanasundara P.C., Acting Chief Justice individually took up the Writ Application by Mohan Peiris for support over the objections of several Counsel requesting that the connected matters, i.e. SC (Writ) 23/2018, SC (Writ) 24/ 2018, SC (Writ) 25/2018, SC (FR) 70/2018 be taken up together as their subject matter and implications were interconnected.

Corruption
The motion further states, Supreme Court Writ Application 22/ 2018 was filed on February 9, 2018 and was listed for support on February 26, 2018. The Attorney General informed the CIABOC that he was unable to appear for them. This was due to the fact that the Attorney Generals Department was the complainant with regard to the complaint of corruption allegedly committed by the petitioner Peter Mohan Maithri Peiris alias Mohan Peiris former Chief Justice, and fifth and sixth respondents- Abdul Hamid Mohamed Nawaz and M.M.C. Ferdinando respectively.
Thus the respondents-petitioners had limited time to retain private counsel for the matter which was to be supported on February 26, 2018. A Bench of Your Lordships Court presided over by Her Lordship Hon. Eva Wanasundara P.C., Acting Chief Justice, took up this matter for support despite several Counsel requesting that the connected matters, to be taken up together.
Upon this application being taken up, it was submitted in open court by Mr. Sanjaya Rajaratnam P.C. Senior Additional Solicitor General, appearing for the Hon. Attorney General, that Her Ladyship Hon. Eva Wanasundare PC during her tenure as Hon. Attorney general made certain minutes pertaining to facts and circumstances relevant to this subject matter in an official and confidential file of the Attorney generals Department which he referred to as a CF File.

CF File
Certain documents were handed over to Her Ladyship Hon. Eva Wanasundare PC Acting Chief Justice by Mr. Sanjaya Rajaratnam PC Senior Additional Solicitor General, which were said to be copies thereof. While those documents were retained by Her Ladyship, the content of same were not disclosed to the parties or counsel. Mr. Sanjaya Rajaratnam PC, who handed over the perusal a file said to be the said CF File to Her Ladyship which was later returned.Her Ladyship Eva Wanasundara PC Acting Chief Justice, without disclosing the content of the documents so handed over, or the nature of the minutes she has made, inquired from counsel appearing in SC (Writ) 22/ 2018, whether they had any objections to the Bench of Her Ladyship hearing the matter. Being unaware of the content or nature of the aforesaid documents handed over to Her Ladyship, all counsel indicated that they had no objection to the bench or Her Ladyship taking up the matter.Counsel for 1st to 4th respondents raised two preliminary objections namely; the petitioner has not acted uberrima fidei by not disclosing the letter of the 6th respondent dated December 2, 2010, and the annexures thereto (which are referred to P3(a) and the petitioner has failed to comply with Rules 3(1) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules of 1990.After hearing the submissions of all parties, Her Ladyship dictated the Order of Court issuing Notice and a stay order restraining proceedings in the Magistrates Court until the conclusion of the case. The aforesaid Order dated February 26, 2018 forms part of the Record in this matter, and in view of the Respondents-Petitioners being unable to obtain a copy of same, request permission to tender a copy of same, if so required by Your Lordships Court.

TWO Connected cases
Your Lordships Court did not rule of the preliminary objections raised by the counsel for 1st to 4th Respondents (Chairman, Commission Members and DG CIABOC respectively). After a short adjournment of the proceedings, two connected cases (SC Writ 23/2018 and SC Writ 25/2018) were taken up and several Counsel appearing for 1st to 4th Respondents adverted to a document filed by the Petitioner in SC Writ 23/2018 signed by Senior Presidents Counsel referring to Her Ladyship, as well as the fact that Her Ladyship was said to have made a minute related to this matter (though the nature of the content of that minute was unknown to them at that time), and therefore, raised the issue of propriety to Her Ladyship hearing the case.
Although those Counsel urged Court to record the submissions made by the Counsel, those matters as well as the other connected matters were adjourned for support for March 7, 2018, without recording the submission made by Counsel. Subsequently, the 1st to 4th Respondents requested the Hon. Attorney General to provide the copy of the relevant Minutes to the instant Respondents in as much as it may be relevant to the subject matter of this application and the criminal proceedings which form the subject matter of this application.



CIABOC, on January 18, 2018, filed a criminal case in the Colombo Magistrate Court against former Attorney General Mohan Peiris, former Deputy Solicitor General A.H.M.D. Nawaz and former Secretary, Ministry of Power and Energy M. M. C. Ferdinando based on a criminal complaint submitted to the Commission by the Attorney Generals Department

The Hon. Attorney General accordingly made available the said Minute and connected documents to the CIABOC. The documents furnished by the Hon. Attorney General and the relevant Minute demonstrate that Her Ladyship in her capacity as then Attorney General had taken a decision related to the subject matter of this application (including a decision relating to the question whether or not to refer the matter to the CIABOC). Her Ladyship was also fully aware of the material/ evidence in the possession of the Attorney Generals Department relating to the said allegation of corruption.


The relevent minutes contained in B1 states:
Thanks for the long report at bl. (3).
I am of the view that part 1 can be dealt with in CR1/368/10 file in the normal course of action re CR1 files in their department.
Part II: I agree with you on recommendation 2 against 2A in your report.
SSC/ Administration should move in the matter with the knowledge of the AG and initial disciplinary proceedings under the E code for having written the letter dated 16-12-2010.
Pl. do the needful.
Eva
5/7/12
Her Ladyship having knowledge of the aforesaid and especially having made a Minute relating to the aforesaid, merely inquired whether the parties in the instant

The motion further states, Supreme Court Writ Application 22/ 2018 was filed on February 9, 2018 and was listed for support on February 26, 2018. The Hon. Attorney General informed the CIABOC that he was unable to appear for them. This was due to the fact that the Hon. Attorney Generals Department was the complainant with regard to the complaint of corruption

application had any objections to Her Ladyship hearing the matter without making full disclose of the extent of her involvement with the file, in her capacity as Attorney General. In the aforesaid circumstances of the instant case, Respondents-Petitioners states that Her Ladyship was biased and/ or at minimum there was a strong and seeming appearance of bias and/or there was a conflict of interest in her participating in the matter.
As such, Her Ladyship was obliged to have recused herself from participating in the matter. The Respondents-Petitioners further state that the aforesaid presumption of bias and/ or conflict of interest are aggravated by her failure to make a full disclose of the aforesaid facts, prior to taking up the matter.
It has thus become necessary for the Respondents-Petitioners to invoke the inherent powers of Your Lordships Court and/ or the powers of Review of Your Lordships Court to Review the Order issued on February 26, 2018 in this matter, in view of the extraordinary circumstances set out above.
Grave and irremediable harm and damage will be caused unless the interim relief prayed for is granted by Your Lordships Court in as much as impugned order is tainted by bias/ conflict of interest as set out above. In all the circumstances mentioned above it has also become necessary to seek an appropriate order from Your Lordship the Chief Justice, considering the general and public importance of this matter, that a direction be made in terms of Article 132(3) of the Constitution constituting a Divisional Bench of Five or more Hon. Justices of the Supreme Court to consider this application and all matters connected therewith. The Respondents-Petitioners have not invoked the jurisdiction of Your Lordships Court with regard to the subject matter of the instant application.
CIABOC counsel have requested that the Supreme Court considering the general and public importance of this matter appoint a bench comprising five or more justices to consider the application and all connected matters, issue a stay order suspending the February 26, 2018 order that blocked the prosecution in the Magistrates Court, review and set aside that order, and grant such further and other relief as Your Lordships Court shall deem fit.


During an internal investigation that took place after Attorney General Peiris was elevated to the position of Chief Justice, CIABOC now charges that the file had reached the desk of Peiris successor as Attorney General, incumbent Supreme Court Justice Eva Wanasundera

These papers had been filed in courts and the case is scheduled to be taken up soon.

On the eve of the no confidence motion, a leading purohita in yahapalanaya along with his wife reportedly attended a lime-cutting ritual at a popular devalaya to dispel malefic influences afflicting him.
The purohita had spent about one hour participating in the Shanti-karma. Although some newsmen had come to the devalaya on hearing about his presence, the purohita had rushed back to Colombo giving them the miss.
The purohita is said to be under the strong belief that he is going through a bad spell these days, they say.

SLFP Ministers to boycott todays Cabinet meeting
	
The SLFP Central Committee met at Presidents official residence in Colombo last night and all SLFP ministers decided to boycott todays Cabinet meeting.
The decision was taken in protest against the UNP Ministers who were continuously insulting the SLFP ministers as well as the UNP demand for the SLFP MPs who voted in favour of the No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister to resign, a senior minister said.
Accordingly, as a courtesy, other SLFP Cabinet ministers will also boycott the todays cabinet meeting with the 16 Cabinet Ministers who voted in favour of the no-confidence motion.
Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa had proposed during the meeting that the SLFP ministers should quit the government and the proposal was seconded by Minister S.B. Dissanayake. The majority were later of the view that they should quit the government. A full report compiled by 16-Cabinet ministers was also submitted at the CC meeting last night.
At that time, the President has said that without rushing into any decision, a collective decision should be taken as a party and expressed the importance of taking collective decisions by all 41 SLFP MPs.
The SLFP Central Committee is to meet next Wednesday and take a decision on whether they would quit the government or not. (Ajantha Kumara Agalakada)

2500 students participate in Tsunami drills
	
As part of 90 tsunami drills held in 90 schools across 18 countries in Asia and the Pacific
Colombo, April 2018: The 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami claimed the lives of more than 35,000 Sri Lankans and affected more than one million people across the island. It damaged a total of 183 schools, 18 vocational and industrial training institutes and 4 universities, affecting the studies of nearly 100,000 students across fourteen coastal Districts.
To reduce the loss of lives associated with tsunamis, the Government of Japan is supporting a regional project to strengthen school preparedness for tsunamis in Asia and the Pacific. Implemented by UNDP in Country Offices across Asia and the Pacific region, 90 tsunami drills in 90 schools would be conducted across 18 countries including: Bangladesh, Cambodia, Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Thailand, Timor Leste, Tonga, Vanuatu, Vietnam and Sri Lanka.
In Sri Lanka, UNDP together with the Ministry of Disaster Management, Ministry of Education, Red Cross, Sri Lanka Navy and School Development Societies, will design, implement and coordinate a school simulation programme in five selected schools affected by the Tsunami in 2004. The first of these drills was held on April 03,at the Vidyaloka Madya Maha Vidyalaya in Galle with the participation of 2500 students.
Speaking about this initiative, UNDP Sri Lanka Deputy Country Director Ms. Lovita Ramguttee stated, The schools response and evacuation plans are a critical aspect of disaster preparedness. We must learn from the past, and continue to build awareness and preparedness of both local communities and schools. I am grateful that with the support from the Government of Japan, school children in Sri Lanka will join others across the Asia Pacific region in learning how to remain safe during natural disasters.
Addressing the impact of the drills, the Principal of the Vidyaloka Madya Maha Vidyalaya school in Galle, Mr. P.P.W. Senevirathna stated We are pleased to be part of this first drill. We hope that we can take the learnings from this drill and guide other schools in the Galle District.
School Preparedness programme is a full operational drill to test and evaluate the operational and decision-making readiness of Principals, staff, students and school committees in the event of a tsunami affecting Sri Lanka.
The exercise allows these schools to simulate on how to evacuate the students properly to identified safe locations as well as to simulate on Schools Disaster Management Plan developed.
Speaking on the role of the Ministry of Disaster Management, Additional Secretary and Director General of Disaster Management Centre (DMC), Dr. Amalanadan, stated, The Ministry and the DMCis deeply committed to reduce the impact of disasters. Todays awareness programme for over 2500 students and 100 teachers, helps them to be aware and stay prepared in the event of a tsunami.
The regional project will contribute to the achievement of the Sendai Frameworks targets to reduce lives lost, numbers of people affected, and economic damage from natural and human-induced hazards. It also aims to achieve UNDPs goal to help vulnerable regions to adapt to climate change by integrating disaster risk measures into national strategies.
The next Drill is scheduled for May.

90th Birth Anniversary of late Dr. A.C.S. Hameed
	
Sri Lankan Foreign Affairs Minister A. C. S. Hameed (second right) and wife (extreme left) arrive at the Singapore airport. They were greeted by Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Lee Khoon Choy (third right).

Minister Dr. A.C.S. Hameed, the first Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka was born on a day like today in 1928.(10/04/1928) 
He studied at St. Anthonys College, Katugastota, Vijaya College and Zahira College in Matale. 
He entered into UNP politics in 1956. He was elected to Parliament in 1960 General Election. He became the Member of Parliament in 1960 General Election. He won seven General elections consecutively and was an undefeated character until his demise in 1999. In 1977 General election, he was appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Once he was referred Sinhala Hameed as he was elected by the people of Harispattuwa Constituency, with the support of majority of Sinhala Buddhists. During election periods he used to go to each and every village to meet his voters. On one such occasion he met an old woman during a visit. He stopped his walking and asked this old woman Aachchi, to whom are you going to give your vote this time She could not make him out at once due to her weak eyesight. Immediately she replied, to whom else except that Thambi. Then Hameed said Aachchi, I am that Thambi. This illustrates how Sinhalese people treated him without thinking twice about his race or religion. Always he was with them. During his period most of the people who got employment were Sinhalese people. 
He was a prominent figure in J.R.s government and held the portfolio of Foreign Affairs 12 years consecutively and after serving in different portfolios he was offered the Foreign Minister post for a few years under President D.B. Wijetunga. He held the portfolios of Justice and Higher Education Ministries under the Premadasa Administration. He served the people of Harispattuwa ignoring racial differences and helped the temples of the area in various ways. 

He was also given much prominence in the media. He was also pleased when cartoons about him appeared in newspapers. He even had get-togethers with a number of cartoonists.
When the Buddhist Monks come to meet him in the Ministry of Foreign Afffairs, Colombo he never forgot to give transport to them to go to the Pettah Bus Stand. I had arranged transport for them on numerous occasions on the instructions of Dr. Hameed . He was a genuine gentleman in all respects. 
During his tenure of service, he settled many disputes which other mediators could not do properly. Doctors Strikes and University students unrest are among them. Once he mediated the dispute which the Sinhalese and Muslims had in Galle and settled it without any problem. He also settled the incident of hijacking of the Al-Italiya flight by Sepala Ekanayake. 
During his period as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, many job opportunities were provided to Sri Lankans in Middle-Eastern countries and many Sri Lanka Embassies were established in various countries, specially in the Middle-East region. 
He was also given much prominence in the media. He was also pleased when cartoons about him appeared in newspapers. He even had get-togethers with a number of cartoonists. Though he had a busy schedule, he has published several books authored by him. He has been awarded Doctorates by the University of Korea and the University of Sri Jayawardenapura. 
According to my view, he was the most successful Foreign Minister appointed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs so far. 
He is a most sought after character in the present context to bring racial harmony in Sri Lanka today. During the LTTE period, he went to Jaffna, for negotiations with LTTEleader Prabakaran. 
This is a tribute to his yeomen service rendered to Sri Lanka during his tenure of service.

TNAs key role in defeating no-confidence motion against Ranil
	

By
D.B.S. Jeyaraj

In the seven-decade long history of Independent Sri Lankas legislature, there have been two no-confidence motions and related debates that are unprecedented and unparalleled. The first was in 1981 when members of the then United National Party (UNP) government brought and passed a no-confidence motion against the former leader of the opposition, Appapillai Amirthalingam. The no-confidence motion (NCM) brought against the late Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) leader was farcically unique in the sense that members of the ruling party were sponsoring a no-confidence motion against the leader of the opposition. 
The second such controversial no-confidence motion was the recent NCM brought against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his government by members of the opposition and sections of the same government headed by the PM. The tragicomic aspect of this NCM was the fact that ministers were supporting a NCM against Wickremesinghe and government while serving in the same government under the Prime Minister. It was indeed amusingly saddening to witness the covert moves by President Sirisena to undermine and topple his own govt of which Wickremesinghe was premier. Now the situation has been made even more facetious by the ministers who voted against the Prime minister stubbornly clinging to their ministerial portfolios without having the basic self-respect or decency of resigning their posts 
Interestingly both these no-confidence motions were introduced on the only two occasions when Sri Lankan Tamils were serving as leaders of the opposition in Parliament. Appapillai Amirthalingam was opposition leader from 1977 to 1983. Current opposition leader Rajavarothiam Sampanthan has been holding office since 2015. When the 1981 NCM targeted the leader of the opposition, Amirthalingam and his fellow TULF Parliamentarians walked out and did not participate in the one -sided rowdy debate in which elected MPs threatened Amirthalingam with torture and terrible methods of execution supposedly practised by Sinhala kings of yore. 
The 2018 NCM was different from 1981 in the sense that it was aimed at the prime minister and not opposition leader. However the leader of the opposition Sampanthan departed from tradition by criticising the NCM and supporting the Prime Minister. All 16 MPs who were elected in 2015 on the ITAKs house symbol on behalf of the TNA voted against the NCM.They played a crucial role in ensuring defeat of the attempt to topple the prime minister. 

Apart from plans of a no-confidence motion against opposition leader Sampanthan, a campaign has also been launched against a purported agreement between the Prime Minister and the Tamil National Alliance
In the final count 122 votes were cast in support of Ranil Wickremesinghe against the no-confidence motion. 76 MPs supported the motion while 26 MPs absented themselves from the House during voting time. The NCM was defeated by 46 votes. The UNP, TNA, SLMC, AIMC,TPA and EPDP voted in support of Ranil while the joint opposition, JVP and sections of the SLFP voted against the premier. It could be seen therefore that even if the TNA votes were not taken into account the NCM would still have been defeated with a reduced lead by perhaps 107 to 76. 
Assessing in arithmetic terms
This however is only in terms of arithmetic. It would be erroneous to assess the role played by the TNA in arithmetical terms alone. Politics is not a numbers game always. As Leon Trotsky observed, Politics is more like algebra than like elementary arithmetic, and still more like higher rather than elementary mathematics In this instance too, assumptions of arithmetic or numbers based on the TNA votes in Parliament could be proved wrong. 
The TNA effect on the no-confidence motion exercise was far in excess of its number of MPs. It was more of a qualitative than quantitative nature. It could be argued to a reasonable extent that the weight of TNA support helped tilt the scales in favour of Wickremesinghe in a manner that belies the actual 15 it had. That is why the ire and wrath of the NCM proponents have turned against the TNA in the aftermath of the vote.Crude attempts are being made to communalise the issue by racist elements supportive of a Rajapaksa return to power. Some hawkish elements are trying to spread a canard that the LTTE and pro-LTTE elements in the Diaspora got the TNA to support Ranil because he was going to give the tigers a separate state through a federal constitution. A mind boggling assertion but the tragedy in Sri Lanka is that there are people ready to believe even the worst form of blatant lies. A prime example being the Wanda Pethi allegation in Ampara. 
Anyone with a modicum of genuine understanding about contemporary Tamil politics would laugh off these tragicomic allegations. If the LTTE led by Velupillai Prabhakaran had ever thought of federalism or devolution as being equal to a separate state the tigers would have accepted devolution so long ago. They did not and perceived devolution and federalism as a betrayal of the Tamil struggle for separation. They treated all Tamil politicians who strove for a political settlement with maximum devolution as traitors and killed them as in the case of Constitutional expert Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam. 
The LTTE is no more in Sri Lanka after May 2009, but the overseas structure of the LTTE remains though weakened and divided. The Diaspora tigers too continue with the same policies though they are unable to execute them on Sri Lankan soil. But the practice adopted now is to obstruct and sabotage any attempt to achieve a negotiated political settlement and usher in normalcy. The overseas tigers are strongly opposed to the current constitution making exercise. That is why they display venomous hatred towards Sampanthan and Sumanthiran who are fully supportive of and immersed in the Constitutional exercise. The tigerish elements also hate Ranil Wickremesinghe and Chandrika Kumaratunga because both leaders had tried to achieve a negotiated political settlement.The LTTE also knows that it is Ranil Wickremesinghe who is cooperating fully in the Constitutional exercise. 
Collapse of Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Govt.
Besides what the overseas tigers would like to do is to destabilise Sri Lanka if possible and cause political confusion. The best way for that is to ensure the collapse of the Sirisena -Wickremesinghe Govt. They would prefer to let the no-confidence motion succeed and result in the unseating of Wickremesinghe. If that had happened there would have been utter confusion and chaos. 
If the overseas tigers did possess some leverage in Tamil politics they would have ensured that the TNA either voted for the NCM or abstained. In fact many of the Tiger media organs are somewhat critical of the TNA for supporting Wickremesinghe in the current context. Some even say Ranil weakened the LTTE through his 2002 ceasefire and therefore should have been toppled as revenge. Against this backdrop of prevailing political reality, only a naive idiot or diabolical charlatan would advance the argument that the Diaspora tigers got the TNA to support Ranil to achieve separatism through the envisaged Constitution. 
What is happening now is that the TNA is being turned into a political target.Thwarted in their project of toppling the Prime Minister the so called joint opposition and their fellow travellers in the SLFP are trying to make a scapegoat of the TNA and directing their anger towards it. Latest media reports say that preparations are being made to sponsor a vote of no-confidence against the leader of the opposition and TNA parliamentary group leader Rajavarothiam Sampanthan. Unlike in 1981 where government MPs expressed their lack of faith in the leader of the opposition, this envisaged NCM against the opposition leader in 2018 is likely to be presented by the joint opposition with the support of SLFP elements. 
If saner counsel does not prevail and the NCM against Sampanthan is put to the vote we may very well witness another political absurd drama where the Prime Minister and bulk of the Govt are likely to repay Sampanthan by voting against the joint opposition motion. If these events do take place then Rajavarothiam Sampanthan and Ranil Wickremesinghe would go down in Parliamentary history as the leader of the opposition who safeguarded the Prime Minister of the Ruling Govt and the Prime Minister who protected his leader of the opposition. 
Purported UNP-TNA Agreement
Apart from plans of a no-confidence motion against opposition leader Sampanthan, a campaign has also been launched against a purported agreement between the Prime Minister and the Tamil National Alliance. It is being propagated that the alleged agreement between the UNP and TNA is a sell-out of the Sinhalese and a betrayal of the country. While Ranil is being depicted as a Judas who made a 30 pieces of Silver deal to safeguard his Prime Ministerial position,the TNA is being portrayed as a latter day Shylock who ruthlessly exploited the governments weakness and extracted huge concessions harmful to the countrys unity. 
There are two salient factors to consider in the accusations about a UNP-TNA deal. The media reports appearing in English and Tamil media outline the 10 to 12 points agreed upon in the alleged UNP-TNA agreement. None of those could in any way be regarded as a betrayal or sell-out or be seen as rapacious extractions of a sordid bargain. Secondly neither Ranil Wickremesinghe nor the TNA have made any effort to conceal anything from the public about this so called treachery. In fact the speeches made by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe ,Finance Minister Samaraweera and TNA spokesman Sumanthiran in Parliament refer indirectly to matters discussed between both parties and potential solutions. 
What then was the extent and impact of the key role played by the Tamil National Alliance in helping beleaguered Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to defeat the no-confidence motion Why did the TNA extend support to Wickremesinghe despite the opposition to such a move within party folds as well as sections of the Tamil polity  Was there a secret deal between the UNP and TNA over the NCM matter and if so what were the provisions of that agreement This article proposes to answer these questions to a reasonable extent. 
When the contours of a no-confidence motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe began evolving, there was some confusion initially.There was an impression that the NCM was being mooted by influential segments of the UNP itself and that Ranil faced a lot of resentment within the green elephant kraal. Moreover it was a fact that President Sirisena did not want Ranil Wickremesinghe as his prime minister and wanted to oust him. But few ever suspected that Maithripala would go to the extent of collaborating with the Rajapaksas and engineer a conspiracy to dislodge Ranil the man who helped make him President in his electoral tussle with Mahinda Rajapaksa. 
NCM against PM a tripartite plot
Once it became apparent that the proposed NCM against the Prime Minister was a tripartite plot hatched by anti-UNP elements, sections of the SLFP led by Sirisena and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) of which Mahinda Rajapaksa was the unofficial leader, the TNA hierarchy began to get perturbed. These sentiments got further exacerbated when percolating media reports speculated that Sirisena was having plans of replacing Ranil with Karu Jayasuriya as a stop gap measure, bring in ex - Defence secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to Parliament on the National list and then replace Karu with Gota as premier. The spectacle of Sirisena re-aligning with Mahinda Rajapaksa by itself was pathetic but the possibility of an emerging President - Prime Minister partnership between Maithripala and Gotabhaya was totally unpalatable. Apart from terminating the Constitution reform process such an axis would result in the country regressing backwards and negate the limited progress achieved since 2015. 
Trincomalee district MP and leader of the opposition Rajavarothiam Sampanthan is the senior most Tamil leader in Parliament today. Born in February 1933 the 85 year old TNA leader has participated in almost every meaningful attempt to bring about a negotiated settlement to the Tamil national question over the past 40 years since 1977. Currently he has fully involved himself with the Constitutional assembly and the formulation of a new constitution. He has dedicated himself to the task of achieving political equality for Tamils on the Island through this envisaged constitution. Sampanthan has hitched the TNA wagon to the new Constitution star and would very much like to attain his political objectives in the near future. Being an octogenarian he knows that the sands of time are running out. 
Sampanthan realises and recognizes that among the active frontline Sinhala political leaders only Ranil Wickremesinghe (not counting the retired Chandrika Kumaratunga) has shown some keen interest in bringing about a lasting settlement of the Tamil national question through a new Constitution providing adequate power sharing. Ranil knows that it is the only way out. Wickremesinghe assumes this position not because he is emotionally committed towards greater devolution like Chandrika Kumaratunga or Dr.Jayampathy Wickramaratne. Ranils commitment is more intellectual or practical. Wickremesinghe is a neo-liberal with a technocratic temperament. His primary goal is to modernise Sri Lanka and uplift the economy. However he realises that this cannot be done well as long as the ethnic wound festers. Ranil would therefore like to bring about a satisfactory resolution of the Tamil question through acceptable power sharing arrangements in a new Constitution.
There was no alternative to Ranil
This then makes Ranil Wickremesinghe indispensable to Sampanthans vision and political goals. There is a convergence if not an identity of interests. In recent times the TNA leader has been somewhat miffed with Ranil for the tardy progress on the Constitutional front ever since the interim report of the steering committee was released. These feelings however pale into insignificance when faced with the prospect of Ranil being toppled and possibly replaced. In spite of all his shortcomings and faults, Ranil Wickremesinghe remains the best choice of what is available for the minority communities in general and Sri Lankan Tamils in particular. Hence for TNA leaders like Sampanthan and Maavai Senathirajah it was a case of Hobsons choice.There was no alternative to Ranil whose unseating was certain to paralyse the political quest of a new power-sharing Constitution. 
There was another reason also for the TNA to support Ranil. The TNA has been closely associating with India and other influential western nations like the USA, Britain,Canada and Norway to help bring about a political settlement and ethnic reconciliation in Sri Lanka. Most of these nations were also of the view that it was politically important and imperative to ensure the continuation of Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister. The perceived somersaults of President Sirisena in trying to re-align with the Rajapaksas has jarred and jolted the international community which now regards Ranil as the sheet anchor of the present Govt. Replacing Ranil with another - least of all a member of the Rajapaksa clan - was not to be countenanced. The TNA being on the same political wavelength concurred with this perspective.

The TNA has been closely associating with India and other influential western nations like the USA, Britain,Canada and Norway to help bring about a political settlement and ethnic reconciliation in Sri Lanka

There were however some hitches. One of the TNA constituents the EPRLF had pulled out of the configuration prior to the local government elections and had contested against the TNA in the polls. Of the two EPRLF MPs, Dr. Sivamohan remained with the TNA but Sivasakthy Ananthan was out of the TNA and kept away from the TNA parliamentary group. Thus the TNA which had 16 MPs earlier had been reduced to 15. The EPRLF said it would arrive at its own decision after discussing with Wickremesinghe. The other TNA constituent was the TELO which also had two MPs. The TELO met separately and decided that it would abstain from voting. The third TNA constituent PLOTEs position was also uncertain and unknown as the leader Dharmalingam Siddarthan was undergoing the traditional period of mourning after the death of his mother. Mrs. Dharmalingam was the widow of former ITAK and TULF MP for Uduvil and Manipay V. Dharmalingam. The much respected, left-leaning Dharmalingam who served as MP from 1960 to 1983 was killed by the TELO along with Ex - MP Alalasundaram in 1985. 
Serious differences in opinion
Speculative reports also began appearing in sections of the Tamil media that there were serious differences of opinion among TNA parliamentarians about supporting Wickremesinghe.Although the TNA leadership had taken a policy decision in late March to oppose the no-confidence motion , it appeared that there was no unanimity among MPs. The TNA was apparently divided on this and the chances of a bloc vote being delivered in support of Ranil seemed to be slim if not remote. This made the TNA somewhat apprehensive on the question and when the media tried to find out what the party position on the NCM was a definite answer was not forthcoming. The question was evaded with the announcement that the TNA would decide on its stance on the eve of the NCM vote. 
It was against this backdrop that 13 MPs of the TNA met on the morning of April 3rd in Colombo. Not all members of the TNA parliamentary group were favourable to the idea of supporting Wickremesinghe. Some felt that the TNA should not interfere in what was essentially an intra-Sinhala dispute. They opined that the TNA should abstain from voting. Others of a more pro-tiger disposition wanted to keep away from voting so that Ranil would suffer his comeuppance, A few were of the view that Ranil was certainly going to lose with or without TNA support and therefore it would be better to not vote against and lose out in the end. Interestingly none of the TNA parliamentarians wanted to support the no-confidence motion against Wickremesinghe. They only wanted the TNA to abstain and not support Ranil. Voting for the NCM was firmly ruled out. 
TNA leader Sampanthan however took a different view and expounded it powerfully. He told the MPs how important it was for Ranil to remain as Prime Minister for resolving the ethnic problem and that his removal may result in the return of the Rajapaksas. The possibility of a Rajapaksa return had a dampening effect on many of the TNA MPs. Still there were some misgivings and fiery exchanges of words. Among those dissenting initially were MPs Selvam Adaikkalanathan, Iruthayaraj Charles Nirmalanathan, S. Shritharan and E. Saravanapavan. MPs Senathirajah and Sumanthiran endorsed Sampanthans position and argued in favour of supporting Ranil. The discussions were rather heated at times and at one point Shritharan pointed out to Sampanthan in an insulting manner that he had got more votes in Kilinochchi than Sampanthan in Trincomalee. 
Finally the inner -party discussions ended with all MPs agreeing that the TNA should support the PM by voting against the NCM. However some MPs now felt that they should extract some concessions from the Prime Minister in return for supporting him. It was pointed out that the UNP Jaffna MP Ms. Vijayakala Maheswaran and some UNP organizers had been given a quota in job appointments whereby they were able to provide employment to their supporters. Some TNA MPs wanted to demand such quotas from the PM. 
Principled position based on higher deals
A visibly angry Sampanthan rejected this suggestion saying he would not subscribe to this course of action. He said the TNA position on this was that the present Govt under this Prime minister should continue in order to implement the democratization and Constitution making process. Several other MPs including Senathirajah and Sumanthiran also rejected this suggestion saying this amounted to asking for political patronage. Sampanthan pointed out that the TNA was taking a principled position based on higher ideals and should not stoop down to the level of exchanging votes for jobs. This viewpoint was accepted with a compromise. It was suggested that the TNA parliamentarians should meet the Prime Minister directly and inform him of their decision to support him. However they would air their grievances about the slow progress in constitution making, release of Tamil detenues, return of lands and other issues to Wickremesinghe and seek a guarantee that he would provide redress. 
A delegation of TNA parliamentarians led by Sampanthan therefore called upon Wickremesinghe and explained the position. The MPs outlined their grievances and sought a guarantee from Wickremesinghe that he would address them in due course. Most of the matters raised were not new with some being issues of discussion from the time this Govt came into being. A common thread in the grievances was the lack of speed and not enough being done to address concerns. The issues raised were categorised into ten main points. They were as follows - 
1. Expediting the political discussions to bring about a negotiated settlement 
2. Renewing the dormant Constitution making process to enact a new Constitution 
3. Hastening the return of lands in the North-east occupied by the armed forces back to the civilian owners 
4. Speedy release of all Tamil political detenues 
5. Tracing the whereabouts of Missing persons and those made to disappear during the war 
6. Greater employment opportunities for youths in the North and East 
7. Giving preference to people already resident in the areas over non-residents when making government service appointments in the North and East 
8. Appointment of Tamil-speaking administrators in Tamil-speaking divisions in the North and East 
9. Prioritising development projects being undertaken by the Northern and Eastern provincial councils 
10. Giving top consideration to proposals made by MPs of the North and East when launching development projects in those areas 
Understanding reached without a formal agreement
As stated earlier there was nothing new or problematic in these proposals and the Prime Minister had no difficulty in agreeing to them. The ten categories of issues discussed were itemised into twelve points and put on paper. Two of the points raised had been broken up into two thereby increasing the number to twelve. Ranil Wickremesinghe placed his signature along with a few lines indicating that he had taken due note of the points mentioned and that he would guarantee speedy implementation of those proposals.
He said that he would refer to them in his parliamentary speech and also asked Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera who was present to elaborate more on the issues raised in his speech. Samaraweera consented. Thereafter a satisfied TNA departed having reached an understanding with the Prime minister and obtaining assurances without entering into any formal pact or forging a UNP- TNA agreement. 

However the TNA felt that as a matter of courtesy they should inform President Sirisena also of their decision to vote against the no-confidence motion. TNA leader Sampanthan and deputy leader Senathirajah sought an appointment and met with President Sirisena. They told the President that the TNA wanted the present government to continue with the same Prime Minister for the 2015 Mandate to be implemented and promises fulfilled. Sirisena was non committal. After informing the president about the NCM the TNA leaders also complained about irregular land settlement practices under the Mahaweli development scheme in Mullaitivu district. Sirisena who is the Mahaweli development minister promised to look into the problem and resolve it. 
What the TNA did not know at the time they met the President was that Maithripala Sirisena had earlier reacted strongly against the notion of TNA supporting Wickremesinghe against the NCM. When a UNP delegation had called on him, President Sirisena had said that if the NCM were to be defeated with the help of TNA votes it would not go down well with the Sinhala people. Minister Mangala Samaraweera had then retorted by asking Sirisena why it was wrong to get TNA votes in Parliament against the NCM when Sirisena had obtained millions of Tamil votes mobilised by the TNA to win the Presidential contest against Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2015. The president was silent. Later in Parliament the TNAs MA Sumanthiran was to refer to this incident in his speech but there has been no response from the President so far.

D-day dawned on April 4th. All 15 TNA parliamentarians including the bereaved Siddarthan met in the morning where Sumanthiran read out once again the 12 points discussed with Prime Minister Wickremesinghe in English and translated them into Tamil for the record. All MPs then pledged that they would vote against the no-confidence motion. TELO leader Selvam Adaikkalanathan noted that the TELO would vote against the NCM though his party central committee had unanimously decided to abstain. When Parliament commenced Sampanthan outlined the TNA position succinctly in his speech and emphasised why the party was voting against the NCM. 
Sampanthans succinct speech in Parliament
Leader of the opposition Sampanthan stated as follows - 
We are debating a Motion of No-Confidence against no less a person than the PM, and the Motion substantially deals with the question of corruption. Corruption has been the worst disease that has afflicted our country. There was a time when there was no complaint of corruption. But, in recent years, corruption has been the worst disease. The roots of corruption must be eradicated, and I think there is a general agreement that politicians, probably, constitute the roots of corruption. I think that needs to be addressed and eradicated 

The Tamil people have for long been estranged from the Sri Lankan mainstream. They are now slowly and surely coming in from the cold of political wilderness and entering Sri Lankas public life again.
With regard to the CB Bond scam, consequent to investigations, two persons are presently in custody. There has been a warrant issued against another person and investigations are proceeding. No one should be spared 
The question must be raised as to why the wording is so vague, lacking in any specific charge against the PM, with regard to the fraud pertaining to the Bond scam per se. Why should this NCM be brought now, at this point of time, is another question that I would like to pose to the House. I want to pose the question whether this NCM against the PM is the first step in a plan to bring down totally and completely, the present Government. President Maithripala Sirisena and PM Ranil Wickremesinghe were elected on a certain mandate. What was that mandate Firstly, the resolution of the national question which has plagued this country for the past 70 years. A part of the mandate granted was to uphold democracy in this country and avert this country from moving towards totalitarianism and dictatorship. The President and the PM were elected on the democratic verdict of the people, for certain fixed periods of time, under the Constitution 
In the interests of this country, in the interests of all the people in this country, in working together with the two main political parties, we would like all of us to come together 
Minority ethnicities solidly behind Ranil
At voting time all 16 MPs elected from the TNA in 2015 voted against the NCM. This included the EPRLFs Sivasakthy Anandan also. The motion was defeated by 46 votes. The voting once again revealed that the minority ethnicities of the Island were solidly behind Ranil Wickremesinghe. The majority of Tamil and Muslim MPs voted against the no-confidence motion. About seven Tamil and Muslim MPs absented themselves at voting time. What is important however is to note that no Tamil or Muslim MP (except Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle) voted for the no-confidence motion against Ranil. Even SLFP Wani district MP Cader Masthan who had signed the NCM earlier kept away from the House at voting time. 
The Tamil National Alliance can take justifiable pride in voting against the no-confidence motion. It was the TNA decision that removed uncertainty and tilted the decision in the Premiers favour. It was after the TNA decision that President Sirisena realising the NCM battle was lost backed out and asked the SLFP to abstain from voting. It was the TNA decision that thwarted the conspiracy within UNP ranks to vote against their leader. It was also the TNA decision that convinced the fence sitters among Muslim parties to decide firmly on voting against the NCM instead of abstaining. Once it became known that the TNA was firmly behind Wickremesinghe, it was obvious that the NCM would be defeated and this impacted on the voting stances of undecided parties and MPs. Also it was the TNA support which helped Ranil Wickremesinghe greatly to exceed the magic number of 113 by nine more votes. 
It remains to be seen whether Ranil Wickremesinghe would be able to function as an effective prime minister in the future despite proving he has the confidence of the majority in Parliament. It is patently clear that President Sirisena is yet opposed to his Prime Minister. This is likely to result in further friction or paralyse the administration. Although the TNA voted on the basis that retention of the Prime Minister and government were necessary to implement the 2015 mandate including the promulgation of a new Constitution , it is highly unlikely that such an eventuality would come to pass. President Sirisenas current political approach as well as the racist campaign that would be unleashed by the Rajapaksa led opposition may constrain the government from proceeding further on that road. 
What is likely to happen or not happen in the future is in the realm of the unknown. What is certain is the here and now. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has withstood and overcome a tripartite conspiracy to topple him from his post. The minority political parties especially the TNA have played a constructive role in helping the Premier to defeat the no-confidence motion. The TNA has demonstrated that it is a political party that will not shirk its duties despite racist intimidation to do what is right and ensure the stability and continuity of an elected government. The decision has been based on principle rather than expediency. It is very probable that the TNA will be severely criticised by those supportive of the NCM but the party should be proud that it has done the right thing. 
Tamil people coming in from the cold
The Tamil people have for long been estranged from the Sri Lankan mainstream. They are now slowly and surely coming in from the cold of political wilderness and entering Sri Lankas public life again. By doing so they are proving that they are and will be an integral component of the Sri Lankan nation. The TNAs commendable and constructive role in helping defeat the no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister is indisputable proof of that positive and progressive process.

Vehicle registration cancelled if revenue license not obtained for five years
	
The Motor Traffic Department (DMT) had introduced a project to cancel the vehicle registrations if it had not obtained revenue license for more than five years.
Speaking to the Media DMT Commissioner General A.H.K. Jagath Chandrasiri said, We have already requested all Divisional Secretariats to provide a report on vehicles that have not been renewed revenue license for five years, he said.
After receiving the report the DMT would take measures to inform the vehicle owners that their vehicle registration has been cancelled. A letter would be sent to the owner requesting them to present the relevant documents to cancel the vehicle registration.
Finally, the cancelled vehicle numbers would be published in newspapers to make it more transparent.
All vehicle owners should obtain a valid revenue license annually. Concessions will be provided for the vehicles which are in garages for repairs for the longer period of time without being used, he said.
He said the owners should inform the DMT the reasons for not using their vehicle to obtain a non-user certificate after inspecting them through the provincial commissioners of the DMT. The non-user certificate should be obtained at the time of being sent to the garage. The certificate cannot be backdated. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Wheeler-dealing to take local bodies
	

Three JO politicos had recently rendezvoused with a pro-Maithri stalwart behind closed doors at a five-star hotel overlooking a river.

Two of the JO trio are siblings and the other is a nephew of a leading politico. The pro-Maithri character, a typical turncoat, is said to be known in his home turf as Gemba (frog). An original Green, he later joined the Blue party. In more recent time, he closely moved with the former strongman until the carrot of high office drew him to the Maithri faction. He too hails from a political family.
Their talks were aimed at working out a strategy to have a Pohottuwa guy elected to the chair of an important mini-governing body, they say.

Who decides when ministers go on strike SLPP
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) today asked who would resolve the plight of people, when some of the ministers boycott Cabinet meetings.
Referring to the decision by Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) ministers to boycott Cabinet meetings, SLPP Chairman G.L. Peiris said this was similar to the month-long strike launched by the university non-academic staff.
The administration of the country is in ruins. Who will resolve peoples issues when ministers boycott Cabinet meetings It was only last week the Government printed currencies worth Rs.100 Billion. This will bankrupt the country with the inflation and the cost of living rising. Amid these questions still unanswered, the government has found time to approve Rs.43 million to purchase a super luxury vehicle for a minister, he told a news briefing.
Meanwhile, Prof. Peiris said the government was attempting to postpone the provincial council elections like it postponed the local government elections for two and a half years.
The terms of the three PCs have expired. Three more will be dissolved at the end of this year. The government has no option but to hold the election for these councils, as it is legally bound to do so. We wont allow the government to postpone the PC elections, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
