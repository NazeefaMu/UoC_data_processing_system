Are they now reluctant to meet face to face?
	
	
	People in our country have made it a practice to invite VIPs to officiate as witnesses at marriage registrations. Parents consider it a great honour and a privilege to have the Head of the State as an official witness at the marriage of their son or daughter.
Despite now being out of office, even the deposed Big Boss continues to receive as many invitations to weddings as the New Big Boss does these days.
Both the new Big Boss and the deposed Big Boss had been invited to two weddings held recently ? the bridegroom of one wedding was the son of a former commander of a security force who had also served a stint as the country?s envoy in a foreign country and the bride at the other wedding was the daughter of a sibling of a former Minister.
Only the deposed Big Boss had turned up to sign as the witness at both weddings. Disappointed parents and wedding guests are said to have openly wondered whether the relations between the incumbent and the deposed have grown so bitter that they now avoid face-to-face meetings.

The Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) today informed Colombo Magistrate Nishantha Pieris that no offence had been committed in the incident where a small airplane was found in the stores belonging to CSN TV Channel at Narahenpitiya and that the case would be withdrawn.
Detectives said according to investigations the airplane was one built by Ray Wijewardene and not in flying condition and had been handed over to former President?s son Yoshitha Rajapaksa by film director and producer Chandiran Ratnam.
The CCD sought a Court order to return the airplane to the late Ray Wijewardene?s family and that the case would be withdrawn.
Counsel Niroshan Siriwardena appearing for CSN TV Channel and Mr. Rajapaksa said the plane was kept in the store to be used as a display item.
He said his client was unable to remove the airplane from the stores because of his client?s involvement in other work.
The counsel requested the Magistrate to direct the CCD to allow his client to open the store which had been sealed by the Narahenpita Police.
The CCD requested the Magistrate to order Mr. Rajapaksa to open the store after the airplane had been removed from the stores.(T. Farook Thajudeen)

Consumers get a raw deal from new boss!
	
	This particular state-owned trading undertaking was established long ago to give a fair deal to ordinary consumers.
This establishment which was meant to be a boon to the general public turned out to be a bane from time to time? when the political appointees who helmed it resorted to malpractices either to oblige their Masters or for personal gain.
Employees of this establishment have now begun talking in whispers among themselves about the ?funny doings? of their new Boss which they say, are a far cry from the ?yahapalanaya? concept of the Maithri administration. For instance, he has issued a directive to the procurement division that they should purchase supplies only from the suppliers he recommends.
?Because of this directive, we have to purchase goods from a few select suppliers at the prices they dictate in the absence of the usual competition,? an employee complained.
A few bold ones at the establishment had pointed out to the new Boss that his directive, apart from constituting a departure from the recognized practice is causing an injustice to the consumers. Taking offence at ?challenging his authority?, the new Boss has already taken disciplinary action against a bold female official. The other bold ones fear similar treatment from the angry new Boss sooner or later.

Deposed Big Boss snubs advice to take a rest
	
	
	A provincial council member active in Samurdhi affairs recently had a one-on-one chat with the new Big Boss.
He took advantage of this opportunity to explain to the new Big Boss how easy it would be for the Blues to win the upcoming general elections if they could enlist the support of the deposed Big Boss.
The new Big Boss looked annoyed. ?You ask your former Boss to take a rest at home,? he told the provincial politico. ?You also advise him to tell the country loud and clear that he has retired from politics.? His voice took a sad note as he added: ?He will be in trouble if he disregards this piece of advice.?
The provincial politico dutifully conveyed this message to the deposed Big Boss. Greeting the message with a derisive laughter, the deposed Big Boss remarked: ?Our party is not anybody?s heirloom. I too have as much a stake in the party as any other person. Let us wait and see how things will turn out.?

Video:<U+200B>Drunk man challenges elephant in Udawalawe
	
Alcohol often goes hand in hand with violence, but no matter the level of intoxication most people would dare not pick a fight with an elephant.
This was not the case recently in Sri Lanka, when a drunk man in a national park decided to antagonize an elephant as horrified onlookers stood by.
Video of the encounter shows members of the crowd shouting at the man to leave the elephant alone as it had killed a person only days earlier.?
But ignoring their pleas, he begins taunting the angry creature by first lying down on a bank directly in front of it.
Despite the increasingly urgent cries from the crowd, he gets up and climbs down the bank until he is standing in front of the animal.
Suddenly, it loses its temper and rushes towards him. He falls over and is trampled by it before it almost immediately wanders away disinterested.
The drunk man is then pulled up the grassy bank and it appears as though part of his ear has been torn off and his once-muddy shirt is left covered in blood.
The footage was filmed in the Udawalawe National Park in Sri Lanka, where it's believed around 250 Sri Lankan Elephants - a species native to the country.
A policeman also appears in the background of the video, though it is unclear if he arrested or intervened following the fight. (Daily Mail)

Guillotine hangs over Western provincial chief
	
	
	Government top brass at a recent exclusive powwow were taking stock of the general political situation in the country.? Their attention turned to the irritable presence of an adversary at the Western Council openly hostile to both the Maithri faction of the SLFP and the Green party.
Their general agreement was that this common foe, the provincial Chief could be reduced to a nonentity the moment the ruling power was switched over to the group led by the Greens.
Now the affidavits are ready to bring about the proposed change in the power equation. What is stalling the move is the indecision over the choice of a successor and the new board of Ministers.
An overture was made to the Reds and the response, though not negative was not in the affirmative either.???? They were prepared to extend critical support to the proposed new administration without a direct hand in it. The General?s party is willing, but wants a Ministerial portfolio in exchange for their support.
The process already set in motion will come to a head shortly leading to the taking of a hard decision whether the incumbent Chief will stay put or will go, they say.

	A group of Blue bigwigs were putting their thick heads together, the other day, to decide what action they should take if the new Big Boss failed to dissolve the Diyawanna council by April 23.
The senior Banda from the Hills, Gentle John from the City of Gems, Flamboyant Dilan from Uva and Artful Amare from the Deep South were among the participants at this discussion.
?Perhaps, the Greens will quit the government in a huff,? one of them hazarded a guess. ?What should we do if they quit?? another asked.
?We command the majority in the House and there is another year for the term to expire. Let us form a new government under the leadership of the Compassionate One.?
?Will he agree to such an arrangement??
This drew a quick response from the first interlocutor. ?He is left with no other alternative. After all, he is the leader of our party.?
The most senior politico of the group said with unconcealed elation: ?If we can form a government of our own, we can face the general elections with the added advantage of a Ministerial portfolio under our belt. And that would be fine!?
They finally decided to discuss the matter with the new Big Boss.

Intense rivalry over ?manape? in Kolonnawa
	
	
	All present indications are that there will be an unprecedentedly keen contest in the Colombo district at the general elections round the corner.
Certain would-be-candidates from the Green party are unofficially in the fray already in the district in a bid to increase their preference vote bank.
The rivalry over preference votes among the Green party hopefuls appear to be more intense in Kolonnawa than elsewhere in the district.? They say several Green aspirants are vying to grab a slice of the Green vote won by Mariks at the previous PC election. Among them is a Green politico gunning for a top job. This politico held a highly publicized meeting in Kolonnawa the other day. His picture on a propaganda poster plastered all over had been ripped off the previous night.
The politico found out through discreet inquiries as to who was behind tearing off his picture from the posters. He did not want to kick up a row with his rival. Instead, he sent peace emissaries to win him over. However, the response he got was not encouraging, they say.

Sanga creates history with 4th successive century
	
		 		 
		 
			
Kumar Sangakkara created One Day International cricket history today at the Bellerive Oval during their ICC World Cup 2015 Pool A match against Scotland.
In the history of 3,631 ODIs before today, no batsman had scored 4 successive centuries. But on Wednesday, Sangakkara became the first ever batsman to achieve the feat. He brought up the historic ton, in 86 balls, with a couple on the last ball of the 34th over by Kyle Coetzer. This was Sangakkara's 25th ODI ton in 403rd match.
Going into the match with three consecutive tons at World Cup, which is also a new record, Sangakkara continued his dream run with the willow. Sangakkara's four hundreds in World Cup so far are - 105 not out Vs Bangladesh, 117 not out Vs England, 104 Vs Australia and 124 today.
Previously there have been batsmen registering three-figures scores in 3 innings in a row. But never 4 in 4. Ross Taylor (New Zealand), Quinton de Kock (South Africa), Zaheer Abbas (Pakistan), Herschelle Gibbs (South Africa), Saeed Anwar (Pakistan), AB de Villiers (South Africa) and Sangakkara had achieved this. Opting to bat first after having won the toss, Sri Lanka were put on track for a big total by the 37-year-old Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan, who also hit a hundred. Playing in his final World Cup, Sangakkara has decided to bow out on a high.
His batting exploits in the tournament have been outstanding. He is also the first batsman to hit 4 centuries in a single World Cup. He now has overall 5 tons in World Cups, joint second with Ricky Ponting (Australia). Sachin Tendulkar has most World Cup centuries with 6.(One India)

Sanga leads SL rout of Scotland
	
	Kumar Sangakkara became the first batsman to score four consecutive one-day centuries as Sri Lanka thrashed Scotland by 148 runs in the World Cup in Hobart on Wednesday.
	The left-hander hit 124 off 95 balls and Tillakaratne Dilshan made 104 as the Islanders piled up 363 for nine and then bowled Scotland out for 215 in 43.1 overs in the Pool A match at the Bellerive Oval.
	Skipper Preston Mommsen (60) and Freddie Coleman (70) put on 118 for the fourth wicket but they provided the only Scottish challenge as seamers Nuwan Kulasekara and Dushmantha Chameera grabbed three wickets each.
	Sangakkara also took two catches to overtake Adam Gilchrist as the most successful World Cup wicket-keeper with 54 dismissals. The Australian had 52 victims to his name.
	Sri Lanka ended the league with four wins from six matches and now await an undecided opponent in the first quarter-final at the Sydney Cricket Ground on March 18.
	Scotland's fifth successive defeat means they will take an early flight home after their final league match against Australia at the same venue on Saturday.
	Sangakkara, 37, who will retire from one-day cricket after the World Cup, had made 105 not out against Bangladesh, an unbeaten 117 against England and 104 against Australia.
	He is the the leading scorer in the ongoing tournament with 496 runs from six games, followed in second place by 38-year-old Dilshan with 395 runs.
	The pair put on 195 for the second wicket after Lahiru Thirimanne had been snapped up in the slips off Alasdair Evans in the sixth over after Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat.
	Scotland had to wait till the 35th over for their next success as Sangakkara and Dilshan toyed with the bowling in good batting conditions.
	Both batsmen reached their centuries off successive balls from Kyle Coetzer in the 34th over, Dilshan taking a single to record his second hundred in the tournament before Sangakkara followed next ball with two runs.
	Sangakkara leapfrogged six players who had scored three ODI centuries in a row -- Zaheer Abbas and Saeed Anwar of Pakistan, the South African trio of Herschelle Gibbs, AB de Villiers and Quinton de Kock, and Ross Taylor of New Zealand.
	Dilshan followed his unbeaten 161 against Bangladesh with his fourth World Cup century before he holed out in the deep off seamer Josh Davey.
	Davey struck two quick blows soon after, getting rid of Mahela Jayawardene and Sangakkara off successive balls as Sri Lanka slipped from 216 for one to 244 for four.
	Jayawardene, 37, who will also retire after the World Cup having already quit Test cricket, made two when he was caught at mid-off by Calum MacLeod.
	Sangakkara edged the next delivery to the wicket-keeper, sparking wild celebrations among the Scottish supporters in the stands.
	Skipper Angelo Mathews smashed 51 off 21 balls at the end, slamming four sixes in a row off spinner Matt Machan before being caught next ball on the mid-wicket fence.
	Sri Lanka, who were 216 for one at one stage, lost eight wickets for 147 runs as the later batsmen attacked the inexperienced Scotland attack.
	Sri Lanka go into the knock-out rounds beset with injuries, with seamer Dhammika Prasad ruled out of the tournament before it started and Jeevan Mendis, Dimuth Karunaratne and Dinesh Chandimal sidelined during it.
	Veteran left-arm spinner Rangana Herath is yet to recover from a finger injury. (Reurers)

	Feeling the heat of the rising election fever in the country, the new Big Boss and his second-in-command had held two rounds of talks on the issue of dissolving the Diyawanna council on April 23.
The second-in-command at these talks had insisted that the council be dissolved on April 23 as planned as part of the 100-day agenda.
But the new Big Boss was not in favour of the idea, given the practical difficulties in enacting the proposed electoral reforms within this timeframe.
He favoured the idea of changing the existing electoral system and clipping his executive wings at one go.
However, the second-in-command had put his foot down that the dissolution is a must by April 23 even if they have to enact the amendment to prune the Executive Presidential powers without going for electoral reforms.
A key Minister who was present at the talks had backed the stand taken by the new Big Boss, they say.

Visiting journos get opposition chief?s goat
	
	A group of journalists from several international media outfits was in the country recently on a fact-finding mission.
They exchanged views with several political and civil society leaders with particular reference to the significant political developments since the new Maithri regime took office.
The visiting media delegates received an invitation from the one who leads the opposition in the Diyawanna House for talks.
The foreign media personnel who called on the opposition chief at his office were given a warm welcome. They sought the views of the opposition chief on the landmark political changes taking place under the new administration. They inquired about the present status of the Right to Information Bill and also his stand on several controversial issues. They also raised questions relating to certain actions by the previous government which constituted serious assaults on media freedom.
Visibly irked by the questions posed to him, the opposition chief indicated to them that they were going too far in pursuit of information. However, there was no relenting on the part of the foreign journalists. And the opposition chief in a sudden burst of fury yelled at them, ?We are not interested in so-called ideals upheld by you people in the West, nor are we prepared to dance to the tune set by Western powers??
Flabbergasted by this acrid outpouring, the visiting journalists walked out calling it a day. They readily agreed to a remark made by one of them that they had never met an opposition chief like this one in any other country.
