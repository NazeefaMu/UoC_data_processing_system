6.5% bus fare hike from July
	
As per the annual revisions, the fares of private buses and buses attached to the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) would be increased up by 6.5% from July 01, 2017, Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) President Gemunu Wijeratne said at a media briefing held in Maradana today.
He said that Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva had also expressed his consent for the fare revision.
Explaining the need of a bus fare hike, he said that despite the unchanged prices of fuel, overhead costs for service and repair, salaries of the crew, tyres and tubes and other electrical work for the maintenance had become a heavy burden on bus owners.
However, the final decision on fare increase will be taken by the National Transport Commission (NTC) which is yet to be reached.
Last year bus fare hike percentage was 6%.
Meanwhile, LPBOA President Wijeratne criticised the NTC for failing to implement the recommendations given through the National Policy on annual bus fare amendment.
He described the NTC as a paradise for route permits smugglers.
The National Transport Commission is fully corrupted. It does not serve any purpose for the betterment of the public, he charged.
It has failed to carry out the re-tendering process of route permits for buses operating on the highways. The issuance of route permits has become a racket operated by a network of corrupt officials. It is a waste of public money to pay for those who are working in the Commission. Minister de Silva should leave his post because he had failed to handle the Commission properly, Wijeratne said.
He added that they were awaiting legal action against the Commission upon complaints lodged by them at Police Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Canada to deport Sri Lankan murder suspect
	
Canada's Immigration Department says a murder suspect who was set free after his trial exceeded the legal length limit is expected to be sent back to Sri Lanka in the next two weeks.
Ewa Staszewicz, a lawyer for the department, is confirming steps are being taken to obtain the necessary travel documents for Sivaloganathan Thanabalasingam.
Thanabalasingam, 31, told an Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada hearing today he doesn't believe he will be in danger in his home country and no longer needs to be protected as a refugee.
He was accused of murdering his wife in 2012 but the charges were stayed in April after the length of his legal proceedings were deemed to have violated a Supreme Court of Canada ruling that set time limits for trials to be completed.
He was detained by Canada Border Services Agency upon his release and a deportation order was issued against him.
Thanabalasingam, who came to Canada as a refugee, originally appealed the deportation order but later changed his mind and asked to be sent back to Sri Lanka.(CTV News)

Delays in LG polls cost many lives from floods: JO
	
Governments delay in holding the local government elections cost many lives and property damages during the recent disaster experienced due to the adverse weather conditions as the local government institutions were inactive during the period, joint opposition All Island Association of Heads of Local Government Bodies today charged.
The association President Udeni Athukorala said the representatives in the local government bodies were failed to support the affected as most of the Provincial Councils and Pradehiya Sabhas were dissolved during the period.
Mr. Athukorala said during the Former President Rajapaksa's rule the country's local government bodies supported the disaster victims and carried out rescue operations on time to protect both lives and property.
During MRs tenure just after the disaster happened cooked meals were distributed for the affected. Dry rations were given after three days. When the flood hit Ratnapura at 2014 we were able to evacuate the people in Kalutara as the officials knew it was next target. There was a proper coordination within the local government bodies in the grass-root level, he said.
He said the Provincial Councils and Pradehiya Sabhas contribution were not received in the recent flood and landslide disaster as the elections were not conducted and those institutions are not functioning. He said government media institutions were not carried out any relief programmes.
Mr. Athukorala said the President visited the disaster prone areas while the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa were out of the country. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

USS Lake Erie joins flood assistance efforts in SL
	
U.S. Embassy Charg daffaires Robert Hilton welcomed USS Lake Erie on its arrival in Colombo today with embarked U.S. military personnel to support humanitarian assistance efforts across flood-affected areas across Sri Lanka.

We share in the sorrow of the Sri Lankan people at the loss of life and devastation brought on by this disaster, said Adm. Harry Harris, commander U.S. Pacific Command. Friends help friends, and the United States stands with Sri Lanka during this difficult time.

Because of the long-standing friendship between the United States and Sri Lanka, American forces are able to respond with critically needed capabilities. In addition, U.S. Pacific Command will soon send military aircraft and other specialists to assist with disaster relief and risk reduction.

Whether its rehabilitating flooded areas and schools or providing food and water, our sailors are well trained for this mission and we are ready to provide relief and assistance to the people of Sri Lanka, said Capt. Darren McPherson, commanding officer, USS Lake Erie.

The U.S. military has a history of successfully working with international relief organizations and host nations to provide relief to those affected by disaster. In the past year, U.S. Pacific Command joined the Sri Lankan military for multinational assistance programs in both Jaffna and Hambantota, providing medical training for first responders, school renovations, and health clinics to surrounding communities. In addition, civil affairs officers from the U.S. and Sri Lankan militaries have partnered over the past three years to host a series of disaster management and coordination training workshops, bringing in civilian and military experts from across the region.

Charg d'affaires Robert Hilton welcomed the ship on arrival in Colombo and said, Were grateful for the U.S. Navy and Pacific Commands participation in this humanitarian effort and close partnership with Sri Lanka.

All of these visits have been instrumental to establishing relationships with the Sri Lankan military and civil service agencies, allowing U.S. military personnel to efficiently respond when needed.

USS Lake Erie left her homeport of San Diego in May 2017 on an independent deployment to the Western Pacific.
