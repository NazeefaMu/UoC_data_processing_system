A new political alignment to jack up Pohottuwa!
	

One or two members of the Group 16 nursing high political ambitions are reportedly planning a new political alignment.

They have already planned to revive a political party now in doldrums to use it as the core of the proposed new alignment and then invite a section of Group 16 to join forces with them. A Group 16 member from the Colombo district, who is known to be eying a very high-office is expected to lead this new alignment.
The founder of the political party they propose to buy or borrow to use as the core of their new alignment is currently on a diplomatic assignment abroad, they say.
The news about this new alignment has already reached the yahapalanaya bigwigs as well as the former strongman.
The main objective of those planning the new alignment is to add muscle to Pohottuwa at the eleventh hour, they say.

ASP Liyanage not executing diplomatic duties: Buddhika
	
Deputy Minister Buddhika Pathirana said yesterday that the Ambassador to Qatar A.S.P. Liyanage is running the Sri Lankan school in Qatar for money instead of executing the diplomatic duties.
He said the President, Prime Minister and the Foreign Ministry should take action against the ambassador who is attempting to snatch about Rs. 450 million (QR 9mn) worth of funds of the Sri Lankan school.
Addressing a press briefing which was arranged to reveal and addressed the matter of alleged acquisition of Stafford Sri Lankan School in Qatar to the Qatar Embassy by Mr. Liyanage, the minister said the ambassador is acting for his own agenda and accused him of not doing any diplomatic service to the Sri Lankans
A group of academic and non-academic staff of the Sri Lankan school including its former Chairman Kumudu Fonseka and Principal Upali Jayasinghe who met the minister yesterday at his office, also joined with the press briefing to reveal their side of the story.
The Qatar ambassador is a disgrace to the diplomatic mission and to the country. He is trying to dissolve the school management board and change the constitution to privatize the school. Mr. Liyanage is tarnishing the countrys image. He is doing everything on his own with regard to the school funds and the rest of the world thinks this is the opinion of the Sri Lankan government. I could not understand who is behind the Ambassador. The Qatar embassy had become a kingdom of thugs and madmen, the deputy minister said.
He said the President should appoint qualified professionals as Sri Lankan envoys abroad without appointing retired personnel in an attempt to please them.
Former Chairman of the Stafford school Kumudu Fonseka said that he requested the government to prevent the embassy from intervening into the affairs of the school and to direct the embassy to focus on diplomatic affairs.
The school was functioning for over 17 years without any issue or any intervention of the embassy. Today, the ambassador is using his immunity to take control of the school which has a fund of Rs.450 million. The government should prevent this crisis, he said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Aspirants galore though the poll is miles away!
	

Although the big poll is miles away, two or three aspirants are said to be already gearing up for the fray. Meanwhile, the names of two other persons had been mentioned in this connection in political circles last week.

One of these two hopefuls is a son of a prominent politico and the other is a governing one now in office.
The claims that the politicians son makes have become a source of both good humour and derisive mirth for most politicos, who know him well. He claims, they say, that he was quite active in politics from his school days and what draws derisive guffaws is his claim that it was he who gave the leadership to the popular movement that brought yahapalanaya into power. 
The other aspirant, the governing one hails from a prominent political family in the South. One of his brothers is a sitting Diyawanna member. These days he is reportedly meeting friends and well-wishers informally singly and in groups, to apprise them of his plans. However, he has not announced his candidacy officially so far.
Going by the present indications, seven to eight candidates are expected to enter the fray at the coming big poll, they say.

Two white-collar ones facing a disciplinary inquiry for alleged syphoning off fuel from a storage located in an area described as the lungs of the district are reportedly worshipping a banyan tree planted in the premises of this establishment every morn and evening and praying that they are saved from their predicament.

The duo had reportedly been in the thick of fraudulent activity with the connivance of a once powerful politico and they have now begun seeking the intervention of supernatural powers to escape punishment as the politico is no longer able to help them,

Buddys arrest made him wild!
	

A prominent politico from Wayamba has developed a sudden antipathy towards wildlife rangers, they say.

The politico of late is said to be going out of the way to be nasty to the wildlife protectors of all ranks.
He would find some excuse to lash out at the wildlife people at official confabs and other forums these days.
By the way, it has come to light that the wildlife ones had recently caught red-handed a buddy of this politico hunting game protected by law. On being caught, the buddy had mentioned the name of the politico, but the Rangers had ignored the pull and proceeded to prosecute him.
Meanwhile, a group of wildlife workers has decided to boycott in future any official discussion convened or to be attended by this politico, they say.

CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE AND GOTABHAYAS SOLUTION
	

	The assumption of passivity on the part of Delhi in the face of such reverses is a risk for the Colombo administration
	
	
	Gotabayas stance is that economic empowerment of all the communities was his vision for a political solution
	
	
	His primary solution for the Tamil people will be to give them economic freedom
	
	
	Forget political rights and claims in exchange for economic prosperity
	

n a speech to the Inter-Religious Forum on the 35th anniversary of the anti-Tamil violence of Black July 83, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga made an impassioned plea for either a new Constitution or a Constitutional Amendment to resolve the long-standing ethno-national question. The enterprise is flawed and fraught.
1. Even if one assumes for the sake of argument that a new Constitution may be desirable or even ideal, this does not prove it is necessary, still less imperative.
2. It is almost certainly not the case that what CBK deems desirable or necessary is in fact politically feasible.
3. In her effort to achieve the ideal or the desirable, she may counter-productively reinforce the political, social and ideological tendencies she is seeking to combat, and wreck the laudable goal she is striving to achieve.

CBKs The Package Reloaded will give rise to a far more virulently nationalist regime than that of her immediate successor.
Gotabaya Rajapaksa has recently been shown on TV and quoted on a supportive website as saying to the Tamil media that If he is President, his primary solution for the Tamil people will be to give them economic freedom.
A leading English-language newspaper reported on Saturday, July 28, in a story entitled Prez polls 2019 that:
Gotabhaya Rajapaksa on Thursday (July 26) told Colombo-based senior Tamil print and electronic journalists that countrywide economic empowerment was the key to post-war stabilityRajapaksa said so when the Tamil media sought his views on a gamut of issues, ranging from the status of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution enacted consequent to the Indo-Lanka Peace Accord to the government responsibility in respect of squattersV. Thanabalasingam, former chief editor of a popular Tamil Daily and currently consultant at another reputed Tamil language newspaper, tweeted on Thursday evening that Gotabhaya said that economic empowerment of all the communities was his vision for a political solution.
If country-wide economic empowerment was the key to post-war stability, how come the opening up of the economy and an initial 8% growth rate under President Jayewardene did not lead to political stability and could not prevent a descent into extreme conflict
This is because, as an Asian giant with a laser-like intellect who knew everything about economic empowerment and keys to political stability, Lee Kuan Yew, repeatedly emphasized about Ceylon/Sri Lanka from the 1960s through to the post-war period (Conversations with Lee Kuan Yew, Prof Tom Plate, 2010), the key to both economic and political stability in Sri Lanka was the political resolution of the underlying Tamil issue.
Instead, economic empowerment was GRs vision for a political solution. But thats an economic solution, not a political one.
Wheres the political componentor isnt there one Then why call it a political solution Now, what happens to the political process, the process of political dialogue
Where does that leave political power-sharing, the Indo-Lanka Accord, the 13th Amendment, and indeed the entire history of 60 years of the narrative of negotiations from the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact of 1957 which his father and cousins supported What happens to the political content of the Tamil Question
What of the political rights of the Tamil minority as a people, a community, a collectivethe right of some measure of self-rule and self-governance, of autonomy, of irreducible political space in the contiguous areas in which they constitute a majority This was the basis of the B-C Pact of 1957 and the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987.

"Any attempt to roll-back devolution granted under Indias auspices will generate a shift in Tamil Nadu that will not prove inconsequential for Delhi"

GRs statement signals the imminent end of all that. He is proposing the same thing to the Tamils that President Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushners Deal of the Century propose to -- and for -- the Palestinians: Forget political rights and claims in exchange for economic prosperity. There are no Palestinian takers. Will there be any elected Tamil political takers Or any Indian takers
Gotabayas formula for buying out Tamil political identity and the Northern Province erases the content and trajectory of Tamil political consciousness from 1949, and Indian diplomatic engagement in Sri Lanka dating back to the efforts of Indira Gandhis special envoy G. Parathasarathy Sr. in 1984.
It is the equivalent of the Netanyahu attempt to bury the Oslo Accords and the two-State solution. But can the paradigm shift of the Tamil Question from that of autonomous political space at the periphery to economic empowerment/freedom, be done unilaterally
It is only half-correct that the TNA walked away from the negotiations with the Rajapaksa Government in 2011-2012. It was certainly the TNA that provoked the breakdown by going beyond the 13th Amendment and demanding that all State land in the Province should be used by the Centre only with the permission of the Chief Minister.
But it was the Government that paused the talks after the odious Sajin Vaas Gunawardena (who said to President Rajapaksa in my presence that he preferred to talk to Sumanthiran and not to Sampanthan because the latter has baggage, and MR promptly disagreed, rudely provoked Sampanthan, engineered a clash with him, planted the story in the newspapers and provoked President Rajapaksa into calling a halt to talks by giving him a distorted version of events.
The political process resumed when, after a dialogue with Japan, President Rajapaksa courageously declared elections to the Northern PC in 2013. I was present, including in the official photo-portrait on the steps, at the investiture of Justice Wigneswaran as Chief Minister in 2013.

"Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has recently been shown on TV and quoted on a supportive website as saying to the Tamil media that If he is President, his primary solution for the Tamil people will be to give them economic freedom"

The atmosphere at the sit-down luncheon hosted by President MR with Sampanthan, Wigneswaran and Sumanthiran seated around him, signalled a fresh start.
Mr. Sampanthan told Lalith Weeratunga that if the Northern Provincial Council were allowed to function smoothly, there could be a million Tamil votes available to President Rajapaksa.
This, however, was not to be. The reappointment of Gen. Chandrasiri as Governor of the Northern Province even after the Northern PC election, and the protracted retention of Rear-Admiral Wijewickrema as Eastern Province Governor, despite promises made at the highest level to India not to renew their Governorship after their current terms ended, utterly vitiated the atmosphere and turned an electorally vulnerable, already porous Indian rearguard into a vanguard of a regime-change project. Colombos decisive strategic political mistake was made under pressure from the securocracy. The Tamil Question, like every nationality question the world over, is primarily a political question which requires a structural-reformist political solution.

"Mr. Sampanthan told Lalith Weeratunga that if the Northern Provincial Council were allowed to function smoothly, there could be a million Tamil votes available to President Rajapaksa.

Gotabayas Military Wing or ex-Military Wing is so strategically myopic that it doesnt comprehend that the unilateral re-framing of and retrenchment from a political solution embedded and encased in a bilateral accord is not a viable option because Sri Lanka is near-unique in its geopolitical and geo-strategic vulnerability: it has no rearguard; no safe rear-base.
Cuba, an island, had Spanish-speaking Latin America with its progressive governments and movements as rearguard, while Pakistan and Burma/Myanmar have China as rearguard due to contiguity and overland logistical accessibility.
Sri Lanka, a small island with Tamil Nadu, an ethnic kin-state of its restive Northern populace, as an immediate neighbour, is considerably more vulnerable and requires an alliance with Delhi as a semi-rearguard or substitute rearguard, just as it imperatively requires an alliance with China as an economic powerhouse and strategic balancing factor.
Any attempt to roll-back devolution granted under Indias auspices will generate a shift in Tamil Nadu that will not prove inconsequential for Delhi.
It is exceedingly unlikely that Prime Minister Modi and Indias present generation of foreign policy managers and diplomats will wish the record to show that the reforms which two Congress administrations  led by the father and grandmother of the PMs young challenger--and an earlier generation of diplomats secured for Sri Lankas Tamils were reversed and lost on their watch.
The assumption of passivity on the part of Delhi in the face of such reverses is a risk that is imprudent for any future Colombo administration to take.

Extravagant with public funds!
	

Yet another case of criminal waste of public funds attributed to a high Diyawanna political authority has raised many an eyebrow in the public administration circles.

In this instance, the political authority concerned had got an ornamental pond at the centre of the ground floor of his official residence demolished and a redundant deluxe bathroom put up in its place at a cost of Rs. 4 million.
The political authority had got this bathroom put up when there are two toilets already available on the ground floor. Besides, every room upstairs has an attached bathroom, they say. Employees in the public sector say that four modest houses for homeless families could have been constructed with the money spent on this unnecessary bathroom.

Fate of the disabled and carer
	

A 67-year-old mother was reported to have murdered her 45-year-old disabled daughter after decades of torment. The crumbling shack where these two lived was displayed in Lankadeepa newspaper on July 21. Her husband had left the family when marital issues related to a disabled child emerged. Rather than stoning the sinner, I would prefer to analyze the caregivers anguish in a social setup where disabled are shunned.
Sri Lanka has many disability acts, but none practical. To make matters worse, owning a disabled child is attributed to previous sins committed by the parents bycertain religious fractions. Hence, social stigma in bringing up a handicapped person is automatically created. In the above scenario, the 67-year-old mother might have attempted with all her might to care for her adult paralyzed daughter. Imagine moving and handling an adult patient by a weary old woman for four decades. Playing the role of the caregiver while trying to make ends meet. At the end the carer might have realised that she could not move any further. 
I see disabled patients and devastated families on a daily basis. Rehabilitation is not always possible as we fail at the point of social integration of the handicapped. Sri Lanka lacks a proper mechanism of financing a disabled patient. The allowance provided after many obstacles is barely adequate for even transportation. 
I was once in charge of a small spinal injury rehabilitation hospital in Pompaimadu, in Vavuniya district. We had patients from all walks of life, starting from ex-military cadres to traffic accident victims. Searching for employment opportunities was a failure, as even when generous employers offered jobs, disability/ wheelchair access at work places were an issue. 
Northern province alone is said to have more than 40,000 disabled people. Imagine a world class garment factory fully managed by the disabled in the north. This would be an international hit. The efficacy of the disabled patients would be more than a paid garment factory worker, if properly motivated. 
Sri Lanka needs to first of all accept the disabled. Community based rehabilitation does not cost if the citizens are ready to accept them. Making use of their capabilities would be the second step. Certain research shows that the commonest cause of death of a wheelchair bound patient is suicide.The average age of suicide is 50. This happens when the last few people who actually cared for the disabled, usually their parents die. We live in a country where compassion towards all living beings is preached via all forms of media. Yet Sri Lankans arent still prepared to walk their talk and make a change in the attitude towards disabled.

There is a steel factory set up by an investor from an Asian country in an area in the North-Western part of the country where donkeys freely roam.

This factory is a major enterprise, has been drawing the covetous eyes of the politicos ruling the roost in the area.
Of these interested politicos, there was a Diyawanna one holding a high office at the State level who got bold enough to demand various favours from the management. They obliged in certain instances but there had been occasions where they had been compelled to say, sorry.
This politico who is known for his habit of demanding his pound of flesh was not ready to take no for an answer and decided to get what he wanted by throwing about his weight. One day, he phoned up the manager of the factory and told him: Pay me a percent cut from the profit you make on every product you turn out! Or be prepared to close shop!
The latest report says that the foreign investor has decided to close the factory and move his capital to another country in Asia!

GDPR & the Local Travel Industry
	
Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) in collaboration with SecurMatic.com organised a GDPR awareness summit to all its members & the hotel community (THASL) on the 11th of July 2018 at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute in Colombo.
This summit is part of the ongoing exercise undertaken by SLAITO to educate the local industry on the new European General Data Protection Regulation that came into effect on the 25th of May 2018.
With over 35% of inbound travelers originating from the EU, Sri Lankan Tour Operators and Hotel Operators should follow this data protection regulation said Haritha Perera  Chairman of SLAITO.
He emphasized that since this is something new to the industry, it will be a long and tedious journey for Operators to be compliant due to the existing business practices. But said, it is essential we follow the guidelines for the future of the industry and that we immediately start the process to be compliant.
The guest speakers included Ranjika Manamperi  CEO of SecurMatic.com, a Cyber Security company specializing in cyber risk management and GDPR compliance solutions to the travel industry, presented GDPR implementation guidelines covering the local tour and hotel operators.
Ranjika spoke to the applicability of GDPR to the Sri Lanka Travel Industry. If your organisation directly or indirectly markets travel services to EU based travellers and or if your organisation is part of EU based company and or if you carry out DMC services on behalf of a travel company that targets EU based travellers, your company will come under GDPR scope, she said.Ranjika also stressed that implementing GDPR includes changes and improvements to operational processes, supplier relationships, technology and staff awareness. GDPR is an ongoing process in your organisation. It requires a cultural shift in handling personal data and data security she said. Ranjika also emphasised to local companies to pay attention to the data protection and liability clauses incorporated in vendor and B2B agreements.
Samantha Simms, an information law attorney from UK, who is the founder of The Information Collective, spoke about the need to protect customers personal information and the impact to Organisations when a data breach does occur. Due to the myriad number of partners involved in providing travel solutions it can be challenging to control what happens to customers information when its transferred onwards. She stressed that under GDPR your accountability to protect that information doesnt end after the information is transferred but you have an accountability to ensure that your partners handle the same information securely and notify you in the event of a data breach. She also raised the need to simplify privacy and data protection to enable global organizations to turn legal compliance such as GDPR into commercial opportunities.
Following the presentations, there was a panel discussion moderated by Dayan Gunasekera comprising industry experts namely Sanjeewa Anthony (THASL), Upali Rathnayake (Sri Lanka Tourist Board) Harith Perera (SLAITO), Hasitha Gamage (Sudath Perera law firm), Ranjika Manamperi (Secur Matic) and Samantha Simms (Information Collective). SLAITO and THASL members posed many questions and clarifications pertaining to GDPR on a macro and micro level.

The Green party supporters from all parts of the district including those from the young Diyawanna ones electorate have made it a practice to approach the Madam seeking her intervention to get solutions to their problems or redress for their grievances. However, nowadays whenever party supporters from the young members electorate visit the Madams political office in the city, her aides would describe them to her as loyalists of her young rival.

Huawei overtakes Apple as No 2 smartphone maker
	
China-based Huawei took the second-place spot from Apple in a tightening global smartphone during the second quarter of this year, according to figures released Tuesday (Jul 31) by International Data Corporation.
South Korean consumer electronics titan Samsung remained the top smartphone maker, shipping 71.5 million handsets, but Huawei moved into second position with shipments of 54.2 million, according to IDC Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker.
Silicon Valley-based Apple shipped 41.3 million iPhones, claiming 12.1 per cent of the global market compared to 20.9 per cent for Samsung and 15.8 per cent for Huawei.
It was the first time since early 2010 that Apple wasn't in one of the top two spots in the smartphone market, according to IDC.
"The continued growth of Huawei is impressive, to say the least, as is its ability to move into markets where, until recently, the brand was largely unknown," said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers.
The iPhone did well, with the top-of-the-line iPhone X model a big seller in many markets, according to IDC. Apple was expected to wrest back control of the market with the release of new iPhone models in the fall.
Apple, Huawei and Samsung were the main contenders when it came to competition for high-end smartphones priced at US$700 or more, according to Reith.
Preliminary findings by IDC indicated a total of 342 million smartphones were shipped during the second quarter in a 1.8 per cent decline from the same period a year earlier.
The drop marked the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year declines in the global smartphone shipments, according to IDC.
Market saturation and climbing average selling prices were among factors curbing growth in the smartphone market, said Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker research manager Anthony Scarsella.
"Consumers remain willing to pay more for premium offerings in numerous markets and they now expect their device to outlast and outperform previous generations of that device which cost considerably less a few years ago," Scarsella said.

Its easy to treat patients but difficult to care for individuals
	

Speech delivered by President of the Sri Lanka Medical Association at the Inaugurations of the 131st Anniversary International Medical Congress on Thursday, July 26, 2018 at 6.00 pm at the Grand Ballroom, Galadari Hotel, Colombo.
The SLMA which was established in 1887 is generally and unambiguously acclaimed as the oldest national organization of medical professionals in Asia and Australasia. The SLMA comprises of and represents all grades of doctors from both the private and state sectors in Sri Lanka. This diversity gives us an indisputable and unique opportunity to serve as the apex academic and professional body for all doctors in Sri Lanka. This opportunity also places upon us the greater responsibility to serve as the academic, professional, moral and ethical guardians of the Sri Lankan medical profession. 
In todays medical practice the focus on the holistic/comprehensive care of the individual (as opposed to the patient) has become subservient to attempting to treat/manage illness in patients. The concept of preserving good health by incorporating and practising preventive and curative aspects of medicine to achieve physical, mental and social well-being in individuals, families and communities by medical professionals adhering to the highest possible standards of professional and ethical conduct seems to be an Utopian ideal instead of a practical day-to-day reality. Of course, there are numerous reasons for not being able to achieve this desired state, but the problem is that over time, we in Sri Lanka seem to be moving away from this ideal at a rapidly increasing speed. 
We as doctors are forgetting why patients come to us. We are imposing our perceived superior knowledge and skills on patients more often than not in an unsolicited manner. We have in short, developed and come to accept as normal, a system of doctor-centred care in which a medical condition/disease has become the fundamental issue needing the doctors attention. We have lost the art of focusing on the holistic health needs of patients. 
This is why we need to shift our focus back to patients, now more than ever. Our theme for 2018 Shifting focus from diseases to patients: Todays vision, Tomorrows reality is chosen to reflect upon the realities of health and healthcare in the 21st century, which is going to be patient/people driven from local, regional and global perspectives. The galaxy of resource persons at this conference would over the next three days, share their views as to how our vision of today will become tomorrows reality from the perspectives of their respective specialities. 
Ladies and Gentlemen, let me conclude by wishing you a pleasant and enjoyable evening and take this opportunity to remind myself and all of you that it is indeed easy to treat patients once we master the science of medicine, but it is infinitely more difficult to care for individuals until we master the art of medicine.
The orator, Dr. Ruvaiz Haniffa is the President of the Sri Lanka Medical Association.

KDU asks Rs. 6 mn from SAITM students
	
The first batch of the SAITM students, who were absorbed to the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KUD) for the MBBS Degree, had been instructed to pay around six million rupees as course fee for a period of five years, the Daily Mirror learns.
A parent of a SAITM student informed the Daily Mirror that they were informed this when they attended at the interviews today at the KDU premises in Ratmalana.
The interview board had instructed the parents to pay the 1st instalment of Rs 680,000 and a library deposit of Rs 6,000 which includes a non-refundable deposit of Rs. 2,000 before Monday (6) when they would be registered.
The students were told that the lectures would begin from Tuesday, August 7.
In a letter issued to the students, it had instructed to pay an annual course fee of Rs 1.36 mn where they have to make the first instalment by November 30 and in the same date each year.
In addition, the students were instructed to pay Rs. 35,000 for their uniform and Rs 2,000 for the KDU Diary.
In the letter issued to the parents, it had asked to deposit the money to BOC Account 9405831, Idama, Moratuwa Branch.
A parent of SAITM student said that they were told to forget what they have paid to SAITM institute and the students who failed to pay the KDU course fee would not be absorbed into KDU.
We were not informed about such thing. This is very wrong. We have pawned our properties to enrol our children at the SAITM. There is no way that we can pay such a big amount so soon. We were misled by the Government again, the parent told the Daily Mirror.
When contacted, KDU Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Defence and Administration) Major General Indunil Ranasinghe said that he could not disclose any detail of the enrolment officially.
I cannot comment on this matter officially. Im not aware of the letter given to SAITM students stating the course fees. I was not on the Interview Board, he added.
The John Kotelawala Defence University (Special Provisions) Bill, to absorb SAITM medical students into the KDU, was passed in Parliament with amendment on June 20. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Lessons we could learn from Indigenous people - EDITORIAL
	

ext week on August 9, the United Nations marks the International Day of the Worlds Indigenous People -- disclosing the little known fact that there are an estimated 370 million indigenous people living across 90 countries. They make up less than 5% of the worlds population, but account for 15% of the poorest. They speak an overwhelming majority of the worlds estimated 7,000 languages and represent 5,000 different cultural. According to the UN, indigenous people are inheritors and practitioners of rare cultures ways of relating to people and the environment. Despite their cultural differences, indigenous people from around the world share common problems related to the protection of their rights as distinct people. 
The UN says, indigenous people have sought recognition of their identities, way of life and their right to traditional lands, territories and natural resources for years, yet throughout history their rights have often been violated. Indigenous people today, are arguably among the most disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of people in the world. The international community now recognizes that special measures are required to protect their rights and maintain their distinct cultures and way of life.The 2018 Theme is Indigenous peoples migration and movement. As a result of loss of their lands, territories and resources due to development and other pressures, many indigenous people migrate to urban areas in search of better prospects of life, education and employment. Additionally, indigenous migrants face a myriad of challenges, including lack of access to public services and additional layers of discrimination, the UN says. 
The 2018 theme will focus on the current situation of indigenous territories, the root causes of migration, trans-border movement and displacement, with a specific focus on indigenous people living in urban areas and across international borders. 
In response to these threats, the UN General Assembly adopted a Resolution on Rights of Indigenous People, proclaiming 2019 as the International Year of Indigenous Languages.
While United States President Donald Trump is boasting about making America great again and imposing strict curbs on immigrants, including the building of a wall on the southern border with Mexico, he seldom talks about the fact that Native Americans, also known as Amerindians, American Indians, Indians, Indigenous Americans and other terms, are the Indigenous people of the US. There are more than 500 federally recognized tribes within the US, about half of which are associated with Indian reservations. The ancestors of modern Native Americans arrived in what is now the US at least 15,000 years ago, possibly much earlier, from Asia via Beringia. Native Americans were greatly affected by the European colonization, which began in 1492, and the native population declined precipitously due to introduced diseases, warfare and slavery. After the founding of the US, many Native American people were subjected to warfare, removals and one-sided treaties, and they continued to suffer from discriminatory government policies into the 20th century.
The natives are actually not Indians or Red Indians, though Christopher Columbus when he discovered the continent thought it was a part of India. The natives were later described as savages with the massacre, their way of life and culture being destroyed, though the horror was colour-washed through Hollywood films and comic books which described the colonization as an act of civilization. All the gold and other rich resources belong to them but the colonizers robbed these resources and marginalized the native people. In the aftermath of this, the US has little or no right to talk of a just, peaceful and all inclusive society. 
In Sri Lanka, we often refer to the indigenous people as Veddas but many believe we should refer to them as natives. According to a website, as the future chief of these people, Gunabandiya Uruwarige, 43, will face the challenge of preserving the indigenous communitys traditions while embracing inevitable modernization. Uruwarige has received training since childhood to be the future leader, he says. He did not attend primary school with his younger siblings. Rather, he had to follow their traditions of learning through nature. Although he is illiterate, he says it will not affect his leadership. The things that I learned from my grandfather and father are [more] useful and practical than things which others learn from the school, he says. Indeed we have much to learn from them and need to bring them into an all inclusive society.

Despite losing Shehan Jayasuriya, Thisara Perera and Lakmal, Mathews played a calm hand of 79 not out to steer his side to a competitive total in the Sri Lanka vs South Africa, 2nd ODI held in Dambulla. South Africa did a good job at the back end of the innings by giving away just 51 off the final 10. But the track is offering enough purchase for spinners. On a used-up surface, Sri Lanka would fancy their chances.

A top security authority had the other day secured an audience with a very high authority to air a grievance for early redress.

His complaint was that a certain political heavyweight has made it a habit to interfere in the administrative affairs in his office.
This person blatantly meddles not only with appointments, transfers and promotions but also with disciplinary inquiries in my office. He has become a veritable nuisance, the security chief had told the high authority.
He also had explained that he had found himself in a very embarrassing situation for the political heavyweight had once been his big boss.

Orator turns sissy when with girlfriends!
	

There is a young Diyawanna member who shines as an outstanding orator both in the august assembly and on the political stage.

A story that broke out at a lobby gossip session the other day said that his poetical skills are not second to his oratorical ones.
The story also said that the member is in the habit of sending regular phone messages carrying romantic lyrics and poems to his girlfriends and such compositions are so evocative of deep feelings, the recipient-girls are moved to tears.
Some girls, they say, wonder how could a person who uses such vitriolic language to lash out at his opponents, write such beautiful lyrics which could bring out such tender feelings of love and romance.
However, this Diyawanna poet turns very bashful when his girlfriends come to meet him, they say.
Referring to this Diyawanna member, a colleague of his quipped:
He is a poet and a lover in the night, a hard-hitting orator in the day and a bashful sissy when he meets his girlfriends!

## Title: Reactivation of death sentence
## Section: Opinion

Reactivation of death sentence
	
Maru Sira taken into custody

On the Day of the Execution the prisoner may order anything he wishes to eat

Only one of them had a swinging time (Edge) 
For the layman, the death sentence has been provided in the Penal Code from time of its inception in 1883. Once the death sentence is pronounced by the High Court of the Republic, the Attorney General and the High Court Judge, who pronounced the sentence, must forward their recommendations to the Minister of Justice regarding whether the sentence should be carried out. Upon receipt of the recommendations the Justice Minister will send his own recommendation to His Excellency the President. Upon receipt by him of the recommendations the President exercises his discretion as to whether the sentence should be carried out or whether to commute it to life imprisonment. If the President directs that the sentence should be carried out then the prisoner would be executed at a place, date, and time as nominated by the President. The execution is carried out by hanging the prisoner by the neck until he shall be dead.
The conviction and sentence are subject to two appeals- one to the Court of Appeal and the other to the Supreme Court. A death sentence case is always re-scrutinized by the Court of Appeal even where the prisoner doesnt appeal from the High Court. The High Court will not entertain a plea of guilty in a death sentence case and if the accused pleads guilty, the High Court will record a plea of not guilty and proceed to full trial. 
Bogambara Prison

Pronouncement of the death sentence
Before the sentence is passed, the judge addresses the accused and invites him to say anything as to why the death sentence should not be passed on him, and informs him that what he says will be recorded and forwarded to the President. This is called the allocutus. 
Then all the windows and doors are closed, the fans and lights are switched off, the remand guards take their stand on either side of the dock which holds the accused, and the Court Crier cries out- All stand! Silence while the High Court of the Republic pronounces the sentence of death! All those in the well of the Court must rise, except the Judge; these days one often sees the Judge himself standing up when delivering the judgment. But this is not necessary. 

The execution
The executioner is a Government salaried employee. On the day of the execution the prisoner may order anything he wishes to eat and it is delivered to him in the final cell prior to being taken to the Death Cell. He is allowed visitation by his near and dear. Christians are given absolution by a priest if so requested and the Buddhists may have a monk in attendance. So also the Muslims and various other denominations, may request their respective religious representatives for their final prayers. Thereafter he is taken manacled and chained and escorted to the death Cell with the Superintendent of Prisons in attendance. 
The execution is carried out by standing the prisoner on a trapdoor in the death cell with his hands and legs secured and then asked for his last words if any. Then he is blind folded and a lever pulled by the executioner at precisely the given time, which opens the trapdoor and the prisoner falls a distance of about six feet. The knot of the noose is placed at a precise angle on the back of the neck on the spinal column so that the neck snaps due to the impact of the fall. Selected observers, including close relatives, are permitted to be present at the execution. 
On the day of execution all the other prisoners and remandees are locked up and the gate of the prison kept open, so that the carrier of a last minute reprieve by the President can be rushed into the death cell without time consuming formalities even as the execution preliminaries are in progress. In Sri Lanka, the last death sentence was carried out on Siripala alias Maru Sira way back in the seventies. It is said that the death sentence thereafter was stopped due to various unpalatable stories that started circulating regarding the manner in which he was executed.

Gallows at the Prison

The law
As the law stands at present, those found guilty of murder shall be sentenced to death and in the context of the subject matter dealt with herein, those found guilty of drug trafficking are liable to be sentenced to death or to life imprisonment. 

The lobbies 
Much has been published in the newspapers and broadcast through the media regarding the pros and cons of implementing the death sentence. Much has been written about the lacuna in the law and violation of international treaties and covenants to which Sri Lanka is a party. 
The arguments of the anti-death sentence lobbyists, which include civil rights movements, political parties, some religious leaders, and idle philosophers can be categorized in summary as follows: 
That judicial execution conflicts with of international norms and treaties and Charters to which Sri Lanka has subscribed; that it is not a deterrent; that innocent men might be executed; that the main perpetrators are immune to prosecution whilst their underlings are condemned and executed; that in drug related crime, the drug lords operate freely whilst their underlings and other small time operators are prosecuted, and that corruption in the law enforcement and political influence often contribute to the commission of these crimes either as facilitators or as protectors. 
It appears that this sense of outrage is not quite universal. One finds academicians, religious leaders and quite a majority of Members of Parliament, advocating the reactivation of the death sentence. 


"On the day of execution all the other prisoners and remandees are locked up and the gate of the prison kept open, so that the carrier of a last minute reprieve by the President can be rushed into the death cell without time consuming formalities"


The lobby which stresses that the reactivation of the death sentence will have severe economic repercussions on Sri Lanka from the International Community and also violate the various treaties entered into by Sri Lanka. Where the question of deterrent is concerned, the statistics of foreign countries are not yardsticks to measure the deterrent suitable in Sri Lanka. Those averse to the death sentence claim that the root cause seems to be corruption in high places. 

Proposed Amendments to the law 
The countrys whole judicial system as well as in other democratic systems, rests on reasonableness and probabilities. There are no absolutes in anything. This is basically what is called chaos theory- where the probable present can predict a probable future, but not the absolute. Hence, the community works on probabilities and not on absolutes. Even the communist, socialist, and democratic systems misfired because in human conduct there is no guarantee that the equation 2+2=4 always holds true. So, governments, communities, nations, states exist on probabilities- so also then, does justice. For that matter, when one crosses the high way, there is no absolute that he will reach the other side. 
Having said this, to satisfy all (in all probability), I would suggest a framework of amendments to the criminal law for the consideration of the law makers and the general public: 


Writers suggestions
1. Trials by Judge without a jury be abolished regarding capital offences 

2. Capital offences be tried solely by a jury before a Judge 

3. A jury quorum be increased to 12 

4. A jury trial shall be heard day to day, and on no account, unless for compellable reason, be postponed, once commenced 

5. The jury to be kept together in isolation from the beginning to the end of the trial, with all reasonable facilities provided by the State 

6. State Protection be given to the families of the jury members upon request, during the course of the trial, or they be given the option of arranging for their own protection at State cost- the cost being reasonable; 

7. The verdict, to be acceptable, must be unanimous, or 10 - 2 

8. A copy of the Jury list be made available to each party at a reasonable time before trial. 

9.  Each Juror, on being selected, may be examined in camera by the adversarial parties upon oath with regard to his or her political, religious, racial, leanings and other areas that the Judge considers relevant as requested by counsel or on his own motion 

10. Any person reasonably suspected of intermeddling with any jury member be taken into custody and remanded without the option of bail and be tried summarily on charges of intermeddling, with mandatory penal sanctions upon conviction  

11. Any juror who is convicted for giving false evidence in the camera proceedings in (9) above be sentenced to a mandatory jail term after summary trial; the prosecution will not be subject to prescription 

12. Any witness found guilty of giving false evidence in a capital offence, consequent to which the accused is convicted and sentenced to death, be indicted for murder and tried by a jury 

(a) The offence will not be subject to prescription and he may be prosecuted at any time after the original trial 

13. Any witness found guilty of giving false evidence in a trial in a capital offence where he gave evidence material to the case, but, notwithstanding, the accused is acquitted, such witness shall be indicted for attempted murder without the option of bail 

(a) The prosecution shall not be subject to prescription 

14. Any sitting juror found guilty of having had any communication with either party prior to the trial, and does not disclose this in his examination in camera shall be charged for a contempt of court and after summary trial, given a mandatory jail term without the option of bail 

15. Any sitting juror found guilty of having had any communication during trial shall be charged for a contempt of court and after summary trial given a mandatory jail term without the option of bail 

16. Whether the accused appeals or not, a Full Bench of the Supreme Court shall review the conviction in every capital offence; 

17. In offences relating to drug trafficking, the option of life imprisonment be abolished retaining only the death penalty

Rekindling  the glory of Polonnaruwa
	

he ancient capital of Sri Lanka, the city of Polonnaruwa, the seat of great kings, will awaken to ancient glory once again with the completion of as many as 170 projects under the President Maithripala Sirisenas flagship, Pibidena Polonnaruwa on 1st, 2nd and 3rd of August this year.
Pibidena Polonnaruwa (Awakening of Polonnaruwa) District Development Project commenced on October 17, 2017.
The President, symbolizing the commencement of the project laid the foundation stone for a new classroom building at Aralaganvila, Vilayaya Madhya Maha Vidyalaya.
Under this ambitious development project, all sectors in Polonnaruwa including roads, electricity, agriculture, education, health and environment will be developed comprehensively.
When some areas in Sri Lanka were marching towards a rapid transformation during the last decade, I was lamenting as the representative of the people of Polonnaruwa due to the inability to make the relevant transformation for Polonnaruwa, President Sirisena declared.
Polonnaruwa will be taken to a rapid development through Pibidena Polonnaruwa, giving the benefits of the development to the people in this district.
Polonnaruwa, the second capital of ancient Lanka after Anuradhapura, is a World Heritage Site and forms part of the UNESCO-sponsored Cultural Triangle.
When the first capital Anuradhapura faced continuous invasions from Tamil kings across Palk Straits, in the seventh century, the city was abandoned and the capital transferred to Polonnaruwa or Pulastyanagara, the site probably of a prehistoric city named after Pulastya, the grandfather of Ravana, according to Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam.
King Vijayabahu I recaptured Polonnaruwa in 1055 and ruled until 1110. The most respected monarch who ruled the island from Polonnaruwa, however, was King Parakramabahu I or Prakramabahu the Great who ruled from 1153 to 1186 and is acclaimed by historians as the greatest of Sinhalese Kings.
Parakrama Samudra  the sea of Parakrama  remains a lasting monument to his memory.
Covering 2,400 hectares, this giant reservoir is the largest created during the medieval period. It has an embankment 12km in length. It is said that blocks of stone weighing 10 tons each were used in its construction.
The Polonnaruwa kingdom did not last long ending with Magha (1215-36). Threatened invasions from South India forced the kings to abandon Polonnaruwa and move to Dambadeniya.
After several centuries, Polonnaruwa is reawakening today under the development programme, Pibidena Polonnaruwa. President Maithripala Sirisena stated that the government has started the programme to uplift all people. More than 170 projects have been implemented under this programme and will be vested with the people during the first three days of next month. The Kalu Ganga Moragahakanda Project that was constructed at a cost of Rs. 2,300 million is almost three times the entire cost of the previous projects of the accelerated Mahaweli Multi-purpose Project. Water from both, the Moragahakanda and Kalu Ganga reservoirs will be primarily used to support agricultural needs to an area of at least 81,422 hectares. Water from the Moragahakanda Reservoir generates 25-megawatt power at the Moragahakanda Hydroelectric Power Station. The National Nephrology Hospital built at a cost of Rs. 1.2 billion, is a gift from China and the construction works commenced two weeks ago. The project is expected to complete within 24 months. The new Agricultural Economic Centre is being built at a cost of Rs. 50.2 million under the assistance of the Chinese Government.
A high technology museum in the country is being constructed in Polonnaruwa. 18 classroom buildings are being constructed at the Al-Ameen Muslim College, Senapura with the assistance of the security forces.


170 Development Projects in Polonnaruwa District to be declared open during 1  3 August 2018

A total of Rs. 60 billion in investments in the development of infrastructure and livelihoods.

Sex abuse endemic in the British aid sector...: UK MPs
	

Sexual abuse is endemic in the aid sector because of a boys club attitude in male dominated charities, MPs warn. 
In a damning report, they said a macho environment contributed to the sort of atmosphere where sexual exploitation was tolerated. 
The Commons international development committee accused the aid sector of complacency verging on complicity over the abuse scandal.

It highlights failings relating to both the recipients of aid and attacks on charity workers. 
It found the delivery of help to people in crisis had been subverted by sexual predators, with only superficial action taken to tackle it. 
Deluded charity bosses were engaged in a culture of denial  exhibiting more concern for good PR than for victims. 
MPs highlight that a lack of barriers makes aid an attractive sector for people wishing to exploit others. 
The report, Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in the Aid Sector, follows the exposure of abuse by Oxfam aid workers in Haiti in 2011. Among devastating conclusions, it found:Oxfam was more concerned about risk to its reputation than the danger recipients of aid would be abused; 
Charities and the Department for International Development ignored reports of sexual abuse going back almost two decades;

The United Nations is still in denial about abuse by its staff, some of whom have immunity from prosecution; 
Abuse against aid workers themselves  including rape  may be more prevalent than previously thought; 
Whistleblowers are afraid to speak out for fear of losing their jobs. 
The MPs demanded a boost to the powers of the Charity Commission, with the appointment of a new independent aid ombudsman.

Oxfam boss paid teenage girls for sex in Haiti
UK, (Daily Mail),- In the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Oxfam sent a team of 230 to help the homeless and starving. 
Within months, allegations surfaced of senior staff using prostitutes  some of whom may have been under 18. 
Roland van Hauwermeiren, head of the charitys Haiti mission, was accused of paying teenage girls between 70 and 140 a time for sex at his hilltop villa known as the Eagles Nest. 
Former staff told the Mail earlier this year that Mr van Hauwermeiren, a 68-year-old Belgian, loved young girls. Instead of being dismissed, he was offered a deal to resign if he co-operated with the investigation.

Sri Lanka Telecom, Super Platinum Sponsor for the Batticaloa Emergency and Accident Project
The newly built Emergency and Trauma Unit at the Teaching Hospital Batticaloa was declared open recently by the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Dr. Rajitha Senaratne. Sri Lanka Telecom PLC is the Super Platinum Sponsor of this project, having invested an amount of USD 300,000 for the project.
The Project Batticaloa Emergency and Accident Project (BEAP ) was initiated with the vision of building a fully equipped emergency and trauma unit at the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital that is capable of handling the large number of patients that seek treatment at the hospital each day. The Teaching Hospital treats approximately 700 patients per day. The existing facilities of the hospital were grossly inadequate to provide care to the 2 million plus population that live and seek medical attention not only in Batticaloa itself but also around the region including Trincomalee, Polonnaruwa as well as Ampara.
Mr. P.G. Kumarasinghe Sirisena, Chairman of the SLT Group gave his comments about the opening of the newly built unit, saying, We are honoured to have been a part of this noteworthy cause, the BEAP Project. As the Super Platinum Sponsor of the project, we have invested a large sum in this, but I believe its money well spent. We are truly glad to see the fruits of our investment - the envisioned Emergency and Trauma Unit being successfully completed and opened to the public, and the people in the region now being able to receive high quality medical care and treatment at the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital.
We thank and appreciate the Foundation Supporting a National Trauma Service in Sri Lanka for their commitment and hard work to see this project through to its completion and we also thank them for giving us this opportunity to be a part of this noble cause, added Mr. Sirisena.

THE CIRCUS NEVER ENDS!!!
	

he circus never ends, it only keeps getting better!!! It plays to different tunes, is sometimes spread countrywide, sometimes concentrated in small areas, the characters are different, but the antics are always the same!!! Which sucker can be duped and how Adding to all the examples we gave of how the public of this country is duped, we now have to take this even further!!! We are told that in addition to the bus conductors, fishmongers, vegetable vendors etc., there exists a racket on RELOADS!!! These Reloads are priced at Rs. 49/- and 99/- and on tendering a 50/- or 100/- note, you can rest assured that the balance 1/- belongs to the vendor!!! In addition, we pay tax, telecom levy etc.!!! For what purpose do we have a CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT ARE THEY WAITING FOR THE PUBLIC TO COMPLAIN TO TAKE ACTION Are they not supposed to be PROBING THESE RACKETS OR ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO JUST LET THEM HAPPEN, AS THEY DO NOW
Recently, when the price of gas went down, some places did not put their prices down and the excuse was that they had not been officially notified that the price was reduced!!! Conversely, had the price of gas gone up, the consumer would have immediately been made to pay the increased price!!!


Matter of ethics
ack to one of my favourite subjects: EDUCATION!!! Apparently, the Grade 5 Scholarship and A/Level Examinations were going to be hijacked but the Prez had for once put his foot down with a firm hand and the strike was called off!!!
The exams were targeted and the kids were in danger of not being able to sit their exams!!! THANKS TO THE TIMELY INTERVENTION OF THE PRESIDENT, THIS WAS RESOLVED, BUT THE QUESTION IS WOULD THEY STILL GO AHEAD AT A LATER DATE ARE THESE THE RESPONSIBLE HUMAN BEINGS THAT WE HAVE ENTRUSTED OUR CHILDREN TO

Snails pace
rafting of the new Constitution is in LIMBO, like everything else!!! Everything legal is always consigned to the back burner!!! We are continually reading that some case or hearing is postponed, important legal issues to be taken up at a later date!!! Cases that are taken up always POSTPONED, WHAT KIND OF A LEGAL SYSTEM DOES THIS COUNTRY HAVE DO WE LACK THE COURAGE OR THE KNOWLEDGE TO BRING A CASE TO CONCLUSION


Behold, this is Bhutan
friend from Bhutan shared a shining example of a country free of corruption and pollution and I would like to draw comparisons, where possible, to our country!!! How did Bhutan become the happiest country in the world Simple, the people of Bhutan were taught to realize and understand that money cant buy happiness!!! So, while globalization and industrialization engulfed the rest of the world, Bhutan paid special attention to its resources and began to conserve instead of over using!!! Unlike other countries and ours especially, the young King of Bhutan and his father before him made happiness and contentment of the people, the ultimate Yardstick!!! Have we ever undergone such a beautiful experience
Perhaps in the days of the Senanayakes and the Kotelawalas, who loved their country and her people!!! Bhutan has a sustainable economic growth because its people are taught that economic growth does not come at the expense of culture and the environment!!!
Our forests have been raped and still continue to be raped while Forest Conservation turns a blind eye!!! The Monarchs of Bhutan are not obnoxiously wealthy!!! Their current King lives in a modest house in Thimpu!!! Could MODEST be applied to the palaces and grandiose apartments used by our leaders who are supposedly SERVING THEIR COUNTRY The young King of Bhutan has used the Constitution to impose democracy and has even given the people the right to impeach him!!! We are entitled to ask what happened to the EXECUTIVE PRESIDENCY that was supposed to be abolished in 100 days
The father of the King of Bhutan introduced their GNP (which in this instance means Gross National Happiness) to the Constitution of Bhutan!!! The Government carries out surveys every year to take stock of peoples lives and standards of living!!! They then implement rules and policies to make things better!!! When in the recent history of our country has this been carried out EVER

Happiness in Bhutan
n Bhutan, the value of happiness has been imbibed by Buddhist culture, tradition and eventually by the Government!!! To our knowledge, when has the Government of this country, except in days of yore, contributed to the happiness of its people through Buddhist culture!!! Buddhist culture has been desecrated to the extent where the Government has even offered to pay the hotel bills of the Buddhist monk who absconded mnage a trois and was caught on camera by Ethalaya swimming with dark glasses and other intimate poses with the damsels concerned!!! This monk is from an illustrious temple down south covered with milk but the guy has gone to town no holds barred!!! Covering up for the monk can bring the votes the government will desperately need!!!

Bio-diversity hot-spot
pparently, Bhutan keeps their people happy by giving them free education, not education that they have to pay astronomical donations for and each outstanding student is given a free college education too!!! Additionally, they get free electricity and subsidized LED lights to help citizens and conserve energy!!! Also free medical treatment and medication!!! When and where have we had such magnanimous gestures bestowed on us The Government has partnered with Nissan to arrange the use of electric cars to cut out vehicle pollution!!! By fiercely protecting its environment, Bhutan is now one of the few remaining biodiversity hot-spots in the world!!! It is not just a carbon neutral country but a carbon negative one!!! Bhutans forests absorb more CO2 emissions than they actually produce!!! By allowing India to invest in its hydropower it has developed the fastest growing GDP in the world!!!

Individual Greed our bane
ll this shows us that when a country and its Leaders are prepared to make wise decisions in the interests of their country and its people, the country and the people will naturally flourish!!! However, when decisions are taken to subjugate the country and pamper to individual interests and greed, no country in the world can flourish!!! It would do our country and our leaders an immense amount of good to take some lessons from Bhutan, it is something this country so desperately needs!!!

The history behind Aluthnuwara  and Kandy pageants
	
The tusker carrying the emblem in procession

luthnuwara Perahera (Pageant) concluded on Sunday (July 28) afternoon. The conclusion of this pageant marked the beginning of the festivities in the hill country. Very few people know that it was from Aluthnuwara that the Kandy Esala Pageant originated. 
Aluthnuwara has retained its old charm and is surrounded by hills and stretches of paddy lands. One cant forget the village life here, which is also much talked about. Its the pageant which gives the place life and without it the city would resemble a sleepy town. However, the visits to the Dedimunda Devale continue throughout the year. The only place where there are changes is the area dedicated for God Dedimunda the Devale. He is much worshiped by thefolks in the Kandyan hills. They believe that he surveys and rules the area. This ancient pageant has a special significance culturally and socially. The pageant alsohas a religious significance. It also signifies the interaction that existed between the Kandyan Kingdom and the low country. This interaction is visible even today with the inclusion of Low Country dancers in the Aluthnuwara Pageant. There is no pageant in the Kandyan region without the participation of Low country dancers. 
Aluthnuwara during the olden days was situated on the cross road that connects with the path to Sri Pada (Adams Peak). 
The initial place which was dedicated to God Upulvan was the place under a huge mara tree. This place is right in front of the main building of the Devale. It is from here that King Senarath shifted the statue of the God, Devapathiraja Palikadaha, and the devale (Shrine) to the Kandy Maha Vishnu Devale. 

The rock on which the first Devale was built
God Dedimunda
The Devale situated at Aluthnuwara dates back to the period of Parakrama Bahu. But the present building, which houses the Devale, is said to have been built during in the 1700s by Molligoda Maha Nilame. The Devale is dedicated to God Dedimunda. Many stories are associated with God Dedimunda. One is that God Dedimunda is the son of a Yakshaya (Devil) named Purnaka and queen Erandathi. The other is that a Bandara from the Kandyan Kingdom became a God due to his merits in a past life, but attained the life of a human. The history of Aluthnuwara is not very clear up to date.
here is a school of thought that takes us to the origins of Aluthnuwara; a period before Parakarama Bahu. Around 1258, Parakrama Bahu II fell ill (the king developed an unsound mind ) when his Cabinet of Ministers led by Deva Pathiraja sought the help of God Upulvan of Devundera. It is recorded that Pathiraja personally visited Devundara and held a pageant, for seven days to bring blessings on the king, without success. On the seventh night of the pageant Upulvan appeared as a Brahamin. Deva Pathiraja was told that the kings illness could not be cured and this was attributed to a previous Karma (Sin). 
Deva Pathiraja indicated that his wish was to build a Devale (Shrine) at Dambadeniya, but following a request made by the Queens, it was build at Aluthnuwara. It was in this fashion that the Devale was built for God Upulvan at Aluthnuwara. In fact the present site, where once God Upulvan was cited, was known as Malwatte. The site was selected by the queen of Parakrama Bahu, Queen Sunethra and the Chief Priest of  the Len Vihare. At present its known as Galagama Raja Maha Viharaya. With the setting up of the Devale, the next important task was the installation of an effigy or a figure of God Upulvan. For this purpose a figure of Upulvan was carved out of a Sapu tree. The place from where the tree was found is now known as Sapugathkara. 

The Emblem of the deity Dedimunda is brought for the Perahera
Inaugural pageant
From this shrine a procession comprising elephants and dancers started. There is no indication or evidence of any banners being used during this pageant. Questions are asked whether this is the inaugural pageant of the Central Hills  
There is no indication that a pageant was held in the name of God Natha. The Natha Devale was the first shrine to be built in the Kandyan Kingdom. Subsequently there had been pageants for the four shrines in Kandy. However these were organised after Aluthnuwara pageant. 
The Kandy Esala Perahera received prominence after 1753. This was with the arrival of Ven. Upali Thera from Siam (presently Thailand). He arrived in the island to receive Upasamapada (Higher Ordination). The monk viewing the pageant of the shrine inquired from King Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe whether there was no participation form the Sri Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the tooth) in the Perahera. The King didnt reply this question, but on the following day added the Sri Dalada Maligawa section of the pageant. Thus a tradition began where the sacred tooth was carried at the pageant. A large number of priests participating in the pageant carried the sacred tooth. At that time there was no Diyawadana Nilame to follow the tusker. 
With the shifting of the figure of Upulvan to Kandy the shrine went into disuse. At present only the foundation of the shrine remains. It was only a few years ago that a lamp was installed for devotees to light. 

Basnayake Nilame Mahendra Ratwatte proceeds towards the Perahera
Blasting the boulder
Presently, Aluthnuwara is the abode of God Dedimunda. This God is regarded as the Prime Minister of Upulvan. On selecting the site close to the old shrine it was found that a huge boulder had arisen. So they tried to blast the boulder, but these efforts had no effect. They then prayed to God Dedimunda to break the rock. God Dedimunda, also known as Sudu Mal, could command Yakshayas (devils). This God then ordered the devils to break the rocks and was accomplished within a night. After the task was accomplished, God Dedimunda drove away the devils.
A part of the rock is significant with the ceremony where the Ran Auyadaya  (Golden weapon) is brought out on the final day of the pageant. The building is said to have been constructed by Molligoda Nilame as a offering because his prayers were answered. He prayed that he would not be banished from the Kandyan Kingdom.
However there are certain records which suggest that Pilamatalawe Adikaram constructed this building. The building around the main shrine, Suniam Devale, had been constructed by the Basnayake Nilames who were in charge of the shrine in the past. <U+200D>
The Maha Vishnu Devale and the shrine of God Dedimunda. at Aluthnuwara are headed by the Basnayake Nilames of both these Devales. The incumbent Basnayake Nilame is Mahendra Ratwatte.

The Music Competition of the year : Young choristers gain much experience in SA
	
The World Choir Games is an international choir competition organised by INTERKULTUR and is open to all non-professional choirs. Held every two years, the World Choir Games is an opportunity for choirs, both with and without international competitive experience, to showcase their talent and get together with other musicians and choristers to appreciate and celebrate music. The competitors of the 10th World Choir Games consisted of over 16,000 singers from over 300 choirs representing more than 60 countries who gathered in Tshwane, South Africa earlier this month. One of the choirs that were in Tshwane representing Sri Lanka was The Soul Sounds Childrens Academy Choir who, having excelled at the Asia Pacific Choir Games in 2017, were able to win a silver and bronze medal for the childrens choir and scenic folklore categories respectively which enabled choirs from around the world to experience Sri Lankan talent. 
The academy
The Soul Sounds Academy is the brainchild of Soundarie David Rodrigo, a pianist and musician whose passion was to introduce the beauty of music to her students. As a result of her passion for music and her many experiences as a performer and as a student of the Royal College of Music London, she established this academy to promote all forms of music, especially choral music, and to give children the opportunity to perform both locally and internationally. The World Choir Games in South Africa was the third international competition that the children of the Soul Sounds Academy have participated in. They have also been given the opportunity to take part in competitions in Wales and Indonesia. Apart from allowing children of all ages to enter the world of music through singing, the Soul Sounds Academy also exposes its students to various other forms of music by teaching them to play instruments such as violin, piano and guitar. 
The Childrens Choir
Out of the many talented young musicians at the academy, 33 children were selected through intense auditions and were given the opportunity to represent Sri Lanka at the 10th World Choir Games in Tshwane as the Soul Sounds Academy Childrens Choir. These choristers had to fit into a tight schedule which had many practices. This was also a challenge for the teachers of this choir as they had to organise practices for children from many schools who all had various other activities to attend to. However, with the help of the teachers, the parents and the children themselves the Childrens Choir of The Soul Sounds Academy was able showcase their talent competing against the best. As she was chosen to be a member of the Jury at the Choir Games, Soundarie was not able to conduct the choir as she normally would have done, but with the training she gave Dinushka Jayawickreme and Amandhi Caldera- two of the teachers in the vocal department of the academy- were able to bring the children to the present standard. Alongside their teachers, these wonderful young people were moulded by their artistic director Jerome De Silva together with veteran musicians Ramya de Livera Perera and Ravi Bandu Vidyapathy. With Soundarie in charge of picking the pieces to be sung and the overall music output, the team of teachers and instructors enhanced the music which the choir was performing. 
In South Africa
For the short time that they were in South Africa, the children were able to learn a lot from the other choirs and performances. Aside from taking part in the competition (which no doubt took up most of their time!), they had a fun-filled trip, which included a safari and sight-seeing. The children werent the only ones who had a learning experience in South Africa. As a member of the Judging Panel and as the Director of the Soul Sounds Childrens Academy Choir, Soundarie was able to learn from her fellow Jury members who were not only extremely experienced and knowledgeable, but also friendly and non-hesitant in sharing their knowledge. This was reciprocated by Soundarie, who as a judge, was able to experience and appreciate the different programmes, genres and tone quality. 
Music inSri Lanka
It is very obvious that the music industry in Sri Lanka is growing everyday and along with it, are the choirs that contribute to this growth. With the Asia Pacific Choir Games that were held here in Sri Lanka last year, the many choirs of this country have come forward and showcased their talents and given confidence to other choirs as well as gaining confidence themselves. Soundarie, whose dream has been to start a childrens choir, believes that along with the Asia Pacific Choir Games and The World Choir Games, the choirs in Sri Lanka have raised their standards. She also believes that the choirs representing Sri Lanka at The World Choir Games in South Africa  The Soul Sounds Academy Childrens Choir and the Royal College Choir  have given all other Sri Lankan choirs the opportunity to dream big and work hard to achieve what they may have once thought was unthinkable.The pride which this team of musicians has brought Sri Lankas not only because of their medals but simply by their presence at the World Choir Games which was the product of many months of extremely hard work which included the cooperation of the children, parents and the teachers who had to work around involvements in school and at work. Further, all the sponsors involved in the months of preparation have also been influential in making this a reality.  

Totally pop with Soul Sounds!

Soul Sounds is not an unfamiliar name to the music lovers in this country. Having recently entertained people with a Midnight Concert, which featured classical music, they take the stage again, but this time to entertain us with all pop music. Their next show will be held at the Lionel Wendt on August 8 commencing at 7.30 pm. 
Mostly famous for their gospel music, the girls of Soul Sounds along with their musical director, Soundarie David Rodrigo, continuously challenge themselves and are keen to expand their skills when it comes to singing songs of various genres.

The ubiquitous guest gets the cold shoulder!
	

There is a soft-spoken hardliner in the Group 16 who is a member of the black-coated gentry.

Now an ordinary backbencher, no longer burdened with a portfolio, the politico opened an office to get back to his old job. A good number of invitees attended the event and among them was a businessman-sibling of a very high political authority.
This sibling with a moniker that reminds one of a highly respected onetime leader of the country, despite his well-known family ties, is said to be a character rubbing shoulders with political heavyweights of all hues.
However, most members from the Group 16 present on the occasion had disliked his presence at the event and given him the cold shoulder. Some of them had, in fact, made their resentment known in hushed tones to those who organized it. They had later conveyed their sentiments to the former strongman as well, they say.

This place is being packed with political appointees!
	

This establishment titled as an authority is a major key undertaking in the State sector. They have suddenly started recruiting employees in hordes to it, they say.

As a matter of long-established procedure, only skilled workers who have undergone specific vocational training courses are normally recruited to this State authority. However, those joining the workforce here these days do not possess basic educational qualifications let alone the required skills. Most of these new recruits are from villages alongside the lower reaches of Kalu Ganga, they say.
As there are no jobs to be assigned to these new workers recruited far in excess of the cadre requirements, some new jobs have been created for them at this authority. Their jobs are connected to the mail every day received at the authority. Some are deployed for opening the letters, some others for jobs like recording them in a register, distributing them to various divisions etc. Some old-timers at the authority highly amused about this situation joke that the new chaps seem to be good at evaporating letters as well.
If the powerful politicos continue to plant their henchmen at this rate in this authority overlooking the sea, the day it is destined to fold up is not far away, say veterans at the place.

"Tighten the knot in one go"
	
We all want to live a fruitful life during this short life of ours. But some dont have the opportunity to live life to the fullest. Sri Lanka has struggled to reinforce the death penalty for a long time, but its ethical considerations have stood in the way. After the last execution, which took place in 1976, the death sentence handed to criminals in Sri Lanka in other words meant rigorous life imprisonment. However in 2004 the then Government once again decided to reinstate capital punishment for cases of rape, drug trafficking and murder following the assassination of High Court Judge Sarath Ambepitiya. Yet significant pressure applied by those opposing capital punishment has put decision making at a standstill. With the increasing rate of crimes and particularly the cases relating to drug trafficking, the Yahapalana Government is once again considering capital punishment as the ultimate solution for certain criminal offenses. Following the news about the enforcement of the death penalty, several people were willing to take up the post of executioner. L B Karunawathi, from Averiwatta, Katunayake, is one such person who has made a public statement conveying her willingness to serve in such a capacity. 
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Karunawathi shared her views about capital punishment and why she wants to become an executioner.

Capital punishment is the only possible way to teach them a lesson. As a mother Im sad to see innocent young children sacrificing their lives because of these culprits
But its heart-wrenching to see incidents such as what happened to Seya Sadewmi and Vidya from Jaffna. I want to stand up for justice. Where are the people who gang-raped Vidya

Back in the day we had to walk through an estate to reach school and we never encountered any problem. But today a woman cant walk alone in an area like that


L B Karunawathis residence

Q Tell us about yourself.
Im a mother of six children, but only five of them are living today. One of them contracted rabies after being bitten by a dog and died. Another child of mine is mentally challenged and I have travelled all over the country to treat him. But I failed. Now I spend time at home with my grandchildren. 

QWhy did you make such a controversial statement
That is because of the crimes that take place today. We have never heard of such incidents in the past. Capital punishment is the only possible way to teach them a lesson. As a mother Im sad to see innocent young children sacrificing their lives because of these culprits. 

QSo you are particularly interested in hanging people who abuse and kill children
Yes, but Im ready to hang every person who has done injustice to this country. 

QDo you know of anybody who has committed such crimes
No. But its heart-wrenching to see incidents such as what happened to Seya Sadewmi and Vidya from Jaffna. I want to stand up for justice. Where are the people who gang-raped Vidya If it happened to one of my children I wouldnt have been quiet like her parents. Parents send their children to school with much hope, but with these predators around, children wouldnt survive, and it breaks my heart. 
QWhat would you do if you get selected as the executioner
Im willing to take it up, but I know I wont get it, considering the fact that Im a woman, my age and other criteria that have to be met. 
QDo you think a woman is eligible for this position
Irrespective of gender, if a person has a strong mind to end the life of a person who has committed a grave crime, he or she should be given the opportunity. Even if I dont get it, I would like to ask anybody who becomes the executioner to tighten the knot in one go and teach people a lesson. 
QDo you think that enforcing the death penalty would reduce the crime rate
Yes, I feel that by doing so people would fear committing such crimes. This is the ultimatum. We all want to live, but there are some people who live even after killing another. I believe that those people should be hanged. 
QWhat do you think is the reason behind the increasing rate of crimes
I think its because of drugs, alcohol and other substances that make people high. Another reason is technology. Back in the day we had to walk through an estate to reach school and we never encountered any problem. But today a woman cant walk alone in an area like that. Those days we never heard of people arguing with one another. Life was very peaceful back then. 
QOne reason for children to face such unpleasant encounters is due to parents negligence. What is your message to parents and children
Both girls and boys need to be watched carefully. Always keep them in your vicinity. They have to be a priority. On the other hand, children shouldnt hurt their parents feelings. Be satisfied with what you have, study and fulfill their dreams.

Trace City:  Gotas concept  will be fully implemented-Harsha
	
The incumbent Government would carry Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksas concept of Trace City and would move towards implementing its second and third phase, Deputy Minister Dr Harsha De Silva said today.
Dr De Silva said that the concept should and would be taken forward so that knowledge-based, highly competitive employment opportunities would be created.
This 10-acre land where the Trace City is located was taken over by the Army during the wartime.
Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa renovated some warehouses and opened a knowledge park.
There were some IT Sector investments in this park initially and this Government developed it further. London Stock Exchange opened an office there recently.
More than 1,200 youth work in the offices which are located in this 10-acre land. Youth in software companies located in this land earn Rs 175,000 a month. We have to carry on with the project.
It does not matter which Government launched this project. We will not allow anyone to destroy the Trace City Knowledge Park.
Phase two and phase three will be done in Trace City. No one will approve the construction of a building for the Railways Department.
Minister Champika Ranawaka had not approved the construction of a Railways Department building. Both buildings will be constructed in the two adjoining lands, Dr De Silva said.
Focusing on the Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Zone Dr De Silva said Sri Lanka should get into trade agreements to avoid isolation.
If Sri Lanka failed to agree into FTAs with other countries it will be isolated and will have to face worse economic issues than the ones it is already facing, he said.
Regional Comprehensive economic partnership (RCEP) Agreement will be signed by November this year. Sixteen countries will sign it. These include the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members and ASEAN, plus six countries including India, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and China.
All countries in the Indian Ocean region will get into one group as Pakistan and Bangladesh will also join that group. Only Sri Lanka will be left out when that happens.
All countries in the Asian region had clearly stated that they will join RCEP, he said
He said no third party country citizens could come and work here.
No Singaporean or Indian doctor could come and open a dispensary in Sri Lanka under the Singapore-Sri Lanka FTA. However, he said inter-corporate transfers are possible under Mode 3 of the FTA.
This means a company which invests here could bring in managers and other officials needed for the company.
There is a clause which says if a Singaporean Company is bringing in managers such persons should hold one-year work experience in the same company.
However visa will be given only for two years. Singaporean experts such as architects could only provide pre-advisory services online under the FTA.
Imports will be subjected 35 per cent value addition. There is a list of negative goods for which there will be no free movement towards Sri Lanka. Mode Four is open in the FTA which Singapore had signed with India, he said in this regard. (Yohan Perera)

Tragic story  of betrayal  of a dignified service
	

It is not power that corrupts but fear. Fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are subject to it. 
~Aung San Suu Kyi

eylon Civil Service, later transformed into Sri Lanka Administrative Service, has been a dignified public service.
It functioned as part of the executive administration of the country in various degrees until Ceylon gained self-rule in 1948. Until it was abolished on 1 May 1963 it functioned as the permanent bureaucracy or secretariat of Crown employees that supported the Government of Ceylon (Source: Wikipedia).
Among the great men who peopled this strikingly distinct public service were Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam (The first Ceylonese Civil Servant), Shirley Amarasinghe, Raju Coomaraswamy, Sir Richard Aluvihare, M J Perera, G V P Samarasinghe, Bradman Weerakoon, M D D Peiris and Mahi Wickremaratne.
Outside the Civil Service per se, there were some outstanding public servants, who contributed immensely to the enrichment of the public life of the nation. Amongst them were Dr Wickrema Weerasooria, Lal Jayawardene and Warnasena Rasaputra.
All these gentlemen were not devoid of politics. They certainly would have had their personal political thinking and even might have had their personal biases right throughout their careers.
Yet, they did not go before the television cameras and openly canvass public opinion on behalf of their masters.
That is the legacy, in addition to their splendid work as public servants, which they left behind- a total apolitical demeanour before the public.
How does a political bearing of a public servant, especially during the time of an election, matter and how does that particular behaviour colour the public service as a whole
That is the question each public servant in the country is faced with today and what Lalith Weeratunga, Mahinda Rajapaksas Secretary during the eight years of their power, did during those vile years and what he is portraying himself to be is laughable.
Today Lalith Weeratunga is an alleged offender.
The allegation that he was one of the key people in the alleged abuse of State money for the purchase of the infamous Sil Redi in order to sway the voters of Sinhalese Buddhist ilk is a formidable one.

"After being the most dominant public servant during the Rajapaksa regime ..Weeratungas demeanour reveals a picture that its okay to look the other way when politicians resort to looting the Government coffers."

"Yet, Lalith Weeratungas assertions that the Rajapaksa Family is the sole political entity that could serve the needs of the people of Sri Lanka are a gross abuse of his office as a senior member of Sri Lanka Administrative Service (SLAS)."

How he would be plotting to extricate himself in courts of law is another matter altogether.
Yet, Lalith Weeratungas assertions that the Rajapaksa Family is the sole political entity that could serve the needs of the people of Sri Lanka are a gross abuse of his office as a senior member Sri Lanka Administrative Service (SLAS).
After being a direct beneficiary of the Rajapaksa rule and presiding over a public service that was subjected to total apathy and subservience to one single family rule, Weeratunga now resorts to justifying the rule of the Rajapaksas on grounds of speedy action and decision-making processes that were present during that time.
After being the most dominant public servant during the Rajapaksa regime, the inevitable message sent down the well-structured layers of the SLAS is one of Its okay to look the other way when politicians resort to looting the Government coffers.
The grave damage caused to the once-dignified SLAS is incredible. What is even more injurious is what he has chosen to do after his retirement from serving the Rajapaksa family instead of the country.
Whatever Weeratungas defence his lawyers are contemplating, his association with Mahinda Rajapaksa from the outset of the Helping Hambantota fiasco (From which Mahinda Rajapaksa was acquitted by the then Chief Justice Sarath N Silva, whose political allegiances continue to change as the countrys un-forecastable weather), has been solid and unbreakable. Nevertheless, Sarath N. Silva later apologized to the people of Sri Lanka for rendering a wrong decision in the Helping Hambantota case.
Rajapaksas have a very obscure and indefinable relationship with facts.
Having been comforted by the luxuries of absolute power from 2005 to 2014, they are still living in that exalted cocoon from which they seem utterly uncomfortable to come out.
This happens to all dictatorial leaders.
Chanakya, the sage of the ancient world said that the ultimate goal of all rulers should be to make their subjects free of fear. The Rajapaksas have done the exact opposite.
Having installed his own brother in the Ministry of Defence as its administrative and financial head, Mahinda Rajapaksa unleashed some of the worst and atrocious forces against the people who chose to defy them.
Lalith Weeratunga was indeed an integral part of that wheel of fear and terror. A complete public servant like M D D Peiris who was one time Secretary to Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike would have shuddered and handed his resignation if he were asked to look the other way.
Speaking of a public service of the past is utterly useless unless one needs to see where some constructive changes could be introduced and implemented. That public service is gone and is a derelict of the dead past.
The current crop of public servants who are dominating the upper echelons of SLAS might not be unrelenting in carrying out the government policies, but their commitment and allegiance to facts, accountability and transparency seem to have fallen by the wayside.
If there were one person who could be singularly responsible for such a sharp fall in the public service in Sri Lanka, it was Lalith Weeratunga.
His close relationship with Mahinda Rajapaksa made his visibility to the public even more distinct.
Lalith Weeratunga appeared on television and other radio talk shows during the last Presidential Election campaign.

"The allegation that he was one of the key people in the alleged abuse of State money for the purchase of the infamous of Sil Redi in order to sway the voters of Sinhalese Buddhist ilk is a formidable one."

They are indeed inexcusable. No public servant has done before and no public servant has done since.
Secretary to the President is an apolitical job. He may have his own personal political allegiances and likes. Yet, those who are chosen to that service, Sri Lanka Administrative Service, are deemed to have ridden themselves of that political garb when they execute government policies.
It is one thing to implement policies and programmes dictated by the Cabinet of Ministers who are politicians but to openly exhibit undiluted bias and prejudices towards a political vision is no embellishment to his professional career.
The writer has chosen a quotation from Aung San Suu Kyi, the charismatic new leader of Myanmar.
She couldnt have been more correct. The loss of power for Mahinda Rajapaksa was deeply felt by his immediate family and close cohorts. Lalith Weeratunga belongs to the latter category- close cohorts.
That loss of power and a faint hope of regaining that power could be all-consuming. There is no aphrodisiac more powerful than power, so said Henry Kissinger. That love of power has turned into a lust; that lust is driving them into a corner, not of reflection on their mistakes and erroneous decisions; it has turned their attention to a more immediate need- how to regain that power.
In that pursuit of lust, they are trying to legitimize and validate their wrongful decisions not in the way a scientist trying to rectify an entry of wrong facts into a scientific formula but as a hungry predator pursuing a helpless and unarmed prey running for its life. That is the tragic story of a dignified service to which Lalith Weeratunga belongs.

Understanding Velupillai Pirapaharans  mindset
	

ecent revelations on the detailed course of Eelam War IV in its last phase in 2009 made possible by Lord Michael Nasebys extraction of the contemporary readings of the battle theatre provided by the British Military Attache in Colombo, Lt. Col. Gash, permits one to chart specific strands of deceit and conspiratorial design perpetuated by the Western states led by USA and Norway with the implicit or explicit participation of a host of humanitarian agencies, such as ICG, AI and HRW together with other foreign funded agencies in Colombo.
This is a serious charge based on a series of articles that I have written over the years and recently consolidated after the Gash reports were made available by Lord Michael Naseby. However, a fuller comprehension of the specific strands of criticism requires attention to the character of the de facto state of Thamil Ealam set up by the LTTE in 1990 after its successful guerrilla battles with the IPKF from 1987-89 and its seizure of swathes of territory in the Eastern Province in 1990. 
The LTTE as an organization in its initial phases was imprinted with the demands of a nationalist insurgency in competition with other Tamil militants  all pitted against the existing state of Sri Lanka. Central to the LTTE was the mind-set guiding one of its key founding fathers: Veluppillai Pirapaharan (1954-2009).Pirapaharanwas totally committed to the goal of independence for his people, the SL Tamils. He was ready to lay down his life for this goal; while demanding the same depth of sacrificial devotion from all those who joined the LTTE. Their induction oath ran thus: 
Our revolutionary organizations purified aim is for a free society to achieve Tamil Eelam. My life and soul and all this I sacrifice to our organizations leader Prabhakaran. We fully accept that for him we will be very faithful and trustworthy.The aim of the Tigers  Tamils freedom. 
As one of his early comrades-in-arms Raghavan has indicated, Pirapaharan was inspired in his youth by the tales surrounding Indian nationalist heroes such asSubhas Chandra Bose and Kattabomman. Furthermore, he was an admirer of Adolf Hitler because of an erroneous belief that Hitler was the force behind the initial successes of the German Army. Military manuals by Sun Tzu and Clausewitz were also among his voracious acquisition of knowledge via translations or summaries provided by friends. 
As a youngster, moreover, Pirapaharan had been an addict of action movies from Tamil Nadu and the West. Ganeshan Iyer, one of the early Tiger leaders of the mid-1970s, has stated that Pirapaharan admired the exploits of Clint Eastwood in his role as uncompromising executor of righteous vengeance in several cowboy films. As Iyer indicates, this meant that Pirapaharan reached for the gun whenever serious internal disputes emerged within the tiny, clandestine core of Tiger militants working underground in the late 1970s and 1980s. At least two Tigers, one Michael from Batticaloa and one Patkunarajah, were killed (and he later directed one of his cadres to assassinate Uma Maheswaran who had broken away and formed PLOTE).

"Motives of retribution combined with tactical strike towards immediate strategic goals can be discerned in the assassination of both Neelan Tiruchelvam and Lakshman Kadirgamar"

As several Tamil militant organizations competed for leadership of the Tamil nationalist struggle, the Tiger leaders proceeded to eliminate or nullify TELO, EROS, PLOTE and EPRLF by force of gun and intimidation (between 1985 and 1991). Once Thamil Ealamwas in place in 1990, Pirapaharan adhered to the same tactic. It was now more than tactic. It was tactics aligned to strategy. Eliminate all leaders (including Tamils) opposed to Pirapaharan and eliminate leaders standing in the way of Thamil Ealam.
The concepts tactic and strategy are often used interchangeably in discussions of business goals. In the military arena strategy refers to the planning and general direction of military objectives, while tactics seek to implement strategy by short-term decisions  on the field of battle. Thus, in both arenas it is understood that the two concepts work in tandem: strategy defines the overall goal or goals; while tactics defines the minutiae of paths towards one or more of these goals. 
Pirapaharan and the LTTE leadership consistently deployed one tactic: target key military and political leaders within the opposing government of Sri Lanka and eliminate them by deploying suicide assassination teams, roadside bombs, snipers or in-your-face killers. They also intervened in parliamentary or presidential elections in the south by seeking to eliminate a candidate deemed less favourable to the Eelam cause. 
Let me initially point to the ultra-long list of assassinations carried out so effectively by the LTTE  a roll-call so long that I point readers to Wikipedia for edification. One can also speculate on the LTTE motives by differentiating killing-acts of vengeance from those seeking to promote future short-term or long-term goals whenever such a distinction becomes pertinent. 
The assassination of Rajiv Gandhi on May 21, 1991 is a conundrum of sorts. The killing was clearly designed to prevent the Congress Party from returning to power in India. But it seems to have been an act of vengeance as well -- revenge for the manner in which the IPKF did not meet the LTTEs initial expectations and then resorted to a war that saw the demise of several of Pirapaharans original comrade-in-arms. That the Tiger hierarchy and aides in Tamil Nadu and Lanka compiled a document entitled The Satanic Force in order to make their case against Gandhi supports this conjecture. 
Motives of retribution combined with tactical strike towards immediate strategic goals can be discerned in the assassination of both Neelan Tiruchelvam and Lakshman Kadirgamar. To Pirapaharan, of course, both would have been turncoats: Tamils serving the enemy. 
However, there were substantial strategic gains for the LTTE in each act of assassination. Neelan Tiruchelvam of the TULF was working with Chandrika Kumaratunga and G.L. Peiris to frame a constitutional via media that was designed to win over moderate Tamil opinion at a stage when Presidential elections were looming at the end of 1999. The assassination was at once symbolic and tactical. Its timing in late July 1999 was a stark reminder of the July pogrom of 1983 that terrorized so many Tamils living in the south. It was also a warning to Tamil peaceniks everywhere and a severe threat to the remnant elements of the old TULF. 
As a tactic Neelans assassination had a resounding strategic impact: it was one step in the process whereby the TULF of old disintegrated and converted into a pliant body of Tamil politicians in the south assembled under a new name, viz. the Tamil National Alliance  a body that even adopted the Tiger salute with its Nazi connotations. 


"Ganeshan Iyer, one of the early Tiger leaders of the mid-1970s, has stated that Pirapaharan admired the exploits of Clint Eastwood in his role as uncompromising executor of righteous vengeance in several cowboy films"


Likewise, the assassination of Lakshman Kadirgamar on August 17, 2005 was a tactical precursor to the renewal of war after the ceasefire of 2001. To comprehend this argument, one must step back to 2001/02. 
The ceasefire brought Norway into the Sri Lankan scenario in a major way with Eric Solheim as its key diplomat and Anton Balasingham as the LTTE magician. The LTTE moved on to the world stage as a de facto state in the period 2001-06. A media function at Kilinochchi in April 2002 was a world event. LTTE delegations thereafter visited western capitals and Norwegian ministers paid state visits to Thamil Ealam. 
When I visited Kilinochchi in late November 2004 to witness the maaveerar homage ceremonies held every November 26, several Tamil public servants whom I met were feisty and keen on war. Moreover, a chance ethnographic finding provided me with definitive indications that the LTTE was preparing to renew its warring path: the goal was to wrest an independent state of Thamil Ealam by force of arms. 
The impact of the tsunami of December 26, 2004 (which decimated the Sea Tiger capacities in particular) delayed this move to battle. So, it was not till mid-2006 that Pirapaharan and his comrades ventured into battle. From their viewpoint the ground had been prepared in the West for a military push to finalize the international recognition they had secured as a state in the wings.
One major obstacle stood in their way on the international stage: that forceful Tamil man Lakshman Kadirgamar. A consummate speaker with wide-ranging international connections, Kadirgamar was a thorn in the Norwegian flesh. The sooner got rid of the better. Ingenious LTTE planning and a dysfunctional Royal-College Tamil household in the heart of Colombo 7 enabled a Tiger sniper to eliminate Kadirgamar on August12, 2005. This act of killing was a tactical ploy towards the strategic goal ofThamil Ealamthrough war in mid-2006  conceived with assurance and determination by the Tiger leaders as successful war.  That success did not eventuate in Eelam War IV was in part due to the failure of two other tactical strikes: namely, the assassination attempts on General Sarath Fonseka on April 25, 2006 and that on Gotabhaya Rajapaksa on December 1, 2006. A pregnant suicide bomber in fact penetrated SL Army HQ and wounded Fonseka; but he recovered and led the SL Army during Eelam War IV. The Sri Lankan governments success in containing and then squashing the LTTE in Eelam War IV (2006-09) was due to a constellation of many factors. However, the organizational and leadership capacities revealed by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and Sarath Fonseka were of considerable significance in producing this outcome. Thus, the failure of those two assassination strikes had a disastrous impact for the Tiger programme of war.
These two failures, ironically, support the thesis that Pirapaharans persistent resort to assassination was a tactic that was integral to LTTE strategy  even, arguably, to the degree of serving as a strategy itself.

US says committed to work with SL to combat human trafficking
	
The US is committed to working with civil society, international organizations, and the Sri Lankan government to combat trafficking in persons in the country, a diplomat of the US Embassy on Monday said.
Robert Hilton, Charg dAffaires of the US Embassy said this while delivering a speech at an event organised by the International Labour Organization (ILO) Office in Colombo in view of the World Day Against Trafficking in Persons.
Mr. Hilton said the US Department of State funds three grants in Sri Lanka with a total value of approximately $2.5 million.
These grants engage on a wide variety of activities including, for example, helping to strengthen the judiciary to investigate and prosecute trafficking cases, building an effective trafficking data collection and reporting system, and improving services and protections for trafficking victims. Our partners, complementing the ILOs work in these efforts, are The Asia Foundation and the American Bar Association, he said.
He said these activities represent a commitment by the American government and by the American taxpayer to the worldwide effort to defeat trafficking in persons.
These efforts, of course, complement and support the important work that the government of Sri Lanka is itself doing to address human trafficking. I want to commend the government of Sri Lanka for progress in areas like identifying potential trafficking victims and amending legislation to make it possible to collect evidence and statements from victims or eyewitnesses who are overseas, he said.
However, he said there ismore work to be done and encouraged the Sri Lankan government, including the National Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force, to make progress on the critical issue of prosecuting and convicting perpetrators, improving protection services to victims, and promoting safe and legal migration.
Sri Lanka is not alone, of course, in trying to tackle the complex challenge of human trafficking. As I said, this is a problem the US has as well. President Trump has made combatting human trafficking a priority for his administration. Combatting human trafficking requires a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary effort, he said.
