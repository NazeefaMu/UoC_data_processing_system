Blood bank to malfunction today as Doctors demand to remove its Director
	
A dispute between the National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS) Director and its medical officers has lead to a malfunction of the blood bank for the first time in the history, it is learnt.
Medical officers attached to the NBTS at Narahenpita to resort into work stoppage from today urging the health authorities to remove NBTS Director Dr. Rukshan Bellana from his portfolio.
The strike is to be backed by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) with the support of 42 Medical Officers (MO) of the NBTS.
It was learnt that Speaking to the Daily Mirror, GMOAs NBTS branch Secretary Dr. Senal Rupasinghe said due to the arbitrary decisions and alleged finance misappropriation of the director, NBTS MOs had found hard to carry out their duties.
Dr. Rupasinghe stated that the director was interdicted for nearly two years and ten months for allegedly slinging mud to President Maithripala Sirisena during the previous Presidential election and was not having a good service record.
He alleged that Dr. Bellana had arbitrarily purchased a bone marrow transplant machine, misappropriating a sum of US $ 1 million funds allocated for a contingency plan.
He said that there is no need to purchase such machine as yet bone marrow transplanting is not performed in Sri Lanka.
Dr. Rupasinghe also said that the director had allegedly attempted to award a service agreement for repair the freezers given to provincial blood collection centres at a cost of Rs 7.3 million per annum.
He pointed out that less than Rs. 1 million was spent to service the freezers last year.
 So far we have not requested the provincial doctors of NBTS to take part in this protest. If the health authorities remain silent over the directors arbitrary behaviour we will resort to islandwide action disrupting the entire blood supply to the country, he added.
When contacted Dr. Bellana rejected the allegations levelled against him and said the medical officers are attempting to cover up their fraudulent activities.
Dr. Bellana said that one NBTS MO was accused of several serious sexual harassment allegations and he had called an inquiry over the accused via the Health Ministry Secretary.
The accused medical officer is attempting to divert the attention and stop taking disciplinary action against him. Several nurses had given a statement that the said MO who is initiating the strike, had attempted to obtain sexual advancement on several occasions. The nurses are refusing to go outstation on mobile service with the said MO, he said.
Dr. Bellana said that the accused medical officer in conivance is trying to tarnish his reputation by spreading false information among the staff and remove him to carryout his dirty work.
He said four nurses, two Medical Laboratory Technicians (MLT) and a minor staff are scheduled to give a statement against the accused medical officer during the inquiry.
Dr. Bellana said that after he was appointed in December 20, 2017 he was able to minimise several misconducts that took place in NBTS for years which was the main reason medical officers demand his removal.
It was learnt that only the blood collection from NBTS Narahenpita will be disrupted with the work stoppage and the Peripheral blood banks mobile service will attend blood donation campaigns islandwide as scheduled. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Brexit: Foreign Secretary quits adding pressure on PM May
	
Boris Johnson has resigned as UK Foreign Secretary amid a growing political crisis over the UK's Brexit strategy, the BBC reported a short while ago.
He is the second senior cabinet minister to quit within hours following Brexit Secretary David Davis's exit.
His departure came shortly before Theresa May began addressing Parliament about her new Brexit plan, which has angered many Conservative MPs.
She said she did not agree with the two ex-ministers about "the best way to honour" the result of the 2016 vote.
The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Johnson's exit had turned an "embarrassing and difficult situation for the PM into potentially a full-blown crisis".
She said he was not any ordinary cabinet minister but was the "face" of the Leave campaign during the 2016 referendum and his departure would fuel speculation about a leadership challenge.
She said she had been told by a source that either Theresa May "dumps" the plan signed off at Chequers or "another minister will go, then another, then anotherandthen another".
The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU afterwards.
Theresa May only has a majority in Parliament with the support of the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, so any split raises questions about whether her plan could survive a Commons vote. There have also been renewed questions about whether she will face a challenge to her position.
Speaking in theHouse of Commons, Mrs May paid tribute to Mr Johnson's "passion" in championing a global Britain after Brexit and Mr Davis' work in steering through key Brexit legislation.
But she told MPs: "We do not agree on the best way to deliver our shared commitments to honour the result of the referendum."
PM Maywarned that if the EU did not engage with her plan, there was a "serious risk" of the UK leaving in March 2019 without a deal in a "disorderly" manner.

Can the SLFP be thrown out Sampanthan
	
Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader R. Sampanthan asked in Parliament as to how the new political party Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) could dispense with Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) founded by the late S.W. R. D. Bandaranaike.
Making his remarks during the debate on an adjournment motion, Mr Sampanthan, who is also the Opposition Leader, said the SLFP was sought to be dispensed with.
There is coming into existence a new political party called the Pohottuwa, or the SLPP, which is said to be comprised of - I am not saying, comprising of I am saying, said to be comprised of - even some senior members of the SLFP.
I want to raise a question in Parliament and raise it before the whole country as to how it can ever be possible for anyone to dispense with the party founded by the late S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in the 50s when he resigned from the then UNP Government and crossed over to the Opposition.
It was a party which he led, a party through which he governed, a party through which several of his successors governed in this country, how that party can be abandoned in favour of the new party that came into existence just a couple of months ago he asked.
Besides, he said the Provincial Council Elections must be held.
They are important, they cannot be delayed and they must be held early, he said.
But, before the Provincial Council Elections are held, to make the provincial autonomy meaningful, something that will effectively give power to people at the provincial level, the new Constitution that we are proposing, must be enacted, addressing primarily the three main issues referred to by the Mover of this Adjournment Motion: the National Question, Provincial Governance, Provincial or Regional Autonomy, Executive Presidency and the new Electoral Reform Process, he said.

Carry out a forensic audit to put an end to bond issue: UNP MP
	
It is high time that a forensic audit was conducted to determine the exact losses, which the Government had suffered from the bond scam and recover that amount from those who were responsible for it, a UNP backbench MP said today.
Losses from the bond issue seemed to differ from time to time. Therefore it is essential to carry out a forensic audit to determine the exact losses, UNP MP Thushara Indunil Amarasena told a media briefing.
He said a sum of Rs 12 billion belonging to the Perpetual Treasuries Ltds bank accounts have been frozen already.
If a forensic audit reveals that Rs 12 billion is the real loss, then there is no issue. However, if the losses are higher, the remaining amount should be recovered from those who are responsible and they should be penalised. There are some people who want to keep dragging the bond issue, MP Amarasena said.
He said it would not be possible for the Prime Minister to bring former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran when he returns from his current tour to Singapore, as he is not aware as to where the latter was residing.
The MP who referred to the New York Times story, which had alleged that former President had obtained money from the Chinese company, said President Maithripala Sirisena should show the same enthusiasm which he showed to the bond issue, to the New York Times issue. (Yohan Perera)

## Title: Coal power plants are ecological disasters
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 9 July 2018 12:02 am
Coal power plants are ecological disasters
	
Coal is the dirtiest source of fossil fuel. When burned it produces emissions that cause global warming, create acid rain and pollute water and farm land. Coal burning produces many pollutants. These are sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter (PM), heavy metals and radioisotopes. Pollution from coal  fired power plants lead to numerous respiratory, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular effects. Coal dust released during coal transport can cause severe and potentially deadly respiratory problems.
Coal combustion waste in USA is the second largest waste stream after municipal solid waste. It is disposed of in landfills or surface impoundments. As rain filters through the toxic ash pits year after year, the toxic metals are leached out into the local environment.
Pollution from particulate matter
The particulate matter emitted from coal plant (PM) has a very grave effect on public health. The main contributor to the particulate matter is coal fly ash, and minor are sulphate and nitrate Coal fly ash is the incombustible materials that is 20% of the collected coal  ash. Particulate matter causes irritation and obstructions on fine airways of the lungs. This leads to asthma and chronic bronchitis. Every four tons of coal burned produce one ton of ash. It is further estimated that one ton of ash can spread over up to 150,000 square km (60,000 square miles). Fly ash can travel up to 40 - 50 km in the down wind direction. It settles down subsequently causing land degradation, severe air and water pollution and diseases in plants and animals, including humans.
Under this coverage area the harmful substances have been detected even in the milk of cows. According to WHO, exposure to PM increases the risk of death from heart disease, respiratory diseases and lung cancer. A study conducted in USA found that the underground dumped ash (produced by coal  fired power plants) has contaminated ground water. The toxic contaminants include Arsenic and lead. Arsenic causes skin, bladder and lung cancer and leads damage to the nervous system. Local aquatic life is also disrupted due to the coal ash life cycle because coal ash also transmits various types of toxic contaminants into the local atmosphere which travels to other sites with air. The carried over coal ash is dropped and dissolved in ponds, lakes and rivers. A research conducted by Stuttgart University estimates that the air pollution caused by coal  fired power plants was responsible for 22,300 premature deaths in the EU in 2010.
Pollution from nitrogen, sulphur oxides
Modern day coal power plants pollute less than older designs due to new technologies that filter the exhaust air in smoke stacks. However emission levels of various pollutants are greater than the emissions from natural gas power plants. Pollution from coal  fired power plants comes from the emission of gases such as nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides into the atmosphere. These gases react with the atmospheric air to create acidic compounds, which precipitate as rain leading to acid rain. 
Pollution from heavy metals
Coal contains many heavy metals. Many of the heavy metals released in the burning of coal are environmentally and biologically toxic elements, such as lead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic, as well as radio isotopes. 
A research conducted by University of Stuttgart under commission from Greenpeace found that coal-burnt power plants were the largest source of mercury air emissions in the EU. It is stated that 200,000 babies are born each year in the EU with mercury levels harmful to their mental and neurological development. A 500 MW coal power plant produces 170 pounds of mercury per a year. A teaspoon of mercury added to a 25-acre lake will make the fish in that lake unsafe for consumption. Lead and Cadmium are toxic metals that accumulate in human and animal tissues leading to mental retardation, development disorders and damage to the nervous system. 
A 500 MW coal powered plan produces 225 pounds of arsenic per year. In people who drink water which contain 50 parts per billion of arsenic, the chance of developing cancer is 1 in 100.
Radioactivity and coal
Coal contains minor amounts of the radioactive elements, uranium and thorium. When coal is burned, the fly ash contains uranium and thorium at up to 10 times their original levels.It has been estimated that concentration of radioactive material is increased from 0.03% to 0.12% annually in the upper 30 cm. layer of soil in a radius of 20 km of coal power plants.
Retirement of coal-power plants
USA has retired 175 coal fired power plants up to 2016. Britain has built 30 gas fired power plants to replace coal powered plants. France only produces 4% of its electricity needs from coal fired plants and even then has closed down 7 coal  fired units. Germany is moving towards renewable energy sources and has announced that the coal power plant opened in 2017 would be the last such plant in Germany.Canadian coal consumption has been reduced to 42% since 2005. The decrease is because Canada is gradually stopping power generation from coal  fired power plants. China is moving away from coal and at present has the highest wind power capacity in the world. China will soon overtake Germany for installed solar power capacity.

"A 500 MW coal power plant produces 170 pounds of mercury per year
Particulate matter emitted from coal plant has grave effects on public health
A ton of fly ash can spreadover up to150,000 sq. km (60,000 sq. miles)
Burning coal contains hazardous biological toxic elements such as lead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic"
Norochcholai power plant
No detailed study of pollution from Norochcholai power plant is available. The silence from Universities and environmental agencies is quite surprising. We know that pollution in Kandy and Colombo and various water bodies are frequently studied and communications are submitted. However a report from an activist about the Norochcholai power plant shows the importance given to environmental protection. He states that the cooling towers ocean intakes have a screen that is intended to stop large fish and shellfish going through the pipe. However, a large quantity of shellfish and large fish are also getting caught and killed. There is a mountain of dead marine life stacked in the ash dump. If we are unable to maintain a filtering screen, there is no point in talking about preventing pollution control.
The future of coal power in SL
There is no future for coal power in Sri Lanka. People who have seen the effects of Norochcolai power plant will not allow a power plant to be established in their areas. If the government tries to impose this project by force, it will lead to riots. The government will be forced to close the project after large financial losses and irreparable political damage.

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) would resort to strike action after July 17 without pre-notice over several demands including delays to increase the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance paid to medical officers.
GMOA Secretary Dr Haritha Aluthge said the recommendations to update the allowance had been already made by the National Salaries and Cadre Commission and the Health Ministry.
He said that in a meeting held on June 7, Finance Ministry Secretary had agreed to respond the proposal within two weeks period but no official response was made yet.
Also, Dr Aluthge said the medical officers concerned of the impact to the professionals via the new Inland Revenue Act and it had suggested some amendments to the Act.
He further explained that the Government decision to increase salaries for selected fields such as judiciary sector had violated the national policy on salaries and it had created injustice to other state employees including medical officers.
The GMOA had given a period of one week starting today to authoritys to respond to the issues pertaining to the medical officers.
The GMOA executive committee had unanimously decided to resort to strike action at any time in the week after July 17 if the authorities failed to resolve the given matters. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

## Title: Govt. urged to take  urgent action to rescue  Tea Industry
## Section: Opinion

Govt. urged to take  urgent action to rescue  Tea Industry
	
There was a good response to our article on the plight of the Tea Industry. We are also glad that at the Annual General Meeting of the Tea Traders Association, there were two addresses on How to face the future of the Industry. Problems facing it have been identified but it is pathetic that like in other crucial matters the government lacks the urgency needed and its lackadaisical attitude further aggravating the situation.
Useful suggestions were made by Minister Harsha de Silva at the said meeting. He recounted that before the advent of the Tea plantations to Sri Lanka, coffee plantations were doing extremely well. A mysterious blight dealt a deadly blow to coffee plantations. But in this advanced age of scientific findings, the recurring of such a blight is extremely remote Even if it surfaced there are remedies available to counter such a disaster. It is therefore essential that the government takes a firm decision to return to coffee cultivation specially in the mid country where the tea plantations are facing numerous problems. It has been pointed out that the Tea Research Institute [TRI] failed to take this initiative. It is suggested that the TRI sub Station at Hantana can easily be used as the Reach Centre for Coffee plantations. There is a very lucrative market for coffee allover the world.

"Appointments made to the all-important governing body of the tea Industry were highly questionable and lacked its standards"
Attention has also been drawn by the minister to use the prestigious brand name Ceylon Tea to aggressive marketing. Here the Traders Association is tight-lipped. They say they cannot conduct aggressive campaigning under our brand name, since we use Indian Tea to blend with our teas. Some countries having realized that quality Sri Lankan tea is being blended with teas from other countries, have imposed restrictions saying that tea imported from Sri Lanka should have at least 51% locally produced Tea.
When there are no issues arose in marketing the entire production, one cannot justify the intention of a section of the Tea Traders Association for lobbying for the import of Indian Tea. We have already pointed out that this was as disastrous, treacherous, anti-national and disgraceful. Here again the government shows its inability to make firm decision. The decision to ban importing Indian Tea must be taken without any further delay.
It is urged that there should be an aggressive marketing campaign not only for tea but for all export products. The High Commissions and Embassies should be criticized for not doing enough in this respect. Are the Tea Centres in potential tea-importing countries functioning effectively When was the last Sri Lanka TEA Week held It is suggested that the Export Development Board should get actively involved in organizing such Tea-weeks in major tea importing countries in the world.
Another important issue raised by the Tea Traders Association Chairman was about the Governments indecision to lift the ban on importing glyphosate, since this particular weedicide accounts for kidney diseases in the country. Although sufficient evidence was being placed before the government that glyphosate was not the cause for renal disorders, the ban still stands. The country has suffered a colossal revenue loss due to the crop failure for not using the chemical. Fingers pointed at the President for his inaction to lift the ban. He was urged to do so by a politician-prelate who does not know what he talks about. The government should act fast to salvage this crisis-ridden industry.

"The decision to ban importing Indian Tea must be taken without any further delay"
However, the Tea Board has made firm decision to embark on an aggressive task-oriented marketing programme. Though the Tea Board Head has announced that there would be a marketing campaign in Russia and Japan, there was no indication about a tangible marketing campaign in the European Union countries to reap benefits from GSP+ facility. Minister Harsha de Silva provided statistics to show how China and Kenya had overtaken Sri Lanka. He lamented that in 2016, Sri Lanka accounted for only 3.05% of imported tea to UK while to Pakistan it stood at 2.13%. At the same time Kenya supplied 36% of imported tea to UK and a whopping 60% to Pakistan. These were earlier dominated by Sri Lankan tea.
All sectors and players involved in Tea Industry must unite and enforce the discipline need not be adopted, which should emphasize the factory floor to reduce the percentage of refuse tea, adopt steady plucking norms to ensure that only tender leaves need to be plucked. The Advisory wing of the TRI has a vital role to play in these areas. We were told that a scissor has been introduced to pluck tea. But it was not clear whether it had brought any success
It has been pointed out by some plantation companies that the OIC attached to the TRI in Ratnapura was doing a yeoman service.

"SL suffered a colossal revenue loss due to the crop failure for not using glyphosate as weedicide"

But this appears to be the exception rather than the rule. Some who responded stated that if one were to visit the TRI at St. Coombs, Ratnapura, one could see the deterioration it suffers. We were also told that the salaries paid to the so-called researchers were not competitive and therefore, many of them are leaving the country in search of greener pastures.
We hear the Directors remuneration at TRI is far below, compared to the ailing head of the national carrier whose earnings are several times higher than the formers. Here again, it is up to the subject minister to intervene and deliver some justice. Meanwhile, some lamented that appointments made to the all-important governing body of the tea Industry were highly questionable and lacked its standards.
If the Tea Industry is to survive, all concerned sectors must unify to find a salvation to this limping industry. It has been noted that the TRI has not recruited a Botanist for the past 20 years!

GRAMMAR FOR COMMUNICATION: Fulfilment of a long-felt need in ELT
	
Parvathi Nagasundarams name is well known among English teachers in Sri Lanka, particularly for her active contribution in uplifting the quality of English language teaching at the national level. Her latest book, GRAMMAR FOR COMMUNICATION, a fulfilment of a long-felt need in the field of English language teaching, is equally useful to both the students and teachers of English.
The most striking feature of the book is its explanation of grammar structures and rules in a step-by-step building process, along with lots of opportunity for practice through varied exercises.
It includes all areas of English grammar that a student should master in order to express himself/herself correctly and appropriately in communication. In other words, the book uses a grammar-based approach integrated with communicative methods to boost the development of speaking, reading and writing skills. Full answer key at the back of the book helps learners identify which areas of English grammar they need to improve further.
Most of all, the book is written in a very simple, user-friendly, accessible language; grammar points are arranged in a logical sequence and presented in an elegant style. In fact, the book has established itself as a rich educational experience for students of English as well as for teachers of English.In my opinion, this is the first of its type published in Sri Lanka, which provides comprehensive explanations of all areas of English grammar followed by a wide range of exercises to reinforce each grammar point. Evidently, books on English grammar are too numerous, yet few are written keeping in mind the practical needs of students.
It can often be hard to find reliable, user-friendly grammar books. Most of these grammar books frequently are incomplete and geared towards teaching very specific concepts. But GRAMMAR FOR COMMUNICATION is unique for a number of important reasons.
First, the primary goal of this book is to enable students to communicate effectively in the English language based on the mastery of necessary English language structures as well as to help them develop the English language skills necessary to be able to speak, read and write in various communicative contexts. Second, when selecting the topics, themes, examples and exercises to be included in the book, the author has taken into account the communicative needs of students. The hands-on and highly practical nature of the book is also reflected in the fact that each unit contains many examples from authentic situations.

Full answerkey at theback ofthe bookhelps learners


Grammar points are introduced with explanations in simple English, along with illustrative examples where necessary and exercises are provided in order to assist the learners in mastering each grammar point, which will be extremely useful for self-study and for classroom use. Third, the book provides a comprehensive elaboration of word-phrase-clause-sentence level organization of grammatical elements in very simple language. The book is both descriptive and prescriptive in character. It provides the fundamental concepts of grammatical elements required for understanding the core of the grammatical system. Each chapter is devoted to elaborate one aspect of grammar: nouns, verbs, adjectives adverbs, conjunctions, determiners, pronouns, prepositions, tenses, voice, reported speech etc., giving details of structural and functional applications of these areas. Drawing examples from Sri Lankan setting, in itself, is an example of the reflection of the authors linguistic exploration of language use.
The unconventional but logical sequencing of topics could be seen in presenting discussions on verb-related topics such as tenses, gerund and infinitive, passive voice, and reported speech. A practical blend of the most useful elements of both traditional and communicative grammar, the book, on the whole, emphasizes both the use and usage of language.
Clear, concise, and packed with lively examples, GRAMMAR FOR COMMUNICATION fills the reader in on usage rules for word classes, clauses, sentence types, passive voice, reported speech and many more. It is a quick reference for those with the occasional questions and an excellent primer for anyone learning the grammatical system of the English language.
Therefore, even though the book is primarily intended for students of English and can be used as a recommended book in any second language instructional setting, it is equally useful for teachers and lecturers of English at universities and other higher educational institutes. Those engaged in studying English for specific purposes such as English for Law, English for Medicine, English for Employment, English for Business and ordinary readers of English will also extensively benefit from the contents of the book: it is an ideal resource for everyone who wants to produce grammatically excellent language. Whether one is creating perfect professional documents, school assignments, or effective official letters, he will find this book indispensable.

"Those engaged in studying English for specific purposes such as English for Law, English for Medicine, English for Employment, English for Business and ordinary readers of English will also extensively benefit from the contents of the book: it is an ideal resource for everyone who wants to produce grammatically excellent language."
The success of the book stems from the professional background of the author who worked as a consultant at the University of Sri Jayawardenepura, Rajarata and at Sabragamuwa University. She was working as the Head of the Department of English at the University of Sri Jayawardenepura for over eight years. She has over fifty years of experience in second language teaching. In fact, she has taught at school, at university, at teacher training colleges and at trainer training institutes, which makes her the most experienced of English teachers at all relevant levels. Her previous book titled Essential Grammar; A Reference Book for Teachers of English was an excellent guide for teachers of English. Since the publication of the book in December 2012, over 7000 copies have been sold. This book priced at Rs. 800, consists of 417 pages. It is available at all branches of Sarasavi Book Shop.
The writer is Senior Lecturer in English at the Gampaha Wickramarachchi Ayurveda Institute, University of Kelaniya

India allocates USD 56 mn to discourage poaching in SL
	
As a part of efforts to keep Tamil Nadu fishermen from poaching in Sri Lankas territorial waters, the Indian government has allocated US $ 56 million to dismantle bottom trawling boats and replacing them with new deep sea liners, it is learnt.
This has been done consequent to talks with the Sri Lankan government on the need to discourage Tamil Nadu fishermen from unlawfully engaging in fishing in the Palk Strait.
According to sources, 513 applications had been received by the Indian Government as of March 31 from owners of bottom trawlers who wished to replace them with deep sea liners.
In India, a model design for the vessel has been developed by the Central Institute of Fisheries Technology and Cochin Shipyard Ltd after consultation with all stakeholders.
A global advertisement has been floated seeking Expressions of Interest from the boat yards for participation in the scheme. A total of 59 interested companies applied and 18 yards were chosen for the first phase. Letters of Intent were offered to nine potential yards.
It is learnt that construction work on two new fishing harbours at Mookaiyur and Kunthukal in Tamil Nadu are progressing smoothly to take pressure off Palk Bay. The Mookaiyur harbour is expected to be completed by March 2019. Work on the construction of a fish landing centre at Kunthukal in the Ramanathapuram District commenced in June 2018.
A scheme for the use of seamless communication for fishermen is now under implementation by Tamil Nadu Government with World Bank assistance. The construction of communication towers for this project is expected to be completed by July 2018. Over fifteen thousand 5W handsets and two thousand five hundred 25W handsets have been delivered and are presently being distributed to fishermen.
Additionally, trials of the transponders developed by ISRO using the GSAT-6 under a scheme proposed by MHA, GOI has been conducted in Tamil Nadu and Gujarat in collaboration with the Indian Navy. The Government of Tamil Nadu has identified 550 fishing boats to be fitted with transponders. Upgraded transponders are being installed in the fishing boats from various coastal districts of Tamil Nadu.
Capacity building programmes for fishermen for deep sea fishing using long line and gill nets are being underway with the help of CIFNET. It is proposed to give training to 500 selected beneficiaries (10-15 per batch) through CIFNET Cochin and Chennai. They will be given off-shore hands on training including training on how to use these instruments. So far 14 batches (193 fishermen and 4 officials) have been trained by CIFNET in Tuna handling and deep sea fishing, sources said.(Kelum Bandara)

Jeevan Gnanam appointed to take the reigns as SLASSCOM Chairman
	
Jeevan Gnanam, Chairman of Sri Lanka Association of Software and Services Companies (SLASSCOM

<U+F0A7> Doubles down on ambitious vision to grow Sri Lankan IT industry to 5 billion by 2022
<U+F0A7> Calls for industry to rally around innovative data science, AI, and start ups

Newly appointed Sri Lanka Association of Software and Services Companies (SLASSCOM) Chairman, Jeevan Gnanam commenced his tenure with the announcement of an ambitious vision to rapidly grow the countrys IT industry to Rs. 5 billion by 2022.

Speaking to a gathering of Sri Lankas most successful IT professionals, Gnanam commended the vital efforts of SLASSCOM and its leadership in laying out a strong foundation for the industry to commence a rapid acceleration in its growth momentum.

I am fortunate to stand on the shoulders of great men and women who have come before me - from Madu Ratnayake to Mano Sekaram and Arul Sivagananathan to Ruwindhu Peiris, Chris Canekeratne to Tony Weerasinghe. All of them have contributed significantly in their own rights and dared to make a difference. So it is with cautious apprehension that I take over as Chairman full well knowing that these are big shoes to fill, knowing the decisions I make will have reverberations over industries and generations henceforth.

I promise to carry this important legacy forward and explore every opportunity for SLASSCOM and the nation to grow. We are fortunate to have some of the brightest and most progressive minds in the country behind SLASSCOM and as a nation, I think we can see that the opportunities are almost palpable, and I believe in my core that our Rs. 5 billion target is achievable by 2022, Gnanam stated.
Moving forward, he called for the industry to rally around a 5-point agenda focused around developing local capacity for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, building a culture of innovation across the industry, economy and society, supporting start-ups, the promotion of regional integration internationally and locally, and the commencement of selective skilled employment immigration programmes in order to facilitate invaluable knowledge transfers.

Sri Lankas services industry for the longest time has relied on two main pillars of excellence: Software Development and Finance & Accounting. This was primarily possible because of the large number of developers and finance and accounting graduates we had. However, I believe it is imperative that we now shift our mindset to focus on tomorrows jobs.

Particularly with the large number of statisticians Sri Lanka has, I believe with some up-skilling we can create our third pillar of Data Scientists and AI engineers. Similarly, as a chamber, we need to go beyond IT and focus on becoming a chamber of innovation. This year we include not only Tech or IT related companies but also ones that have a thirst for Innovation. Thanks to Ruwindhu and his team, we have already reached out to huge corporates like JKH, MAS, and Brandix, and are creating an Innovation Forum within SLASSCOM to takethis forward, Gnanam explained.

Elaborating further on his key priorities to take the industry to Rs. 5 billion, he called for the re-branding of Sri Lanka as a start-up nation, through the implementation of policy reforms to facilitate a more start-up friendly culture so that small tech and fintech companies are incentivized to experiment in a sandbox environment, while encouraging innovations like crowd funding to drive micro investments into the sector.

Gnanam also called for greater utilization of existing and future Free-Trade Agreements (FTA) to build bridges and deepen regional integration between public and private sectors. Similarly, he also called for greater regional integration within Sri Lanka by encouraging local companies to set up satellite operations in Tier 2 cities or towns like Negombo and Ja-ela while also exploring the possibility of selective skilled employment migration.

While I believe this might make me unpopular, Im not worried because Im not here to win a popularity contest. I truly believe if we want to become Singapore we need to think like Singaporeans. In many cases we simply do not have the skill sets necessary to make this transition within the country, and in such cases when necessary, we must look to importing quality personnel from neighboring countries to help fill these gaps.

There must of course be clear and defined policies to ensure that such processes occur without disadvantaging local talent, but we also need to ensure that we are open to new, global thinking. If managed correctly, I am confident that we can strike an optimal balance that will power this industry and the economy forward, Gnanam asserted.

Serving as a catalyst for growth and development within the Sri Lankan IT and BPM industry, SLASSCOM facilitates trade and business, the propagation of education and employment and encouragement of research and innovation through the creation of a progressive national policy framework.

Ondaatjes The English Patient wins Best of Man Booker Prize
	
The wartime love story, The English Patient authored by Sri Lankan-Canadian poet Michael Ondaatje, won the Golden Man Booker Prize in London, UK on Sunday night, the New York Times reported.
The one-off award, voted for by the public, commemorates the 50th anniversary of the Man Booker prize. The shortlist of five novels was selected by a panel of judges from the 51 previous winners of the Man Booker, which honors the best novels written in English and published in Britain or Ireland.
Booker Prize Foundations Chairperson Baroness Helena Kennedy in a statement said The English Patient is a compelling work of fiction  both poetic and philosophical.
As we celebrate the prizes 50th anniversary, its a testament to the impact and legacy of the Man Booker Prize that all of the winning books are still in print, she said.
Born in 1943 in Sri Lanka when it was known as Ceylon, Mr. Ondaatje now lives in Canada.
The English Patient, which follows the lives of four characters brought together during World War II, told through the morphine-affected memories of a severely burned patient, was a Booker Prize winner in 1992.
The film adaptation starring Kristin Scott Thomas and Ralph Fiennes won nine Academy Awards in 1997, including best picture.
Each of the judges for the Golden Man Booker Prize was allocated a decade from the prizes history and tasked with selecting the best work from it. The public then voted on this shortlist.
Last years winner, Lincoln in the Bardo, by George Saunders, was selected by the poet Hollie McNish. Simon Mayo, a novelist and broadcaster, chose the 2009 prize winner Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel.
The poet Lemn Sissay picked Moon Tiger by Penelope Lively, the winner in 1987. And Robert McCrum, a writer and editor, selected In a Free State by V.S. Naipaul, which won in 1971.
The English Patient was selected by the novelist Kamila Shamsie to represent the 1990s.
Ms. Shamsie said in a statement, The English Patient is that rare novel which gets under your skin and insists you return to it time and again, always yielding a new surprise or delight.

Seeking support to regain sight to start anew
	
With a promising career ahead of him, Sanjaya Sandaruwan was at the prime of his youth, when at the age of 27 life took an unfavourable turn of events for him. Sandaruwan is a sad victim of an acid attack following a love affair he had with a girl in the neighbourhood; a relationship that cost Sandaruwan not only his looks but also his career and a bright future.
A brutal acid attack was carried out against Sandaruwan in October 18, 2010 by his girlfriends family, who did not take the news of their affair kindly.
Since then, Sandaruwan has been walking in and out of hospitals and clinics constantly, seeking a remedy for both his eyes that were left blind and almost beyond repair. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Sandaruwan shared his sad plight, while seeking assistance to raise funds for the surgery on his left eye and find the capital much needed to start a small shop, which would immensely help him in the hunt to earn his daily bread and butter.
I had my first interview with the Daily Mirror back in 2014 to raise funds for the surgery on my right eye. Due to an acid attack that was brutally carried out against me, I completely lost sight in both eyes in 2010.
Since then, my life was completely shrouded in darkness for a period of five years. I had to go through numerous treatments including surgeries in the pursuit to regain my sight. However, I was not in a financially stable position to finance the major surgery that was recommended for my right eye. Following the initial interview I had with the Daily Mirror in 2014, I received donations from several generous donors which facilitated the surgery of an artificial cornea graft for my right eye. So far, this surgery is carried in Sri Lanka only by Senior Consultant Eye Surgeon (Cornea and Refractive Surgery) Dr Rajesh Fogla who hails from India and visits Lanka Hospitals once a month for consultations Sandaruwan said.
Since it is an artificial cornea graft that was conducted, Sandaruwan has been strictly instructed by healthcare professionals to refrain from engaging in any activity or be present in an environment, which would make his eyes vulnerable to harm through dust particles and extreme heat. Currently, he has been prescribed six expensive medications for his eyes, that needs to be taken every two hours and throughout his life. These medications are important to ensure that the new retinas will not be rejected from the body in addition to keeping the eyes moist and help avoid the risk of infections.
With an improvement of twenty percent in his right eye following a costly eye surgery medically known as the Boston Keratopersthesis Implantation Surgery that was conducted recently, Sandaruwan has rekindled his hope about gaining sight. Corneal transplantation also known as a corneal grafting is a surgical procedure, which helps replace a damaged or scarred cornea by a donated corneal tissue.
Sandaruwan currently looks forward to having his left eye operated on with a similar artificial cornea graft, which would enable him to gain sight in his left eye too. Hence, this is a gentle appeal by Sandaruwan to generous donors to fund the surgery for his left eye.
Since he is visually impaired to a certain scale, doctors have strictly advised him against being employed in any industrial or strenuous work.
Though he worked previously as a coach for a sports club affiliated to a tourist hotel, Sandaruwan now finds it difficult to support himself and his parents with a similar job profile. However, refusing to be a burden any longer to the society, Sandaruwan has planned on focusing on a self employment venture that will not cause any risk to his eyes.

"The estimated amount for the surgery on the left is valued at Rs. 520, 000; this is in addition to bearing the cost of Rs. 15,000 monthly for my daily medications and clinic routines"

With plans to open a small shop to financially support himself and his family, he appeals to the public for help once again to collect the capital that would be needed to open a small shop in addition to the public fund that he expects to raise to help carry out the surgery on his left eye.
I would like to thank all the generous donors who helped me in regaining my sight. I owe them tremendously for even the slight improvement I have gained in my right eye following the artificial corneal transplantation that was conducted on the eye. As I have been recommended the same surgery for my left eye and due to my financially unstable situation, I have no choice but to appeal to generous people once again to raise funds for both the surgery as well to find the capital that would be needed to open a small scale business of my own.
The estimated amount for the surgery on the left is valued at Rs. 520,000; this is in addition to bearing the cost of Rs. 15,000 monthly for my daily medications and clinic routines, Sandaruwan added.
Stating that currently a case has been filed against the accused in the Negombo Magistrate Court, Sandaruwan remains expectant that justice would be served to him. Donors who wish to help Sandaruwan overcome his sad plight could contact him on 071 2118745 or reach him at his home address located at No. 10, 5th Lane, Udasirigama, Lunuwila. If anyone wishes to financially assist him, account details are
given below.

## Title: Shifting power equations  and South Asias geopolitical uncertainties
## Section: Opinion

Shifting power equations  and South Asias geopolitical uncertainties
	
The South Asian region has been witnessing uncertain geopolitical dynamics around sore trouble areas like Afghanistan, Kashmir, shifting American and Russian relations with India and Pakistan and enhanced Chinese footprint with Pakistani and other smaller powers assistance. Major external powers which influence South Asian geopolitics are the US,Russia and China.
While the US-Pakistan relations have taken a nosedive after the Trump Administration declared military aid cuts, Pakistan is trying to offset the loss by courting China and Russia. China has already heavily invested in Pakistan to fulfill its geopolitical dream project  One Belt One Roadinitiative. Russia and Pakistan are inching closer as defence partners and trying to combine their efforts at fighting terrorism.
On the other side, the Trump Administration expressed its willingness to forge close defence ties with India and cast India in a more prominent role in its Indo-Pacific policy and Afghan strategy. Indias strategic relationship with Russia is at crossroads given pro-western thrust in its defence and trade policies.
Notwithstanding these shifts in relations, no clear alliances are visible. Russia would find it difficult to alienate India which has still deeper engagement in the area of defence as most of the defence equipment and technology still remain Russian. India has also shown interest in clinching new defence deals with Russia as it does not want to lose its old partner as the signing of a $500 billion deal to purchase the S400 air defence system from Russia suggests and it would also not like to see Russia-Pakistan relations grow at Indian expense.
The US, on the other hand, expressed its displeasure at the Indian move to buy air defence system from Russia  the state with which any major defence deals are to face sanctions under the American law.

"India has also shown interest in clinching new defence deals with Russia as it does not want to lose its old partner"
Similarly, the US would find it difficult to abandon Pakistan despite its displeasure and rhetoric castigating Pakistan for not doing enough to contain militancy against US presence in Afghanistan. Alternatives to Pakistani intelligence inputs to curb militancy and supply routes for NATO convoys are not already available with the US. US-Iran tensions and Russian caution against any heightened US presence in its backyard would drive the impetus of American dependence on Pakistan for supply routes.
Indo-US trade relations face certain challenges which according to many would make the strategic bonding between the two complicated. Modis Make in India initiative and Trumps America first policy only heighten the possibilities of more protectionism from both sides. Both have sued each other in WTO on a host of trade issues. Another factor that may detract from the strategic engagement between India and US is Indias willingness to involve Russia into its Indo-Pacific policy framework which runs against the American strategy of formation of a closed group of allies and containment of China. Kashmir is not only the bone of contention between India and Pakistan, it has so far been able to influence Afghan geopolitics, China-Pak relations, role of non-state actors like militant groups and more importantly, undercut possibilities of regional integration in South Asia. Ceasefire agreement along the Line of Control signed between India and Pakistan in 2003 has been continuously violated resulting in military and civilian casualties in both sides. Militant groups which perpetrated attack on the Indian Parliament and masterminded Mumbai terror attack are not brought to justice. This volatility in along the Indo-Pak border has only helped in intensifying tensions and external powers role in the region.
While China dilutes Indias claim to Kashmir as its integral part given the One Belt One Road project goes through Gilgit-Baltistan region, other external powers have preferred not to poke their nose in the bilateral issue. Given American suspicion of Chinese geopolitical objectives,China cannot pamper Pakistan beyond a limit and antagonize the US with which it has robust trade and investment engagements. However, growing militancy in Kashmir has found resonance in Afghanistan and vice versa.

"Shifting power equations and areas of tensions keep the region boiling and intensify arms race"
While the US thinks that Pakistan is not doing enough to contain militancy in Afghanistan and some in the Trump Administration have also alleged the Pakistani intelligence agency, ISI maintaining close ties with militant groups, Pakistan claims it has been doing its job as best as possible and has forced the al-Qaeda remnants out of its soil. Many scholars argue that while Pakistan has taken actions against the al Qaeda, it has not done so against the Taliban and Haqqani militant outfits. Some leaders in Pakistan believe that Pakistan cannot turn the militants into its perennial enemies as the US may quit Afghanistan after its job is done as it happened in the beginning of 1990s. India and Pakistan are locked in a blame-game each castigating the other in fomenting militancy against the other. India, while has been insistent that Pakistan harbours terrorist outfits like Laskar-e-Taeba in its different forms and uses them in fomenting cross-border terrorism, Pakistan has been alleging India of fomenting Baloch insurgency and using anti-Pakistani elements in Afghanistan.
Peace has so far been elusive in South Asia. Shifting power equations and areas of tensions keep the region boiling and intensify arms race. Peace and development can only be realized if regional integration happens and external players play a benign role instead of promoting their own interests.
Mutual distrust lies at the heart of undercutting any possibility of unification. When the incumbent Indian government under the leadership of Narendra Modi made a host of unilateral gestures and promises on Indias part to push the regional trade and connectivity ahead in the SAARC forum, most of these gestures were viewed as mere promises rather than concrete offers by the South Asian leaders and analysts given the historical perception of India by its neighbours. Smaller states in South Asia have been courting China to balance any perceived threat from India. Sub-regional groupings and ventures are replacing ties at the regional level but that does not augur well for the region.

Lord Naseby,the President of the AllParty British Sri Lanka Parliamentary Group,saidthis after reading the UK Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee report published onJune 28.
In a statement on Saturday, Lord Naseby said he was shocked and appalled that the UK should notonly condone Torture andextensive mistreatment of prisoners but actually in certain cases instigate it.
To me as a senior Politician of 44 years in Parliament whatever the threats may be, such practices aretotally unacceptable.As I read the report I reflected on the nearly 30 years of fighting in Sri Lanka between the forces of thedemocratically elected Government and the LTTE Tamil Tigers, the worst Terrorist Body in the World and proscribed in over 30 countries: a War that only ended on May 18,2009 with the total defeat of the TamilTigers, he said.
He said now theyknow the truth that the UK and the US were really guilty themselves of atrocities.
In my opinion thesetwo nations should now tell the Human Rights Commission in Geneva to withdraw the motion against SriLanka.After all it is already clear that good progress is being made to find out the missing persons, enact anew Prevention of Terrorism Act andcreate an independent Truth & Reconciliation Commission. Both theUK andthe US must know their actions total undermine the UN Charter andits Human Rights provisions, he said.
He said even now theydo not know the whole truth behind 'Detainee Mistreatment & Rendition' including torture asthe UK Government have refused to publish all the material they have.
One wonders why in terms of SriLanka the UK government refused to release the Gash Despatches in full.It is increasingly clear to me that these refusals may well hide data that in the case of Sri Lanka willexonerate the actions of Sri Lanka's forces or they will expose some actions that the UN/ UK/USA took toundermine Sri Lanka and their publication would in effect fully vindicate Sri Lanka,he said.
