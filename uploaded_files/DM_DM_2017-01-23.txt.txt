Barack and Michelle Obama  A lesson in grace and leadership
	
The American democratic process is flawed. Democracy means one person one vote. Democracy is at its best when all of its citizens vote. It is a travesty when in the worlds beacon of democracy, the United States of America, one candidate can win the presidency by losing the popular/people vote and winning the electoral college vote. But this is the flawed system now in America. In this flawed system, America has Donald John Trump as its 45th President. 
This democratic system also gives the right to 50 elected representatives of the people to choose to boycott the Inauguration of the new President. The civil rights icon Congressman John Lewis told the world that Donald Trump was not a legitimate president. Over 50 % of America did not vote for the new President. The reality is that the former reality show star and real estate billionaire is now the President of the USA and leader of the free world!!! Will he lead He wants to Put America First. The campaign is over. He did it HIS WAY and even danced with his wife at an inauguration Ball to Frank Sinatras MY WAY!! The dance is over. Now the hard work begins of above all uniting a very divided nation. Let us see if he can Make America Great Again. 
The Democrats produced a very flawed candidate with arguably the most powerful resume of any candidate for president in recent memory, Hillary Rodham Clinton. The overwhelming evidence of Russian interference in the election, the yet inexplicable behaviour of FBI Director James Comey, the clouds hanging over the Clinton Foundation, the unprecedented ugliness of the Trump Campaign and the distrust of and many missteps of Hillary Clinton, clearly cost her the election. She along with her husband Former President Bill Clinton now appear to have lost their lustre. It is sad. Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. 
With all the ugliness and bitterness in the Presidential Campaign, the world has just witnessed an unbelievably graceful transfer of power in the most powerful nation in the world. This is a lesson for the world. This would not have happened if not for the grace and leadership displayed by now Former President Barack Obama and the amazing First Lady Michelle Obama. Donald Trump was the man who for years questioned Obamas legitimacy as a President and led the movement demanding to see the Presidents birth certificate. Trump and the birther movement believed that Barack Obama was born in Kenya and not in America! Two weeks ago, I was invited to a mens Christian prayer breakfast in Southern California. The vast majority of the 200 participants believed that Barack Obama was a Muslim! How could Obama embrace Donald Trump who addition to questioning his legitimacy as President promised in his campaign to undo the entire Obama legacy which included the Affordable Care Act, the Iran Nuclear Agreement, the Trans Pacific Trade Agreement, etc etc 
"With all the ugliness and bitterness in the Presidential Campaign,the world has just witnessed an unbelievably graceful transfer of power in the most powerful nationin the world"

Business and government leaders must know when to let go with grace. Former British Prime Minister David Cameron, whatever one might think of him, did not have to resign. But he chose to let go and resign with grace. 
What is grace The biblical definition is Unmerited favour. A good thing is done to us that we do not deserve or earn. Every human being on earth is moved to tears when the Christian hymn is sung: Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me; I once was lost but now I am found; was blind but now I see. Grace is also defined as follows: Smoothness and elegance of movement; courtesy, politeness, decency, breeding, respect; to bring honour or credit to someone or something by ones action, attendance or participation. Barack and Michelle Obama may have given grace a new meaning. 
Who can forget the images of Barack and Michelle Obama with Donald and Melania Trump at the inauguration especially during the welcome to the White House for tea and the departure of Barack and Michelle on Marine One which took them to Andrews Air Force Base for the Air Force One flight to California. Because Barack Obama was no longer the President, the plane was not called Air Force One!! The New American President and his wife must also be given credit for their graciousness to the Obamas at the inauguration. However, it was the incumbent President, Barack Obama, who took the lead and gave instructions to his staff to make the transition peaceful and graceful putting all the ugliness behind. 
How many leaders in Sri Lanka can you think of who have grace How many leaders know how to let go and depart the stage with grace How many leaders in Sri Lanka resign or leave the stage because it is the right thing to do Doing the right thing with grace is at the core of leadership and must be taught in every pre-school, high school, college, university, professional institute, government organization, business organization and every church, mosque and temple.

Google Loon delay: Govt. seeks AG's advice
	
The Government has sought the advice of the Attorney General on the action it should take on the delay by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) approving the Google Loon Project, Telecommunication Infrastructure Development Minister Harin Fernando said today.
He told a news conference that the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) and the Cabinet approved the project. "But the delay is caused by the ITU" he said.
He said the Google Company Chief would also be keen to see the proposed project when he visited Sri Lanka next month for the 'Digital Island' Digital Summit.
When asked about the WIFI project, the minister said it was being implemented. "The issue is that we have not been able to launch a marketing drive to make people aware of the locations where they could get free WiFi. We have asked the Finance Ministry for funds for such a drive and to go ahead with a campaign when we receive the funds," the minister said.
He said fiber optic cables were being laid covering a large area. The minister assured that this would be a revolution as it would be possible to have video conferencing among households. "You will be able to engage in video conferencing with your next door neighbour soon," he said.
The minister said two-thirds of the fiber optic cable network has been completed. (Yohan Perera)

Mahendran acts as advisor to Fin Min: ACF
	
The Anti-Corruption Front (ACF) led by Ven. Ulapone Sumangala Thera wrote to President Maithripala Sirisena today demanding him to prevent former Central Bank governor Arjuna Mahendran from attending meetings at the Finance Ministry.
In its letter, signed by the Thera and the Fronts Advisor Rajith Keerthi Tennakoon, the ACF said that Mr. Mahendran is a regular attendee of the Finance Ministry meetings which are being held every Tuesday and Thursday to advise current Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy on decisions that should be taken by the Monetary Board.
It said Dr. Coomaraswamy, Treasury Secretary Dr. R. H. S. Samaratunga and Advisor to the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry R. Paskaralingam take part in these meetings.
Mr. Mahendran, who faces serious allegations regarding the controversial Treasury bond scam, currently acts as an advisor to the Ministry of Finance on the Central Bank. When Dr. Coomaraswamy was appointed Governor this meeting was held each Monday and Thursday at 5 pm on July, August and September. The dates later changed to Tuesday and Thursday and the last meeting was held on January 6, 2017 at 11 am. During that meeting, Mahendran advised Coomaraswamy on the decisions that should be taken by the Monetary Board, which is a violation of the Banking Act, the letter said.
The ACF lauded the President for appointing a Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate the Central Bank bond issue and recommend actions. It urged the President to show his commitment to good governance by action and not by mere words.
If Mahendran is still in a position to advise and influence the Monetary Board, the people of Sri Lanka will surely think that the Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry which you will appoint will be another ploy to buy time. Thus we sincerely believe that you would immediately prevent Mahendran from communicating with the Treasury as a coordinator to the Ministry of Finance, the letter said.

50mn to improve Colombo water network
	
The European Investment Bank (EIB) today said it will provide EUR 50 million to support improvement and expansion of sewage networks across the Sri Lankan capital Colombo.

The new loan will help the Colombo Municipal Council achieve its goal of providing full sanitation coverage to benefit people living and working in the greater Colombo area.

The new loan is EIBs first ever support for water investment in Sri Lanka and the first loan for public sector investment agreed with the new post-civil war government.

Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayke said the new support from the EIB will help unlock essential new investment to improve sanitation in Colombo.
EIB Vice President Andrew McDowell said increased access to sanitation to be achieved by this project will improve the lives of thousands of people living in Colombo and contribute to achievement of sustainable development goals in Sri Lanka.
The EIB is pleased to be working closely with partners in Sri Lanka to ensure an environmentally sustainable future for the countrys capital and is grateful for the excellent cooperation with the Asian Development Bank in our first joint support in the country, he said. 
The existing water supply and sewage network in Colombo was built a hundred years ago and is not adequate for the citys needs. Once complete the upgraded water network will enable a clean water supply 24 hours a day and seven days a week, compared to the currently heavily restricted service.
The new water investment programme will include provision of a new sewage network in currently un-served areas of Kirillopone. Under the initiative a new wastewater treatment facility will also be built to reduce pollution at the Wellawata sea outfall.

## Title: NIGHT AND FOG

NIGHT AND FOG
	
In Silenced Shadows, a collection of searing poetry just published, Sri Lankans mourn and challenge the enforced disappearance of tens of thousands of their citizens throughout the country. Amnesty Internationals former global media chief, Richard Reoch, says of this trilingual collection: Society, power and justice are laid out like corpses in a mortuary for examination.
When history began to turn against Hitler, he issued an infamous secret directive known by its codename: Night and Fog. It allowed the Nazis to abduct anyone by night, so that they effectively vanished without trace. 
Under cover of Night and Fog, Hitlers forces set about the immediate, effective and enduring intimidation of the population. It was spearheaded by Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel. He told his forces: Efficient intimidation can only be achieved either by capital punishment or by measures by which the relatives of the criminal and the population do not know [the prisoners] fate. 
Silenced Shadows, just published, is a deeply troubling testament to the Night and Fog of our times. Its a chilling reality revealed by the statistical evidence from dozens of countries around the world. What the facts show is that the poison of this cancer has now entered the blood stream of contemporary nations under democratically elected governments. 
This slender volume of poetry is filled  in Sinhala, Tamil and English  with the voices of those whose loved ones have been abducted and made to vanish without trace over the decades of violent conflict in Sri Lanka. 
In her poem Still Waiting, Radhia Rameez watches a mother sitting outside the skeleton of her house, weaving palm baskets with her dead fingers, and waiting: 
her eyes are a story 
and in them I read 
of stolen people, 
vanished off the earth 
like shadows in the night, 
of war and carnage and burning palm trees, 
the torture of uncertainty... 
This mother is not alone in her agony and bewilderment. The numbers affected are staggering: the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances ranks Sri Lanka second in the world in the total number of cases reported to that body (some 12,000). Amnesty International says the number is a mere fraction of tens of thousands of complaints made to local commissions throughout the country. 

"This mother is not alone in her agony and bewilderment. The numbers affected are staggering: the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances"

The Chilean poet and author Ariel Dorfman, himself a survivor of the brutal coup that brought General Pinochet to power, continues to speak out worldwide in protest against these crimes. He also asks us to honour the courage and tenacity of those who  like the poets of Silenced Shadows have refused to let their loved ones be forgotten. 
We have grown strangely used to them over the last 25 years, Dorfman told an Amnesty International conference in Edinburgh, the women with a small photo of a man pinned to their dark dress, the extended tribe of those whose loved ones, from Chile to Kurdistan, from Argentina to Ethiopia, from Guatemala to Guinea, have been abducted in the night and never heard of again. Mothers and daughters, wives and sisters, demanding to know the true fate of their men, demanding that they be returned to their families alive. They have become a habitual presence, these faraway women on the television screen asking at least for a body to bury, that they be allowed to start mourning their dead. 
But it is not only the cases of menfolk that fill the grim dossiers of the disappeared. The lethal cocktail of illegal detention, torture, sexual violence and extrajudicial killing has claimed the lives of countless women. Children have also been seized, tortured and killed. The legions of the disappeared have been dragged into seeming oblivion not only by agents of the state, but also by armed opposition groups  all acting lawlessly and in violation of the most fundamental standards of humanity. 
Nor is it only the wish for closure and for the final rituals of mourning that rise from the pages of Silenced Shadows. Society, power and justice are laid out like corpses in a mortuary for examination. I believed in rules and the law, writes the author of Looking for Raju: 
What is the rule, the law that allows 
stealing of the young, 
And then making them disappear... 

I will not cease to search, 
I will not stop my questionings, 
I will not die, but live to the end of time 
Seeking my son and asking questions 
from every one. 
This volume comes hard on the heels of the comprehensive report of the Consultation Task Force set up by Sri Lankas president as part of the countrys truth, justice, reconciliation, and non-recurrence process. The Task Force received more than 7,000 submissions, many of them expressing outrage at the huge backlog of unresolved disappearance cases. 
There will be over 100,000 complaints to the Office of Missing Persons, the Organization of Families of the Disappeared told the Task Force. Lest anyone think the problem is somehow limited to one ethnic group alone, or only to terrorist suspects and the war, the Task Force report presents what it calls a sobering catalogue of no fewer than 15 different categories of disappearances spanning all communities. 
The decades of Night and Fog stretch from the 1970s through to June 2016. It was heart-breaking, says Manouri Muttetuwegama, chair of the Task Force, to see people coming from the South, still looking for answers for those who had disappeared during the 1971 JVP insurrection.
Despite three previous disappearance commissions, including an All IslandDisappearances Commission, there is still a population within the country looking for answers, and for justice - evoked in the verses of Looking for Raju: 
Tens of thousands of such men, 
Such women, walk this country. 
In the South, the North and the East, 
Everywhere, every day, asking the same questions. 
They are most probably dead, the countrys Prime inister told a British journalist in January 2016 when asked about the disappeared last seen alive in government custody: 
Jon Snow (Channel 4): We have specific cases in which people are recorded as having surrendered. They were seen in detention one year on, but they cannot now be seen. Youre saying theyre dead. 
Prime Minister: They are most probably dead. 
It is an answer as chilling as the sleepless nights that haunt the aching verses of these poems. 
Every year hundreds of thousands of Amnesty International supporters send personal letters to families of the disappeared, or appeals to governments on their behalf. 
At a time in history where it is all too easy to feel defenceless and passive and irrelevant, says Ariel Dorfman, it is heartening to see how some of the least powerful people on this earth can score a victory of the imagination against their enemies, can prove that it is possible for the modernity of human rights to defeat the modernity of inhuman authoritarianism. Indeed, the relatives of the disappeared are handing us a model for how other humans can make use of the forces of globalization to make this world a less threatening home for us all. 
Every time I come home and see all the cards and letters it reminds me that people are working on this. [It] gives me strength to keep going, says Sandya Eknaligoda whose tireless campaign has been an inspiration to many. Her husband, Prageeth Eknaligoda, one of Sri Lankas leading investigative journalists, was reported missing two days before the countrys 2010 Presidential Election. He was working for a pro-opposition website. 
She went to the police. Her words, if printed as poetry, would slip seamlessly into Silenced Shadows: 
I was told that getting abducted 
was fashionable 
and that my husband 
would soon return. 
They asked me to go home 
and wait.

## Title: Preferential treatment for influential prisoners: A hoax or not

Preferential treatment for influential prisoners: A hoax or not
	
Unable to cope with the horrific and reprehensible conditions of the prisons, powerful prisoners on the lookout for better facilities, get admitted to the prison hospital unethically.
Though it has been surmised through several incidents that influential prisoners receive preferential treatment in prisons it was only recently that a politician came into the limelight by exposing the ongoing corruption in prisons.
Disclosing the mafia in prisons purportedly perpetrated by prison doctors MP Hirunika Premachandra told parliament last month that several doctors had a hand in giving unlawful special treatment to prisoners.
Pointing out how this malpractice was a contravention of the prison ordinance she said that the genuinely ill were disregarded. 
She thus accused Dr. Lakshman Jayamanne, the Medical Officer in Charge and Dr. Malinda Wanigasekara of the Prison Hospital. The prison medical staff falls under the purview of the Health Ministry and currently there is an inquiry against them.
According to the performance report of 2015 there are 20 employed medical officers in the Department of Prisons though there are 40 approved posts. There are 17 registered/assistant medical officers as well. 
Ms Premachandra revealed the fraudulent nature of certain prison doctors who allegedly made money out of it. She noted how mobile phones and related accessories were in the possession of prisoners and how fake medical reports have been prepared.
Citing an example, she pointed out how a prisoner who was deemed fit to go after completing his one year prison sentence (which he had allegedly spent at the prison hospital) had been given a medical report stating he was sick when he was re-imprisoned the same day. 
According to her an MP had been given a medical report without an ECG stating that he had a grave heart disease.
Another politician had been given a mattress for a testicular disease. She remarked that there was a furnished room with an attached bathroom, a mosquito net and bed in the new magazine prison allocated for politicians serving their term in prisons.
Certain parties have challenged the accuracy and ethicality of these statements. A retired commissioner, who accepted the occurrence of corruption within prisons told us that the MP had made a mockery of State service and it is not possible for the Prison Commissioner to reveal confidential medical records. 
Doctors are given hampers and foreign trips in exchange of medical reports
-Lionel Weerasinghe- Retired Commissioner General of Prisons
Just like other institutes there is corruption going on in prisons. Prisons are built to accommodate those of the lower classes as most prisoners are from those strata of society. But when the elite, middle class people, businessmen, and politicians come, they dont find the facilities they have been accustomed to. Naturally they look for means to get those facilities, said Lionel Weerasinghe, a retired Commissioner General of Prisons. 
Elaborating on how prisoners are admitted to the prison hospital he said that those who complained of an ailment when being admitted to prisons were referred to the prison doctor who decided whether the prisoner should be hospitalized or sent to the cell. If the judiciary recommends medical treatment then the person is directly admitted to the prison hospital. The prison hospital does not have specialised clinics. So when the necessity arises for specialised treatment they have to be directed to the General Hospital, he said. 
According to the Prison Ordinance the medical officer, assistant medical officer and apothecary are under the supervision and control of the Director-General of Health Services. The medical officer is supposed to furnish full particulars of every case of compulsory or artificial feeding carried out by him to the Superintendent and the Director General of Health Services. However Weerasinghe charged that these proceedings did not take place. 
He noted that through the prison ordinance doctors have the total authority of ensuring prison healthcare. Doctors are supposed to update their journal daily. I dont think it is maintained, which is why such corruption takes place, he said. 
When a case requiring special attention is brought before a medical officer he should report the case and the recommendations in writing to the Superintendent. When we asked Weerasinghe if politicians received preferential treatment he replied that this was a time when doctors were given hampers and foreign trips in exchange of medical reports. 

"Our Prison Ordinance was amended several times under the British governance. But after we gained independence there has not been even six amendments. The population of the country has increased. Our way of life has changed. But the ordinance remains almost unchanged, he added"

Labouring prisoners are supposed to be examined from time to time by the medical officer. The medical officer should enter the names of any prisoner who are unfit to work in the medical journal. This raises doubts as to whether influential prisoners attempt to avoid labour through the doctors prognostic. The prison sentence of certain inmates include hard labour. Today, prison labour includes training and production unlike in the past. In regional prisons inmates do domestic labour, whereas you find organised labour in the Welikada, Bogambara and Mahara prisons. We dont make prisoners clean drains or cook in the kitchen. Labour is humane though the verdict states hard labour, he said. 
Stating that the causes for giving preferential treatment were deeper and not apparent as one thought he said there were serious flaws in the justice system as the remand population is much higher than the number convicted. The delay in providing justice is a serious issue. The increased number of remand prisoners point out that there is something wrong somewhere in the justice system. Most people have a punitive attitude. Due to this punitive mentality cases get piled up and results in overcrowding. Due to the condition of the prisons its officers focus on maintaining prisons than developing them. This is why one group is forced to look for facilities, he said. 
Our Prison Ordinance was amended several times under the British governance. But after we gained independence there has not been even six amendments. The population of the country has increased. Our way of life has changed. But the ordinance remains almost unchanged, he added.
If there is a complaint against a doctor, he cannot proceed with his work until he is proven not guilty
-MP Hirunika Premachandra
Speaking to Daily Mirror MP Hirunika Premachandra said that Dr. Malinda Wanigasekara has been transferred to the National Cancer Hospital in Maharagama, while no action has been taken against the other doctor who allegedly has a rape case and a maintenance case levelled against him. I got all the information pertaining to these allegations by mid-November. Thereafter I investigated the matter and was able to find out details about the prison, prison hospital, prison doctors and the prisoners, she said. 

"I got all the information pertaining to these allegations by mid-November. Thereafter I investigated the matter and was able to find out details"
According to the doctors ordinance if there is a complaint against a doctor, the doctor cannot proceed with his work in any hospital until he is proven to be not guilty. However one doctor is still working at the Welikada prison hospital. I am very perplexed. I dont know who is helping him. Most of the doctors are with this doctor. So he is free, she added.

VIPS have been receiving preferential treatment based on medical recommendation for the past 25 years or so
-Wijedasa Rajapakshe- Minister of Justice
Minister of Justice, Wijedasa Rajapakshe admitted that VIPs have been receiving preferential treatment based on medical recommendation for the past 25 years or so. According to the constitution all are equal before the law. But regrettably, we have observed how certain VIPs have received different treatment at prisons based on medical recommendation, he said. 
Stating that there were two aspects to the malpractice he said, When prison doctors conduct themselves in such a manner people lose confidence on the entire judiciary. Secondly, the integrity and dignity of the medical professionals are lost. 

"When prison doctors conduct themselves in such a manner people lose confidence on the entire judiciary"
On the other hand if a medical doctor says that an inmate is in need of medical attention others cant deny it as he is specialised in that field, he said. He added that if prison authorities denied a doctors recommendation and if the prisoners condition became severe as a consequence, the prison authorities would fall into trouble. He also said prison doctors may have the opportunity to give preferential treatment because there was no one above him in the hierarchy. 
It is now high time for the Prison Ministry, the Justice Ministry and the Health Ministry to come together and formulate guidelines and regulations to be followed, he said. 

Since the inquiry is pending I cannot state that certain individuals have been given such treatment
-D. M. Swaminathan- Minister of Prison Reforms
Commenting on the allegations made by MP Hirunika Premachandra that there is a furnished room in the new magazine prison allocated for politicians, the Minister of Prison Reforms D.M. Swaminathan,said, As public servants and MPs we are bound and committed to uphold the Constitution of Sri Lanka and no prisoner is given preferential treatment. With regard to MP Premachandras allegations there is an ongoing inquiry which is conducted by prison authorities. I was briefed by the prison authorities that even MP Premachandra was made aware of this inquiry and that the prison authorities requested an appointment from her to obtain a statement from her and so that she too can share the information that she has with the prison authorities, with regard to these allegations. 

"As public servants and MPs we are bound and committed to uphold the Constitution of Sri Lanka"
Since the inquiry is pending I cannot state that certain individuals have been given such treatment since it has not been proved. However, if the inquiry finds evidence to that effect we will definitely take action against officials who have given preferential treatment to prisoners. Only after the report is handed over to me, I can speculate on the course of action that will be taken, he said when asked about measures to prevent preferential treatment.

We are very disappointed about the comments made by certain politicians
-Samantha Ananda- GMOA Media Spokesman 
Samantha Ananda, the media spokesperson for the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said that an independent inquiry free of political influence should be conducted to look into the veracity of the allegations instead of solely accusing doctors without credible facts. It is unfair by the doctors to face such criticism because, as far as we know, doctors in the prison hospital do a very difficult job with minimum facilities, he said. 
Prisoners have various kinds of diseases. Doctors need to take extra precautions when handling them as some may act differently, he added. 
Stating that the doctors duty was to examine the patient and treat any detected diseases he said, If a doctor gives saline to a prisoner one might see that as preferential treatment. But it is the doctor who has the specialised ability to detect whether saline should be given. A lay person should accuse a doctor publicly of malpractice after informing the responsible authorities and getting their opinion on it. 
As a union we are very disappointed about the comments made by certain politicians. If doctors refuse to work in prison hospitals these politicians should be held responsible, he added.

Acting Director General of Health Services
-Dr. Jayasundara Bandara
Dr. Jayasundara Bandara, the newly appointed Director General of Health Services said that all prison doctors are appointed by the Ministry of Health. Prison doctors, nurses and other medical services should be provided and regulated by the Ministry of Health. There is a directorate called prison health welfare, he said. 
He said that the ongoing inquiry regarding two doctors was not related to the regulation of health services but rather to the misuse of medical supplies etc. 





The allegations are all rumours
-Thushara Upuldeniya- Prisons Media Spokesperson
Thushara Upuldeniya, Prisons Media Spokesperson said that prisoners were admitted to the prison hospital based solely on the doctors recommendation. Some prisoners need special treatment under medical grounds. So they are under the special observation of the medical staff. If the prison doctor cant manage that patient then he will be directed accordingly, he said. 
When asked about politicians being given special treatment he said that the allegations were all rumours.

President is closing stable door after horse has bolted: JVP
	
President Maithripala Sirisena's decision to appoint a Special Presidential Commission (SPC) of Inquiry to probe the Central Bank bond scam is only similar to closing the stable doors after the horse has bolted, JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today.
He told a news conference that there was a sinister move to block the scheduled to be held in Parliament tomorrow and that the case filled by the Ven. Thiyawala Palitha Thera against the parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) report on the bond scam was a part of this plan.
"The plan is to raise objections on holding the debate on the basis that the matter has been referred to Court and as such subjected to subjudice. We will fight against any moves to stall the debate," Mr. Dissanayake said.
Referring to the case filed by Ven. Palitha Thera, he said monks appear to be engaged in everything else other thanthe propagation of the Buddha Dhamma.
Mr. Dissanayake took a swipe at the Ven.Bengamuve Nalaka Thera whom he accused of defending MP Wimal Weerawansa who was remanded on charges of misusing State vehicles and the monk who heads the Rawana Balaya also accused of being given several vehicles by Mr. Weerawansa. (Yohan Perera)

President will enact Sampanthan Constitution: Keheliya
	
President Maithripala Sirisena is attempting to enact a Sampanthan Constitution by cancelling the first three clauses in the First Chapter of the current Constitution, joint opposition MP Keheliya Rambukwella claimed today.
Addressing a news conference, he said the new Constitution was based by the proposals submitted by the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan as a condition for the TNAs support to President Maithripala Sirisena at the 2015 presidential election.
These proposals pose a threat to the unitary character of the country. The subcommittee report on constitutional reforms, including those between the centre and the periphery, calls for the alteration of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd clauses, the MP claimed. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Some ministers call officials 'Booruwa' -- Asoka Peiris
	
Asoka Peiris, the former chairman of the Delimitation Review Committee said some ministers believed that government officials should act according to their dictates like schoolchildren -- sitting down and standing up when ordered to by their teachers. He said some ministers addressed officials as 'Booruwa'.
He made these comments yesterday (22) while expressing his best wishes to the National delegates seminar held on the theme of Gamata Deriyak- Ratata Balayak, held with the participation of JVP leader Anura Dissanayake and party secretary Tilvin Silva at the Maharagama Fair premises.
He said he was able to change this attitude among the ministers. He said there might be a reaction tomorrow to his revelations
This was his first speech at a political meeting although he had participated in and spoken at numerous meetings during his 28 years as an administrative officer in public service. "I am still a government servant, but I came here to reveal the truth despite the risk involved," he said.
He said that when he was working in the delimitation committee he had once asked the minister to allow him to speak, as the minister was talking without a break and giving him (Asoka Peiris) no chance to speak
He referred to a former minister, the late Richard Pathirana, who addressed officials in the ministry as Booruwa, and how he had once responded to the minister on such an occasion .
Speaking further he said the time had come to think of changing the government.
He said those who ruled the country had devastated it. He said those on the platform were capable of leading the country to a better future. He asked the people to prepare for a change in 2020.(Muditha Dayananda)

Ven. Ajahn Brahm to conduct meditation retreat for the Sangha
	
	Residentialmeditation retreat
	
	
	200 monks/nuns of the Maha Sangha to participate
	
	
	10 days retreat starting from January 21
	

unique event that takes place later this month when Ven. Ajahn Brahmavamso conducts a residential meditation retreat exclusively for monks and nuns at Bandarawela. Around two hundred members of the Maha Sangha, including monks and nuns will participate in the 10-day retreat starting January 21. 
The world-renowned meditation teacher has conducted several retreats in Sri Lanka where both the Maha Sangha and the laity participated. Accepting the invitation by the Ajahn Brahm Society in Sri Lanka, he suggested that a retreat for monks and nuns will be most beneficial since they in turn could spread the meditation practice among larger numbers. He stressed that such a retreat is of great value to Sri Lanka with its large community of monks and nuns spread throughout the country. 
Ven. Ajahn Brahm has a busy schedule of programmes both at the Bodhinyana Monastery, the forest monastery in Perth, Australia where he resides, as well as his constant visits to other countries, and we are indeed very fortunate to have him with us in Sri Lanka, says a spokesperson of the Ajahn Brahm Society. 

"Ven. Ajahn Brahm has a busy schedule of programmes both at the Bodhinyana Monastery, the forest monastery in Perth, Australia where he resides, as well as his constant visits to other countries, and we are indeed very fortunate to have him with us in Sri Lanka"

This is a historic event where a large number of the Maha Sangha meet to meditate and discuss the Dhamma under the guidance of Ven. Ajahn Brahm. The response has been most encouraging and it is after much planning that the society has been able to accommodate such a large number with ideal facilities to meditate. 
The venue of the retreat is the Bandarawela resort managed by Sri Lanka Tourism which has been working in close cooperation with Ajahn Brahm Society over the past several years. In addition to Ajahn Brahm, one of his senior-most pupils, Ajahn Brahmali has also been conducting meditation programmes at the resort.

The practice of bringing the dana for the participants of retreats is one that the temples together with dayakayas in and around Bandarawela started from the first visit of Ajahn Brahm ten years ago. The temple monks accompanied the dayakas when they brought the dana to ensure that everything went off smoothly. For this retreat too having noticed this practice many volunteers have come forwards to offer dana. The morning dana will be offered by both the Ajahn Brahm Society members and others who wish to offer dana to the Ariya Sangha. As in the past, the dawal dana will be offered by the people in Bandarawela and surrounding villages coordinated by the area temples. The support extended by these temples go a long way to make these retreats a success. Following traditional practice the monks and nuns will go on pindapatha to a nearby location where the dana will be offered. 
The Ajahn Bahm Society Sri Lanka would also like to thank the many contributors and volunteers without whose support this retreat would not have been possible.

Water: a treasure for the survival of all species
	
BY : KAMANTHI WICKRAMASINGHE
With news about a shortage in water supply making headlines, many Sri Lankans have now become aware of the importance of this resource. However,we still tend overuse water when using it for our daily purposes. While water constitutes a greater percentage of our body, it is an essential solvent which keeps Planet Earth hydrated.
Importance of a backup water system
Besides the need for sustaining life, we use water for many things, often taking it for granted. We all need to understand that everything from bathing to cleaning and even flushing the toilet is made possible because of water.
Therefore, in the event of scarcity of water, a water source is the most important resource to have. This is often overlooked by home owners and they depend on a general water line. When having a backup water system, you could always rely on it during an emergency.
Advantages of a well water system
As we all look at cutting down costs on water and electricity bills there are many ways in which you could save these resources right at your home. Building a well to access that water is definitely an investment, but it is an investment with guaranteed returns and plenty of benefits.
Following are a few advantages of a well water system.
Provides lower costs
Owning a private water well means no more municipal usage fees. Therefore you need not worry about that extra amount of money which would have to be allocated for your monthly water bill.
Better health
Public water is usually treated with chlorine, fluoride and other harsh chemicals which are difficult to filter out.
Better taste
According to experts, well water is refreshing as it is naturally softened. Therefore since its natural it tastes better than chemically-treated municipal water.
Environmentally friendly
Well water comes right from the Earth; therefore it is much better on our environment than water treated by chemicals.
How clean are these resources
Water being drawn from a well was once precipitation that fell on to the Earths surface. Wells are drilled into rock formations that are permeable and porous enough to hold significant amounts of water (an aquifer) and pump water to the surface for use. Naturally, big particles that can be found in streams, such as leaf chunks, bugs, and bubble-gum wrappers, will not be seen in groundwater. But groundwater can contain other items which are invisible to the naked eye.
Some are naturally occurring and some are human-made substances. Groundwater can contain hydrogen sulphide (makes the water smell like rotten eggs) or other naturally occurring chemicals. Groundwater also may contain petroleum, organic compounds, or other chemicals introduced by human activities.
Groundwater contamination can occur if the well is located near land that is used for farming where certain kinds of chemicals are applied to crops or near a gas station that has a leaking storage tank. Leakage from septic tanks and/or waste-disposal sites also can contaminate groundwater. A septic tank can introduce bacteria to the water, and pesticides and fertilizers that seep into farmed soil can eventually end up in water drawn from a well. A well might have been placed in land that was once used for something like a garbage or chemical dump site. This would again contaminate ground water. In any case, it is wise to have your well water tested for contaminates.
Contaminated well water can cause vomiting, diarrhoea and potentially lead to many other serious health problems like kidney disease. Sources confirm that contaminants known as nitrates are especially hazardous for infants because they can disrupt oxygen flow in the blood of babies. Therefore well owners are advised to test water every three to five years for lead, arsenic, radon, uranium and certain other heavy metals.
Tips to keep your well/alternative water sources clean
Maintenance is key when having alternative water sources. It is essential to maintain water as it gets contaminated fast.
Here are six tips to keep your water sources clean:
1. Protect the surface : Build a wall around the top of the well, with a reinforced concrete drainage apron around it. This will prevent surface water running into the well; particularly important where there are animal droppings around.
2. Reduce turbidity : If a well is serving up cloudy, muddy water, it may have too much silt at the bottom. Send an intrepid digger down there with a shovel to dig out the silt and debris, then put a layer of gravel at the bottom of the well. The gravel will keep the silt down, and when someone drops a bucket on a rope down to the bottom of the well it will be less likely to scoop up silt as well as water.
3. Disinfect : Scrub down the sides of the well with a chlorine solution to kill microbes that can make people sick. Disinfect the well water by temporarily adding a strong chlorine solution.
4. Cover it : Install a reinforced concrete cover over the top of the well to keep anything from falling in and polluting the water.
5. Install a pump : This will make it easier to draw water, if maintaining a pump is possible. A pump piping water up from the bottom of the well takes away the possibility of infecting water with a dirty bucket or rope.
Importance of water purification
Gaining access to safe drinking water is a serious issue affecting people of all ages worldwide. For those living in remote communities where the availability of improved water sources is limited, challenges can be immense and impact quality of life in significant ways.
However, with water purifier systems, vulnerable individuals can acquire one of the most important resources needed to sustain daily existence, and obtain peace of mind in the process. This task could be made possible with a Unilever Pureit water purifier. This water purifier goes through a four-stage purification process making drinking water safe for consumption. These include the micro-fibre filter, activated carbon filter, germ-kill processor and polisher.

Why cant we make decent jokes
	
There are those things which you know, but it takes time to know that you know it. 
The New Year weekend turned out to be really stressful, and at such times I have two escape hatches  music and comedy. 
I got into the comedy hatch via You Tube. There are those classics such as Monty Python with its peculiarly British sense of humour, along with well known names such as Rowan Atkinson (his interview of Elton John is hilarious), but there are thousands more very funny people, both men and women, getting audiences to shake in their seats effortlessly  comedians from the West, the Middle East, Asia, Africa and elsewhere. 
After watching a few videos, I got round to knowing something I discovered long ago without actually being able to put it correctly into words. 
It isnt correct to say Sri Lankans dont have a sense of humour. They do. But they dont know how to channel and transmit that humour in a professional manner. The channels which can discover, nurture, promote and employ such talent do not exist. 
Sri Lankan comedy has two main streams  films and the stage. Film comedians such as Freddie Silva were sometimes brilliant  I remember him miming bus travel in a film, hanging on to the bar with one hand while slapping mosquitoes with the other. But such talents were often wasted by incompetent directors. 

"It isnt correct to say Sri Lankans dont have a sense of humour. They do. But they dont know how to channel and transmit that humour in a professional manner"

Radio had Vinoda Samaya. But this was exceptional and one can see today that its quality and popularity depended entirely on the talent, style and personalities of the comedians involved. Nothing produced after the demise of Vinoda Samaya can come even remotely close to their excellence. 
The stage is better in this regard than the films. There was a time, at least until the 1980s, when the cinema was as good if not better. But it has nosedived into pathetic attempts at laughter while the stage, when compared to what one can see internationally on You Tube, rarely makes the grade when it comes to themes and delivery. Our comedians do not take risks, and I dont mean physical risks such as slipping and falling. Taking a few titles from You Tube would illustrate this point. Maz Jobrani is an Arab-American while Russel Peters is Indian. Jobranis acts have such as: Dont buy anything from Middle East people, They killed Bin Laden, Why theres a billion Indians in the world, Kicking brown people off planes and Trump is an idiot. 
Imagine any Sri Lankan comedian doing an act called, Our president is an idiot. People like Jobrani and Peters are so successful because they know how to surf through minefields. Take some of Peters titles: Why I dont do Arab, Jew vs. Indian jokes, Why Chinese cant do business with Indians. 
Jobrani delivers on anecdote, nuance and body language to get the laughs. There are many more out there, both sexes, doing the same with consummate skill. American comedian Amy Schumer gets people to laugh on themes such as Women Who Kill, and on her not-so-romantic Paris visit and her session with the gynecologist, and about her workout instructor. 

Carl Joshua Ncube of Zimbabwe tells Robert Mugabe jokes. Another comedian makes fun of the bureaucracy (issuing of passports). Zambesi News is a popular TV programme where three young men  one white, two black  re-work every day news bulletins in a hilarious manner. Chubby Mexican comedian Gabriel Iglesias gets people to shake on themes such as Fluffy visits Saudi Arabia, Broke Back Mexican and High School Reunion. Joanna Rants and Eric Rivera make fun of the Spanish accent. 
All these people, and many more, take risks as they touch on race, religion, politics and culture. But they are never deliberately offensive, and they know the art of making a stereotype work against itself. In Sri Lanka, unfortunately, comedians dont take risks. Their jokes are bland and lack both content and technique. 
The art of the stand up comedian has never taken root in Sri Lanka. It should. It has thousands of exponents and millions of fans all over the world, and stand up comedians are among the most effective critics of wicked politicians, xenophobia and many social evils because they are able to make fun of such negative phenomena and get away with it (with rare exceptions like Myanmar, where comedians who dared make fun of the military regime were jailed and tortured). But comedians practiced their art effectively, and continue to do so, sometimes even brazenly, in the sorriest places ranging from Gen. Pinochets Chile to todays Zimbabwe. 
Sri Lanka has a long way to go. TV channels should discover talent and promote it. The theatre sometimes shows flashes of hilarity, but its way too bland. As for the cinema, it lost its sense of humour with the demise of K. A. W. Perera and Manik Sandrasagara. Everyone now is far too serious. Its a disaster of national magnitude.

Yahapalakayas should realise that mere talk wont do  Judicious use of the rod has its place in poli
	
Fear of the stick landing on their backs, prompt buffaloes hitched to ploughs pull harder. If the stick doesnt work on them they are replaced or put away unceremoniously 
No government can be sustained without giving measured doses of the rod to those in need of it. Unless the Yahapalkayas begin rod-treatment against conniving foes and their two-faced pals sitting at Yaha tables, they are asking fortroublebig trouble

Nothing has changed has it Shelley I am tired of watching protests, accidents, kudu arrests, politicians being remanded, burglaries and murder on the news. People are still doing what they like, arent they  observed Joy, switching a news channel to another onecartoon capers Ah, this is more like it, she sighed settling in her chair. Joy was watching TV in the company of her husband Shelton Perera the proprietor of the Wallside Restaurant and Bar. 
Shelton, an incurable cynic snorted, What do you expect Its a situation created by a bunch of characters that messed up our country for years. As members of the Sataka Club they specialised in bribery, corruption, thuggery, abuse of power and looking after its members. Naturally law and order and discipline went for a six. Their rampage over several years was so rabid the country is still wallowing in its long wake. And the Yahapalana crowd has failed to inject enough anti-rabies shots through democratic Yaha methods. But they havent worked have they To be in control and to get things done, Yahapalakayas need to wield enough rod that instills fear. 
Use of the rod
But thats wrong, isnt it asked Joy. 
Right or wrong, from homes, buth kades, corporations to governments, it works. Fear gives authority and control and the fear- creator earns respect. Its amazing how well it works. In the past the man of the family wore the pants or sarong. My great granddad, a gentleman farmer was of that kind. He didnt have a bachelors or an MBA, but he ran an orderly ship. He specialized in cultivating herbal stuff for export. I heard he loved his children but was strict with them; he had not spared the rod on them either. However, as grown ups the children had been thankful that their father had used the rod in making them good and successful people. During that era the ladies wore skirts, redda and hattes (wrap rounds and jackets) or sarees; certainly not pants. They were not graduates either but were well versed in domestic affairs and bringing up children in the proper way as my mother used to say. Together the old-school husband and wife combinations worked well. 
I can agree, with that Shelley, murmured Joy wistfully. It brings memories of my own family. They sounded a bit on the feudal kind though... 


"And the non-use of the use of rod by the Yahapalakayas to produce results is telling a story. It explains why things are being delayed, why those in authority and in the ranks of government service dont care a cuss while their countrymen suffer their indifference"

What does that matter interrupted Shelton. I am sure they were decent folk. A pity those days are long gone,.Todays rushed and stressed out gentlemen have no time for anything other than work, booze to deaden stretched nerves at the end of the day and flop into bed. The ladies performances are better. Many work either to help to keep home fires burning or build up careers. And like their western sisters, they have jumped on equal rights wagons. Parents are so engrossed in themselves they dont know what the hell their children are doing or have time even for a quick cuddle. They are isolating their children and creating herds of undisciplined brats who go out of control even before they reach their teens. If anyone eavesdrops on a late evening husband-wife-childrens orchestras in the neighbourhood, no further proof is needed. 
Its really a shame, agreed Joy, but cant schools do what the parents dont do 
Shelton laughed mirthlessly. Discipline in schools was when teachers and principals used the rod with the correct intentions when needed; not these days though. I have heard of kids reporting their fathers and class teachers to the police for caning them. So, its bye-bye to six of the best on deserving backsides. Sparing the rod has spoilt the kids who end up as spoilt grown-ups and also as politicos most of whom need a taste of rod if this country and its people are to make it under whatever type of palanaya they voted into power. 
Spare the rod
That was an eye opener, wasnt it So now its spare the rod and let the country sink, purred Tommo a pussycat to his pal and working partner Ooty an owl. Both employed at Wallside as vermin controllers were enjoying their free beers courtesy of the management that evening. 
Thuhoot! And the non-use of the use of rod by the Yahapalakayas to produce results is telling a story. It explains why things are being delayed, why those in authority and in the ranks of government service dont care a cuss while their countrymen suffer their indifference. In comparison their predecessors, the Satakayasa Yama species went to the other extreme in using rods like mercenaries armed with machine guns in the Syrian war. Do you remember how ordinary governors stayed mum and how petrified media governors were when some of their crowd just disappeared off the face of the earth The Satakayas flourished after creating that fear syndrome in runningrather ruining the country with no opposition to talk about. Thank goodness that crowd was thrown out. 
Purshshit. Not entirely; a van load ex- Satakayas and some Blue birds hold ministerial and consultant positions in Yaha ranks. Its unfortunate the Yaha crowd had to accommodate some garbage buried by our governors just to boost the controlling numbers in the House. But these turn coats are proving to be bees under Yaha collars. After attaching themselves like hook worms to the Yahapalapkayas they are playing hide and seek in and out of the House. These political humbugs are talking of crossovers back to the Sataka fold, oppose Yaha proposals for the sake of it and place spokes in development wheels including constitutional reforms while wiping their brows with their chiefs Sataka pota.
Cracking a Yaha weakness
But why dont Yahapalakayas use some rod on those naughty boyos, ahh the bird wanted to know. Many governors harp on that question when drowning their sorrows at Wallside. Our governors who had high hopes of the Yahapalakayas dragging the country from an early grave are disappointed that the Sataka biggies and rankers having nightmares of what they are destined to face in the final reckoning are still free and shooting their mouths off. Recently, the chief of the Satakayas desperate to make a comeback to former glory, promised gallery crowds he would topple the Yaha ship this year. He was prepared to even die in that attempt. 
Ha-ha-haaaa, that will be the day, laughed Oooty the way owls do. 
Oh yeah, savvy governors know that his blah-blah to tickle the ears of dumbos is all gas. But they ask: Why arent the Yahapalakayas whacking the Satakayas who had broken all types of laws in the country every governor knows about, look like a rock climbing task without climbing tackle or rewriting the history of the world Pussy had a point there 
Whoom, whooooom, but havent the Yaha crowd landed some of corrupt and murderous Satakayas behind bars 
Oh sure,grinned pussy, but what a charade that has been. They put some rascals into jail and let them out in no time making it look like a joint exercise between jail birds and jailors. The talk is that the Yahapalakayas dont have what it takes to clear that pile of muck once and for all. Not through the devilish Sataka variety, but subtler and appropriate uses of the rod to good effect. So, if the two main Yaha actors want to survive, the Yaha-Yama cold war, why better put some beef into making a combination of rods work for them. 
Thuhoot, thuhoot, arent they too gentlemanly for rough stuff hooted Ooty. 
Meeoowww, the Yahapalakayas should apply the rod in the manner their fathers and teachers used the rod. No government can be sustained without giving measured doses of the rod to those in need of it. Unless the Yahapalkayas begin rod-treatment against conniving foes and their aiding and abetting two-faced pals sitting at Yaha tables, they are asking for troublebig trouble. 
Thuhooot What about those in ever-green and ever blue camps in need of some rod treatment: tell to see! 
Purshsh! You didnt miss that eh Well, thats a Yaha domestic issue that needs solutions strictly in camera. 
"But what a charade that has been. They put some rascals into jail and let them out in no time making it look like a joint exercise between jail birds and jailors The talk is that the Yahapalakayas dont have what it takes to clear that pile of muck once and for all"
