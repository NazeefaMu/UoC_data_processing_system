He was keen to give them a taste of their own cuisine
	
This senior Green party politico who presided over Policing under Yahapalanaya-One is now tasked with promoting the Pearl of the Indian Ocean as the Wonder of Asia
The other day a visiting South Korean delegation paid a courtesy call on this political bigwig. At this meeting, the delegates expressed their desire to take a hand in promoting Sri Lanka as an alluring tourist destination in their country. One of the delegates during the discussion sought the VIPs opinion on what this country could offer to attract the Korean tourists. Pat came his reply: We have lots of Korean restaurants in the city!
The delegates, of course, had not told the politico that there was no need for Koreans to come all the way here to taste their own cuisine.
