Split at the periphery
	
?
A ceremony to mark the opening of a new administrative bloc was held in the main city in the upcountry on a grand scale recently.
?
A high political authority of the province was the livewire behind the function.
Former mayors and city fathers from both factions of the Blue party were present as invitees.
The high political authority of the province addressing the gathering ? had started berating the Pohottuwa party leaders at the very outset even without saying a word about the event.
?We don?t care about flowers yet to bloom?There?s no future for them??
As the political authority was warming up with his tirade against the Pohottuwa, the participants had begun leaving the hall one by one and by the time he concluded his speech, half the original audience had left the hall.?
The invitees who walked out while the political authority was holding forth were Pohottuwa followers, they say.?

UNP lauds Chamal's remarks on HIZ
	
The views expressed by former Speaker and joint opposition MP Chamal Rajapaksa are always welcome, United National Party (UNP) MP Mujibur Rahaman said today adding that the UNP held views similar to those expressed by Mr. Rajapaksa.
?The former Speaker welcomed the setting up of the Hambantota Industrial Zone (HIZ) as a good move and urged the government to refrain from acquiring cultivated lands those belonging to temples for this purpose,? he said. ?The government had been transparent in dealing with the Hambantota matter unlike the previous government and the agreements signed with the investors will be tabled in Parliament.?
Mr. Rahaman asked why the joint opposition MPs were silent and remained paralysed when lands in Colombo were taken over by the previous regime.
?We wonder where MPs Udaya Gammanpilla and Dallas Alahaperuma were when former defense secretary took over several lands in Colombo,? he asked and underscored the fact that some of the people whose lands were taken over by the previous regime were yet to receive compensation.(Yohan Perera)

## Title: Are there  any  more ministers  to quit the unity govt.?
## Section: News Features
## Date: 10 January 2017 12:01 am
Are there  any  more ministers  to quit the unity govt.?
	
Following are the views expressed by certain ministers in response to queries raised about the possibility of more ministers leaving the government. ??
Minister of Labour and Trade Unions Relations - W.D.J. Seneviratna?
The Minister said there is no need for anyone who works with the correct understanding of the activities of a coalition government, to withdraw from the government.
?This is a consensus government and no individual can expect 100 percent freedom of rule under a government that was formed under one major party. Disputes, shortcomings and difficulties faced by the members of both parties are natural for this type of government. Such weaknesses are unavoidable. ??
We often receive complaints about preferential treatment in giving job opportunities, and some level charges that jobs in one district are given to residents of other districts. ??
The possibility of conflicts and differences of opinion among different parties have to be expected. The government was established to implement some policies accepted by the two parties. And understanding and patience of both parties are vital to achieve the targets based on these policies. ??
I am not disappointed with the activities of the government as I understand the difference of working under a single party government and a government comprising of several parties. ??
However we must strive to attain our common objectives despite all these disparities. Ministers of both parities are working amidst these difficulties, but we must all ?try to overcome these problems with understanding. I am not disappointed with this government, so I will not be leaving the government,? the Minister said. ??
?
"This is a consensus government and no individual can expect 100 percent freedom of rule under a government that was formed under one major party. Disputes, shortcomings and difficulties faced by the members of both parties are natural"
?
State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation - A.H.M. Fowzie
I do not have any problem working with the UNP. ??
Minister Fowzie said he is not aware of the reason that caused the former State Minister Priyankara Jayarathna to leave the government. He said that he did not have any despondency about the activities of the government. ?We are in a national government. I was given a portfolio by the President and I am pursuing my work without any difficulty,? Minister Fowzie added. ??
Q Are you not displeased with certain activities of the government? ??
This government has a set of policies and they work within that frame. The collective policy decision taken by the President, Prime Minister and the ministers should be implemented by collaborative efforts. All of us must work with consciousness without blaming others. I do not criticize others. I must reiterate that I have no despondency and that I will continue to do my work for the benefit of the people of my area.? ??
?
State Minister of Lands - T.B. Ekanayaka
Q Are you displeased with the government ??
No such displeasure - but these days we are discussing about our future activities. During our meeting with the President we discussed about our future activities and also about the obstacles we have to face doing ministerial work. ??
Q What are the obstacles ??
Problems and difficulties common to any ministry. ??
?
"Whenever there is a coalition government problems and diputes arise. In 1977 the joint opposition left the SLFP. But had we contested with unity, we would have won a number of electorates"
?
Q ?Have you confronted any problem while working with the UNP. ??
UNP is a separate party having different policies and different decisions to suit their policies. We are not concerned with these differences. Whenever there is a coalition government problems and diputes arise. In 1977 the joint opposition left the SLFP. But had we contested with unity, we would have won a number of electorates . ??
Now we are undergoing a new experience.Therefore we have to work with understanding of each other. ??
Q Are you satisfied with the activities of the unity government of UPFA and UNP. ??
This is a unity government. Non-compatible incidents are unavoidable. We always try to solve problems through negotiation. We are confident that the President would take appropriate measures to solve the disputes among ministries. ??
State Minister for City Planning and Water Supply - Sudharshani Fernandopulle
?
"They find fault with the unity of SLFP and UNP. People did not give their mandate for a single party to form a government. Is it appropriate if the UNP formed a government with the TNA? Isn?t it better if two major parties joined to form a government"
I have no time to concentrate on despondencies ??
Q ?Many ministers are said to be displeased with the government. Are you also displeased? ??
No, I am not discouraged. Many people are making various comments especially those in the joint opposition. They find fault with the unity of SLFP and UNP. People did not give their mandate for a single party to form a government. Is it appropriate if the UNP formed a government with the TNA? Isn?t it better if two major parties joined to form a government. ??
Following the peoples mandate two main parties united and formed a government. We must respect the peoples? decision. Therefore the two parties have taken the most appropriate decision in forming a national government and to ensure the stability of the country. ??
Q ?Some say several minister are not co-operating with state ministers and deputy ministers. ??
There may be such allegations as all are not alike. We must work in conformity with the law. Such differences prevailed even during our government.Then some ministers were only concerned with the activities of their respective ministries. We have domestic problems too. We must try to solve these problems through discussion. ??
We have suffered immensely in political activities, but if we engage in thinking of these miseries we would not be able to serve the people to the maximum. ??
Deputy Minister of Public Management Reforms - Susantha Punchi Nilame
?
"I joined the SLFP from the UNP openly, without any secrecy and with due respect to the UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe. Likewise if the circumstances compel, I would directly inform President Maithripala Sirisena and leave"
?
The Minister said he is displeased on behalf of the people, and they should be provided with reliefs. ??
Q ?What sort of relief or facilities do you expect? ??
Facilities to improve their living conditions. They voted for us with immense expectation. ??
Q ?Are you not happy with the activities of the government. ??
I do what I think is right, but do not boast or lie. I joined the SLFP from the UNP openly, without any secrecy and with due respect to the UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe. Likewise if the circumstances compel, I would directly inform President Maithripala Sirisena and leave. At the moment I do not have any reason to leave the government, as my main objective is to solve the problems of people in the Trincomalee District. ??
Q ?Are you satisfied with the co-operation you get from your minister. ??
Yes, I do. We have been friends for a long time. I like to work with him. ??
Port and Shipping Deputy Minister - Nishantha Muthuhettigama
"We also have issues relating to the Magampura Harbour and the lands. We expressed our views to President Maithripala Sirisena with regard to these problems"
Minister Muthuhettigama said he will stay with the government despite the problems he is having. ??
Q ?Do you also have issues with the government
We are concerned with the way things are being done. ??
Q ?Could you describe the situation. ??
There is confusion in the statements made by both parties of our national alliance. ??
We also have issues relating to the Magampura Harbour and the lands. We expressed our views to President Maithripala Sirisena with regard to these problems. ??
Q ?Does this suggest you are not satisfied with what is happening. ??
However, ?we would not leave the government because of these problems, as our aim is to do something for the country. ??
Q ?What you say indirectly, there is no problem for you ??
There are problems, but we are trying to solve them. We are equal partners of the government and not a minority of 20 percent. We will show our progess of work in 2017. ??
Q ?Is there any obstacle to your work ??
There are occasions when ministers are not co-operating with state ministers and deputy ministers ??
Q ?Are you subject to these prejudices ??
Of course. ??
Q ?So you are disgusted in this regard. ??
We often discuss these issues with the President and the UPFA General Secretary. We even raise these matters at the meeting held with the participation of the President and the Prime Minister We have even arrived at solutions to certain matters. Nothing can be achieved without an effort. We take various measures to seek solutions to our problems. ??
Megapolis and Western Development Minister - Lasantha Alagiyawanna?
"We were elected to work for the people. I am carrying out my duties - you can visit our electorate and see for yourself. I do not fail to attend parliament meetings. I am the Chairman of the Public Account Committee and offer my contribution to the maximum"
The Minister said he is quite satisfied with his work in the government. ??
Q ?Do you have disgusted attitudes towards the government ??
I do not see any reason for disgust. We were elected to work for the people. I am carrying out my duties - you can visit our electorate and see for yourself. I do not fail to attend parliament meetings. I am the Chairman of the Public Account Committee and offer my contribution to the maximum. I also work for the unity of the party. ??
Q ?Some say SLFP ministers are being subjected to hindrance by UNP politicians.?
I do not experience such difficulties. The on-going development projects are being completed successfully and immense service is being done through the Public Account Committee (PAC) and the sub-committees. ??
The dispute within the party is not a secret. We are devoted to unite the party. We work together, securing the identities of the two parties and would contest elections separately. ??
Protests wouldn?t help to solve the problems. There are false views spread within the society. One is about the draft constitution to be presented in Parliament. There should not be any change to the unitary status of the country. This is the ideal time to seek solutions for the problems of the country . ??
?These two parties are not combined. SLFP will never go for elections, in alliance with the other party. Government is not hundred percent correct. We are trying to minimize the shortcomings. ??
?I am only displeased with the difficulties caused to the people due to the decisions taken by some politicians.

## Title: Billboards and road safety
## Section: News Features
## Date: 10 January 2017 12:02 am
Billboards and road safety
	
Billboards are the most effective advertising mediums used by advertisers worldwide. Due to various advantages, many advertisers use billboards, hoardings, banners and digital screens to attract the attention of potential customers. ?Most of the time, millions are spent to advertise in open public spaces. One can find these advertisements situated at the busiest, crowded junctions and along main roads in major cities determined to attract the attention of passers-by and deliver their messages within seconds. But the use of such billboards along busy roads and junctions is prohibited in many developed countries. ?With background research we made on roadside advertising and road safety in the Town Hall and Arcade area of Colombo by means of random interviews with the public, we found that many people seemed to find most billboards and digital screens entertaining. ??
Several government institutions have authority when it comes to granting permission for outdoor advertising - the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), the Road Development Authority (RDA) and the Urban Development Authority (UDA). The Central Environment Authority (CEA) has the power to make rules and regulations to control roadside advertising and the Sri Lanka traffic police has the power to remove advertising screens and boards considered a threat to road safety. As a result of discussions, digital billboards and roadside advertising are expected to be regulated by the Central Environment Authority together with the RDA and experts. ?
?No ads without permission from RDA?
Bharatha Perera?
- Former Director of Property Management and?Revenue Division - RDA
His comments on roadside advertising and digital billboards: ?
?We are having discussions on whether to allow digital billboards in road reservations, the area under our authorisation. Advertising companies have asked for our permission to put up digital billboards, yet we have not permitted them. We can permit only a limited space for ads, in the small line called road reserve that includes road signs, the pavement and drainage area. Without permission from the RDA, nobody can display advertisements in this area. Permission and allocation take effect after an official visit of confirmation. We allow advertising on traffic islands, to show the brand name for sponsorship. We do not permit billboards at famous archaeological sites, religious places or the coastline. We do not permit digital billboards, 3D ads, trio-vision or light blinking boards. ??
Further opining on the confusion road signs cause, Bharatha Perera said hoardings and billboards were sometimes responsible for ?misinterpretation. Sign misinterpretation could be a leading factor in road accidents. ??
?
We inquired whether there was a connection between roads with large amounts of roadside advertising and accidents from the Sri Lanka traffic police.?
?
?We can remove boards risking road safety?
Palitha Fernando?
- The Deputy Inspector General of Traffic Police - Western Province
?No evidence has been found to prove billboards or outdoor advertising cause road accidents. If anyone notices any problems caused by billboards or digital screens or any kind of roadside advertising which are a threat to road safety, the public can inform the traffic police on this number - 0112439534 and we will be able to send notices to remove the particular billboard or hoarding to the relevant institutions such as the CMC or RDA. We are authorised to inform those institutions to remove the boards that are risking road safety.??
?
?
?No rules to regulate roadside advertising yet?
K.H ?Muthukudaarachchi?
- Director General - CEA
?Outdoor advertising should be regulated in Sri Lanka and we are obviously against the current situation. Roadside advertising boards and hoardings could be a prominent cause for roadside accidents as they distract drivers. There are no rules established to regulate roadside advertising at present on the national level. The Thoroughfare Ordinance enforced in the past has some rules that the country has never followed. At present, we are conducting discussions about regulating outdoor advertising with our Attorney General?s Department and the Legal Draftsman?s Department in coordination with the RDA and an appointed panel of experts.? ?
?
?Most boards are unauthorised?
Jayantha A. Guruge?- Former Director?
of Engineering Works - CMC
?Billboards have been permitted in Sri Lanka by us, to be established in areas belonging to the CMC with certain rules and guidelines. The bottom part of hoisted boards should be at least 30 feet high and the lights should be dimmed after sunset. The boards should be parallel to the roads. Digital boards are prohibited from being exhibited near junctions and flyovers. There are already some unauthorized digital billboards in the Town hall area and one in front of BreadTalk, displaying videos. We have sent a few warnings to get it removed. The only course of action we can take is to warn the owner to remove the board and after several warnings, give permission for another board to be placed in front of the unauthorised board. Very few boards have been put up according to rules and regulations and most are unauthorised. The Environment police was asked to remove these in the recent past. ??
?
?Boards steal attention away from driving??
Roland Abeypala,
- Senior professor of the Department of Educational Psychology?
- University of Colombo,
??Advertisements are attractive by nature and once a driver sees one, his attention scatters and he tends to think about the content in visual terms. A driver needs to concentrate to engage in the demanding task of driving. Some people just ignore the visual clutter of brightly lit roadside advertisements. The boards always steal attention away from the road and driving. Even red is used for roadside advertising in Sri Lanka near the busiest junctions on digital screens, specially in Colombo - areas such as Town Hall, near Arcade and Kollupitiya Junction. Erotic pictures are being used to attract passers-by, especially males. Compared with advertisements displayed in rural areas, busy towns and highly congested junctions have large and attractive boards which are dangerous to public safety. Roadside advertising is prohibited in developed countries such as Japan, Russia and Australia. India is similar to our country in roadside advertising, as films and political advertisements are among the largest of roadside banners and hoardings. Displaying huge boards and hoardings along roads is a sign of underdevelopment.? ?
?
?Annual permits will be required??
Manuja Wimalasena?
- Director of Legal Department - CEA?
?We are currently in the process of making rules and regulations according to National Environment Act. No 47 of 1980 - under section 32, as amended by 56 of 1988 and 56 of 2003, on roadside advertising, prominently for billboards, hoardings and other advertising methods. Now we are in the final stage of approving the draft. Once we have the necessary approval to further this draft, we expect to present it to the Parliament and immediately take action. We have received a case filed by an NGO asking for guidelines to be made for outdoor advertising including billboards and hoardings. The CEA took this a step further, adding that outdoor advertising should be regulated as well. Once these new regulations are in force, it is expected that roadside advertising boards and screens will need annual renewing permits. Those who put up unauthorised boards will be warned and then the boards will be removed, the legal director said, commenting on the future of outdoor advertising in Sri Lanka. According to the new regulations, the law will give the CEA the power to remove billboards and hoardings for the purpose of safety, security and other statutory requirements.?
?Hoardings spoil beautiful landscapes??
Irvin Weerackody?
- the Chairman of Pheonix Ogilvy advertising company?
?Outdoor advertising is no doubt quite effective as a medium. In some instances, billboards and hoardings distract motorists (drivers). With the beautification of the Colombo city, a large number of hoardings have been removed, which is indeed a good thing. In rural areas, some hoardings and billboards spoil the beautiful landscapes. In my view, local authorities must be mindful of this.??
We asked about the issue of the reduction of brightness from an employee of digital billboard maintenance service
?We can control all digital billboards under company maintenance through the head office. Usually all digital boards are controlled through software. Now there are many complaints about unadjusted brightness levels of digital billboards at night. If a responsible officer is in the head office at the time of a complaint, the brightness levels can be reduced to a comfortable level. We could dim the boards at night with the software we had by 2008.? ??
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
Sarath Ranaweera
?from Weligama ?It?s challenging to drive at night with the bright lights of these advertising boards and screens. We have to avoid looking at them. Billboards have to be informative, not distracting.? ??
?
?
Chanaka Solangaarachchi from Welisara
?Roadside advertising boards and LED screens are sometimes a distraction but most of the time I find them very helpful.? ?
?
?
Devni Dharmasena from Kelaniya?
?We don?t watch TV and therefore these outdoor advertising boards are helpful to catch up with things. It is all good to look at. But when talking about driving, they are too eye-catching.? ?
?
?
Indrani Wijewardena from Kandy
?It?s true that roadside advertising boards are attention-grabbing. Yet removing them from the roadside is not practical. We should go forward with the world, not backwards. It?s all right to situate them in places where they are not a distraction to drivers.? ??
?
?
Ria from India?
?Digital boards are not to be seen much here in Sri Lanka though. Sri Lanka has a long way to go in digital advertising.? ?
?
?
?
Dhanushka Medawela from Colombo?
?Advertising boards and digital billboards do not distract much during the day but they are too bright at night because the brightness levels are not controlled to suit natural light. Distractions caused by roadside advertisements could be fatal to riders. Therefore outdoor advertising screens and boards are a possible cause of accidents.? ??
?
Naren Bellala from London
?Roadside advertising is not the right way to advertise. Outdoor advertising like boards, posters and digital billboards should be limited to a certain period of time and most are situated in inappropriate places. The ads are not convincing to everybody. They should be allowed, yet the display should be for a limited period of time and then they should be removed.? ??
?
?
Sumith Hettiarachchi from Galle
?Luminous boards at bends and junctions are a threat to driving as the colours are unbearable to the eyes, especially at night. It is like begging for accidents. Sometimes, the boards and screens are helpful in finding locations.? ?
?
?
B.V Buddhika from Avissawella?
?Some boards are irritating to the eyes due to the bright lights and they take away the focus from the road as well. There?s a big advertising board at the bend of Aluth Ambalama in Awissawella, which disturbs drivers at night. Boards at bends are the most distracting. Vehicles risk hitting some of these boards and as we usually drive in the same direction daily, it is not a big issue for us but it could be for the novice drivers and strangers not used to cities.? ???
?
Harshan Hameer from Kiribathgoda?
?With these billboards, one can become distracted easily and the bright lights are disturbing at night. They are good for marketing but we are unable to focus on the road.? ?

British PM warns of ?politics of division?
	
AFP, 09th JANUARY, 2017- British Prime Minister Theresa May warned Monday that mainstream politicians must better address public concerns about inequality, immigration and globalization, or risk losing power to the ?politics?of division?.
Six months after she took office following Britain?s deeply divisive vote to leave the European Union, May said the government should step up to build a stronger, more cohesive society.
?We know what happens when mainstream centre-ground politics fails -- people embrace the fringe, the politics of division and despair,? the Conservative leader said in a major speech in London.
?They turn to those who offer easy answers, who claim to understand people?s problems, and always know what and who to blame.

He is a uniformed one decorated with stars exercising his sway in an area in the central hills. There is hush-hush in official circles that a video tape showing him stepping out of a bawdy house had found its way into the hands of higher authorities.
?
The bawdy house is said to be a well- known spot in the area and had been in ?business? for some time. The higher authorities had received reports that the place was never raided because the uniformed one himself was a frequent visitor to the place.?

?China and Sri Lanka are  inseparably linked nations? - Chinese academic
	
Renowned Chinese academic Prof. Ma Zhongwu, in an interview with the Daily Mirror, speaks about the importance of China-Sri Lanka relations in the current global climate for the mutual benefit of both sides. Prof. Ma, who is the Vice Dean of School of Asian and African studies and the Director of Centre for Sri Lanka Studies at Beijing?s Foreign Studies University, is a frequent traveller to Sri Lanka. He speaks fluent Sinhala and has done his post graduate and doctorate studies here. The excerpts of the interview which was conducted in the Sinhala language in Colombo.
"Although China is a big country compared to Sri Lanka, people of both the countries are aware of traditional friendship existing since ancient times. Both China and Sri Lanka want to cooperate with each other"
?
Q ?As an academic, how do you see the China-Sri Lanka relations?
When you talk about it, we cannot forget Bhikkhu Fa-hsien who travelled to Sri Lanka way back in the 5th century. There was a book called ?Record of the Buddhist Kingdoms? published. By reading it, we can learn about the religious, cultural and social situation in Sri Lanka at that time in the perspective of a foreign national. ??
Then, Cheng Ho, the great navigator, sailed westwards from China for seven times between 1405 and 1433. He sailed towards the western sea as we call, passing South-east Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, to East Africa. Many times he travelled past Sri Lanka which was located strategically on his route. It amounted to trade links beyond mere cultural affairs. Then, he should have established certain links with the local community and the local kings. Cheng Ho made an offering to a local temple, which has been recorded by inscription written on a stone tablet. This stone tablet was carved in three languages including Chinese, Tamil and Persian. Now it is preserved at the national museum of Sri Lanka in Colombo. ?
In my idea, China-Sri Lanka relations might have began even before that in the ancient period. Sri Lanka could have been accessed through land at that for China passing via India. Trade and religious links would have been fundamental. It would have happened even before the arrival of Fa-hsien, but may be at a minimal scale. During the period of different dynasties in China, many monks, apart from Fa-hsien, had visited Sri Lanka to study Buddhism. It is mentioned in Chinese ancient history books, link BookofLiang, Book of Song. China- Sri Lanka relations were constrained after Sri Lanka was colonized by the western powers. Only after Sri Lanka gained Independence and the People?s Republic of China was established, relationship resumed. ??
Q ?How do you see the importance of relations between the two ?countries at the moment?
I am a Chinese national. Likewise, I did my final year studies for my degree at the University of Kelaniya. I also did my post graduate and doctorate here in the same university and I express my view not as someone with close links with your country. Although China is a big country compared to Sri Lanka, people of both the countries are aware of traditional friendship existing since ancient times. Both China and Sri Lanka want to cooperate with each other. China has launched ? the Belt and Road Initiatives?. We proceed with it in a spirit of mutual cooperation with the countries involved. It is launched in a mutually beneficial manner. That is why the countries concerned cooperated with it. It was proposed in 2013. Sri Lanka is one among the very first countries that agreed and extended cooperation with the project. Sri Lanka is strategically located on this project route linking the East and the West. Now you know, there is no financial hub between Hong Kong in the East and Dubai towards the West. If Sri Lanka teams up with ?the Belt and Road Initiatives?, Sri Lanka can benefit from it for its economic development. The Port City project or the International Financial City project as it is called now, is important for Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka should open its doors and welcome investors from all over the world. ??
As for Hong Kong, why is it popular all over the world? Nobody was opposed to it. It is part of Chinese administration and enjoying in developing its economy with sufficient freedom. This is a concept for economic development. People should be made aware of it. Investors from any part of the world can invest in it. Isn?t it good for Sri Lanka? ?
Fa-hsien visited Sri Lanka to study Buddhism
Q ?How important is Sri Lanka for China in terms of maritime security?
I do not comment on how important it is for China. It is absurd giving water to someone who is not thirsty; it is needed for someone who is thirsty. For anything to become important, there should be mutual requirement. Had you looked at the ancient silk road, it was a success. Because it was devoid of political interest. Only trade interests remained in ancient times. Sea craft, with items such as silk cloth and ceramic products, voyaged from China. Here in Sri Lanka, you had cinnamon, spices and gems. Trading in goods happened in this manner. Today, the situation is very complex. Problems arise due to influence. It is better to work out arrangements in a manner that is mutually beneficial. It has to be done in a spirit of understanding each others? needs. Sri Lanka has its own plan for development. China too has its own. Before I comment on Sri Lanka?s significance to China, I would like to say that China is also important for Sri Lanka. It is mutual dependence, not unilateral. We are inseparably linked nations. ?
?
"As I remember, as for the suspension of some Chinese projects in Sri Lanka, there were different interpretations on that. Some of them are pessimistic and even extreme"
?
Although some Chinese projects were suspended during the last one or two years, I think it was a temporary issue. It may be due to misunderstanding. When two friends meet for the first time, there is no mutual understanding. It develops gradually with the passage of time. Misunderstanding emerges even among friends. With the passage of time, it is possible to identify genuine friends. Wife and husband also quarrel in a family. Nevertheless, it should not end up in divorce. We are very happy to see that both sides have already found out the reasons for misunderstanding and have found tangible solutions. Together we could mark the 60th anniversary of establishing bilateral relations and 65th anniversary of the Rubber and Rice Pact between the two countries in 2017. ??
Q ?How do you analyse the evolution of bilateral relations over these 60 years?
I look at things positively. The two countries signed the Rubber-Rice Pact in 1952 even before diplomatic relations were established. We established diplomatic relations only in 1957. Ours are Asian countries bound by common cultural ties. China and Sri Lanka are different in land size, nations and social system. But during the past 60 years, with the support of the great people and under the guidance of the leaders of our two countries, we did set a good example to the rest of the world to cultivate a profound friendship between a big country and a small country. ?
Proposed Maritime Silk Route
Q ?How do you look at?cultural ties?
When I am in Sri Lanka, like now, I talk with you, I do not feel as such that I am on a foreign soil. We have common hospitality traditions. That is visible when I go to see my friends here. For instance, when I go out for a meal with local friends, the hosts try to pay the bill without allowing me to contribute even. In China too, we do the same. In the western countries, it is different. If two people, even two good friends have a meal together, the bill may be shared equally. Apart from that we have religious links. Sri Lanka is a Buddhist country. In China, the main religion also has been Buddhism. We have the Confucius Philosophy. Besides, both these philosophy and Buddhism are not in conflict with each other. Both are intertwined and influenced by each other. Buddhism is not very stringently followed in China, unlike in Sri Lanka. Some People are not that ritualistic. In the hearts and minds of people in China, there is, however, a great respect for Buddhism. Though they do not sometimes identify themselves as Buddhists, they follow the Buddhist way of thinking and conducting themselves. Buddhist culture is a very important part of China. In Sri Lanka, Buddhism and the Sinhalese culture are entwined. Without Buddhism, there is no Sinhala culture. It is no so in China, though. But, Buddhist influence is visible in all our aspects of life in China. ??
Q ?What should be done more to foster ties between the two countries?
Though relationship was strained a little bit in the recent past, I do not think it would lead to any major issue. People in Sri Lanka should be asked whether the relationship with China is important for them. Actually, we need each other. There is no issue here, but a little misunderstanding. Public awareness has to be created in the future. Traditional friendship will not suffer. Understanding is the key to development and foster ties. ??
I visit Sri Lanka a number of times in a year. Most countries in the world tie up with China in the present context. Not only Asian countries but also European countries cooperate with China. They propose to work with us. The world has evolved to be one whole village virtually. In the western world, they eat with forks and spoons. In Sri Lanka, you use your hands to eat food. We, in China, use chopsticks. So we have to first understand the cultural diversity of human beings and then pay enough respect to each other. The best way to understand each other is to improve people to people contacts, alongside strengthening diplomatic relations. More they visit China, better they have an understanding about the country. It would lead to a positive outcome. More and more people should be afforded the opportunity to visit China. More and more Chinese nationals should be allowed to come here. ?
As I remember, as for the suspension of some Chinese projects in Sri Lanka, there were different interpretations on that. Some of them are pessimistic and even extreme. My friends inquired about it from me. I told them that there was no major issue involved here. I know Sri Lanka and its people because I have travelled here often. ??
Port City Project
Q ?There is fear that the Chinese presence would pose a threat to some other countries in Sri Lanka?s neighbourhood. What are your views?
This is a myth and deliberately created in my view. Chinese nationals travel to Singapore, the UK, Australia, Canada and even the USA. Do you know how many Chinese students are studying in the UK? As I know, in England, the Chinese language was introduced to the school curriculum more than 15 years before. They realized the importance of learning Chinese language. Nobody questions the presence of Chinese students or Chinese people there. Conversely, Now Chinese investors are welcome to most of the countries all over the world. In my view, Chinese nationals, coming to Sri Lanka, obey the law of this country. They mostly do their business activities here. Like me, I come here for education purposes. ??
I will give one small example for your reference and understanding my point. If I open an eatery, I do not mind who the nationalities are my customers. The operator of the next eatery may wonder how I attract so many customers. It may be due to my quality service or reasonable rates. Nobody can find faults with it. If more people - no matter which nationalities come to Sri Lanka - it may be due to what Sri Lanka offers. ??
Sri Lanka has to consider what it needs for future development. It should bring more foreign direct investment. When Sri Lanka does something, the country?s interest should be given the pride of place. Whatever government comes to power, the country?s interests should take precedence above all. People centric approach is strongly advisable. People are not ignorant. They will realize what is needed. ??
The Sri Lankan people and government should seriously think about the future of the country and find out their own development path and style which is better suit the recent national condition without any hesitation to any other external influence. ? ?

Chinese foreign and maritime policies changed since 2009  - Japanese Scholar
	
In the playout of balance of power in the Indian Ocean region, Sri Lanka?s strategic location abutting a major sea trade artery has drawn the attention of the world powers since ancient times. In this context, the role and involvement of countries such as the United States, China and India in Sri Lanka are looked at from a geopolitical angle. ?
Currently, the Chinese role is discussed and debated over plans by the government to hand over an 85% stake of the Hambantota Port to a Chinese Company named ?China Merchants?. Against this backdrop, it looks pertinent to shed some light on the evolution of China?s foreign policy under the Private Public Partnership model.?
Prof. ?Kawashima delivered a lecture titled ?China?s foreign policy and India-Pacific Region? at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies. In it, he described how China?s foreign policy, starting from modern diplomacy aimed at restoring national rights and territories, evolved over the decades. He said China focused socialist diplomacy between 1949 and 1970 and then diplomacy for between 1980 and 2008. Then, it evolved its diplomacy as a great power. According to this Japanese professor, China underwent transition from its main slogan after 1990s. It adopted the slogan ?Hiding one?s talents and biding one?s time?. ??
?
?
"Historically, China is a land power, though China sent Zheng He in Ming dynasty. And PRC and PLA basically made land-based nation-building. But China needs to protect its coastal area that is the centre of industries and the richest in China, and has to keep its sea lane of resources and security. China also signed and ratified the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, but it has a unique concept about the sea, like blue territory"
?
He said China strengthened the importance of sovereignty and security, as well as development. That country displayed flexibility on territorial issues to some extent, like action plan in South China Sea in 2002. And China solved most of land territorial issues in 1990s. ?
?However, in 2006-2008, China adjusted its slogan. Then, prospect of Chinese economic growth indicated China changed to be a second largest economic power soon. And conservative socialists strengthened more aggressive foreign policy. Former Chinese President Wen Jiabao insisted on keeping original policy, because he thought China still needed economic growth,? he said.
He said, in 2009, Chinese foreign and maritime policies apparently changed. ??
?Historically, China is a land power, though China sent Zheng He in Ming dynasty. And PRC and PLA basically made land-based nation-building. But China needs to protect its coastal area that is the centre of industries and the richest in China, and has to keep its sea lane of resources and security. China also signed and ratified the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, but it has a unique concept about the sea, like blue territory,? he said. ?
Referring to current President Xi Jingping?s administration, foreign policy he said ?Xi is conscious that China is the second largest power in the world, but simultaneously understands it?s difficult for China to be a global super power soon,? he said. ?
?
"Shin Kawashima, is a Professor of the University of Tokyo delivered a ?lecture titled ?China?s foreign policy and India-Pacific ?Region? at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations ?and Strategic Studies"
?
Commenting on President Xi?s approach on Asia, he said Xi proposed the concept of Asia, on New Concept of Asian Security. This concept excludes USA, and strengthens Chinese initiative. Xi?s China provides a series of regional common goods, like AIIB, as a great power in this region. ?
Such a strategy has a domestic background. China has to express CCP realized ?greater China? to keep its legitimacy, and has to cope with the problems of over production and national enterprises,? he said. ??
In the light of such comments and remarks by the Japanese scholar, China?s present engagements with Sri Lanka look bent more on economic and maritime cooperation. It launched its global trade expansion project called ?One belt, one route? in 2013. It is even called the 21st century maritime silk route, modelled on the ancient silk route that facilitated trade across the globe. Hambantota Port is located just four nautical miles off the main trade artery that carries a bulk of products manufactured in the countries such as South Korea, Japan, and China etc to the markets in the Middle East or the western world. Alongside, it is a key trade link supplying much needed fuel from the Middle East to the other side. So, a port in Hambantota will be important, mainly in the provision of services to the ships passing by. ??

"In 2006-2008, China adjusted its slogan. Then, prospect of Chinese economic growth indicated?
China changed to be a second largest economic power soon. And conservative socialists strengthened more aggressive foreign policy"
?
However, the signing of the agreement for the port project has been postponed indefinitely amidst pressure emanating from various quotes. It is learnt that Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) headed by President Maithripala Sirisena is not in favour of the criterion adopted in leasing out the port. Instead of an 85% stake, the President?s SLFP is for a lesser percentage for the Chinese company. Also, the public protest has built up against the acquisition of land on a large scale for the port related industrial zone. ??
In the meantime, the Joint Opposition, acting under the leadership of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa also requested the President in writing to postpone the signing of the agreement. ??
It outlined the following reasons for it: ??
?
"Xi is conscious that China is the second largest power in the world, but simultaneously understands it?s difficult for China to be a global super power soon"
?
1 ?? ?The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), in September 2014, entered into an agreement with the China Merchant Holdings (International) Company Ltd, and China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd, to lease the Hambantota Port (Phase II) on a supply, operate and transfer (SOT) basis for 35 years. However, this agreement was nullified. Subsequently, China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd, and China Merchant Ports Holding Company Ltd, tendered separate proposals without the criteria for their selection having been defined. ?
?
2 ?China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd proposed an initial payment of approximately US$ 730 million for a 50-year lease period, during which a payment structure similar to a royalty was proposed, which made the value of this proposal in fact US$ 1.5 billion. This was reportedly the option preferred by the SLPA, which would have benefited the country and the SLPA. However, the option selected was the proposal of China Merchant Ports Holding Company, for a one-time payment of US$ 1.08 billion, for a 99-year lease, extendable for a further 99 years. The question arises as to why China Merchant Ports Holding Company was selected, and who selected it. ?
?
3?? ?The project has been valued at US$ 1.4 billion by the SLPA. The question arises as to what basis was used to arrive at this figure. As far as we know, no proper valuation has been done of the Hambantota Port facilities, infrastructure and land (including the 110 acre island), but only construction costs have been taken into consideration, so the agreement is based on an undervaluation of the assets. ?
?
4?? ?The Attorney General has given his opinion that articles 4, 5, 8 and 16 of the agreement are beyond the scope and/or the statutory powers vested with the SLPA. ?
?
5?? ?The China Merchant Ports Holding Company Ltd has agreed to invest US$ 1.12 billion in the joint venture project, paying US$ 5 million as a security deposit, 10% of the investment value, including the security deposit, within one month; 30% of the investment value within 3 months and 60% of the investment value within 6 months. According to the agreement, these funds are to be invested in the project itself. The Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) has agreed to be responsible for the debts of the SLPA, so the joint venture will not be responsible ? in the event of the project going bankrupt, GoSL would still have to pay the debts. ?
?
6 ? The SLPA suggested a share split in the original proposed joint venture company, , but this was subsequently changed by the Government to 80% to China Merchant Ports Holding Company Ltd and 20% to the SLPA. The question arises as to how, why and on what basis all these critical calculations and changes were made by the Government. ?
?
7?? ?No proper due diligence has been carried out on the project. ?
?
8?? ?The Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee (CANC) was not given sufficient time and had not followed laid down procedures to study the proposals and make adequate recommendations. ?
?
9?? ?Granting of 15,000 acres adjacent to the Hambantota Port which would deprive farmers of their lands have no justification. ?
?
10 ? The SLPA Board cannot give its approval to the project and above mentioned according to the SLPA Act. ?
The JOT wrote, ?It is proposed to grant a lease of the Hambantota Port to the China Merchant Ports Holding Company for 99 years + 99 years, totalling up to 198 years. Such a vital asset should not be entered into lightly, and should be given due consideration.??

Deputy Inspector General of Police Priyantha Jayakody has been appointed as the Police Media Spokesman, the Law & Order and Southern Development Ministry said today.
Ministry Secretary Jagath P Wijeweera said the vacant post had lead to the publication of misleading news stories in the recent past.
The Ministry had adopted a new policy when dealing with the media, the Secretary said. While the police is cleared to issue reports on certain subjects, the ministry will tend to national and international issues, policy decisions and controversial issues.
Meanwhile DIG Jayakody said the police will release news concerning arrests, drug busts, measures taken to eradicate crimes and anything to do with civil security and accidents.
?Selected policemen across the island will also be trained to research and compile news items, which will then be approved by the ministry before it is released,? he said??? ?

H'tota deal not the best for SL: MR
	
While claiming that the agreement negotiated by his government with China to manage the Hambantota Port is the best deal yet, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said today this government has failed to get the best deal for Sri Lanka.
Mr. Rajapaksa said he had no issue with China or any foreign investors but was concerned about what?s best for the country and getting the best deal for it.
In a statement explaining the plans of the Rajapaksa Government to develop the port and to repay the loan obtained, he said the government has chosen the least favourable bid.
?The previous agreement, that my government negotiated with the China Harbour Co and China Merchant Co to manage the Hambantota container terminal for 40 years, is the best deal yet. According to information, the government has chosen the least favourable bid despite the Ports Authority having recommended the other bidder,? he said.
He said the current bid has been accepted in a situation where the other company, the China Harbour Co., had put up a more favourable bid to lease the free port on a 65-35 equity sharing basis for 50 years with an upfront payment of 750 million USD.
Mr. Rajapaksa said the new government has made some unwise decisions by disregarding several profitable agreements made by his government.
?The management contract for the Hambantota container terminal entered into by my government with China Harbour Co and China Merchant Co was cancelled. Then, the Ports Authority had developed the Colombo East container terminal and upon its completion by 2016, this terminal would have produced a revenue of more than 100 million USD a year which the Ports Authority had earmarked to pay off the Hambantota loan until the latter generated sufficient income. The 'yahapalana' government halted the Colombo East terminal development,? he said.
He said he was against the leasing of the entire harbour for 99 years and giving the rights of a landlord over the industrial zone to a foreign private company.
"The industrial zone and the harbour should be controlled by the Ports Authority while harbour operations may be given on management contracts to the private sector. The Colombo port is run by the Ports Authority and two private operators. The Ports Authority has full control over the Colombo harbour as well as equity in the two privately run terminals. I believe this should be the approach to the Hambantota port as well,? he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa reiterated that the Hambantota Port made an operating profit of Rs.900 million in 2014 and Rs.1.2 billion in 2015.
?These are investments that last centuries and a new harbour cannot be expected to produce large profits in the first few years. Our plan was to break even within ten years,? he said.
Commenting on the Southern Industrial Zone, he said the total land area of all the Board of Investment economic zones in the country do not amount to 2,000 hectares and as such a 15,000 acre-zone in Hambantota will be disproportionate to the country?s economy.
He said the government should fill the free port with investments first before opening more zones.
?This is not an issue that can be resolved by baton-charging or tear gassing protesters or having them assaulted by thugs and remanded. There are real issues relating to the financial benefits that will accrue to the country from this deal, and issues of control and sovereignty over the free port and possible environmental issues that need to be addressed,? Mr. Rajapaksa said.

Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone gave very emotional speeches as they led La La Land to a very impressive record-breaking showing at the Golden Globes. ??
The two stars each accepted the Best Performance by an Actor and Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy gongs while the musical as a whole took the Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy award for a clean sweep of seven gongs at the event held at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. ?

The ceremony featured several references to Mr Trump - not least when Meryl Streep launched an attack on the US President-elect while accepting the Cecil B Demille award for outstanding contribution to entertainment. ?
Meryl Streep was honoured at the Golden Globes for a lifetime of notable work, and used her moment in the spotlight to attack on US President-elect Donald Trump, without mentioning him by name, by calling the moment the president-elect mocked a disabled reporter the most stunning performance of the year. ??
?There was nothing good about it, but it did its job,? Streep said in the powerful speech that left many teary-eyed.?It was that moment when a person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter -someone he outranked in privilege, in power and in the capacity to fight back. ??

IGP Jayasundara when answering a call was reported to have said that he had asked the FCID not to arrest anyone without his permission.
President Maithripala Sirisena told Parliament last month that he had called for an explanation from the IGP.
?If I was told to conduct an investigation into the matter, I will do so. I could have launched a normal investigation. But the IGP is a responsible person in the country who has been appointed by the President and Parliament.

Pakistan test-fires first nuclear-capable submarine cruise missile
	
ISLAMABAD AFP Jan9,?
2017 - Pakistan on Monday test-fired its first submarine-launched cruise missile, capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and giving the country a credible second strike capability, the military said. ?
The missile was fired from an underwater mobile platform and hit its target with precise accuracy, it said in a statement. ?
A military spokesman confirmed to AFP the missile, with a range of 450 km (280 miles), could carry a nuclear warhead. ?
??Babur-3 is a sea-based variant of Ground Launched Cruise Missile (GLCM) Babur-2, which was successfully tested earlier in December, last year,? the statement said. ?
??Pakistan eyes this hallmark development as a step toward reinforcing the policy of credible minimum deterrence.? Pakistan and neighbouring India -- which have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947 -- have routinely carried out missile tests since both demonstrated a nuclear weapons capability in 1998. ?
Both countries can already launch surface-to-surface ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear or conventional warheads. ?

Ravi named Finance Minister of year, Asia-Pacific
	
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake has been selected as the Finance Minister of the Year for Asia-Pacific by the prestigious ?The Banker? magazine for his efforts to steer Sri Lanka into a new era of economic reform and a change of mindset, the Finance Ministry today said.
The Banker is an international financial publication published in London and it selects finance ministers who have best managed to stimulate growth and stabilize the economy of their countries. ?
Accordingly, Sri Lankan Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake has been selected for the 2016. ?
According to a statement issued by the ministry, The Banker has said Karunanayake secured a $ 1.5 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan program that the country needed to avoid a balance of payments crisis, replenish reserves and rebuild confidence among international investors.
Sri Lanka?s latest bond issues in the international capital markets suggest Karunanayake has indeed reached his objective. In 2015, the sovereign issued a $ 1.5 billion dual-tranche note.
A year later, it printed a second bond of the same size, with order books of $ 6.6 billion, despite market volatility after the UK voted to leave the EU.
Sri Lanka is also working towards fiscal consolidation. Sri Lanka?s budget deficit has dropped from 7% when Karunanayake took office in January 2015 to 5.4% in 2016 ? below the targeted expectations of 5.6%.
After a visit in September 2016, the IMF said Sri Lanka?s tightening of fiscal and monetary policies has been effective and that it met the IMF program?s targets through to the end of June 2016.
According to latest Sri Lanka?s total government revenue grew from Rs. 1205 in 2014 to Rs. 1,461 billion in 2015. Tax revenue rose from Rs. 1,050 billion to Rs. 1,356 billion in the same period. This is crucial for Sri Lanka, which has a very low tax revenue-to-gross domestic product ratio.
To raise tax revenue further, Parliament passed a bill to increase value-added tax from 11% to 15%. Karunanayake is also keen to continue simplifying the tax system as well as change people?s mindset towards taxes.
But even without expected revenue from the increased VAT due to its late implementation the Finance ministry was able to increase the national revenue to 13.5% the GDP in 2016 from 11.4% in 2014 thus making it possible to cover the recurrent expenditure.
The gout inculcated in the minds of the people that paying taxes is not something bad, but a must for the country. Every person needs to pay a reasonable charge instead of relying on the Government for everything. As a result, Sri Lanka?s tax records have grown from having 700,000 files in January 2015 to having 1.4 million today, the statement said.
