Avant-Garde floating armoury inquiry begins
	
Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara today allowed the defence counsel to file preliminary objections on March 15 in the case where former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Nissanka Senadhipathi and six others were facing corruption charges filed by the Bribery Commission with regard to Avant Garde Maritime Services Ltd.
The BC said the suspects had committed an offence by permitting the the company to operate a floating armoury causing a Rs.11.4 billion financial loss to the State.
The six suspects are: Sujatha Damayanthi, Palitha Piyasiri Fernando, Karunaratne Bandara Adhikarai, Somathilaka Dissanayake, Jayanath Sirikumara Colambage and Jayantha Perera.
In a preliminary objection, Romesh de Silva PC said the prosecution had violated the law vested in Bribery Act (BA) when charging the suspects.
He said the when the suspects were charged under Section 70 of the Bribery Act, the prosecution should have obtained a mandatory sanction, a written consent, from the BC according to its Section 78 (1).
However, in this case there was no such sanction in court, therefore, the proceedings should not be continued, and the suspects discharged from the inquiry.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara prosecuting said according to the Section 11, No.19 of the 1994 Bribery Act, the Director General of the BC was permitted to file charges in court without certification of the BC because the direction was sufficient compliance.
The Magistrate directed the prosecution to conduct the inquiry in the absence of the second accused Sujatha Damayanthi Jayaratne following the evidence led by the prosecution confirming that the suspect was abroad. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Colossal farce or an act of gratification
	
Keppetipola made a hero after Nine Score years and Nineteen 
we cannot dedicate, we cannot desecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated far above our poor power to add or detract
-Extract from Gettysburg address by Abraham Lincoln, 16th President of the USA.
The President deserves praise for de-gazetting or posthumously awarding medals for personal acts of valour above and beyond the call of duty for their heroic acts and meritorious services against invaders in the past while running a unity government with someone who once initiated a plan to celebrate the 500th Anniversary of Portuguese invasion during his short stint as Prime Minister in 2001-2004. 
Rajapaksa Wickramasekera Mudiyanselage Bandaranayake Monarawila Keppetipola [Monarawila Keppetipola Dissawe] was the leader of the Uva rebellion 199 years ago. Keppetipola was sent with 500 men by Governor Brownrigg to suppress the rebellion. However, at the request of the rebels, Keppetipola joined them to lead the struggle. His men joined him too. Keppetipola returned the British arms and ammunition to the Governor. The rebellion began in Uva-Wellassa on October 12, 1817 spread to Dumbara, Hewaheta, Harisspattuwa and Nuwara-Kala-Viya, was a great success until it was broken with the disbanding of the rebels. Two new army divisions, including an Indian one were dispatched to Uva by Governor immediately after the news that Keppetipola had joined the rebels. 
Wilbawe Doresamy was formally crowned by the rebels. Keppetipola was appointed as the Maha Adhikaram (Chief Minister) and the new King urged the fighters to free the country from the invading British. A guerrilla war was waged by Keppetipola, though aware that the rebels were lesser in firepower. 
On January 10, 1818, Governor Brownrigg castigated Keppetipola and several other leaders of the uprising as outlaws, rebels, and enemies to the crown through a gazette and they were found guilty of high treason, and their properties were confiscated. 
Keppetipola captured and executed 
Keppetipola along with Pilimathalawe were captured by Captain ONeil On October 28, 1818. As the troops surrounded the house, Keppitipola boldly came out and greeted Capt. ONeil; he was taken to Kandy, and tried for high treason and sentenced to death in a gruesome crime of history. This national hero is well known for the exceptional bravery that he showed at the instant of his execution, and has been honoured as a national hero of Sri Lanka since then. Honouring their memory, of course is an exercise in generosity. His skull was taken to London by the colonial authorities, but was returned to Ceylon on February 9, 1948; a few days after the declaration of Independence. 
In 1813, the colonial office recommended Robert Brownrigg appointed as Governor of Ceylon. In 1815, he acquired Central hills of this island through a treaty known as the Kandyan Convention assisted by the defecting ministers of the King, and annexed it to the British Empire, which they thought  on which the sun never sets, since its spread around the globe meant that the sun was always visible in at least one of its colonies. [it was Dr. Colvin R. de Silva who once said, Yes, the sun never sets in British Empire, because God never trusted them in the dark]. 
Another mass de-gazetting planned for March 1 for the rest 
The genocidal policy of the colonial British during the Great Rebellion of 1818 recognized his achievements; Brownrigg was honoured with the hereditary title by the British Crown in 1816. Brownrigg who defeated the 1818 Rebellion and ordered the beheading of Keppetipola, attained the rank of General before leaving the colony in 1819. [The organizers of the ceremony may revoke the above two gazettes as well before they wind up the de-gazetting process].
It was reported that another mass de-gazetting was planned for March 1 for the rest of the national heroes, to be held in the Maligawa precincts, Kandy. 
There had been many national, cultural, and political massacres, butchery and slaughter committed by the British and other colonial powers who ruled for 443 years from 1505 to 1948. The Badulla atrocity undertaken by Robert Brownrigg involved the slaughter of adults and children, including babies suckling at the mothers breasts. They destroyed their paddy cultivation the irrigation schemes and other infrastructure as well. 
Gettysburg address 
The historical Gettysburg address delivered on November 19, 1863, by Lincoln, [whos four years in office is regarded by historians as the most critical period in American history], was made at the dedication ceremony of Soldiers National Cemetery at Gettysburg, in Pennsylvania, the place where one of the worst battles in American civil war was fought which left over 7000 men dead. [The speech conveys a message to our organizers of de-gazetting ceremonies]. The Union Army defeated confederation. The classic speech demonstrating mastery of thought and expression is generally accepted as one of the most enduring addresses ever delivered by the lips of a man. 
Dedicating the cemetery to the war heroes, Lincoln began with the now iconic phrase, 
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. We are met on a great battle field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of the field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.


"Keppetipola along with Pilimathalawe were captured by Captain ONeil On October 28, 1818. As the troops surrounded the house, Keppitipola boldly came out and greeted Capt. ONeil; he was taken to Kandy, and tried for high treason and sentenced to death in a gruesome crime of history"

It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. ButIn a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot desecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated far above our poor power to add or detract.
The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did there. that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vein - that this nation, shall have a new birth of freedom- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
Lincoln took nearly two weeks to prepare the small speech, lasting just under three minutes. Our national leaders have lacked the courage to write their own speeches. They depend on social scientists. These people have dominated state strategy with incompetent and unproven academic theories. 

Unnecessary, if not farcical 
There is no way of undoing these grave injustices. Reversing the record on these shameful crime is farcical and the government needs to concentrate on burning issues of the day instead of wasting everybodys time. The British authorities may have condemned the 1818 rebellion leaders Keppetipola and 18 others as traitors through a Gazette. It is an unnecessary exercise to expose this disgraceful obsolete and archaic British document and trounce it. Those who advised the government to dwell upon erasing the British gazette have resorted to publicity feats. If it necessitates erasing even a small part of the colonial legacy it is an act of distortion of history- besides everything else. 
It is an act of remembering people who had their own personal concerns, individual ambitions to live peaceful lives. But being confronted with events that affected not just them, but the nation, yet, they could have chosen to remain focused on their personal battles, ignoring what was going on around them. They set aside their personal agendas, their fears, they did not waver. They knew that if they did not use their strength to resist it, then the abuse and violence would continue. These are the people we consider heroes. 
After all they say - heroes are people like you and me who were placed in unexpected situations, and yet, still preferred to do what is right; do they need Gazettes to become heroes 
The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example.- Benjamin Disraeli.

Drought: Be prepared, warns WFP
	
Sri Lanka should be prepared to face challenges ahead, especially when it comes to food security, which would be brought on by the drought, World Food Program (WFP) Executive Director Ertharin Cousin said over the weekend.
According to the WFP, which quoted a research carried out by several agencies including the Irrigation Department and the Department of Census and Statics, Sri Lanka has currently felt only 50 percent of the effect of the prevailing drought.
"You have to get your resources in place if you are to face challenges which are ahead of you in the wake of the drought. Without resources you cannot ensure food security," Ms. Cousin told journalists during her visit to Hambegamuwa in the Moneragala District.
She also stressed for a joint effort of all stakeholders to ensure success.
"I met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Davos earlier this year and he asked for WFP support to face the drought his country was going to face and I told him that we would support but the role of the Government and others would be important as one agency alone could not fulfill the task, she said.
She said she was pleased to see the work done in Sri Lanka, especially by the WFP.
The WFP has funded Rs. 6 million to put up a 15 km electricity fence and to grow thorny bushes such as Hana, Bougainvillea and lime to prevent elephants from destroying the lives and crops in Hambegamuwa.
There is a shortage of water for cultivation as a result of the focus on drinking water.
The storage of water has declined in several districts. It has been revealed that water storage in the Anuradhapura District has declined to 27 percent of the full capacity, while it is 28 percent in Moneragala, 28 percent in Trincomalee, and 57 percent in Polonnaruwa, reports said.(Yohan Perera)

GMOA accuses Rajitha of not gazetting minimum standards
	
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) today accused Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne of failing to gazette the minimum standards for medical education to prevent the substandard level of education provided by SAITM from being revealed.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Haritha Aluthge said the minimum standard for medical education should be gazetted so as to maintain a proper standard for the health sector.
He said they requested the President to take steps to suspend the admission of new students to SAITM and that they were monitoring the action being taken.
GMOA Secretary Navin De Zoysa said the health minister had failed to carry out his duties as the responsible authority and while an MP back then had disrupted moves made by former health ministers Nimal Siripala de Silva and Maithripala Sirisena to get the minimum standards approved in parliament.
The Hansard mentions the attempts taken by the health minister to prevent the minimum standards being approved in parliament," he said.
Dr. De Zoysa said GMOA had written to the health minister regarding several issues including the gazetting of minimum standards and added that they would resort to trade union action if there was no positive response to their demands.
When asked whether they were against the private medical institutions, he said it was up to the government to decide and added that it should be done in consultation with a panel of experts and based on the minimum standards. (Ajith Siriwardana)

GYPSY Swan Song
	
A group of Sri Lankan gypsies, members of a small and vulnerable community, has been spotted near some less crowded railway stations recently. We followed their trail in search of their origins and social hardships. The gypsies struggle hard to retain their identity without getting absorbed into the majority. They have always been a group apart even though they have adopted to the general culture of the country. 

Entertaining for a living
Pix by Damith Wickramasinghe
We noticed them temporarily sheltered near Yagoda and Bulugahagoda stations. Their huts were made using Gliricidia trunks and covered with rough black polythene; they looked like black igloo huts. Cardboard and artificial mats were used as flooring while in some huts the raw earth was visible. 
They had very few utensils. At the innermost corner of each hut, there was a covered area probably with their clothes and valuables. This hut is called Na Illa which means the house of the snake. Their name is also connected with the snake, as the Sinhalese term for them Ahikuntika means snake dancer. (Ahi - snake and Kuntika  dancing). 
The women may be mistaken for Tamils. They wear saris, chew betel and travel to adjacent villages soothsaying and collecting clothes, provisions and money. Gypsy males wear sarong and pass for estate workers. They entertain people with monkeys and snakes for shows at markets and crowded places. 
Gypsies are believed to have originated from Andhra Pradesh in ancient India; some groups may have migrated to other parts of the world and to Europe, adopting to the cultures. In Spain, Portugal, Germany and other European countries, the gypsy community has become a unique sub group with a different identity. They are famous for music and attractive dances like the flamenco. Constantly travelling in wagons, some of them are supposed to have connections with the underworld and some are deemed to be anti social. But with their lively music and dancing, gypsies have contributed and influenced Western literature, music and cinema. 

"The women may be mistaken for Tamils. They wear saris, chew betel and travel to adjacent villages sooth saying and collecting clothes, provisions and money. Gypsy males wear sarong and they may pass for estate workers. They entertain people with monkeys and snakes for shows at markets and crowded places"

Meanwhile in Sri Lanka, the gypsy community has quite a different socio-cultural portfolio vis-a-vis their western counterparts. They have been profoundly adapted to the majority society apart from their itinerant routine and their traditional ways of livelihood. Their crisis is similar to what is faced by the Adivasi (Veddah) community. According to the gypsies we met, their heritage has become an extra means of living to them which they are readily marketing. 
All these communities with markedly different cultures such as the Adivasis, Kaffirs and these gypsies have understood their market value and they even asked money from us for interviewing them. Wherever the gypsy community is, they have adapted to the environment, people, mode of transport and basic living conditions. 
Sri Lankan gypsies are seen in the North Central, North Western, Eastern and Sabaragamuwa Provinces. Some gypsy families were settled near Kala Wewa Bank by the Mahaweli Development Project in 1976 and later, a few more families were settled close to the Rajanganaya Reservoir. Yet another group of 25 families were given Sri Lankan identity and they were settled near Kudagama in Anuradhapura with land and paddy cultivations of 2.5 acres. There are people of Sinhala nationality as well as Telugu speakers and their religion is either Buddhism or Christianity. All the families have separate houses for each and the houses are facilitated with modern technology. 
A peek into their temporary huts
Hardships of a wandering life
Daasilage Raja from Kudagama, Thulana, commented about their hardships, challenges and fears. Im taking a monkey, snake and a python to shows and I go all around the country, especially to Colombo, to entertain foreigners. 
When asked why they did not stop their regular travelling, Raja said: Its our means of living except for the paddy we have in our villages. I have two kids for whom I want to give a better life. One of them is in ill health due to a neuron decease. I myself have to work hard to pay for my kids treatment which I have done so far. We are travelling due to lifes hardships and its not a joy ride for us. 
Speaking about the threats to their wandering life, Raja says that the gypsies that live in Puttalam who are being called Ranna are ruining their honour by performing immoral acts. 
Even though our origin is the same, Ranna people are quite different from us. They have professions such as sharpening knives but do a lot of stealing. Some of them are living in rented houses in Ja Ela as we heard and their little ones are used as pick pockets and for stealing. Anyway, we are the ones who get caught for their misdeeds.
Then the police arrest us and get our finger prints. If one in the whole gypsy clan performs an immoral or illegal act, the one with finger prints gets arrested. Recently I was arrested by the Ganemulla Police and they kept me till midday of the following day without any accusation. I asked them the reason behind my arrest, and they said;  We are jobless and thats why. 
A meagre living
We earn about Rs.500 to 600 on a weekday, and 2000 during weekends. Our business has fewer customers now and therefore its immensely difficult to earn with our traditional professions. Thats one of the reasons why our people turn to foreigners and travel to cities like Colombo. 
 I am 41 years. My mother is Engatakka, and I have six siblings. Im married and have twins. My daughter does O/L examination this year, she is gifted at her studies and she is a member of school Kabaddi team too. Im spending my earnings for my kids. I was schooled only till grade 5, and at that time our parents used to be alcoholics.
Our kids lives are much better than what we had and I am happy about that to some extent. 
There are several families with our relatives; my sister, our uncle, aunt and some other people are here with us. We rode donkeys in the past but now we have switched to trains as it is an easy way of transportation. 
We charge according to the place we are having shows. There are times when we charge Rs:150 or 200 from poor people. From the rich, we ask for 500 or 1000 but it depends. 
Breastfeeding mother stays in Kuppayama while others go out to earn.tif

"Im taking a monkey, snake and a python to shows and I go all around the country, especially to Colombo, to entertain foreigners"
Prof. Tennyson Perera - Department of Sociology University of Sri Jayawardenepura
They are traditional people who dont legally own land. They are going from place to place looking for food and their migration is from rural to urban. Travelling is an age old habit; even in the colonial era gypsies existed. Their traditional ways of life are sooth saying, snake shows and a little begging. In the villages they do some agriculture. I have seen a group of them in Kesbewa near a tank. Even though the folklore says they cannot stay more than seven days in a place, I noticed them there for three months, living in temporary huts. 
The gypsies are known by many different names around the world. These are just a few. 
Germany - Zigeuner 
France  Gitan, tzigane 
Russia, Bulgaria and Romania - Tishigan 
America  Gypsy, Romani, Roma 
Britain - Gypsies 
Spain - Gitano 
Sweden - Tatara 
Snake shows are characteristic of the gypsies and the snake is a symbol of their community. The connection between snakes and the Ahikuntika peoples is that sometimes it assumes a spirituality and forms of worship. 
Economy
Ahikuntika people have been traditionally known to earn day-to- day existence and had no practice of saving for the future. But their economy has changed as they have now largely adopted to the socio-economic culture of other communities. From what they said, it became evident that they were saving money for their needs by now. 
Young generation
The younger generation of gypsies tend to work their traditional professions in secret or go looking for manual labour jobs in urban areas. Some can be found doing jobs related to tourism in Mount Lavinia, Dehiwala, Galle, Matara and Hikkaduwa areas. They give up education at a very young age in a bid to earn money. Even some of the Sinhalese people in these areas are extremely poor. Even the younger ones are characteristically very patient and this quality has enabled them to be good sportsmen. Gypsy parents keep their children at home while travelling to work, but they go away together for tours in the school holiday season. Most of them dont have voting rights. 
Chandra Sri Ranasinghe - Translator of Lowa Pathira Wasana Ahikuntikayo
Getting the gypsies to settle down has been unsuccessful because they still retain their tribal qualities. In the past they had their annual meeting in Nachchaduwa Wewa, where all of them gathered to solve problems and fix marriages. Now it has become a monthly meeting, as it seems. Their former lifestyle was quite entertaining because in the evening they would gather, enjoy meals together and sing leaving the entire village entertained. It was a time when there were just a few means of entertainment available for villagers. Even though they have been settled down properly, they are still travelling because it is in their genes. Gypsy women go for foreign employment now. 
OIC - Ganemulla Police Station
When we contacted the OIC, his answer was:  Many people are arrested and without checking the documents we cant say anything. 
But according to a reliable source:  Gypsies are arrested due to the complaints against them. Gypsies travel at night and the arrests take place due to suspicion. Anyway the villagers dislike gypsy groups and there are several complaints coming. 
Problems and present
Even though Gypsy people have an endemic culture, they have adapted to the majority community and its culture to a point where little of their own unique culture remains. Now their population is bigger and they find it difficult to travel due to scarcity of barren lands to settle in. This unique community has undergone urbanization and modernization at a rapid pace.

Only solution is to abolish SAITM: IUSF
	
The only solution to resolve the SAITM Malabe Medical Faculty issue was to abolish it and not appointing various Commissions to come up with different solutions, the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) said today.
IUSF Convener Lahiru Weerasekara said it was the responsibility of President Maithripala Sirisena to abolish the private medical university.
The Presidents political alliances and affiliations are not important in this issue. It doesnt matter whether he holds the power or not. As the first citizen, he should intervene and abolish this university without appointing Commissions, he told a news briefing.
He further said that implementing the recommendations made to Parliament by the committees appointed by President Sirisena during his tenure as then Health Minister could have solved the matter rather than hand the matter to another Committee.
The President should inform the public straight away whether he could ban the SAITM medical institute or not. If he is unable, he should say that his executive presidential powers not enough to do so
He said the entire period the President kept silent leaving the countrys matters aside.
However, he said that the university students actions affected on the government, which forced the President to break his long silence and to pay his attention on the matter. He said the IUSF is in a process of discussing the matter with many trade unions, and with the support of them they would knee down the people who are trying to privatize the free education system.

Prem Watsas Fairfax to pay US$ 144 mn for  New Zealand-based insurer
	
Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. will pay US $144 million for New Zealand insurer Tower Ltd., giving it an instant, significant presence in a growing, emerging market.
Towers board of directors has already unanimously approved the sale at about NZ$1.17 per share, or NZ$197 million, a price that reflects a 48 percent premium to Towers closing share price on Feb. 8, according to the deal announcement. In U.S. dollars, thats US$ 0.72 per share, or US$144 million at current exchange rates.
The sale is pending a number of closing conditions, such as approvals from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the New Zealand Overseas Investment Office, Pacific Island regulatory authorities and Tower Shareholders. A shareholder meeting to address the sale proposal will be held in April 2017, and 75 percent of votes cast must sign off on the measure, the deal announcement noted Auckland-based Tower Ltd. is a holding company for Tower Insurance, a major insurer in New Zealand and the Pacific Islands with about 265,000 customers. It offers coverage focused on car, house, contents, business travel and other personal insurance lines.
Prem Watsa, Fairfaxs chairman and CEO, said the acquisition will give it a major foothold in New Zealand and nearby countries.
Tower is one of the largest insurers in New Zealand and the Pacific Islands, with a long-standing history, good brand recognition and a strong market position, Watsa said in prepared remarks. The acquisition  will provide us with an immediate significant presence, with a strong management team.
Watsa added that Tower CEO Richard Harding will continue to lead the company, in a market where Fairfax currently has limited exposure.
Tower Chairman Michael Stiassny said that the insurers board of directors approved Fairfaxs proposal based on part on the substantial premium to Towers share price, plus support from two of Towers major shareholders, Salt Funds Management and ACC, which collectively hold 18.1 percent of Tower shares.
Fairfax is in the middle of a pending offer to buy insurer Allied World Assurance Co. for US$4 .9 billion in cash and stock.
But it has also focused its expansion in different areas of the financial services spectrum. In December, Fairfax won regulatory approval to buy 51 percent of Catholic Syrian Bank Ltd., a major domestic lender in India.

Ranjan submits RTI application
	
Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayaka today submitted an application under the Right to Information (RTI) Act to the Mass Media and Parliamentary Reforms Ministry requesting for information on the 26 TV channels currently operating in the country.
He said there was no system to correct or reply an erroneous news item aired over electronic media when these TV channels make insidious, unethical and unlawful attacks on individuals. He handed over the application to Ministry Secretary H.D.S. Malkanthi.

She told the deputy minister that the ministry would supply the information sought within 14 days. 
The deputy minister told ministry officials that there are 26 TV channels in operation right now while the licenses of certain TV channels like CSN had been suspended. 
The officials told him that there was no system to respond to the electronic media when a person was attacked repeatedly but sufficient safeguards would be incorporated in the new Media Commission Bill to be enacted shortly by the Government. He told the media that he had been proved correct with regard to the Akkaragama episode where he raised his voice against illegal soil mining and even President Maithripala Sirisena had accepted that fact.
I acted on a request by the people in the area to intervene and I revealed that corrupt public officials were conniving with illegal sand miners. That is why they are now keeping mum after asking me to apologize which I refused to do. The SLFP politician who confronted me is also carrying out illegal sand mining with the help of his family members, the deputy minister alleged. 
He told reporters that he would expose the illegal and unethical acts of certain TV channels after he obtained the information from the Mass Media and Parliamentary Reforms Ministry and added that a mechanism was necessary to protect people who come forward to protect the rights of the people from being attacked by the media.

## Title: SAITM A manifestation  of the deep crisis  in education

SAITM A manifestation  of the deep crisis  in education
	
The recent Court of Appeal decision on SAITM has generated a huge debate with pro and anti-SAITM groups flooding traditional and social media with opposing positions and perspectives. University students have also taken to the streets and the boycott of classes by Medical Faculty students has raised the stakes in the debate. Not all opinions expressed on SAITM have necessarily been edifying; yet, the vigorous debate that has emerged is a reflection of how invested our society is on the issue of education. The last time there was such a debate in our society on education, was during the 2011-2012 Federation of University Teachers Association (FUTA) trade union action. 
Yet the focus on SAITM has also had the effect of narrowing the debate on education to a great extent. There is a bigger issue at stake here than simply the future of SAITM or even the future of medical education in our country. What is at stake is the very foundational principles on which our system of education is and should be based. 
It is easy to talk glibly of the great heritage of free education in our country and to periodically genuflect before a portrait or statue of C.W.W. Kannangara. What is more important is to reflect seriously on the underlying principles that shaped free education policy in this country. Even a cursory glance at the debates that took place during that period in the State Council show the depth and breadth with which the issues were discussed. Let us consider just one paragraph of the extensive report issued by the Special Committee on Education, chaired by C.W.W.Kannagara: 


The character of an educational system depends on the character of the society for which it is designed. In a totalitarian system the education system is designed to establish among all sections of the population the opinions of those who for the time being in control of the destinies of the nation. We have assumed that our task was to recommend an educational system suitable for a democracy, and that our main effort must be directed towards deriving a system that would enable every citizen to play his full part in the life of the nation. This appears to us to mean two things. First, it means that the individual must be helped to achieve the highest degree of physical, mental, and moral development of which he is capable irrespective of his wealth or social status. Secondly, it means that the individual as a result of his education should be able to use his abilities for the good of the nation in the fullest possible measure and should be able to pass judgement on affairs of the State and exercise intelligently the franchise that the State has conferred upon him. In other words, democracy requires in the first place a minimum standard of education and, beyond that, equality of educational opportunity. (Chapter II of the Report of the Special Committee on Education 1943). 
Can anyone deny the relevance of these words more than 70 years later Unfortunately, contemporary debates on education are ignoring or taking for granted, the purpose and meaning of education, which as stated so eloquently above should be the basis on which an education system is based. What is of most relevance here, is the idea that education is not simply an individual responsibility  or one which is of value only to the individual who is educated. Rather, education here is described as having a larger, social value: not only does an educated individual have a larger responsibility towards society, it is in the interests of society to ensure that its people are educated  all its people. 

"At tertiary education, the balance of responsibility shifts somewhat although it is now becoming increasingly common for parents to get involved in their childrens higher education as well"

This, I believe, is what should be at the crux of our debates on education today. If we can get this part of it right  the meaning and purpose of education  all else can follow. Unfortunately, discussions on education today, even when presuming to be about the quality or relevance of education are reduced to technical discussions. Should we include life skills education Should all universities have Industry links to promote employability Should teacher training include gender awareness Should people who could afford it be denied the right to choose their education options Should tuition be banned on Sundays and Poya days Should there be a dress code for mothers visiting schools This is what our debates on education are usually reduced to and, this is what education reforms are reduced to. What is not been discussed is the almost imperceptible shift away from education as having a social value to education simply being about individual development. At most, education is linked to a narrowly defined idea of contributing to economic development  thus the current preoccupation with employability, personal skills development and little else. This shift in approach also has an effect on the system of education. Not only does competition and examinations drive the education system, the responsibility for the provision of education as well as ensuring its quality is shifted to the individual.


If you are not getting the best out of education, you are not paying enough for it or you are not working hard enough. Naturally there is then an individual price and cost to education which the individual is expected to bear and it follows that the benefits should also be for the individual. If you are below 18 years, it is the responsibility of the family. Notice how invested parents, especially mothers are in education today Many women have opted out of employment in order to focus on their childrens education. That is because increasingly families are not only paying for education, but they are actually doing most of the educating themselves. You can call it what you want: Charter Schools; School Development Committees; Parent Teacher Associations  but families are expected to bear the burden of education in multiple ways. This then naturally means that the more vulnerable and marginalised sections of society are gradually left out of education. 
At tertiary education, the balance of responsibility shifts somewhat although it is now becoming increasingly common for parents to get involved in their childrens higher education as well. In fact, this has become so accepted that parents are often called upon to vouch or function as hostage for their childrens good behaviour in universities. In my own university, I have seen an increasing trend where parents not only accompany their adult children to universities to discuss subject and career choices, but also do most of the talking during these sessions. In terms of cost, the idea of raising loans for education has become far more acceptable. The assumption being that upon completing education and obtaining employment, the loans will be repaid. Once again, individual responsibility is stressed. Being politically active, engaging in extra-curricular activities, learning at your own pace, not having a definite career path are increasingly not tolerated in higher education. 
What this also means is that society does not feel as if it has a stake in the education system. Some of the posts in social media show the extent to which this attitude has become normalised. For instance, SAITM students and others going to private institutions are considered to be responsible because they pay for their own education compared to students at state universities who are wasting tax payers money.


"Unless we realise our collective responsibility for education and recognise its social value, our interventions in the field of education will remain superficial at best"

The idea being that unless you pay for it yourself, you will not value education. But this also means that your responsibility is then towards yourself  and not anyone else. The social value of education and the need for society to invest in an educated population is rarely considered. Yet, as a society we complain about the increasing selfishness and self-centredness of youth; we talk about the lack of democratic and civic values among our citizens; we criticise the quality of our leaders and politicians; we bemoan the inefficiency of our bureaucrats, the lack of creativity in our artists, the lack of empathy and sensitivity among our doctors, the narrow vision of our engineers and the corruption amongst our financiers. When we make the connections among these problems and the education system, we focus our reforms on curricula revision and teacher training. So now curriculums must include soft skills, civic and human rights education and teachers must be child centred rather than teacher-centred. Schools must become child-friendly. What we fail to see is that when the education system loses its social value, its social relevance and its sense of social responsibility, we can hardly expect the products that emerge from such a system to think beyond their individual aspirations and desires. You cant teach civic and human rights and expect much within a system that rewards individual success even at the cost of others. 


It is in this context that the issue of commercialisation and commodification of education highlighted in the SAITM debate needs to be considered. There are certain services, such as health and education at the very least, that need to be above commercial and private considerations. These services are essential for the very functioning of society. They have to be guaranteed and provided equally to all people. And that has to be the responsibility of the government not of individual private enterprise. After all, what is a government for 
This does not mean that we do not take into account the massive socio-economic changes that have taken place since 1943. The demand for education has grown (hence the interest of the private sector in investing in education  health and education are becoming two of the most lucrative areas in the economy). The unregulated and unplanned growth of international schools is producing school leavers desiring higher education with no chance of entry into the state university system and who cannot afford or do not necessarily want to go out of the country for higher education. How do we cater to this segment of the population The population with A/L qualifications desiring higher education has increased considerably. Yet, at the same time, certain faculties and disciplines in the state universities are struggling to survive due to lack of students. There is certainly something wrong with the university selection process as well as admission to universities. 


"What we fail to see is that when the education system loses its social value, its social relevance and its sense of social responsibility, we can hardly expect the products that emerge from such a system to think beyond their individual aspirations and desires"

But, the fundamental question still remains: what is the purpose and meaning of education Unless we realise our collective responsibility for education and recognise its social value (and not simply its individual worth), our interventions in the field of education will remain superficial at best. In the absence of such a debate and leadership in education, crises such as the one before us today in the form of SAITM will only deepen. Let me repeat: The character of an educational system depends on the character of the society for which it is designed. The crisis in education is a reflection of the crisis in the character of our society today.

SLFP yet to decide on referendum: Dilan Perera
	
Days after the United National Party (UNP) spoke of a referendum on the proposed new Constitution, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) said it had not yet decided to go in for a constitution requiring the approval of people at a referendum.
SLFP spokesperson, State Minister Dilan Perera told Daily Mirror that there was no decision by the SLFP at the moment to support any constitutional amendment that would need a referendum.
At the movement the SLFP has appointed a committee to look into these matters. It is still continuing its work, he said.
He was responding to Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella who said that the UNP, with the consent of the SLFP, intended to go for a referendum.
It is a good dream to have because we can all reach a conclusion and go forward. For that dream to come true, it is high time that Mr. Kiriella behaves like a person in the joint government. He has kept on saying that this is a UNP government and the SLFP must fall in line. He must understand that that will never happen. Mr. Kiriella is a former SLFPer. We, the SLFPers, are very stubborn people when it comes to principles. We do not fall in line with the UNP principles. If the UNP is willing to meet us halfway, we will reciprocate, Mr. Perera said.
Mr. Perera said once the SLFP submitted its report, it would decide whether to move for far reaching reforms needing a referendum or to adopt amendments that do not require one in its initial stages. (Kelum Bandara)

In a response to a Court order, Prisons Department earlier had filled a medical report on the suspect and informed court the inability of producing him in Court for the ongoing three bribery cases filed over the charges of not declaring his assets and liabilities for three years.
The Bribery Commission had filed three separate cases against Mr. Silva under the Assets and Liabilities Act for not declaring his assets in 2010, 2011 and 2013.
The Bribery Commission had named Parliament Deputy Secretary General P.M. Neil Parakrama and several others as witnesses.
Senior Counsel Anuja Premaratne appeared for the defence.
The Colombo High Court sentenced him to death after being convicted of the murder Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Tax on soft liquor raises hard liquor use: PHU
	
The Governments move to impose heavy taxes on soft liquor with a lower alcohol content had increased the consumption of hard liquor among Sri Lankans during the past two years, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) said today.
PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila said it was the normal practice worldwide to impose taxes on hard liquor instead of doing so on soft liquor.
However, we are against the consumption of both categories. If the government is unable to ban alcohol, it should have at least promoted those with a lesser alcohol content. Those who consumed beer in the past are consuming hard liquor today because a person can purchase two 250ml bottles of arrack for the price of a can of beer, he told a news conference.
The MP said 74 million litres of arrack were sold in 2014 and it had increased to 94 million litres in 2016.
This is an increase of 28 per cent. Similarly, one of the leading distilleries had recorded an income of Rs.9.7 million which is an increase of 300 per cent of the companys revenue in 2014, he said.
The MP said the distillery which had recorded an enormous income was promoting the sale of 250 ml bottles of arrack targeting the youth.
He requested President Maithripala Sirisena to increase taxes on hard liquor including arrack and to implement the Mathata Thitha (End to alcohol) programme effectively. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
