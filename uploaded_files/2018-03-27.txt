A bull in a china shop
	
?
There is a head of an establishment in the industries and commerce sector who has made it a practice to dash on floor the files submitted to him by some executives to show them his displeasure, they say.
?
A typical political appointee, this white-collar high-up would dash the files on the floor and bark at executives whenever they make an endorsement on files stating their objections to illegal instructions given by him.
Two female accountants who have got disgusted with the uncouth behavior of the high- up have already applied for transfers, they say.?
This establishment head would create this ugly scene in his office at once or twice a week, but the political authority responsible for his appointment despite being well aware of the situation, is turning a blind eye to it, employees say.

Bangladesh showcases  its best for  Colombo?s film buffs
	
From March 23 to 25, art film lovers of Colombo were treated to a fine collection of Bangladeshi films by the Bangladesh High Commission here and the?
Sri Lankan National Film Corporation.?
What was remarkable about the ensemble of films was the variation in the theme. The entire gamut of issues facing Bangladesh was covered like never before. It spanned the historical and the contemporary; the traumatic past associated with the 1971 liberation struggle and the challenges of present-day Bangladesh; the distinctiveness of issues confronting urban and rural Bangladesh; the ideological clash between anachronistic Islamic fundamentalists and present-day youth exposed to modern means of communication. Last but not the least, the issue of gender was presented forcefully.?
The films shown also clearly brought out how, despite the rising tide of Islamic fundamentalism, Bangladesh is a culturally integrated country and is unabashedly so. Here?s a country where the Hindus and the Muslims work together, united by a passion for the soil of Bengal, the Bengali language and Bengali culture which embraces both Muslims and Hindus. The casting was multi-religious, and borders were transcended in the process. The credit titles featured even South Indian names like Krishnamoorthy and Pillai! The star cast included Irfan Khan and Rahul Roy of India. Bangladeshi cinema is a true integrator.?
The resultant blend is both unique and captivating. It gives multi-cultural and multi-religious countries, currently under assault by fanatic majoritarian forces, reasons to hope that they will survive.?
The opening film was Mostafa Sarwar Farooki?s ?Doob? (No Bed of Roses), starring famous Indian actor Irfan Khan. It was about famous film director Javed Hassan who, due to his over commitment to his work, gets distanced from his wife and children. He complicates matters by falling for an attractive starlet. But Javed is unable to communicate his dilemmas to his school teacher wife.?
The theme is not unusual but Director Farooki brought out the inner tension without resorting to melodrama. He told the tale of human vanity and egotism and the paradoxes that crop up in our lives realistically but with sensitivity.?
?
?
Aynabaji
Amitabh Reza?s directorial debut ?Aynabaji? has an unusual theme. Protagonist Sharafat Karim Ayna is a ?human chameleon? serving as a ?double? for socially highly placed but convicted criminals. The dark underbelly of Dhaka?s criminal and judiciary system is portrayed starkly. The double?s mystery is chased by inquisitive and stubborn crime reporter Saber.?
But like every cocky-confident ?professional,? Ayna gets into deep trouble and eventually finds himself not having any control over the proceedings. He becomes a prisoner who, to his dismay, is finally sentenced to death. But ingenuity and daring help him escape from prison to cycle away as a ?prison guard? going home after duty.?
The thriller has ample twists and surprises, with Chanchal Chowdhury turning in an unforgettable performance as Ayna. Partha Barua is every inch a committed reporter struggling to dig the truth but only to be cold shouldered by the editor.?
?
?
Television
In this film on Islamic fundamentalism in rural Bangladesh, a patriarchal and dictatorial village chairman, Amin, bans every kind of image in his village, including cinema, television sets, cameras and mobile phones. He even declares that ?imagination? is sinful as it leads one into prohibited territory.?
Amin?s orders are met with obedience first, and then by subtle defiance, and eventually by open revolt. Muslim villagers were secretly watching TV in the Hindu school teacher?s house and a mirror was used to reflect TV images to help beat the religious taboo. But those caught doing this were punished.?
Eventually, defiance became confrontational with agitators intimidating the aged chairman publicly. Surprisingly, the seeds of revolt were planted by his imbecile son, having been influenced by his progressive and daring lady love.?
But the hold of tradition being what it is, the son apologizes to the father. But the father continues to shun images as ?haram? and struggled hard to accept being photographed for a passport to go to Mecca. But a chance glance at a television set showing a direct telecast from Mecca made him change his mind about TV. What was haram, became halal.?
?
Under Construction
The age-old problem of patriarchy and class divisions in urban Bangladesh is examined in Rubaiyat Hossain?s ?Under Construction.? On the surface, protagonist Roya seems to have a perfectly built life, with a long-standing acting career, a businessman husband and a sleek apartment with a full-time maid, Moyna.?
But Roya?s life is dictated to by the husband who has no empathy for her or her achievements and struggles in her artistic career. At work, it is the director who dictates to her. She finally throws off the yolk of the husband as well as that of the director and takes charge of her life, partly inspired by her plucky housemaid.?
Director Rubaiyat Hossain is no stranger to controversy. Her debut film ?Meherjaan? about a love affair between a Bangladeshi woman and a Pakistani soldier during the 1971 war of independence was pulled out of cinemas after a week due to a public outcry. ?Under Construction? is in line with Rubaiyat?s passion for challenging stereotypes and dragging people out of their cocoons.?
?
?
BhubanMajhi
?BhubanMajhi? by Fakhrul Arefeen Khan is set against the backdrop of the 1971 Bangladesh war of liberation from Pakistan. Being a documentary filmmaker gives Arefeen an edge in portraying historic events. But he tells the story not in a drab way, but with the sensitivity of a creative artiste.?
However, the long time-frame of the film, spanning the years between 1971 and 2013 with all their complexity, posed a challenge to the director. Whether he met the challenge is for the audience to judge, but critics said the film was a must watch.?
?
?
?
?
?
Anil BagchirEkdin
?Anil BagchirEkdin? is also set against the backdrop of the liberation struggle of 1971. It revolves round a Hindu family which is partly located in Dhaka and partly in its native village. When the Pakistani army began its crackdown on Bangladeshis, especially the Hindus among them, Anil is told that his father had been killed by the Pakistani army. He rushes to his village against advice. In the bus he is told by a Muslim co-passenger not to reveal his Hindu name but to go as ?Mohsin.? But being a timid man, Anil gives away his real name when confronted by a Pakistan military search party.?
He is taken to be tortured and killed. But while being taken away he told his Muslim fellow-traveller to tell his sister, Atoshi, who is in love with a Muslim, to marry the lover, disregarding Hindu social taboos.?

Barrage of missiles on S. Arabia ramps up Yemen war

REUTERS, 26th MARCH, 2018
The Houthi movement that controls northern Yemen vowed on Monday to fire more missiles into Saudi Arabia unless it stops bombing the country, after missiles crashed into Riyadh overnight causing casualties in the Saudi capital for the first time.
The incident threatens to sharply escalate a war that has already unleashed what the United Nations considers the world?s most urgent humanitarian crisis. Millions of people live under threat of mass starvation and disease, at the mercy of combatants who have shut food and medical supplies in the past.
Saudi forces said they shot down three missiles over Riyadh shortly before midnight. Debris fell on a home in the capital, killing an Egyptian resident and wounding two other Egyptians.
Air defenses also repelled missiles fired at the southern Saudi cities of Najran, Jizan and Khamis Mushait, Saudi-led coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said.
A top Houthi leader hailed the attack, which took place on the eve of the third anniversary of the entry into the Yemen war by Saudi Arabia and its?
Arab allies.

Don Bosco Vocational Training Centre Making way for change through education
	
A trip to the North through a path dotted with a palmyrah trees and parched terrains reminds us of a bygone era. Its unique cultural identity highlighted through colours, cuisine and chimes emerging from kovils is slowly returning to its former glory. Among the many opportunities the people in the North have lost, education takes centre-stage. Although the North was known for producing many intellects to this country, years of bloodshed have resulted in a major brain drain. Today we see and hear of students struggling to remember simple theories in maths, science and other subjects as a result of the trauma they have experienced. Among a school system separating girls from boys, many vocational training centres have found potential in the Northern terrains. These training centres are usually frequented by students of both genders, who aspire to find jobs at a nearby garment factory or a welding shop.? ?
During a recent visit to Kilinochchi, the Daily Mirror visited the Don Bosco Vocational Training Centre (DBVTC) in Pallawarayankattu and spoke to its students and teachers. Although many of them were shy to speak at first, they didn?t hesitate to tell us who they want to be in future and how their ?College? has helped them in their life?s journey.? ?
A ray of hope? ?
DBVTC commenced operations back in 2005 and has provided vocational training to many under-privileged children in the area. While the majority of them come from war-torn areas, they are deprived of an economic and social status. ?Almost all students get jobs. There are garment factories in Mannar, Vavuniya, Kilinochchi, Jaffna and other places,? said Fr. Vincent Sebastian, Director of the Centre. Fr. Vincent is of Indian origin and resumed work in June 2016, dedicating his time and efforts for the future of the students at this Centre. Having worked as a professor in three universities, a parish priest and a secretary in a mixed-school in India, Fr. Vincent is aware of how important it is for one to be educated. ?I saw pictures and news of the war and how people were affected by it in Sri Lanka. Then I wanted to come and help the children to continue their education,?he said.?
Courses at DBVTC include tailoring, computing, baking, welding and carpentry among others. Other facilities include a hostel, youth centre, farming and animal husbandry, counselling services, English Academy, rehabilitation of ex-combatants among others. Students have to follow a six-month course and at the end they receive a National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) certificate. According to Fr. Vincent although the German Government has been funding to upgrade its facilities, since March 2017 the Centre functions with its own funds. ?What we collect from the students is used to pay teachers. It?s about Rs. 25,000 with EPF and ETF. In order to raise funds we have installed a solar panel system which contributes to the National Grid; it is one of the main sources of income. Some of the students pay Rs. 500 or Rs. 600 because we can?t expect everybody to pay Rs. 1000,? he added.
Mental trauma and dropout rates
Although around 90 students initially registered for the course many of them seem to dropout during the course. According to the teachings of psychology, a disturbed childhood would affect the overall well-being of a child. There are vital stages in the development cycle which requires proper nurturing and care. A traumatic childhood disrupts this cycle to the point that children would no longer retain what they learn and will lose their fear to do certain activities. Statistics show that those with a traumatic childhood often get involved in substance abuse and even become criminals at a later stage.? ?
?Absenteeism is very common here,? said Fr. Vincent expressing his concerns about the future of these students. ?They are shy to express their ideas even in the class. We can?t force them because they have already gone through a forceful childhood. We can?t inculcate discipline in this system. The moment we become strict, students stop attending the course. As a result there are only around 62 students remaining from the initially enrolled number. Their self-confidence needs to developed and this takes time. They want to be free and sometimes they don?t remember certain things we have taught them. This could be seen during the spoken English sessions I do,? Fr. Vincent further said.? ?
Thoughts of students and teachers
?We spoke to a few students and they shared their thoughts with us :? ?
?The certificate we get from here is very useful for our future careers.? said R. Nirojini? ?
?I would like to start my own tailoring shop because I have learned it in college,? said Diluxshy? ?
?I like to go ahead in IT and through this course I have learned Microsoft Excel, Windows operations and other IT related subjects? said Thanojan? ?
?Through the spoken English lessons we have learned correct pronunciations. We have learned many words and grammar. It?s quite interesting.? said Naseem? ?
?We learned about tenses and various other grammatical terms in English. It?s new, but interesting as well.? said? Lakshi? ?
Two teachers also shared their experiences with us had this to say.??
?They don?t show an interest to continue with these subjects?- Komathy? ?
K. Komathy joined the Don Bosco Technical College in October 2010 and teaches ICT to the students. ?I have taught ICT in a non-formal educational setup in a school in Pallimunai, Mannar. Most of these students have had a traumatic childhood. They come from war-torn areas and have economically experienced hardships. Therefore they don?t show an interest to continue with these subjects. As a result there?s a high dropout rate. They don?t get enough jobs in computer-related fields and the only solution is to go to the South or abroad. We have a computer lab and students get both practical and theory lessons,?said Komathy.??
?Girls show an interest in tailoring?- Sashiraji? ?
?Students learn with a lot of interest,? said R. Sashiraji who joined the institute in 2011 and now teaches tailoring. ?I have been a teacher for 16 years. We were trained by the German Government before we started working here. Students at Don Bosco have to participate in a six-month course. Unlike in other subjects girls show an interest in it. This may be because there are many garment factories in the area and they are sure of getting a job there. We want to teach the children and check their progress,?said Sashiraji.?
?
What?s in store for the future?
The DBVTC has provided many opportunities to children in the area and those from afar. The Don Bosco Trust has a number of establishments around the country and will be starting many more schools in English medium up to the A/L standard. ?I too joined after seeing an advertisement in the papers. Except for tailoring and welding these areas don?t create any other jobs. We have invested in a lot of equipment for carpentry, but there are no students. Before the war there were many students interested in carpentry, but it?s not so now.?said one of the officials.?
Upon observing their performances Fr. Vincent said that they are picking up English slowly. ?But they have the interest. Most of these children speak colloquial Tamil when compared to those in the rest of the country. Now they want to learn English and Sinhala as well. Through education we could remove many barriers. Through communication we could speak to them and listen to their problems. I always tell the students that Sri Lanka is one country. They always think it is divided and feel they are like refugees. They feel that they are being discriminated against, that their rights have been deprived of and because of the military presence they also feel threatened,? said a concerned Fr. Vincent.? ?
With his experience in India, Fr. Vincent believes that the authorities must introduce values to the education system. ?Without values the entire education system will be disrupted. Here, they can also introduce more extra-curricular activities, team work, field visits, practical activities and group work.? he said.?
In his concluding remarks, Fr. Vincent said that he likes to remain in Sri Lanka and promote education among children. ?Now the negative effects of the war are slowly vanishing. The education system will create change and upgrade the standard of life. I want people to forget the past and integrate into the society. After all they have a duty towards establishing unity in the country,?said Fr.Vincent.?

EAP seals deal to sell key assets to Singapore firm
	
A?deal has been sealed to sell some of the key EAP Group assets to a Singapore-based investment holding company, with Sri Lanka?s Central Bank giving the green light to proceed with the deal, Mirror Business learns.
The assets that will be sold under the US $ 75 million deal would be Swarnamahal Financial Services PLC, EAP Films and Theatres Private Limited, EAP Broadcasting Company Limited and Swarnamahal Jewellers.
The sources familiar with the deal however said only 45 percent of EAP Broadcasting Company, which houses a TV station and several radio stations, would be sold, as the regulations only allow foreigners to hold up to 45 percent ownership in media companies.
They further said EAP Group is likely to receive an advance payment running into several million US dollars today and the deal may be completed by end-April. The deal will be carried out in two tranches and the first tranche would amount to US $ 43 million.
All attempts to obtain a comment from the Central Bank over the developments proved unsuccessful. An email query sent to Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy yesterday went unanswered.
Despite various speculations and rumours about the source of the funds, the Singaporean monetary authority is said to have cleared the investments.
Earlier newspaper reports suggested that the real investors behind the deal were the UK-based Lyca Group, owned by Sri Lankan-born entrepreneur Allirajah Subaskaran.
The Central Bank in January placed troubled ETI Finance and Swarnamahal Financial Services PLC of ETI Group under a three-member expert panel to bring the two illiquid, mismanaged, non-banking financial institutions into liquidity within six months, mainly through the sale of assets within ETI Group.
The panel consists of former Central Bank Assistant Governor Sepala Ratnayake, former Bank of Ceylon Senior Deputy General Manager P.A. Lionel and former Bank of Ceylon Assistant General Manager H.M. Thilakarathne.
According to the Central Bank, ETI Finance, which has an asset base of Rs.33 billion, has 33,000 depositors with Rs.33.5 billion in deposits, while Swarnamahal Financial Services PLC, with an asset base of Rs.2.5 billion, has 2,300 depositors, with Rs.2.4 billion in deposits.

?Fight Cancer Walk? on Sunday A father realises his son?s dream
	
?
After discovering that his beloved teenage son Humaid was suffering from Osteosarcoma, M.S.H. Mohamed?s life changed forever. Little did he know that a mere shoulder pain his son was complaining of would have such detrimental effects on their lives. Humaid was suffering from an aggressive form of a cancerous tumour in the bones, they learned. And thus began a father?s dauntless journey to battle this monstrous illness.?
Mohamed stopped at nothing to seek treatment for Humaid.
He was to soon realise the gravity of the illness named cancer. Mohamed was one among hundreds who felt helpless. Cancer was not only life threatening, but also costly to treat. Like hundreds before them, this father and son were soon compelled to seek treatment at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Maharagama, also known as Apeksha Hospital.?
It was Humaid?s wish to help patients like him. It was Mohamed?s wish to see his son?s benevolent desire fulfilled. They chose to invest their time and effort on securing an urgent, but expensive requirement for the hospital, a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanner.
In terms of Cancer, timely and accurate identification of the disease is a determinant of the patient?s lifespan as well as the quality of life. Oncologists worldwide therefore rely on the sound accuracy of a PET scan to map out treatment. In Sri Lanka, those who were able to afford a PET scan from private hospitals generally had to fork out a whopping Rs. 150,000 per scan. Patients who were unable to afford this amount are therefore forced to rely on Computed Tomography (CT) scans or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).?
?
Numerous donors?
The hospital?s need was communicated and funds were raised by the absolute will and determination of Mohamed and the Fight Cancer Team (FCT) he successfully formed. Numerous donors, from all walks of life responded immediately. Within a matter of months, a sum of an estimated 230 million rupees was raised by the fund.
The battle was far from won however. As Humaid?s health deteriorated, the purchase of the scanner was delayed by red tape. Humaid, after a battle too arduous for his young age, passed away on September 12, 2017 with the faith that his father and the FCT would one day make his dream come true. Today, the long wait is finally over. The PET scanner reached Sri Lanka in January while preparations were carried out to install the machine at the NCI.?
Personnel from the tri-forces and Police, celebrities, cricketers and philanthropists are expected to come together on April 1 in solidarity with the efforts of FCT. Chairman of the FCT walk committee Dr. Zurfick said the objective of the walk was to honour and help those battling cancer. ?The Director of Apeksha Hospital, Dr. M.Y. K. Wilfred and Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe have been pillars of strength in carrying out our fundraising activities. There were many who helped us in numerous ways and we expect to see their efforts translated to numbers on Sunday (April 1),? he said adding that over 3,000 participants were expected to join the FCT walk.
FCT leader Mohamed said the walk would take place to honour the contributions of noble Sri Lankans who made the purchase of the PET scanner possible. ?Our efforts are to battle the disease that would be the number one cause of death in Sri Lanka by 2022. We hope to raise awareness on cancer as it is our responsibility to educate the nation. FCT wishes to make the NCI in Maharagama the best hospital to receive treatment for cancer in South Asia by 2020 and we hope all Sri Lankans regardless of ethnic and religious differences will join us in our noble cause,? he said.

It was Humaid?s wish to help patients like him.?It was Mohamed?s wish to see his son?s benevolent desire fulfilled.?

The PET scanner inauguration ceremony and walk will take place on April 1.?
The walk will commence at 7.00 am from 569, Galle Road, Wellawatte (Opposite Roxy Cinema) and will proceed along Hospital road towards Apeksha Hospital, Maharagama.?
The PET scanner will then be handed over to hospital authorities at?10. 00 a.m.??

These are tragic tales of the lives of some innocent parents who were compelled to grin and bear tragedies. These tragedies happened when their kids? breathed their?last recently.? ?
For many years, it has been reported that the dengue mosquitoes were active and were sucking the blood of the people from all walks of life. But it is ironic that such tragedies befall on innocent kids. The loss of such kids is felt by their parents forever. It is not only the dengue mosquito, but also the lives of the infants that have been snuffed out in various devilish forms from time to time.? ?
Among those who died recently was a son by the name Shalika Shehan. This child is said to have lived with much hope. Having lived in Kalutara area, he was first educated at Kalutara Maha Vidyalaya and later enrolled at Royal College, Colombo. He showed a keen interest in education and extra-curricular activities. He had just sat for the Advanced Level Examination when this tragedy took place. When the son worshiped his father, who was about to leave home, he might not have thought that it was the last time he would get to worship his dad. Shehan, who died of a sudden heart attack, was also denied of the opportunity to know that he had obtained many distinctions at A/Level Examination. The house where he lived is isolated today.? ?

Another death? ?
Another ?flower bud? named Dewindi, who lived under the parents care, had a similar tragedy. She studied in grade 5 in Thri/Padavipura Jayanthi Wewa School. The cartoon ?hero? in a TV.

This resulted in the unfortunate death of tiny Dewindi. This is how she said goodbye to life at an unexpected moment.? ?

He was a resident of Samindugama (an area spanning 40 acres), in Chilaw. He had gone to the jungle with the hope of catching parrots with an unknown person. This person has had the habit of visiting the village to pluck king coconuts. But, he was unable to fulfill his expectations of catching parrots which was child?s hobby. It is said that this boy had been sexually abused, the incident leading to his death. It was after several days that the boy?s remains were found. The remains of the boy were found in a jungle in Inuwila.? ?
Even before the flames of Susith?s funeral pyre died down the death of another child, this time a daughter, was recorded. The name of the deceased was Saheli Niwarthika. She was a grade four student and attended Buddhist Primary school in Dehiowita. She was very humble and obedient to her teachers. The children in her class had to walk on the coconut shells as part of an extra-curricular activity, prescribed in the syllabus. The children in this class were seen practicing this activity earnestly on the gravel-less ground. Therefore, it was a frequent sight for the teachers to see these kids practice.? ?
All of a sudden, small Saheli had collapsed on the ground while trying this exercise. In spite of the fact that Saheli was hospitalized by the teachers concerned, she died unexpectedly.? ?The daughter, Madubhashini Buddhika Liyanage (16) was another student who faced an untimely tragedy as all others mentioned here. She studied in grade eleven in Udagama Maha Vidyalaya in Atabage in Gampola. She was a resident of Deniyagama area in Millagahamula in Gampola. She was well versed in music.? ?She played the violin well and was a gifted singer. She also attended dancing classes with her classmates. She had dropped her head saying that she was having a severe headache. Despite being taken to the nearby rural hospital for treatment, her condition had worsened. She was admitted to the Gampola Hospital for further treatment as per the medical instructions, but her life could not be saved.? ?
However, it is clear that these deaths have left a clear message?for us.
?
?Malnutrition also causes?untime deaths?
According to Nutritionist, Harshani Meegaswatte, obesity has become an issue, especially among urban children. But, there are also children who suffer from malnutrition despite food being available at homes. Although some mothers give food to their children these diets aren?t balanced. Most children as a result don?t carry the proper weight for their age. The weight of some children are below average. Some children don?t have breakfast. Such children have their first meal during the interval.? ?
She added that it was not only child abuse, but malnutrition that has brought untimely deaths to children. These factors are the causes for their malnutrition, she emphasized.?

Four SLFPers signing no-faith motion REFLECTS party?s mood  - Anura Yapa
	
? ?
?
Disaster Management Minister Anura PriyadarshanaYapa, who is a senior member of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), speaks about political developments in the wake of a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.?
The Excerpts:???Q? As a senior Minister representing Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), what is your view on the no?confidence motion?
This is not against him personally, according to my understanding. After the results of the local polls were announced, the people have voiced their disappointment with the government, its policies and performance. I think people wanted a change of policies and direction. They asked for economic revival. My thinking is that this is an attempt by the opposition to voice the concerns of people. They think the direction is not good. The best option is to try a no confidence motion against the Prime Minister. That is my?political understanding.??
We will have to understand that there are lots of reasons for it. People always have expectations. They have lost hope now. Who is to take the responsibility? That is the question to be raised next.? ?
?
?Q The SLFP is part and parcel of this government; in fact, the Head of State is from the SLFP and your party held key ministerial portfolios. Don?t you think that the SLFP is also responsible for the current economic mess which you referred to?
We are partly responsible, I agree to that. But, we are not solely responsible. The important Ministries, such as the ones dealing with economic affairs and investment, were vested with the United National Party (UNP). I am not going to put the blame on them entirely. As a whole, they are more responsible than us. They hold those key ministries - Finance, Investment Promotion, Economic Development etc. That is the reason.??
?
?Q From your perspective, what are the wrongful decisions taken as far as the economy is concerned?
There was a system ongoing regarding the economic development during the term of the last regime. There were criticisms against them regarding the nature of economic development being implemented. This government came and stopped the development momentum. They could not restart. The rhythm of development was gone. They could have allowed the development process to go on and found the areas to be corrected. Instead of doing it, they stopped all development works on the assumption that everything was corrupt. It cannot be like that. On the other hand, they have taken some decisions not healthy for a developing economy like ours.? ?
?Q What do you mean by that?
They immediately brought down fuel prices by a sizeable margin. Also, they increased the salaries of public servants by Rs.10,000. They could have done it in a phased out manner. It dented the economy. Thirdly, we should have been involved in getting small and medium scale investment to the country. It did not happen because there were huge delays in decision making. In fact, decision making was very poor. The other thing is public service. Most of the senior public servants were treated shabbily by the government.?
They were hauled before special investigative units. It completely eroded the confidence of public servants. Decision making in the country is very slow as a result. No-one is prepared to take decisions in fear of repercussions. It all contributed to the downfall of economy. That is my view. It is one thing to find a person or persons involved in wrongdoing. It is another thing to consider all of them as a thieving lot. You cannot run a government like this. You have to take decisions, be it right or wrong. Decisions may sometimes go wrong. Where is the cover for them? Who is there to look after them if their decisions go wrong? I am referring to bona fide decisions, not mala fide decisions. There is no protection for them in such a situation. That is what happened under this government.? ?
?
?Q What is the SLFP?s decision on the no confidence motion?
The SLFP will decide unanimously. It will be a collective decision. We will not take individual decisions.? ?
?
?Q Have you discussed this matter?
There were a lot of discussions. There are some ideas which were exchanged. Beyond that, if we are to support the motion, we will do it as a party, not?as individuals.? ?
?
?Q What is the general mood of the party?
As you have seen, the SLFP members who signed the no confidence motion reflect the mood of the party.? ?
?
?Q But, no SLFP Minister has placed the signature. Why?is it?
I do not think the Ministers can do it. If the Ministers were to resign, they should have resigned and signed.? ?
?
?Q The President is from the SLFP. If the SLFP wants to remove the Prime Minister, the President can act in this regard rather than bringing a no confidence motion. Why didn?t that happen?
Don?t involve the President here! He is the leader of the party. We are a democratic party.?
?
?Q In Sri Lanka, as far as the party politics are concerned, the decisions by the leaders prevail in most cases. Why is there any difference this time?
?It is not the case on this matter. This is a special occasion. The SLFP takes decisions after discussing among its members when it comes to issues of parliamentarians. When it comes to other issues, we discussed it with the Central Committee. We will take the?appropriate decision.??
?
?Q What will be the next step if the no confidence motion succeeds?
Then, it is up to the President to take decisions. As the Head of State, he has to decide what could be the next move.? ?
?
?Q You have any personal suggestion for premiership?
I have no suggestion regarding?any person.? ?
?
?Q As a senior SLFP Minister, how do you see your experience in governing together with the UNP?
There is very slow progress actually. As a SLFP Minister, I would like to see the country progressing economically and socially. Those two things are very important. I have been a Minister in three governments. Economic development is the key area where we have to put our fullest possible effort. After the war, everyone wanted to see a development in the country. We have a young, robust population. They are very educated. Along with economic development, there should be fair play. It is a vital aspect. It has been a political debate for a long time. It is equally important to control corruption. These are the aspirations of young people. I cannot think of any country being able to eradicate?
corruption totally.?
?Yet, there has to be methodology to curb corruption by taking appropriate measures. I am not merely talking about remanding those indulging in corruption and bringing them before law. I do not say it will serve the purpose. It has its own merits for sure. There must be futuristic, transparent systems. They are adopted in other countries. Young people are urging for that. I do not see that it has taken place in?the country.? ?
?
?Q What is the future of SLFP under the current circumstances?
The future of the SLFP is very good. My humble wish is that these two factions should be united.?
?
??Q One faction is now in the opposition. There is one faction in the government. You also belong to it. The faction in the opposition now functions under the Lotus Bud symbol. Do you want the two factions to be under that symbol or under the symbol of the SLFP?
That depends on how the political situation develops in the country. I cannot say we are joining hands with them or they are joining us. It is a rational question. You have to wait for the last moment to see the answer. I am visualizing a situation where the SLFP is getting united.? ?
The SLFP is a party with a large vote base. It is the largest political party in the country. It has produced very good leaders. Our leadership ladder is very broad even today. We have a great ladder. It is a party no one can destroy. We have temporary issues. It is something different. I think these temporary issues can be resolved very soon. We will get united. We will decide what to do.? ?
?
?Q How do you look to the next Presidential Election?
It is too early to comment. We have to wait for these developments to take place.? ?
?Q Are you positively adopting the election?
Yes.??
?
?Q When it comes to the subjects of your ministry, what are your plans for disaster mitigation?
It is a key area where we have to take action. It is not an easy thing, though. It is because of unpredictability of rain pattern. Last year, we had rain and floods in one area and drought in another area. We have to educate people. Land use pattern is very important. Preserving water is quite essential. Looking after tanks and rehabilitating them are urgently needed.? ?
?
?Q Actually, you promised to enact certain legislations to deal with disaster management. How is the progress now?
I have done that. They are pending with the Legal Draftsman?s Department.? ?
?
?Q You promised legislation to prevent constructions in river basin areas. What is the progress?
That is the prerogative of other Ministers. We only put the Cabinet papers. We need to keep special corridors, bunts in such areas. Also, we need to prevent excessive sand mining in rivers. Our forest areas have to be protected.? ?

## Title: GMOA concerned over lifting of Glyphosate ban

GMOA concerned over lifting of Glyphosate ban
	
The Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) made a statement to the media yesterday expressing concern over Minister of Agriculture Duminda Dissanayake?s recommendations to cabinet that the ban on agrochemical Glyphosate be lifted.
Secretary of the GMOA Dr Haritha Aluthge said attempts by current cabinet members to remove the ban were ?purely political? and called on President Maithripala to have a proactive dialogue with the association, as well as environmentalists and economists, without making an impetuous decision about the ban.
Dr Aluthge said the Government had a responsibility to uphold its election promise to ban Glyphosate and consideration ought to be taken of the potential environmental, health and economic damage caused by the herbicide.
Whether the ban should remain has been a controversial Parliamentary topic in recent weeks, with UNP?s Rural Economic Affairs Minister P. Harrison recently blaming the ban for the party's? failure in the last Local Government Elections. Harrison said the elections were an indication that the Government was "compelled to provide the poisonous synthetic fertiliser".
The Government issued a Gazette notification banning the popular herbicide on June 10 last year, which had the immediate effect of preventing its import and release. The ban was made under a directive of Minister Duminda Dissanayake.
The sudden decision? was widely criticised by various stakeholders, including the Planters? Association of Ceylon, which complained that no viable alternative was given by the Government, causing the tea industry to lose over $100 million in the first 18 months following the introduction of the ban.
The agricultural use of Glyphosate is contentious, with academics and researchers divided on whether the chemical had a direct link to the high prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease of an uncertain aietology (CKDu) in Sri Lanka.
CKDu has killed over 20,000 people predominantly from agricultural regions in the last two decades and its direct cause is still unknown.
The GMOA maintains that that Glyphosate is a causative factor in CKDu and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Sri Lanka, and the pesticide was controversially classified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as ?likely to cause cancer? in 2016.
However, whether glyphosate has a link to CKDu is still unclear, with the World Health Organisation and Presidential Task Force for CKDu Prevention stating in a joint International Expert Consultation in 2016 that evidence of a link between Glyphosate and CKDu was inconclusive.
Professor of Agriculture Buddhi Marambe from the University of Peradeniya said the decision to ban Glyphosate was made without proven scientific evidence of a causal link between it and CKDu, and highlighted that many problems had resulted from the absence of stakeholder consultation throughout the process.
?There is no proper alternative for weed control as such. Yield of important plants such as maize, have been significantly affected by the glyphosate ban,? Professor Marambe said.
?When a proven technology is taken away, what is the alternative? There should be a cost-effective and environmentally viable alternative available, especially when it is widely used in different industries. We have to strike a balance in all these cases,? he said. (Tilini Rajapaksa)

GMOA opposes appointment of Chief Epidemiologist
	
The entire Epidemiology Unit has been defunct due the Health Ministry?s arbitrary appointment of a medical administrator to the post of Chief Epidemiologist, the Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) said yesterday.
GMOA said it strongly oppose the appointment of the medical administrator as the Chief Epidemiologist who does not have sufficient knowledge or experience to function in that position.
Former Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Paba Palihawadana was appointed as the Director of the Health Promotion Bureau.
She was said to be the most experienced and qualified Epidemiologist with 25 years of experience.
Accordingly medical administrator Dr. Dissanayake was appointed as the Chief Epidemiologist by the Health Ministry.
It was learned that the appointment had been made by ignoring Dr. Samitha Ginige the next in line for the position who was only second to Dr. Paba Palihawadana by experience.
It was revealed that Dr. Ginige had performed as Acting Chief Epidemiologist during Dr. Paba Palihawadana was out of the country.
Daily Mirror reliably learned that Dr Paba Palihawadana had filed a Fundamental Rights Petition in Supreme Court which is to be taken up in due course.
The employees of the Epidemiology Unit had launched a trade union action following the new appointment and it had disrupted smooth operation of the unit.
Meanwhile, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said that the entire country could experience the consequences of trade union action launched by the epidemiology unit.
Therefore, GMOA urged the health authorities to remove the medical administrator from the position immediately. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Health Minister orders SLMC to stop its election
	
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne in a letter sent to the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) has ordered to stop proceedings in the current election of members to the council stating that there would be legal implications.
In a letter dated March 23, the minister had stated that he had received several complaints on conducting the above election without proper election procedure regulations published in the Gazette notification.
?Sri Lanka Medical Council being a public enterprise should adhere to all rules and regulations imposed on them? from time to time. I have instructed the legal draftsman to expedite the publication of above regulations and then I will submit it to the Parliament for approval,? he said.
Meanwhile, addressing a press conference the Government Medical officers? Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge today said that there is a conspiracy to sabotage the SLMC election.
Election to fill four out of eight graduate medical officers? vacancies was held on January 23 and 24 and all the four vacancies were secured by members of the GMOA by 80 to 90 percent of the total number of votes cast.
The GMOA, several months before the election claimed that regulations for the election were not gazetted but the election was held without any interruption due to the unanimous agreement of the related parties.
Therefore, Dr. Aluthge said the health minister is attempting to stop the election preventing the appointment of more GMOA members to SLMC considering its massive victory in the previous election.
Further, Dr. Aluthge said the letter sent by the minister was handed over to the SLMC at a discussion held on Friday (23) however, the majority of SLMC membership decided to abide by the letter and to continue with the election proceedings.
In order to the majority decision the GMOA said that the SLMC Registrar should publicize the election announcement officially by today (28).
GMOA further said it would resort to stern trade union actions if any attempt to delay or halt the election. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Investigators into fatal Russian mall fire say exits were blocked
	
?
Investigators looking into a fire that killed at least 64 people at a busy shopping mall in the Siberian city of Kemerovo said on Monday that a security guard had turned off the fire alarm system and that exits had been illegally blocked.
The fire, one of the deadliest in Russia since the break-up of the Soviet Union, swept through the upper floors of the ?Winter Cherry? shopping center on Sunday afternoon where a cinema complex and children?s play area?were located.
Dozens of children were feared to be among the dead.
President Vladimir Putin, re-elected last weekend, has yet to speak publicly about the tragedy, which has stirred deep anger in Kemerovo, a coal-producing region about 3,600 km (2,200 miles) east?
of Moscow.
The Kremlin published a statement, saying Putin ?expressed his deep condolences to the relatives and loved ones of those?
who died.?
Russia?s Investigative Committee, which handles major crimes, said it was trying to bring in the mall?s owner for questioning and wanted to detain a security guard who had turned off the fire alarm system after learning of the blaze.
?Serious violations (of the law) took place when the mall was being built and when it was functioning. The fire exits were blocked,? Svetlana Petrenko, a spokeswoman for the committee, said in a statement.
She said investigators, who have opened a criminal investigation into the blaze, were looking into other possible violations. Four people have already been detained, including the owners and lessees of outlets inside the mall.
Emergency services said they had extinguished the fire, but later said it had reignited in places, and that rescuers were struggling to recover bodies beneath smoldering rubble.

Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) General Secretary and Minister, Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday it would not support the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe submitted by a group involved in serious financial crimes much worse than the Central Bank bond scam.
He told a news conference that the government had carried out a proper investigation into the scam and brought the culprits to book.
?We have been of the view from the very beginning that the culprits involved in the bond scam should be brought to book. The bond scam had not only caused direct loss to the government but has also resulted in an economic crisis due to the increase in interest rates. The government appointed a PCoI on the matter and arrested those implicated. The government has taken proper action over the matter unlike during the Rajapaksa regime," the minister said.
He said the no-confidence motion was presented by a group involved in serious financial crimes such as MIG deal, which caused a US$6.8 million loss to the State.
?These frauds are worse than the CB bond scam. So we are not supporting a no-confidence motion brought in by such people,? he said and added that there should be immediate reforms in the government and in the UNP, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

No-faith motion against PM illegal: UNP
	
The no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister is illegal because such a motion cannot be brought against him under Section 30 of the Constitution, UNP MP Ashu Marasinghe told a media conference.
He said such a motion had to be against the Government and the President as stated by Section 43 of the Constitution.
?Government, as defined in this Section, comprises the President, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. According to the Constitution, the President is considered a member of the Cabinet,? Dr. Marasinghe said and added that the UNP however, would defeat this motion.
He said this motion was a part of a larger conspiracy by the joint opposition with Speaker Karu Jayasuriya being targetted next followed by an impeachment motion against President Maithripala Sirisena.
Referring to a statement made by State Minister Palitha Range Bandara that more than 20 UNP MPs would vote in favour of the motion, Dr. Marasinghe said what Mr. Bandara had not mentioned was that UNPers would consider voting for the motion if the party was not reorganized before April 4.
He said the party?s reorganization would go parallel with the party?s plans to defeat the no-confidence motion. ?UNP will be reorganized before the National New Year,? the MP said and added that it was the UNP which wanted the no-confidence motion debated on April 4 while those in the JO wanted it taken up before the National New Year.
UNP MP Wijepala Hettiarachchi said those who brought the no-confidence motion are the ones who are charged with financial crimes and pointed out that the cases of corruption would be expedited through the Judicature Bill.
The two MPs said if anyone in the government voted in favour of the motion they would have to sit in the opposition. (Yohan Perera)

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said it was the SLFP members who proclaimed at first that stringent actions should be taken against the offenders of the controversial bond scam.?
?The attempts of the SLFP became successful and culminated in appointing a Presidential Commission to inquire into the so called bond fraud,? Dissanayake said.
?We, as a party have not yet decided whether to vote against or in favour of the no faith motion against Premier Wickremesinghe. However, we have to admit to the fact that there was a considerable decline in the economy consequent to the bond scam. Therefore, our support of the no faith motion is not one that is against the government or President Maithripala Sirisena but for the well-being of the country,? Dissanayake added.? ? ? ? ? ? ??

Maha Nayaka Thera of the Malwatta Chapter Most Ven. Thibbatuwawe Sri Sumangala Thera today told a group of European Union Ambassadors that it was not justifiable to label the violent incidents occurred in Theldeniya as communal violence.
The group of EU Ambassadors including Switzerland Ambassador Heinz Walter Nederkoorn, Romanian Ambassador Victor Chiudea and headed by EU Ambassador Tung-Lai Margue called on the Mahanayake Theras of the Malwatta and Asgiriya Chapters today in the aftermath of the Kandy violence.
Most Ven. Thibbatuwawe Sri Sumangala Thera went on to say that Buddhists follow the concept of non-violence and that they are not barbarians to oppress Muslims.
?These incidents are no way a result of communal violence. Racism is not only in Sri Lanka but everywhere in the world including the US, Europe and even in India,? the prelate said.
Meanwhile, the Registrar of the Asgiriya Chapter Ven. Medagama Dhammananda Thera said Muslims religious centres had been established even within the lands owned by Buddhist Temples.

12% of the Govt. teachers unable to teach
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said the education authorities had informed him that 10% to 12% of the 350,000 teacher population in the national education system did not have the ability or experience to teach a single subject or even to train students at least in extracurricular activities.
He said the government incurred a massive amount of funds for free health, free education, subsidies and other welfare facilities and the time was right to review these services to make them more people-oriented.
The President said this at the 35th Annual General Meeting of the of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association (SLASA) at the ?Nelum Pokuna? Performing Arts Theater yesterday.
?I had a long discussion with education authorities yesterday to sort out problems in the national education system. These officials told me that there are 4.2 million people and 350,000 teachers in the national education system. They also told me that 12% of the teachers do not have experience or skills to teach a single subject or train students in extracurricular activities. There is no doubt that this is going to be a pressing issue in the free education system,? he said.
The President requested public officials not to be upset by the political theatrics enacted in Sri Lanka?s body politic.
?The entire world at the moment is entangled with many problems. They may be of religious, social, economical or terrorism. We hear more often than not about incidents of gun violence in the US. Free use of guns is common in the US. We hear shooting on innocent people, school students and pedestrians dastardly killing of many innocent people and students. That is what US is where so-called five-star democracy is reigned," he said. ?The public expect an efficient, clean and unblemished service from you and deliver them to the utmost satisfaction of the people is of paramount importance under whatever drawbacks you confront in the way."

Sri Lanka Terribly short of sign language interpreters
	
As of now there is a deaf and hearing impaired population of more than 400,000 in Sri Lanka. Although suffering from this disability, they are full citizens of this country having the same needs as any other stakeholder. If you come to think of it, what difficulties must the deaf and hearing impaired be facing if they are not able to understand what is related using spoken language? How would a deaf or hearing impaired individual get his requirements fulfilled in a hospital or a police station if he or she is not able to understand what is spoken by the officers who are on duty?
In all these processes, an important middle-person whose role is crucial for those in this cross section of the population to access and benefit from public services is the Sign Language Interpreter. A Sign Language Interpreter is someone who helps hearing impaired or deaf individuals understand a spoken language by converting it into sign language.? ?
It was alarming to know when Shammi Dias and Dinesh Manjula Fernando spoke to the Daily Mirror that there are only six (6) Sign Language Interpreters to serve the entire island at the moment. (They are Shammi Dias, Janaka Gunawardhane, Kanchana Priyadarshanie, Deshika Senevirathne, Niluka Sanjeewani and Dinesh Manjula Fernando). Compared to the 400,000 or more who need their services on a daily basis, this number is way off proportion.? ?
While three of them, including Dinesh and Shammi are based in the Department of Social Services, Sethsiripaaya, the others are stationed across three of the four vocational centres around the country. Their work load is huge. The six have allocated themselves 3 to 4 districts and try to provide their services as efficiently as possible.? ?
Dias, the first ever Sign Language Interpreter appointed in Sri Lanka, spoke of the nature and the quantum of work included in the services?
they perform.? ?
?As Sign Language Interpreters serving the Government, we are bound to provide our services whenever requested. When some information is required to be communicated to a deaf or hearing impaired person, who seeks the service of a public establishment like in a hospitals, police stations and courts, we are obliged to go there and assist the process of communication. There are days when we have to go to three of four courts in different parts of the island to offer a translator?s service for deaf people who are either victims, alleged perpetrators or witnesses in litigation of very sensitive private cases like rape, divorce and domestic violence. One case is heard over several sessions and we must somehow attend?each session.? ?
?
Not all the 400,000 deaf and hearing impaired population is educated
Attentive and sensitive? ?
In addition to this we have to translate news broadcasts through television (Rupavahini Channel) every night as part of our job. The six of us are always engaged in some work or the other and it is a responsibility that we shoulder when performing our jobs. We are aiding a destitute section of our population and we must be very attentive and also sensitive to their needs,? said Shammi.? ?
?
When asked about translating Tamil language into sign language Fernando said that the situation is more difficult.? ?
?There is even more difficulty when it comes to extending our services to the North and East where there must be someone to translate what is spoken in Tamil to Sinhalese and it is then only that we can interpret it in sign language to the individual in need. There is no one competent in Tamil among us, so when it comes to translating Tamil spoken language, the work is doubled,? said Fernando.? ?
?
When inquired about the steps already taken by the State in furtherance of serving the needs of the deaf and hearing impaired community, Fernando cited a few instances, mostly spearheaded by initiatives of the?international community.? ?
?With the recognition of sign language as a separate language which must be respected in the international community, and the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities last year by the Government, steps have been taken to uplift services to differently-abled people as a whole. The most important commitment under the convention is to provide full access to services designed for disabled people of all kinds.? ?
??Like with the need to build elevators and accessible pathways for wheelchair users, providing access to services for the deaf and hearing impaired is to make communication possible or easier for them when utilising public services. In pursuance of this, there is a six-month course conducted for Government officials where basic sign language is taught to them, so that they can at least help the deaf and hearing impaired people by rendering their services. This is done to provide officials with the correct knowledge of sign language and direct them to the correct portal. A growing number of deaf and hearing impaired people are benefiting from this type of service in banks and other institutions as a result of the presence of officials who have received a training,? said Fernando.? ?

?
One year diploma? ?
?In response to a complaint made by the deaf and hearing impaired population that there are not enough sign language interpreters, after overcoming bureaucratic and funding challenges, the Department of Social Services, the Ministry of Social Empowerment headed by Minister S.B. Dissanayake, the National Institute of Social Development and the Department of Divineguma in a collective initiative trained 50 people belonging to Samurdhi families from all districts except the North and East to function as Sign Language Interpreters. These language interpreters after completing an year-long diploma received appointments. This programme was strengthened after a cabinet paper was passed. They will soon join us, after which our work will be distributed among them. They will be located in district hospitals, courts and District Secretariats, and also schools for the deaf and hearing impaired and vocational centres. Once the bureaucratic processes are completed and more interpreters are trained, there would ideally be an interpreter in every public institution and establishment ready to serve the deaf and hearing impaired people,??
opined Shammi.? ?
Answering a question whether there were any Tamil-speaking persons who were trained for this job, Shammi said that it would happen only in a second stage of the training where half the batch will be recruited from the North and East. This recruitment is scheduled for May.? ?
How they started? ?
The reasons for Shammi and Fernando to become Sign Language Interpreters, given that it is less-known occupation, are personal. Shammi?s aunt and uncle, with whom she had spent most of her childhood, are deaf. Her uncle, an artist, who had been in the first committee formed by the National Institute of Education, has frequently had deaf and hearing impaired persons visiting his home. Fernando has forged close friendships with his travel companions on his way to work. These people were hard of hearing. It was by chance that Fernando learned sign language to communicate with his friends. Some of the other interpreters had worked with deaf and other disabled people in NGOs and later decided to take to?this profession.? ?
The Director of the Department of Social Services Wajira Kamburugamuwa also reiterated the great extent of work carried out by the existing sing language interpreters as they sometimes have to travel from one end of the island to the other to offer their services. He also said that arrangements are in place to increase the salaries of Government officials who are trained in sign language. He called for more support from the funding avenues and the community at large to help the deaf and hearing impaired and other disabled people to do better?in life.? ?
Shammi and Fernando spoke in general about the situation of the deaf and hearing impaired population in?Sri Lanka.? ?
?Not all the 400,000 deaf and hearing impaired population is educated. Affluent parents have admitted them to schools, but there are so many deaf and impaired people who have never been to a school, particularly in rural areas. Even if they attend school, not many continue till the Advanced Level Examination. They even learn sign language on their own, at their homes, and brush it up when entering the society. Because we have worked extensively in all parts of the country, we are well versed in the varied informal signs used by them and are able to interpret to them. Deaf and hearing impaired people are comfortable communicating with us, so sometimes even if they have issues with paying the water or electricity bills, they head to the Department for Social Services,? they said.? ?
?
Shammi and Fernando opined that Sri Lanka is not sensitive to the needs of these people. They said that Sri Lankans are used to looking at someone with a disability with sympathy. ?What we need to realize is that the disabilities in these people must not be allowed to prevent them from functioning as ordinary citizens. The society should be more aware and public institutions must be well equipped to serve a disabled person and not compel them to be isolated from the rest of the society because of this condition, which has no cure,? they added.? ?
There is no one competent in Tamil among us, so when it comes to translating Tamil spoken language, the work?
is doubled

Stalemate over appointment of chairman
	
?
There are two Pohottuwa co-organizers appointed to an electorate in the South and they have gone gung-ho in promoting a loyalist of their?s as the chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha in their area.

The party high-ups too have found it difficult to resolve this issue which has put the two co-organizers at loggerheads as both members backed by them have polled an equal number of votes at the recent mini-poll.?

Stormy Daniels claims she was threatened
	
?
US, (Daily Mail), 26 March 2018 - Stormy Daniels (an adult film actress) says she had unprotected sex with Donald Trump and spanked him with a magazine that had his face on the cover, even though she wasn?t physically attracted to him.??
The porn star also claims a mystery man threatened her and her infant daughter in 2011 after she tried to expose her 2006 tryst with the president in a lucrative magazine interview, and kept silent until now out of fear.??
The 39-year-old adult actress made the bombshell statements on 60 Minutes on Sunday night in her highly-anticipated interview with Anderson Cooper, after dodging questions about her relationship with the president for months.??
Reports of their illicit fling came to light in January, when it was reported that Trump?s personal lawyer Michael Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 to sign a non-disclosure agreement just 11 days before the 2016 presidential election.??
Cohen has denied ever threatening her. He did not return 60 Minutes? request for comment before the interview aired.??
Daniels is now suing Trump over the hush agreement and claims it is void.??

The story of a song, an uncle, and a niece
	
PART I
?
There are songs that remain etched in our minds long after we listen to them and long, long after we forget the first time we came across them. They bring to mind certain experiences that we like to forget but for some inscrutable reason don?t want to forget. Like schooldays. First crushes. Unfulfilled romances. Friendships that sour into enmities. And so on. Either way, for better or worse, the words we hum and the tunes we strum stay with us for the simple reason that such songs, the best of them at least, were meant to be retained in the repository of our collective imagination. In other words, they were initially conceived to be as unprofessional and simple as possible. They lend flavour to experience and help us associate a particular memory, bitter or jovial, with a certain time and place.??
Just as there are stories behind the first times we hear such tunes, however, there are also stories behind the how, when, and wherefore of those tunes, those who ideated and came up with the melody, those who wrote down the lyrics, and those who lent their voices. Out of 100-odd songs, I?m willing to wager that not even 30 can boast of such worthy prefaces. But those 30 sadly tend to be overlooked, because we aren?t really bothered about their foreword. Who?d have thought, for instance, that Ajantha Ranasinghe wrote ?Tharu Arundathi? after coming across a girl down the street whom he never dared to introduce himself to???
This is the story of one such song. Before I get to it, though, I need to get to the names of those involved in it. Two names. Victor Silva and Nirasha Perera.??
?
Few would know of Victor and Nirasha and fewer would know that they were the two vocalists behind the song they ended up singing, right before it was appropriated, unjustly I should think, by other more established vocalists
Few would know of Victor and Nirasha and fewer would know that they were the two vocalists behind the song they ended up singing, right before it was appropriated, unjustly I should think, by other more established vocalists. Indeed, outside their immediate circle not many would believe that they were destined to become professionals in the field, right before the professions they?d carved for themselves through their education got them out of that field.??
Let?s start with Victor. Victor had a passion for singing. From an early age. But there was a problem. His father didn?t want him to sing. He wanted him to become a Chartered Accountant, back then (as of now) a lucrative career. So during his early schoolboy days at Holy Cross College, Kalutara (his hometown), he didn?t pursue music despite the fact that he could perform quite well. Things changed, however, when he shifted to St Aloysius? College in Galle and became a boarder. The priest in charge of the boarders was Father Debura, straight from Italy. He was also in charge of the Choir. Naturally, the Father tried the boarders out with their voices. Having heard Victor, he selected him then and there.??
Victor obviously had a problem with his father and this he confided to the Reverend Father. The Reverend Father, thankfully, understood him well. ?Don?t worry, tell him to see me,? he confidently told the young man, and the next time the parents of the boarders came to meet the priests and the rectors who ran the school, Victor readily took his mother and father to meet Father Debura. The Father had only one question to ask: ?Mr Silva, would you like your son to use his voice to sing the praises of God?? The question, craftily crafted, won Victor?s father over: ?No Father. Let him sing!? Remembering this conversation decades later, for me, Victor had one thing to say: ?By the grace of God, and also Father Debura, I didn?t let my voice waste away!? Subsequently, he was taken in.??
In 1965, St Aloysius? took in Anton Weerasinghe, a layman practising and learning to become a priest (what one called a Scholast). Weerasinghe was versatile, with an ability to play the tabla and guitar and also to compose. Victor, who took part in various dramas and sang for them as well, soon came under his tutelage, when Weerasinghe got him and a friend of his, Eric Gunaratne, to come up with an original song. Having hankered after a tune and a set of lyrics to fit that tune, the boys finally hit upon an original they could be happy with: ?Suran Menika?. Weerasinghe heard it, smiled, and polished it in his own special way.??
Time passed by rather quickly. Victor left school and moved to Colombo in 1967, having passed his exams well enough to contemplate on his higher education: as usual, in accountancy. Just as it was as looked up to as it is today, however, it was as tough as it is today, so he had to stay at a hostel to get his mind on his education. The hostel he stayed at, situated near Ananda Rajakaruna Mawatha in Borella (back then called Campbell Place), housed several students engaged in various subjects, from medicine to law to engineering to accountancy. Given that they were all boys, they indulged in the usual ?bajaw? session with the guitar (which Victor had by then mastered, to a certain extent). Among those friends he encountered, there was Duleep de Silva, member of the then phenomenally popular Los Flamencos (remember ?Bolanda Katha? and ?Kalu Kelle??) and like Victor an article clerk at a company. ?What happened was this: one fine day, Duleep asked me to come up with a song. He wanted to have it recorded.???
Neither Duleep nor Victor could versify. But they had another friend, a medical student called Nihal de Silva. Whenever Victor strummed a tune, he would rush to Nihal and the two of them would brainstorm a set of lyrics to suit that tune. So having brainstormed over and over again with respect to the tune that came up at Duleep?s request, the two of them hit on an original. They titled it ?Bale Bale?, a mock, tongue-in-cheek reference to the bales of used cloth material that were imported during the Sirimavo Bandaranaike regime (owing to the fact that imports were restricted on all fronts). To crown what they done, they then came up with two more songs: ?Pasal Kaale?, a ditty on the evolution of schoolboys from students to lovers, and ?Suneetha?, composed by Anton Weerasinghe, by now domiciled in Manila. Having heard all three with ?Suran Menika?, Duleepa took Victor and Nihal to meet Gerald Wickremesooriya.??
?
Several stints at the SLBC English Commercial Service aboard the Sooriya Show (hosted by Vijaya Corea, who introduced him as a ?rising star?) later, Victor found himself returning to the career he?d left behind, in Accountancy, when (?by the grace of God?) he managed to pass his exams quite well
Gerald, who had started the Sooriya label, was thrilled. He got them to come to his residence, in Colpetty. Having gotten hold of another popular performer, Chandima de Alwis (band member of The Spitfires, a beat group), apparently now domiciled in Australia, they all went and met Gerald and ultimately persuaded him to record all four songs. The recording, Victor remembers, was done by Patrick Denipitiya, an Old Boy of St Aloysius?, and was completed by the end of 1970. The following year, at the height of the insurrection, the four of them would record four more songs at the Dalugama Studios, polishing up the recording from 6 pm to 6 am. ?Back then, if you got one tune or word wrong, you had no option but to start from scratch all over again!? Victor tells me.??
Several stints at the SLBC English Commercial Service aboard the Sooriya Show (hosted by Vijaya Corea, who introduced him as a ?rising star?) later, Victor found himself returning to the career he?d left behind, in Accountancy, when (?by the grace of God?) he managed to pass his exams quite well. ?My father was extremely happy. I had proved to him that I could sing and balance the books.? By 1972, he was working comfortably (?to my heart?s content?) at the Ceylon Tobacco Company. But before he abandoned singing, at least for a short while, he?d meet one person who?d figure in his life a few years later: Nimal Mendis.??
This is where Nirasha comes in. Victor married Nirasha?s mother?s younger sister in 1973. When the two of them would meet at family parties, they?d almost always be selected to perform middle class ?baila? and pop tunes like ?Koheda Yanne Rukmani??, which was first performed and popularised at Nirasha?s school (Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya) and was a rehashed version of the nursery rhyme ?Where Are You Going My Pretty Maid?? Uncle and niece would meet each other for a more serious song, however, when in 1978 Nimal Mendis, composing the music for Sumitra Peries?s film Ganga Addara, requested him to perform a theme song. There was a catch though: he had to perform it with a small girl. ?Obviously, Nirasha fitted the bill!? Victor heartily chortles.??

A zonal director of education was taking a ride in his car along with a Central school principal and a primary school principal after sharing a bottle or two with them, when a Police party flagged down the vehicle.
?
Finding the zonal director at the wheel well-soaked, Police told him that they had to arrest him and produce him in court for driving under the influence of liquor. In an angry response, the zonal director had mentioned the name of a powerful politico as a good friend of his and threatened the Police officers that he would complain to him if they tried to ?harass? him.?
The police officers had told him he could not drive a vehicle after liquor just because he was a friend of an influential politico. A heated argument had ensued between the drunken threesome and the police officers.? The drunks were locked up in a cell.??
Meanwhile, the OIC received a phone call from the leading politico?s office asking him to go easy on the drunken trio, who were severely warned and released after sleeping it off in the Police cell.

UN introduces new rules for SL peace keeping troops: Army awaits HRC clearance
	
The Sri Lanka Army has sought clearance from the SL Human Rights Commission to dispatch a contingent of troops to Lebanon, following new procedures set up by the UN relating to local troops sent for Peace Keeping assignments.
As a Troop Contributing Country (TCC) to the United Nations, Sri Lanka has been in the practice of sending troops for UN Peace Keeping assignments since 2004, when the country qualified to do so, the army said. ?
?
The Army said that a contingent of 150 soldiers of the Army, earmarked for deployment were set to leave for Lebanon in batches as replacements, from February this year and the first batch of 49 troops had left for Lebanon on February 18 and 19.
However, the UN Department of Peace Keeping Operations (DPKO) has insisted that Sri Lanka should seek feasible clearance for such deployments directly from the Sri Lankan Human Rights Commission (SLHRC) by vetting respective overseas bound UN candidates before their departure.
As a result of this change of procedures, the Army was compelled to refer the remaining batch of 101 Army personnel for necessary screening as advised by the UNDPKO.
At present, Sri Lankan troops, a majority being from the Sri Lanka Army have been deployed to Lebanon (UNIFIL), South Sudan (UNMISS), Mali (MINUSMA), Abyei (UNISFA), New York (UNHQ), Central African Republic (MINUSCA) and Western Sahara (MINURSO), either as military observers, staff officers, staff officer assistants or general contingent troops.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

We have no National Policy to combat bribery and corruption right now
	
?
The?Dailymirror discussed bribery and corruption, its prevention and prosecution of suspects with the Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), Sarath Jayamanne PC.
Excerpts:
?
?Q The public, the media and politicians charge more often than not that the CIABOC has failed to bring before the law those big time perpetrators like politicians and top officials in the public sector who had allegedly engaged in bribery and corruption. What do you have to say on?this allegation??
The CIABOC solely and entirely investigate, establish a case and file charges against suspects of bribery or corruption on the availability of evidence. I agree that there is some merit in the public perception that the CIABOC has not brought big fish and only small or middle level public officials and politicians before the law. What I want to emphasize is that almost all big time perpetrators or suspects of bribery or corruption do it in an extremely professional way. Whether he or she is a top politician or senior and influential public official they take bribes, commissions, immovable or movable assets or gratuities using technology. Their transactions don?t leave any trail and lucre ill-amassed using IT are in many instances not found in Sri Lanka. They are usually changed hands as foreign bank accounts, foreign assets or shares in?foreign companies.??
?
In 2017, there were a record conviction of 57 which was the highest in a year. The CIABOC also deploys sleuths at sensitive state institutions prone to bribe taking. In the recent past we have been able to arrest a number of school principals and top level police officers red handed and even persecuted a couple of top most former and incumbent officials of the judiciary.
?
?Besides, when our sleuths make inquiries on those ill gotten wealth, they have to confront various laws, regulations and secrecy laws of the respective countries and banks. All top level suspects are professionals and they know how to do it without leaving a clue for us to inquire and catch them. In short, in many cases it is a professional job. They don?t do it in a rest room, wash room, on the roadside or in their office. It is normally a big job involving big money and assets. Also in a transaction carried out using IT, you don?t find names or the identity of the giver or taker. They are nameless and they have only a number. So, this is the situation not only in Sri Lanka but in any other country. After a regime change , politicians and top officials clear their desks, files and computers erasing any sign of grey spots in their tenure.? ?
?
?Q Does that mean you need more legal teeth, human resources and logistical support to do a better job?
Yes indeed. The CIABOC Act No 19 of 1994 is obsolete and archaic and has not been amended for the last 28 years. Therefore, we have confronted many a hitch in our work at the CIABOC.? ?
The amendments to the CIABOC Act is the first priority and we have in place a ?National Action Plan? to combat bribery and corruption in Sri Lanka which will look into amending laws on bribery or corruption in addition to introducing a corruption prevention scheme. Sadly we have no National Policy to combat bribery and corruption right now. A 50-member team will be appointed to formulate a plan with special attention given to prevention programmes.? ?
Amendments to the bribery laws which has received the cabinet nod include allowing bribery cases to be filed in High Court instead of the Magistrate Courts to fast track cases and to allow CIABOC to direct serious cases to High Court where they can arrange a 3-Judge Bench to hear such cases on a daily basis. The CIABOC will also bring in laws to allow to use evidence from Presidential Commissions to investigate into corruption or investigate their findings further. I personally believe that the CIABOC must be given more power to work independently.? ?
Other hindrance faced by the CIABOC is that it has no power to recruit its own officers directly and investigations, raids and analysis are done by Police officers obtained from the Department of Police (DOP) and they are under the command of the IGP. They are controlled by the DoP and can be assigned for special duties outside the CIABOC. Therefore, it is obvious that the CIABOC is dependent on sources outside of its purview and disciplinary control. This is one of the incapacitating factors affecting the CIABOC.? ?
?
We must put more emphasis to create a culture that grows in the minds of people that bribery and corruption is a crime, a disease and social evil that goes against all civilized and democratic norms of a country
?
However, we are in the process of recruiting 200 officers with the cabinet approval for the CIABOC and they would be given a thorough training by local and foreign experts with the assistance of the UNDP and the World Bank. I have also sent our officials for training in Hong Kong and I paid a visit to Bhutan recently with a team of officials where bribery and corruption is non-existent.? ?
There are certain grey areas of the CIABOC Act that one can get confused as to who could prosecute a suspect under one of the Sections of the Act. These provisions have to be amended.? ?
However, I am sad to note that though I have overtaken almost all the hurdles thrown to me from the government agencies to secure a land to construct a spacious and decent building with modern facilities but the Urban Development Authority (UDA) blocks it for no?obvious reason.? ?
?
The most corrupt countries in the world according to the index are Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan and Yemen among 180 countries with scores above 175. Sri Lanka is at not so satisfactory 91
?
?Q Why politicians and public officials solicit bribes to perform a legitimate duty?
I think this is where we must put more emphasis to create a culture that grows in the minds of people that bribery and corruption is a crime, a disease and social evil that goes against all civilized and democratic norms of a country. They must realize that it is a social stigma and compromises the dignity of the giver and taker of the bribe. That is why we need national policy on prevention of Bribery and Corruption and students must be taught on the evil effects of it.? ?
In Bhutan, one of the prominent South Asian countries where bribery and corruption is unheard of, politicians and public officials do not accept even a gift from any one. If they cannot refuse a gift, they accept it, fill a form with all information pertaining to the gift and place the gift in a vault, showcase or cupboard as a public property.? ?
?
?Q Two former Parliamentarians were fined Rs.1,000 each for their failure to declare their assets making the entire process of fighting corruption a joke. Your comments on this...?
We are in the process of amending the law and various proposals on this matter are being reviewed. One of the proposals was to increase the fine to Rs.100,000 from the current Rs.1,000 and also the prison term from current one year. I believe that with the approval of the amendments to the CIABOC Act No.19 of 1994 in Parliament in near future all these issues debilitating the CIABOC will be addressed.? ?
?
?Q Bribery and corruption are deep rooted in developing the so-called third world countries. Do financial crimes have a link to poverty?
Yes and no. I cannot vouch for the presumption that developed or rich countries have fully eradicated bribery or corruptions because we more often than not watch, read and hear stories of bribery and corruption those countries. But I can safely say that in many developed countries this evil acts are not entrenched in the society, in the public or governance and most importantly people in those countries are feared of giving and taking bribes. It is simply a stigma in the society.? ?
If you make a search on the recently released Corruption Perception Index of 2017 by the Transparency International, you will see that the top ten countries with highest marks for the prevention of bribery and corruption in the developed countries with top most ranking of 1st place among 180 countries is held by New Zealand while almost all the Scandinavian countries like Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden coming to first five rankings. Other rich countries like Switzerland, Canada, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Britain ranking in the first 10. The richest country in the world, US is on 16 and best in Asia in corruption busting is Singapore at 6th and in South Asia Bhutan at 26.? ?
The most corrupt countries in the world according to the index are Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan and Yemen among 180 countries with scores above 175. Sri Lanka is at a not-so-satisfactory score of 91.? ?
Officials and politicians in poor or low income countries are usually prone to solicit and accept bribes. People in those countries compel to Greece the palm of officials and politicians to get done an official function. It is no secret that politicians expect a gratuity when jobs are given, a fat commission to approve a project or a tender and officials solicit a ?santhosam? [gratification] to give a transfer, admit a pupil to school, approve a payment or release a cheque. In courts to put a case on the top of the files, in prisons to give extra time to a prisoner to chat with family member or even to supply drugs.? ?
The system needs a complete overhaul. People must be taught from the kindergarten level to say a firm ?No? to bribe taking and giving. It must be embedded in our blood, make it a national policy and a habit in the society like in those countries where this evil has been fully eradicated.? ?
?
?Q What are the measures taken by the CIABOC to control bribery and corruption in the country?
The most effective tool to fend off, discourage or create a fear psychosis among the people resorting to give bribe and politicians and officials to soliciting and accepting bribes is to give wide publicity to convictions for bribery and corruption. In addition we have instructed state institutions to create an environment in their respective institutions that bribing is not necessary for the public to give gratuities to get an official and lawful service from officials. The CIABOC conducts awareness programmes regularly at state institutions to educate public officials to repercussions of taking bribes.? ?
In 2017, there were a record conviction of 57 which was the highest in a year. The CIABOC also deploys sleuths at sensitive state institutions prone to bribe taking. In the recent past we have been able to arrest a number of school principals and top level police officers red handed and even persecuted a couple of top most former and incumbent officials of the judiciary. These are in addition to new amendments to be introduced to the CIABOC Act and new legislations.? ?
The CIABOC is to introduce a new and simple form to declare assets and establish a data base with newest available technology to scrutinize, categorize and preserve assets declaration by opticians and public officials. A public officer will have to submit online his or her assets declaration even after one year of retirement. In many instances, public officials used to explain unusual amassing of assets or assets beyond his or her means as winning a sweet jackpot, from a close relative or from a relative living overseas etc. The new form of assets declaration has addressed this weakness.? ?
?
?Q What is the biggest drawback you have confronted in the fight against bribery and corruption?
Lack of human resources and other logistical infrastructure mainly. The CIABOC as I said earlier needs concrete evidence to establish a water tight case against a suspect. It is counter productive to file charges against a suspect with not so strong evidence. A big majority of complaints or petitions we get are anonymous. Those who send petitions to the CIABOC on corruptions and illegal assets don?t come foreword in many instances to give evidence.?
?
?Q I have heard you say that a legal arm like CIABOC does not exist in countries where bribery and corruption are unheard of. Can you further?explain this?
Yes, in New Zealand, Scandinavian countries, EU nations and Canada where bribery and corruption have almost been eradicated, the maladies do not exist.? ?
