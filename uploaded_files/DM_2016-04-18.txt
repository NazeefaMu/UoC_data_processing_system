Choosing new IGP: Join opp. objects to Champika's participation
	
The joint opposition yesterday requested President Maithripala Sirisena and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to ensure that Megapolis and Western Region Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka does not participate in the meeting of the Constitutional Council (CC) scheduled for today to discuss the appointment of the next Inspector General of Police (IGP), it is learnt.
Mr. Ranawaka is the member nominated by the President to the CC, which is chaired by the Speaker by virtue of his office.
The joint opposition, in a letter signed by its parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane and a few other MPs such Bandula Gunawardane and Vasudeva Nanayakkara, said that was a police investigation concerning Mr. Ranawaka's alleged involvement in a road accident and that he should, therefore, not be a part of a body that would choose the next police head.
The letter said there were also court proceedings in this regard.

Dematagoda abduction: CCD awaits AG's opinion
	
Colombo additional Magistrate Mohammad Mihar today postponed the inquiry relating to the incident of abducting a 34-year-old man in Dematagoda, where MP Hirunika Premachandra and eight others were found suspects, for August 8 since the Attorney Generals opinion was pending on the matter.
The CCD submitting a further report told Court that it had sent extracts of the investigation to the Attorney General for his consideration.
The Police also informed Court that the report on the CCTV footage, sent to the Colombo Computer School for clarification, had not been received.
On December 21, a 34-year-old man was abducted and assaulted by a group of individuals, who had arrived in a Defender vehicle, which was alleged to have belonged to MP Premachandra.
The suspects were released on bail and the Defender was released to the owner by Court. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Ecuador earthquake: Deaths rise to 246
	
At least 246 people have been confirmed dead and more than 1,500 people injured after Ecuador was hit by its most powerful earthquake in decades.
Some 10,000 troops and 3,500 police are being deployed in the affected areas, as rescue operations continue.
The magnitude-7.8 quake struck on Saturday evening.
Coastal areas in the north-west were closest to the epicentre and officials say the death toll is likely to rise as information begins to come in.
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa has cut short a visit to Italy to deal with the crisis.
He has declared a state of emergency and said the priority is finding survivors.
"Everything can be rebuilt, but lives cannot be recovered, and that's what hurts the most," he said.
Ecuador's Vice-President Jorge Glas, visiting one of the worst-hit cities, Manta, met a resident who pleaded for people trapped under rubble.
"We cannot go in with heavy machinery because it can be tragic for the wounded," Mr Glas told him.
Helicopters and buses are ferrying troops north but have been hampered by landslides.
In some areas people are using their bare hands to try to dig out survivors.(BBC)

400 feared dead after boat capsizes between Egypt and Italy
	
More than 400 migrants and refugees are feared to have drowned in the Mediterranean while trying to cross by boat from Egypt to Italy, the Telegraph reported today.
They are believed to be largely Somalis, with smaller numbers of Eritreans and Ethiopians.
The tragedy, if confirmed, comes exactly a year after the worst migrant disaster in the Mediterranean for decades.
The migrants involved in Monday's tragedy were on board four boats, according to BBC Arabic, which broke the story.
One or more of the boats appears to have capsized at sea.
The Somali embassy in Cairo is trying to verify the reports, which have not yet been verified.
The vast majority of refugees and migrants who reach Italy by sea depart in old fishing boats and rubber dinghies from the coast of Libya, where chaos since the downfall of the Gadaffi regime has allowed people smuggling gangs to flourish.

65,000 houses; Sampanthan expresses serious concern
	
The Opposition (and Tamil National Alliance) leader R. Sampanthan has expressed very serious concerns about the initiative to construct 65,000 houses for conflict-affected families in the Northern and Eastern provinces.
In letters to the President and the Prime Minister, Mr. Sampanthan said: The TNA strongly recommends that the Government undertake a review of the initiative in question, and properly address, all of the concerns (mentioned below) in implementing this, or any other initiative to address the housing crisis in the North and East.
The TNA thus welcomes the Governments recognition of this, and its resolve to initiate a project to provide housing for conflict affected families. However, the serious concerns relating to the initiative in question repeatedly raised by a wide ranging group of civil society activists, professionals, and politicians cannot be ignored.
Among the concerns mentioned were: the tender procedure that led to the selection of Arcellor-Mittal Construction France, the durability of the houses, the environmental unsuitability of the proposed houses and the cost of each house.
Together with the present Government your Excellency, has been public in your commitment to bring about reconciliation. Initiatives to help conflict affected communities rebuild their homes and lives are important opportunities in this regard. However, merely using such opportunities for political mileage and disregarding the true needs of the Tamil People of the North and East can only be reflective of an unwillingness to effectively honour this commitment, the letter added.
Full letter;
18th April 2016
His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena
Presidential Secretariat
Galle Face
Colombo 01
Your Excellency,
Initiative to construct 65,000 Houses for Conflict-affected Families in the Northern and Eastern Provinces
I write consequent to a unanimous decision of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Parliamentary Group to raise very serious concerns in respect of the above matter.
The housing needs of the North and East are indeed dire. It is estimated that 137,000 houses are necessary to meet the housing needs of the North and the East following the devastation of the war. This issue must be addressed. The TNA thus welcomes the Governments recognition of this, and its resolve to initiate a project to provide housing for conflict affected families. However, the serious concerns relating to the initiative in question repeatedly raised by a wide ranging group of civil society activists, professionals, and politicians cannot be ignored. This includes the recent report of experts of the University of Moratuwa on the suitability of the abovementioned steel houses. Following are some of the primary concerns that have been raised:
a) Concerns relating to the tender process selecting Arcellor-Mittal Construction France
Several concerns have been raised with regard to irregularities in the abovementioned tender process. Of particular concern is the fact that the decision to award the contract to the abovementioned company seems to have been made long before the tender process even commenced, as far back as August 2015.
b) Concerns relating to the durability of the houses
Several concerns have been raised in this regard. Experts state that the proposed prefabricated houses will not last for more than 10 years. Indeed, the model houses of this scheme which were erected recently have already  in a matter of a few weeks  started coming apart.
For the conflict affected communities in the North and East, a house is not merely a means of shelter, but an inextricable part of their culture. A house passes down from generation to generation; parents build a house with the hope of one day giving it to their children. For the Tamil People, a house is thus part of ones culture, history and heritage, and is expected to last for several generations. Thus, these concerns relating to durability are a matter of especially great concern.
c) The environmental unsuitability of the proposed houses
The proposed houses are to be built of steel, instead of brick. This makes the houses extremely unsuitable for a tropical country like Sri Lanka. This is particularly so given the rapidly rising temperature and humidity levels. 

d) The cost of each house:
Under the present scheme, the cost of each house is estimated to be Rs. 2.1. million. This is 2-3 times more than the more environmentally suitable, durable, permanent brick house provided under the Indian housing scheme which provided 50,000 houses in the North. This fact is of greater concern in a context where the housing need exceeds 130,000 and the Government is offering 65,000 - half of that number.
e)  Implementation of the said construction project (employing local labour)
Similar to housing, another serious concern in the North is unemployment. In these circumstances, serious consideration must be given to use the opportunity provided by such a construction project to facilitate the use of available local labour.
In these circumstances, the TNA strongly recommends that the Government undertake a review of the initiative in question, and properly address all of the above concerns in implementing this, or any other initiative to address the housing crisis in the North and East.
The Governments resolve to address the housing need of the North and East is indeed commendable. However, all such efforts must take into consideration the needs and culture of the people themselves, and long term implications the initiative will have on the community. It is only then that such efforts can be an effective part of reconciliation. Such efforts must not, instead, fall prey to corruption and become a means of benefiting a powerful few.
Together with the present Government your Excellency, has been public in your commitment to bring about reconciliation. Initiatives to help conflict affected communities rebuild their homes and lives are important opportunities in this regard. However, merely using such opportunities for political mileage and disregarding the true needs of the Tamil People of the North and East can only be reflective of an unwillingness to effectively honour this commitment.
On behalf of the TNA and the Tamil People, I urge Your Excellency, together with this Government, not to waste this opportunity. If the Government is committed to reconciliation, then its actions must reflect that. For its part, the TNA remains committed to constructively engaging with both Your Excellency and the Government in order to bring about true reconciliation in this country.

May Day rally: MS will take final decision on MR
	
The Central Committee (CC) of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will certainly take strict disciplinary action against SLFP MPs who would refuse to attend the Partys May Day rally at Galle, a Minister said today.
Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe told the media at the Information Department that the SLFP had invited all SLFP Parliamentarians to attend its May Day rally.
Responding to a journalist who recalled the SLFP Central Committees failure to take any action against those who participated in the joint oppositions public rally at Hyde Park on March 17 despite warnings to do so, Minister Samarasinghe said President Sirisena did not take action against them for the love of the party.
Failure to punish them must not be taken as a weakness. Presidents position was that those detractors of the party should be given another opportunity to follow party instructions. But the situation is different this time. The MPs have been given ample time to behave themselves. The CC will definitely take action against those who attend the proposed joint opposition rally at Kirulapone, Minister Samarasinghe said.
Asked whether action would be taken against Mr. Rajapaksa if he attended the Kirulapona meeting, he said, yes and added the final decision on him will be taken by President Sirisena because Mr. Rajapaksa is a former President and one of the patrons of the party at the moment. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa today said the country was like a piece of cake as everything was in order and in shape, when his Government handed it over to the new Government.
However, he said the Government had failed to gain benefits from the given opportunity. 
We put an end to the war, developed the country and increased foreign reserves before the Government took control of the country. It was handed over like a piece of cake and everything was in order. But once the Government took over, the economy collapsed rapidly, he said at a New Year function at his public relations office.
Mr. Rajapaksa said if the Government continued with development process without abruptly halting them, people would have benefitted well today.

TN has no role in Katchatheevu issue: Karuna accuses Jaya
	
Accusing Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa of misleading people on the issue of Katchatheevu, DMK chief M. Karunanidhi on Sunday has reminded her that any steps to retrieve the island ceded to Sri Lanka has to be taken by the Union Government and that the state governments have no role in the issue.
Mr. Karunanidhi has said the AIADMK chief is giving him opportunities to bring out the truth on several issues, the Deccan Chronicle reported.
He had said that the Chief Minister was misleading the people only with an eye on the elections.
Ms. Jayalalithaa has said several times that it is the Union Government which has to take steps to retrieve Katchatheevu islands from Sri Lanka and that the Chief Minister has no role in it. She had also said that if the Chief Minister had any role, the islet would have been retrieved long back, Mr. Karunanidhi said.
He said the Chief Minister has said that he was responsible for Katchatheevu being given to Sri Lanka.
Just before elections, she says she will retrieve Katchatheevu if she comes to back to power. This is just lie, the DMK chief said.
Addressing a public meeting on Friday, the Chief Minister had accused the DMK chief of being responsible for Katchatheevu being given to Sri Lanka.

Train delayed as guard waits for auspicious time
	
The Jaffna bound night mail train was delayed by 96 minutes last Wednesday (April 13) as the railway guard on duty had reported late for duty after performing the rituals at the auspicious time, Railways Department sources said.
The train which was scheduled to leave Colombo Fort at 9.30 pm had left at 11.06 .
A senior railway official said the train had to wait for this particular guard as the department was short of staff.
He said only 30% of the special train services scheduled for the New Year season could be operated as a large number of guards were on leave.
He said at times porters had to be deployed on guard duty due to the acute shortage of guards, in order to operate the trains. (Vinitha M. Gamage)

VAT a New Year gift: FSP
	
The increase in the Value Added Tax (VAT) to 15 percent with the effect from May 02 could be considered as an unpleasant New Year present given by the Government to the people, the Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) charged today.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo, FSP Propaganda Secretary Pubudu Jayagoda said the common people had fallen in to a great difficulty with the VAT increment.
He said the Government was to implement these increments within the Capitalist Class even though they had targeted common working people and small, medium scale businessman.
The maximum VAT increment level was up to 11 percent, but the Government has proposed to increase it up to 15 percent. As a result of this the prices of numerous essential items will go up, he added.
He also said that President Maithripala Sirisena had made a contradictory statement by saying that he would not let people suffer from such a VAT increment.
The President is unaware of everything unless the media announced it, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
