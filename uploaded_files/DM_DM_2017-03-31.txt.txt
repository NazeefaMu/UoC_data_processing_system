## Title: Colombo most suited to be commercial hub: Port City Official

Colombo most suited to be commercial hub: Port City Official
	
Colombo is the most suitable to be South Asias commercial hub, Chief Marketing Officer of the Colombo Port City project which is being executed by the China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC) has said.
According to Indian Express, Chief Marketing Officer Liang Thow Ming has told that Colombo is not only South Asias cleanest and the most livable city, it is also the capital of a country which has no quarrels with any of the nations in South Asia.
That makes Colombo an ideal place to create and run a regional commercial hub, he added.
People from all parts of South Asia can come to Sri Lanka and do business here without issues relating to their nationality, Liang pointed out, in a veiled reference to problems between India and Pakistan which hinder free movement of goods, services and people between the two countries.
In fact, from the general acceptability point of view, Colombo could be the Singapore of South Asia, Liang added.
A Singapore national of Chinese origin, Liang said that the Colombo Port city (now renamed Colombo Financial City) will be an international commercial and financial hub with its own legal system based on the British model and labor laws attuned to the needs of modern businesses. It will have investments from all parts of the world and not necessarily from China.
However, the Financial City will be primarily serving the Indian market which is the single largest in the total South Asian market of 1.7 billion people, Liang said.
Indians who want to park funds abroad could do it in the Colombo Financial City, rather than in Dubai or Mauritius, as Colombo is the nearest and also culturally compatible, he noted.
Asked about Indias opposition to the project on security grounds, especially after the visit of Chinese submarines in 2014, Liang said that India has since dropped its opposition because Indian businessmen and government officials have realized that the Port City is nothing but a commercial venture in which Indians are welcome to invest.
He said he has met Indian entrepreneurs and even addressed the association of top Indian real estate developers at their conference held in Shanghai. The delegates expressed an interest in knowing more about the project. Liang also met the former Indian Deputy External Affairs Minister Shashi Tharoor, an ardent advocate of India-China cooperation.
According to Liang, it would cost a company about US$ 200 million to invest in land, buildings and business in the Colombo Port City. There are about 1000 top Indian developers out of which 100 to 200 may be able to raise US$ 200 million, he estimated.
However, the question is whether it will be worthwhile for them to shift to Colombo from India or Dubai to Colombo, Liang said. According to the Chinese Ambassador in Sri Lanka, Yi Xianliang, four or five top Indian companies have expressed an interest in investing in the port city, but he would not name them.
Following the Presidential election in January 2015, in which president Mahinda Rajapaksa, who initiated the Port City project, was defeated, the new government stalled work on it for a few months to investigate some charges and also to negotiate the terms.
But after the modification of the terms, work is going full steam ahead, Liang said.

Compelled to take major TU action: GMOA
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today said it was reluctantly compelled to go in for a major trade union action next week as the government had failed to offer a reasonable solution to the SAITM issue.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that they had waited nearly two months by giving necessary time to the related authorities to arrive to a decision on the issue.
The GMOAs Executive Committee will announce an exact day on Monday for the trade union action, he said adding that they also wrote to President Maithripala Sirisena on the gravity of the issue.
He said the GMOA discussed the issue with the President at the special committee meeting which has been appointed by him to investigate the matter.
We did not receive any reasonable solution to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe during any of these instances. We always wanted to resolve this issue by protecting the patients lives during this battle, he said.
Meanwhile, GMOA Secretary Navin De Zoysa said that the GMOA was still waiting for the Presidents intervention on the matter, stressing that they were willing to go for further discussions on the issue if the government would offer them an opportunity. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

India could develop Colombo, Trinco, KKS ports: Arjuna
	
Though China is deeply rooted in Hambantota port, Sri Lanka has three other major ports in Colombo, Trincomalee and Kankesanthurai where India could collaborate for development, Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga has said.
According to Z News, Minister Ranatunga has said the government was looking at an Asian subcontinent investor to partner with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) to invest and take over the East Container Terminal (of Colombo port) in private-public partnership mode.
"India has shown interest in the East Terminal and Colombo port. Seventy-five per cent of the trans-shipment goes to India. India is looking at getting a stake in Colombo port. There are a couple of private companies that came and spoke, and we will look at them in a positive manner," he has told IANS on the sidelines of an international event held in Dakhla.
According to reports, the state-run Container Corporation of India (Concor) has formed a consortium with APM Terminals B V, John Keells Holdings and Maersk Line to bid for the development of East Container Terminal in Colombo. The total project value is likely to be about $550-600 million.
The South Terminal of the Colombo port is already owned and operated by state-run China Merchant Holdings (International).
Colombo Port is the busiest in Sri Lanka and ranks among the top 35 ports in the world.
Minister Ranatunga said that India is also "very keen" on Trincomalee Port. He said a Singaporean company, Subarna Jurong, is doing a feasibility report on developing the Trincomalee port city, while the Asian Development Bank is covering the port development project.
"India has shown big interest in Trincomalee, as there are petroleum tanks there, and the Indian Oil Corporation has been there for many years," he said.
Lanka IOC, a unit of the Indian Oil Corporation, maintains several oil tanks at the Trincomalee tank farm.
Ranatunga said the feasibility report would be submitted in three months, and the government would take a call after that.
"We shall be calling for tenders. The government will decide," he said, on the sidelines of the Crans Montana Forum on Africa and South-South Cooperation in Dakhla where he also presented a paper.
Asked if China would bid for Trincomalee, he said: "I think China is very much settled in Hambantota. China Merchant Group has a container terminal in Colombo and they are quite comfortable with Hambantota."
He said Sri Lanka is also looking to develop the Kankesanthurai port in the north. "It is quite close to India. It is not a container port, it will be more for transportation, for cement and people."

MS formed govt. with thieving lot: Lalkantha
	
Former JVP stalwart K.D. Lalkantha said yesterday that President Maithripala Sirisena formed a government with a cabinet with a thieving lot and acceded his presidential supremacy to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Mr. Lalkantha said though President Sirisena assumed office as the President, he was merely acting as a normal citizen having relinquished his powers to Mr. Wickremesinghe.
The President was appointed by the peoples votes and should help on their issues. Without doing so he is watching till the PM interferes and resolves the matters. To stay on the Presidency he should focus on the public matters and work towards finding solutions for them, he said.
Mr. Lalkantha expressed these views while addressing a media briefing organized by the National Trade Union Centre (NTUC) and vowing stern trade union action against the government, forcing to resolve the controversial South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) issue.
He said by pulling the SAITM issue now the situation has worsen and the deadline they have given to the government to find a better solution is expiring on April 3 and with the partnership of private and public unions they would seek stern trade union action against the matter.
He also said that without the doctors all the other medical services employees has commenced their support over the trade union action. However, he requested the support of the patients who is in the hospitals when their trade union action is on.
We would kneel down the government to shut down SAITM. We kindly request patients who are in the hospitals to support our strike and not to deny our struggle as it is for safe guard the countrys health service and to save the patients health, he said.
Further, Mr. Lalkantha said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has raised his voice against the SAITM with the intention of taking political advantage out of it. He said that his interference on the matter is because he doesnt have the power and might do the same thing President Sirisena doing now if the supreme power was in his hand.

Seneviratne appeals for change in ministerial portfolio
	
Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne yesterday said he would be pleased if he was given some other ministerial portfolio instead of labour, as he could perform better.
He said he had already made a request to President Maithripala Sirisena for a change in the ministerial portfolio.
I served as the Labour Minister for four long years, and was later given the same portfolio. Today, some of my ministerial subjects have been removed. Therefore, I would like to have a different portfolio to serve the country better, the minister told journalists following a workshop held in Wellawatte recently.
He said he had served as the minister of Health, Power and Energy, Justice and Public Administration in the past, and that he would be happy if he was given a ministry with such prominence.
Commenting on the alleged Cabinet reshuffle, the minister said he was aware of the news but no discussion had been made in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) or in the Cabinet on this matter so far.
However, Minister Seneviratne admitted that there were setbacks in the government as there were people's issues that needed to be addressed immediately. (Lahiru Pothmulla and Indika Sri Aravinda)

Special rapporteur to probe Zeids report: Sarath Weerasekara
	
Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekara MP, today rejected reports that he requested the UN General Assembly to assign a special rapporteur to probe war crime charges allegedly committed by the Sri Lankan armed forces.
He said he only requested for a special rapporteur to investigate the basis on which the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid al-Hussein compiled his report on Sri Lanka.
We want a rapporteur to probe Prince Zeid report and then ours. The reports we submitted have clearly mentioned that we have never committed war crimes. Therefore, its only reasonable that the UN report be probed and the resolution on Sri Lanka be suspended till the probe is completed, he told a news conference.
Mr. Weerasekara said they were against any form of hybrid courts to convict Sri Lankan forces, and that the proposed Office of Missing Persons (OMP) would be vested with powers to punish armed forces personnel.
He said the British Prime Minister has vowed to protect British troops from any legal abuse never allowing them to be victims of war crimes, but unfortunately, Sri Lanka lacks leaders of that calibre.
When British PM, Obama or Trump make a decision, it becomes the stance of the government. None of their foreign ministers contradict the government stance and express different opinions in Geneva or elsewhere.
However, in Sri Lanka, though the President and Prime Minister say there will be no participation of foreign judges in the local mechanism, the Foreign Minister contradicts this stance in Geneva, Mr. Weerasekera said.
He said several foreign ministers talked to him following the submission of the two reports to the UNHRC last week. They said they are not agreeing to anything at this level. However, they also said they now know that there is another side to the story, he said.
Mr. Weerasekara said they would increase their participation at the next UNHRC sessions in September and March to make the international community aware of the original version of the story. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The 8 most important features of Samsungs new Galaxy S8 phone
	

Samsung may still be trying to make up for its debilitating hardware nightmare, but it has one distinct advantage: its launching its new flagship phone, the Galaxy S8, early enough in the year that it gets to help establish a new standard for what a 2017 premium smartphone should be. One analyst even went as far as calling yesterdays S8 event the launch of the smartphone innovation Super Cycle. If you believe that to be true, then that means the features of the new phone are some of the most innovative and important ones to date.
Below are some of the key features of the Galaxy S8 phone that are likely to be the most talked-about, tested, and even copied over the next several months. We cant say for sure whether these are the best features of the phone, because we havent had the chance to use it for an extended time period. But these are definitely the ones that make it stand out. Your move, Apple.
Infinity Display
The Galaxy S8 has a 5.8-inch display crammed into what feels like a normal-sized phone, with a barely-there bezel. That alone is a feat of engineering, but the phone is also a thing of beauty to look at. It has a clean, unbranded face; a bright, fluid-looking display; and a mirror-like glass back. So far, the one bad thing weve noted about the display is its bizarre aspect ratio, which might result in pillarboxed 16:9 videos. Otherwise, Samsung has pulled off an optical magic trick. By the way, if you still want an actual phablet: theres a version with a 6.2-inch display, too.
Force Touch
Okay, Samsung isnt calling it Force Touch; thats Apples jam. But this new Galaxy S8 phone does incorporate a similar mechanism into the bottom half of it, which means that when you press on the (now entirely virtual) home button, it gives haptic feedback in response. Also! This phone doesnt have a physical home button. It does have a fingerprint scanner, as well as face-scanning capabilities, which Ill get to. The fingerprint scanner is now on the back of the phone, right next to the camera lens. Its too soon to tell whether this placement is ill-advised.Better Selfie Camera
Samsung was uncharacteristically... subdued when it came to the Galaxy S8s photo-snapping capabilities, but that might be because the biggest change was made to the front-facing camera, not the rear camera. The selfie camera now captures 8-megapixel photos with an f/1.7 lens, and also has autofocus capabilities. In our brief tests of the front-facing camera, autofocus worked well and fast. Selfie lovers, you are welcome.
"The face unlock feature is fast  so fast that maybe you should be worried"
Fast Face Scanning
Authentication through facial recognition has been a feature on Android phones and laptops for years now, but this is the first implementation made by Samsung itself. And, according to The Verges Dieter Bohn, who tested it during his brief hands-on with the S8: its fast. (So blink-of-an-eye quick, in fact, that he had to do multiple takes to try to show it on video.) The obvious upside: considering that the fingerprint sensor has been moved to the back, this kind of face-scanning tech could easily become the default mechanism for unlocking your phone. The downside: in the age of eroding privacy regulations and random airport searches, do you really want your phone to unlock that easilyBixby
Its 2017, and Samsung has finally introduced its own virtual assistant: Bixby. Samsung is positioning it as a virtual assistant thats largely focused on helping you get stuff done on the phone itself: you can set reminders, search through photo galleries, and cast your phone screen to your Wi-Fi-connected TV, all by pressing a dedicated Bixby button and talking to it. Its also able to identify physical objects out in the wild (well, some of them at least). Less clear is how helpful Bixby will be at pulling in information from the web. The big question, then, is whether Bixby will simply play nice with the Google Assistant thats already running on Android phones, or whether this is going to turn into a death match at the expense of your access to helpful information.
"How will Bixby differentiate itself from Google Assistant"
DeX
Using only your phone to power an entire desktop experience has long been the dream of business people who at some point in their lives had to carry big boxy ThinkPads around, but most attempts at that so far have been iffy. Thats where Samsungs DeX comes in, short for Desktop Experience. DeX is a plastic bowl-like stand with a USB-C prong, a couple of ports, and a fan. It supports the Galaxy S8 and effectively gives you a PC-like mobile desktop on a display. Some apps are even optimized for the experience; although, the only browser it runs right now is Samsungs own Internet browser. Is this the Road Warrior dream finally realized Well see, but at first glance, it looked cool.

3.5mm Headphone Jack
Im not being hyperbolic when I say that the lack of 3.5mm headphone jack is still one of the only reasons I havent upgraded to another phone. So I appreciate that a manufacturer like Samsung can try to move the needle forward in all kinds of ways (No more bezels! Face scanning! Bye, home button!), and yet still keep that little hole in the bottom of its phone. Okay, arguably, the fact that the phone supports Bluetooth 5 is more notable. But in my humble opinion, the 3.5mm headphone jack is still one of the most welcome features of the Galaxy S8. Well, that and...
A Non-Exploding Battery (We Hope)
Its the elephant in the room: can Samsung recover from the Note 7 Samsung says it has learned from its fiery phone saga, and that it has implemented an eight-step battery-check process. And for what its worth, the S8 it appears to have taken a more conservative approach, based on milliamps alone. This is another one of those things we cant fully assess until weve used the phone for a good period of time, but if it just performs like its supposed to and doesnt burst into flames, then its a win for Samsung. And if it doesnt Nothing short of catastrophic for the company.
