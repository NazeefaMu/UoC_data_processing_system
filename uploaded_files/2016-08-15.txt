Allegation on poisoning ex-LTTErs: Gammanpila wants Wickramabahu arrested
	
Nava Sama Samaja Party General Secretary Dr. Wickramabahu Karunaratne should be arrested for making false allegations on Sri Lankan tri-forces that ex-LTTE cadres in detention had been allegedly injected with poisonous drugs, if he did not have evidence to prove the allegations, Opposition MP Udaya Gammanpila said today.
While denying Dr. Karunaratne?s claim, MP Gammanpila said no mysterious deaths of ex-LTTE cadres reported due to alleged poisoning when they were undergoing post-war rehabilitation in army camps.
He told a media briefing yesterday that nearly 13, 000 ex-LTTErs surrendered to the Army, without opting to commit suicide, by biting into a cyanide pill, because they had trust on the Sri Lankan Army.
?Ex-terrorists were provided with vocational training, English and ICT education and finally handed over them to the relatives after rehabilitation. Everything was done within two years . No country in the world treats ex-terrorists in such a manner,? MP Gammanpila said.
He said that Dr. Wickramabahu Karunaratne should have evidence before making such serious allegations against the tri-forces.
He said the allegation would be used to level war crimes charges on Sri Lankan tri-forces, by those who need to defame the good name of them.
Dr. Karunaratne had been injected with a toxic drug called ?Tamil separatism? by western countries, he alleged. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Fitch affirms HDFC Bank at ?BBB(lka)?; outlook stable
	
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Housing Development Finance Corporation Bank of Sri Lanka (HDFC Bank) national long-term rating at ?BBB(lka)?. The outlook?
is stable.?
The agency also affirmed HDFC Bank?s senior secured and senior unsecured debentures at ?BBB(lka)?.
HDFC Bank?s National Long-Term Rating reflects Fitch?s expectation that the bank would receive extraordinary support from the Sri Lanka sovereign, if required. The sovereign?s limited ability to provide support is reflected in Sri Lanka?s ?B+?/Negative rating. Fitch believes the sovereign?s propensity to extend support to the bank stems from the state?s 51 percent effective holding and HDFC Bank?s quasi-policy role in supporting the state housing-development initiatives.?
However, Fitch sees potential for state support for HDFC Bank as being much lower than for the country?s larger state-owned banks, due to its lower systemic importance.
The stable outlook on the bank?s national long-term rating reflects its creditworthiness relative to the best credit in Sri Lanka.
Housing loans accounted for 87 percent of HDFC Bank?s loan-book at end-1Q16. The bank is authorised to provide housing loans to members of the Employees? Provident Fund (EPF), Sri Lanka?s retirement savings scheme.?
The loans are secured against members? EPF balances and accounted for 29 percent of the bank?s total?
loans in 1Q16.?
NPLs on these loans are much higher than for the rest of the bank?s portfolio, but the Central Bank of Sri Lanka annually reimburses HDFC Bank for EPF-backed loans in arrears for?
over three months.
However, the bank?s reported gross NPL ratio remains high even after excluding EPF-backed housing loan NPLs, at 8.4 percent at end-1Q16 (19.7 percent including EPF-backed loans). This is mainly due to its exposure to low- and middle-income customer segments.
Fitch sees HDFC Bank?s capitalisation as weak and believe that the bank relies on capital infusion from the state, as its internal capital generation may not be sufficient to meet the minimum capital requirement of Rs.5 billion by 1 January 2018. The bank?s outstanding debentures are rated in line with its national long-term rating and rank equally with the claims of other senior unsecured creditors.?
Fitch has not provided any rating uplift for the collateralisation on the senior secured debentures as their recovery prospects are considered to be average and comparable with those of the unsecured notes in a developing?
legal system.

Business magnate Dhammika Perera-controlled licensed finance company, LB Finance PLC, made a June quarter (1Q17) net profit of Rs.911.7 million or Rs.6.58 a share up 18 percent from a year ago, supported by growth in its loans and leases albeit at a slower pace and inherently high margins.?

Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa and Sudarshana Bandara who were arrested by the FCID yesterday over the inquiry conducted under the Money Laundering Act for purchasing Rs. 100 million worth shares of a company called Hello Corp from alleged ill-gotten funds by Gowers Corporation which is headed by Mr. Rajapaksa, was remanded till August 22 by Colombo Additional Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
Producing the suspects in court, the prosecution filing two separate B reports informed court about the two suspicious Rs. 15 million and Rs. 30 million transactions on the instructions of the Attorney General.
According to the FCID, the suspect Namal Rajapaksa had dealt with a company called 'Boston Capital' and given Rs. 15 million by himself and another Rs. 30 million through one Indika Karunajeewa to the chairman of that company, Mr. Rohan Abey Iriyagolla, in order to conceal the origin of the alleged ill gotten funds.
The prosecution alleged that according to the statements got from the chairman of the Boston Company, the given money was paid to Gowers Corporation and NR Consultancy Companies again, which are headed by Namal Rajapaksa, under the disguise of payments for the services obtained by the Boston Company.
The two transactions were found by the prosecution as offences that fell under the Money Laundering Act.
The other suspects, Indika Prabath Karunajeewa, Pavithra Sujani Bogollagama, Nithya Senani Samaranayake, Sudarsha Bandara Ganegoda and Iresha Silva were earlier named as suspects by the FCID over conspiring to commit the offences that fell under the Money Laundering and Penal Code.
The prosecution held that it had initiated a broad investigation to apprehend the most wanted suspect, Indika Karunajeewa, who resides abroad by absconding the prosecution.
They also said that the main witness of the inquiry Bangladesh national, Abdul Al Saman was also missing since the investigation started.
The FCID requested court to remand the suspects on the possibility of some of the witnesses being affected by the suspects.
The defence counsel filing a bail application moved that the suspects would not interfere with the witnesses or the investigation.
They also questioned the integrity of the witness Iriyagolla, who is the owner of the Boston Capital, comparing the contradictory statements given by him to the FCID.
Considering the prosecution request over the possible interference with the witnesses by the suspects, the Magistrate remanded the suspects and directed the police to expedite the investigation.(Shehan Chamika Silva)

NDB June net dented by higher impairments, narrowing margins
	
National Development Bank PLC group?s net profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 (2Q16) fell by 6.8 percent to Rs. 535.4 million or Rs.3.24 a share from a year ago as the performance was hurt by provisions made for possible bad loans, fall in income from the investments and narrowing margins in the rising interest rate environment. ?
The fee and commission-based incomes too fell, the interim results showed. The bank share ended 20 cents or 0.12 percent lower at Rs.164.80 at last week?s trading close.?
The loans of the bank on a standalone basis grew by just over 5 percent or Rs.10.9 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2016 (1H16), ?amidst stiff competition?, the bank said in a statement.?
The growth in the loans has mainly driven by the overdrafts which have risen by Rs.7 billion and the home loans too grew by another Rs.900 million. ??
The bank had a loan book of Rs.225.9 billion and an asset base of Rs.314.3 billion, up just 2 percent during the 1H16. ?
The growth in deposits has been fairly weak compared to the growth in loans as the portfolio recorded a growth of only 3.2 percent or Rs.5.9 billion. The bank has a deposit base of Rs.190.8 billion.?
However, the bank?s low cost, current and savings accounts (CASA) base fell to 23.9 percent from 25.6 percent in December 2015, weighing on the funding cost and thereby taking toll on the margins.
NDB started raising customer deposits 10 years ago. ?
The net interest margin slipped to 2.61 percent from 2.63 percent six months ago demonstrating faster pace of re-pricing deposits over the loan book.?
The net interest income however rose by 19.2 percent year-on-year (yoy) to Rs.2.2 billion but the rise in interest expenses outweighed the corresponding rise in interest income.?
Net fee and commission income also narrowed by 6.3 percent yoy to Rs.738.1 million. Even the 1H16 growth has been a little 2 percent yoy to Rs. 1.5 billion.?
The Director and Chief Executive Officer at NDB, Rajendra Theagarajah at the beginning of the year said fee income is a key lever and would closely monitor the bank?s ?fees-to-net income? ratio as key performance indicator. ?
Meanwhile, the bank?s trading investment portfolio has made a gain of Rs.268.7 million against Rs.259. 9 million in the corresponding period last year. These investments mainly consist of government securities, equity investments and any other short term investments but are held for?
trading purpose.?
However, the bank?s income from similar financial investments categorized under available for sale fell to Rs.57.6 million from Rs.141. 9 million a year ago due to, ?upward movement in market interest rates?. ?
Other operating income of the bank which captures the revaluation gains and losses of its foreign exchange portfolio increased the loss to Rs.57.4 million from Rs.14.3 million.?
Impairments ? provisions made for possible bad loans ? continued to trouble the bank?s profits as both specific provisions and general provisions rose 18.4 percent yoy to Rs.332. 9 million. ?
The gross non-performing loans slightly up from 2.43 percent to 2.54 percent but stayed below industry average. ?
Bank?s Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratios were marginally down at 8.50 percent and 12.51 percent, respectively, but remained above the regulatory minimum of 5 percent and 10 percent, respectively.?
However, the bank?s Chairman N.G. Wickremeratne said fresh capital would be infused in the near future to support further expansion in loan growth but did not give a timeline.?
The Central Bank does not want to see private credit growth above 20 percent in 2016. ?
Meanwhile, the banking group?s shareholder list also saw some notable changes during the quarter with the high net-worth individual, R.S. Captain increasing his stake to 8.16 percent being the third largest shareholder from 3.88 percent held in March 2016.
Further, CIC Holdings PLC also featured among the top twenty shareholders with a 1.49 percent stake being the sixteenth largest shareholder. ?
As of June 30, 2016, the government along with its parties held 30.01 percent stake in the bank while the state-controlled private sector pension fund, the Employees? Provident Fund held 9.69 percent stake being the second largest shareholder.?
Bank of Ceylon topped the list with a 9.91 percent stake.?
Meanwhile for the 1H16 the banking group made a net profit of Rs.1.08 billion or Rs.6.56 a share, down 25 percent yoy.?

OMP findings can be used as evidence: GL
	
Though the government had assured that the findings of the Office of the Missing Persons (OMP) would not give rise to civil or criminal liability, the joint opposition said today the findings could be used as evidence when the judicial mechanism is set up to hear accountability issues.
Former MP G.L. Peiris said the hidden purpose of the OMP was to collect evidence to be submitted in the proposed accountability court and pointed out that the OMP would perform as an all-powerful entity once established.
He said the setting up of the OMP was not the final step but the first in a line of events which would follow. ?The Truth Seeking Commission and the Special Accountability Court are the next steps of the OMP, also a result of the international pressure. It is not a product of domestically generated move,? Mr. Peiris said.
He said there were a number of statements which were detrimental to the country in the OMP Bill and said the President could still get rid of these clauses if he was prepared to do so.
?All entities at National and Provincial levels are bound to fulfil requirements of the OMP. If anyone failed or refused to provide the necessary documents or details to its officials, the OMP could go to the Appeal Court against them on charges of contempt of court. No matter what they have done, no action could be taken against OMP officials because they are immune to the law of the country. These are very serious matters and that is why we are against the OMP Bill,? Mr. Peiris said.
He criticized the prominence given to the missing persons in the North and East through the Bill and said investigations into all missing persons should be conducted in a fair manner despite their origin.
"The permission given to the OMP to accept funds and resources from any foreign country or an NGO, to come into any agreement with any factions, appoint any officials be it Sri Lankan or foreign to the OMP and vesting them with unlimited authority were also detrimental to the country," Mr. Peiris said. ?The amendments which were made to accept foreign funds though the Department of External Resources of the Treasury and to inform the IGP within 48 hours after a person was questioned are of no use.?
He said the OMP has the authority not to disclose the details of a person who was reported as missing but found abroad afterwards. ?Why all this secrecy? We aren?t against finding the fate of the missing but it should be carried out in a manner which is not detrimental to the country. The President asked what the shortcomings of the Bill were and now we have enumerated them. We request him to pay his attention to these issues to save the country,? Mr. Peiris said.

US hails investment friendly environment in Sri Lanka
	
The United State hailed on Friday what it termed as the investment friendly environment has currently been created in Sri Lanka. The US Assistant Secretary for Economic and Business Affairs, Charles H Rivkin said during his meeting with Minister of Finance Ravi Karunanayake at the Finance Ministry on Saturday.
The visiting State Secretary who praised the current economic programme of Sri Lanka said there is a friendly environment created for investment in the country. He stressed that he will take necessary steps to encourage top level US businessmen to invest in Sri Lanka. The economic changes that have been introduced after the new government was voted to power will serve as a positive entry point for the island to face the challenges emerging before the country, visiting US State Secretary Charles H. Rivkin said.
The approach of the government is to find solution to the huge debt trap through attracting more and more foreign investment rather than putting the burden on the people, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said. As a result of the strategies introduced by the government to attract foreign investors to the country since it was voted to power last year, many foreign countries have shown their interest to invest in Sri Lanka,
He further stated that the discussion between the visiting US State Secretary for Economic and Business Affairs also took place as a result of the good governance economic strategies. The investment opportunities will be expanded further with the agreements to be signed between Sri Lanka and international investment groups in the future. More and more employment opportunities are expected to be created once such investors start operation in the country, Minister Karunanayake said optimistically. He further said that under such vibrant economic environment, including the growth of export, the economic development platform of Sri Lanka would be secured in the future.

We will ask the OMP to probe Wijeweera's abduction and death: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today said it would request the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) to investigate the abduction and killing of party's founder leader Rohana Wijeweera, senior member Upatissa Gamanayake and the mass grave in Matale.
JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake told a media briefing that his party would make the request even though the OMP might not live up to expectations.
?Our founder leader was abducted and was ordered to make a public statement on television. Later it was reported that he was killed. But no one knows where he was buried. The situation is same when it comes to Gamanayake,? the MP said.
He made some serious charges with regard to the investigations on the mass grave in Matale and pointed out that the remains of those who were buried in this grave had been tampered with. ?Tampering has been done when the remains, on a court order, were sent abroad for further investigations,? he said."We are not sure whether OMP will mete out justice to the relatives of the missing persons."
He highlighted the fact that the government had failed to look into the issue of disappearances in a broad manner with the truth and reconciliation commission, and the commission against discrimination as proposed by his party set up together with the office of missing persons so as to prevent any disappearances and extra judicial killings in the future. ?The government should have given priority to the truth and reconciliation commission and the commission against discrimination rather than the setting up of the OMP,? Mr Ratnayake said.
He said the OMP might well end up like the commissions in Argentina, Guatemala, and Chile which were failures. (Yohan Perera)
