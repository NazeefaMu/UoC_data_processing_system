Essential tests for Dengue within 30 minutes: SMLS
	
Following a request made by the President Maithripala Sirisena during a discussion held on Saturday (17) Laboratory Officers have initiated a programme where most essential tests for dengue patients such as Full Blood Count (FBC), Dengue Antigen or Antibody tests will be carried out within a very short period of time in order to make sure that the ever increasing number of dengue patients get treated on time. This programme will come into effect from Wednesday (21) a statement issued by the Sri Lanka Society for Medical Laboratory Science (SMLS) today said.
SLMS President Ravi Kumudesh said the recent dengue outbreak differs from what they experienced previously as the dengue mosquito Aedes aegypti characteristic adjustments has changed the symptoms of disease.
He said previously FBC test was performed after 3 days where they mainly check the platelet count of the patient as the platelets gradually decrease, however, during the recent outbreak in most cases Laboratory Officers identified the platelet count descends rapidly within two days.
It has become a huge burden to the hospitals to treat these Dengue patients with the limited facilities available. Following the President's intervention we decided to establish a separate laboratory in each hospital located in areas where the dengue epidemic exists, he said.
Further he said the Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) and the Negombo District General Hospital had been inundated with dengue patients. These hospitals are overcrowded already. In these hospitals there are more dengue patients than hospital beds. So it is clearly an epidemic situation in those areas. So far we dont have the necessary personnel and equipment to face this grave situation. However we will carry out our task continuously until the situation improves, he said.
According to the programme Mr. Kumudesh said the patient would be sent for a FBC test before he was channelled to a doctor - making it that much easier for the doctor to determine whether that particular patient should be admitted to a hospital or not. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Sarath rejects Special Rapporteur allegations
	
The UNHRC Special Rapporteur Ms. Monica Pintos allegations following her visit to Sri Lanka in 2016 that SL Judiciary was highly politicised and judges give verdicts favouring the Government was a derogatory and contemptuous statement made towards the Judiciary with a proud history of 200 years, retired Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekara said.
Addressing United Nations side event held in Geneva Thursday (15) Mr. Weerasekara questioned the ability of Ms Pinto to read, study and analyse.
He asked how she came to the conclusion that Sri Lankan judges were incompetent, incapable, poorly selected, corrupt, cowardly and partial within just eight days.
It is very obvious that all these were pre-conceived /pre-determined observations, influenced by separatist elements to justify foreign judges, lawyers and prosecutors in special courts in Sri Lanka to try our soldiers who defeated the terrorists trying to separate the North from the country, he said.
He also said that before coming to a conclusion that Sri Lankan judges were not capable enough to handle systemic crimes, the UNHRC should go through the achievements of the judges who work for the Judiciary in foreign countries.
Further, he also turned down the charges made by OISL Report of Zeid Al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of UNHRC that Sri Lankan forces committed genocide, indiscriminate shelling, and preventing aid to Tamil areas. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

A dedicated TV Channel would be launched to telecast Parliamentary proceedings, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said yesterday.
He said steps would be taken to telecast proceedings of all Parliamentary Committees such as COPE and COPA in the future.
Mr. Jayasuriya said journalists would be allowed to cover committee meetings to ensure democracy in the country.
He said even though the COPE and COPA had revealed fraud, corruption and misuse of State resources by Government institutions through their reports, they were not given proper publicity so that people could know about it.
"I regret that we have not used the reports of such committees revealing the fraud and corruption for any good. We hope to debate on such reports in the future. Today we have given the chairmanship of the COPE to the opposition to ensure its impartiality," he said.
He said they had introduced a mobile app so that people could access Parliament proceedings in all three languages from anywhere in the world. (Ajith Siriwardana)
