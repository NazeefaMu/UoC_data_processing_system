Public requested to switch to CFL and LED bulbs to save energy
	
The CEB was considering to remove the use of incandescent bulbs in a move to save energy and introduce CFL and LED bulbs, Power and Renewable Energy Ministry Secretary Suren Batagoda said yesterday.
He explained that incandescent bulbs wasted around 95 per cent of electricity that was supplied.
The CEB had requested consumers to replace any incandescent bulbs used by them with energy saving CFL and LED bulbs in order to save energy.
About 20 percent of the population still uses incandescent bulbs which they have got used to. A majority of the people however is conscious of the environmental and energy costs and have already shifted to CFL and LED bulbs, he noted.
Mr. Batagoda requested the people to stop using those incandescent bulbs at least for the next three months and to support the CEB to manage the electricity supply while the drought continues.
The CEB is hoping to buy one million LED and CFL bulbs and to distribute them free of charge to the people.
He also advised urban councils (UC) to switch on street lamps half an hour later than the usual time of illumination which is 6 pm in a bid to save electricity due to the prevailing drought.
Meanwhile it was announced that President Maithripala Sirisena had instructed the CEB not to cut power even if the drought continues and water levels reduce to dangerous levels, Mr. Batagoda said.
He said they had made arrangements to purchase electricity from private suppliers in order to meet the additional power requirements of the country.
Addressing the media at the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, Power and Renewable Energy Ministry Secretary Suren Batagoda noted yesterday that electricity was being wasted as a result of street lamps being turned on earlier that necessary in many areas of the country.
He therefore requested urban councils to switch on street lamps only at 6.30 p.m and to ensure that they are switched off by 5.30 the following morning. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Colombo Additional Magistrate Jeyaram Trotsky yesterday allowed the prosecution to send the CCTV footage relating to the suspicious vehicle that chased Thajudeen's vehicle on the day he was found dead, to the Colombo University for further examination.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake informed court the prosecution was in need of getting more clarified details about the unidentified vehicle that had chased Wasim Thajudeen's vehicle.
The Prosecution also said the DNA test report on the recovered 19 femur bone pieces and seven bone pieces of the chest area at the SAITM laboratory by the CID was still pending.
Earlier, the CID and a team of experts searched the SAITM Laboratory based on information revealed during the investigation that the former JMO Ananda Samaraseka had dispatched few body parts of Wasim Thajudeen to the SAITM.
Then the recovered body parts were sent to the 'Genetech' to conduct a DNA test using DNAs of Thajudeen's mother.

The Ambassador  who promotes  peace and unity  through culture
	


Internationally renowned musician and SAARC Cultural Centres first Deputy Director (Programme), Soundarie David Rodrigo believes culture is an important soft diplomacy tool that could be used to bring nations together. Soundarie, the newly-appointed Director Programmes of Colombo Cultural Hub -- a trust set-up to promote Sri Lanka as a cultural hub for South Asia -- is of the view that culture could be used to heal the wounds of a countrys history, the urgent and important need of the hour for Sri Lanka.
At a time when the achievements of SAARC have been marred by internal political changes and bilateral issues of its members and even some of the SAARC regional centres have been closed down over the recent years due to underperformance, the SCC with a comprehensive and busy programme schedule of arts and culture was able to become the best regional centre of SAARC in 2014. Following is an interview with Soundarie who believes that internal political decisions have impacted a lot on the SAARC mechanism.

QWhat is SAARC Cultural Centre How did it come into being 
The decision to establish a regional centre under the SAARC umbrella has been in discussion since the 2008 heads of state summit held in Colombo. As Sri Lanka never had such a centre until then, the SAARC Cultural Centre (SCC) came into being in 2010  it was the eleventh regional centre of SAARC. Here, I should mention a few people who were instrumental in establishing the centre; they were former Ambassador and one of the Former Secretaries General of SAARC Ambassador Nihal Rodrigo.
The main idea of the SCC is to promote regional cooperation through culture, and also to bring the people of South Asia closer to project the distinct South Asian identity.
The SCC was intended to function as a major meeting point for academics, the artistic communities and policy makers in the field of culture. Briefly, SCC is expected to operate as SAARCs public diplomacy wing.
QWhen you look at SCCs past, its website brings about a vivid presentation of activities spearheaded since its inception and until 2016. The centre has been culturally active. What are your thoughts
Yes. For any organisation, its leadership matters the most. In this regard, I would like to mention that it was under the leadership of Founder Director Mr. G.L.W. Samarasinghe that all this became possible. Why I say so is because by 2012, the centre was able to emerge as the best regional centre under his direction. All the successful programmes, in both research and performing arts, became a resounding success due to his able leadership. Another distinct characteristic of Mr. Samarasinghe was that he chose the best of the best, in terms of qualifications, work experience and most of all the ability to conceptualise and implement programmes. To work for the SCC and become the best centre within a very short stint didnt remain a mere dream. It became a reality quite naturally.
And the untiring support extended by the Foreign Affairs Ministry further bolstered the centre in its successful years. Mrs. Damayanthi Rajapakse, Mr. Prasanna Gamage and Mr. Y.K.A. Rohanajith from the SAARC division of the Foreign Ministry were also part of the centres success story.
QWhat are the achievements of the SCC Do you think the mandate of the centre has been achieved through its establishment
Since SCCs establishment in 2010, the centre has become quite a busy hub of cultural activities. We had two main divisions (research and programme), and I was heading the programme division while Dr. Sanjay Garg from India was heading the research. We were working and implementing many programmes, back to back, at least one per month.
SAARC film, cultural and drumming festivals, artists camps, annual research conferences, seminars, workshops, publications of annual poetry and short story collections, annual research journals, monographs and research reports -- this condensed but comprehensive list certainly gives you an insight into what the SCC has contributed to its mandate as well as to its people. If you visit the website of SCC, detailed information on all these programmes could be accessed. This was during the period from 2010 right up to mid 2016.
QAs the first Deputy Director (Programme) of the SCC, how do you assess your own contribution to the progress of the centre
Though music is my major passion, I also wanted to pursue a career in law of course to complement my artistic interests, hence choosing entertainment law for my LLM.
I was a recipient of the Rotary World Peace Scholarship, and had the honour of completing my Masters at the Berkeley University in California. Prior to this, I was working under the then UN Special Rapporteur for Violence Against Women Dr. Radhika Coomaraswamy who was also heading the International Centre for Ethnic Studies.
I worked under her guidance as a researcher. I looked into issues such as constitutionalism and human rights, and was able to learn a lot during this time period. I also did my apprenticeship under Senior Lawyer Dinal Phillips and managed to focus on Intellectual Property Law which eventually turned out to be my area of expertise.
The times at UC Berkeley was very special as I was able to work with the best in the field of Entertainment Law, and this also included work experience at Warner Brother Studios and with other well-known entertainment lawyers. After completing my LLM, I started working for the law firm Varners prior to joining the SCC as its first Deputy Director to head the programme division. I was blessed to have the guidance of Director Samarasinghe and the able assistance of my Programme Officer from Bhutan Mr. Karma Wangchuk. Both my colleague from India Dr. Sanjay Garg (the then Deputy Director Research) and I were able to implement all programmes during that time, and the centre ensured that funds of the governments were made good use of by bringing together the nations of the SAARC countries through culture. Therefore, it was tough work for the entire SCC team to keep up to our own policy of not cancelling any of the programmes streamlined in our calendar of events.
Music always has and will continue to be a major part of my life, but having completed my extended term of 6  years at the SCC, I am now moving on to something that I hope will help showcase Sri Lanka to the rest of the world. More on it will be up soon for the public. Having gathered a wealth of experience and knowledge from my experience at SAARC, focus on culture and entertainment law and also being on the World Choir council, I am confident that Sri Lanka will be on the world map for its rich cultural heritage, talent and beauty.
Culture is an important soft diplomacy tool that could be used to bind nations together. It could also be used to heal the wounds of a countrys history, and I consider this to be the need of the hour for Sri Lanka.
QThe achievements of SAARC have always been marred by internal political changes and bilateral issues of its member states. Do you think this had any impact on the achievements/ sustenance of the SCC in Colombo
Everything is at some point political. And yes, I strongly believe that internal political decisions and bilateral issues between member states have impacted a lot on the SAARC mechanism.
For instance, the heads of state meeting scheduled to be held in Pakistan got cancelled due to obvious tensions. Similarly, internal political changes have also had a great impact on certain regional centres.
As you might be already aware, some of the SAARC regional centres have been closed down during the last years due to under-performance -- this is largely due to the internal changes that occur within the countries. So, against this backdrop, internal politics can have a greater say in deciding the future of SAARC and its regional centres.

## Title: To whom do hospital beds really belong

To whom do hospital beds really belong
	

When a patient enters into one of our government hospitals their first question would be, will I get a bed The demand for medical facilities is such that the term floor patients has become a common term, even outside the world of medical jargon. Where there is overcrowding, there are distressed patients. Therefore, patients who are in need of beds are greatly inconvenienced and stressed, further contributing to the worsening of their medical condition and mental state. It effects the dignity of the patient as well. Over-crowded wards have many consequences: patient safety, as falls from beds, mixing up of patients blood reports with other tests and loss of medical records. Overcrowding can also lead to anger and frustration among both patients and staff leading to aggressive behaviour and even physical confrontations. This also affects the efficient running of a ward, as doctors, nurses and other medical staff are over worked. They find it difficult to organize themselves to deliver care more efficiently. Many would consider that the lack of hospital beds would mean that the demand of beds does not correspond with the supply of hospital beds. Though this is true to some extent, the key reason for the lack of beds is because of the inefficient use of existing resources. There are other factors contributing to this predicament as well, such as the absence of referral systems in hospitals, unnecessary admissions, and lack of physical resources and in some cases preferential treatment. 
The Daily mirror investigated on this matter further and detected the reasons and possible solutions to the issue of the lack of beds in state funded hospitals. 

Efficient use of existing resources
Dr Amitha Fernando, spoke specifically in regards to the resource allocation of existing facilities in hospitals, The demand at a particular time is such that resources are overwhelmed, patients have to, in some instances, spend the night on benches, share beds or sleep on mats on the floor. 
The question is whether there is real overcrowding, or whether hospitals are using their existing resources efficiently. For example if there are 1000 beds in the hospital, in most instances it is highly unlikely that all beds would be occupied at the same time. There are instances where some wards are busy while some wards are not, and at times these idle wards may be even closed because consultants work on a roster system. These closed wards have extra empty beds; however there is no one to allocate patients who are in dire need of beds, to those beds. 
He added, It is sad to see that there is no access to available beds on the off days of doctors. We need to truly ask the question: who owns the beds in government hospitals The public  Or is it the temporary custodian of the ward We need to change the mentality of consultants who are rather territorial in regards to their wards. They need to understand that the beds belong to the patients. They should help allocate government resources efficiently as they are accountable to the people. The consequence of this restriction to beds is: floor patients and sick children, and even adults in some circumstances, sharing beds. 
He spoke on other problems that should be addressed in addition to efficient resource allocation, There are also other issues such as unnecessary admission of patients and where most patient by-pass their local village hospitals and admit themselves to the bigger central hospitals for minor ailments. Though these are reasons for lack of beds in hospitals, the key reason is the inefficient allocation of existing resources. Remedying the main problem, should be the primary focus of all hospitals.


Preferential treatment
GMOA (Government Medical Officers Association), Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge, spoke on how the difficulties in managing the units of the OPD (Out Patient Department - It is the section of the hospital where patients are provided medical consultations) and preferential treatment are contributing factors to the lack of beds in government hospitals. He said, The government sectors are always overcrowded with patients. The priorities for beds go for the critically ill patients. However, through various means of the media it can be observed that some patients would be put on top of the priority list, if they have the influence of a doctor. This should not be so, everybody must be treated equally. But for equal treatment facilities must be provided. 
When we take the OPD unit for instance, the normal practice in other countries is that the doctor examines the patient for 5-10 minutes. However, in Sri Lanka though the salaries of doctors in the government sector are extremely subsidized, the doctor examines the patient for around 4 hours in the OPD. This requires a bed for the patient, and thus creates overcrowding. State doctors also see more than 100-150 patients daily. This is not practical. Since we do not have enough qualified doctors and we lack in facilities for the ever growing number of patients, the lack of beds in hospitals is an inevitable problem. 
He said as a solution to this issue, There should be HR development in our country, to increase the number of doctors and nurses in hospitals, and the government should allocate enough funds for there to be facilities in hospitals. 
However, the Media Spokesperson representing the GMOA Dr. Naveen De Zoysa has a different perspective on the preferential treatment in hospitals. He said, This does not happen, doctors already have so much on their plate. They have no time to make favourations towards patients. If a patient is critically ill a bed is provided immediately. There have never been cases of patients who are critically ill on the floor. We prioritize according to the illness. 

Government Aid
Dr. Naveen, spoke on the governments perspective with regard to this predicament, We need to conduct a need assessment to actually see the shortage of beds, to the demand of patients. But what we need to truly focus on is not the supposed lack of beds in hospitals, but the quality of service that the doctors provide to the patients. The main stakeholder in this situation is the government; it is their duty to provide all facilities to cater to the need of the public. The GMOA was particularly against the budget proposals, because the budget for health services had been reduced in contrast to last year. Ravi Karunayake even stated that he wanted to introduce a health insurance scheme. This is a detriment to the public because the private sector will be getting involved in our fully free, state service of health. Other countries look at our state health service as a model for theirs. Instead of reducing the budget of the costs of the health sector, the government must prioritise on improving it. We need to look at the lack of beds issue as a whole. The government needs to allocate more money for this problem to be eradicated. 
We asked if the GMOA, has made any claims to the government to increase the bed facility in hospitals, We do not only demand beds, we demand all facilities. We work very hard in doing so.


Unnecessary admissions
Dr. Bimsara Senanayake, Consultant Neurologist of the National Hospital, spoke on how the absence of a referral system leads to overcrowding in hospitals. A referral can be defined as a process where a health worker at one level of the health system, will refer the patient to a differently resourced facility, due to insufficient resources. But, we do not have a system where General Practitioners refer patients to government hospitals, by informing the hospital about the patient. 
He said, In government hospitals the OPD in some instances admits patients who need not be admitted. These patients who are wrongly admitted have minor ailments and can be treated on an out-patient basis. Therefore, they will be unnecessarily occupying beds. There has to be a system where a patient should be evaluated in an emergency treatment unit (ETU). The ETU is also called the PCU (Preliminary Care Unit) in Sri Lankan hospitals. There is a PCU unit at the LRH (Lady Ridgeway hospital), where patients are triaged before being sent to the PCU or the OPD. 
A consultant Paediatrician of the PCU of the LRH ( Dr. Kosala Karunaratne) elaborated on the functions of the PCU, and how it reduces unnecessary admission in hospitals. He said,  Before the patient enters into the PCU of the LRH they are triaged by nurses at the entrance of the hospital. Triaging is sorting out ill patients from relatively well patients. The Triage nurse will decide if the patient should either go to the PCU or the OPD. We want to go further and use a scoring system, where the nurses score the children based on their vital signs. This is basically a traffic light system, where the red and the yellow patients come to the PCU while the green patients go to the OPD. From the OPD the child would be able to go home after his consultation. If the patient is sent to the PCU he will be observed for a maximum of 4 hours, and thereafter it will be decided if the child has to be sent home or admitted. The triaging system facilitates in the efficiency of managing and directing the patients. Therefore, the system reduces overcrowding in hospitals. But we need to develop the triage system further, where we can use resources more efficiently and save time. 
Dr. Bimsara further stated, The emergency treatment unit (ETU) and the OPD are two contrasting units. The OPD is where minor ailments are examined, for instance coughs and colds. The ETU is a treatment unit where the patient is examined before admission. The doctors who are at the ETU decide whether a patient should be admitted or not. For example, if a patient has acute asthma, the patient can be nebulized and maybe sent home. But, if a patient is critically ill he will be admitted. This is up to the discretion of the ETU. The problem is that though there are ETUs in most government hospitals, it is not well established. If there is better organization in the ETU, the congestion in hospitals would reduce. 
He added, There are also actual infrastructure problems, where the number of beds is inadequate in some hospitals. But, simple changes that could take place, such as the proper assessment of patients at the OPD to ensure patients are properly screened before being admitted or discharged by a general practitioner, is a key solution in reducing this predicament. This is why we need a proper referral system to be established in Sri Lanka. 

Bed manager in hospitals
Dr Amitha stated that establishing a bed manager in government hospitals would be one of the solutions for the inefficiency in resource allocation. The role of the bed manager is a model which is taken from UK NHS (National Health Service) hospitals where the role is taken on by an on-call nurse matron or nurse who will take the role of a bed manager. 
According to the NHS, UK bed management involves constantly monitoring hospital admissions, discharges and patient movement within the hospital, so that accurate information is gathered to identify bed availability across all wards. The bed managers use this information to place patients in beds on the wards that are most appropriate to their needs.

Trump sworn in as 45th President of USA
	
Donald John Trump was sworn in Friday as the 45th president of the United States, taking office on a day that has featured smaller crowds and more subdued ceremony than previous inaugurations  but still ushers in a transformative shift in the countrys leadership.
Trump, 70, was administered the oath by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. His wife Melania Trump stood at his side. The oath was given using two Bibles  one from President Lincolns inauguration, and another that Trumps mother gave him in 1955.
Earlier on Friday morning, Trump met with outgoing President Barack Obama at the White House  an Inauguration Day tradition, made more unusual this time by the two mens history.
Trump, a real estate businessman and reality-TV star, began his rise in conservative politics by essentially calling Obama a liar and an illegitimate president: Trump insisted for years that Obama was born in Kenya. Obama was actually born in Hawaii, as Trump conceded late in the 2016 campaign. Obama, in turn, had mocked Trump at a televised White House Correspondents Association dinner in 2011.
Now, they met at the White House door, one going in and one going out.
The two men and their wives took a motorcade to the U.S. Capitol, through empty streets.
Around them, there were sporadic clashes between police and protesters around Washington. In several instances, news video showed black-clad protesters  some carrying symbols of anarchist groups  smashing shop windows and overturning newspaper boxes.
Earlier Friday morning, the Trumps attended a service at St. Johns Episcopal Church near the White House, continuing an Inauguration Day tradition. One of the preachers was Robert Jeffress, a Southern Baptist minister who is pastor of a Dallas megachurch, and who has made inflammatory condemnations of both Mormonism and Islam in the past.
Jeffress, who grew close to Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, said on Twitter that his sermon would be entitled, When God Chooses a Leader. Trump left the service about 9:30 a.m. He mouthed Thank you to supporters as he climbed into an SUV.
[Live updates on the inauguration of Donald Trump]
Before Trump and Vice President Mike Pence took their respective oaths, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.)  who oversaw inauguration preparations on Capitol Hill  offered a brief speech praising the American tradition of peaceful transfer of power.
Commonplace and miraculous, Blunt called it, recalling the early, key transitions between early American presidents of different parties. That made inauguration ceremonies, Blunt said, not a celebration of victory, [but] a celebration of democracy.
After that, a series of Christian ministers offered Bible verses and prayers. Samuel Rodriguez, a California minister, chose to read from the Sermon on the Mount, including Jesus promise that God blesses those who are humble, for they will inherit the earth.
President Trump will attend a luncheon at the Capitol Friday afternoon, and his inaugural parade down Pennsylvania Avenue will begin about 3 p.m. That parade is supposed to last about 90 minutes  which would make it one of the shortest inaugural parades in recent history.
Signs of the transfer of power were evident throughout the morning.
Before 9:30 a.m., TV footage showed Obama leaving the Oval Office for the last time, before he and the first lady held a pre-inauguration tea with the Trumps. Obama smiled as he walked down an exterior hallway, in view of cameras. Any last words for the American people a member of the press called out. Thank you, Obama said.
Soon after, the Trumps arrived at the White House, greeting the Obamas and presenting them with a gift  a box wrapped in the distinctive light blue of high-end jeweler Tiffany & Co. The Obamas seemed briefly perplexed about what to do with it, with the president looking in vain for someone to hold the box while the new first couple and the old took a photo together.
Since Trumps election, both men have tried to mend their relations, including with a high-profile meeting days after Trumps stunning election.
On the White House steps, the bitter history between Trump and Obama went unmentioned. Obama asked Trump, How was church and they turned to go inside.
Trumps swearing-in will give Republicans control of both the White House and Congress for the first time since 2006. The new president has promised to undo some of the most significant pieces of Obamas legacy  including his signature health-care law. But Trump also enters office with a significant amount of uncertainty, since he has repeatedly contradicted other Republicans  and himself  on major questions about how immigration, taxes, health care and other issues will be handled in the new administration.
Trump takes office as the least-popular new president in 40 years, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. Forty percent of Americans view Trump favorably, which is 21 points lower than the rating with which Obama will leave office.
But Trump won the election, and so this will be his day. The stage  and the country  he had sought to command will be his, at last.

'Work from home' mooted by WPC
	
The Western Provincial Council (WPC) is to introduce a work-from-home-system or teleworking as a measure to ease traffic congestion and fuel emission in the Colombo City, WPC Chief Minister Isuru Deshapriya said.
A discussion with government institutions on this concept which is to be introduced in collaboration with the Western Province Waste Management Authority (WMA) was held under the CMs guidance at his office.
The CM said traffic in Colombo was an environmental and an economic hazard and teleworking could mitigate this situation by at least 20 per cent."
Teleworking allows employees to work from home or at a teleworking centre on one or more days of the week, using communication tools such as phones, fax, internet or e-mail.
Although various methods were adopted to reduce the traffic in Colombo and the suburbs at peak hours. Toll gates and lane discipline were introduced but none of these methods were successful in reducing traffic congestion, said Dr. Priyantha Wijesooriya, a member of the WMA board of directors.
He said some 225,000 vehicles enter the city daily and the best strategy of managing traffic is to stop the vehicles originating at the source. A demo-project will be launched with registered institutions to monitor and analyze the success of the teleworking system, he said and added that an apex body would be set up to function as a programme secretariat to regulate the entire process.

Cabinet approval sought to legalize abortions
	
Cabinet approval has been sought to legalize abortions in the instances of rape and incest, underage pregnancies (pregnancy occurring in a girl below 16) and serious foetal impairment, it is learnt.
For this purpose, the government is seeking to draft separate legislations as amendments to the Penal Code and to the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to provide for it.
The Justice Ministry has initiated action in this regard in pursuant to the recommendations on decriminalization of abortion by the Committee on GSP plus and another committee headed by Prof. Savitri Goonesekere. In a report submitted to the Cabinet seeking amendments to the existing laws, recommendations have been made in this respect.
The committee has identified that a similar attempt to decriminalize abortions in such cases in 1995 by introducing a bill. However it was withdrawn due to objections and protests. Currently, abortion or termination of pregnancies is criminalized in the Penal Code except in instances where the mental; and physical well-being of a woman concerned is affected.
The Cabinet report says that septic abortions remain a leading cause of maternal deaths. It says 90 per cent of abortions are performed on married women, and 8.9 percent on unmarried women.
Section 303 of the Penal Code says, Whoever voluntarily causes a woman with child to miscarry shall, if such miscarriage be not caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman , be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine or with both, and if the woman be quick with child, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years , and also be liable to fine.(Kelum Bandara)

China-backed trade pact gains as Trump threatens to ditch TPP
	

DAVOS AFP /Jan19, 2017- Asia will push ahead with a Chinese-supported free trade agreement if Donald Trump follows through on pledges to ditch the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), global leaders in Davos were told Thursday. 
Speaking at the World Economic Forum, a panel of regional experts said Asia must be prepared for a world in which the United States will take a back seat in global trade while China assumes a bigger leadership role. 
Trump, who takes office on Friday, has promised to tear up existing free-trade deals and withdraw from the TPP negotiated by his predecessor Barack Obama.  Trump has also said he will focus on creating employment at home and threatened to impose punitive measures on companies that move business overseas at the expense of local jobs. 
We really have to prepare ourselves for a very different world where America -- instead of becoming the cheerleader for trade -- becomes in some ways the biggest obstacle to trade, said Kishore Mahbubani, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore. 
Mahbubani praised Chinese President Xi Jinpings speech at Davos on Tuesday in which he warned against blaming globalisation for the worlds ills or retreating behind protectionist walls.

Dead woman returns after 25 years
	
The return of a young woman who had disappeared during the 1988-89 insurrection created a sensational issue in Giraulla in Gampola yesterday and she became the cynosure of a crowd gathered.
The young woman Padma Kumari who had been 18 years of age when she disappeared is 43 years old today. The Grama Niladhari of the area said her next of kin had even received compensation for her from the Ganga Ihala Korala Divisional Secretariat.
After her marriage the woman had settled in her husbands house at Kohombamada area, but her marriage life lasted only three months due to the death of her husband who was abducted by four masked men and was shot dead in a tea estate.
Relating her harrowing experience after the death of her husband she said that she left the area in fear of any possible threat to her life and settled in the house of a relative in Nawalapitiya.
However the relative handed me over to a house in Colombo where I had to work as a servant for 26 long years facing hardship. I was not allowed even to attend my fathers and brothers funerals. I had to look after two children in that house. One of them is now 30 years and the other is 26 years. Last Monday 16, I managed to flee from that house. When I returned home no one in the household could not make me out. Ultimately my brother identified me from my identity card. she said.
She requested the authorities to take legal action against the individuals who kept her for 26 years as a servant by force and those responsible for her husbands death.
The Nawalapitiya Police that initiated investigations into the incident admitted her last morning to the Nawalapitiya Hospital for medical examination. (Suranga Rajanayake)

Drone journalism The height of technological advancement
	
Technological advancements are widely appreciated as they allow people to exert less manual effort and get things done in fractions of seconds. While such novelties are needed in this century that boasts quite a lot about taking things to the next level, their long-term consequences too are largely felt. The usage of drones has set a trend from capturing images to recording or gathering information, thus increasing the sale of drones around the world and right here in Sri Lanka as well. Drones hovering around significant events that took place at state level made headlines during the recent past thereby prompting the government to impose more stringent regulations on their usage. In an attempt to shed light on this matter, the Daily Mirror spoke to a few individuals of varied expertise.

It is vital that drone users be aware of all regulations before using them
Commenting on this subject, K.W. Janaranjana, editor of Ravaya newspaper, said when looking at it in a positive manner, it definitely was a technological advancement introduced to media.
Whatever you cannot see at the eye-level is captured from an aerial view through this device. But when using it, there have to be certain regulations that the users need to adhere to. There is a limit for everything. Even expressing an idea has its own limits. Therefore, drone users should be well aware of these regulations before using them. Through these devices, the users can interfere in to another persons privacy and this should be stopped through the media itself. One incident where the use of drones was heavily criticised was during the exhumation of Lasantha Wickrematunges body parts. This drone was sent against the request of the family.
Speaking further, Mr. Janaranjana said even the RTI Bill had limits.
There is a certain limit to which people should know information. In fact, certain information needs to remain confidential. Hence, it is vital to consider media ethics before using any device which would otherwise interfere in the safety and privacy of the people.
Eyes in the Sky need ethical and careful pilots
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, science writer, broadcaster and development communicator Nalaka Gunawardene said for some, drones conjure images of death and destruction  military applications have been their most widely-reported application.
But unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs are being used increasingly for many peaceful purposes. That poses a host of ethical and legal challenges we must confront to get the best of this new technology while minimising potential harm. In the past few years, the cost of drones came down (an entry level unit sells for around LKR 35,000 in Colombo), as their versatility increased. This spurred many users from news-gathering and post-disaster assessments to goods delivery and smart farming.
In Sri Lanka, surveyors, photographers, TV journalists and political parties were among the early civilian users of drones. They all grasped the value of the bigger picture perspective such as aerial photos or videos they can provide. Until recently, accessing that vantage point was possible only through helicopters or fixed wing aircraft  a facility only few could afford. Having the birds eye view helps journalists and their audiences to make sense of complex situations like climate change impacts, conflicts over resources or political agitation. We certainly need more field-based and investigative reporting that goes beyond press releases and press conferences. Drones are fast joining the journalists toolkit -- but what matters is their imaginative and responsible use.
Here, we have both good news and bad news. On the positive side, over two dozen journalists and photojournalists have been trained in drone-assisted journalism during 2016 by drone journalism enthusiast (and drone pilot) Sanjana Hattotuwa and journalist Amantha Perera. Some trainees have since done good stories with drone-gathered images. Examples include probing the droughts impacts in the dry zone, rising garbage crisis in Kattankudy on the east coast and taking a closer look at land use patterns in Hambantota. The downside is that some news organisations are deploying drones without due regard for public safety or existing codes of media ethics. A drone hovered over the Colombo general cemetery as slain editor Lasantha Wickrematunges body was exhumed in September 2016. That disregarded a family request for privacy.
In his concluding remarks, Mr. Gunawardene said the end never justified the means in good journalism.
If some media groups continue to operate drones in such a reckless manner, they risk discrediting the new technology and attracting excessive regulations. Drones or any other new technology need to be anchored in the basic ethics of journalism. Each new tool would also bring along its own layer of ethics. Where drone use is concerned, respecting privacy and considering the safety of others are far more important than using a handheld camera. In February 2016, the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL) published regulations for drone operation which apply to all users including journalists. The Information Department, in a recent release, says it is working with CAASL to simplify these rules and to streamline approval processes. That is a welcome move.
For now, Lankan journalists can follow the Code of Ethics for Drone Journalists already formulated by practitioners and researchers in the United States. It is available at:
http://www.dronejournalism.org/code-of-ethics/.
Drone regulations in other countries are much tougher
In his comments to the Daily Mirror, Dr. Ranga Kalansooriya, the Director General of Government Information said every drone user had to register with the Civil Aviation Authority and later get the approval from the area Police station.
This is not a new imposition. The RTI act is about state information. If you look at the regulations in the UK, they are much tougher as they require a pilot licence for those operating an unmanned aircraft. In India, every take off should be approved by the Defence Ministry. Our regulations are not tough when compared with other countries. Also, the use of drones is about privacy and various ethical issues go in to consideration. We have to also think about the safety aspect. Therefore, the use of drones has got nothing to do with the RTI act.


Highlights of the Implementing Standards issued by the CAA
Earlier this month, the Director General of Civil Aviation issued the Implementing Standards that should be complied when operating pilotless aircraft under the provision of Section 80 of the Civil Aviation Act, Article 8 of its Schedule or the applicable International Standards and Recommended Practices specified in Appendix 4 of Annex 2 to the convention.

 A pilotless aircraft must not be operated;
1. Above any property unless explicit prior consent has been obtained from persons occupying that property or the property owner.
2. Causing safety or security hazards to a third person or property .
 Nothing shall be dropped nor shall any banner be displayed in a pilotless aircraft in flight without approval from the Director General of Civil Aviation.
 A person who operates a pilotless aircraft must, at all times; maintain visual line of sight with the aircraft; be able to see the surrounding airspace in which the aircraft is operating; and maintain the aircraft below the cloud base.
 Pilotless aircraft shall not be operated in a race or competition of any form, without special approval from the Director General of Civil Aviation.
 A pilotless aircraft shall not be operated from dusk to dawn (night)

Recap of incidents where drones made headlines
 During the exhumation of the remains of the late Lasantha Wickrematunge, a drone, which was said to be owned by a private media channel, hovered around the site to capture images of the exhumation. Following a request made by the family, the media was not allowed to enter the Borella cemetery while the exhumation was carried out.
 The drone camera of a private TV channel was seized during the recent clash at Hambantota during the inauguration of the Sri Lanka-China Industrial Zone. Here, the Police had not been notified about their usage of this remote control equipment into a space with diplomats, dignitaries and other foreign delegates.
 A man was detained after he lost control of a drone he had been operating and later fell on to the base of the sacred Ruwanwelisaya. At the time of the incident, the suspect had been taking footage of a Kapruka Pooja which was being held at the archaeological site.

Iraq forces clear east Mosul ahead of push for west bank
	

MOSUL AFP Jan19, 2017 - Iraqi forces battled the last holdout jihadists in east Mosul Thursday after commanders declared victory there and set their sights on the citys west, where more tough fighting awaits. 
The announcement that the left bank of the Tigris River that divides Mosul had been retaken was a key milestone in an offensive that began three months ago but could yet last several more. 

Staff General Talib al-Sheghati, who heads the Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS) spearheading the fighting in Mosul, declared the left bank liberated at a big press conference on Wednesday. 

Iraqi forces were still fighting there on Thursday, flushing out fighters from the Islamic State group in two key northern locations by the river: a large hotel and a presidential compound. 
CTS moved in on Thursday morning so there would not be... pressure on the army, which is charge of that sector, Staff Lieutenant General Abdulghani al-Assadi, a top commander in the CTS, told AFP.
