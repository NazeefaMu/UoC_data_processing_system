Don?t believe self-styled war analysts: Mahesh Senanayake
	
Responding allegations of retired Army officers, that they were not contended with the battle alertness of the Army at present, Army Commander Mahesh Senanayake said that no one could review the Army's strength after having gone on retirement years ago,
?They have no moral right to do so,? he said.
He said the Sri Lanka Army, with the dedicated objective of strengthening it further when necessary had consulted former Commanders and retired Officers with battle-hardened experience with good faith and the Army would continue such practices unfailingly in future.
In a media communiqu? about current security preparedness Lieutenant General Senanayake said
?Relocation or shifting of camps that remained at the time of the culmination of the war, and also afterwards does not in any way amount to any lapse, and such alterations are done, assessing security developments at ground level particularly on the recommendations of respective field commanders.
?It is pertinent to note here that some former Army Commanders also have effected such changes in the past. Such courses of action, if necessary would continue in future also, assessing the security needs of the country,? he said.
The Commander said battalions with lesser number of troops had been reinforced under the Army?s right-sizing programme ?having taken all necessary measures to place all Battalions and Units on alert? to face any eventualities in an organized manner.
?Some individual who have been identified themselves as ?War-Analysts? had defined this procedure as s closure of camps",Lieutenant General Senanayake said.
?By this time, all units under the Security Force Headquarters-Jaffna? have been reorganized under the right-sizing programme, and the Sri Lanka Army challenges those so-called ?War analysts? to publicly name what those operationally important camps, said to have been closed down, if any.? he said.
?Some opportunists are trying to criticize the national security for personal and political motives.
He requested the public to ignore those opportunists? claims and to repose the confidence in the Army, which has defended the country in the past.
?The Sri Lanka Army will take all measures to prevent any resurgence of war in future,? he said.

PM says get ready for PC elections
	
Prime Minister and Leader of UNP Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said he had instructed the party to get ready for the provincial council elections which will be held soon.
Mr. Wickremesinghe expressed this sentiments during the UNP Bala Mandala meeting in Kandy today.
He said he had instructed party hierarchy to remove those grass root members of the UNP in areas such as Central Province who does not work and replace them with others who could work.
?Kandy is a UNP strong hold. Therefore, we should not lose it at any time. We must get ready to face the provincial council elections,? the Prime Minister said.
?The airport and the port was on a standstill when UNP first took over the government in 2001. Exports were down.
However, we restored the economy. We also went into a creasefire agreement with the LTTE. Our government was accused of betraying the nation. However, LTTE Leader Prabhakaran said ceasefire agreement was a trap. The economy picketed up by 2003.
However, Parliament was dissolved in 2004. We lost the election. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa took over in 2005. They could not capitalize on the economic stability which we created although they won the war. They could not settle the debts. This is why they went for early elections. One has to be a fool to go for early polls or he or she does not have the ability to face a crisis. Former President is not a fool but he could not face an economic crisis.
Elections were held in 2015 and we came to power. We stabilized the economy this time as well. However, we will not allow any one to grab the government this time as our intention is to form a UNP government in 2020,? the Prime Minister said.
?Many including the media thought we are over for good after the local government election. People gave us a message. We should read it and work towards a change. We have changed to some extent but need to do some more,? he added.
UNP General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said UNP will form a government in 2020.
Venerable Dambara Amila Thera who also attended the meeting said the government that would come to power in 2020 could be either a UNP government or a joint government of UNP and SLFP. ?UNP wants to have its own government in 2020 but still there is a possibility of a joint government,? he said.
Minister Lakshman Kiriella said human rights issues in Sri Lanka has become a less important issue today. ?UN Human Rights Council in 2014 allocated two days to discuss about Sri Lanka in 2014. However only 2 hours were allocated to discuss about Sri Lanka in 2016,? he said. (Yohan Perera, J. A. L. Jayasinghe and L. B. Senaratne)

Tense situation at Aruwakkalu: Minister wants to apply the law strictly
	
A tense situation prevailed when Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka held a discussion this morning at Wanathawilluwa Divisional Secretariat on the Aruwakkalu Hygienic Solid Waste Disposal Project (AHSWDP) in Puttalam.
The Minister was in discussion with members of the Pradeshiya Sabha and Divisional Secretary of Wanathawilluwa last morning when a group of villagers staged a protest against the project saying that a drain has been excavated to release waste to the lagoon.
However, it was later revealed that the drain had been cut to take flood water to the lagoon as the development activities were affected during the rainy season.
The protesters have damaged properties of the development site and Minister Ranawaka had instructed the law enforcement authorities to apply the law strictly to those who damaged state property.
The protesters claimed that their place of living Aruwakkalu has been selected to dump all rubbish and waste from outside and as a result, the Puttalam Lagoon has been turned into a rubbish dump which they could not stand.
The Wanathawilluwa Police took much efforts to maintain law and order at the site and told protesters to resolve the issue with dialogue and compromise with authorities.
The project AHSWDP will see the transfer by train of solid waste in sealed containers from Kelaniya Railway Station to an engineering sanitary landfill site to be built in Aruwakkalu in the Puttalam District.
?The Environment Impact Assessment has been done in July 2015 after the present government came into power? the Minister Ranawaka pointed out. (Sandun A Jayasekera and Thilanka Kanakarathna)
