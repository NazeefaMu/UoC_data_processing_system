Bickering among JO bigwigs over Paadayathra blunders
	
As the din of public debate over the paadayathra appears trailing off, recriminations among JO stalwarts have begun over the failure to pull their weight to make the event a success, they say.
Some charge that certain ?main actors? who vowed to bring large crowds had failed to produce for the event even one fifth of the number they promised. They say that they estimated the turnout at the final day?s public rally would be a record one million based on the numbers promised by these ?main actors.??
Meanwhile, senior ones have lashed out at some young politicos for marring the spirit of the event and drawing public flak by staging dances and shouting offensive slogans during the paadayathra.?
However, a proposal to make this event an annual feature has received the approval of the majority of the JO group, they say.

Ceylinco Life head office gets biggest  solar power system in Colombo
	
Ceylinco Life has broken new ground in the sphere of eco-friendly operations with the installation of the biggest solar electricity system in the city of Colombo to date.
The life insurance leader has announced it is converting its head office building in Colombo 5 to solar power, with a system capacity of 63.18kW.
To be completed in August 2016, the project will result in an annual reduction of 65 tons of CO2 emitted to the environment as a result of consumption of power from the national grid and thermal power generators, the company said.
The solar power plant at the company?s head office is expected to generate a saving of 7,200 units of electricity per month.
?Even though we do not consume as much electricity as a manufacturing company, we have made a firm commitment to maximise the use of renewable energy as part of our obligations to the principle of sustainability,? Ceylinco Life Managing Director/CEO R. Renganathan said.
?Already, all new branches constructed on company-owned land are designed to be Green buildings, and are powered by solar energy, significantly reducing their carbon footprint.?
Among the Ceylinco Life branches already using solar power are Kurunegala, Batticaloa, Ratnapura, Trincomalee, Bandarawela and Wennappuwa. Together, they contribute to a reduction of 52.5 tons of CO2 per year. These buildings are designed for optimal use of natural light and also have facilities for rainwater harvesting.
In January this year, Ceylinco Life launched a series of environment-related initiatives across the 250 plus countrywide branch network of the company as part of a year-long sustainability drive comprising of three elements ? ?Reuse?, ?Reduce? and ?Encourage.? Among the initiatives was the planting of 4,000 trees in branch premises and the homes of staff.
Under this campaign Ceylinco Life employees are expected to reuse as many resources as possible, reduce use of resources where feasible and engage in similar activities in their homes. A dedicated portal has been created to track participation and progress of the tree planting campaign and branches have been given a comprehensive checklist to assist their efforts to reuse and reduce consumption of resources.
The market leader in Sri Lanka?s life insurance sector since 2004, Ceylinco Life has close to a million lives covered by active policies. The company is acknowledged as the benchmark for innovation in the local insurance industry for its work in product research and development, customer service, professional development and corporate social responsibility.

## Title: ComBank products for children, a win-win for account holders and bank

ComBank products for children, a win-win for account holders and bank
	
Twenty five years after it pioneered a savings product for minors, Commercial Bank of Ceylon continues to devote attention to developing products for children, a segment immensely important to the long-term vision of the bank. Today, children?s accounts represent about a tenth of the bank?s account base and play a noteworthy role in keeping its current account-savings account (CASA) ratio, one of the healthiest in the local banking sector. In this interview, Commercial Bank Deputy General Manager Personal Banking Sandra Walgama elaborates on the bank?s focus on children.
Excerpts:
There seems to be a growing emphasis in Sri Lanka on the banking products for children. How does Commercial Bank view this trend?
Commercial Bank has always considered children a very important segment, both in terms of the products it offers as well as in terms of its corporate social responsibility initiatives. We in fact pioneered the savings product for children with the Isuru Minors? Saving Plan in 1991. It is a unique savings product and is one of the best performing products in its category, having evolved over the past 25 years. Banking products for children continue to receive a lot of attention at Commercial Bank, because we believe in its potential and the fact that they build a very worthy customer base in the Future.
?
What products does the bank have for this segment?
The Isuru Minors? Savings Plan is one of our principal savings accounts for children. It is a product that has been periodically improved with the addition of new features. Earlier this year, we launched Isuru VI, increasing the guaranteed amount receivable to Rs.8.8 million, when the child turns 18. Another equally popular children?s account is the Arunalu savings account, which is linked to a scheme that rewards high achievers at the Year 5 scholarship examination each year.
?
What makes these products special?
Let?s look at the Isuru Minors? Savings Plan first. It covers the period from birth to majority ? age 18 ? and offers parents two savings options ? a monthly deposit scheme or a lump sum deposit scheme, whichever suits their financial capacity. Under the lump sum deposit scheme, the guaranteed amount the bank will pay when the child turns 18, depends on the age of the child at the time the account is opened. Parents may deposit between Rs.5,000 and Rs.1 million at any time between the day the child is born and the child?s 10th birthday. A deposit of Rs.1 million at birth will guarantee the child a payment of more than Rs.5.7 million at the age of 18.
Under the monthly deposit option, the guaranteed amount depends on factors such as age of the child, agreed amount of the monthly deposit and the deposit period. The account could be opened for children between the ages of one day and 10 years and the parents may choose to save between Rs.500 and Rs.20,000 (in multiples of Rs.500) a month, for five or 10 years. A 10-year savings plan opened at birth of a child with a monthly commitment of Rs.20,000 will guarantee a payment of Rs.8.8 million, when the child turns 18.
For parents who wish to save for their children, these figures are attractive, but what makes Isuru Minors? Savings Plan extra special is the fact that the bank undertakes to pay the final guaranteed amount when the child turns 18, even in the event, the monthly deposits being interrupted due to the untimely demise of the depositor.
?
And what are the unique features of the Arunalu children?s account?
The distinguishing feature of the Arunalu children?s savings account is its cash rewards scheme for high achievers at the Year 5 scholarship examinations. Every year, Arunalu account holders have the opportunity to win cash prizes from the bank if they are placed first, second or third at the national, district or school levels at the scholarship examination. This is intended to inspire young students and emphasise the value of good education.
The bank pays up to Rs.382,500 to the top three scorers islandwide at the Year 5 scholarship examination usually held in August every year, if they are Arunalu account holders. On this basis, the student or students placed first will receive up to Rs.170,000 in monthly instalments of Rs.2,000 ?till the age of 18. Similarly, students placed second in the island will receive up to Rs.127,500- in monthly instalments of Rs.1,500, while those placed third will receive up to Rs.85,000 in monthly instalments of Rs.1,000 each.
Even if there are multiple winners within the top three ranks in the country, Arunalu rewards all such winners on the above basis. For instance, in 2015 there were 11 winners within the top three at the Year 5 scholarship examination and Arunalu paid Rs.635,000 to all 11 winners.
Additionally, Arunalu account holders ranked first in their respective districts at the examination receive up to Rs.50,000 and the account holders who are placed first, second and third in their schools receive cash prizes of Rs.10,000, Rs.7,500 and Rs.5,000 each, respectively.
In the four years from 2012 to 2015, we paid a cumulative Rs.21.2 million in cash prizes to Arunalu account holders, who excelled at the Year 5 scholarship examinations and in 2015 alone, the bank paid out Rs.5.5 million under the scheme to 675 students placed first, second and third in their schools at the Year 5 scholarship examination. This was in addition to the cash rewards paid to eight students who were placed first, second and third in the island at the examination.
?
How successful have these products been?
They have been extremely successful and very popular among parents. Today children?s accounts represent about a 10th of our total accounts and we feel there is potential for further growth.
?
What are the factors that have contributed to the success of these products?
First and foremost, these products appeal to the instincts of parents. The next important factor is trust. Since these are long-term products, parents look for a bank that is stable and trustworthy and in those aspects Commercial Bank stands out. Being the most respected bank in Sri Lanka for the 11th consecutive year and the second ?Most Respected? corporate entity in the country for the fifth consecutive year in the annual LMD rankings, ?Commercial Bank was also ranked No 1 in Sri Lanka for ?Honesty? for the third successive year. The rates of interest and the final guaranteed sum are also important factors. Added to all these factors are the features, which are improved periodically as the products and the market evolves.
?
Given the features of the banking products for children, are they profitable/sustainable for the bank?
Yes they are. Our children?s savings products represent a win-win for the parents and the bank. Additionally, from the bank?s point of view, children?s accounts are our future adult customers, so building a relationship with this segment makes sense.
How do you see these products evolving in the years ahead?
Children?s banking products will continue to thrive and the bank will continue to look for exciting and innovative new features to add on to this product range. ?

Court orders report on ex-SDIG?s admission to paying ward
	
Over the inquiry into the murder of ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen, Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris today ordered prosecution to obtain a comprehensive report from Director of Colombo National Hospital and Prison Superintendent over the admission of the second suspect ex-SDIG, Anura Senanayake into the paying ward of the CNH, without providing treatment to him from the Prison Hospital.
The Magistrate gave the direction observing the request made by the aggrieved party counsel, Misba Sathar.
Observing that a suspect in remand custody has equal right to get treatments for his medical condition, the Magistrate said the suspect could be only allowed to admit to a National Hospital due to insufficient treatments for his condition from the Prisons Hospital under the direction of the Medical Officer at the Prison Hospital.
The Defence Counsel, who appeared for the second suspect requested court to allow his client to attend his daughter's convocation under the supervision of Prison Authority.
Objecting to the request, Senior State Counsel, who appeared for the Attorney General said the suspect had no special privileges to ask such requests from court and that he was an accused in a murder case for fabricating false evidence.
The Magistrate rejecting the defence request ascertained that attending to a convacation cannot be regarded as an exceptional circumsatnce and that no such suspect in remand custody is allowed to request such permission from court based on the legal concept of "no one is guilty until proven", since the suspect has allegtions over a murder inquiry.
Former SDIG Anura Senanyake and former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Perera were ordered to be further remanded till August 24 by the Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris today over the inquiry conducted into the killing of ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen.
The former SDIG and the former Crimes OIC also have charges of causing disappearance of evidence, fabricating false evidence, touching it to screen the offender and conspiring under Clauses of 189,198 and 296 of the Penal Code.
The Defence Counsel also informed Court that the two suspects had already filed revision bail applications in Colombo High Court seeking bail over the magisterial inquiry. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

DFCC Bank 2Q net up 20% over strong core banking
	
The DFCC Bank PLC group increased its June quarter (2Q16) net profits by 20 percent to Rs.747 million or Rs.2.82 a share from a year ago supported by stronger core banking operations, the interim financial accounts of the bank showed. ?
Despite the banking group increasing its net interest income (NII), the interest expenses were seen rising at a faster rate than the interest income due to the rising deposit costs.?
The NII rose 15.8 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.2.05 billion amid interest expenses rising 63.6 percent YoY. But the interest income rose by only 41.1 percent YoY.?
The bank?s loan book grew only 4.1 percent or Rs.6.9 billion to Rs.173.4 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2016 (1H16) but the deposit growth surpassed the growth in advances.?
Overdrafts rose by Rs.2.8 billion to Rs.26.8 billion while the bank?s gold-backed loans grew by Rs.220 million to Rs.1.75 billion.?
The deposits recorded a growth of 8.3 percent or Rs. 9.2 billion to Rs.120.1 billion.?
DFCC Bank was seen aggressively campaigning for deposits during the 1H16 but has failed to show results because the total deposits had been risen by only a single or by a few foreign currency fixed deposit/s worth Rs.10.9 billion.?
The rupee deposits have in fact fallen by Rs.1.7 billion during the period.?
The low-cost deposits measured by the current and savings account (CASA) ratio too have fallen sharply to 16.47 percent from 19.02 percent in December 2015.?
These changes in funding mix and the rise in interest expenses outweighing the rise in interest income may have most likely dented the bank?s net interest margin, though the bank did not disclose its margin in its interim accounts.?
The then development financier, DFCC Bank PLC merged with its fully-owned subsidiary DFCC Vardhana Bank Limited to form a fully-fledged commercial bank.?
The group also consists of its subsidiaries Lanka Industrial Estates Limited, DFCC Consulting (Pvt.) Limited and Synapsys Limited (SL), the joint venture company Acuity Partners (Pvt.) Limited and the associate company - National Asset Management Limited (NAMAL).?
Meanwhile, the group fee and commission income rose by a little under 10 percent YoY to Rs.295.3 million.?
The net gain from the bank?s trading book increased to Rs.209.4 million from Rs.61.9 million but the unrealized losses of the equity holdings have been Rs.167.8 million against a loss of Rs.647.8 million during the corresponding period last year. ?
However, these unrealized losses for the 1H16 had been as high as Rs.2.94 billion against Rs.1.32 billion a year ago due to the downturn in the Colombo Stock Exchange.?
The banking group has also made a loss on forward exchange contracts revaluation of Rs.149.6 million during the 1H16 from a profit of Rs.162.9 million recorded a year ago. ??
Further, during the 1H16, the bank has received a dividend income of Rs.576.9 million against Rs.544.7 million mainly composed of the dividends received from the bank?s investment in the Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC shares.?
The individual impairments rose to Rs.157.6 million from Rs.121.9 million a year ago due to, ?provisions made on account of two large exposures based on available objective evidence.
The ratio of impaired loans to total loans as at June 30, 2016 was 5.5 percent compared to 5.1 percent as at December 31, 2015. The cumulative allowance for impairment for loans and advances was maintained at a healthy level of 70 percent of impaired loans and advances as at June 30, 2016,? the bank?s Chief Executive Officer Arjun Fernando said in an earnings release.?
Meanwhile, during the 1H16 the banking group made a net profit of Rs.1.7 billion or Rs.6.42 a share, up 17.7 percent YoY.?
As at June 30, 2016, state-owned Bank of Ceylon held 14.35 percent of the bank, followed by Hatton National Bank PLC with a 12.22 percent stake.?
The state-controlled private sector pension fund, the Employees? Provident Fund held a 9.19 percent stake as the fourth largest shareholder.?

Ex-LTTErs deaths - NPC calls for inquiry
	
The Northern Provincial Council, yesterday, unanimously adopted a proposal to inquire into reports of suspicious deaths of ex-LTTE cadres who had undergone rehabilitation.
107 former LTTE cadres had died after being rehabilitated and released, according to reports. Over 11,000 cadres who surrendered during the last stages of the war, or were captured, were later rehabilitated by the state (after the war ended).
The proposal which was submitted by Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran was adopted following a lengthy exchange of views between the ruling party and the opposition.
The chief minister said the proposal was based on various reports and submissions by former LTTE cadres to the Reconciliation Task Force, regarding some suspicious medical treatment given to them while they were undergoing rehabilitation.
"There needs to be a proper investigation into the issues raised. We shouldn't jump to conclusions. The members must must discuss this with those who underwent rehabilitation and report the findings to the Council" he said.
Following the proposal, the Provincial Minister of Health, Dr. Pathmanathan Sathiyalingam told the Council that international medical assistance should be sought to ascertain the veracity of the claims.
"There are reports of injections being administered during the period of rehabilitation -- and these issues must be investigated thoroughly, he said.
Ananthi Sasitharan, who spoke at the meeting, mentioned specific tnstances that she had been informed of by former cadres where they had been injected with unknown substances.
Following the debate, the council resolved to call upon the government to release all medical records pertaining to the ex-cadres, to seek international medical assistance to ascertain the cause of the deaths and to facilitate the inquiries and provide medical assistance to the surviving cadres.

This state-owned undertaking called the pride of the island nation has been carrying the national flag of the country high in the air throughout the globe for several decades. Due to years of mismanagement, this national venture went on the rocks and it is now being run at a?terrible loss.?
When the yahapalanaya government took office, its top brass decided to put back the faltering undertaking upright. They appointed several big names in the corporate sector to the board of management. They squeezed in a few political favourites too to certain?

However, everyone including the employees of the national venture who were highly elated that the glamorous ?monera? would take off for a new era of successful flying are in tears today. For the hand-picked appointees to the board of management having forgotten a sacred job entrusted to them have got split into two factions and are embroiled in a protracted feud. The feud had taken a turn for the worse with several purohitas entering the scene to side one faction or the other, they say.?

The white-collar one heading the department controlling everything connected with liquor has been given a sudden punishment transfer.
The reason behind this transfer is that the white collar one is a stickler for rules and regulations and he is not prepared to play ball with political bosses giving him unlawful instructions.
He had incurred the wrath of the political authority above him in particular for consigning the latter?s illegal fiats to the waste paper basket.
Among the ?wrongs? committed by the white-collar one were turning down requests by the political authority above him to issue liquor permits for bars and restaurants located near schools and temples and to move out some of his subordinates who were not prepared to bend over backwards to pander to the whims of the authority. ?

The Commerce Minister of India will arrive in the country soon to hold talks on the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament today.
He said the Government had already initiated negotiations on drafting the ETCA and similar deals would be struck with China, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia to find markets for the country?s produce.
He was responding to a question by Joint Opposition MP Jayantha Samaraweera regarding the ETCA.
The Prime Minister said the Development Strategies and International Trade Ministry had been authorised to deal with the subject on behalf of the Government. He said a committee appointed under this Ministry coordinated work with the Indian authorities.
He said the subject minister would sign it on behalf of the Government.
"We have a limited market in the country with only twenty million people. It is not enough. We have to find new markets elsewhere in the world. Without external markets, how can we sell our products,? he said.
Mr. Samaraweera, in a supplementary question, asked whether the Hanuman Bridge would be constructed linking the two countries.
The Prime Minister replied that he had not even considered it.
Yet, he said only those aspiring to make undue commissions would benefit if bridges were constructed in that manner. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

?Paadayathra? has lowered his cholesterol level
	
Many politicians these days are coming out with the findings of the post-mortems they had held on the ?paadayathra? which, of course, invariably suit their political purposes.?
Meanwhile, a JO group the other day held a powwow aimed at making a down-to-earth assessment of the overall political effect produced by this exercise.
The loquacious young politico of ?pure heritage? fame who walked all the way from Kandy to Lipton?s Circus got the undivided attention of everyone present when he addressed the group. ?In addition to the political gains I made from the paadayathra, I reaped a remarkable personal benefit as well from it,? he said. ?What is it?? everyone asked in unison. With a triumphant smile the young politico declared: ?I found I had reduced my weight by 1 ? kilos by the time I reached Colombo.?
This was a signal for some of his Diyawanna colleagues suffering from cholesterol trouble to make a dash to the nearest weighing machine. ?

They have coined a new nickname for him
	
A senior Betel leaf purohita at Diyawanna council has earned a new nickname. This purohita often enjoying a nap at public functions hails from a faraway district, but most of his time is spent in the city.?
Often referred to as ?lucky ladies? man?, this purohita, despite being past his sixties is known to have a terrible weakness for the fairer sex. ?It is no secret that this senior stalwart does not hesitate, given a chance, to make a pass at a female employee on the staff or a female colleague in the council.?
Female Diyawanna members would often gather in the House lobby for a chit-chat pending the start of the sittings of the day. And on such occasions, this purohita would appear from nowhere sporting a wide grin to greet them.?
He enjoys holding the hands of the fair ones while articulating niceties, they say. Though these females among themselves refer to him by the new nickname, they would not dare utter it openly.
Whenever, the purohita is seen approaching them, one of them would say in an undertone: ?There comes our ?Kohelle Baba!? And titters would ensue.?
By the way, if you don?t know what ?kohelle? is, it is the sticky milky substance present in the bark of the Jak tree and also in mature Jak fruits.

Unjustifiable to charge Basil with misusing DN funds: SB
	
Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayaka yesterday cast doubts on charging former Minister Basil Rajapaksa with the misappropriation of Divineguma funds to buy GI pipes.
He told the media that it might not have been a violation of law or a financial fraud but an inappropriate act that took place during an election campaign.
The FCID had charged Mr. Rajapaksa of misappropriating Rs.35 million belonging to the Divineguma funds to purchase and distribute GI pipes to 158 Pradeshiya Sabhas to erect banners and flags in support of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa's re-election bid.
The minister said his perusal of the ministry files had found that the bill for GI pipes had been settled by the Economic Development Ministry and the purchase had been done adhering to proper procedure like calling for open tenders.
?The pipes have been distributed among Pradeshiya Sabhas and I don?t see any corruption involved. Besides, those pipes are of use to Pradeshiya Sabhas for various needs,? he added.
When asked whether it was correct to supply GI pipes by the government to local government bodies to be used for election propaganda the minister said he did not see anything wrong because LG bodies which received GI pipes were under the SLFP. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
