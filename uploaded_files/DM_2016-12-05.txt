ACCA unveils future of global accountancy with new innovations
	
The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) takes a major step forward in shaping the future of accountancy by unveiling major innovations to its Masters level qualification, tailored to meet the strategic challenges of the 21st centurys disruptive economy.
The latest innovations to its qualification are new Strategic Professional exams, which will replace the existing Professional level exams in September 2018 and a new Ethics and Professional Skills module, which will be introduced in 2017. This new groundbreaking design of ACCAs qualification draws on an extensive, two-year review and consultation with members, employers and learning providers.
Added to these developments, ACCA also offers the worlds first Masters degree integrated with a professional accountancy qualification, delivered in partnership with the University of London. This unique arrangement means students can take the Masters route while completing their Strategic Professional exams or take the Masters degree after the ACCA Qualification.
ACCA Chief Executive Helen Brand OBE said, Were updating the ACCA Qualification to give students the forward-thinking strategic abilities and advanced skill-set required of modern professional accountants who will shape the future of global business.
The redesign enhances the breadth and depth of the qualification, with greater focus on employability and the practical application of core skills in the contemporary workplace. This includes Strategic Business Leader, Strategic Business Reporting and an Ethics and Professional Skills module. 
Strategic Business Leader is an innovative case study exam based on a realistic business scenario giving students the skills and technical expertise required by modern business where decisions need to be made, measured and effectively communicated to the wider organisation. Strategic Business Reporting is a new examination that exposes students to the wider context of finance and business reporting, adding vital skills required to explain and communicate to stakeholders the implications of transactions and reporting. The Ethics and Professional Skills module makes modifications to the existing ethics module which ACCA was the first professional body to offer to students in 2008, equipping them with professional skills needed in the modern workplace.
MENASA Regional Director Stuart Dunlop, presenting findings from the ACCA comprehensive research report, Professional accountants  the future to the media in Colombo, said, ACCA members are central to the work we do and it was our membership base that provided the foundation for this piece of research. Consistently the Professional Insights team at ACCA reach out to members and other professionals for their views on the issues and challenges within the profession. Without this support, we would be unable to advance the profession, influence policy, governments and employers. So we thank all contributors for that, it is greatly appreciated by me and everyone at ACCA.
ACCA Sri Lanka and the Maldives Head Nilusha Ranasinghe highlighted, The ACCA qualification is the only professional accountancy qualification which combines local relevance with international best practice. This means that our members are able to work at the highest level in any industry in any sector. In a globalised world this unique feature offers a real edge and benefit to employers.

Allianz Insurance Lanka posts outstanding performance in 3Q16
	
Allianz Lanka had another impressive quarter, recording a 51 percent growth in gross written premium (GWP) of Rs.3 billion in its non-life company, from Rs.2 billion in the same period a year ago. The company continuously recorded the highest industry growth for the past three consecutive quarters and is a noteworthy achievement in a highly competitive market.
The period has been one of significant achievements, with recognitions received for a number of key strategic initiatives. Chief among the accolades received was the regional award for Best Sustainable Insurance Company in South Asia. This prestigious award, conferred by the World HRD Congress, supported by the Asian Confederation of Businesses, validates Allianz Lankas continued commitment to sustainable growth in all areas of business.
Our strong growth reflects the success of the growth strategies that the company has put in place. I am also pleased to see our efforts endorsed with regional recognition, said Allianz Lanka CEO Surekha Alles.
Throughout the 10 plus years of our presence in Sri Lanka, Allianz Lanka did not pursue growth for its own sake but focused on growing our business sustainably instead with the customer at the heart of everythingwe do.
The life company recorded a GWP of Rs.765 million during the same period, which is a year-on-year (YoY) growth of 13 percent, from Rs.676 million in 3Q 2015. The successful performance of the non-life company prompted Allianz Lanka to look at strategies to accelerate growth in life operations as well.
Several new plans and processes are now being introduced to restructure the life company, a main initiative was to welcome on board Nihal Handunge as GM Sales and Distribution, to spearhead the companys life sales distribution and network development.
Handunge has over 32 years of broad-based industry experience, of which over 25 years have been in senior management. He has a track record of achievements and brings a wealth of knowledge on life and non-life insurance to the table. The company is confident that his leadership qualities will give Allianz Life Insurance the impetus to pursue new business opportunities and further strengthen its islandwide network of 58 branches.

Apollo denies reports of Jayalalithaas death, says she is on life support
	
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa passed away after suffering a cardiac arrest, Tamil TV channels reported on Monday evening. Violence broke out at Apollo hospital as soon as the news started trickling out, even though the hospital has not put out an official statement to this affect. Even at 6 pm, Apollo hospital dismissed as rumours the reports of Jayalalithaas death saying she is still alive. The party flag too was flying at half mast at the AIADMK headquarters in Chennai after the reports of her death, but it started flying at full mast after hospitals denial. The chief minister, who has been in Apollo since September 22, had suffered the cardiac arrest on Sunday evening.
The party MLAs are scheduled to meet later this evening apparently to chalk out the next course of action. Though party sources did not reveal the agenda of the meeting scheduled in the evening, they, however, confirmed that the legislators would discuss key matters.
It came as a big setback for her supporters who had been waiting for her to recover from her earlier illness and return to office. The death has left a huge vacuum in Tamil Nadu politics.
The AIADMK chief suffered the cardiac arrest hours after her party told media that she has fully recovered and will be returning home soon.
Born in 1948, Jayalalithaa started her career as an actress in South Indian films. In 1982, she joined the AIADMK, which was founded by her mentor MG Ramachandran. She first became the chief minister of Tamil Nadu in 1991. She has ruled the state for over 15 years. (Source: Indian Express)

Bestow national hero title on 19 Kandyan leaders: Wijeyadasa to MS
	
Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has recommended to President Maithripala Sirisena to cancel Gazette No: 851 issued by the then English Governor Robert Brownrigg in January 10, 1818 naming Keppetipola Disawe and 18 other Sinhala leaders as traitors.
The 19 Kandyan leaders were considered as traitors by the British Government for the mission they launched to free the nation in 1818, three years after the Kandyan Convention was signed making Sri Lanka a British colony.
Governor Brownrigg issued the gazette after having considered the mission of the Sinhalese leaders as a riot against the crown.
For almost 200 years, the leaders who fought for the nation have been named as traitors. Therefore, the minister, in his capacity as the justice minister, has recommended to the President to cancel the gazette and bestow the title of national hero on the 19 leaders, a statement by the Ministry said today.
It said the decision was taken to deliver justice to these leaders and their descendants for the maltreatment and injustice they underwent during the British rule and to recognize them as national heroes who fought for the freedom and integrity of the country.
Keppetipola Disawe, Kiwlegedara Mohottaale, Godagedara Rate Adikaram led the freedom struggle against the British for maintaining a strict administration violating the agreements of the Kandyan Convention, the statement said.
Minister Rajapakshe has recommended that the status of national hero be bestowed on Keppetipola Disawe, Kiwlegedara Mohottale, Godagedara Rate Adikaram, Ketakala Mohottaale, Maha Bethmaraale, Kuda Bethmaraale, Polgolla Mohottaale, Watte Kale Mohottaale, Polgahagedara Rehenaraale, Posrewatta Vidane, Yalagombe Mohottaale, Udumadure Mohottaale, Kohukumbure Rateraale, Kohukumbure Walawwe Mohottaale, Butuwe Rateraale, Baginigahawela Rateraala, Mahabadulle Gammane Rateraale, Bulupitiye Mohottaale and Palle Melheyaye Gamethiraale.
Meanwhile, the ministry requested the public to notify the ministry secretary of details of family members, relatives and descendants of Keppetipola Disawe and other Kandyan leaders who launched the freedom struggle in 1818. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: Constitutional reforms amidst chaos in country: MR

Constitutional reforms amidst chaos in country: MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today issuing a statement said the government has introduced constitutional reforms without reforming the electoral system and abolishing the executive presidency as promised during the Presidential election.
The full statement
The reports submitted by six subcommittees on constitutional reform appointed by the Constitutional Assembly were tabled in parliament while everybodys attention was focused on the budget.
With that government ministers moved fast to meet the Ven. Mahanayake Theras with a view to obtaining their support for these proposals by saying that no recommendations have been made to alter the unitary character of the constitution, the special status accorded to Buddhism or for the merger of the northern and eastern provinces.
Furthermore, leaving aside all the strikes and demonstrations over the budget, the president himself spoke in parliament about the need to devolve power.
In the meantime government parliamentarians and ministers are being showered with all kinds of privileges such as new cars and generous special allowances.
All these are signs that portend great danger to the nation. During the last presidential election campaign, the two main constitutional reforms promised to the people by this government were; the abolition of the executive presidency and reform of the electoral system.
Neither of these two key issues have been dealt with by the subcommittees appointed by the Constitutional Assembly. Instead, six reports have been released on matters that were never even mentioned during the presidential elections. It is only in reading the subcommittee reports that the connection between the above mentioned events became clear.
The subcommittee on Centre Periphery Relations has openly stated that the unitary character of our constitution is an impediment to the functioning of the provincial councils and some of the reports have made recommendations that are designed to end the unitary character of Sri Lanka without however deleting that word from the constitution. I would like to highlight some of the most harmful recommendations as follows:
1. The Subcommittee on Centre-Periphery Relations has made recommendations to strip the provincial Governors of all their powers. The Governors discretionary power to sign into law statutes passed by the PC is to be abolished and that authority given to the Chairman of the provincial council. His discretionary power to refer statutes back to the PC suggesting amendments or to refer a statute to the president to be sent to the supreme court for review is to be abolished. The Governors authority over the provincial public service is to be transferred to the chief minister and the provincial board of ministers. Furthermore, the Governor is to be appointed only with the concurrence of the chief minister and will have to perform his duties on the advice of the chief minister and the provincial board of ministers. Our system of devolution is modelled on that of India and the Governors of the Indian states have exactly the same powers as the provincial Governors in Sri Lanka. It is through the role of the governor that the provinces and the states are bound to the centre. If the powers of the Governors are taken away, both India and Sri Lanka will cease to be unified nations.
2. The list of concurrent powers which are wielded by both the central government and the provincial councils is to be done sway with and those powers transferred to the provincial councils so that the PCs and the central government become distinct spheres of authority. To further this objective, it has been recommended that the District Secretaries and the Divisional Secretaries who now function under the central government be placed under the authority of the provincial councils. Furthermore, the provincial public services commissions are to be allowed to decide on their cadre need including that of the local authorities, without Treasury oversight.
3. The Subcommittee on Centre Periphery Relations has also suggested that powers over state land be transferred to the provincial councils. The central government will be able to utilise state land in the provinces only with the concurrence of the provincial authorities. In India, the central government can use any state land with or without the concurrence of the state concerned.
4. The Subcommittee on police and law and order has recommended that the police force be divided into a national police force and nine separate provincial police forces. The national police will exercise jurisdiction over offences against the state and state property, the armed forces, parliamentarians, judicial and public officers, offences relating to elections, currency and government stamps, and international crimes. Everything else including crime investigations, fraud, narcotics, traffic, etcetera, will be under the provincial police forces. An investigation can be referred to the national police only if the provincial police commissioner consents to it. The provincial police forces will conduct their own training and have the final say in the type of weapons their policemen would use. The IGP will not have any oversight regarding the work of the provincial police. Provincial police personnel are to be recruited on linguistic and residential criteria which together with the fact that there will be no inter-provincial transfers, will mean that the provincial police forces in the north and east will be completely separate and will have virtually no interaction with the rest of the police force.
5. If a state of emergency is to be in force continuously for a period in excess of 3 months or for a period of more than 90 days within a period of 180 days, the extension of the state of emergency will require a special majority in parliament. The courts will be given the power to review and even invalidate the declaration of emergency and the emergency regulations. The judiciary is not equipped to determine whether a situation warrants a declaration of emergency or not and such matters should be the exclusive preserve of the executive. These provisions are obviously meant to ensure that the state will not be able to respond adequately to an emergency. Everyone knows that there are some elements who want to weaken the Sri Lankan State.
6. The Subcommittee on the Judiciary has recommended that when judges of the Supreme Court and the court of appeal are to be appointed, the nomination of suitable candidates would be done by a panel of former supreme court judges. This panel is to be appointed by the incumbent chief justice after consulting the Attorney General and the President of the Bar Association. The Bar Association is a highly politicised body and once had a UNP parliamentarian serving as President. His successor openly worked against my government and accepted a top political appointment from this government. The manner in which the Bar Association accepts funding from foreign powers has been commented on in the media. Such a body should never be given a role in nominating judges to the highest courts. There is also a serious conflict of interest issue in giving the private bar a say in appointing the judges who will be hearing their cases. This will lead to collusion and corruption and erode public confidence in the entire legal system.
7. It has also been recommended by the Subcommittee on the Judiciary that a seven member constitutional court made up of judges and specialists in the field be set up outside the regular court structure to exercise exclusive jurisdiction in relation to interpreting the constitution, reviewing Bills, the post enactment review of legislation and to adjudicate in disputes between the centre and the provinces. If a constitutional matter comes up in any case in any court in the country, it will have to be referred to this constitutional court. Under the present constitution, the interpretation of the constitution and review of Bills is the exclusive preserve of the Supreme Court and this should not be changed. We also have concerns about who the constitutional experts sitting on the bench of this court will be. Furthermore, the principle applied hitherto in this country is that the courts will not have the power of post enactment review of legislation.
8. The Subcommittee on Fundamental Rights has recommended that the standard provision found in most constitutions to the effect that the laws in force at the time the new Constitution comes into force would be valid only to the extent that they dont clash with the new constitution; be dispensed with in relation to the personal laws of certain communities. If any personal law is allowed to stand above the constitution, that would be a case of according to certain communities privileges not available to other communities and will give rise to ethnic and religious tensions.
9. According to Sri Lankas legal system, foreign treaties entered into by the government are not automatically incorporated into domestic law and parliament has to legislate the provisions of that treaty into law. The Subcommittee on Fundamental Rights has recommended that treaties to which Sri Lanka is a party at the time the new constitution comes into effect, should automatically get incorporated into domestic law after a lapse of two years. This is a naked attempt to bring into force through the back door, Optional Protocol I of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which was ill-advisedly signed in 1998 but due to subsequent enlightenment, never incorporated in our law by parliament because it makes our Supreme Court subordinate to the Human Rights Committee in Geneva. The automatic, unplanned incorporation of foreign treaties in our laws in the manner proposed will lead to confusion within the legal system.
10. One of the principal recommendations of the Sub Committee on Fundamental Rights is that both Sinhala and Tamil be recognised as the official languages of Sri Lanka. In 1957 S.J.V.Chelvanayagam proposed to make Tamil the language of administration in the North and the East with reasonable provision for the use of Sinhala for the Sinhala minority living in those areas. This was same the policy that S.W.R.D.Bandaranaike applied to the whole country with Sinhala as the official language and reasonable provision for the use of Tamil especially in the north and east. In India too, Hindi - the language of the largest linguistic group - is the official language while reasonable provision has been made for the use of other languages like Tamil, Malayalam etc. These are arrangements that should not be disturbed with ill-advised experiments. 
I call upon the government to act more responsibly in this all important matter of constitutional reform and to take up the two main electoral reform pledges they gave the people first, before dealing with matters that are of interest only to separatists and certain interested foreign parties. None of the recommendations mentioned above should be in the final draft of the constitution. The fact that the government sent an SLFP delegation to mislead the Ven. MahanayakeTheras about the constitutional reform proposals shows that they are trying to use the nationalistic credentials of the SLFP to deceive the MahaSangha and the people to push through a constitution which will divide the country without using the word division. I request all members of the SLFP serving in this government not to allow their enslavement to the UNP to go so far as to betraying every principle that the SLFP has stood for in the past six decades.

Gammanpila urges Govt. to ban TNA
	
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) today urged the government to ban the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) in order to ensure democracy in Sri Lanka.
Addressing a media briefing, PHU General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila said the TNA was the main opposition of Parliament, and that was the gravest misfortune of the nation.
The TNA has direct links with the LTTE. Earlier, the TNA virtually functioned as the political wing of the LTTE. The former LTTEers voted for the TNA and ensured its victory in the last elections and the TNA also stands for the rights of the LLTEers, he added.
Referring to a statement made by President Maithripala Sirisena who called TNA Leader R. Sampanthan best Tamil leader in Sri Lanka' s political history, Mr. Gammanpila said it was because Mr. Sampanthan supported governments each and every decision.
He said Mr. Sampanthan was the one and only opposition leader in world history who had voted along with the government for the Budget without proposing a single amendment.
Mr. Sampanthan stand bias to the government. He has done this several times. Therefore, it is obvious that he should be the best opposition leader to the government, he added.

'Gazette issued giving super-powers to a National Policy Board'
	
Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today charged that a gazette notification had been issued by the Cabinet to establish a specialised government body with powers exceeding the executive powers of the President and some more special provisions to facilitate the formulation of a National Policy on all subjects including Accelerated Economic Development.
GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said the gazette notification was ordered to be published by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and was issued on November 25 at the Cabinet.
He told a media briefing held today at GMOA Head Quarters that the board which would be managed by a government executive would not be accountable and responsible and the scope for legal action against the board was also restricted.
He warned that the government was trying to facilitate the related undertakings of the proposed Indo-Lanka Economic and Technological Cooperation Act (ETCA) through the board.
Super authorising powers are vested on a single board and an individual who will handle it. This is not healthy for the other sectors of the government. Formulating a national policy is praiseworthy and that was first proposed by the GMOA to the government. However, there should be proper and accepted way of doing such things, he said.
According to the gazette notification, the board which would cover Economic Development Areas such as manufacturing, tourism, science and technology, logistics, business and service, high-tech fisheries and high-tech agriculture shall be in operation only for a period of three years from the appointed date.
An Agency for International Trade will also be appointed by the board which will work with objectives of promoting and developing international trade of Sri Lanka, facilitating the growth of exports of Sri Lankan products and services, particularly the agricultural and fisheries products, promoting Sri Lanka as a major trade, business and logistical hub of the Indian Ocean region and serving as the agency for the formulation, implementation and co-ordination of international trade of Sri Lanka.

Italian PM Matteo Renzi resigns after heavy poll defeat
	
Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has resigned after suffering a heavy defeat in a referendum over his plan to reform the constitution.
In a late-night news conference, he said he took responsibility for the outcome, and said the No camp must now make clear proposals.
With most ballots counted, the No vote leads with 60% against 40% for Yes.
The turnout was nearly 70%, in a vote that was seen as a chance to register discontent with the prime minister.
"Good luck to us all," Mr Renzi told reporters. He said he would tell a Cabinet meeting on Monday afternoon that he was resigning, and then tender his resignation to the Italian president after two-and-a-half years in office.
Mr Renzi said the reforms he proposed would have cut Italy's bureaucracy and made the country more competitive.
But the referendum was widely seen as a chance to register discontent with the prime minister.
The No vote was supported by populist parties, and the referendum was regarded as a barometer of anti-establishment sentiment in Europe.
The populist Five Star Movement says it is getting ready to govern Italy now that Mr Renzi is resigning. "Starting tomorrow we'll be at work on a Five Star government," one of its leaders, Luigi Di Maio, said.
The movement, led by comedian Beppe Grillo, spearheaded the winning No campaign.
Opposition leader Matteo Salvini, of the anti-immigrant Northern League, called the referendum a "victory of the people against the strong powers of three-quarters of the world".
There has been an immediate reaction from right-wing leaders in Europe.
The leader of Front National in France, Marine Le Pen, tweeted her congratulations to the Northern League.
"The Italians have disavowed the EU and Renzi. We must listen to this thirst for freedom of nations," she said.(BBC)

Muralitharan was arrested by the FCID for allegedly receiving a bulletproof vehicle from the Presidential Secretariat in 2010 after being elected to parliament.
According to the FCID, he had not returned this vehicle though he had lost his seat at the general election in August last year. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

## Title: New Zealand PM John Key resigns

New Zealand PM John Key resigns
	
John Key, the New Zealand Prime Minister and leader of the National party, has resigned in a decision that has taken the country by surprise.
Key held a media conference in Wellington at 12.45pm local time, after informing the cabinet of his decision.
His resignation will be effective from 12 December, when National MPs will meet to select a new leader.
Key said he would vote for his deputy prime minister, Bill English, if he put his name forward. English briefly led the party to its worst-ever electoral defeat in the 2002 election, but has since served as a successful finance minister.
Key is widely regarded as one of the most popular prime ministers in New Zealands history. He was first elected in 2008, and recently marked his 10-year anniversary as leader of the National party.
He said stepping down was the hardest decision he had ever had to make, but there was no way he could have served a full fourth term.
This felt like the right time to go, he told reporters. Sometimes youve got to make hard decisions to make right decisions, he said, adding it was an opportunity to refresh the National partys leadership of the country and hopefully clinch a fourth term.
I think one of the reasons governments fail at that fourth-term hurdle is leaders dont want to leave, everyone says Ive seen this before. This is the chance to demonstrate newness about us.
He said he had a pretty long discussion about standing for a fourth term with his wife, Bronagh Key. I dont feel comfortable looking down the barrel of the camera and not being honest ... On a family basis, I dont think I could commit much longer than the next election.
He denied that Bronagh had given him an ultimatum, but said his leadership had come at a cost to his family. Its been a decade of a lot of long, lonely nights for her and its the right time for me to come home.
Analysis John Key kept the knife he reserved for himself perfectly concealed
Fittingly, as head of a party lauded for its ability to renew, Key edged himself out of the leadership before there was much speculation about his future
His children, Max and Stephie, had suffered an extraordinary level of intrusion along with the opportunities that came with being New Zealands first family.
In the past year, Key has had to answer to questions about his sons burgeoning career as a DJ and social media personality. Spending more time with his family was a major factor in his decision to stand down, he said.
Key said he believed the mark of a good prime minister was one who left the country in better shape than they found it.
Over time others will judge whether Ive done that. All I can say is I gave it everything I had. I have left nothing in the tank.
One of his regrets was not getting the Trans-Pacific Partnership over the line, as well as his failed bid to change the flag.
He said he considered his economic management of the country as a mark of success, even though New Zealand had weathered some crises during his government, including the Canterbury earthquake and the Pike River mining disaster. Very few countries are in the financial position were in.(The Guardian)

Port City Project: Development or disaSter
	
Coastal erosion in Bassiyawaththa, Negombo

The Port City project -stalled, suspended and recommenced-has been under public scrutiny for various reasons. Five years in the making, the project has withstood regime change, public protests and spurious criticism levelled by political parties and personalities who have changed their tunes according to election whims.
Nevertheless a group of activists who voiced their concerns over the detrimental consequences of the project have remained relentless. They still believe that the Port City project will be the greatest self-inflicted ecological hazard to Sri Lanka. The approached several environmental activists to query their stance on the project. Among them was Rev. Fr. Sarath Iddamalgoda, a Christian priest who has been a strong and vocal opponent of the project, representing the disheartened and helpless fishing community of the island, whose livelihoods will be undermined by the mega project.
Our stand remains the same, the peoples movement against the port city will continue. We supported the citizens who protested sand mining in Negombo, but we shall go beyond that. Our
		
			Rev. Fr. Sarath Iddamalgoda
			
		position has not changed; we want the project to be stopped completely. Especially after the court case was filed on the advice of the Chief Justice, fishermen of this area visited the subject Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka whom they requested to come and observe the situation for himself. 
The officials there would not know the situation here unless they observe it, Fr. Iddamalgoda said. Commenting on the Ministers assurances that the project was carried out on a strong scientific basis minimising environmental and livelihood damage, Fr. Iddamalgoda said in certain cases experience and common knowledge trump science. Scientific evidence is not always accurate; peoples traditional knowledge that has been gathered over years has to be taken into account. For instance, farmers were introduced to various new scientific developments. But this technology has only destroyed the lives of people. The same principles can be applied to fishing; technological developments wont always help. Therefore, it is very important that the minister and experts who advise him come and see whats happening on the ground level. When the Minister was involved in the Janantha Mithuro movement during his young days, he had a better understanding and respect for the people Fr. Iddamalgoda opined.

Port City still illegal -Environmentalists
Meanwhile, the members of the Environmental Monitoring Committee (EMC) appointed by the Coast Conservation Department (CCD) to oversee the environmental compliance of the Port City project
		
			Sajeewa Chamikara
			
		inspected the project site last month.
The EMC team comprises representatives from 20 government agencies, including the CCD, Central Environment Authority (CEA), Road Development Authority (RDA), Sri Lanka Land Reclamation Development Corporation (SLLRDC) with National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA).
The group had expressed its satisfaction at the projects compliance. They concluded that the reclamation and construction work is carried out according to the conditions outlined in the development permit issued by the CCD.
On the contrary many environment protection organisations believe the project is illegal. Spokesman for the Environment Conservation Trust Sajeewa Chamikara opines the project was an illegal implementation by the previous government and expressed disappointment over the present governments continuation of the project.
This project is carried out despite two cases filed in Court and amidst public protests. The government was elected on promises of good governance; the continuation of the project is a violation of the law and thereby is a violation of good governance. Not only does this project pose harm in economic terms but it also threatens the livelihood of the fishing community, the marine ecosystem as well as the coastal belt, Chamikara explained.
The initial plans for the Port City project were said to be carried out in an area of 233 hectares. According to Chamikara this was then increased to 269 hectares and finally to 271 hectares. The land that will be reclaimed for the project has been increasing. What is even more disappointing is that the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report was not carried out properly amd this report is extremely weak, Chamikara accused.

"Fishermen around the island have expressed fear and concern even before the implementation of the project. Aruna Roshantha of the All Ceylon Fisheries Union resides in Morawala, Negombo. He says sand mining activities on account of various development projects over the years had caused serious damage to the coast. "

Environmentalists say, the Port City project is carried out in contravention to the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Act. The recent report was tabled as a Supplementary Assessment Report (SEIA). The law does not provide for any supplementary reports. This is clearly illegal! Chamikara added.
A massive project of this nature implemented without a proper EIA will not only harm the environment but also destroy livelihoods. The project requires 100 cubic metres of sand dredged from the deep-sea bed for construction. The mining of such a massive amount of sand will heighten hte danger of coastal erosion. We have already seen such sea erosion in the western coastal belt
		
			Ravindra Kariyawasam
			
		including the coasts of Panadura, Angulana, Mount Lavinia, Uswetakeiyawa, and Negombo. This will also cause irrevocable damage to the coral reefs off the coast of Negombo, the coral life in Morawala, Negombo will be destroyed. The reclamation of land and sand mining will also cause changes to the currents, which may further threaten our shores
with erosion.
Environmental Scientists believe that the Indian Ocean is home to 32,000 marine species out of which a considerable portion is found in the seas surrounding our island. Meanwhile the total area of the island which measured 65,610 square km several years ago, has reportedly shrunk to 65,525 square km.
Environmentalist Ravindra Kariyawasam of the Centre for Environment and Nature Studies is convinced that with the continuation of the Port City project natural erosion will be unnecessarily augmented.
According to Kariyawasam this does not simply mean that Sri Lanka loses its land area to the sea. This type of aggravated erosion causes much more harm than meets the eye. The already depleting resources of Muthurajawela, the lagoons of Negombo, Mahawewa, Chilaw, Anawilundawa and several other lagoons in the western coast will subsequently be obliterated. This would result in the disturbance and eventual destruction of the lagoon eco-system. You can imagine what this would mean for our lagoon fisherfolk, Kariyawasam said.

Fisherfolk fear imminent disaster
Fishermen around the island have expressed fear and concern even before the implementation of the project. Aruna Roshantha of the All Ceylon Fisheries Union resides in Morawala, Negombo. He says
		
			Aruna Roshantha
			
		sand mining activities on account of various development projects over the years had caused serious damage to the coast.
This natural reef in Morawala protected us from the Tsunami. Ever since sand was extracted for the construction of highways and the port, the reef has been damaged. Do we need more evidence that sand mining will cost us our environment questions Roshantha.
Dredging activities for the Port City were re-commenced by the China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) in September within a 56 square km block that starts from 4.1 km from the western shoreline of the Negombo area.
In a statement obtained by the CHEC states the new SEIA did not grant approval for dredging at an identified site 2.1 km from the shoreline.
In Bassiyawaththa, Negombo, fishermen like Roshantha say they have already witnessed a massive vessel extracting sand off the area, dredging sand close to the shore at a distance of 2 km, despite the permit not being granted. Buoys were installed by the contractor to guide fishing vessels and keep them away from the dredging zone.
Fishermen of the area protested against this in October as they believed the move endangered their livelihood.
Sand dredger seen off the coast of Negombo

"This project is carried out despite two cases filed in Court and amidst public protests. The government was elected on promises of good governance; the continuation of the project is a violation of the law and thereby is a violation of good governance. ..."

Following the protests, Minister Ranawaka met with representatives of the fishing community. At this meeting, authorities claimed that fishermen have damaged buoys installed by the contractor, costing them a great deal, while ironically, the meeting was concluded with the government representatives saying that the fishermen never opposed the project. Minister Ranawaka who also attended the meeting had not only challenged fishermen to provide scientific evidence that the project will cause environmental damage but also had assured fishermen that they will receive compensation for the temporary losses incurred due to the project.
We dont want these bribes! Roshantha claimed. What the Minister and the Government promised fishermen has now been exposed as a complete lie. Who will save our livelihoods when the marine life is destroyed Before the election the Prime Minister promised us that this project would be stopped. This is not the change we voted for! He should tender
his resignation.

Dredging willbe carried outin approvedareas - CHEC
In the meantime, CHEC says the dredger movements can be tracked live via a website provided to the fishermen and catholic clergy which establishes the exact location of the dredger. The statement said the dredger is shown to move at 1/10th the normal speed and assured that dredging would be carried out in approved areas. Yet when contacted by the , fishermen alleged that the vessel draws towards the shore during after hours, close to a distance of 2 km.
CHEC said at present, based on representations made by fishermen regarding the existence of a fish breeding rock outcrop at a distance of 10km from the shoreline only on the approved dredging site, the Secretary to the Ministry of Megapolis requested that the dredgers be temporarily shifted to 10km and beyond, pending NARA carrying out a more extensive study on the existence of such rock outcrops.
According to Roshantha however there is a deadlier risk posed by sand mining. Although at the meeting with fishermen the government representatives had agreed that the dredging will maintain a 10 to 15 km distance from the shoreline, Roshantha says the dredger closes in about 2km from the shore each evening.
In Bassiyawaththa, located on the land that separates the Negombo lagoon from the sea, this kind of sand mining in water that is already 20 to 30m deep will take away the reinforcing layers of sand. Divers and environmentalists say the reef in Morawala, which holds the weight of the Negombo lagoon, has cracked in several places following the continuous sand mining over the years. If this continues the reef will eventually give away, as it will no longer be capable of withstanding the pressure of the lagoons water mass, the stretch of land in between or the surrounding marshy land with hard and heavy soil. Unfortunately, these factors have not been assessed in the EIA report and therefore the risk of an impending landslide has not been acknowledged.
We are asking the authorities to put an end to this hypocrisy. We are not allowed to even take a basin of sand, its illegal, because they say that it endangers our environment. So how come foreign companies are allowed to take hundreds of cubic metres of sand There are over 30,000 fishermen in Negombo alone who are directly affected by the sand mining. But the government in its hope of realising a Singaporean dream is callously ignoring our livelihoods,
laments Roshantha.

"We are not allowed to even take a basin of sand, its illegal, because they say that it endangers our environment."
Continuous sand mining has caused extensive coastal erosion in Negombo
Permit subject to conditions - CEA
The s continuous attempts to contact officials of the Oceanography Department of NARA and the CCD were unsuccessful. However, when contacted, the Director General of the CEA K.H. Muthukudarachchi commenting on the matter said the athouritys stance on the Port City project was
		
			K.H. Muthukudarachch
			
		a positive one. Although the CEA which is the legal entity charged with all matters connected with the environment on land or offshore, when questioned about the anomalies pertaining to the project, distanced itself saying that the EIA was conducted
by the NARA. 
We have laid out some 70 odd conditions prior to granting the permit. These conditions have to be met in order to minimize the environmental impact, Muthukudarachchi said. Questioned about various concerns raised by environmentalists, he said: Environmentalists can raise various issues, they think that we are doing nothing in this regard. But we have laid out our conditions for the project. He added that in the event the conditions are violated, CEA will resort to legal action. 
The conditions which shed light on a number of environmental concerns were tabled in March this year. However as Muthukudarachchi confirmed, the conditions will enable developers of the Port City project to minimize and control the adverse effects caused to the environment, though they wont prevent any possible bio-hazards.
Among the conditions specified in the permit are terms pertaining to sand mining, supply of quarry, solid and liquid waste management, archaeology, coastal conservation and even noise, traffic and
vibration impacts. 
Developers of the project will be subject to these terms which validate the permit. Nevertheless effective monitoring of these conditions by the relevant authorities and activities that appear to be contrary to the conditions raise many doubts, as was apparent during the protests carried out in Negombo against sand mining.
The understanding reached between the minister and fishermen of the area too has been disregarded. While documents, permits and other approvals are in place and appear above board, we question if the relevant ministries and departments are in agreement and the monitoring process is being properly carried out.

"When contacted, the Director General of the CEA K.H. Muthukudarachchi commenting on the matter said the athouritys stance on the Port City project was a positive one. Although the CEA which is the legal entity charged with all matters connected with the environment on land or offshore distanced itself saying that the EIA was conducted by the NARA.  "

SL to buy Chinese Xian Y20 military-cum-civil transport planes
	
Sri Lanka is to buy China-made Xian Y20 military-cum civil transport planes, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told South China Morning Post.
I have travelled around in some of the Chinese transport planes we have. They are good workhorses. Some people have raised questions about their quality but I have always said, Look, as far as I am concerned, I will always underwrite Chinese military transport planes. We will buy two more, Wickremesinghe said.
Chinas newly developed Xian Y-20 would be in contention if Sri Lanka is looking to buy more Chinese military transport craft, making it one of the first countries outside China to get the new plane.
Codenamed Kunpeng after a mythical Chinese bird, Y-20 makes China the third nation after Russia and the United States to design and develop its own heavy military transport aircraft.
Y 20 is the largest military aircraft currently in production and the first cargo aircraft to use 3D printing technology. It was officially inducted into service by the Peoples Liberation Army Air Force in July.
The only thing is getting the US federal aviation clearance, without which there might be insurance issues for Western tourists. Since our airports have excess capacity, we will try to get dual-use military planes that can also carry tourists. We are talking to the Chinese to see if we can get planes that can conform to these norms, Wickremesinghe said.
Logically it makes sense for Sri Lanka to buy strategic transport aircraft because the old ones are not serviceable in a cost-effective manner, he added.
But according to IHS Janes aerospace analyst, Ben Moores, the plane wouldnt come cheap.
The Sri Lankan Prime Minister, however, wouldnt let on which way he is swinging with fighter jets which his country is going to buy.
Although there is no war in Sri Lanka now and there is no threat from outside either, the Sri Lankan Air Force needs to replace its ageing fleet of Russian and Israeli fighter bombers and train itself to face a future threat despite the burden any new purchases will foist on the debt-ridden country. 
Colombo was expected to sign a deal to purchase up to 12 JF-17s co-developed by Pakistan and China in January. The deal was cancelled after intense diplomatic manoeuvres by India, which has been trying to sell its own Tejas to the strategically located Indian Ocean island nation.
China, India, Sweden and Russia have made offers, we are studying them, Wickremesinghe said.
Although India offered the Tejas, it was not ready at that time, as it was undergoing development and trials. Since then, a squadron has joined the Indian Air Force. But the Indian Navy has rejected the aircraft saying that it is unsuitable for use in aircraft carriers and that it has to undergo further development.
Apparently, Sri Lanka is not particularly interested in acquiring fighter jets now because there is no threat either from the LTTE or any country in the region. But it is interested in transport aircraft, especially if they can be used for military and civil purposes. Sri Lanka needs planes which can carry passengers and cargo. The island has many air fields of World War II vintage but these have remained unused because governments have not developed domestic air transport preferring to rely on road transport.
A recent report said that government is going to ask the Air Force to run a domestic airline. During the war ,the Air Force had run a service between Colombo and Jaffna on a commercial basis, replacing some private operators.(Indian Express)

A cold war going on between a senior purohita and the chief executive of a statutory body coming under his purview is one of the main topics being talked about in political circles these days.
The duo has got into the habit of turning down each others official requests out of sheer spite, they say.

The purohita had rejected on two occasions the application for leave abroad submitted by the chief executive while the latter had rubbished a list of candidates for recruitment to the institution sent by the purohita in a tit for tat move.
The chief executive had also purchased four vehicles for official use of the institution against the instructions of the purohita.
The duo carefully avoids any eye-contact with each other at the official conferences they have to attend, they say.
