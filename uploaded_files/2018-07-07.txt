A simple and low cost method  for holding PC elections
	
Provincial Council elections
?
?
It is reported in the press that notwithstanding a difference of opinion that has arisen at a party leaders? meeting regarding the forthcoming Provincial Council (PC) elections, it has been decided to revert to the ?Preference Voting? (PV) system. It is tantamount to a patent reversal of the much avowed election promise given by all political parties at the last Presidential and General elections. Pertinent it is, to note that the main plank of the late Ven. Sobhitha Thero?s campaign was the abolition of the despicable PV system.??
Whither Electoral Reforms?
The writer has submitted a comprehensive package of proposals on Electoral reforms several times during the recent past through the press with copies to the Public Committee on Constitutional reforms, Constitutional Assembly, Election Commission, President?s office, PM?s office, a few concerned party offices, civil organizations and individuals, which has been of no avail. The package addressed several important national imperatives triggering from our emerging political culture, which were not adequately dealt with even under the ?Mixed Voting? system? which went in to disarray due to several reasons.??
A simple method??
Since the issue at hand is the PC elections, I quote below the relevant extract from my package of proposals.??
?Wasteful and unproductive electoral system to be replaced by simple, cost and time-saving electoral reforms such as, substituting Preference Voting system with ?District wise party merit lists? carrying names of political professionals selected under robust eligibility criteria leading to avoidance of Bi-elections, ?Hung-Parliament? and ?Cross-overs? et al.???
Under the proposed system, the number of seats won by each contesting party will be determined by applying proportionate arithmetic to the total number of seats allocated to each District in a Province by the Elections Commission. This will ensure that every single valid vote will carry an equal value epitomizing the basic tenet of a liberal democracy.??
Key success factor
The key success factor of this proposal as mentioned above is based on proper identification and selection of candidates in merit order by the contesting parties, against a set of eligibility criteria laid down by the Election Commission in consultation with Voters? organisations such as ?Paffrel? and ?Caffe?. The first step in this direction was taken by ?Paffrel? in the form of ?March 12th Declaration? at the last elections. Now it is only a matter of improving on those criteria and regularizing them as specific eligibility criteria for all candidates. In this regard, a ?Citizen?s wish list? by the writer titled ?Criteria for selecting election candidates? was also published by the press and copies were sent to the concerned organizations. Accordingly, the contesting parties will be required to establish and execute a robust, transparent and structured interview procedure to select their candidates in merit order for each District so that the oft repeated claim that the party leader will select his ?henchaiyas? can be avoided.??
Additional advantages
Readers will appreciate that in addition to benefits arising from the removal of the PV system, the following key advantages will accrue to the candidates, system and the country at large.??
1) Simplification of the work-load of the Elections Department paving the way for election results to be announced before mid-night resulting in a tremendous saving of time, manpower and money.??
2) Since the selection of candidates in merit order is fully entrusted to the parties concerned, the campaign funds will have to be channeled through the party in a transparent manner and the candidates will be prevented from raising funds for their individual campaigns thereby absolving them from undue allegations of bribery and corruption as alleged in the infamous list of 118!??
3) The Election Commission will find it easy to monitor the campaign expenditure of parties than of individuals.??
Conclusion??
The above proposals constitute a ?Model? of our own anvil with social equality, justice, simplicity and passion for high productivity forming its ?Boiler-Plates?. Therefore, looking for examples from other countries is superfluous.??
?We appeal to all sensible citizens, academics, politicians and civil activists to carefully study the above proposal with an open mind and persuade the authorities to stop breeding more unprofessional politicians draining the resources of our country already burdened with a colossal debt portfolio and low productivity.??

Appreciation Dr. N. T. Kurukulasuriya had a large heart  !
	
It was exactly 30 years ago that my youngest son was ushered into this world by the brilliant and skillful obstetrician Dr Nisal Kurukulasuirya who was fondly known as Bunty to many.? ?
His endless compassion was equal only to his talent and capabilities as a brilliant professional in his chosen field. Warm and unassuming, he would put his patients at ease almost immediately with his large heart, and his beaming, dimpled smile.? ?
It is with deep gratitude that I remember this wonderful man who saved both mother and baby three decades ago through sheer virtuosity from a complicated pregnancy, punctuated with numerous problems.? ?
Bunty was a bright star at Royal College and in hindsight, it was my father-in-law who had the privilege of teaching this young star perhaps in rugby, Math and Physics (in that order)! With complications rife and mixed signals from different Obstetricians, my father-in-law, in his wisdom insisted that I should consult his brilliant pupil who was then the Head of the De Soysa Maternity Home.? ?
Dr. Kurukulasuriya at the helm, though very busy, was quick to see us at his old teacher?s request. He was extremely adept at his clinical assessments and having diagnosed my condition, he assured my father-in-law in his inimitable style ?Sir, this is the best place for her? with absolute confidence and knowing well that the hospital under his command was equipped to deal with such exigencies.? ?

?
At his behest, I carried at all times a ?SOS? card given to me by the hospital for any distress signals for immediate admission and surely with more than six weeks before due date, I was admitted with complications for the final episode of this adventure.? ?
I recall that morning, the theatre teeming with men in white coats and just before I slipped into oblivion from the effects of anesthesia, I was relieved to overhear that they were Bunty?s medical students from the Colombo University keen to bear witness to an unusual and complicated case study.? ?
Dr. Kurukulasuirya?s prowess and dexterity guided him to perform a flawless Classical Cesarean section to salvage a premature baby lying across, whilst navigating through life-threatening complications of major degree placenta previa that beset me; thus minimizing the risks of a potentially fatal hemorrhage to save both our lives with God?s grace.? ?
The birth of a child is a divine miracle and every mother will never forget the unparalleled experience of giving birth to her precious child with wonder and amazement and in Dr. Kurukulasuirya?s long and distinguished career he may have ushered into this world many hundreds of babies. I stand with these mothers to honour and celebrate this great man with heartfelt gratitude.? ?
Today as my son, Stefan celebrates his 30th birthday, grown in stature and pleasing God in his journey, he is a far cry from the tiny ?ET? lookalike I first beheld three decades ago. I believe, Dr. Kurukulasuriya was God?s instrument on earth and a guardian angel assigned to us to intervene in a divine miracle.? ?
?We were greatly saddened by the untimely passing away of Dr. Kurukulasuriya, but he will remain forever, our hero. Words fail us to comfort his beloved wife and his family, although the void is irreplaceable, his legacy will live on.? ?
?They shall not grow old, as we that are left to grow old: Age shall not weary them nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning, We will Remember them.?? ?

## Title: Appreciation Lakshan?s ?long rest? was a difficult experience
## Section: News Features

Appreciation Lakshan?s ?long rest? was a difficult experience
	
On the 16th of June, 2018 Chamara Lakshan Perera posted the following Facebook status update: ?Bed rest. a different and difficult experience. any way waiting eagerly to watch lio messi?s magic. 4 and half hours more.?? ?
That little note says a lot about the man. He was at the time the Editor-in-Chief of two Lake House newspapers, the daily ?Resa? and the institution?s flagship publication, ?Silumina?. That makes for a lot of hard work, but then again Chamara always worked, always worked hard. Forget ?bed rest,? it was as though he never rested. Rest, as he said was a different experience and in fact, more tellingly, a ?difficult? experience for him. It was, apparently, something alien to him.? ?
And yet, according to his friends, in his early days as a journalist, especially when he was at Rivira and Irudina, Chamara was always out of office by 4 pm, perhaps because he travelled from Matugama, but maybe that was his way of carving out personal space in an unforgiving vocation. Things must have changed after he was handed more responsibilities.? ?
?
When Chamara launched a collection of interviews in late 2014 titled ?Sanlaapa? one of the speakers, Lalkantha of the JVP, remarked that it was impossible to figure out Chamara?s political leanings from the questions he asked and from what he wrote
I don?t know why he had to bed-rest, but Chamara certainly made light of such things. The excitement of a Soccer World Cup game clearly made his ailment, whatever it was, small. I have never discussed soccer with him, so I don?t know if that note was about him being a fan of Argentine soccer or just Lionel Messi, the iconic player of that team. All I know is that Chamara loved sports and he knew a lot of stuff about lots of sports.? ?
The truth is that he was interested in a wide range of things. He wrote about them all. As a journalist, he could handle news, politics, sports or any other subject if called upon to do so. He was really good at all these things, but particularly so when it came to interviews, especially politicians.? ?
When Chamara launched a collection of interviews in late 2014 titled ?Sanlaapa? one of the speakers, Lalkantha of the JVP, remarked that it was impossible to figure out Chamara?s political leanings from the questions he asked and from what he wrote. Chamara, towards the end of the event, remarked that he did have a political position, but that this was not very relevant to the work he did.? ?
It was probably in 2004 that I first met Chamara. He was a student at the University of Colombo at the time and was working as a freelance writer for ?Lakbima?. It was not a paper I read frequently so his name was not familiar. He said he wanted to interview me for a page he did, Ahasgawwa. We met at Phoenix-Ogilvy where I was doing some part time work. We discussed Buddhism, nationalism, creative writing and advertising. I remember being impressed by the probing questions he asked to obtain detailed and comprehensive answers. We became friends.? ?
I remember him calling me about a year later to tell me that he would like to join Rivira, a newspaper that was about to be launched. I remember him saying ?I would like to work with you.? This morning however, I came across a note he had written on the third anniversary of ?Rivira?, where he says that I had urged him to join and had arranged for an interview with the then CEO Krishantha Cooray and the then Editor-in-Chief Upali Tennekoon.? ?
?
Chamara didn?t have a strong social media presence. He was fully engaged with two newspapers. He had to work seven days a week. He must have watched Iceland hold Argentina to a 1-1 draw
I knew he would be an asset. Later, when I left that company I wrote to Krishantha saying that the future of Rivira was in the hands of two young journalists, one of whom was Chamara and the other Rasika Jayakody. When I returned in 2011, Rasika had left, but Chamara was there, versatile and productive as ever. Until he left Rivira to join ?Irudina?, Chamara was a great source of strength although we worked in two different newspapers.? ?
He told me he was going to another newspaper. I remember telling him he would do well wherever he went. I wished him well. When he joined Lake House in 2015, I felt that it was not the best place for him, but then again it was better that people like Chamara were there rather than party loyalists.? ?
When he was appointed Editor-in-Chief of a new daily paper, he called me and ran the proposed names through me. He insisted that I should write. It was a privilege to write for Chamara. The space he provided was payment enough, I told him. When he was put in charge of Silumina a few weeks ago, he called and asked me to check out the new-look Silumina and tell him what I thought. Time had passed and the time for me to offer any advice to Chamara had also passed. It was kind of him to ask for my opinion for he knew much more about newspapers than I did. That?s how he was. Respectful and kind. In fact I cannot think of any journalist his age loved, admired and respected by peers, senior journalists and juniors as much as he was.? ?
Kasun Pussawella, a younger journalist and one of the best of his generation, told me that he had tendered his resignation over some matter of principle. Apparently Chamara had simply said ?I respect your decision, but malli, if people like you also leave, who will remain to make this industry thrive?? Ironically, he?s gone too, this kind, capable and energetic man who was always with a smile.? ?

Chamara didn?t have a strong social media presence. He was fully engaged with two newspapers. He had to work seven days a week. He must have watched Iceland hold Argentina to a 1-1 draw. He must have been disappointed with Lionel Messi?s ?no-show? performance that day. We don?t know if he watched Argentina lose 0-3 to Croatia on the 21st and beat Nigeria 2-1 on the 26th. He would have known that they made it to the knockouts. We know that he didn?t see France beat Argentina 4-3 on the 30th, because he suffered a sudden illness on the 26th which rendered him unconscious and from which he never recovered.? ?
Our tribe is not endowed with a lot of riches. Chamara Lakshan Perera was a giant and a gentle one too who enriched all of us. His exit has made us acutely aware of the extent of?our poverty.? ?
?
He?s gone. That?s a long rest. A different and difficult experience.? ?

Belgium eliminates Brazil, advances to semis
	
Belgium reached the World Cup semifinals for the first time in 32 years, holding off five-time champion Brazil 2-1 Friday in one of the country's greatest soccer feats.
A superb first half display by Belgium ended Brazil?s hopes of a record sixth World Cup crown as a Fernandinho own goal and a superb Kevin De Bruyne strike proved enough to win 2-1 and seal a semi-final spot.
Although Brazil roared back in the second half with a headed goal from Renato Augusto, it is the Belgians who will face France in Saint Petersburg on Tuesday.
Unbeaten in their last 15 games, Brazil?s bid for a second consecutive place in the semi-finals looked in safe hands.
But after an energetic start that saw Thiago Silva come close and Neymar show early promise, Brazil heads went down following Fernandinho?s own goal before De Bruyne?s superb strike from distance put the Red Devils in control on 31 minutes.
Late changes by Brazil coach Tite paid off as Renato Augusto?s superb header 14 minutes from time dragged the south Americans back into contention.
But as Belgian legs tired, Brazil spurned several great chances to push the match into extra-time, Augusto drilling inches wide and Coutinho skewing his effort off target from Neymar?s pass.
Courtois produced a great save in the dying minutes, tipping over a curling drive from Neymar as the Belgians ensured they will make just their second visit to the last four, 32 years after their surge to semis in Mexico.
"Just treasure it and pass it down in the generations," Belgium coach Roberto Martinez said, still seemingly in awe of what his team achieved at Kazan Arena.
Belgium took the lead after a slice of good fortune involving a pair of Manchester City teammates who were on opposing sides. Brazil midfielder Fernandinho's trailing right arm inadvertently helped Belgium captain Vincent Kompany's header land in his own net in the 13th minute.

England in semis after 28 years
	
England defied almost three decades of disappointment to move confidently into the World Cup semi-finals for the first time since 1990 as headers from Harry Maguire and Dele Alli downed a dogged but toothless Sweden 2-0.
Far more fancied England sides had failed to reach the last four in the past but Gareth Southgate's young squad powered on as they continued to make a mockery of dampened pre-tournament expectations with another impressive display in Russia on Saturday
They were set on their way when Maguire rose imperiously to head home from a corner and Alli added the killer blow after the break as England showed they are not entirely dependent on the tournament's leading scorer Harry Kane for goals.
If anything, England's hero on the day was to be found at the other end of the pitch as keeper Jordan Pickford produced three superb saves to shut out the workmanlike Swedes.
"We had to withstand a lot of physical pressure," said England coach Gareth Southgate.
"The resilience of the team and togetherness of the team today was crucial. Today our spirit was as good as theirs and our quality a little bit better."
The fans who serenaded their side at the Samara Arena stayed long after fulltime to herald the achievement, knowing that with so many of the favourites having departed, England have arguably their best chance of global glory in more than half a century.
Hosts Russia or Croatia, who meet later on Saturday and are lower ranked than Southgate's side, are all that stands between England and a first World Cup final since they won the tournament on home soil in 1966.
While England's victory was one-sided it was not easy.
Sweden had reached the quarter-finals by making life hard for supposedly superior opponents and it was easy to see why after a dour opening when England looked incapable of stringing passes together against their hardworking opponents.
It was predictable in many ways, therefore, that the deadlock was broken from a set piece.
England had laboured without reward before Ashley Young lined up a corner on the left and his curled effort was met by Maguire charging forward with conviction and barging Emil Forsberg out of his way to power a header down into the net.
That was England's eighth set-piece goal at this World Cup, but, while they are lethal from dead balls, apart from Kane they are not blessed with too many other sharp shooters.
Forward Raheem Sterling has faced some criticism over his struggles to score for England and just before halftime his doubters were handed ammunition when he was twice left alone to bear down on Sweden keeper Robin Olsen.
His blushes were saved by the linesman's flag as he fluffed the first chance, but moments later he ran through again, this time trying to round the keeper, only to be denied once more.
England were almost made to pay straight after the interval and would have been pegged back if Pickford had not produced a top-drawer save to keep out a Berg header.
The importance of the keeper's contribution was swiftly underlined with England doubling their lead in the 59th minute as Jesse Lingard's teasing cross into the box was met by Alli unmarked at the far post to head powerfully past Olsen.
England had not kept a clean sheet in their four previous matches and had Pickford to thank for ensuring they did not concede this time.
He saved superbly from Viktor Claesson before tipping a shot from Berg over the bar and that was enough to ensure Swedish hopes of reaching their first semi-final since 1994 were dashed.
"I wasn't born the last time England reached a World Cup semi-final," said Pickford.
"We have always said we would take one game at a time and we can go on and create our own history."

French President Macron?s method is motion
	
At last week?s European summit, the leaders spent most of the time discussing immigration restrictions. Yet, the Syrian rush through the Mediterraneanis now a trickle. The African migration is down by 95%.?
No wonder that Emmanuel Macron, the young (40) President of France, was frustrated. Although he spent hours trying to liberalize the consensus on immigration restrictions, he really wanted to spend most of the summit on reforming how the Eurozone works. An inner-group of 19 members uses the Euro as their currency.?
The heads of State went backwards, spending most of the summit?s time on yesterday?s problem. Macron wanted to focus on the future, to stave off a repeat of the near collapse of the Euro eight years ago.?
A month ago, he and Chancellor Angela Merkle of Germany fashioned the Meseberg Declaration, an 8-page document. The two countries make up nearly half of the Eurozone economy. The novel idea pushed by Macron and, until Meseberg, resisted by Merkel is a Eurozone budget. The smaller countries like the Netherlands and Denmark don?t see a need for it. Macron sees it as a must priority for Europe. In the end, Macron and Merkle won the tentative support of the summit. It would be funded by a financial transaction tax. There is also, they say, a need to overhaul the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) which overseas bailouts to troubled member States. Macron and Merkel also want to see a Eurozone budget with its own finance minister. (Merkel wants it to have only a small budget.)?
The next summit is in October. Macron in his usual way (he only takes four hours sleep) will argue and push to make sure that he will then get the go ahead. A lot depends on Merkle, Macron?s good buddy, still being in power. Only she can stand up to the German economists and politicians who resist the idea.?
Who is this Emmanuel Macron? He came up so fast and unexpectedly in the May election last year that we non-French only know him superficially. A new book, ?Revolution Francaise? by the long-time Economist?s correspondent in Paris, Sophie Pedder, gives us real insights. It?s a piece of writing that has dug deep into his character and activities, laced with many interviews.?
?
Before his own presidential campaign, Macron watched replays of Donald Trump?s speeches. He grasped the way in which Trump forged a link with the people, using their language and harnessing anti-establishment rage
After reading the book, it becomes clear that if anyone has the brain, the clarity and the forcefulness to drive Europe into the future it?s Macron. ?The politicians? word is exhausted,? he told Pedder. Although not a religious man, he has a moral instinct. He wants to pull Europe further together so it can live up to its founders? aim to avoid any more war on a continent that has seen more wars than any other part of the world.?
Macron is certainly not a conventional person. His whole campaign for the presidency when he shoved aside the traditional parties including the quasi-fascist but popular National Front, broke all the rules. His romance and later marriage with a woman 23 years older than him, which began when he was a schoolboy and she, his teacher, is rare in any country. It still looks strong after many years of togetherness. As Christian Dargnat, a friend said, ?He puts his own liberty above everything.? This seems to give him the conviction he needs to push his antiquated country and Europe forward.?
Already, he has done what every recent president has failed to do: persuaded the unions that they can?t avoid root and branch reforms. Many if not most thought that this was an impossible task. It impresses the Germans who are worried about France?s long time economic profligacy.?
In one interview, Macron told the author, ?If we want a modernizing agenda, we need to put together two-thirds of the Socialist Party (of which he used to be a member), all of the centrists, and part of the centre-right. That would give us a pro-European market-friendly majority in favour of modernizing the social model.? For starters 45% of his party?s members of Parliament are women.?
His attitude towards the economy has been much influenced by Indian economist Amartya Sen who won the Nobel Prize. Sen has shown that a more equal society produces more growth as well as empowering the people. Sen, Macron says, ?Structured a lot of my thinking on social justice.? One of the first measures Macron put in place was to halve the size of primary-school classes for 5 and 6-year olds in poor neighbourhoods.?
?
Macron is certainly not a conventional person. His whole campaign for the presidency when he shoved aside the traditional parties including the quasi-fascist but popular National Front, broke all the rules
Before his own presidential campaign, Macron watched replays of Donald Trump?s speeches. He grasped the way in which Trump forged a link with the people, using their language and harnessing anti-establishment rage. Of course, he?s not Trumpian. He?s more like Obama, cerebral and unflappable. Unlike Obama, he has a majority in Parliament. Macron, I think, is going to get things done. His method is motion.?

I am against restriction of media: Mangala
	
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said yesterday that under no circumstances should a website or any other media outlet be restricted, censored of suppressed no matter what they broadcast.
He said they must enjoy freedom of expression under the yapalanaya government.
"If any electronic or print media institution engages in disseminating information in an unethical manner and sling mud at individuals, do character assassinations, publishes, broadcast or telecast fabrications, misinformation and complete untruth the people at large must be intelligent enough to take only the good and reject all other contents," the minister said.
He told the media at the launching of the Presidential Media Awards scheme that the government had done its utmost to free the media from the influence of the ruling party and as a result the media enjoy unprecedented freedom as never before.
?Therefore, it is up to the media personnel to enjoy the new found freedom to the fullest and use it for the benefit of the country and themselves. I totally reject any sort of restriction on the media and I don?t like the term ?Walburu Nidahasa? or the 'freedom of the wild ass?," the minister said.
Deputy Minister of Finance and Mass Media, Lasantha Alagiyawanna said the media should be used to achieve economic progress, social cleansing and human empowerment.
He said there were many issues that troubled media personnel and in particular among provincial correspondents.
State Minister of Finance, Eran Wickramaratne said certain media outlets have their personal agendas and they use them media to reach their targets but the yahapalanaya government was committed to safeguarding media freedom at any cost.
The dialogue between Minister Samaraweera and the DM was as follows.
Daily Mirror:
It is a known fact that certain websites engaged in character assassinations, mud slinging and fabrications. Why cannot the government do anything about this?
Minister:
I don? believe in restricting or censoring the media in any manner.
Daily Mirror:
Why can?t the government take any legal action against errant websites?
Minister:
I don?t think we have legal provisions to act on this issue.
Another Journalist:
The New York Times exposure has created much controversy in and out of the country. The exposure is not good for the country.
Minister:
Yes, indeed. Two journalists have already complained that they have been threatened by those who came under scrutiny after the exposure that said former president Mahinda Rajapaksa had received US$7.6 million from China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) for his election campaign.
Journalist:
Don?t you think these exposures harm the bilateral diplomatic relations between the two countries?
Minister Samaraweera:
Of course I do. It is a very bad precedent and also an insult to Sri Lanka when leading politicians obtain bribes from a friendly country for his election propaganda.
Journalist:
A prominent Buddhist monk has also received US$38,000 from the Chinese.
Minister:
Yes, that monk has admitted that some Chinese nationals not known to him came to his temple and gave him US$38,000 in 2015 and he could not recollect who they were.
Journalist:
Mr. Rajapaksa is going to file a case against those two journalists who have allegedly given information on the deal to the NYT.
Minister:
He must not sue the NYT, not journalists. If, I were the on exposed by the NYT for this deal, I would have sue the paper for sure to get my name cleaned.
Journalist:
Chinese embassy has expressed reservations on the exposure by the NYT. Minister
Minister:
Mahinda must not attempt to get character certificates from China. He must sue the NYT if the newspaper exposure was incorrect. It is as simple as that.

Sallitivu Islet, significant for rich biodiversity, is located in the Batticaloa district in the Eastern province of Sri Lanka. It is approximately 275 metres in length and 155 metres wide and is seasonally connected to the mainland through a sand bar or sand bridge that is about 250 metres in length.? ?
All plant species observed in the island are native to Sri Lanka with a total number of 50 plant species, comprising one nationally endangered, two nationally vulnerable and four nationally near threatened plant species. The natural habitats observed in the island support a very rich bio-diversity (Ex mangroves, coastal scrub, beach and beach associated vegetation).? ?
Around March 2017, Environment Foundation (Guarantee) Limited (EFL) learnt that a tourism project was carried out on Sallitivu islet in Vakarrai under the name ?Leisure and Pleasure Pristine Eco Culture.? Due to the high ecological sensitivity of the area, EFL contacted the Batticaloa representative of the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department regarding the project and was informed that the project was yet to be approved. However, the then District Secretary of Batticaloa stated later on that the first stage of the project was almost complete and the approvals were already granted in June 2016 to continue the project.? ?
It is important to note that the government authorities responsible for the project have disregarded section 14(1) and 14(2) of the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Act No.57 of 1981 (amended) which specifies the requirement to obtain a permit from the Coast Conservation Department (CCD) prior to conducting any development activity within the coastal zone. This is the main tool used by the CCD to manage and mitigate negative impacts of development activities within the coastal zone. The Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) recognizes that an Environmental Impact Assessment / Initial Environmental Examination (EIA/IEE) needs to be conducted prior to a permit being issued for tourism structures. The permit system is an integral part of regulatory mechanism pertaining to any coastal zone, especially in the context of Sallitivu Islet which is located on an ecologically sensitive area. Thus, any development activities on the coastal zone must be carefully monitored.? ?

EFL continued correspondence with the District Secretary of Batticaloa, requesting to provide documents to confirm the approvals for the project. The District Secretary delivered the consent documents from some of the stakeholders as well as the documents pertaining to the revised budget, approved by the Ministry of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs. However, land clearance for the project was not granted by the Divisional Land Use Committee. Moreover, the Waste Management Plan prepared by the District Secretariat was not approved by the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) since the specifications for the soakage pit for waste water, nor for its location on the islet were disclosed. Even though the project had not obtained the requisite permits and authorization, the District Secretariat of Batticaloa proceeded with the project on the premise that funding will be cut off if the project was not implemented, which would otherwise render a re-application of the project.? ?
After observing all the serious implications on the environment, EFL after observing all the serious implications on the environment, expressed its commitment to extend its support to the District Secretary of Batticaloa, Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department and share its expertise and recommendations to cease any environmental and social impacts taking place as a result of the project, whilst pledging our fullest support towards sustainable tourism which is beneficial to the entire country. However, it was observed that a significant progress continued to be made on the project in complete disregard of the EIA and IEE process.? ?
Due to the failure of the government bodies to take action against the illegal tourism project, EFL filed a Writ action in the Court of Appeal on the 29th of March 2 018 (CAW 143/2018). This case was supported on the 3rd of July 2018 before Justice Padman Surasena and Justice Arjuna Obeysekera and notice was issued thereafter. The judges also granted an interim relief to prevent the respondents from engaging in any further development activities until the next court date.? ?
The Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department, the District Secretary of Batticaloa, the Central Environmental Authority, the Minister of Tourism, Development and Christian Religious Affairs and other government agencies have been named as respondents in this case.? ?
Mr. Viran Corea and Ms Sarita de Fonseka appear for the Petitioner.? ?
Notice Returnable will be on the 6th of August 2018.? ?

LNG power plant: Tender to be awarded to Chinese company
	
A team of experts have pointed out that the possible energy crisis in 2020 would take a turn for the worse, if the tender for the LNG plant in Kerawalapitiya was delayed any further.
Though the project was to be implemented this year, uncertainty remains whether it could be done because of the delay in awarding the tender.
These experts have informed the Cabinet that the power plant was expected to add 300 megawatts of electricity to the national grid.
Locally-based Lakdanavi, had submitted a lower bid for the project but the Ministry had decided to award the contract to a Chinese company. Lakdanavi is known to be carrying out power projects in different countries.

PC Polls: SLMC opposed to new electoral system
	
Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) Leader Rauff Hakeem said yesterday his party could not agree to the proposed electoral system for provincial councils.
He said this during the adjournment debate in Parliament and pointed out that the new electoral system was introduced by the present regime in haphazard manner.
Mr. Hakeem said the new system had affected the Muslims adversely and that in some local bodies where only 13 members were elected under the new system 43 were elected under the previous system.
He said the new system made voter-inducement easy. ?We saw how some candidates induced voters by offering freebies. We also saw how mosques, Buddhist temples, Hindu temples and churches were used for political activities during the local government elections,? Mr. Hakeem said.
?Sri Lanka cannot be a laboratory where electoral systems are tested but should stick to a system acceptable to all stakeholders,? he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

PR system likely due to delay in PC polls: Minister
	
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapa said yesterday the the country could return to the much criticised proportional representation system merely because of the delay in holding provincial council elections.
He said this during the debate on the provincial council electoral system in Parliament.
The minister said only political parties which represent the minority communities are opposing the new mixed electoral system. ?These parties are the ones opposing the mixed system and thus betray betray their respective communities. They are not prepared to contest on their own," the minister said.
?I have had to face adverse situations because I am supporting a national political party," he said and added that Sri Lankans should get rid of their practice of voting for candidates of their own ethnic group.
The minister said the delimitation committee should take the blame for the mess in the mixed electoral system introduced to the local government bodies. ?The delimitation committee turned down my request to call up a round table discussion to clarify the new electoral system," he also said.

SAFMA-SL condemns targeting of Lankan journalists
	
The Sri Lanka chapter of the South Asian Free Media Association (SAFMA) is very concerned about the targeting by politicians of two Sri Lankan journalists involved in internationally reporting on Sri Lankan issues published recently in the New York Times newspaper of the USA. We are concerned that, due to this individual targeting, the professional sights of these journalists have been violated. We are also concerned that the targeting is being done by senior leaders of a political group that, when it was last in governmental power, presided over a regime that saw the collective intimidation and repression of the news media industry by extreme violence.??
Singling out and publicly targeting individual professionals for the work they perform for an employer, in this case, an internationally published newspaper, is only valid if those individuals at least appeared to have seriously violated the country?s laws in any manner. In the case of the detailed news report published by the ?New York Times? newspaper of the USA, headlined ?How China got Sri Lanka to cough up a port? on June 25, 2018, the two Sri Lankan journalists concerned were the local support reporters for the American journalist team belonging to the ?New York Times?.??
As an organisation of socially concerned journalists, SAFMA-SL upholds the right of anyone to respond to any news publication in terms of public criticism of the published item or even its publisher. In terms of the law as well as professional practice, both locally and internationally, the responsibility for publication of any news product is held by the publisher and not the employee professionals concerned.??
Individual professionals are singly targeted for investigation only if there is a violation of law by the publisher that is formally considered by the authorities as serious enough to investigate and prosecute all the personnel seen as complicit. In the case of the said news report, so far, no legal authorities, either Sri Lankan or American, have thought fit to raise issues of wrong-doing, certainly not of an urgent nature that has immediate social repercussions.??
The public naming of these two journalists last week remarkably echoed that period of repression and the behaviour of politicians that heralded such massive rights violations and violence. The fact that this political criticism has sparked off a wave of similar or even worse criticism of these two individual professionals via internet social media, is indicative of an attempt to intimidate Sri Lanka?s news professional community as a whole.??

SL women subjected to sex trafficking in Afghanistan, India
	
The 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report released by the US Department of State revealed that women and girls from Sri Lanka and other countries were subjected to sex trafficking in Afghanistan and India.
The report was released by Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo at the State Department headquarters in Washington, DC last week.
?There are reports of women and girls from Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Pakistan, Iran, Tajikistan and China subjected to sex trafficking in Afghanistan. Under the pretense of high-paying employment opportunities, some labor recruiting agencies lure foreign workers to Afghanistan including from Sri Lanka, Nepal, India, Iran, Pakistan and Tajikistan; the recruiters subject these migrants to forced labor after arrival,? the report said.
It said Burmese Rohingya, Sri Lankan Tamil and other refugee populations continue to be vulnerable to sex trafficking and forced labor in India.
Meanwhile, the report said some Sri Lankan women were subjected to forced prostitution in Cyprus, Maldives, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and elsewhere.
Quoting an NGO report in 2016, the report further said some domestic workers from Indonesia, the Philippines, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have been reportedly forced into prostitution in Jordan after fleeing their employers. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Sustainable societies through cooperation
	
?
Today is the United Nations International Day of Cooperatives, and the oncoming year?s theme is ?sustainable societies through cooperation.? In a statement, the UN says that at a time when income inequality is rising around the world, it is good to be reminded that solutions to inequality do exist. The cooperative model is foremost among these solutions, since it contains aspects of sustainable development at its core and is based on ethical values and principles.?
?
According to the UN, the world?s cooperative movements will today celebrate the event and show how, thanks to their values, principles and governance structures, cooperatives have sustainability and resilience at the core, with concern for community as the seventh of their goals.? By their nature, cooperatives play a triple role -- as economic actors they create opportunities for jobs, livelihoods and income generation; as people-centred enterprises with social goals they contribute to social equity and justice; as democratic institutions, they are controlled by their members, playing a leading role in society and local communities.??
?
The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) in a statement says, the theme ?sustainable societies through cooperation? was chosen by cooperators from around the world so that local and global policymakers could learn how cooperatives contribute to more sustainable and resilient societies and work towards including cooperatives in policy processes related to sustainability issues. It says, cooperatives have sustainability in their DNA.??
The 2018 IDC theme is aligned with that of the 2018 High-level Political Forum for Sustainable Development (HLPF): ?Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies.? During the HLPF this month, UN member States will review progress towards achieving the following Sustainable Development Goals: Number 6 - clean water and sanitation; 7 - clean and affordable energy; 11 - sustainable cities and communities; 12 - responsible consumption and production; and 15 - life on land.??
The UN says cooperatives have two centuries? experience building sustainable and resilient societies. Agricultural cooperatives work to maintain the longevity of the land where they grow crops through sustainable farming practices. Consumer cooperatives support sustainable sourcing for their products and educate consumers about responsible consumption. Housing cooperatives help ensure safe dwellings. Utility cooperatives are engaged in the transition to cleaner electricity and rural access to energy and water. Worker and social cooperatives aim to provide goods and services in an efficient, planet-friendly way while creating long-term, sustainable jobs.??
In Sri Lanka, the cooperative movement was created after the 1956 social revolution and played a major role till 1977 when the globalized capital market economic system virtually swallowed up such important sectors. For 30 years from 1956, every family had a ration book which was like today?s national identity card. With the ration book the families could buy rice and other essential items at affordable prices from the nearest cooperative store.? ?
In 1990, the Canadian Cooperative Association (CCA), which promotes cooperative development around the world, was asked to participate in a cooperative thrift and credit movement called Sanasa. CCA?s role was to help establish an educational campus that would further the movement?s development of professional managers and leaders and provide practical skill training for its members. It was the beginning of CCA?s long-term relationship with a movement that has proven to be one of the most exciting and vital in cooperative and micro-finance history. CCA felt it was important for Sanasa?s activities to be documented and shared with institutions seeking a viable model of micro-finance delivery. What the team found was a cooperative movement as fresh and eager and optimistic as a child, yet wise and pragmatic as a grandmother. Although the movement faces challenges, as does any dynamic entity, the four researchers came away from that beautiful country with a renewed faith in co-operativism. They found Sanasa as a shining example of how sustainable cooperative development could help to alleviate poverty, build bridges, promote democracy and provide hope for the rural poor.? ?
At present, the Coalition Government has launched several projects for poverty alleviation. They include Enterprise Sri Lanka, the gamperaliya and gramashakthi movements which are working towards the building of a just, peaceful and all- inclusive society. We hope the cooperative movement policy and Sanasa could also be brought in to ensure a sustainable society through cooperation and a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources.? ?

Trudeau  says sorry to reporter who accused him of groping
	
The alleged incident in which Trudeau was accused of groping took place in 2000 at a music festival. Trudeau pictured above at the event (DM)??
?
Canada, (Daily Mail), 6 July 2018 -? Justin Trudeau on Thursday revealed for the first time that he did apologize to a female reporter who accused him of groping but insisted he did nothing wrong.??
The Canadian Prime Minister has faced media scrutiny in recent weeks about what happened at a charity fundraiser in Creston, British Columbia nearly 20 years ago.??
In his first direct comments on the incident on Canada Day last Sunday, the prime minister said he ?didn?t remember any negative interactions that day at all?, but on Thursday he said ?I apologized in the moment? without giving details.??
According to an unsigned editorial in 2000 in the local newspaper, the Creston Valley Advance, Trudeau apologized to a local female reporter for inappropriately ?handling? her.??
The allegation resurfaced last month after Canadian political commentator Warren Kinsella tweeted a picture of the 20 year old editorial and used the Twitter #MeToo hashtag.?
