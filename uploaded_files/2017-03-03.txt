Amana Bank December in red as one-off impairment provision hurts performance
	
Amana Bank PLC for its October-December quarter reported a loss of five cents a share or Rs.60.8 million from a net profit of Rs.37.4 million recorded during the same period from a year ago, the interim financial accounts released to the Colombo Stock Exchange showed.?
The performance was impacted by a one-off impairment of Rs.149.2 million while the growth in loans also slowed as a result of tighter credit conditions during the period. ? ?
?Although the one-off impairment has had an impact to our profits, the net assets were not affected as a result, due to such losses being captured in the bank?s reserves previously and set off against profits in the fourth quarter,? said the bank?s Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Azmeer in a post-earnings release.?
But the impairment is a provision made against the profit in view of a possible credit loss and such profit is added to the retained earnings.?
Since Amana Bank has a negative retained earnings due to previous losses, any new profits made will reduce the cumulative negative balance in the retained earnings, thus the net assets improves.?
For the year ended December 31, 2016, the bank reported earnings of Rs.40.6 million or three cents a share, down 74 percent.?
Amana is the first Lankan Sharia-compliant lender operating on the non-interest-based banking model with an asset base of Rs.54.3 billion, up little under 14 percent.?
The bank in January received the Central Bank nod to delay its core-capital enhancing requirement to June 30, 2017 from the earlier January 1, 2017 on the grounds that the bank is in talks with a fund manager to infuse fresh capital in return for a stake in the bank.?
The bank is negotiating a deal with Islamic Corporation for The Development of the Private Sector (ICD), fund manager of IB Growth Fund (Labuan) LLP ? (IBGF) for a proposed issue of shares. However, the bank must increase its core capital base up to Rs.10 billion by January 1, 2018.?
The bank?s Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratios weakened to 10.4 percent and 10.8 percent, respectively from 12.0 percent and 12.4 percent a year ago. The minimum regulatory requirement for each is 5.0 percent and 10.0 percent.?
In 2016, the bank grew its loan book by 16.2 percent or Rs.5.4 billion to Rs.38.7 billion. The net interest margin remained unchanged at 3.6 percent.?
The deposits grew by 21.8 percent or Rs.8.4 billion to Rs.46.9 billion.?
As at December 31, 2016, Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad, AB Bank in Bangladesh and the Islamic Development Bank based in Saudi Arabia together held a 38.5 percent stake in Amana Bank.?

Anuruddha says Ranjan gave letter to extend permit
	
Joint opposition MP Indika Anuruddha today claimed that while pointing fingers at him about illegal sand mining, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake had issued a letter to the Gampaha District Secretary asking that the sand mining permit of one of his supporters be extended.
The MP said the deputy minister was attempting to cancel soil and sand mining permits of SLFP supporters in Divulapitiya and to give them to UNP supporters.
?More than 200 people are engaged in sand mining and operating stone quarries in Divulapitiya legally. But the deputy minister is accusing me of illegal sand mining to take political revenge. It is up to the Geological and Mines Bureau and the district secretary and not the politicians to look into the malpractices regarding sand mining. The deputy minister is trying to give permits to UNP supporters and his relatives while pretending to protect the environment. I have written evidence and photographs to prove his interference in these matters,? he said.
The MP said the deputy minister was making false allegations against him and his family members and added that they were engaged in the business with permission obtained legally.
He said he expected the President would not allow the deputy minister to cancel the permits issued to SLFP supporters and give them to UNP supporters because they were carrying out a legal business with payments made to the government. (Ajith Siriwardana)

?Be Bold? this Int?l Women?s Day; secure your financial future with NDB Wealth
	
With the International Women?s Day only a few days away, the time to ?Be Bold For Change? is now ? and what better way to take that big leap towards ultimate financial freedom and parity than finally taking charge of your own financial future.
?Since 2017?s theme for International Women?s Day is #BeBoldForChange, the boldest step you can take as a woman is undoubtedly securing your own financial future. So, empower yourself by actively taking control of your financial planning,? advised Christina Wesley, a financial adviser with NDB Wealth.
In fact, the need for smart financial planning is even more relevant today despite woman now enjoying a greater degree of hard-won independence. This is because of the lack of corresponding parity in terms of earnings, savings, etc., which means that true financial freedom is still an elusive ideal.?
However, one way to circumvent the many obstacles faced by women, such as lack of equal pay or having to spend fewer hours at work because of taking care of children or having to take maternity leave, is to effectively utilize financial planning tools to not just accumulate savings but actually use them to generate a greater degree of sustainable wealth over the short and long term.
Wesley said, ?Sri Lankan women also have to confront the troubling reality that, while they typically have longer lifespans than men, with an average life expectancy of 77 years, they are often paid a lower wage than men.??
She also commented that Sri Lankan women often take on the additional duty of caring for aging or ailing parents and even relatives, as well as helping those in need in their immediate communities, which adds a further burden that taxes their career, finances, etc.
?This leads to an erratic career that is also interrupted by maternity leave, etc., which is an added reason for women getting less pay. So, what is needed is a ?bold? change where you think out-of-the-box and consider innovative financial planning alternatives rather than traditional bank savings accounts and fixed deposits. For example, ?Wealth Plans? by NDB Wealth can help you to truly optimize your savings, especially since you may only have very limited time and resources to do so,??
recommended Wesley.?

Calls for resignation or recusal of US Attorney General grow
	
?
Attorney General Jeff Sessions met with Russia?s ambassador twice last year during Donald Trump?s campaign run, but claimed during Senate confirmation hearing he ?did not have communications with the Russians? in his capacity as an adviser to then-candidate Trump. ??
Despite being asked by Senator Al Franken about contacts between Trump?s campaign and Russian officials, Sessions declined to mention his private conversations with Sergey Kislyak during the Republican National Convention in July and subsequently in his office in September. ??
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Thursday Attorney General Jeff Sessions should recuse himself from investigations. ?
The growing chorus of Democratic lawmakers calling for Sessions?s resignation or recusal marks the most serious demands yet to remove Sessions. ??
The talks came at the height of what U.S. intelligence officials say was a Russian cyber campaign to influence the presidential race.Sessions released a statement late Wednesday night in which he said he ?never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the [Trump] campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.? ??

Even in Europe, there are postponements of local elections  - EU Ambassador
	
The European Union Ambassador, Tung-Lai MARGUE, in an interview with the Daily Mirror, outlines that the current government is on the right track and has made many improvements. He also articulates the EU position on the GSP + trade facility and future cooperation. Excerpts of the interview follow.
How do you look at the present status of relations between the European Union and Sri Lanka? ?
We all know there has been a tremendous improvement in our relationship since 2015. The fact is that these relations were not very good earlier. It was very difficult to find areas of cooperation. The improvement in relations has very much to do with the new government that came into power with the agenda for reforms. You know the EU has been supporting this government. We continue to support it for further reforms. We believe this government has made progress in a number of areas. There have been a lot of improvements. There still need to be further steps taken in a number of areas. Fundamentally, they are on the right track. This has had a positive impact on our relationship. There has been support from the highest level - the European Heads of European institutions and the Foreign Affairs Ministers. We are consolidating our policy dialogue, which is an important element. This is not just people meeting and chatting. Trade, of course, is an important element. It is connected to GSP plus. Development cooperation is also an important element. This is taking place in a structured way. ?
We are close partners. We really hope that in the coming months, a number of commitments that have been made will be realized. ?
How do you specifically analyse the performance of the government in terms of fulfilling pledges made to the international community and others? ?
Well, it is a process. It is a difficult process without any doubt. You know there are a number of challenges. Constitutional reforms are among them. However, we expect that in the context of international forums such as the UN and the commitments made by the government which cosponsored the resolution, it will deliver on these commitments to its people. All these commitments are made for the people of Sri Lanka and for reconciliation, so that there is no reverting to war or conflict. ??
The government is to seek an extension of the timeline for the implementation of these commitments. Will the EU support it? ?
It is not for me to say what the position of the EU will be. This is still under debate. We are starting the process in Geneva. What I would like to say is that this government has not had a lot of time to put into place the commitments mentioned in the resolution. Perhaps the timeline was overambitious. But I am quite sure the outcome will be positive. There is no way to make a U-turn. ?
?
?
"In the coming years, I am quite sure there will be tremendous development in trade between the EU and the countries in the region here"
?
How hopeful are you that this government will deliver on those lines? ?
?You can see things in two ways. I think you can look at the glass as being half empty or half full. We believe it is half full. We believe more progress on issues is in the pipeline. There have been a number of improvements that we have noted, particularity in terms of legislation and the ratification of a number of international conventions. That is very welcome.?
The Office of Missing Persons is a good element, although it has not been implemented. There are a number of positive signals. We would like the constitutional reforms to proceed because these were part of major commitments made by the President when he campaigned. These are also commitments made by the coalition government. What is so important is that they address the key issues that need to be looked at if the country wants to have a prosperous future in terms of devolution, the role of the presidency and electoral reforms. These elements are key components in terms of ensuring reconciliation. ??
When it comes to the constitution-making process, how does the EU cooperate with the government? ?
First of all, this is the role of the government. They have ownership of it. Whenever they request assistance, we can help in terms of capacity building and expertise. Beyond that, is for the government to do. ?
We have observed stark policy differences between the two parties- one headed by the President and the other by the Prime Minister - regarding the contours of the new Constitution. How do you look at it? ?
I remain optimistic. Yes, we are reading and learning of things that can sometimes be surprising. I know the complexity of internal policy in this country is high. It is clear that coalition parties sometimes have divergent views. It needs strong leadership. It is the case with trade policy. Certain parties are more for liberal economic approaches, whereas others want to protect existing rights in certain areas and the policy is less clear on what is to be done to State-owned enterprises. ?
There are announcements that Sri Lanka is likely to get the GSP plus benefit. There are commitments made by the government in this regard. How far has the government implemented these commitments to secure the facility? ?
As you know, the European Commission has given the green light to the request by Sri Lanka to get the GSP plus. But it is not the end of the process. There has very recently been a request for a two-month extension of the period in order that things may be assessed more carefully by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. So, it is for these two bodies to make a decision in the coming weeks. There are areas where we would like to see further progress. The European Parliament is eager to look at the outcome of the UN resolution. This will take place before the end of the assessment period. ?
	Tremendous improvement in EU-SL relations under new Govt.
	
	
	There are still areas needing further progress
	
	
	The Govt. is on right track
	
	
	Remains positive that Sri Lanka will get GSP?
	
?
What is the period actually? ?
It is up to mid-May. The European Parliament and the Council have to say whether they are in agreement with the Commission?s position. ??
?
?
"The European Commission has given the green light to the request by Sri Lanka to get the GSP plus. But it is not the end of the process?"
?
There are 27 international conventions to be ratified by the government of?
Sri Lanka. ?
These are to be ratified and implemented. These are conventions applied to all countries which apply for the GSP + benefit. This is not something we have tailored specifically for Sri Lanka. These are conditions every country wanting to get GSP plus agrees to fulfil. ?
Is the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act to be replaced with a new counter-terrorism law as part of them? ?
It is part of a key convention. If you look at the international obligation there, it is not that the convention prohibits the government from having counter-terrorism measures or provisions. It is allowed because you know that terrorism is a key threat to a number of countries, not solely for Sri Lanka. The matter is not about having measures. These measures need to be proportionate and respect key aspects of human rights, including how suspects should be handled, detained and produced for trial. These are the kinds of elements we are looking for. ?
The government has promised to change the Prevention of Terrorism Act in accordance with the international standards on human rights. We have a formal commitment from the Prime Minister that this will be happening with the agreement of the Sri Lankan Parliament. ??
In your analysis, how beneficial will the GSP+ be for Sri Lanka? ?
Well, I think it is obvious that if you get it, you will be allowed to export to the world?s largest trading block without any tariffs on your products apart from a few agricultural products. It is going to be a tremendous advantage. You need to realize that there are only eight countries in the world that presently have GSP plus. I am sure that Sri Lankan entrepreneurs will take advantage of it. This does not mean that they will not have to put in all the effort to be at the highest level of phytosanitary and sanitary conditions. These are standards that need to be respected. ??
How do you look at the total economic potential of the EU in the current context, in which it is embroiled in its own problems with one country leaving it and some others threatening to leave? ??
So far, there is only one certainty. That is Brexit. Other elements are parts of political debates. I do not see a major risk of other countries leaving the EU. What is clear is that even with the departure of the UK, the EU remains a very important player at the international level. You talk about countries leaving. I also see countries that are waiting to enter the EU. This also needs to be considered. Bosnia and Serbia are two examples.?
What is the total economic potential of the EU in the context of new emerging economic powerhouses in the world? ?
You should not underestimate the capacity of the EU enterprises in certain key areas. We lead in terms of research and new technology. In the coming years, I am quite sure there will be tremendous development in trade between the EU and the countries in the region here. We ?have just concluded an FTA with Canada. I also understand that Japan and Mexico are very keen to conclude FTAs with the EU. ??
The new government is hailed by some sections of the international community for restoring democracy. Elections are a key element of democracy. However, the local government elections have been postponed. What is your position on it? ?
Even in Europe, there are postponements of local elections. I am not trying to interfere with the decision-making process of Sri Lanka. Obviously, if there has been a commitment by this government to hold local government elections, it should take place in the interests of democracy. My role here is not to say what the reasons are and what should be done. ?

## Title: Fitch affirms Ceylon Dollar Bond Fund at ?B+f/S5?

Fitch affirms Ceylon Dollar Bond Fund at ?B+f/S5?
	
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Ceylon Dollar Bond Fund?s international fund credit quality rating at ?B+f? and fund market risk sensitivity rating at ?S5?. The fund is managed by Ceylon Asset Management (CAM). ??
The affirmation of the ?B+f? international fund credit quality rating is driven by the weighted average rating factor (WARF), the fund?s rating distribution and its investment guidelines. The fund has a limited investment space, as it only invests in US dollar bonds issued by the government of Sri Lanka (B+/Stable), licensed banks in Sri Lanka and Sri Lankan corporates that are rated by an international rating agency. This restricts potential investments to 15 listed issuances totalling around US $ 10 billion as well as Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) of around US $ 4 billion. SLDBs are unlisted, unrated US dollar bonds issued by the government domestically. ?
The affirmation of the Fund Market Risk Sensitivity Rating is driven by the market risk factor as well as Fitch?s consideration of qualitative factors, such as the fund manager?s ability to extend duration above current levels if it sees fit. The rating also reflects Fitch?s conservative assumptions about potential volatility in emerging market debt. ?
Asset credit quality: The fund?s portfolio comprises of four bonds - all rated ?B+? - that have been issued by the entities detailed above and is mainly exposed directly to government and to government guaranteed debt. The fund currently has a large cash balance (19 percent of portfolio), which the manager expects to invest in the near-term and maintain around 5 percent-6 percent of the portfolio in short-term US-dollar fixed deposits in a licensed commercial bank in Sri Lanka. ?
Concentration: The portfolio is concentrated and has a large exposure to Sri Lankan sovereign risk. The concentration risk is a structural feature given the limited opportunities in the fund?s investment universe. Fitch has conducted stress tests on the target portfolio. Based on its analysis, Fitch believes the fund has considerable capacity to withstand negative rating migration in its investments before it would be downgraded to the ?CCC? category. ??
Portfolio sensitivity to market risk: The Fund Market Risk Sensitivity Rating is based on an analysis of the fund portfolio?s interest rate and spread duration. Based on the fund?s market risk factor alone, it could achieve a ?S4? Fund Market Risk Sensitivity Rating. However, in affirming the rating at ?S5?, Fitch has also taken into consideration wider market conditions - such as potential volatility in emerging market debt - in its rating decision as well as recognising that the fund manager does have discretion to extend duration above current levels if it sees fit. ?
According to Fitch?s criteria, funds rated ?S5? are considered to have high sensitivity to market risk. On a relative basis, total returns or changes in net asset value are expected to experience extreme variability across a range of market scenarios due to substantial exposure to interest rate, credit spread and other risk factors. ??
The fund currently has a weighted-average life of 1.3 years due to the large cash balance it maintains in short-term deposits. The fund will rely on secondary market liquidity to meet large redemption requests. However, it has access to an overdraft facility of up to 10 percent of assets under management and requires 14 days? notice on redemptions above 3 percent of the fund. On the asset side, it holds only a limited proportion of outstanding debt issues, all of which are listed on the Singapore Exchange. ?
The fund is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka under the Unit Trust Code, 2011. Deutsche Bank Sri Lanka, a branch of Deutsche Bank AG (A-/RWN/F1), is the trustee. ?
CAM is 21 percent-owned by Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Limited (SLIC, B+/Stable), 69 percent by Ceylon Capital Trust (Pvt.) Ltd and 10 percent by Commercial Credit and Finance PLC (CCF). Fitch believes CAM has shareholder support, but a key challenge will be demonstrating sustained growth in assets under management. The Ceylon Dollar Bond Fund is a key component of its growth strategy. ??
CAM has been managing funds since 1999. The current management team has been in place since 2005 and SLIC and CCF invested in the business in 2010 and 2013, respectively. ?

Hybrid Court not politically feasible: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today that a hybrid court was not politically feasible and as such a feasible alternative should be found.
He said this at the opening of the National Law Week organized by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka in Colombo this morning.
?Setting up a hybrid court is not politically feasible because such a move would need a referendum. Against this back drop, how can we fulfil the expectations of the international community? Let?s get together and think of a feasible alternative for such a court,? he said and requested the judicial experts to help this Government to find a viable alternative. (Yohan Perera)

Lankan admits killing his roommate in Kuwait
	
A Sri Lankan man was arrested yesterday for murdering a compatriot woman by setting her on fire while she was sleeping inside an apartment shared by them in Kuwait, the Arab Times reported.
In a press statement issued by Ministry of Interior, the General Department of Public Relations and Security Media explained that, when the Operations Room of Ministry of Interior received information about a flat on fire, security men rushed to the location with paramedics and firefighters.
A woman who was inside the burning flat was rescued and referred to Babtain Hospital due to the serious burns she sustained.
However, she eventually died. After firefighters extinguished the fire, security men examined the location and questioned witnesses, who revealed that they heard the victim shouting for help but were unable to help her because of the heavy smoke and fire. They revealed that she was living in the flat with a Sri Lankan man.
When security men tried to find the man, they realized he was missing. After intensive investigations, they managed to track him down and noticed that he had sustained burns on his hands and feet. When questioned about it, he said the woman had committed suicide by setting herself on fire and that he sustained the burns while trying to rescue her.
However, security men were not convinced by his testimony and further interrogated him. He eventually confessed that he poured highly inflammable liquid on her while she was sleeping and then set her on fire.
In the process, he sustained the burns but he managed to run away. The suspect was arrested and referred to the concerned authorities for necessary legal action.

Le Pen loses EU immunity over IS atrocity tweets
	
?
BRUSSELS AFP March2, 2017- The European Parliament on Thursday lifted French far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen?s immunity from prosecution over her tweeting of images of Islamic State atrocities. ??
The move paves the way for France to pursue a case against the far right National Front leader, after prosecutors launched a probe in 2015 over the graphic pictures, which included the decapitated body of US journalist James Foley. ??
??The result is clear, a big majority is in favour of the lifting of immunity,? acting parliament speaker Dimitrios Papadimoulis said. ??
The ruling is effective immediately for Le Pen, a National Front MEP, European Parliament officials told AFP. ??
But the decision concerns only the tweets, and not a separate probe into allegations that Le Pen misused public funds when hiring a parliamentary aide, they said. ??
The development is the latest twist in France?s dramatic presidential election campaign, coming a day after rightwing candidate Francois Fillon vowed to continue his bid for power despite the fact he is to be charged over his own fake jobs scandal. ??
Le Pen addressed the tweets in 2015 to a French television journalist who had likened her party to the jihadist group.?

Mahendran insisted on Rs.10bn bid instead of Rs.2.6bn: Dr. Aazin
	
Former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran had recommended that the Rs.2.6 billion bid made at the bond auction be ignored and the Rs.10 billion be accepted instead, Central Bank Statistics Department Additional Director Dr. M.Z.M. Aazin today told the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) inquiring into the CB bond issue.
He testified that the documents relating to these recommendations had not been submitted to the Parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) when it inquired into this matter.
Dr. Aazin said the former governor who visited the auction once, had returned for the second time one and half hours later and asked about the details of the Bond sale and inspected the ?Bid Sheet?.
He told the Commission that all Central Bank Directors including him expressed their objections to the instructions given by the then governor Mahendran but they kept mum after the Deputy Governor told them that Mr. Mahendran was not keen to change his stance.
Dr. Aazin?s evidence was led by Senior Deputy Solicitor General Priyantha Navana who assists the Special Commission comprising Supreme Court Judges K. T. Chithrasiri and Prasanna Jayawardane and former Deputy Auditor General V. Kandasamy. (Manopriya Gunasekara and Ranjan Katugampola)

Ragging at Universities : Grave Human Rights Violation
	
Reaffirming several reports published in the ?recently highlighting physical ragging to be intrinsic to the university subculture, fifteen students from the Peradeniya University were apprehended recently on grounds of brutally ragging eight freshers. Despite our effort to expose the severity of ragging in several universities in the past few weeks, ragging is unabatedly perpetuated. ?
Peradeniya University?is in the limelight once again for ragging
A group of freshers had been taken to a solitary house in Megodakalugamuwa by fifteen, second year students of the Agriculture Faculty of the Peradeniya University, who sexually abused and tortured the victims. When the place was raided the perpetrators were caught in action. The victims were found stripped naked. There are photographs and videos of the rag that took place. ??
Acting on an anonymous complaint the senior student counsellor of the Agriculture faculty and Marshalls had gone to the rented house in a remote area three miles away from the university to discover the horrendous manner in which freshers were ragged. Thereafter police assistance was sought and the victims were hospitalised. The fifteen suspects were further remanded yesterday till March 16 under the orders of the Kandy Chief Magistrate.
?
Physical ragging?still in operation
The Daily Mirror has already revealed the extent of the physical, sexual, mental and verbal ragging prevalent in State universities through accounts we received from lecturers, parents and students of the Colombo University, Sabaragamuwa University, Ruhuna university and the Rajarata university. Their grievances have not still been addressed. We have received detailed accounts from students subjected to ragging. If they boycott the seniors? activities or not comply with their rules, freshers are not merely ostracised but also humiliated, abused, threatened and physically attacked. One female student under conditions of anonymity said how male students were beaten when the female students refused, or were reluctant to obey the seniors? orders. Strong willed students have surrendered to the seniors on grounds that the university administration has not taken adequate action to stop the rag when they complained.?
?
	?Students are afraid that they might be forced to drop out of university
	
	
	?Lecturers should go beyond their comfort zones to win ?the confidence of students and help them lodge complaints
	
	
	?We hope the recent enlightens the VCs, Deans, lecturers and student counsellors
	
?
?From a students? perspective they are afraid to complain because the backlash?
Prof. Mohan De Silva, the Chairman of the University Grants Commission
Prof. Mohan De Silva, the Chairman of the University Grants Commission said that without anyone coming forward and complaining, action cannot be instituted against culprits. It is true that people can make false complaints especially if the complainant is completely anonymous to the authorities. However, from a students? perspective they are afraid to complain because the backlash can outweigh the positive outcome. The university authorities should look into such complaints whether or not their credibility is ascertained as the present situation is so dire that anonymous complaints cannot be regarded as untrue. ?
Samantha Vithanage, a third year Management student at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, who initiated an anti-ragging campaign, was murdered at a meeting on ragging in 2002. There have been incidents where anti-raggers and those who complained have been assaulted, harassed or acid thrown onto them. ?
Students are afraid that they might be forced to drop out of university if they don?t adhere to the policy of the irrational and sadistic raggers. The Daily Mirror learns that this fear has compelled many to participate in the recent protests against SAITM though the students did not personally believe in the cause the protests were staged against. The university sub culture which perpetuates ragging does not appreciate the opinion of the individual. ??
?
?
"Their silence is the raggers? victory. When speaking to students we were quite surprised to note their submissiveness"
?
Deans and lecturers of certain faculties are equally complicit in perpetuating ragging. They may categorically state that ragging is not accepted and is prohibited. But behind the closed doors of lecture halls, canteens and hostels grave human rights violations take place. Several reports we received were from individuals who had complained to the university authorities though their complaints have not been effectively looked into. ?
Lecturers should not limit themselves to merely advising students on why they should not accept rags. Instead lecturers themselves should go beyond their comfort zones to win the confidence of the students and help them lodge complaints. Freshers themselves need to complain and pursue action against the offenders. Their silence is the raggers? victory. When speaking to students we were quite surprised to note their submissiveness. They believe adherence to the illogical policy of the seniors? to be essential to survive in the university. This also raises the concern as to whether our youth are capable of standing on their feet. ?
?
?
Ragging is crippling our youth who have strived to enter State university. The violence encountered at the university has made many disillusioned and many have dropped out. Students are not ?ragged? in certain faculties but this does not mean that freshers are independent. Seniors continue to interfere with their lives and intimidate them. The severity of ragging is escalating. Raggers have found ways to continue their schemes by blindfolding the university administration. They have become trickier and more manipulative. A torture house was discovered recently and the whole country was shocked and dismayed. However, this is not the only instance of extreme brutal and downright deplorable ragging. ??
Student counsellors and Marshalls in certain faculties have been powerless to put an end to or control the situation. We are yet to see any positive signs of ragging being wiped out though there are significant steps being taken to curb it. We hope the recent torture house enlightens the Vice Chancellors, Deans, lecturers, student counsellors and other staff members of all universities of what they may have overlooked or ignored in their universities, and take appropriate action. ??
?
?The suspects will either be suspended or expelled?
Prof. Upul B.Dissanayake - Vice chancellor of the Peradeniya University
Speaking to Daily Mirror ?Prof. Upul Dissanayake, the Vice Chancellor of the Peradeniya University said the suspects would ?either be suspended or expelled after the incident was inquired into. ?At the moment the suspects are in remand custody. They will be charged under the Anti-ragging Act. We have suspended the fifteen students indefinitely. In the meantime we are appointing an inquiry board and we will conduct a proper inquiry at the end of which they will be punished according to the offence. They will be either suspended or expelled,? he said. ?
?
"Within the university premises there is no way of ragging students. This is why they have taken a new initiative to go somewhere else"
?
He added that there were videos and photos of the physical rag that took place. ?But we are not divulging them because they will be used before courts,? he said. ?
?Within the university premises there is no way of ragging students. This is why they have taken a new initiative to go somewhere else, away from the university. There are counsellors, proctors, deputy proctors, and the staff who are all vigilant and therefore they can?t rag students within the premises,? he said. ?
When asked if lectures were conducted as usual, he said that the university functioned though the second year students of the Agriculture faculty have been requested not to come to the university. ?Lectures are conducted as usual, but due to the SAITM issue the medical faculty is not functioning. We have asked second year students of the Faculty of Agriculture not to come to the university. We have made them out of bounds because of this particular incident,? he added. ?
?
?We can?t use violence to change students? perception?
Lahiru Weerasekara- Convener of IUSF
In his comments to the ?Lahiru Weerasekara, the convener of the Inter University Students? Federation said as the IUSF they opposed any form of abuse within or out of the university. ?People ask why we don?t get onto roads and demonstrate, but this is not a problem we can solve in that manner. We have a programme to prevent and eradicate ragging in universities,? he said. ?
?We hope to have in-depth discussions with students and lecturers to solve this problem. Ragging is not found only in universities, but also in certain schools, in the army, police and offices. We can?t use violence to change students? perception. It can be changed through knowledge and then we can develop brotherhood,? he added. ?
Actions taken since?the latest incident?
Consequent to the Daily Mirror recent incident, the University Grants Commission has set up an online complaint mechanism to complain on any form of ragging, intimidation or harassment. It can be accessed through http://ugc.ac.lk/rag/ and the victim?s? confidentiality is maintained and the site promises to act promptly. Complaints can be made to the UGC through their hotline 0112-123700 and 0112-123456. President Maithripala Sirisena has asked the IGP to coordinate with university authorities to take action against ragging.?

Diary of a fresher and the tragedy of the University system
The following is an account sent by a first year university student
We enter university at 7am, in our long skirts, blouses, rubber slippers and plaits with a knot at the end, to simply commence the rag. I did try to avoid the morning rag, but they note you, single you out and your rag merely gets worse.
We are verbally abused on a frequent basis, we are forced to eat from one rice packet in groups of six and we are forced to do numerous tasks that we wish not to at the raggers bidding.
My friend and I avoided the lunch rag on the first day of university, but as we were going to class we got caught. A group of seven male raggers scolded the two of us in Sinhala filth; they forced us to look into their eyes while they yelled at us. I just felt a sudden surge of anger, I am 21 years this year, and we have waited for university to open for more than a year, why should we tolerate such hate for no reason. Some people even had the nerve to say that the rag is fun and I will surely enjoy it, but the rag is just an excuse for the frustrated to spew hate at the innocent. We are forced to know everyone?s name and village, but I honestly cannot make friends or let alone remember names under the pressure.
?
?
"I stood up to wash my hands in the jam-packed almost stuffy canteen. A ragger who clearly saw that I had just eaten directed me to another table to eat again"
?
On the first day in the interval I was confused because I knew the rag was in the canteen, I tried to tell many people that we do not have to go to the canteen. But, my fellow strong willed batch mates simply kept walking into the lion?s mouth. If we all refused to go into the canteen, there is no way that they can rag us. My friend and I did walk away from the canteen, but a ragger found us and said that if we do not go to the canteen they would make the rag for our batch worse. We had to comply.
I was in a group of six, and we had to share a rice packet. The boys are not allowed to sit and eat; they have to eat though, while standing. I ate in that group of people that I hardly knew yet. I did not fuss because I was scared that they would make me do something worse if I did go against them. My friend though, had beef and rice, and people in our table said that they did not eat beef. She then ate it alone in her lunch box. A ragger suddenly came up to her and said, ?ubata load da?. She completely froze. He told her to stop eating; my group of 6 had almost finished the rice packet. There were some oily capsicums that were half eaten, in the rice packet, we were almost going to throw the packet away, but my friend was forced to eat the capsicums as a punishment for eating alone.
I felt so sad and powerless. I stood up to wash my hands in the jammed packed almost stuffy canteen. A ragger who clearly saw that I had just eaten directed me to another table to eat again. The new group that I went to had almost finished eating, and the ragger was screaming into my ear saying, ?Eat! Eat! Eat!? and I had to eat the scraps from that rice packet. I honestly felt my bile rising. Another girl who has high blood pressure was yelled at by two raggers, because she laughed while eating.
After the canteen rag, I went to the wash room. A group of raggers saw me going and started yelling at me for no reason. Since, I was wearing a T-shirt instead of a blouse with my skirt, a sleazy ragger came up to me and said that he could see everything underneath my shirt. I truly felt disgusted. After I came out from the wash room, he once again reminded me that he could see everything underneath my clearly opaque shirt. We cannot even go to the washroom in peace.
My friends and I formed a group and planned to escape the evening rag, which was after lectures. But, many declined to join us and said that they would rather face the rag and that they were scared to escape. There are many exits in university, other than the main gate, that we could have escaped from. But, after our final lecture the raggers had positioned themselves in every exit path.
?
?
"The new group that I went to had almost finished eating, and the ragger was screaming into my ear saying, ?Eat! Eat! Eat!??
and I had to eat the scraps from that rice packet. I honestly felt my bile rising"
?
But, our group still stood strong and we passed the raggers who were yelling at us and left from the main gate. We did feel triumphant, but it was for a trifling moment. We got messages from unknown numbers saying that the raggers would be waiting for us in the morning, and we better get ready. Some batch mates told us that their rag got worse and that some boys got hit because of us. I do not know the validity of these comments, but I know that my batch had the choice to join us and leave the rag too. The raggers also asked our batch to corner the 7 girls who left the rag.
A senior told me it was better to comply with the rag, otherwise we get left out from university activities and it becomes difficult to join clubs and sports. This repercussion is unfortunately how the raggers perpetuate the submissive mentality within us.
Our fear gives the raggers their power and authority. If we are united as a batch we can defeat the rag. But, that would be a utopian reality, because many are afraid to stand against it and some even enjoy the rag and act as messengers to the seniors.
Some even believe that the rag makes us stronger. But, it truly makes us weaker as we become submissive to a completely false authority. I feel like the rag culture has completely warped our mentality. It has made us both weak and disunited.
The administration knows what exactly is going on, however they simply turn a blind eye towards it. There are a few lecturers who are completely against the rag and they tell us to stand up for ourselves. The university hands out pamphlets on numerous occasions stating the anti-rag laws, however nothing is being implemented. Our precursor batch complained about the rag, and this simply prolonged the rag. It is also difficult to procure evidence of the rag, because we are not allowed phones or electronic devices during the rag.

Ragging the  dreadful menace  of university sub-culture
	
?
Every parent dreams of his or her child qualifying for university education. People work hard sometimes through back breaking physical labour undergoing hardships and agonies to support children?s education, as university education is perceived as the pinnacle of academic achievement in youth and gateway to prosperity. People undergo difficulties however and consider their sacrifices worthwhile when children succeed in entering universities. ?
Aspiring young ones exuding great zeal and energy fall all over themselves and burn midnight oil to make the university dream come true, in order to accomplish bright futures they envision. What greets these blossoming youth from a diversity of backgrounds and social strata from affluent elites to those who are compelled to shed sweat, blood and tears and break their backs to make ends meet as they step in to the universities is so horrendous and beyond imagination. ??
Freshers to universities are subjected to ragging, a practice that forms part of university sub-culture. It is performed by seniors to bully and ridicule newcomers. In some cases seniors mercilessly inflict severe physical and mental harassment including physical abuse with sadistic sexual connotations. ??
?
?
"People are fast becoming techno savvy. They can easily gain unrestricted access to pornographic material in various websites containing obscene & sexually explicit videos and photographs through laptops and hand held devices"
?
Parents are feeling apprehensive for the safety of their children particularly when they enrol in universities from distant places and stay in hostels, as they could easily become soft targets of marauding gangs of raggers. Techniques and forms of ragging in practice have assumed degrading inhuman cruel and vulgar characteristics over the years which manifest diabolical and despicable conduct on the part of senior students deserving outright condemnation. It underscores persistent moral decadence brought about by the prodigious influence of the neoliberal global capital market socio economic model together with the sweeping changes occasioned by the advanced digital computing and communication technology, which has spread into every segment of the society including the so-called educated. ??
Vast spread of information and communication technology has been growingly attracting youngsters towards social media like Face book and Twitter. People are fast becoming techno savvy. They can easily gain unrestricted access to pornographic material in various websites containing obscene & sexually explicit videos and photographs through laptops and hand held devices. Abundant availability of obscene and lewd materials psychologically influences the conduct of perverted elements in younger generation including educated youth entering universities. They are driven to seek fulfilment of irresistible and far-fetched notions of sexuality without regard for the feelings of others. So ragging perpetrated in concealed chambers of torture could be a means of achieving such sinister ends. Moreover seniors could also be motivated by the desire to inflict pain on newcomers to avenge for the suffering they had undergone through ragging. So it appears that ragging is a nefarious practice handed down to successive batches of students as part of the villainous legacy of university sub-culture. ??
?
?
	?It is a practice that forms part of university sub-culture?
	
	
	Seniors are motivated by the desire to inflict pain on newcomers to avenge suffering they had undergone
	
	
	What happened at the Peradeniya University should at least open the eyes of the highest authority
	
	
	?Mechanisms of enforcing disciplinary control within the university system should be bolstered
	
?
A couple of sensational cases reported in the past demonstrate how menacing and torturous ragging could prove and how its traumatic impact had ruined the lives of helpless innocent and aspiring youth with full hopes of excelling in what they were good at. ??
In 1975, Rupa Rathnaseeli, a female student attached to the facility of Agriculture in the University of Peradeniya jumped from the Second Floor of the Hostel to avoid a candle being inserted in to her vagina. She was paralysed for the rest of her life. She was not punished by a marauding psychopath or a criminal hiding to prey upon in some isolated corner of a remote village. She was tortured by the villains and barbarians in the guise of education produced by the nefarious sub-culture prevalent in universities. She was punished for none other than her own ability to excel in studies and earn a seat in the temple of higher learning. She committed suicide in 2002 having failed to make a living and overcome unbearable burdens. ??
Although details of many heart rending cases of ragging could be produced, it is restricted due to space constraints. How extreme forms of physical abuse, sexual vulgarities and exploitations perpetrated on youth straight from schools could help in their orientation to the university environment is incomprehensible. If defies logic and does not stand to reason. If ragging is a ?getting to know? exercise, there could be better ways of doing it whereby raggers as well as those being ragged could jointly enjoy some pleasant and convivial moments leading to formation of lasting comradeship. For that purpose there is no need for newcomers to be subjected to continued ill-treatment for unduly long periods of time making university life hell for them. ??
?
?
What is reported could only be the tip of the monstrous ragging ice-berg prevailing within the university system and best part of the atrocities committed on freshers could still be remaining concealed. There could be many more chambers of torture operating in and outside universities where seniors are unleashing bestialities on innocent newcomers in the name of ragging to derive gratification of demonic pleasures. ?Some members of the body politic espousing Marxist ideology who relish taking moral high ground and steal limelight on matters of public interest and resort to protests at the drop of a hat nowadays cry foul about SAITM. However, they are conspicuously keeping mum on matters such as crass rip-off of needy, sickly and those who are unable to make their ends meet by elite medical professionals whose education has been funded by tax payers? money. Although there is strong opposition to higher education in private institutions there is hardly any word being said about thriving private medical practices conducted by many professionals produced by the so-called free education who charge exorbitant fees. It is well known that professionals in private sector are given to prescribing a whole gamut of expensive medical tests, procedures and reports primarily for commercial reasons irrespective of whether they are of any benefit to the patients concerned. No union or any political grouping openly speaks about such irregularities and injustices. ??
Similarly, political movements which have got their tentacles extensively spread within the university system to achieve their own agendas are keeping mum about the degrading and inhuman treatment meted out to new comers by the seniors in the name of ragging, despite their solemnly declared claims to stand for students? rights. Those could be the invisible hands that manoeuvre student activities to achieve their political ends. By remaining silent such movements are only exposing hypocrisy and callousness. ??
?
?
"They are driven to seek fulfilment of irresistible and far-fetched notions of sexuality without regard for the feelings of others. So ragging perpetrated in concealed chambers of torture could be a means of achieving such sinister ends"
?
Govt of Yahapalanaya captured reins on the plank of protecting human rights. It is duty bound to protect innocent children who work hard and enter universities to pursue higher education. The Government should leave no stone unturned in ensuring that stringent measures are in place to enforce laws of the land against whoever infringing the human rights of new-comer students. Moreover, the mechanisms of enforcing disciplinary control within the university system should be bolstered with more muscle and teeth to make their tasks effective. What happened in the Agriculture Faculty of the University of Peradeniya should at least open the eyes of the highest of the land and the Government apparatus before it is too late to tell the ruffians and bullies that enough is enough and there should be no more abuse in the name of ragging. ?

SAITM CEO and suspect made several calls: Police
	
A number of telephone conversations had been exchanged between the former SAITM CEO Dr. Sameera Senaratne and a Kotikawatte Mulleriyawa Pradeshiya Sabha member who was the alleged main suspect in the shooting incident in Malabe, police investigations have revealed.
Earlier, the police said Dr. Senaratne allegedly staged the shooting which took place in Malabe to falsely portray that his life was in danger.
They said the Pradeshiya Sabha member and the Dr. Senaratne had close connections and according to investigations they had made a number of telephone conversations prior to the shooting and also after the incident.
Several police teams had been deployed across the country to arrest the Pradeshiya Sabha member and a driver of the Pradeshiya Sabha who are absconding. Police believed the duo had planned and executed the shooting.
Police on Monday arrested a resident of Embilipitiya in connection with the incident recovered a 9mm pistol, a 3.8 revolver and a motorcycle, reportedly used in the shooting incident.
Dr. Senaratne was also questioned at length regarding the incident. The Organised Crime Preventive Division are conducting investigations in this regard. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Sand mining -- Ranjan denies issuing letter to renew permit
	
Social Empowerment and Welfare Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake, who refused to issue a letter requesting the extension of a sand mining permit, said today that his secretary had issued it without his knowledge using the seal which has his signature.
?A secretary in my office has issued that letter using the seal and my letter head when I was not in the office. I have given a seal which carries my signature to my office at Divulapitiya as I often go out of office. The secretary has been interdicted following the incident,? he said.
The deputy minister said he would never issue such letters while fighting to protect the environment from illegal sand miners.
When asked whether he was against sand mining he said it should be done legally and under the supervision of the Geological and Mines Bureau.
?This is a business. It should be done legally. We cannot stop it and import sand and stones. At least 48 people have died because of illegal sand mining in Divulapitiya. The government loses million of rupees because of such activities,? the deputy minister said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

SL Govt. lacks commitment to women?s rights issues: HRW
	
The Sri Lankan government delegation seemed incapable or unwilling to address any issues of substance regarding women?s rights including discriminatory marriage laws, land and livelihood concerns, and strengthening laws that protect women, the Human Rights Watch (HRW) charged today.
Issuing a statement, it said the delegation fell back on platitudinous responses that existing laws were sufficient to meet the government?s obligations and that constitutional amendments now under consideration will address other issues.
?Of particular concern was the delegation?s inability to answer questions related to the role women will play in current efforts to seek truth, justice, and reconciliation for the widespread human rights abuses committed during Sri Lanka?s civil war,? it said.
The HRW said Sri Lankan Ambassador in Geneva Ravinatha Aryasinha responded to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW Committee) when it became clear that the committee wasn?t about to let the delegation off the hook.
?But instead of providing direct answers, he delivered a preview of Sri Lanka?s presentation to the Human Rights Council during its 34th session, which began this Monday,? it said.
It said the government betrays a lack of commitment to women?s rights issues by sending a delegation to the CEDAW Committee unprepared to answer obvious questions,
?Governments and human rights activists watching Sri Lanka over the next few weeks during its review at the Human Rights Council would do well to remember Sri Lanka?s appalling performance before the CEDAW Committee. No one at the council should let Sri Lanka dodge critical questions a second time around,? it said.

South Asian Identity will be formulated by South Asian societies rather than South Asian States - Pr
	
In the coming years, Asia is deemed to play a crucial role in the world order with its fast growing economies. Against this backdrop, The Daily Mirror spoke to Prof. Swaran Singh from Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi to explain some recent trends of the region. Singh is a Professor of International Relations at Jawaharlal Nehru University (New Delhi), a Visiting Professor at the Research Institute of Indian Ocean Economies (Kunming, China) and a Senior Fellow at the Institute of National Security Studies of Sri Lanka. He is also the President of the Association of Asia Scholars and the General Secretary of the Indian Congress for Asian and Pacific Studies. Excerpts from his interview follow.?

?
It has been said that South Asia would define the 21st century and the future of the world. What sets this region apart from any other region? ??
We say that the invention of the steam engine in the 19th century led to naval fleets, making some countries great powers. Then, in the 20th century, we had the nuclear revolution, which created superpowers of two countries. The source of power in the 21st century however, is with the people and 1/4th of the human race is in South Asia. ??
This is going to be a distinct strength of the region, whether the citizens are in South Asia or all over the world. It doesn?t matter where they are, because they are closely linked to South Asia due to its ancient culture and a history going back 5000 years. So even when our nationals travel to other places, they are rooted in the culture and traditions of this region. They continue to be South Asian even if they have lived abroad for three generations. Our population is what will make South Asia an important region in the world and define how we grow as a race. ?
The enormous capability that each person has and how productive they will be to society is enormously different to what it was and the time and space shrink is making us more connected. ?
Starting off with current events. The attack on Mosul has started in an attempt to capture key areas held by ISIS. Asia has felt the presence of this group through its attacks, like with what Pakistan has been experiencing for the past week and through its recruitment. Will the recapture of land from ISIS have any effect in Asia? ?
The capability of Al Qaeda to recruit from anywhere in the world has catapulted when it comes to ISIS. They are able to recruit people from almost 50 countries. The rise of ISIS and the violence in our societies is partly due to restlessness since we are not comfortable in adapting to change. This leads to the overreaction of people and nations and is a result of the technological infusion. It does have a direct impact on South Asia since we are all connected. They can recruit from South Asia and those who are recruited may bring back agitation to the region. ??
Another prevailing issue is maritime piracy. The Malacca Strait overtook Somali waters to become the most dangerous waterway in 2014. Asia itself is unique compared to Africa, since almost every country has access to an ocean. Should the initiative of combatting piracy be spearheaded by one nation or should each nation engage in it on its own? ?
As human activity increasingly expands in enormous volumes, there is only a limited amount of land we have. So human activity, from trade to the exploitation of resources, has shifted from territory to waters. We are also shifting in terms of global activity from the North Atlantic and Europe to Asia, and Asia has far more connections to oceans. Our understanding of life therefore has to shift from territory to oceans. ?
?With this shift I don?t think we have a choice in doing things individually. Nation states were created only 350 years ago. Now with this whole time and space shrink, we are becoming even more connected. So we must all pool our resources to deal with this problem. We are talking about a blue economy to attain the sustainability of the human race via the oceans which are not the ownership of any country. These are shared territories, so we all have to work together. ?
In relation to working together to solve problems, let?s look at SAARC. Many are doubting its effectiveness and relevance in the 21st century. We saw these issues highlighted when the 19th summit had to be postponed due to a border dispute. What is the benefit of regional organisations in South Asia? Will SAARC ever have any benefit in the future in this contentious region? ?
First of all as I said, we would always be connected, so we would have to operate at a regional level. It is not a matter of choice. Secondly, all regions have contentions. Europe had wars. Mexico and USA have conflicts. So we are not unique in having problems. True, the India- Pakistan issue derails some initiatives. ??
On whether SAARC is delivering, I think we are too ambitious at times. The EU which is far more advanced in human development, took 50 years to grow. We are only 27-years-old. If you look at SAARC?s achievements, we have a common understanding in combatting terrorism long before Western countries even became aware of it. Look at the anti-climate change initiatives. I agree that we have been lacking in the implementation of all this but we have taken initiatives, set up secretariats and task forces. We are not as developed as the rest of the world, therefore implementation remains our limitation, but SAARC will deliver. The whole inclusion of observers is a reflection of South Asian confidence in allowing others to come in. ?

	Human activity, from trade to the exploitation of resources, has ?shifted from territory to waters.?
	
	
	As Sri Lanka is a good friend of India, India would perhaps expect to know of it in advance. If we think it is a threat, we know how to respond
	
	
	Hambantota port that is being created with the 99 year lease, turning debt into equity, and the large industrial zones are all part of the assets China is creating, which could impinge on the wider understanding of security
	
	
	A common understanding in combating terrorism long before Western countries became aware of it count among SAARC?s achievements
	
	
	Whenever there is a trust deficit, even the smallest thing can become an overreaction. We have a trust deficit with China. So no matter what happens, we read into it
	
?
The issue with the 19th summit was the Jammu-Kashmir problem. 13 years after the ceasefire between the two States, the agreement is in serious trouble with analysts stating that this is because Pakistan needs to regain the prestige lost after the surgical strike on POK launch pads. Will the situation ever resolve itself? ??
My answer is of a freelancing academic and I don?t speak for any Government. I think we will find a solution because one day we will simply forget it. We have fought each other for 70 years and killed millions but have gained nothing, and increasingly these issues will become less important compared to others, especially with the shift from terraferma to oceans, outer space and virtual space. Old obsessions with territories will gradually go away. We were conscious of territorial sovereignty after colonization. Officially we may not say we are giving territory to each other but one day we may just forget about it. ??
You said that borders would disappear, however Asia can be regarded as the capital of nuclear weapons, with China, North Korea, India and Pakistan increasing their arsenals. Is this a threat to the region and the world? ?
During World War II there was a race as to who would build the bomb first and ensure survival. This initial madness is no longer there. The number of nuclear warheads is rising, yes, but the estimates made then were that there would be 50 countries. That?s not the case with countries now, who are even giving up their weapons. India, Pakistan and China have not entered into a mad race but are instead letting scientists take their own time in development.?
?
?
"Just like borders, nukes too will gradually have less importance. We are now talking of climate change as a bigger threat"
?
We still think there is some excitement in having nuclear power but most other states haven given it up. ??
When I was studying, we used to talk about the end of the human race and there were movies like ?Armageddon?, but ?now we don?t even hear about it. Therefore just like borders, nukes too will gradually have less importance. We are now talking of climate change as a bigger threat. Hopefully, we will learn that nuclear science is destructive and such a focus is being seen in India and China. ??
Nuclear weapons equals North Korea. How do we deal with this nation, especially with South Korea having internal problems themselves with their President being impeached. What should be Asia?s response? ?
From the moment nuclear weapons were discovered, the USA was obsessed with being master of them. When it came to North Korea it outsourced the responsibility to China, who became the Convenor of the Six Party Talks which were supposed to resolve the problem. USA understood that North Korea needed an Asian solution and this meant that China was the most important country, since it has been the strongest ally of North Korea.?
We cannot call North Korea?s bluff. The reason for them having these capabilities however, is internal. For the regime to stay in power, they have to concentrate on nationalism and distract people from real internal issues. So to solve the problem of North Korea, we have to inject some means of development into the country and the country most capable of doing this is China. Other countries can work alongside China, like the Sunshine diplomacy of South Korea, to raise the development levels of North Korea. ??
Speaking of China, it seems to bring about the need of a police force to police the police with her South China Sea expansion policy. This is a country that blatantly disregarded a judgement from a tribunal in the Hague on this matter. Can Asia collectively do anything? ?
There is no doubt that China has achieved unprecedented economic growth in the last three decades. That has given them unusual leverages which multiply with a one party rule. That is the reality. We need to look at what is feasible, not purely what is desirable. The most interesting example is the 12th June judgement coming from the Arbitration Court in the Hague, which was on a case being filed by the Philippines. However, the petitioner, President Duterte himself doesn?t care about the judgement. He made visits to Beijing and has said that they could take the island so long as they provide investment and aid.?
Therefore China has different leverages. ??
We cannot always assume that institutions will deliver. We have to be sensitive to the fact that the Chinese have also had some of these claims for a long time, since the Ming dynasty. It is open to interpretation whether we agree with the claims or not. Other countries like Japan and the Philippines are also building islands. So legalistically, everyone is breaching the norm. Moreover, when China signed UNCLOS, they had already made a reservation to the clause making arbitration obligatory, as did two dozen other countries. ?
Let?s look at a threat where the petitioner does mind. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor which is a 46 billion dollar investment has been called unacceptable by Prime Minister Modi. Is it a threat to India? ??
It is not a threat to India but it is definitely a project impinging on India?s national security interests. This has been an unusual relationship from the beginning, with a completely atheist State engaging a religious republic. President Xi Jinping promises 46 billion dollars of overall investment in Pakistan which has about 250 billion dollars of an economy in total. Therefore, 46 is a lot. ??
In addition, this is the only time in history where a country has wanted a 10,000 strong force to protect its engineers and assets. Why do you need such an investment for an economic project? Who are the enemies there? China is very conscious about internal opposition that may erupt as well as any Indian opposition. Ours is based on a legalistic position where, according to international law, a country cannot be investing in foreign territories which it believes are disputed territory, and China is such a country. ?
Most of the world is condemning President Trump for his proposed border wall with Mexico. However India itself has fences with Pakistan and Bangladesh. What is the need for such a construction? Are they even effective in stopping immigration? ?
A wall or a fence is only a temporary solution which shows that you are unable to manage your relations. I am doubtful whether the wall will become a solution. Despite the fences we have, people are still coming across. Mexico and USA also have a fence but they still have drugs coming to the North and arms going to the South. It is not a one-sided problem. ??
Fences are not 100% effective due to the geography surrounding them. There could also be human errors and flaws that allow people to overcome fences. They are therefore merely crisis management tools and don?t solve problems. This is in light of the shift from territory to other spaces like virtual and outer space. You cannot place borders in those places and stop the flow of people or knowledge. It is better to handle things without a wall since it reflects a failure to manage. ??
Moving on to relations with Sri Lanka. Leaving aside all diplomatic language, in all honesty, how much of a threat is China?s investment in Hambantota especially after the submarine issue? Sri Lanka does act as a road block in the naval exercises of India. ??
If a nation knows and understands a threat to its wider security, it will take action to resolve the issue. So, a problem arises if things occur that India does not understand. For example, we formally hear Sri Lankan statements that they will not allow their space to be used by China for military purposes. But suddenly, a submarine pops out to anchor and is full of political symbolism. This is different from just moving around. Because Sri Lanka is a good friend of India, India would perhaps expect to know of it in advance. If we think it is a threat, we know how to respond. But when a very country close to us suddenly shows such activity, it is a surprise. Even the Hambantota port that is being created with the 99 year lease, turning debt into equity, and the large industrial zones are all part of the assets China is creating, which could impinge on the wider understanding of security. Confidence has to be built. If a country is thinking of changing policy, they can do whatever they want but other countries that assume they are also partners would like to be taken into confidence. ??
Submarines are also fundamentally offensive weapons. When they start showing up in Pakistan and Bangladesh, that makes this one popping up to be perceived by India in a different way. But that?s also okay as long as neighbours keep each other in confidence, because whenever there is a trust deficit, even the smallest thing can become an overreaction. We have a trust deficit with China. So no matter what happens, we read into it. ??
Forty years down the road, what will the South Asian region look like post-Trump and post-Brexit? We already have repercussions with the USA cancelling the TPP, which has heavily affected Japan. ?
Since we are talking long-term, I think some of these near term trajectories will not be relevant. Trump as an individual is not important but the rise of Trump as a trend is. This is visible in France, Germany and the Philippines. Democracies which are the most fashionable forms of government are seeing the masses throwing up new leaders, and even if a leader is from an elite class he has to carry the sentiments of the base. ??
The base is empowered today because of technology, so they determine the politics. That will be the trend of the future. The economic and social models of lifestyle we have created will change. More pressure will be exerted now on ensuring sustainability on environmental issues and going back to national frameworks. These trends may come up and trigger new tensions. When the USA starts withdrawing from the global road, China will fill those shoes. There are discussion whether the TPP should invite China now to fill the vacuum. There will always be other countries willing to fill the vacuum but the fundamental change is that human beings will be far more mobile, travelling and working from around the world. They will also be far more capable. Therefore, the identity of South Asia will be formulated by South Asian societies rather than South Asian States. States will have to re-engage other stakeholders such as the media, NGOs and civil society. South Asia will go back to its societal identity and we may see it becoming far more cohesive.

Tips to save energy at home
	
Energy conservation has stepped in to an entirely new level with the advancement of technology and other factors. All types of energy produced have an impact on the environment and therefore it is quite necessary to save energy as much as possible. Some of the main reasons of conserving energy include the consumption of fossil fuels which are a nonrenewable resource. This means that in time to come the last chunk of coal and the last drop of oil would be dug from the Earth. On the other hand using fossil fuels and some other forms of energy would pollute the environment. These two reasons are absolutely important in today?s context and therefore we have to consider alternative methods of conserving energy.
Here are a few tips which you could follow at home :
??? ?Run your refrigerator efficiently :
Your fridge is always switched on, making it one of your most expensive appliances. Make sure the door seal is tight and free from gaps so cold air can't escape. An ideal fridge temperature is 4 or 5 degrees and an ideal freezer temperature is minus 15 to minus 18 degrees Celsius. If you have a second fridge or freezer, only turn it on when you need it.
?
?Insulate your roof :
An insulated ceiling makes a big difference to your energy bills. If you already have insulation installed, check that it is properly installed and has the right rating (measured in 'R-value').?
?
Stop standby power waste :
Up to 10% of your electricity could be used by gadgets and appliances that are on standby. A standby power controller will automatically reduce standby time and switch appliances off when not in use
?
Save energy in the kitchen :
Thaw frozen food in your fridge to reduce cooking time. When you are cooking, use the microwave when you can ? it uses much less energy than an electric oven. If you use the stove, keep lids on your pots to reduce cooking time.?
?
Use energy-efficient light globes :
Replace old incandescent and halogen light globes with energy-efficient globes. Energy-efficient globes save power and last longer.?
?
Conserve water :
Using less water will lower your water bill. And when you use less hot water, you?ll also see savings in your gas bill or your electric bill if you have an electric water heater.
?
Plant more trees and shrubs :
Planting shady trees around your house would lower your summer energy bill by reducing your home?s exposure to the sun.
?
?
Sri Lanka too has moved towards energy conservation through major government projects such as the ?Battle for Solar Power.? United Tractors is one source where you would have access to a fully integrated approach to electric power in Sri Lanka. Many of the biggest buildings and industrial facilities in the country are powered by Cat generators. The most power dependent institutions such as hospitals and 5 star hotels too rely on Cat power.

Zeid 'positive' but wants hybrid court
	
Govt. has advanced on constitutional reforms, showcased positive developments
	Fulfillment of transitional justice commitments are worryingly slow
	Party politics have contributed to a reluctance to address difficult issues
	Authorities need to issue instructions that torture, sexual violence, human rights violations are prohibited and will be punished
	Public messaging around transitional justice, reconciliation generally confusing and at times contradictory
The UN Human Rights Office today recognized that the government had advanced on constitutional reforms and showcased positive developments on constitutional reforms on the broader human rights agenda but reiterated the need to adopt legislation setting up a hybrid court.
It says, ?The slow pace of transitional justice in Sri Lanka and the lack of a comprehensive strategy to address accountability for past crimes risk derailing the momentum towards lasting peace, reconciliation and stability.
?The Government has advanced on constitutional reforms and showcased some positive developments on the broader human rights agenda. The fulfillment of transitional justice commitments has, however, been worryingly slow, and the structures set up and measures taken during the period under review were inadequate to ensure real progress,? the report says.
It makes a number of concrete recommendations, including calling on the Government to embrace the report of the Consultation Task Force, to formulate a communications campaign to inform the public about details of the reconciliation agenda, to invite the UN Human Rights Office to establish a presence in Sri Lanka, to give the highest priority to the restitution of all private land that has been occupied by the military, and to adopt legislation establishing a hybrid court.
The report also highlights a number of serious human rights violations that are reportedly continuing to occur in Sri Lanka, including the harassment or surveillance of human rights defenders and victims of violations, police abuse and excessive use of force, and the use of torture. The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka has stated that the complaints it receives indicate the ?routine use of torture by the police throughout the country as a means of interrogation and investigation.? The report notes that the ?prevailing culture of impunity for perpetrating torture has undoubtedly contributed to this situation.?
?The authorities at all level, from the head of State to military, police, intelligence and local-level leaders, need to publicly issue unequivocal instructions to all branches of the military, intelligence and police forces that torture, sexual violence and other human rights violations are unequivocally prohibited and will be punished,? Zeid said. ?And such violations need to be promptly investigated without fail. This is essential to regain and retain the trust of all Sri Lankans in the authorities, and to reassure them that the State exists to protect the rights of all its people.?
The report which was mandated by the UNHRC to assess progress, commends the constructive engagement of the Government of Sri Lanka with the UN?s human rights bodies, marking a discernible change in policy.
It also recognizes some advances on issues like land restitution and symbolic gestures towards reconciliation, as well as legal reforms and the design of an Office of Missing Persons.
However, the report by the UN Human Rights Office notes that the structures set up and measures taken until now have been inadequate, lacked coordination and a sense of urgency.
?Party politics, including the balancing of power between the different constituencies of the coalition in the run-up to constitutional reforms, have contributed to a reluctance to address difficult issues regarding accountability or to clearly articulate a unified position by all parts of Government. Unclear and often contradictory messages have been delivered on transitional justice mechanisms. Public messaging around transitional justice and reconciliation has been generally confusing and at times contradictory,? the report states.
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra?ad Al Hussein noted that in many ways, Sri Lanka appears to be turning a corner on the promotion and protection of human rights, but he stressed that hard-won gains could prove illusory if they are not tethered to a comprehensive, robust strategy.
?Seventeen months ago, when we published a detailed report on the grave human rights violations committed during the conflict in Sri Lanka, I urged the Government and all the people of Sri Lanka to ensure that this historic opportunity for truly fundamental change should not be squandered,? High Commissioner Zeid said.
?This critical opportunity in Sri Lankan history cannot be missed. I urge the Government and people of Sri Lanka to prioritize justice alongside reconciliation to ensure that the horrors of the past are firmly dealt with, never to recur.?
