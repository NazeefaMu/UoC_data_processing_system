Voucher programme: Action against principals, teachers who sabotage
	
Education Ministry will consider taking disciplinary action against principals or teachers who refuse to support the cash-voucher-distributing system which has been nationally approved, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said today.
We are glad to say that 95% of the cash-voucher programme has been completed. A majority of principals and teachers have supported the programme, but very few of them who have not realized their responsibility and duty are not supporting the voucher programme. There had been some practical problems in several places too since it was the first phase. However, those who try to sabotage the programme purposely might be having different political agendas, the minister said.
The cash voucher system has been implemented recently after obtaining Cabinet approval.
The minister said the programme is productive and effective and as such there should be no difficulties as claimed by some teachers unions.
"The national programme to distribute cash vouchers to students instead of school uniforms cannot be stopped over allegations by a few and therefore the ministry will take action against any principal or teacher who purposely tries to sabotage the programme," he said.
The uniform material distribution programme launched by the previous government in 2014 is only 35% complete by the time of the school vacation. But, 95% of our voucher programme, has been completed by now. I think I should not talk any further about the difference between the old system and the new one."
However, responding to questions asked by journalists, he said he would definitely pay attention to persistent problems within the voucher system and pledged that the shortcomings which have been already identified will be resolved in the next years voucher programme.
All the principals and teachers in government and semi-government schools were requested by the minister of education to comply with the guidelines given in the ministrys circular on the voucher system and fulfill their responsibilities. (Piyumi Fonseka)

JVP condemns proposal to exempt tax
	
	The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today criticized the budget proposal to exempt taxes on foreigners when purchasing lands in Sri Lanka and asked whether those who voted for the government were foreigners.
	Addressing a news conference held at the party headquarters in Battaramulla, JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the same proposal was implemented by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in 2001 as the then Prime Minister.
	Many properties at the Galle Fort and coastal areas of Beruwala were purchased by foreigners because of this tax exemption in 2001. When I was the land minister, I introduced the 100 per cent tax when foreigners purchased lands in the country. The government is attempting to revoke the tax, which is an absurd move, he said.
	He said there was a vast different between the affordability of Sri Lankans and foreigners and as such it was not acceptable to provide privileges for foreigners to buy lands in Sri Lanka for the same price they were being sold to locals.
	MP Dissanayake said the government had made another budget proposal to remove other obstacles when purchasing lands. Accordingly, the proposal would make provisions to release any land easily for those who wished to buy or sell them and also to increase the threshold of the amount of lands owned by one person.
	This proposal is not beneficial to the common citizen or farmers. This has been brought to allow companies to buy lands in large amounts, he said.
	Meanwhile, he said the budget had completely disregarded farmers. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

CEPA coming as ETCA, says GMOA
	
A group International Trade Ministry officials will leave for India on December 21 to make a final decision on the Economic and Technology Cooperative Agreement (ETCA) with India which was earlier known as Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) revealed on Monday.
The revelation was made by International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama during a meeting held yesterday with GMOA members who continuously opposed the long-pending CEPA/ETCA.
GMOA member Dr. Haritha Aluthge told the Daily Mirror that according to International Trade Minister Samarawickrama, a final decision on the long-pending agreement would be made on December 22.
We pointed out the kind of damage that will be posed to the Sri Lankan trade community. We were informed by the minister that they would finalize the ETCA only after reading the facts in the agreement and studying them, Dr. Aluthge said.
However, during a media briefing held yesterday by the GMOA, its Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said all arrangements have been made to sign the CEPA/ETCA agreement between Sri Lanka and India in January.
Though the name CEPA has been changed to ETCA, we still cannot accept allowing unemployed Indian professionals to enter the Sri Lankan labour market. As we previously said, we extend our fullest support to the Government to improve the quality and skills of Sri Lankan professionals up to international standards. But, instead of uplifting local labourers, the government is going to hire Indians. As the ones who opposed the ETCA, we have had to face defamation from some people. Since we oppose it, the GMOAs and all state professionals reputation is being defamed by some people. The public should be concerned over this due to the impending dangers it would cause, Dr. Herath explained. (Piyumi Fonseka)

GMOA to send letter of demand to Patali
	
	The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today said a letter of demand would be sent to Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka for allegedly making defamatory comments alleging a connection between the island-wide strike launched last week by the GMOA and some other professional groups with the Avant Garde issue.
	During an event held recently, Minister Ranawaka said the government should investigate whether there was a connection between the island-wide strike and the Avant Garde issue.
	He suggested that the government probed whether there was an attempt to embarrass Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne for commenting on the Avant Garde issue.
	GMOA Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said they would send letter of demand to Minister Ranawaka for allegedly making defamatory comments regarding collusion between the GMOA and Avant Garde backers.
	He used to work together with us when he was serving as the Power and Energy Minister during the previous government. We are disappointed regarding the allegations of Minister Ranawaka who is also a professional engineer. We should stress that no one can buy off the GMOA for their political agendas. If we are chasing after money and other benefits, we would not even be in the country by now since we have got many opportunities to go abroad to lead luxurious lives while engaging in our profession there. Nevertheless, we do love our country Sri Lanka and that is why we are trying to work for the country despite this kind of defamation, he said.
	He added that though the government sector professionals had received proposals from various politicians to halt their struggle, they never did so and would not.
	He also alleged that they have been informed by reliable sources about a group of 25 persons who had allegedly been arranged by some opponents of GMOA to create Facebook posts and pages defaming government sector professionals. (Piyumi Fonseka)
