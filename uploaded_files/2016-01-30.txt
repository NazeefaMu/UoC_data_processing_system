Govt. launches Mega City Project
	
One of the main objectives of the Government?s highly ambitious Mega City Project is to minimize the huge gap in income, education, health, living standards and social status of Sri Lankans and to create an opportunity for future generations to live as equal partners of the country?s? multifaceted development, President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday.
Addressing the launching of the Western Region Megapolis Planning Project (WRMPP) he said the best example was the difference of living conditions of those occupying high rise luxury apartments and those living in the vicinity.
?Those lucky enough to have access to all good, beautiful and opulent things in life live a life of affluence with utmost comfort in the luxury apartments and those not so fortunate live in a slum nearby in abject poverty struggling to make ends meet. The government?s intention is to find a sustainable solution to this atrocious disparity through the WRMPP and give each and every Sri Lankan family a decent and dignified living by 2030,? the President said.
?The Mega City Project will not develop only Colombo but all other cities in the country equipped with all modern amenities? like IT, new road networks, green parks for recreation, sports complexes, etc. The newly developed satellite cities will prevent people travelling to Colombo for their health and education needs and in search of employment.
?The government has marked 2016 as the year of the beginning of a new era that will achieve upper income group status for Sri Lanka by 2030 and the Centre of Excellence in Asia. We have the ability and skill to meet this goal through unity, harmony, cooperation and understanding among all Sri Lankans,? the President said.
He said when he and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe were selecting the ministers they mulled on the person to be selected to the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development and the first name that came to mind was that of Minister? Ranawaka. The President said Minister Ranawaka had shown his colours when he was in charge of the Power and Energy Ministry and the Environment Ministry.
?He is a highly qualified professional with a clean sheet and the most qualified and suitable person to undertake this historical and national duty of taking Sri Lanka from an island to a continent,? the President said. ?
Minister Ranawaka and his Deputy Lasantha Alagiyawanna presented the WRMPP plan to the President, the Prime Minister and other dignitaries. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

<U+200B>No allegations of war crimes-President Sirisena
	
In a Talk to Al Jazeera interview, the Sri Lankan president Maithripala Sirisena appears to contradict key findings from a UN investigation into the country's civil war, released in September last year.
The report from the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) investigated atrocities committed by both the Tamil separatists and the Sri Lankan Army during the 26-year-long conflict.
In the final stages of the war, attacks carried out by the Sri Lankan Army were so bloody and aggressive that as many as 40,000 Tamil civilians were killed.
In detailing its principal findings, the OHCHR report stated: "If established before a court of law, many of these allegations would amount, depending on the circumstances, to war crimes and/or crimes against humanity."
The Sri Lankan government forces always acted in adherence to international law and according to the laws of the government of Sri Lanka. While doing so, if a member or officer of the armed forces of the Sri Lankan government has committed offences, these investigations are aimed at finding out such instances. So if offences have been committed by an individual, we will clearly take legal action.
Maithripala Sirisena, President of Sri Lanka
Speaking to Al Jazeera's Hoda Abdel-Hamid, Sirisena, rejected the allegations.
"I must say very clearly there is no allegations regarding 'war crimes', there were war crimes allegations during the early stages. But at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, mainly in the proposals presented in September, there were no 'war crimes' allegations against us.
"They contained allegations of human rights violations only. When you consider the facts surrounding the allegations of human rights violations, we are committed as a member of the United Nations, to implementing the main points and proposals," Sirisena said.
The OHCHR report recommended the creation of a "hybrid special court" comprised of international and domestic judges, persecutors, lawyers and investigators.
"Sri Lanka must now move forward to dismantle the repressive structures and institutional cultures that remain deeply entrenched after decades of erosion of human rights," said Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, UN high commissioner for human rights, when the report was published last year.
At the time, the high commissioner, who is expected to arrive in Sri Lanka on February 5, also warned against a purely domestic court.
"The levels of mistrust in state authorities and institutions by broad segments of Sri Lankan society should not be underestimated," he said, adding it is for this reason that the establishment of a hybrid special court is so essential.?
"A purely domestic court procedure will have no chance of overcoming widespread and justifiable suspicions fueled by decades of violations, malpractice and broken promises."
When Sirisena defeated Mahinda Rajapaksa in elections a little over a year ago, the possibility of a new beginning seemed to be at hand.
Sirisena had run on promises to bring those responsible for crimes to justice, to end government corruption and nepotism, and open up the economy in ways that would finally benefit the common man and woman.
But how far has he come to realising these promises?
He says he has already instituted reforms that limit presidential powers, and will soon start reworking the constitution.
In conversations with the people of Sri Lanka, there is a sense of continued goodwill towards their leader, but also, impatience.
Just over a year after he came to power, in his first in-depth international television interview, Sirisena discusses the UN investigation, fighting corruption, and national reconciliation.
He tells Abdel-Hamid that he is committed to bringing war time perpetrators to trial, but that he is opposed to foreign involvement.
"Within that commitment, we will always act in accordance with the sovereignty of our country and in accordance with our constitution. For this work, we can obtain foreign technology in certain areas. In terms of people we definitely do not need outsiders."
Sirisena denies providing conflicting messages or backtracking on ensuring justice is served, saying: "There is no way of doing this in an express or super fast manner. So what we are hoping to do through this is to free the country from the allegations that have been made against it. To free the country, we must clearly face the truth, and similarly we must take decisive actions towards accountability."
He also discusses fighting corruption in Sri Lanka. "We must not be worried or in a hurry. 2016 is the year of showing results," he said.
"We have restored the independence of the judiciary, made the investigating institutions independent; their officers are allowed to function freely. They will show their results of their efforts in the future."

While cross examining the crown witness in the non-summary inquiry into the killing of former TNA Jaffna District MP Nadaraja Raviraj, Defense Counsel who appeared for the second suspect, alleged that the crown witness, Sampath Prithiviraj, and his accomplices from Karuna?s party had been involved in the alleged killing and later appeared as a crown witness to protect himself from facing charges.

Water levels dropping in upcountry
	
The water levels in rivers, canals, tanks and reservoirs in the upcountry are fast declining because of the prevailing dry weather. The main waterfalls including St.Claires, Kadiyanlena, and Lovers Leap are also running dry.
However, the environmentalists said haphazard deforestation, setting fire to forests and the unauthorised construction in catchment areas were also some of the reasons for the drop in water levels and water falls running dry. They said the prevailing dry weather could also affect hydropower generation.
Meanwhile, the villagers in several areas who depended on streams and water ways said that they were also facing a shortage of drinking water.?(Shantha Chandrasiri and Shelton Hettiarachchi)
