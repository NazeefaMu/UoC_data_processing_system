Aloysius spoke to COPE MPs during sittings
	
Evidence at the Bond Commission today revealed that PTL Owner Arjun Aloysius spoke to several members of the Parliamentary watchdog Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) during COPE hearings.
Aloysius had spoken a total of 227 times to Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe, 18 times with Dayasiri Jayasekara, 176 times with Harshana Rajakaruna and 73 time of Hector Appuhamy during periods commencing January 2015.
Cabinet Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara had also been in communication with Arjun Aloysius with 18 calls going to and from him with Aloysius in total, with two calls during the period of the COPE hearings. The communications with Jayasekara had commenced on July 10, 2015.
The second Committee of Public Enterprise (COPE) was established on May 6, 2016 to investigate the controversial Bond Issuance.
The evidence presented by the Attorney General revealed that Arjun Aloyisus had also been in constant contact with MPs Hector Appuhamy, and Harshana Rajakaruna, whilst they were sitting in the COPE committee investigating the Bond Issuance.
The other MP names were highlighted in a forensic report presented by the Criminal Investigations Department during yesterdays hearing of the Bond Commission.
The other MP Ajith P. Perera who had only two calls (one incoming and one outgoing), between him and Aloysius.
Senasinghe was appointed midway during the proceedings, after the resignation of UNP MP M. Welakumar on July 8, 2017.
The total number of Telephone calls to and from Senasinghe to Aloysius between the period July 4, 2015 to March 3, 2017 was 227.

The evidence was through sub- inspector Yasanka Jayasinghe of the Criminal Investigations Department who had forensically examined all the relevant data.
Counsel for Former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran vehemently objected to the admitting of the evidence initially. The objections were overruled with the Commissioner ordering written submissions to be tendered within seven days to the Commission.
ASG Yasantha Kodagoda was to later remark following the revelations that "It is exactly knowing all of this that they objected to it".
Jayasinghes evidence was the only evidence led throughout the day, which highlighted many calls to and from between Aloysius, Mahendran and other directly connected parties to the issuance of Bonds.
The evidence was led out following the tabling of a 127 page forensic report in which Jayasinghe explained the method of extracting data. All telecom service providers had complied with the orders of the Commission and provided data during the time period commencing January 1, 2017.
Jayasinghe said that Dialog Axiata had not given the full report due to technical difficulties, Jayasinghe said, but had complied and provided all data that was within their reach. Jayasinghe said that the Telecom giant had requested a further 120 days to provide all the relevant data pertaining to the mobile phones Aloysius and Mahendran.
During evidenced led yesterday the phone details of Arjun Aloysius, Arjun Mahendran, Indika Saman Kumara, Naveen Anuradha, Kasun Palisena, S. Pathumanapan were laid out.

American Heart Association president suffers heart attack
	

DAILY MAIL, 15th NOVEMBER, 2017
The 52-year-old president of the American Heart Association suffered a heart attack during the organizations annual conference.
John Warner, CEO of UT Southwestern University Hospitals in Dallas and a practicing cardiologist, suffered a minor episode on Monday morning in Anaheim, California.
It came hours after he delivered his keynote speech on Sunday afternoon about preventing heart attacks in older people, sharing that all the men suffered heart conditions in their 60s.
Warner was taken to a local hospital near the conference, where doctors inserted a stent to open a clogged artery - a common move that Warner performs often himself, but one that was brought into question by a recent study which found the operation carries more risks than benefits.
He was met at the hospital by his wife, daughter and son who all had come to watch his speech at the conference.

British MP says SL war casualty figure 7,000, not 40,000
	
Lord Naseby of UK Parliament recently revealed how he accessed confidential reports compiled by the Londons Defence Attache in Sri Lanka during the war and gathered that the number of people who were killed during the last phase of war was 7,000.
Lord Naseby has told WIONs Mandy Clark how he went about the onerous task of accessing confidential reports compiled by none other than Londons own Defence Attache in Sri Lanka during the last phase of war in 2009 and came up with startling discoveries.
Ive tracked the war carefully because I just couldnt believe these official figures - they didnt stack up to the information I was getting. So I then invoked our freedom of information inquiry. I asked for the dispatches sent by our Defence Attache to our foreign office during the last days of the war. The application was refused twice by our foreign office. I then applied directly to the information commissioner - which is my right  and got 26 pages of redacted dispatches. Missing were the last six weeks of them. So I appealed again. And lo and behold, another 12 arrived. I went through them very carefully, he said.
He said there was more than enough evidence to say that no one in the Sri Lankan government had said anything about killing any civilians at all.
That was not the objective of the exercise. And from our Defence attaches dispatches, I thus gleaned that about 7,000 were probably killed. And even (the Attache) says that about a quarter of those killed were possibly Tamil Tigers (LTTE) because theyd thrown away their uniforms, he said.
Without being limited to classified documents, Lord Naseby had asked university experts who are "traditionally left-wing" about the casualties.
They also said that 7,000 casualties was their estimate. There was other evidence too, like what US ambassador to Sri Lanka, Robert Blake, had named a tentative casualty figure: about 5000, a few days before the end of the war, he said.
He had appealed to the UK government to amend the casualty count from 40,000 to 7,000.
Lord Naseby says that he keeps telling the Metropolitan Police of London that it is wrong to allow LTTE demonstrations as the organisation had been proscribed by most countries including the UK.
The police had claimed that the demonstrators cleverly change tiny details on the flag each year in order to escape the ban on the original design.
He says he is all for an investigation into some controversial deaths during the last phase of war, such as the killing of three top Tigers despite their attempt to surrender carrying a white flag.
Of course, those really guilty of war crimes must be investigated. But to decry the entire leadership of Sri Lanka as war criminals - its not done, Lord Naseby told WION.

Increasing incidents of sword attacks in Jaffna
	
I will bring to the attention of the Inspector General of Police the escalating sword attacks taking place in Jaffna, NPC Governor Reginald Cooray said.
He made the above comments at the media conference held at the NPC Governors Office yesterday.
The NPC Governor said that the sword attacks in Jaffna had increased and hence the issue will be brought to the attention of the IGP.
"I have also sent a letter to the President to relocate the security forces occupying the private lands to the Jaffna Fort," the NPC Governor said.
Meanwhile, the journalists posed a question to the Governor that the Jaffna Fort belonged to the Department of Archaeology and called for his comments. Responding to it he said that the Dutch, Portuguese, British, Sri Lanka Army and thereafter the LTTE had occupied the Fort and hence the question was irrelevant.
NPC Governor said that social activists will be awarded the Governors Award in the coming years. Awards were given by the Departments of Education and Sports Activities including the Chief Ministers award in the past.
"Steps will be taken to give away awards to social activists, farmers, efficient government officials and employees in the coming years who had been deprived of such awards in the past. Certain members have donated their lands for public use towards the social progress. When we felicitate and honour them, many others too will come forward to make donations. The applications for the Governors Award could be obtained from the District Secretariat and return them duly filled," Governor Reginald Cooray said. (M. Roshanth)

LCs opened prior to Budget: Vehicles can be cleared under previous duty rates
	
Those who have already opened Letters of Credit (LC) in their names to import vehicles prior to the Budget proposals announced on November 9 will be allowed to clear those vehicles at the duty rates that prevailed before the Budget, the Finance Ministry said today.
The ministry said however, these vehicles should be cleared before April 30, 2018.
It said in a statement that the tax concession announced in the budget-2018 for imported brand new electric car will be extended to cover used electric cars as well, which are not more than one year old.
According to a Gazette notification issued by Minister of Finance and Mass Media Mangala Samaraweera, the duty on used electric cars that are not more than one year old will be reduced by around Rs one million.
Consequently, the duty rate applicable to electric vehicles (Less than one year old ) will be Rs 12,500 per KW power of the motor of the electric car which is less than 100 KW power.
The Ministry said in the budget-2018, the finance minister introduced an appropriate incentive structure to promote the importation of vehicles powered by non-fossil fuel.
It said the Minister had introduced a new formula for import taxes on vehicles to be levied based on the engine capacity instead of the ad-valorem rate (CIF Value of the vehicle) rationalizing the tax base on vehicle.
In addition, the Loan to Value (LTV) ratio for motor cars which is 50:50 at present will be further relaxed for Hybrid vehicles.
The Loan to Value Ratio will be revised and the Finance facilities could be provided by banks up to 50 percent of the value for petrol and diesel motor cars, 70 percent of the value for Hybrid cars and 90 percent of the value for electric cars.
Duty on locally assembled vehicle will remain as 30% and not 40 percent as announced in the budget , the ministry said.
Meanwhile, the ministry said the sale of Condominium housing unit will be liable for VAT from April 1,2018. However, sale under a sales agreement entered in to, before April 1, 2018 will not be liable for VAT.

MS wants to patch up with JO: Isura
	
President Maithripala Sirisena wants to go forward as a party with the joint opposition, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said yesterday.
Addressing a news briefing, the Chief Minister said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and senior members of the joint opposition still wanted to be a part of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) although several new party members were opposed to it.
Several senior members of the JO including Mahinda Rajapaksa do not want to split the party. However, there are several people against this. The SLFP and JO are still at the discussion level to finalise whether they should contest together, he said.
Chief Minister Devapriya said party supporters were disappointed with the joint opposition because of their speeches at recent political fora. He said the people had already decided which party they would choose in the event of a split.
It is up to Mahinda Rajapaksa to decide. However, the president do not want to split the party. That is why he has given approval for chief ministers to meet and discuss the matter with former President Rajapaksa. The discussions were however unsuccessful due to the attitude of several JO members who are close to former President Rajapaksa, he said.
Commenting on the upcoming local government polls, he said the Elections Commissioner had given all facilitates to hold the election.
The election can be a better chance to prove the power of the SLFP. The alliances are still with the SLFP and are yet to decide under which symbol they are going to contest at the election, he said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

No proposals to overcome country's economic crisis: MR
	
While claiming that fraud and corruption of the government had put the country into an economic crisis, former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa said today no plan had been proposed in the budget or future development programmes by the President and the Prime Minister to come out of it.
Speaking during the budget debate, he said the debt obtained by the government during the last three years had increased by Rs. 2,773 billion from Rs. 7,391 in 2014 to Rs. 10,164 billion.
He said it was the Sirisena and Wickremesinghe government that had put the country into a debt trap even though they accused his government of doing so.
"We had reduced debt burden to the debt to GDP ratio by 71 per cent when we handed over the government. But now it had increased to 85 per cent. We managed debt servicing effectively by reducing the interest rate. But today the government had increased government expenses on its own and faced an economic crisis," he said.
He said his government had spent the loans on ending the war, reconciliation process and development programmes in the North and in the other parts of the country.
"We constructed ports, airports, state buildings and developed road network in the country. But the present government has not done any development programme or developed infrastructure," he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa said the government's fraud and corruption had gone up where they had to pay Rs. 145 billion as interest due to the bond scam, Rs. 15 billion as compensation due to cancellation of the Srilankan airlines order to purchase airbuses and Rs. 21 billion due to the cancellation of the port city project," he said.
He said people and businessmen had to pay twofold of the tax they paid in 2014 and added that the government was boasting about increasing tax revenue.
Mr. Rajapaksa also said that the budget had proposed to sell state resources to foreigners by liberalising laws to enable foreigners to buy lands without any obstacle.
He said the government had no power to sell or lease out state resources without peoples' approval and added that steps would be taken to nationalise state resources sold or lease out without peoples' approval. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

On the trail of Colombos Dug up Roads
	
Road conditions in many areas ofSri Lanka are nothing to brag about, screaming for much improvement. Being Sri Lankans, weve all experienced the bumpy rides where vehicles drive over the potholes during which the person in the non-driving seat inconveniently hugs the dashboard. But, todays focus isnt on the natural wear and tear of roads, but on man made damageto roads. 
Over the past few months, there were numerous complaints regarding the recurrence of excavations where roads have been damaged as a result. These damages to the roads made the do a tour around and about the Colombo areas. Judging by the nature of the reconstruction of roads, it was clear that there was a lack of co-ordination between the state institutions that conduct road excavations. The public seem to be inconvenienced by the recurring road constructions. Some hinted at the presence of the possibility of a road mafia. Could the lack of co-ordination between these institutions be intentional or boil down to negligence 
Not only did the condition of these roads affect the morning and evening traffic, which was already frustrating, there were consequences too. The reconstructed roads were uneven and of a lower quality compared to roads in other areas. In addition to these woes, there have been instances where the excavation process has damaged nearby property. Therefore, the decided to dig up more information about these man-made pits. 
The reconstructed roads were uneven and of a lower quality compared to roads in other areas. In addition to these woes, there have been instances where the excavation process has damaged nearby property
How do these pits affect you 
A countrys road system is a crucial aspect of its development process. A road is essential to travel on, but the more time a citizen spends on the road, the less productive the country becomes. The Oxford Dictionary defines man-hour as An hour regarded in terms of the amount of work that can be done by one person within this period. Millions of these man hours are lost to the country in term of workforce per year due to the time spent on the roads unnecessarily. In order to spend less time on the road, as well as to prevent many avoidable accidents, due to less than ideal road conditions, its essential that the roads in the country are maintained in pristine condition.  
Road construction work also poses fatal threats which lead to road accidents. One such example is the incident that occurred a few months ago in Nugegoda, where a partially closed road resulted in a collision of vehicles. Stanley Thilakaratna Mawatha was the location of an accident where two motorcycles collided. Part of the road had been excavated to mend a leaking pipe.
However, because the excavated part of the road wasnt repaired perfectly it paved the way for the accident, involving the motorcyclists. Businessmen in the vicinity voiced their protests that even previously too such accidents had occurred at the same place. The said that these accidents had happened due to the improper and incomplete construction of the road. Even when requests were made from relevant officials for the completion of the road constructions there was no response. 
Road construction is a costly procedure carried out using public money. Each time a road is broken and reconstructed, a large sum of money is spent. Is this always done out of necessity Residents complained that a particular place on the road leading to Braybrooke Place was dug up thrice during the past three months. Isnt there a procedure that makes the institutions managing water, electricity and telecommunications to carry out their construction work before a road is newly carpeted 
Weve received complaints of damage to private property as a result of roads being dug up. Vipulasena Mawatha residents had to wait one year before receiving compensation for the damage done to their properties due to the laying out of a drainage system. 
Whats the correct procedure
Jayantha Guruge Former CMC Advertorial Committee Chairman when contacted said that digging up of a road might happen either due to the need of an individual, as in the case of installing a line for water supply to a house, or organization. Guruge said that excavation on a road can be done to install or repair lines that supply water or electricity, such lines often being placed beneath the middle of the road. In either instance, depending on whether the roads concerned belong to the Colombo Municiple Council (CMC) or the Road Development Authority (RDA), one has to obtain permission from the respective authorities.
After an application is submitted, the area is inspected by a CMC officer who then provides an estimate. This estimate provides details of the cost of the total operation, including re-tarring or carpeting. After the road is dug up and construction concludes the contractors from the organization backfill the hole with CMC approved material. Following backfill, the CMC reconstructs the road. If the backfill doesnt meet the standard, the contractors are forced to relay the road.  These initial measures dont guarantee 100% quality as before. After about 3 months the road is scraped using a mining machine and then re-carpeted using a paver, he explained.
Road construction is a costly procedure carried out using public money. Each time a road is broken and reconstructed, a large sum of money is spent. Is this always done out of necessity
A panorama of perspectives
When inquired about the delay in repairing damages to roads by organizations like The Water Board and Electricity Board, RDA Chairman Nihal Ranjith Sooriyaarachchi stated that these organizations are supposed to repair the roads under the supervision of the RDA. But sometimes, as with The Water Board, they cant identify the leak immediately because the pipelines are situated underground. Therefore they leave the site without repairing. When there is lack of staff and when a bigger project is undertaken, they leave the site in the present condition. This is the development that led to the incident at Staney Thilakaratne Mawatha,he added. 
They have to operate on a trial and error basis when dealing with old pipelines. We understand that the damage done to multiple sites and the lack of staff are inevitable. Even though we have heavily cautioned workers to take safety measures, such putting up barriers or installing lights, these instructions arent always followed by these organizations, he further stated.
Minimising inconvenience
When inquired about the slow progress at the sites dug up by The Water Board, the spokesperson explained that the construction is usually done during the night. He said that this time is used to minimise the inconvenience caused to the public. However, he said that the times might change if the project is huge. But in the instance when the electricity or telecommunication lines are harmed, while digging up the roads, the respective institution is informed and the pit is left for them to work on. During such instances there might be a delay which in turn inconveniences the public, the spokesperson said. 
When inquired about complaints regarding the repeated opening up of roads at the same place, following reconstruction, he responded by saying that following repairs the roads are closed to check the pressure in the water pipes. If something goes wrong then these sites have to be opened up again and again due to the out dated technology thats being used. But a project is being carried out these days to replace the pipes using a new technology, he said. 
No delays
The Water Board alleged that while it is engaged in the process of fixing pipelines after roads are dug up, electricity lines sometimes get damaged. A spokesperson from The Water Board said that workmen from his institution remain until representatives of the Electricity Board arrive to fix the damaged lines, so that they can finish their work. When inquiries were made from the Electricity Board, regarding this issue, it responded by stating that the damage to electricity lines are generally reported and that they set out to fix the lines right away without delaying.
When inquired whether the Electricity Board initiates road excavations to fix or extend electricity lines and whether it supervises the reconstruction work of roads fixed, a CEB engineer said, If we want to dig up the roads, we obtain permission from the CMC. We make a payment and obtain a permit. But once the lines are subject to alterations, the CMC is informed and thereafter the tarring and carpeting of the roads are done by the CMC. 
Sudden increase of construction sites
During the Daily Mirror investigations it was unearthed that the ongoing Colombo Water Supply Service Improvement Project, aimed at replacing the underground water pipes (most which are over a century old) supplying the Colombo city, is linked with much of the construction sites on the roads. This project aims at minimizing water loss, which is currently close to 33% of the total water supply. The authorities also plan to use the project to replace 60% of the pipelines with computerized pipelines. The Daily Mirror spoke to the Project Director, about the inconvenience caused to the public as a result of the project.
He revealed that reconstruction of these roads is done by the contractors of the Water Board, with the conference of the CMC and the Traffic Police. He further stated that the project is expected to continue until 2021 due to certain difficulties present in carrying out the repairs. Our task has been made more difficult because much of the water system is located underground and isnt properly mapped, with the electricity and telecommunication services overlapping at times. In order to minimize the disturbances to the public much of the construction is carried out at night, he further stated. With the new digital water system, which uses high quality pipes, we can expect an improved water supply along with minimal damage to roads, he concluded. 
Root of the problem
According to Member of Parliament, Colombo Municipal Councillor and JVP member Hemantha Weerakoon, even when a person requests for a new water supply, this individual has to pay the Water Board and the CMC for the damages done to the road. However, most of the time the reconstruction work isnt done on time. Even when reconstruction is done on time there is a drop in quality. One week after the reconstruction, there are giant ditches in the place that the repair was done, he said. 
When inquired about the reasons for these loopholes in the system, he said that it was due to the lack of a long term vision. He pointed out that the absence of coordination contributed hugely to this issue. As a politician, I see that absence of a plan. Personally nor institutionally no one is willing to take responsibility regarding these issues. Nobody takes measures to resolve them either. People are concerned about themselves and the ultimate result is the waste of public money. There should be a long term vision and a plan of action and coordination between the Central Government and the Provincial Council, he concluded 
End of the road
Digging up roads to repair and expand the services running underground is a necessary and inevitable evil. But, it was evident from our inquiries that these projects arent carried out optimally, resulting in a considerable loss of public money and inconveniencing citizens. Lack of coordination between the respective institutions, being short of labour and the lack of a follow up procedure were some of the problems that the Daily Mirror identified with regards to the overall issue of road damage. 
There are roads that need much improvement in the Colombo District. By using a sustainable long-term system and including all the organizations involved, the public money thats wasted on digging up roads and refilling them could be used more productively, on the roads that actually need improvement. 
The road construction conundrum in the country has created an eroteme with no proper answer to mark a full stop to the ongoing doubts that arise naturally. So taking the much talked about topic of the road situation on to the roads the obtained the views of the people.
The road named Vipulasena Mawatha, where Asoka College is located, also harboured a rocky stretch. Renovation work is visible only on one part of the avenue. In the middle of the construction chaos, we spoke to a few of the local residents. 
We are greatly inconvenienced
Henry Joseph (53) a local resident of Vipulasena Mawatha 
Since last August they have been engaged in construction of this road, but still theres no progress. Road construction was initiated by the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) and work on the road took place according to the terms of a contract. At the time of the construction the walls of some houses in the neighbourhood cracked and collapsed. Since then the construction of the road was aborted. Now they have just begun fixing the damage.
This damage was done right in front of a school, so it isnt good for the neighbourhood and the school. Initially the construction on the road was commenced with the aim of draining out rain water that collects. They dug 10 feet underground to build a drainage system to avoid rain water from collecting. The CMC is halfway through the initiative and the roads are broken. They just start work and stop abruptly. They have now started fixing the damage. Must see what happens. But we have faced some losses, said Joseph.
Another local resident of Vipulasena Mawatha, who spoke on terms of anonymity, expressing his views on the issue said, For a period of one and a half years they have been fixing this road.
Walls of neighbouring houses collapsed
S.P.C. Kumarasinghe
The CMC is responsible for the road construction in the area, but at the time of excavating, the walls of the neighbouring houses collapsed. So construction has been put on hold until the damage is fixed,said Kumarasinghe.
Investigating more roads in the Colombo area, the Daily Mirror observed that Braybrooke Road and some roads in the vicinity had uneven tarring. This condition was visible for miles which led us to believe that these roads had undergone some excavation as well.
Following are quotes from folks who frequent these roads.
Roads are in bad condition
Wales Kumar (32)
The conditions created by initiating road constructions cause damages to vehicle parts. I come from Wattala to Colombo and the roads are in bad condition. Its hard on the vehicles when we drive on these roads. 



Work is incomplete
Sarath Gunasinghe (50)
We cant drive on these roads. The roads are broken and unevenly tarred. Roads dug across to make drains and work is incomplete. At one time they carpeted the roads, but the next they break the roads again. From the time I can remember this has been going on for a while. This road was very recently broken again. 

Roads are dug up often
W.K.R. Galappatti (47)
Drains are situated at uneven levels throughout the road. They are dangerous. Drains should be constructed at the same level. About two weeks ago, the road was dug up and workmen reasoned that it was to place some telephone lines.
Roads are dug up often after tarring and carpeting. They arent even fully completed before they return and break down the roads again. 
 We dont benefit from anyof this
Prabath Weerasinghe (41)
The RDA comes and constructs the roads. First of all what I can say is that they dont have a strategic plan. There is no collaboration between the many sectors that are responsible for road construction. If they collaborated, the roads wouldnt have had to be dug so often. First of all, a long-term strategic plan has to be made. But in reality they only plan for a few months and construct roads. Later they commence construction to widen the roads, so that two vehicles can pass each other.
They could have planned this before the initial construction of the road. Why are they doing this Is it for commissions But we dont benefit by any of this. Three months ago they broke this road thrice. There was a time where they were excavating at the same spot for a week. They break the roads when they dig. After tarring and carpeting the roads, they break the roads again. 
They construct halfway
Lalith Kumara (46)

They construct halfway. Water also fills. It is hard to travel on the roads.

Promoting HR cannot be done overnight: SL
	
Promoting and protecting human rights is a work in progress and it is not something that can be done overnight despite the most sincere of commitments, Sri Lanka told the third cycle of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) session of the country in Geneva yesterday.
In the opening statement, the Head of the Sri Lankan Delegation, National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said the UPR, to us, is a process that recognizes this fact.
The UPR is a process that is aimed at helping each other self-assess, share best practice, and support one another to take steps to more effectively address the concerns of individuals in our respective countries. There are many, both in Sri Lanka and overseas, who question the commitment of the National Unity Government to addressing concerns of human rights. Of course it is natural to be impatient; it is natural to question; and it is natural to feel a sense of frustration. We all know very well that some who criticize do so with the best intentions as they want Sri Lanka to do well, he said.
He said there is no nation that does not have challenges, and no nation is perfect.
In a democracy, however, he said, it was not easy to always make changes at great speed, or navigate change in a rapid manner, or along a straight and preconceived path.
Dr. De Silva said significant progress has been made in Sri Lanka since the last UPR in 2012 and the National Unity Government has facilitated policy coherence and stability that enabled decision-making required to make the Governments pledge to its people a reality.
He said the Government is committed to a process of truth-seeking, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence and that the reconciliation mechanisms that are being set up are for the entire people of Sri Lanka.
Investigations into allegations pertaining to human rights and humanitarian law violations during the conflict are unfortunately misperceived by some in my country, as specifically targeting the security forces, which is completely erroneous. As the President recently stressed, security forces will not be unfairly targeted or punished. But, we are committed to investigations being carried out in respect of violations of the law, through judicial processes, respecting due process, he said.
Meanwhile, he said the Constitution Reform process is prioritised as a measure for guaranteeing non-recurrence of conflict.
In response to the several advance questions that have been submitted in relation to implementation of the commitments in the UN Resolutions in Sri Lanka, the Deputy Minister reaffirmed the governments firm commitment to ensuring their implementation.
He said Sri Lanka has accomplished much but the government does not consider it a reason to be complacent.
We remain acutely aware and conscious that there is much more to be done, to ensure that all our citizens enjoy the rights due to them to their full extent. Our efforts to ensure harmonious relations between the different ethno-religious communities, and our commitment to constitutional reform, are often attacked by opponents as attempts to create divisions. Yet, we persevere with strong determination, he said.
As a democratic country, he said Sri Lanka welcomed robust criticism and debate about its journey towards the full enjoyment of human rights, and sustainable peace and reconciliation.
Later yesterday, in a facebook post, the Deputy Minister said global response to Sri Lankas progress in human rights achievements was extremely positive and constructive.
It was a great pleasure for our delegation to hear State after State commend the progress made by our National Unity Government after I made my opening remarks. Ninety countries made short interventions. They appreciated our commitment and understood the difficulties in implementing our commitments; and encouraged us to do more particularly on reconciliation and accountability, he said.

Malaysian security and enforcement personnel will undergo sea combat training in Sri Lanka to strengthen and upgrade their skills in maritime security control, the New Straits Times reported.
Eastern Sabah Security Command (Esscom) commander Datuk Hazani Ghazali said the training would be conducted next year with Sri Lankas security forces.
Dubbed Sea Combat Course, the training is aimed at equipping the Esscom team with added skills.
The expertises of the Sri Lankans in safeguarding their waters are recognised worldwide, he told reporters at the Esscom monthly gathering @ the police marine base here, today.
Hazani said about 20 personnel from three agencies  police, armed forces, and the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency - would participate in the intensive training.
On another development, he said Esscom would establish a control post on Pulau Ligitan off Tawau in an effort to intensify security in the area, adding that the post would be managed by three security agencies.
The island is located at the border of Malaysian waters hence it is exposed to neighbouring Indonesia and the Philippines. The waters are usually used as a route by immigrants to enter the state.
The post will also be able to prevent elements that can jeopardise the security of the Eastern Sabah Safety Zone from slipping into the country, he stressed.
During the monthly gathering, 140 security personnel led by Hazani took the corruption-free pledge while witnessed by Lahad Datu Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission chief Wan Kamal Noor Izwan Wan Kamaruddin.

SL should adopt timeline for action: HRW
	
Countries at the UN Human Rights Council should press Sri Lanka for a time-bound action plan on reforms during its third Universal Periodic Review, which began yesterday, the Human Rights Watch (HRW) said.
In a statement, it said successive Sri Lankan governments, including under President Maithripala Sirisena, have failed to ensure accountability for serious rights violations and other important commitments.
The Sirisena government made key pledges at the Human Rights Council in October 2015 to ensure justice, accountability, and security sector reform. The failure of the government to fulfill most of these promises has brought its commitment to reform into question and dashed hopes of victims and affected communities, HRW Geneva director John Fisher said.
The statement said the Sri Lankan government has taken several positive steps since the last review in 2012.
Human rights activists and journalists do not fear arrest for expressing their views and criticism. Allegations of arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances against the Tamil minority have dropped considerably. In May 2016, the government ratified the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Since 2015, Sri Lanka has invited several UN and other international experts to provide recommendations.
However, a number of urgent human rights issues are pending, many arising from the 2015 council resolution that promised to create four transitional justice mechanisms to address abuses linked to the three-decade conflict that ended in 2009. Thus far, the government has only established the Office of Missing Persons, but even there has procrastinated.
The governments budget outline for fiscal year 2018 contains no reference or allocation for the remaining three mechanisms. Other resolution undertakings, such as security sector reform and land reform, remain largely unfulfilled. In particular, the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) has not yet been repealed; although the government claims it has not enforced the act for the last six months, many PTA suspects remain in prison and those finally released after years of detention without charge have not received redress. Protests across the country in recent months have demanded reform and justice including for PTA detainees.
During the review, governments should also raise concerns about womens rights and protections around sexual orientation and gender identity. Sri Lanka has discriminatory marriage and divorce laws that unfairly impact women from minority backgrounds. Laws that criminalize homosexual conduct remain in effect and are regularly used by the authorities to jail, bribe, and abuse men and women, it said.
Sri Lanka is in danger of not just standing still on rights, but backtracking on essential reforms. UN members need to look beyond the increasingly hollow promises of reform, and insist that the government present an action plan and timeline for honoring its commitments, Fisher said.

Southland MP urges NZ govt. not to deport SL family
	
A New Zealand Parliamentarian has written to the countrys Immigration Minister urging him to allow a Sri Lankan family whose visa has not been renewed to stay in the country, the Newstalk ZB today reported.
The Wijerathne family, three boys and mum Dinesha and dad Sam, have lived here for nearly eight years.
Dinesha held an essential work visa to work as a chef in Queenstown, but it was not renewed because she developed Multiple Sclerosis - and cannot work full time. They are now facing a deportation date of November 21.
Clutha Southland MP Hamish Walker has appealed to the Immigration Minister on the family's behalf.
He asked in the letter to the Minister that any matters around deportation are put on hold and a temporary work visa be issued to Sam so he can financially support the family while they are here.
"I want this family to be able to stay in NZ. They have contributed a huge amount over the last eight years, so I want to do everything I can to fight for this family, it is why I have written to the Minister of Immigration."
Baskets of Blessing director Tam Schurmann set up a Givealittle page for the family, which has raised more than $14,000 dollars.
She is calling for compassion from the Immigration Department.
"This is not a family who came to New Zealand and is taking advantage. This is not a family who has asked for handouts. It is a situation that could happen to anybody."

Trump tells a tale about Air Force One
	

DAILY MAIL, 15th NOVEMBER, 2017
President Donald Trump told a fanciful little tale Tuesday about Air Force One being denied landing rights in the Philippines during a trip by his predecessor because bilateral relations were so bad. That didnt happen.
Before boarding the plane in Manila to come home, Trump bragged to the press that hes pushed relations with the Philippines to new heights.
And as you know, we were having a lot of problems with the Philippines, he said. The relationship with the past administration was horrible, to use a nice word. I would say horrible is putting it mildly. You know what happened. Many of you were there, and you never got to land. The plane came close but it didnt land.
That prompted a lot of head-scratching.
President Barack Obama last visited the Philippines in November 2015, arriving in Manila after an overnight flight from Turkey. There were no problems with landing the plane. `Obama used the visit to announce the United States was transferring two ships to the Philippine Navy.
Perhaps Trump was referring erroneously to Obamas aborted meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte In September 2016, Obama abruptly canceled a meeting with the new Philippines leader in Laos after Duterte called him an obscene name. Duterte was warning Obama not to speak with him about the brutality of his crackdown on the illegal drug trade.

## Title: Vasanthi Chathurani  The girl next door

Vasanthi Chathurani  The girl next door
	
Theres a sweet, almost naive sense of innocence in the early performances of Vasanthi Chathurani. Its a new sensibility, to me, since a very few actors here, male or female, have been as able as she has been to project a form of purity that is at once enticing and delicate. Most of our actors are content in entrancing us and forming part of our wildest fantasies.
Vasanthi doesnt get us to think of her like this. More often than not, she wins our sympathy, our deepest fears and sorrows, because shes at home with characters, with daughters, sisters, wives, and mothers, whose main role is to puncture their beauty and sense of charm with a welter of delicateness that can break apart at the slightest intrusion. As Kusum in Gehenu Lamayi and as Nirmala in Ganga Addara  the twin peaks of her early career  she epitomises this kind of female figure so well that she transforms herself into a different acting sensibility, the sensibility I referred to above. 
Its pertinent here to place Vasanthi in a particular context, in our cinema, before moving on to her career. Our actresses more or less continue a tradition begun by Rukmani Devi, a tradition that was passed over to Malini Fonseka in the early seventies. I believe it was Asoka Handagama who observed that Fonsekas characters are definable by their ability to get every man to hanker after her. This is as true for her mainstream ventures as it is for her less commercial essays  Eya Dan Loku Lamayek and Baddegama  and her roles in films that take an intermediate position between the box-office and serious art  including Apeksha and Diyamanthi. She epitomises, not rebellion, but surrender. 
Between the Malini Fonseka of the seventies, who symbolised feminine goodness (largely patriarchal, reflecting the attitudes of popular audiences), and the Swarna Mallawarachchi of the eighties, who symbolised rebellion and retribution, we have Vasanthi Chathurani, who falls into neither category and yet somehow is at home with both. Vasanthis most discernible quality in this respect is her voice, because it can alternate between rebellion and submission.
In Lester James Periess Awaragira, she articulates respect towards their family manor and, later, her love towards a very abusive husband (Lucky Dias), with that voice, signifying the conflict at the heart of her tragedy. But before Awaragira there were other films, all of which followed her transition from the girl next door to a veritable matriarch, and all of which reflected her penchant for delicate beauty. Its the kind of beauty that can waste away at the hands of abuse, which incidentally is her eventual destiny: to be made use of, rather cruelly and unfairly. 
At the end of Gehenu Lamayi, Kusum asks of everyone, including us, Is this my fate The director, Sumitra Peries, resorts to a literal transposition of her imaginings with a dissolve into a carved question mark on a mirror. That was a pretty prescient indication of the type of roles she would be asked to churn out for the next 10 years  in Ganga Addara, in Siribo Aiya, in Parithyagaya, in Adara Hasuna  barring the occasional detour that didnt always seem convincing  particularly in Biththi Hathara, where her depiction of a sensual woman, who seduces the protagonist (Neil Alles) didnt, to me at least, seem congruent with her earlier character portrayals  but sometimes was, as with Para Dige, Siribo Aiya, and Kulageya.
She wins us unconditionally at this point in her career when shes denied proper agency, where forced against her free will to submit to everyone else before herself: the parents and the rich aunt in Gehenu Lamayi, the irate father in Ganga Addara, the tempestuous, almost insanely jealous husband in Adara Hasuna. 
Vasanthis story has been recorded and put down in print so much that I will not go beyond a brief recapitulation of her biography. Born Doreen Peterson in Gampaha, she was educated at Holy Cross College, where she excelled in acting and the arts in general despite the opposition such institutions (it was a Convent) displayed towards girls who get ideas of becoming performers and actresses. She was discovered by Sumitra Peries, in the late seventies, but in those first few days of shooting for Gehenu Lamayi she disappointed if not shocked everyone by her refusal to act in front of the camera. Gehenu Lamayi would have come crumbling down were it not for Lester James Periess idea to shoot another sequence, with her clad in school uniforms, at St John Boscos College in Hatton, where production mercifully proceeded. Gehenu Lamayi was a success, as was Lesters Ahasin Polawata, but it was Ganga Addara that propelled her to stardom. 
She had to be young when playing these characters, obviously, because the submissive women she got to portray couldnt have been portrayed with sincerity were she an elder, a matriarch. She attempted to return to her youth at the turn of the millennium with two movies that showed just how much of a hurdle age was when embodying fragility and sensitivity: H. D. Premaratnes Kinihiriya Mal, where she was a convincing but altogether incongruously cast elder sister to Sangeetha Weeraratne; and Chandran Rutnams Poronduwa, a film that was aptly summed up with respect to its choice of cast members (including Vasanthi along with her love interest, Ravindra Randeniya) by Nanda Pethiyagoda as follows: If I were asked to give a prize, a sort of Oscar, for this latest Sinhala film that is being screened at the Regal and other cinemas, I would award it to the makeup man. Pethiyagoda would write of Vasanthis portrayal, She is no spring chicken, acknowledging that she had captured something of her earlier avatar. 
You come across a faint trace of this new woman even in the eighties, and particularly in Giraya. As Kamini, Vasanthi doesnt inhabit and occupy the plot in the way that her counterpart in Punyakanthe Wijenaikes story (conceived as a series of diary entries, an epistolary novel) does, but her intrusion into that plot rakes up trouble from her mother-in-law (Grace Ariyawimal) and the ominous maid, Lucy Hami (Trilicia Gunawardena). Girayas success owes considerably to the larger texture, the wider scope, which its director, Lester Peries, and scriptwriter, Somaweera Senanayake, brought in and affirmed to take it beyond Kaminis perspective. What happens in the end is that Kamini, far from being the fearful woman the novel depicts her as, triumphs over her fears through her interaction with the other characters: her sister-in-law (Chandani Seneviratne), the gamekeeper (Cyril Dharmawardena), and the village monk (G. R. Perera). Earlier she would have succumbed, yielded; now she persists, like the unnamed protagonist of Du Mauriers Rebecca, and towers over both the mother-in-law and the maid. 
More often than not, she wins our sympathy, our deepest fears and sorrows, because shes at home with characters, with daughters, sisters, wives, and mothers, whose main role is to puncture their beauty and sense of charm
She tries to echo if not channel this kind of rebellious woman in Awaragira, but fails badly, because that is the fate set for her in the plot. Conceived as a vast family epic, Awaragira is rather episodic in its structure: ranging from the stubborn misadventures of the elder son (Kamal Addaraarachchi) to the thwarted idealism and romances of the younger son (Ranjan Ramanayake), its characters shift from one mood to another, from the hopefulness to deterioration and then complete annihilation.
Set against such a large backdrop even Vasanthi changes wildly: in the very first scene shes in, she proclaims her fidelity to the family and her father, but as the plot progresses she finds herself confusingly lost between her love for her family and for her abusive husband. 
Theres a sequence in Awaragira which shows this growing, irreconcilable rift between Vasanthi the girl and Vasanthi the woman. It opens up in the second half of the story, when the family has begun to deteriorate. Awaiting her husband, we see her on a sofa; there are dark spots under her eyes. The wind ruffles her hair, the camera closes in on her, and she gets up after hearing the sound of a car outside. Lucky Dias, cheerful as always, comes up the stairs.
Youre always complaining about me coming home late, so I came early today, he tells her, handing over a cake to her. Without a word, she takes it and prepares to make some tea for him. The husband is bewildered: Vasa What is the problem he asks. She replies with an irresolute shaking of the head. Unconvinced, he tries to allay her fears by caressing her, smiling. She nods, barely. In the next sequence featuring these two, they are no longer smiling and nodding; they are fighting. 
By this time the family fortunes have begun to sink, and in this sequence, brief and superficially unimportant though it is, Vasanthi becomes a new woman, moving away from the idealism of her youth. That she fails to make this shift owing to her naivet proves to be her undoing and her brothers.
In the end she channels the woman beneath her, asserts herself, and kills that brother in a sequence that was so choppily and arbitrarily edited by its producer that it fails to do justice to her; but even with this limitation, the murder reminds me, as I mentioned elsewhere, of the killing of Zhivony in Wajdas Siberian Lady Macbeth, also about a female figure torn between two men. 
By this point in her career she had been repressed so much that she aged beyond her years. Her subsequent career, as a result, would never be the same again: Awaragira coincided with the era in which she began producing tele-dramas, almost all of which (starting with Iti Pahana) had her as a stubborn but well-meaning mother. Its a different Vasanthi we come across here: no longer the girl next door, she has by now embraced the matriarchal figure she was destined to embrace.
Its that matriarchal figure she has now completely been taken over: as a mother, as a sister, as a wife, and of course as a teacher. No longer with that welter of innocence which shrouded her before, she has become the kind of understanding, but determined and assertive person she continues to be today.

Withdraw new tax policy on alcohol: GMOA
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) yesterday urged the government to withdraw the 2018 budget proposal on new tax policy and issue of licence on alcohol with immediate effect.
Addressing a press conference, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said that the procedure to introduce a new tax system and issue of licence on alcohol would create more tendencies among liquor users to consume more alcohol; consequently it would increase the liquor consumption which is now 20% of the total population.
The new proposal on alcohol would provide 40% of tax concessions in importing liquor from abroad and would provide easy access for anyone to put up a liquor shop. We as a responsible union have predetermined the gravity of this issue before the budget was presented to parliament following information received from confidential sources, Dr. Aluthge stated.
He proceeded to say that the new proposal on alcohol had violated article 6.2 and 6.3 underlined in the National Policy on Alcohol Control which was introduced in 2016 by the incumbent regime. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
