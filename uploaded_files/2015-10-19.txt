Arm of the Law loses ear
	
In a curious turn of events, an alleged sex offender whom the police had tried to arrest had bitten off a police sergeant's ear and managed to flee the scene in Thirukkovil yesterday evening.
A team of officers from the Thirukkovil Police Station had gone to an abandoned house in Kanchanakuda following a tip off that a group of wanted persons who were evading courts were hiding there.
They had gone in search of three suspects (a woman and two of her sons), said Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara.
After the policemen arrested the woman and one son the woman's other son had obstructed the policemen and bitten off a sergeant?s ear and fled the scene.
The pain stricken officer was rushed to Thirukkovil Hospital with the severed part of his ear. His condition was not serious.
The pair who were apprehended had been evading court on charges related to rape. They were taken into custody.
A special team was deployed to apprehend the other suspect who is wanted for several sex offences.
The woman is accused of aiding and abetting her sons in various sex crimes, the ASP said. (Kurulu Kariyakarawana)

ATL?s ?Suwasiri? makes health insurance affordable for all Lankans
	
Am?na Takaful?s (ATL) latest product ?Suwasiri? has made its mark in the insurance industry, as the most affordable health policy available in the market.?
This competitively priced, comprehensive insurance plan was designed as part of ATL?s on-going efforts to remain ?open to all? and provide all segments of society with a suitable health insurance solution.
While good health is a blessing, an illness can occur when it is least expected and the financial burden of dealing with such unforeseen events can be overwhelming. The Suwasiri health policy provides an annual insurance cover of Rs.100,000 for as little as Rs.2,222 per year. ?Suwasiri covers administrative fees, doctor consultations as well as medication costs. The policy also covers the cost of hospitalization, surgery, medical treatment, medicine and any medical investigations that are required to determine treatments for ailments. The policy truly offers peace of mind and fulfils a long-felt need in the Sri Lankan market.
Commenting on ATL?s Suwasiri, Manager Business Development Medical Takaful Safwan Hilme stated, ?At ATL we strive to continuously meet the needs of our customers. In times of poor health, the Suwasiri health insurance policy will assist policyholders and their loved ones by covering the cost of hospitalization and by providing them with other important benefits. The health of our valued customers is extremely important to us and we firmly believe that with today?s rising medical treatment and hospitalization costs, Sri Lankans from all walks of life should have access to a health insurance policy.?
?The consequence of not having a medical insurance policy is that one will have to dip into savings, borrow or use the money set aside for other specific requirements, to meet unforeseen medical expenses. We encourage everyone to consider insurance as the solution and use their savings to achieve more important things in life,? Hilme further stated.
The Suwasiri policy addresses the challenges that people face when unexpected medical emergencies occur. Amidst the increasing cost of medical care, hospitalization and treatments, the Suwasiri health insurance policy from ATL is a perfect solution for Sri Lankans seeking affordable security and comfort in times of medical uncertainty. Suwasiri provides additional benefits such as cover forward charges in private hospitals for up to 10 days. Theatre charges, surgeons? fees, anaesthetists? fees as well as specialist charges are all included in the cover for Sri Lankan?s who are 18 to 55 years of age. Additionally, Suwasiri covers examinations fees, x-rays, scans and MRIs. A cover for hospitalization is also provided. If hospitalization occurs at a government hospital a cash grant of Rs.500 per day is provided for a maximum of 21 days including expenses for prescribed medicine that has to be purchased.?
Suwasiri bagged the Bronze award in the ?Product of the Year? category, at the Sri Lanka Islamic Banking and Finance Industry awards 2014, for its innovative and unique features and benefits.

CA allows to record Army Chief?s, MI's statements
	
	The Court of Appeal today issued an order directing the Homagama Magistrate to summon Army Commander A.W.J.C. de Silva and the Director of Military Intelligence Corps and other officers to inquire and record evidence in respect of the ongoing inquiry into the disappearance of veteran journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda.
	The Bench comprising Justices Vijith K. Malalgoda (President) and H.C.J. Madawala issued this order pursuant to a motion filed on behalf of Ekneligoda?s wife.
	Court also granted permission to include these army officers as added respondents in the Habeas Corpus writ application and issued notice on them returnable for October 30.
	The motion states that the petitioners are reliably informed of several developments in the matter that have a direct bearing and connection to this application.
	It states that several army officers have direct knowledge and information as to the whereabouts and the disappearance of Ekneligoda who had gone missing on January 24, 2010.
	The motion requests that it is necessary to include these army officers as added respondents.
	The then Attorney General and then Advisor to the Cabinet, Mohan Peiris, in a statement issued to the UN Committee against Torture on November 9, 2011 had claimed that Prageeth Ekneligoda had not disappeared but was residing abroad.
	The Habeas Corpus petition was filed on February 19, 2010 by his wife K.M.S.P. Ekniligoda and their two children Bandara Ekniligoda and Sooriyia Ekniligoda.
	The petitioners cited CID DIG Nandana Munasinghe, Homagama Police OIC, IGP Mahinda Balasooriya, the Attorney General and the missing journalist Prageeth Ekniligoda as respondents.
	Chrishmal Warnasuriya appeared for the petitioners while Additonal Solicitor General Shavindra Fernando with State Counsel Shamindra Wickrama appeared for the State.
	The petition is seeking a writ order from the Court directing the Police to produce Prageeth Ekneligoda before the Court of Appeal.
	The petition is also seeking a writ order to be issued to the IGP, the CID DIG and the Homagama Police OIC, who have been cited as respondents.
	The petition states that while remaining within the legal framework, Ekneligoda highlighted the political situation in the country at the time.
	The petition states that Ekneligoda had supported General Sarath Fonseka as the then common opposition candidate.
	It states that Ekneligoda is being held under unlawful custody or detention with the knowledge of the respondents or by others for the reasons set out in the petition.
	It states that since October 2009, Ekniligoda had been receiving threatening telephone calls from unidentified persons at times threatening bodily harm and even his life.
	The petition states that on August 27, 2009 around 12.30 p.m. while on his way home from Dambulla, he was kidnapped by several persons believed to be underground forces operating illegally for and on behalf of the several highly placed officials.
	The kidnappers had their faces covered and had taken him away in a white van.
	It states Ekneligoda was blindfolded, stuffed under a seat with the kidnappers firmly placing their feet on him, thus not allowing him to see or move. (S.S. Selvanayagam)

Experts hail CITS benefits at BASL seminar
	
Organized by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Judges Institute & Clearing Association of Bankers (CAB), the seminar on Cheque Imaging & Truncation System (CITS) and New Banking Systems was held on 3rd of October ?at the Kingsbury Hotel.
?Among the prestigious participants were K. Kanag-Ishvaran, the President?s Counsel who delivered the seminar?s keynote address, Jonathan Alles, MD/CEO of HNB who was also part of the panel which addressed the audience on the topic of new practices in Banking and what the future holds and the General Manager/CEO of Lanka Clear, Sunimal Weerasooriya who made a detailed presentation under the topic ?The Evolution of Cheque Clearing in Sri Lanka? and current issues.?
??The unassuming simplicity of the modern cheque belies the centuries worth of legal and operational experimentation that have contributed to its transformation from a Bill of Exchange to its current form. When seen in this perspective it is easy to appreciate the immense contribution of the ?cheque? towards the development of negotiable instruments, money transfer and banking as we recognize them today,? said Kanag-Ishvaran PC whilst describing the history of cheque usage.?
He further went on to describe the workings of the Cheque Imaging and Truncation System in this way; ?The Cheque Imaging & Truncation System is designed to accept physical cheques or images and MICR data of physical cheques by direct electronic transfer. Banks generate images of cheques for outward delivery and submit cheque data and images. As such, the physical movement of cheques is truncated at the point of image capture and hence, the paying bank will not receive a physical cheque during the entire clearing process.??
?Alles provided the audience with a detailed description of his view on the current developments in the banking industry when it comes to the use of cheques and the extent to which banks perform transactions based on the electronic image of the cheque. ?At present cheques are scanned by the banks as per the Lanka Clear specifications and retained within the systems of the bank. Hence the integrity of the cheque images is ensured.
There are certain regions i.e. Europe, Australia etc. that have introduced applications for the customer to scan the cheque by using a smart phone and push to the respective bank for clearing. However, control remains with the paying bank for cheque number matching and signature verification.
Advance payments and cash management systems have more control as banks print the cheques on behalf of the customer and the paying bank will always have a record of the amount, payee, date, value and cheque number of each cheque. This completely eliminates the risks of alteration compared to a standard practice of issuing cheque-books where banks will have no record about the payee, amount and date until the presentment.?
Alles further stated that he expected the legal fraternity ?to update the necessary laws and regulations to support Sri Lanka?s digital transformation journey? to aid the promotion of the use the CITS.?
In his presentation Weerasooriya named several key benefits the cheque imaging and truncation system offers to customers as well as to banks.?
??The originally operated 10 Regional Centers to provide scanning facilities to Banks were discontinued in July 2010 and all banks took over the function of cheque scanning further improving the efficiency of the process? said Weerasooriya whilst explaining the subsequent improvements made to the CITS. He also added, ?CRN Printing by LankaClear was discontinued in July 2014 and the Presenting Banks took over the function of CRN printing?.
?In conclusion Weerasooriya listed some of the major difficulties faced by Lanka Clear due to the CITS not achieving the awareness and attention required.?

GAAM crosses Rs.5 bn mark in assets under management
	
Guardian Acuity Asset Management Ltd, which manages three unit trusts, passed an important milestone in its short history when it crossed the Rs 5 billion mark in assets under management (AUM) in early October this year.?
The firm which was recognised as the ?Best new asset management company in Sri Lanka 2014? by the prestigious Banking and Finance Review magazine continues to break new ground in 2015 as well.?
Guardian Acuity Asset Management Limited (GAAM) is a joint venture between Acuity Partners (Pvt) Ltd and Ceylon Guardian Investment Trust PLC. Ceylon Guardian Investment Trust PLC manages over Rs. 33 billion in assets and is a listed subsidiary of the diversified conglomerate Carson Cumberbatch PLC. ?Acuity Partners (Pvt) Ltd is the joint venture Investment Bank promoted by banking giants Hatton National Bank PLC and DFCC Bank PLC.?
GAAM launched its gilt edged money market fund in March 2015 building on the success of its equity fund and its fixed income fund, which have been in operation since 2012. The firm?s equity fund has, up to September, returned 3.29 percent to its unit holders in a year when the All Share Index of the Colombo Stock Exchange has declined 3.4 percent in the same period. ?
The more sensitive S&P SL 20 of most traded stocks was down 6.43 percent in the comparable period in 2015. This is an out performance of 6.69 percent and 9.73 percent against the benchmark indices of the CSE. From its launch date, the Equity Fund has returned on average 17.74 percent p.a. well above the benchmark All Share Index.
The AUM of the equity fund has grown 256% YTD ?for the year , while the AUM of the Fixed Income fund has grown 113%. The newer Gilt edge fund has assets under management of over Rs. 800 million in management.
Mohandas Thangarajah the General Manager of GAAM thanked the loyal clients of the company for continuing to place their trust and their investments with GAAM. ?I have a small but dedicated team that offers personalised solutions to all our clients and continuously seeks to improve on service quality. Without our clientele and my team this would have not been possible ?he further said.?
Sumith Perera who manages the three funds said that ?With interest rates increasing after being at historic lows over the last few years, our money market funds provide a very convenient and attractive return proposition for investors who want to capture the increase in rates. ?The credit quality of the fund is of a very high calibre with each company going through a thorough evaluation process prior to investing. ?The equity fund has taken its key exposures in the banking sector, food and beverage sector and diversified sector. ?We expect these identified stocks to significantly outpace the rest of the stock market in the medium term. ?By using a disciplined investment approach where companies with attractive growth prospects, strong management and sound financials are selected, the fund is able to provide exceptional returns to investors.? ?
Ruvini Fernando, CEO of Guardian Fund Management stated that ?The unit trust industry is at a critical stage in its development in this country. In an environment where affluence is increasing and savers are transforming into savvy investors, the accessibility of capital markets products adds variety and depth to people?s investment choices. We look forward to continued policy level support for the industry in the light of the need for better retirement savings products for our ageing population; as well as in the broad-basing and democratisation of capital markets by making stocks, bonds and debentures easily accessible to the public. Unit trusts have the ability to achieve both objectives sensibly.?

Audio: Jana rejects Sumanthiran?s claim on demo in Paris
	
Eastern Provincial Councillor Govindan Karunakaran (Jana) of TELO today rejected the claim of TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran that those who protested in France and disrupted a TNA meeting were people who had been victims of TELO.
A meeting attended by TNA MPs Selvam Adaikalanathan, A. K. Kodiswaran, Northern Provincial Councillor M.K. Sivajilingam and Councillor Karunakaran held at a restaurant in La Chapelle, Paris on October 9 was disrupted by a group of protestors.
When contacted by the Daily mirror MP Sumanthiran quoting MP Adaikalanathan said that those who had protested were people allegedly harassed by the military and TELO in the 1990s and their family associates.
He also said the protestors had accused Councillor Karunakaran of excesses against them in the 90s.
However, rejecting the claim Karunakaran said that he had no connection of the nature as claimed by Sumanthiran.
?We were attending a meeting in La Chapelle to explain the current political situation in Sri Lanka and about the resolution adopted by the UNHRC,? Jana said.
?As the meeting was proceeding, we heard a tense situation outside. One of the participants at the meeting went outside and he returned claiming several individuals were picketing outside the restaurant. We invited the protestors as well to discuss the matter,? he said.
He said two men in their thirties had entered the restaurant and scolded him for leaving the country for the UK back then.
?A member of Voice of Tigers, the LTTE?s pirate broadcast, and a former intelligence member of the LTTE were the two who shouted against me.
?They accused me of leaving the country amidst LTTE threats, as if being on the hit list of the LTTE was a good thing. They are the members of a group which clandestinely collects money from Tamils in Europe forcibly,? Jana said.
?The two just made me a target in their attempt to prevent us from explaining the peaceful situation in Sri Lanka. If people knew the real situation, they would stop giving money to these groups,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

?Seylan Thilina Sayura? is a distinctive scheme offering a range of both monetary and non-monetary benefits to account holders on significant occasions in their life while earning interest from foreign currency accounts.?
Seylan Bank adhering to its core promise as the bank with a heart, sensing the pulse of its customers, is the only bank offering a large range of benefits to the hard working migrant community of the country. ?Aligning with the Government?s initiative of enabling Sri Lankan migrants in countries such as Britain, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and France to apply for dual citizenship, Seylan Bank paves a path for them to enjoy the best of both countries. Customers maintaining a required balance for 3 years in their Seylan NRFC or SFIDA accounts will be entitled to apply for dual citizenship while enjoying the benefits offered by the bank.
The 2014 Annual Report of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka cited the total number of departures for foreign employment has shown a significant growth by 2.5 percent compared to 2013.

SL to allow Chinese submarines to visit: PM
	
Sri Lanka will allow future submarine visits by China provided they are not too frequent, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said underlining that the mistrust with India in the past could have been avoided if it had been kept in the picture about the dockings.
?We have put out the criterion for visits by naval ships. Under that, ships including submarines from all countries can visit Sri Lanka. As far as we are concerned if it is a friendly visit we will inform the neighbouring countries and we will spread out the frequency of the visits,? he told The Straits Times.
?The problem with the last visit by a Chinese submarine was that India claims it was not informed. So far, from what we found out, that seems to be correct,? the Singapore daily quoted Wickremesinghe.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has suggested that some of the mistrust could have been avoided if India had been kept in the picture about the visit by the Chinese submarine, which was en route to deployment in the Gulf of Aden.
Wickremesinghe, ended a four-day visit to Singapore. He met Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy PM Tharman Shanmugaratnam, and other ministers during the visit. He offered a cautious assessment of relations with New Delhi, saying "ties with India are improving".
In future, Sri Lanka will set out definite criteria for calls by foreign naval ships.

Video: Sex workers seek legal recognition
	
An organization calling itself the Centre for Sex Worker?s Rights (CSWR) today requested President Maithripala Sirisena to legalise their occupation and provide them legal recognition so that they could continue with their profession without any hindrance.
CSWR Co-President B. Maheshwari said those who criticized their profession had neglected to look into how and why sex workers had been forced into this situation.
?I?m here in this occupation today because of my husband. If he hadn?t abandoned me and our two kids, I wouldn?t have to do this. Husbands should learn not to leave their wives. When a girl is helpless, men try to take advantage of her and ruin her life. It?s not the government or the police who are helping us to make ends meet. I?m doing this to feed my children and to educate them,? she told a news conference.
She charged the police were arresting them for a fine of Rs. 100 and putting them in jails for one and a half month. ?What people don?t know is that police come to us the day before they arrest us and pay us for the service and the next day they arrest us. When we are in jail for a month, there is no one to look after our kids. This is why we request the President to provide us some concession and to legalise the occupation,? she said.
Addressing the news conference, political activist Wikramabahu Karunaratne said a legal immunity was needed to protect sex workers from those who are suppressing them and treating them like slaves.
CSWR National Organiser Attorney Senaka Perera said the Vagrants Ordinance of Sri Lanka should be abolished which allows the police to arrest a woman only for standing by herself at a bus halt but not a man for the very same reason.
?Most of these workers are not engaged in the occupation willingly but the police approach towards them is very inhumane. Today, even Ministers considers about the appearance when hiring a secretary and they might also have to act as sex workers,? he said adding that they were not attempting to promote the occupation but only attempting to protect sex workers.
?Their rights are also human rights,? he said.
Meanwhile, Sakuni Mayadunne who is a transgender, requested the President to facilitate a mechanism to change their Identity cards once they underwent sex change. She said she had to face many difficulties because she could not change her ID after the sex change.
?If politicians can seek our votes and it means something, what?s stopping them from accepting us? We too are human? she said. (Lahiru Pothmulla and Sanath Desmond)Video by Buddika
