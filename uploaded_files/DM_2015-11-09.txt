BASL against summoning AG before House
	
The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) today came out strongly against statements that the Attorney General should be summoned before Parliament over the Avant Garde issue.
"Whilst the legislative supremacy of parliament is respected, summoning persons before parliament to explain the legitimacy of their official acts for which there can be recourse to other alternative legitimate mechanisms could seriously undermine the independence and integrity required of such public functionaries and result in the office itself being the subject of public ridicule," a statement by the bar Association President Geoffrey Alagaratnam said.
It said that levelling unfair and unfounded allegations are inconsistent with legitimate criticism and can only lead to an erosion of the credibility of the institutions or offices in which such persons function.
Excerpts of the statement:
The Bar association of Sri Lanka (BASL), notes with concern the spate of and growing vilification and personal attacks on the members of the judiciary and on the Attorney General and officers of the said Department which has been given wide publicity in the media.
It is the right of the public to objectively criticize the actions of judicial officers and public officers in a functioning democracy. It is also the right of citizens in challenge such action an appropriate forum.
However it is important that such criticism not be based on allegations which are unfounded, without any basis and which unfairly attribute personal motives to public functionaries for their actions, in such a manner that they are unable to respond to the same.
The BASL is also concerned that as was previously contemplated against the Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (Bribery Commission) that there have been suggestions that the Attorney General be summoned to parliament in connection with orders or decisions related to the functions of his office.
The BASL also notes that It is important for the judiciary and the Attorney Generals Department to take note of the fact that over a period of time there has been a serious erosion of public confidence in institutions administering justice. It is the duty of all concerned including judges and officers of the Attorney Generals Department as well as members of the unofficial Bar, to help restore public confidence in these institutions.

I will sue Wijeyadasa for five billion rupees: SF
	
	Democratic Party leader, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, said he would sue Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe for defamation and claim Rs. five billion as compensation.
	He said so at one of a series of awareness programmes conducted by his party, on Saturday, at the Oasis Hotel in Minuwangoda.
	"Field Marshal is a title given to a person of standing. It is only second to that of president. Persons rejected by the people as drug racketeers and extortioners have been made MPs. They are also part of the government," he said.
	Our party supporters were disappointed by the results of the last general election. The reason for our lack of success was that we contested alone -- without making alliances. In this series of meetings, we will make the people aware of our reasons for not entering into alliances, he said.
	He said Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was seeking Rs. 500 million from him because he said the government was protecting robbers. "I only get a pension of Rs.50,000. How can I pay him Rs.500 million" he asked.
	"Education is not a necessary qualification for politics. But all who enter politics should be honest and able to understand the peoples aspirations," he said.
	The seminar was organised by the chief party organisers, Upul Nilantha of Minuwangoda, Sumeda Jayawardena of Katana and Nihal Silva of Divulapitiya.
	Provincial council members Indika Bandara and Anuruddha Lekamge were also present at the meeting.(Pushpakumara Mallawaarachchi)

Maldives Criminal Court has again extended the remand of the Sri Lankan sniper arrested in Maldives allegedly hired and brought into the country as part of a plot to assassinate President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom, Haveeru online said.
Confirming the arrest for the first time, police said in a statement Saturday that the 27-year-old man was arrested on October 24. He has been remanded by the Criminal Court for 15 days, the police added.
The police, however, did not reveal any further details. Maldivian authorities, however, neither confirmed nor denied the arrest at the time.
Meanwhile, Sri Lankas Daily Mirror newspaper quoted the countrys defence ministry as saying Friday that the sniper in question was not attached to the Sri Lankan military.
Some Sri Lankan media outlets have even reported that the man was an importer of Maldives dry fish.
The Sunday Times identified the sniper as 24-year-old Lahiru Madhushanka.Maldives police showcase on October 31, 2015 several weapons including an assault rifle seized during a raid on an island in Baa Atoll, which is being developed as a resort, in connection to the blast aboard the presidential speedboat in September.
Reports of the Sri Lankan snipers arrest came a day after Maldivian security forces confiscated assault rifles and hand guns in what has been the biggest weapons bust in the countrys history. The weapons had been seized from Hibilhadhoo Island in Baa Atoll being developed as a resort.
The army had confirmed that two assault rifles found in the weapons bust belonged to the state armoury.
The items showcased during a press conference last week included several hand guns, a T56 assault rifle and a MP5 sub-machine gun. In addition, a large quantity of bomb making materials was also displayed at the press briefing.

	Resignation of Law and Order Minister Tilak Marapana will not solve the matters with regard to Avant Garde case, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.
	JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake at a media briefing said Minister of Justice Wijedasa Rajapakse is also an offender in the case. Mr. Dissanayake therefore questioned as how Minister Rajapakse got to know about the details pertaining to the revenue earned by Avant Garde. Why couldnt the Navy handle the floating armory if it was a lucrative business Mr. Dissanayake asked while referring to the statements made by Mr. Rajapakse recently in Parliament. Also he said the Minister of Justice tried to prevent the recent debate in Parliament on the case and therefore he too faces same charges as Mr. Marapana.
	The JVP Leader dismissed the statement made by Mr. Rajapakse on the former Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa that there is no need for the latters arrest. Therefore Mr. Dissanayake said former Defense Secretary should be arrested forthwith.
	Further the JVP leader denied the claims made by the former Defense Secretary that the JVPers wanted Front Line Socialist Party (FLSP) leader Kumar Gunaratnam should be abducted. We never wanted Mr. Gunaratnam abducted, he said while mentioning that Mr. Rajapaksa by his statement had admitted that he was involved in abductions. (Yohan Perera)

My pension was Rs.25,000: Chandrika
	
	Former president Chandrika Kumaratunga said she received a pension of Rs. 25,000 per month until Cabinet increased it to Rs. 98,500, last week.
	She said that the president's salary was Rs. 25,000 when she first took office as president in 1994, and it had not been increased when she completed her term in 2005. However, she said ministers' salaries had been increased from Rs. 14,000 in 1994 to Rs. 35,000, in the hope that they would not be susceptible to bribery.
	She said the ministers' salaries were again increased to Rs. 60,000, while her salary (as president) and that of the then prime minister (her mother Sirimavo Bandaranaike) had remained Rs. 25,000 and Rs.20,000 respectively.
	"The pension of the president is based on the last salary he or she drew and, consequently, my pension remained unchanged at Rs. 25,000 until last week, while former president Mahinda Rajapaksa had had his salary increased to Rs. 98,000, and even the former MPs drew pensions of Rs. 40,000," she said.
	Ms. Kumaratunga said that several letters had been sent to the then president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, by her office requesting an increase in her pension, but his secretary, Lalith Weeratunga had sent her three replies rejecting her request.
	It was only after President Maithripala Sirisena came to office that her request was granted, she said.

	Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila today claimed that Law and Order Minister Thilak Marapana had to resign from his portfolio under the directions of Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe because he disclosed the truth in Parliament last week, when he said that the Police raided Avant Garde ship in January to score points.
	He said that former minister Marapana was pressurized from several parties to resign after he made the controversial statement regarding the Avant Garde issue.
	Speaking on the due release of prisoners held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), MP Gammanpila said it would cause a dangerous situation in the country since the prisoners named Moris and Giri who were suspected to have planned the suicide bombings targeted former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka would also be released.
	Meanwhile, responding to a question posed by a journalist on summoning of Dilrukshi Gammanpila, the wife of MP Gammanpila to the Special Investigations Unit of Police (SIU), he said even if his wife is imprisoned or abducted, he would not quit politics.
	Dilrukshi Gammanpila was today questioned by the SIU to get a statement with regard to the allegations were made against her husband stating that he had brought down a bankrupt businessman from Australia, used the power-of-attorney privilege to sell his shares worth 100,000 dollars.
	This is not the first time my family members were levelled indirect threats from several parties who want me to quit politics. Previously, my children were threatened that they would be killed unless I left the country. But, I did not. I am not such a person who does politics with the intention of looking after the family. Even if my wife is abducted or imprisoned, nobody can stop my journey, he said.
	He said that it was quite funny as his wife too had to join with the other politicians wives who were earlier summoned and questioned by the police over several allegations. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Tug-of-war for NDDCB Chair continues
	
	The tug-of-war for post of National Dangerous Drugs Control Board (NDDCB) Chairman is continuing without a proper solution with newly appointed Chairman former DIG Sirisena Herath being unable to assume duties because incumbent Chairman Nilanga Samarasinghe is refusing to vacate his post.
	Dr. Samarasinghe said he had not received any instructions either in writing or orally regarding the appointment of a new chairman and as such would continue to function in the post. He said he would continue in his post claiming he had been instructed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to do so.
	I carried out a massive campaign against illegal drugs and narcotics for more than ten years and racketeers are now up in arms against me. Former DIG Sirisena Herath has been appointed as Chairman creating a crisis when I was away from the country to attend an international conference. Law and Order Ministry Secretary Jagath Wijeweera had clearly misused his powers by making this appointment, he said.
	Former DIG Herath who was appointed Chairman last Thursday, rejected claims by its incumbent Chairman Samarasinghe that he had not been informed beforehand about the appointment of the new Chairman.
	Mr. Herath said he was appointed on the approval of both the President and the Prime Minister and that Ministry Secretary had informed Dr. Samarasinghe in a fax that a new chairman was being appointed on October 5. He said the secretary had also noted his appreciation on the contribution made by Dr. Samarasinghe to the NDDCB.
	The government requested me for a CV and I sent one to the Prime Ministers office. Prime Ministers secretary had referred the CV to a committee which appoints heads to departments and boards. Even the Law and Order Minister had recommended my CV to this committee. Later on Presidents Secretary had instructed Law and Order Ministry Secretary to appoint me as the Chairman on the Presidents approval, he said.
	He said he hoped the matter would be resolved at the special Cabinet meeting held last morning. However, Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said the Cabinet had discussed the matter but no final decision was taken. (Lahiru Pothmulla and Sanara Ariyatileka)

	Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera today called for a Sanghadikaranaya - a special court to hear cases of Buddhist monks.
	He expressed these views outside the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court where a case was filed against him on defaming the Quran.
	We havent committed any crime. Its not like we have killed someone, raped anyone or robbed anyone. These charges had been levelled for defending the Sangha and the dates of the cases keep extending. We have so many invasive forces in the country today which are against Buddhism. But it seems even the Mahanayakas are silent on these matters. Thats why we need a Sanghadikaranaya. Its high time that we do away with worn out British laws, the Prelate said.
	Meanwhile, Ven. Watareka Vijitha Thera, whose news conference was obstructed by Gnanasara Thera, said no charges had been filed so far by the police against the prelate though it has been two years since the incident.
	However, we are happy that at least we have a country free of criminals today. I hope justice will be served immediately, the Thera said.

Dismissing various statements that the proposal to remove the administration of EPF fund from the purview of the Central Bank would create a safety issue, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Harsha De Silva today said the proposed move would only ensure more security to the fund.
The Minister told a media briefing that the new move would end the ongoing conflicts of interests.
"Whenever the government borrows funds from the EPF it is done through the Debt Department of Central Bank and the monies are borrowed from a fund which is under the Central Bank itself and these results in a Conflict of Interest," he said.
Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera who elaborated on the administration of the new retirement gratuity fund that would be set up by merging the EPF and ETF said it would be administered by a Board of Directors appointed by the Constitutional Council.
He also said representatives of the employees would also be included on the board of directors.(Yohan Perera and Darshana Sanjeewa)

President, PM to decide on Avant Garde
	
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are to decide within the next two days whether to pursue the Avant Garde Maritime Security Service case, it is learnt.
The President held a special Cabinet meeting to discuss this matter today after Ministers Patali Champika Ranawaka, Rajitha Senaratne and Arjuna Ranatunga called for the resignation of Law and Order Minister Tilak Marapana alleging that he was dilly dallying with the case.
Minister Marapana submitted his resignation from his portfolio this morning.
At the special Cabinet meeting, Dr. Senaratne said there was enough evidence against Avant Garde and former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
President Sirisena said he had not studied this matter in detail because it was a not subject that came under his purview but that he would discuss the new steps to be taken at a meeting with the Prime Minister and the investigating officials in the wake of the Law and Order Minister Marapana's resignation.
