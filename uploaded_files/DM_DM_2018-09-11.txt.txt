A guideline to Sinhala writers Yasawardhana Rodrigo produces his  latest book Waharamu Hondin Vimas
	

Language is indeed one of most essential and powerful communication devices for all mankind. Different countries and different nations have different languages. 
In Sri Lanka, the Sinhala language has been the mother tongue of the Sinhala nation for over 2500 years. 
Our Language is regarded as an Indo Aryan language, which has diversified its original identity by entangling with modern Portuguese, Dutch, English and Tamil versions. 
Nevertheless over the past 2500 years the Sinhala language maintained its national characteristics according to strict grammatical principles. With the rapid development of technological devices people have lethargically adopted a colloquial way of writing. Some of the modern writers are either unconcerned or ignorant of grammatical rules. They ignore and also seem to be satisfied if they could merely communicate or express their views and opinions in whatever manner they wish. 
At present radio, tv and other electronic media as well as print media, is infested with such unruly short cut methods. 
Hence, the very essence of our mother tongue is gradually depressed and endangered. Day by day, due to the negligence of the true and original identity of our own mother tongue, the Sinhala language is going from bad to worse. 
Yasawardhana Rodrigo, a veteran journalist and author of over 40 books, with the purpose of boosting moral ethics and social values has taken yet another giant step to publish his latest text<U+0DC0><U+0DC4><U+0DBB><U+0DB8><U+0DD4> <U+0DC4><U+0DDC><U+0DB3><U+0DD2><U+0DB1><U+0DCA> <U+0DC0><U+0DD2><U+0DB8><U+0DC3><U+0DCF>.
It is indeed a timely medication to safeguard the life and style of Sri Lankan Language. 
It also conveys a valuable lesson to all those who wish to write Sinhala scripts accurately and avoid being subjected to humiliation and ridicule in the eyes of intelligent readers.

Bald Army Commander looks like Idi Amin: SF
	
The rift between Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and Army Commander Mahesh Senanayaka escalated again with the Field Marshal drawing similarities between the Army Commander and Idi Amin because of their choice of bald hairstyle.
The Army Commander acts with a distorted mind. He should know how to maintain his hair like a respected public officer. He is bald, like Idi Amin," he told journalists after attending an event in Kelaniya on Monday.
The Field Marshal was responding to Army Chief Lieutenant General Senanayakes statement on Sunday in which he said that no one could review the Army's strength after having gone on retirement years ago.
Lieutenant General Senanayake said some retired military officers who have identified themselves as War-Analysts had defined the Armys right-sizing programme as s closure of camps.
Field Marshal Fonseka told journalists that the Army Commander was only a Brigadier when he was leading the war.
If he thinks he knows more than us, he is just sitting on his tail. He was appointed as the Army Commander not because of his talent, but because of other people's mistakes, he said.

Behind a costly door!
	
Believe it or not! A lady holding a top office in the upcountry health service has got a door worth Rs. 1 million for her office room.
When there are complaints galore about the shortage of a variety of items essential for providing a satisfactory health care service to the people, this female high-up has procured every possible facility and comfort for her office room liberally spending the public funds.
This female high-up, known to be a close pal of a powerful political authority, has functioned in the present high post so long she seems to have become a permanent fixture here, they say.

Bribery Commission is full of corruption: Maithri Gunaratne
	
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption which was established to inquire into corruption was full of corruption, United National Freedom Front Secretary Maithri Gunaratne charged.
The Director General and couple of Commissioners of the Commission are reported to have purchased three Mercedes Benz cars worth Rs. 4.5 million each on rent basis in such scenario where they have been provided with three luxury vehicles by the Commission. It is utterly misappropriation of public funds, Gunaratne told a news briefing today.
The other funny thing is that although these three newly purchased cars are electric motor cars, it was reported that they still get the fuel allowance granted by the commission, he said.
On the other hand, there is an official in the commission who frequently goes abroad in the first class or the business class. According to the information we gathered from an official of the commission, he goes overseas to buy sweets and other food items for his family members, he added.
He said it was the funds of the people that were being used for these journeys.
Nevertheless, he said the Director General of the Commission used to spend funds between Rs. 6mn to Rs. 7mn to get his office cabin repaired.
Is this we should expect of a commission like this which has been placed to investigate corruption and bribery They should set an example for others instead of involving in misappropriation of public finds, he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Building national harmony: A cardinal duty of the Govt.
	
A Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) on Building National Harmony has been appointed on Friday following a motion to that effect which was passed in Parliament last Wednesday. 
Despite national harmony in the country or reconciliation -- as it is called -- in the recent times being a long sought situation the news about this Parliamentary Select Committee did not seem to have created any enthusiasm among the people in general and minority communities in particular who are at the receiving end whenever the peace and harmony among communities are disturbed.
This is nothing but the lack of trust on the peace efforts made by government or non-governmental entities for the past four decades. The situation in the country is such that the peace efforts are looked at by both the people of the south as well as north with suspicion or ridicule. Also, interestingly those efforts have always been stimulus of fresh controversies and certain southern politicians have created a situation where even the word reconciliation is being hated or ridiculed. 
Earlier we have had two PSCs -- one during President Ranasinghe Premadasas tenure and the other during the Chandrika Kumaratunga regime- round table conferences, All Party Conferences and peace talks with armed rebels since 1984, for the same purpose, and a huge amount of tax payers money had been spent on them. But all have gone down the drain with nobody or no entity being prepared to take the responsibility for any such effort or its failure. 
The present government has given or pretends to give an elevated place for peace, national harmony and reconciliation in the process of governance. It is such a prominent place that it has been a major concern in the governments constitution making process and the very place, in turn, has become a stumbling block in that process. 
Governments concern about peace and communal harmony is being well manifested by the number of entities -- ministries and other organizations -- that have been formed by it, apart from the PSC appointed last week. One of the initial steps that were taken by the government on its assumption of office in January, 2015 was the creation of two ministries charged with the responsibility of bringing in much needed peace and harmony. The Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation has been placed under President Maithripala Sirisena, indicating the top priority that has been given by the government to national harmony while another ministry, the Ministry of National Coexistence, Dialogue and Official Languages has been assigned to Mano Ganesan, a minority leader. 
Apart from this, two more bodies namely, the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) and the Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms (SCRM) have been established for the same purpose, in the wake of the present government assumed office in 2015. ONUR was the result of a resolution which was moved by the Prime Minister; approved by the Cabinet and was Established under President, chaired by Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
The SCRM seems to have stemmed from the resolutions adopted by the UNHRC on Sri Lanka. Mano Tittawella is the Secretary General of the SCRM, which is entrusted with coordinating transitional justice mechanisms in Sri Lanka such as the Office of Missing Persons (OMP), Truth Seeking Commission, Accountability Mechanism and Office for Reparations -- some of which are yet to be set up. 
However, we did not see any of these ministries or bodies being in action or at least on the ground when the canard on contraceptive pills was spread after several Muslim owned properties were torched in February or when anti-Muslim riots were unleashed in several towns in the Kandy District in March. Neither did we see these entities when the Northern Provincial Council passed resolutions that provoked Sinhalese sentiments nor when Tamil politicians such as Vijayakala Maheshwaran called for the resurrection of the LTTE. 
Instead, the ONUR itself is in a midst of a controversy over its inappropriate usage of wordings in some of the radio dramas it had sponsored, in the name of reconciliation. Unless the latest Parliamentary Select Committee takes these matters into consideration it also would be another body further burdening the public coffers, in the name of reconciliation.

Gay rights: Time to follow India!
	
LGBT activists celebrate after Indian Supreme court delivered a verdict in favour of gay rights

Last week, Indias Supreme Court decriminalized homosexuality, finally burying for good an archaic colonial era law that imposed a maximum penalty of life imprisonment for consensual gay sex. The Judges described the Section 377 of the Penal Code, that was first introduced in 1861 asirrational, indefensible and manifestly arbitrary. Rather than just scrapping the old law, the Supreme Court went further, granting the LGBTQ members the guarantees of equal protection under the constitution.One member of the five Judge bench said the society owed a collective apology to LGBTQ community for the prolonged denial of their due rights. 
That was a landmark judgement. Given the scale of India, this is also by far the biggest victory for gay rights anywhere in the world in recent times. Indian triumph has also created a historic opportunity for her neighbours and has set a judicial precedent for their less activist courts. Sri Lankan civil society and liberal law makers should grab this opportunity, before enthusiasm and public empathy fade away. 
Indias long battle for gay rights offers both inspiration and a snippet of myriad hurdles that laid on its way. The Section 377 implanted from the Victorian England penalized anyone who voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal. When India emerged as an independent state, Indias new rulers were overly eager to sever the appendage to their colonial history. But they kept the vestige colonial law, perhaps an understandable decision in an overwhelming conservative society, and a world beset by homophobia. Still, Indias choice was a mismatch to Nehrus loftier goals of social justice. ( Much later in the 50s, the British courts hounded Alan Turing, a pioneering computer scientist and World War II code breaker, for being homosexual, and had him chemically castrated, leading him to commit suicide.) 
However, in the 60s and 70s much of the Europe and later America went through a sexual revolution and came to terms with the variance of sexual orientation. Since then, the world, at least a part of it, has come a long way, leaving behind overt homophobia that provoked Stonewall riots to a place that is increasingly accepting of same sex marriages. 
Newly independent countries of Asia and Africa lagged in this process. Due to existential reasons, their societies failed to harness individual rights. Their misplaced statist and pseudo socialist economic models stifled economic development, the primary driver of empowerment of the citizenry. Urbanization, another long term driver of individual freedoms was absent or marred by a sea of slums. 
In their unholy rush for popular empowerment, those countries put the cart before the horse. By overstating the perceived merits of the political empowerment of a populace who had been living hand to mouth off the government food rations, their political leaders effectively created a large captive electorate of poor, the semi-literate and despondent. In these skewed societies, conservative majoritarian morality espoused by the religious and cast elites dictated the social discourse. Politicians neither had courage, nor desire to challenge it. They feed on it. In effect, path ways of political empowerment effectively handicapped economic and social freedoms. If gay rights were a yard stick of social freedoms, which it is, Communist China decriminalized homosexuality as way back in 1997. Mandarins of Beijing had little to worry about the purists and religious leaders standing on their way. 
India however was special. Amidst the depravity of its swarming masses, the British left behind, and the independent leaders largely left untouched, a set of strong independent institutions, judiciary being perhaps the most activist and standard-setting one of all. It fell regularly upon the courts to upend this skewed status quo, and uphold social justice. 
Indias first petition against the Section 377 was submitted in the 1980s. In 2009, the Delhi High Court decriminalized homosexuality. Religious groups challenged the ruling in the Supreme Court which in 2013 set aside the High Court judgement, and ruled that the decision to decriminalize homosexuality should be a matter of Parliament. Subsequently in 2015, Indias Lok Sabha voted against a private member Bill by Congress MP Sashi Tharoor to decriminalize homosexuality. However, in 2016, Indias Supreme Court decided to review all pleas against the Section 377 and named a five-member bench Constitutional Court, which last week stuck off the book the colonial era law. 
Announcing the ruling, the Chief Justice Dipak Misra observed that the majoritarian view of social morality cannot violate the rights of even one single individual. 
Interestingly, the triumph of Indias long battle for gay rights happened under the Hindu nationalist BJP, of which number of key functionaries are known to be not just bigots, but also homophobes. Chief Justice Misra himself was under a cloud, and was publicly criticized for being overly pro-establishment by a group of fellow Judges, who last year held a rare press conference to warn that the independence of judiciary is under pressure. By striking off one and a half century old unjust law, the Justice might have reclaimed his stature. 
Just like Indias vestige law, Article 365A of Sri Lankas Penal Code prohibits anyone, irrespective of gender, from engaging in gross indecency. Like in India, the law had not actively been enforced, and no conviction has been obtained. However, in both countries, this discriminatory law has provided pretext for rogue cops and bigots to harass LGBTQ people. Similarly, it discourages companies from employing gay people, and creates room for workplace discrimination. Social stigmatization aggravated by discriminatory laws prevents the victims from seeking legal help. 
Sri Lanka has sent mixed signals over the civil societys calls for decriminalizing of homosexuality. In October, 2014, the then Rajapaksa administration assured the United Nations Human Rights Commission that sexual minorities were already protected under existing anti-discrimination laws provided in the Constitution. In November 2016, Sri Lanka voted against a plan to abolish the UN Independent Expert on violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Last year, the government also updated its national human rights plan with a pledge to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. 
However, the political will has been in short supply. Ignorance and politically calculated puritanism have not helped the cause. Last year, the Cabinet of Ministers rebuffed a proposal to decriminalize homosexuality. President Maithripala Sirisena led the charge against the proposal. More liberally inclined ones such as Prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Mangala Samaraweera do not seem to have guts to ride the roughshod. 
All of that leads the progressive folks to pin their hopes on the judiciary. After all,the idea of independent institutions is, as much as upholding checks and balances, is also about being a beacon of reason in societies mired in ignorance. 
The victory of Indian campaign has cleared the path of many hurdles for their Sri Lankan counterparts. Indian Supreme Court ruling should set a judicial precedent that Sri Lankan Judges, who may otherwise shy away due to conservative pressure, would find as helpful. Media exposure to Indian judgment would also generate awareness among public. Also, though gutless to act on its own to decriminalize homosexuality, the current government is unlikely to stand on the way of a progressive ruling by the Supreme Court, like its predecessor could probably have done. As far as the judiciary is concerned, this offers an opportunity to prove that it has come a long way since the gory days of the former regime when the judges, a quite a few of them, were pet poodles of the then first family. 
Sri Lankas LGBTQ activists, civil society and professional organizations should make use of this opening and challenge the archaic discriminatory law in the court. They have a very strong chance of success.

I know the reason for delaying Gin-Nilwala projects: MS
	
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said he knew the reason why the Gin-Nilwala development projects were suppressed and sidelined during the past regime and even the present government.
He said while an inquiry was in progress over the delays that took place during the last regime, an inquiry has to be held over it's non-implementation by the present government.
"I am stopping short of commenting on it further because I know the reasons for the delays and holding back of those projects by the previous regime and this regime. So don't make me to expose them in public and I hope the relevant authorities will treat this as an eye-opener and reminder and work on them immediately protecting their political values," the President told a gathering in Hambantota.
He was addressing a national programme held in the Magam-Ruhunupura International Conference Hall in Hambantota to create awareness among the farmers regarding the development of paddy fields.
He said, The farmers told me about Gin and Nilwala Rivers and they handed over an appeal to me as well. You all are aware of what happened to the project during the past regime. An inquiry is being held separately about it. I think another inquiry has to be done regarding it. I know the delay in implementing it. The cabinet paper regarding this project is delayed for three months and I know the reason for it. (Ariyaratna Ranabahu)

US fears that the highly militarized Pakistan could be the worlds largest nuclear-weapon-State by 2025
	Development of tactical nuclear force is more worrying
	Pakistan could have 220 to 225 nuclear warheads by 2025

Colombo, September 10: Pakistans galloping nuclear weapons programme is worrying not just India, which is its target as the regional rival and adversary, but also its traditional ally and Super Power, the United States.
The American fear is not just that but a politically unstable and highly militarized Pakistan could be the worlds largest nuclear-weapon-State by 2025.
It is the development of a tactical nuclear force to be used in the battlefield, which is more worrying.
Simply put, the American fear is that Pakistani tactical or battlefield nuclear warheads might be stolen by Islamic militant groups and be used against the US.
According to researchers Hans M. Kristensen, Robert S. Norris and Julia Diamond of the American Nuclear Information Project, Pakistan could have 220 to 225 nuclear warheads by 2025 if the present pace of development continues.
In their recent paper entitled Pakistani Nuclear Forces 2018, published in Taylor and Francis online
(https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00963402.2018.1507796 scroll=top&needAccess=true), the authors say that Pakistans nuclear weapons programme has been faster than American projections.
It now has 140 to 150 nuclear warheads, which exceeds the projection made by the US Defense Intelligence Agency in 1999. According to that Pakistan would have only 60 to 80 warheads by 2020.
Below Strategic Level
Hans Kristensen, who is the Director of the American Nuclear Information Project, says that Pakistan is building up a full spectrum deterrent including short-range nuclear-capable weapon systems to counter threats at the battlefield level.
Tactical battlefield nuclear weapons are needed to blunt any Indian attack using its superiority in men and conventional weaponry, Pakistani strategic planners think.
But Kristensen fears that the growing inventory of short-range nuclear weapon systems could lead to problems with warhead management and command and control during a crisis.
The Trump Administrations apprehension goes beyond this to include the possibility of an increase in the likelihood of nuclear exchange in the region.
This is the dreaded nuclear proliferation.
But Pakistani officials insist that the tactical nuclear weapons cannot be stolen.
Samar Mubarik Mund, a former Director of Pakistans National Defense Complex, said in 2013 that a Pakistani nuclear warhead is assembled only at the eleventh hour if [it] needs to be launched. It is stored in three to four different parts at three to four different locations. If a nuclear weapon doesnt need to be launched, then it is never available in assembled form.
Justifying the tactical nuclear weapons programme in 2015, General Khalid Kidwai, a member of Pakistans National Command Authority, said:
Pakistan opted to develop a variety of short-range, low-yield nuclear weapons as a defensive, deterrence response to an offensive doctrine by India.
Pakistan fears that India might launch quick strikes into Pakistan with eight to nine brigades of about 35,000 troops simultaneously. Such an incursion can be stopped only by using tactical battlefield nuclear weapons, Islamabad believes.
Nuclear weapons production complex
Pakistan has a well-established and diverse fissile material production complex that is expanding, Kristensen and his co-authors point out.
It includes the Kahuta uranium enrichment plant east of Islamabad, which appears to be growing with the addition of what could be another enrichment plant, as well as the enrichment plant at Gadwal. Four heavy-water plutonium production reactors appear to have been completed at the Khushab Complex. Three of the reactors at the complex have been added in the past 10 years.
The New Labs Reprocessing Plant at Nilore, which reprocesses spent fuel and extracts plutonium, has been expanded. A second reprocessing plant located at Chashma in the northwestern part of Punjab province may have been completed.
Nuclear-capable missiles and their mobile launchers are developed and produced at the National Defense Complex in the Kala Chitta Dahr mountain range west of Islamabad. Other launcher and missile-related production and maintenance facilities may be located near Tarnawa and Taxila, the researchers say.
It has been suspected for long that the Pakistan Ordnance Factories near Wah, northwest of Islamabad, produce nuclear warheads.
Estimating Stockpile Difficult
Estimating the size of the Pakistani nuclear warhead stockpile is fraught with uncertainty, the authors say.
A frequent mistake is to derive the estimate directly from the amount of weapons-grade fissile material produced. This is theoretically enough to produce between 236 and 283 warheads. But calculating stockpile size based solely on fissile material inventory is an incomplete methodology that tends to produce inflated numbers.
Warhead production capability must take several factors into account, including production facilities, delivery systems and political directions, the authors recommend. According to them, Pakistan lacks enough nuclear-capable launchers to accommodate 200 to 300 warheads.
However, according to NATO, despite its drawbacks, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world. In the researchers estimate, Pakistan currently is producing sufficient fissile material to build 14 to 27 new warheads per year.
Nuclear-capable aircraft
Pakistan has the F-16A/B and Mirage III/V fighter squadrons which can deliver nuclear warheads. It has developed sophisticated computer and electronic technology to outfit the US F-16s with nuclear weapons. The F-16A/Bs have a range of 1,600 km.
Some of the Mirage III and/or Mirage V aircraft have been used in test-launches of the nuclear-capable Raad air-launched cruise missile. The Pakistani Air Force is adding aerial refuelling capability to the Mirage. There are also rumours that Pakistan intends to make the Chinese-supplied JF-17 fighter nuclear-capable, Kristensen says.

Pakistan fears that India might launch quick strikes into Pakistan with eight to nine brigades of about 35,000 troops simultaneously. Such an incursion can be stopped only by using tactical battlefield nuclear weapons, Islamabad believes.
Land-based ballistic missiles
Pakistan has six operational nuclear-capable land-based ballistic missiles. These are the short-range Abdali (Hatf-2), Ghaznavi (Hatf-3), Shaheen-1 (Hatf-4), and NASR (Hatf-9), and the medium-range Ghauri (Hatf-5) and Shaheen-2 (Hatf-6).
Three other nuclear-capable ballistic missiles are under development, namely, the medium-range Shaheen-1A, Shaheen-3, and the MIRVed Ababeel. Pakistan has eight or nine road-mobile ballistic missile garrisons including four or five along the Indian border.
Controversial NASR
One of the most controversial new nuclear-capable missiles in the Pakistani arsenal is the NASR (Hatf-9), a short-range, solid-fuel missile originally with a range of only 60 km that has recently been extended to 70 km, Kristensen and his colleagues say.
According to the Pakistani government, the NASR carries nuclear warheads of appropriate yield with high accuracy, shoot and scoot attributes and was developed as a quick response system.
With a range too short to attack strategic targets inside India, NASR appears intended solely for battlefield use against invading Indian troops, Kristensen avers.
Pakistan conducted two test launches of the medium-range Shaheen-3 in 2015 with a range of 2,750 km sufficient to target all of mainland India including the Andaman Islands which, according to Gen. Kidwai, could be a major military base.
On 24 January 2017, Pakistan test launched a new medium-range ballistic missile  Ababeel  that the government says is capable of carrying multiple warheads, using Multiple Independent Reentry Vehicle (MIRV) technology.
Ground- and air-launched cruise missiles
Pakistan continues to develop the ground-launched Babur (Hatf-7) and the air-launched Raad (Hatf-8) nuclear-capable cruise missiles. Babur and Raad both have stealth capabilities and pinpoint accuracy, and a low-altitude, terrain-hugging missile with high maneuverability.
The air-launched, dual-capable Raad (Hatf-8) can deliver nuclear and conventional warheads with great accuracy to a range of 350 km, the government claims.
Sea-launched cruise missiles
Pakistan is also developing a sea-launched version of the Babur known as Babur-3. The weapon has been test-launched twice, in January 2017 and March 2018.
The Indians, however, claim that the Pakistani missile programme is based on foreign designs. The Shaheen and Ababeel series are of Chinese origin; Ghauri I and II are of North Korean origin, and the Babur Cruise Missile is Ukrainian according to Indian Defense News of May 27, 2017.

A certain political leader who joined the recent Janabalaya Kolombata protest march at the Pettah Bogaha junction walked only a short distance when he became so exhausted, he collapsed into a sitting position on the road.

Panting heavily, the politico remained virtually lying on the road for about one hour, a few yards short of the Lake House roundabout where the protesters were to converge. He looked around for his security guards for support to get back on feet, but they had got lost in the milling crowd.
Meanwhile, some marchers were seen taking selfies with the helplessly lying politico. However, one of them had the presence of mind to fan him with a folded poster while another offered him water from the bottle he was carrying.
The politico had later risen to his feet with the support of a security guard who had turned up after some time and staggered his way to the Lake House roundabout with his help, they say.

POLITICAL CIRCUS HITS TOWN Leaders in suites, drunken supporters fallen on streets
	


Thousands want to see there is quick action to punish the corrupt
	This was an election promise that has to be kept at all costs, whatever the circumstances may be

It was a circus all right, acrobats, jugglers and jumpers galore, while mothers were afraid to send their children to school, workers stayed away from their workplaces, some offices closed early. The organisers of the protest were unconcerned about the loss to children of education, loss to the economy by offices being closed.
Their only focus was on themselves and getting back to the grandeur of power. Far from bringing the government down, many JO supporters were seen fallen in drunken stupors, lying on streets, some rescued by the ambulances introduced with the help of India by this government and hospitalized. One man died later of a heart attack. It was good to see few women among the supporters transported to Colombo who was gifted with packets of Chicken Biriyani, packets of cigarettes and arrack.
It showed that the female of the species is wiser and far harder to fool than the male!
Their promise to bring 200,000 supporters was just their usual boastful talk, they could only muster about 20,000 supporters.
Namal Rajapaksa and Dilan Perera have never been famed as mental heavyweights, so their ridiculous statements after the circus was over, far ahead of the break of dawn, should not be taken seriously. The tax authorities should question the sourcing of the funds used for this and where they came from.
One wonders why there were no verbal attacks on this charade of a protest and the inconvenience caused to the public, by those three prosperous, well-fed businessmen, robber barons as they were named in the media, who vented their wrath and fury against the Government, in no uncertain terms at a fireside chat recently.

Namal Rajapaksa and Dilan Perera have never been famed as mental heavyweights, so their ridiculous statements after the circus was over, far ahead of the break of dawn, should not be taken seriously. The tax authorities should question the sourcing of the funds used for this and where they came from
One of them openly called for a dictatorship. His benefits from dictators earlier on are no secret. Do they condone the white vans, abductions, murders and the rampant unprecedented level of corruption in the Rajapaksa regime
Another bemoaned the fact that government servants were given an increase in salaries while businessmen were taxed to the hilt.
Still, another spoke about takeovers which had been done by the previous government but gave the impression that it was the fault of the present one.
Perhaps age has dimmed his brain. It seems a pity that their wisdom hasnt increased along with their bank balances. There are none so blind that those who will not see! I must commend the comments by Dhammika Perera and Merrill J Fernando in this context. I would like to know from the first three I mentioned whether they would have dared to hurl these attacks at the time the Rajapaksa family were ruling the country. I dread to think of what their fate would have been.
They are going far beyond the peripheries of freedom, now in existence and abusing it like some in the media do too.
The previous government did not focus on education; perhaps as many of them are uneducated, they value brawn more than the development of the brain. This government has increased the Mahapola allowance to Rs 4,000/-, given laptops to schoolchildren, built new buildings for 9,000 schools all over the country, given insurance to schoolchildren.
So much investment has been to ensure an educated future generation which can take the country forward with the desired intellectual ability to do so. There have been over 137 housing projects launched under the leadership of Sajith Premadasa by this government.
The fact that the government allowed the protest is again, a tribute to the freedom and democracy that exists today. This in sharp contrast to the protest during the Rajapaksa regime at Rathupaswala, in which several protestors were killed.
The citizens of Colombo followed the lead of the government led by the President and the Prime Minister in ignoring the protest, no cheering squads form Colombo lined the roads.
Lands are continuing to be returned to rightful owners in the North and in the South too, this is being done to those who lost theirs through the injustice of one kind or another.

The fact that the government allowed the protest is again, a tribute to the freedom and democracy that exists today. This in sharp contrast to the protest during the Rajapaksa regime at Rathupaswala, in which several protestors were killed
There has been a vast creation of employment, prices of medicines reduced, salaries increased. The percentage of those affected by dengue in Colombo has dropped by 64% in comparison with 2017. There is no vulgar extravagance in public spending. No VIP of the government has used public funds for memorials for their families. VIPs wives and sons do not fly to NEliya for baths or to ride their horses.
To my mind, what thousands of others including me want to see, is that there is quick action to punish the corrupt in the former regimeand in this too if they are guilty of corruption.
That is my grouse. Slow action in that respect. This was an election promise that has to be kept at all costs, whatever the circumstances may be.

We also have Nihal of CJC fame jumping in like a Bull in a China Shop to give his professorial bill a hand, in stating that there was no impediment in the pseudo-Emperor contesting the Presidency again.
The latter has unfortunately not changed his clothes, literally or metaphorically and Nihal may find that visions of CJC become more than a blast from the past in the minds of the people.
Political Leaders must act like Statesman with dignity and fortitude through all seasons, ..meet with both triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same.
The Prime Minister has been the epitome of this throughout his political life, a worthy example to the second string of young leaders he has groomed in the UNP.

Poor economic management causes fuel price increase: Bandula
	
The Government had to increase the prices of fuel due to its poor economic management, MP Bandula Gunawardana said today.
Addressing a news briefing, he said the incumbent Government did not have a long term economic policy in place.
There is a prevailing economic crisis caused due to the rupee depreciation, Dr. Bandula said.
The Government has been unable to provide the advantage to the people in such a situation where the World Market price of fuel remains in a lower percentage than that in the precious regime, Dr. Bandula said.
Although the World Market price remained in a higher percentage in our Government, we were able to keep the people unburdened. That is why I reiterate that this Government lacks a proper economic management, he added.
Meanwhile, MP Sisira Jayakody said even though Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was boasting of the growth of the economy, they could not see any such growth.
The economic growth rate is diminishing compared to that in the previous Government. We were able to maintain a growth rate of six but now it has declined even below three, MP Jayakody said.
He further said that Enterprise Sri Lanka would not become a helping hand for the poor but would make rich people richer.(Sheain Fernandopulle)

Record and send audio or video clips to stop bribery and corruption: Ajith Rohana
	
Traffic Police DIG Ajith Rohana requested the public not to hesitate to record and send audio or video clips taken from mobile phones on incidents involving activities of traffic police officers who seek bribe or other favours.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror he said several complaints had been received by the Police Department regarding bribe and corruption charges involving traffic police officers.
It is true that a few police officers are engaged in such activities and the Department is blamed, he said.
However, the Department needs to wipe out such malpractices by traffic police officers.
He also said people have every right to get a video or an audio recording of traffic police officers involved in illegal activities on the road.
"Don't be hesitant to record what they do. If you are in the middle of a discussion with an officer and you can't video record the conversation, at least leave the audio record on," he said.
With the help of such video and audio evidence, it could be used to prevent such misbehaviours of the traffic police officers on duty and would help us to take legal actions based on that.
He said, with this request the police department hopes to provide the best service while preventing illegal activities of the police officers.
I understand that there are many people who travel without mobile phones and digital devices. So, digital evidence is not always required to initiate action against errant officers. Even if a citizen lodges a normal complaint, we can proceed with the action. But, the public must make use of technology whenever it's available. It makes to conduct police operations easier," DIG Rohana said.
DIG Ajith Rohana also requested the people to send their evidence either audio or video clips via email to dig.traffic@police.lk
It is what people should keep in mind taking and giving bribes is a punishable offence under the Sri Lankan Act. And keep in mind to not to give bribes to police officers after doing anything illegal.
He also said that the traffic police officers can also record such activities and emailed them to the above email address.
It is obvious that objections would be raised when a person attempts to get a recording from their mobile phone. In such a situation, any other person along with them can take the opportunity. Taking a video or audio recording is not an offence.
If a person feels that the police officer may have a chance to request a bribe while giving the charge sheet, he or she can switch on the audio recording in his mobile phones. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Remand order on Johnston: K'gala HC legally wrong - Romesh de Silva PC
	
Filing a revision application in the Court of Appeal, President's Counsel Romesh de Silva today said the order given by the Kurunegala High Court Judge remanding former Minister Johnston Fernando pending the conclusion of the trial was legally wrong.
President's Counsel was of the view that the alleged High Court order was wrong on the face of it as the same court had previously enlarged Mr. Johnston Fernando (accused -petitioner) twice before and after the indictments.
According to the President's Counsel, initially, the prosecution had filed a B report against three suspects namely Johnston Fernando, Mohammed Shakeer and Nalin Fernando over an alleged purchase of certain goods from Laksathosa Limited violating the Public Property Act in Kurunegala Magistrate's Court.
However, later the Kurunegala Magistrate's Court refused to grant bail as the law requires bail to be granted by a high court judge, unless for exceptional circumstances.
Then the suspects filed a revision bail application and were released on conditional bail.
Subsequently, the Attorney General indicted the suspects in High Court.
Mr. De Silva said that his client had pleaded not guilty for the charges and subsequently on the same date he was released on bail again by the same High Court without any objection of the State.
"The Kurunegala High Court Judge was then transfered and the case was taken up before a new Judge. When the trial was finally fixed to be heard daily, the new Judge ordered the suspect to be remanded till the conclusion of the trial proceedings, even though there was no request a to do so,"said Mr. De Silva.
According to the President's Counsel, while remanding the suspect the Kurunegala Judge had said that it was the practice of the Court to do so. "Surely that cannot be the law which violates the Bail Act. What we have to understand is that bail is the rule, remand is the exception" Mr. De Silva said.
The petitioner has sought to issue notices to the respondent of the petition, to set aside the Kurunegala High Court order remanding him, pending the conclusion of the ongoing trial, and to make an interim order releasing him on bail.
The matter was taken up for inquiry before the Bench comprising Judge Achala Wengappully and Judge Janak de Silva.
Subsequently, the application was fixed for support tomorrow 1.30 p.m. by the Court of Appeal. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene yesterday condemned the false and baseless statements made by some elements with ulterior political motives with regard to the national security.
Addressing a meeting in Biyagama Minister Wijewardene said, this group of people had been engaged in a futile attempt of spreading such false statements regarding national security since the political change that took place in January 2015.
He stressed that the government always took decisions after analyzing matters relating to security, giving utmost priority to national security.
He added that a group of power-hungry politicians have been instilling fear and suspicion in the minds of people that the country's security was at risk.
"I must stress that under the advice of President Maithripala Sirisena, the guidance of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and all security chiefs of security, arrangements are being made to strengthen security at all times," he said. (Indika Ramanayaka)

Shilpa Abhimani-2018 offers help in Carving out careers in handicraft
	
Sri Lanka claims of having a proud heritage in terms of arts and crafts. This unique culture has helped Sri Lanka earn recognition in the world. Making of crafts has been an ancient art form and is applied to all most all spheres in the daily lives of people. There is an immense demand for these crafts from other countries. When one considers the individuals who are occupied with making artwork, it is evident that they are mostly destitute people from rural areas. They hardly receive acknowledgment nor are they felicitated for their special skills and artwork. Perhaps they lack the latest facilities to engage in their creations. 
However, there is good news for this industry that is coming in the form of ShilpaAbhimani-2018 Presidential Handicraft Award Ceremony which is scheduled to be launched on September 11 (tomorrow) at the BMICH.The event is jointly organised by the Ministry of Industry & Commerce and National Crafts Council (NCC) and is expected to provide encouragement to these craftsmen and help them pursue their profession.The event will be held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena and Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen. The exhibition will conclude on September 16 (Sunday).
National Crafts Council (NCC)
The NCC is an institution which coordinates matters relating to crafts. The NCC was established by the Parliamentary Act No. 35 of 1982. Its ideals were promotion, development, fostering and preservation of handicrafts and the upliftment of the social and economic status of craftspersons. 
The mission of the NCC is preservation, development, encouragement and promotion of local handicrafts with a traditional and cultural value and the enhancement of economic and social status of craftsmen. 
During the past few decades, the NCC has initiated a host of various projects and programmes to preserve and develop handicrafts and ensure the future of handicrafts. 
ShilpaAbhimani-2018
Shilpa Abhimani-2018 Presidential Handicrafts Competition and Exhibition is the biggest event for handicrafts in Sri Lanka. This is an exhibition which helps value the creativity of the islands craftsmen. 
The NCC has hosted contemporary and innovative projects to felicitate the craftsmen by preserving and developing the handicrafts sector in Sri Lanka. 
The Shilpa Abhimani National Handicrafts Exhibition is a celebration of handicrafts heritage and is held annually. The exhibits capture the hearts and minds of visitors and keeps the venue alive. Demonstrating their crafts are done through workshops, marketing their designs and interactive buyer seller meetings are added features of the event. 
The crafts categories are clay, leaves & grass, Dumbara designs, cane and bamboo, metal, jewellery related crafts, masks and puppets, carved masks, musical instruments, textiles and textile based batik and lace, lacquer works and parasols (Sesath), wood based crafts, leather crafts, stone based crafts, traditional paintings and sculptures, coconut/ kitul/ talipot/ palmyra related miscellaneous crafts and souvenirs. 
Purpose of ShilpaAbhimani
Speaking to the , NCC Chairperson Heshani Bogollagama said that the NCC had begun organising programmes with the intention of honing the skills of nearly 26,000 craftsmen in the country who are registered under the NCC. 
Conducting this type of training, providing them with rare raw materials, giving them equipment necessary for their crafts and marketing facilitation are done through these programmes, she explained. 
She said that the purpose of organising Shilpa Abhimani-2018 was to motivate the local craftsmen and give value to their creations. She added that this is the only exhibition which provides opportunities for craftsmen, who are spread across the country, to show their talents and be felicitated. 
During this National Handicrafts Exhibition, exhibits from 54 fields of handicraft classified under 20 basic sections will be on display. Gold Awards are presented for exhibits falling under the traditional and modern segments that preserve tradition. In addition financial awards and certificates will be given to craftsmen. 
The NCC Chairperson said that since some issues existed in the fields of Arts and Crafts and the marketing industry in Sri Lanka, the exhibition would offer and opportunity for the local craftsmen to directly present their products for the customers. 
110 stalls have been put up for the craftsmen to exhibit their products like silver jewellery, wooden masks, batik, coir products, intricate lace-work, wood carving, lacquer work, musical instruments and ceramics.

It is noteworthy to mention that Sri Lanka Exports Development Board would conduct educational programmes on behalf of the local craftsmen to help them find the ways and means to export their products, capture international market and develop the economy of the country. It is fitting to admire the initiative of NCC and the Ministry of Industry & Commerce to take steps to uplift the local craftsmen, who are isolated in the society. This would provide them with the facility to master their products and enter the international arena of crafts.

SL asylum seekers 'forcibly' deported from Australia
	
At least a dozen Sri Lankan asylum seekers have been forcibly deported back to Sri Lanka, having been put on a specially chartered jet that left Perth on Tuesday, the Guardian Australia reported.
Some of the men deported had been in detention for more than six years in Australia, while others still had challenges before Australian courts pending. The majority were Tamil, but at least one was Sinhalese.
Guardian Australia has been provided with details of some of those returned but has chosen not to name them out of concern for their safety. Several had reported to Australian authorities they had previously been abducted and tortured by security forces in Sri Lanka.
The asylum seekers were transported from detention centres across Australia and taken to Perth, from where they were flown out on a charter flight run by Skytraders. The flight left at 1.57am.
The group landed in Colombo on Tuesday but has not made contact with family or legal representatives. Returned asylum seekers are, without previous exception, interviewed, arrested and charged by Sri Lanka police on arrival.
Human rights groups and legal advocates have serious concerns over the safety of returned asylum seekers.
The United Nations rapporteur on countering terrorism wrote in a report in July that Sri Lankas progress towards peace had virtually ground to a halt, and that he heard evidence of very brutal and cruel methods of torture, including beatings with sticks, the use of stress positions, asphyxiation using plastic bags drenched in kerosene, pulling out of fingernails.
With airlines under pressure globally over their role in forced deportations, the Australian government is increasingly using charter flights to deport asylum seekers it has judged not to meet its protection obligations.
The Department of Home Affairs recently awarded Skytrader a three-year $63m tender, to begin in December, providing a dedicated airframe to meet operational demands for the movement of high-risk persons and departmental staff between on-shore and offshore locations.
The tender, to follow on from an existing $144m contract, stresses the variable, discreet and confidential nature of ABFs operations and says the department needs to take long-range, multisector flights with limited notice.
The issue of corporate cooperation in forced removals came to renewed international attention last month when Swedish student Elin Ersson refused to sit down on a plane at Gothenburg airport, protesting that an Afghan man was being deported to hell. She succeeded, and the man was removed from the plane.
Similar protests have been staged in Australia, resulting, in some cases, in criminal charges laid against protesters.
The Australian government does not comment on the specific cases but has consistently defended its removal processes, saying it adheres strictly to international law.
Australia does not remove people to Sri Lanka who engage Australias non-refoulement obligations, a spokesperson said. Australia takes its non-refoulement obligations seriously.

SL needs broad HR impact assessments: UN Expert
	
Sri Lanka should implement a robust legal framework to conduct comprehensive human rights impact assessments prior to carrying out large scale infrastructure projects such as the Sampur power plant and the Hambantota port, a visiting UN Expert today said.
Juan Pablo Bohoslavsky, the UN Independent Expert on the Effects of Foreign Debt on Human Rights expressed these views at a news briefing held at the end of his nine-day visit to Sri Lanka.
After the end of war in 2009, he said large-scale infrastructure projects have flourished throughout the country.
Examples include the Colombo Outer Circular Expressway, Sampur power plant, the Hambantota port and Hambantota airport, all projects having been approved and launched in the late 2000s and early2010s. However, the Sri Lankan legal framework does not establish the obligation to conduct a comprehensive human rights impact assessment of such infrastructure projects before they are started. So, I advise the Government to pass robust and comprehensive laws on the issues based on existing international human rights standards, Mr. Bohoslavsky said.
He said the Sri Lankan Government should undertake an assessment of the human rights impact of its economic reform policies, apart from infrastructure projects.
Commenting on corruption, illicit financial flows and human rights, Mr.Bohoslavsky commended the Government for establishing a special court to handle cases specifically related to bribery and corruption in order to speed up cases that have dragged on sometimes for years.
It is equally important to ensure that their members are appointed on a meritocratic basis, enjoy stability and are independent during their entire tenure, and that the courts are financially autonomous and not subject to political pressure or interference, he said.
He said illicit financial flows cover a broad range of phenomena including tax evasion, money laundering and corruption.
The negative impact of such flows on human rights, he said can be translated in a number of ways, the erosion of public finance and available resources being the one with the broadest impacts on human rights.
In order to assess those impacts and design and implement adequate policies, estimations of illicit flows are needed. Yet, I learned that no study or official estimation of illicit outflows or inflows has been conducted to date in Sri Lanka. I urge the Government to conduct these studies in order to further curb illicit financial flows in line with the Sustainable Development Goals, he said.
He said banks in Sri Lanka have the duty to report suspicious transactions to the pertinent authorities based on the principle know your client.
However, because tax evasion is not considered a predicate offense in the country, banks have no duty to report suspicious transactions that could involve tax evasion of their clients. I urge the Government to close this legal gap and request help from the banks to improve tax collection, he said.
Meanwhile, he advised the Government to support the Constitution reform process in order to ensure inclusion of all economic, social and cultural rights in the national legal system, including their justiciability.
"Economic and social rights should be incorporated explicitly in the Constitution. Sri Lanka has ratified the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural rights in 1980. It is an obligation of the State of Sri Lanka explicitly to acknowledge and recognize social and economic rights of its citizens. I also recommend courts to take into account the human rights international legal obligations of Sri Lanka when taking decisions on economic and social rights in the country, he said.
He also commented on the women, who are in the rural areas and affected by war, who had borrowed large number of loans and said they were specially targeted by micro finance lenders.
Those institutions charge up to 220 percent interest rates for their loans and apply compound interest. The mechanism has been designed to make huge profits for the lenders and put a very heavy burden on the shoulders of the largely poor female borrowers. I urge the Government to establish an interest rate cap for these institutions and also to pass and implement robust and strict regulation, the expert stressed. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: Success of Emirates and failure of Sri Lankan

Success of Emirates and failure of Sri Lankan
	

Around early 1985, when I was working with Dubai based English Language Daily Khaleej Times, speculation was rife that the Dubai Government was planning to start an international airline. 
Many dismissed the success of such a venture. However some said it would turn out to be a success story. I made queries about the venture from Mr. Maurice Flanagan, the then Manager of Dubai National Air Travel Agency, who later became the founder and General Manager of Emirates Airline. 
He confirmed the story and on 25 March 1985 Emirates Airline was launched with its inaugural flight to Lahore with Pakistan International Airlines providing two of the airlines first aircraft on wet-lease. 
With $10 million in start-up capital it was required to operate independently of Government subsidy. Pakistan International Airlines provided training facilities to the Emirates cabin crew at its academy. 
Today this is the largest airline in the Middle East, operating over 3,600 flights per week from its hub at Dubai International Airport, to more than 140 cities in 81 countries. From March 2016 to February 2017 Emirates had the longest non-stop commercial flight from Dubai to Auckland. 
Emirates operates a mixed fleet of Airbus and Boeing wide-body aircraft and is one of the few airlines to operate an all-wide-body aircraft fleet (while excluding Emirates Executive). As of November 2017, Emirates is the largest Airbus A380 operator with 103 aircraft in service and a further 42 on order. Since its introduction, the Airbus A380 has become an integral part of the Emirates fleet. 
When emirates airlines was launched, SriLankan airlines, then Air Lanka, made a remarkable headway as one of the most successful third world airlines. Air Lanka was established as the flag carrier of Sri Lanka once the Government of Sri Lanka shut down the bankrupt Air Ceylon. 
In 1998, the then administration of former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, sold 40 percent of the equity of SriLankan, worth US $ 70 million, and later increased it to 43.6%, and gave management rights to Emirates after it suffered years of losses. 
However Emirates exited the airline after 2008 and sold their shares to the Government. SriLankan Airlines, which made a profit of 4.4 billion rupees in 2008, the year in which the management agreement with Emirates Airlines ended, has lost 107 billion rupees since then. 
Highlighting the precarious situation of Sri Lankan airlines, Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne said on 24 March 2016, that the state-run SriLankan Airlines was made to suffer colossal losses because fromer President Mahinda Rajapaksa forced out Emirates Airlines. The national carrier then entered into a questionable aircraft deal, which amounted to a national financial crime. 
The Rajapaksa administration had cancelled the visa of then Chief Executive Peter Hill because he did knock off enough paying passengers to accommodate a large entourage of Rajapaksa loyalists in a single aircraft, he said. 
Cancellation of visa
The CEO had said We should not offload all these passengers since they are citizens and they are paying passengers with a contract, Wickramaratne told Parliament. 
The next day his visa was cancelled and the year was 2007. 
By 2015 there were accumulated losses of 128 billion rupees, debt of 76 billion rupees (542 million dollars) and a hole in its balance sheet of 74 billion rupees. The hole in the balance sheet would have been bigger if not for capital injections by the Treasury which came in the form of taxes collected from the people. 
Sri Lankan Airlines had been given 100 million US dollars each year to cover losses by the Treasury. SriLankans management had then decided to buy A330 and A350 aircraft in a reckless manner, he charged. 
He said according to documents 780 million US dollars in Government support was needed in the three years after its acquisition. An 80 million dollar deposit had been paid. 
Terms more expensive
Aviation experts have told us that the lease contract terms are 25 percent more expensive than normal and it needs to be looked into. The present value of the lease liability over the next 12 years is 1.5 billion US dollars. 
This is a financial crime. We have to investigate this. 
Meanwhile, according to the Daily Mirror of 7th September 2018, Minister Champika Ranawaka had disclosed that Sri Lankan had recorded a profit of Rs 80 billion when it was taken over by the Government from the Emirates Airlines. Then after, the Government established Mihin Air, as a regional air service to Sri Lanka, the two airlines have amassed a loss of Rs 200 billion and became a liability to the Treasury. Every Sri Lankan pays Rs 10,000 per year to cover the cost of the two airlines which has become a curse to the country, the minister added. 
Now the question is who is responsible for this disaster
It was the time when Dubai was unknown and unheard of. The population in this country was only a few thousands the country suffered from extreme poverty and illiteracy. There was no school, hospital, electricity nor drinking water. Turning to stormy seas for fishing and trade remained their only means of survival. 
When the opportunity for development came in the wake of oil wealth, the rulers and the people alike grabbed it with both hands.

The islands successive Governments, both the United National Party and the Sri Lankan Freedom Party, which ruled and still rule this country are fully responsible for this mismanagement of the airline. 
For example SriLankan has been accused in the recent past of corruption, and the former Chairman Nishantha Wickramasinghe is alleged to have had affairs with air hostesses. Wickramasinghe, has been accused of lacking the experience needed for the job nor possessed the formal educational qualifications that were needed of him to be the head of an airline. 

In 1998, the then administration of former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, sold 40 percent of the equity of SriLankan, worth US $ 70 million, and later increased it to 43.6%, and gave management rights to Emirates after it suffered years of losses
In October 2015, the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) attempted to summon Wickramasinghe to inquire about various irregularities in the Airline. However, they were unable to locate him, and his wife claimed he had not returned home in three years and that she was unaware of his whereabouts. Later he notified the PRECIFAC that he was abroad and was unavailable. This is the ridiculous state of affairs in the country where politicians protect each other and their close associates. 
This negative development regarding SriLankan exists despite the fact that its been three years since the Unity Government was voted into power.
Caption-It is worthy to reflect on why SriLankan is trapped in a financial quagmire while Emirates which started operations much later flies high.

Trying to get 20A enacted  as new Constitution is unlikely now  - Vijitha Herath
	
There is better democratic ambience now
	RTI, 19A, OMP are positive steps
	But, corruption and frauds continue unabated
	JVP and National Movement for Social Justice are now together
	it is easier to secure presidency through offering cash inducements today

Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Vijitha Herath who presented the 20th Amendment to the Constitution speaks about it and his partys future political agenda.
The excerpts:
Q You have presented the 20th Amendment. The governments support is crucial to ensure its passage through Parliament. How certain are you of getting it
We have received positive responses from individual MPs of different parties. There is no official confirmation of support by their respective parties. We need the support of both, the government and the opposition to enact it. We intend to hold official talks with all the parties in this regard. The government is yet to take up a position in this case. It all depends on political developments in the country.

We believe the UNP will also support our move. It stood for it at the 2015 elections. The UNP also passed a resolution to this effect at its previous convention. Again, there is a proposal before Constitutional Assembly to abolish this
Q According to you political understanding, what do you assume as the governments stance
Of course, the government comprises of two main forces - the UNP and the SLFP. There is no way for President Maithripala Sirisena to oppose this. He promised to scrap executive presidency. We believe he will extend his support. The UNP has taken a policy decision to abolish it though they are the ones who introduced it in 1978. On that basis, we believe the UNP will also support our move. It stood for it at the 2015 elections. The UNP also passed a resolution to this effect at its previous convention. Again, there is a proposal before Constitutional Assembly to abolish this.
QThe government is to present its draft of the new Constitution soon. Despite that, what is the reason for your party to undertake this task to amend the Constitution
The governments move is a long term project. As things strand at the moment, it is unlikely to become a reality even. As for the Constitution being drafted by the government at the moment, it is expected to deal with not only executive presidency but also other aspects such as human rights, the national question etc. It is subjected to debate. As for abolition of executive presidency, it is something acceptable to almost all. At least, we try to get the executive presidency abolished in the event that a totally new Constitution is unlikely under the current political circumstances.

Q Yet, there is an allegation that the JVP is carrying out a political project in the interests of the UNP in the government. What is your response
The JVP does not work according to the dictates of any party. We have been opposed to executive presidency right from its inception in 1978. We have taken action against it in numerous ways- protest campaigns, strategies worked out at presidential elections etc.On the other hand, in the event of abolition of executive presidency, it will be more advantageous to Mahinda Rajapaksa than to the UNP. Now, Mr. Rajapaksa cannot seek presidency for the third time. In case the 20th Amendment is enacted, he get the chance to become the Prime Minister with more powers. 
QActually, your party campaigned for the abolition of executive presidency. But, this is an exercise not to scrap it totally but to prune its power further only. Alongside, the criterion for the election of President is proposed to be changed. Why did you decide to keep presidency with reduced power rather than abolishing it in its entirety
We would love to abolish executive presidency as a whole. For it, a new Constitution has to be introduced. Now, we are trying to bring an amendment to the existing Constitution. There will be a presidency. Yet, it is not executive presidency. The appointment of Ministers, Ministry Secretaries, and their removal from office are the sole discretion of the President today. Under the proposed presidency, all these powers will be taken away to be vested with Parliament. In that sense, the Presidents power will be reduced drastically. He will only have the sole discretion in exercising his power over the provincial councils. In case any provincial council declares independence, the President can dissolve it. We will not intend to take that power away from the President. 
Q The President is supposed to be elected by a simple majority of Parliament under the 20th Amendment. Then, the person elected as the President will be duty bound to carry out the policies of his party. So, that party can manoeuvre the President finally according to its whims and fancies. What is your view
We have safeguards for it. The person who intends to be the President should obtain a simple majority in Parliament. It is difficult for a single party to get the simple majority or 113 seats in todays Parliament. Then, the party is compelled to get the support of the Opposition. Then, it is compelled to field someone who can get the support from across the political divide of the House. 
Secondly, the person elected as the President should relinquish all his party affiliations including membership. President Sirisena contested as the common candidate. Later, he took over the leadership of SLFP. If the 20th Amendment is enacted, it will be impossible.

 Q As you said, no party has the simple majority in the present Parliament. But, there is a possibility of one party getting more than a simple majority at future elections. Then, that party will get the chance to elect the President single-handedly rather than making a bilateral approach. What is your view
That may be possible. But, the President to be elected has no too much of power concentrated in his hands. He is no longer the Head of State. He is not even a member of the Cabinet. He can exercise some power over the provincial councils in this case. He can appoint the provincial governors or dissolve provincial councils if they declare independence from the central government. 
Q In our political culture, it is an open secret that the MPs can be lured through the offer of cash inducements. Though it is not proven as such, it has become an open secret. Then, there is possibility of money being disposed to win over the MPs to elect the President. How do you intend addressing this concern
Actually, it is easier to secure presidency through offering cash inducements today. When a Chinese company offered a multi- million cash inducement to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, it amounted to the virtual acquisition of the entire country. The President, proposed under our system, has no such power to handle the economic affairs of the country. What is the use of winning over such a President with a little power Only if the President is all powerful, it is worth in that sense to dispose money to install someone handpicked as the President. 
Q You cannot belittle proposed presidency in that manner. It is a post worth enough in terms of prestige and dignity. It is something more than a ceremonial presidency. What is your view
There is nothing much for the President to do. In India, Abdul Kalam served his presidency as a dignified person respected by all across the political divide. 
Q Even in India, the consent of Lok Sabha MPs alone does not suffice to elect the President. You have simplified the criterion for the election of President here even more than in India. Why is it
In India, there are both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. We have only one. The President, under the proposed system, will have no power to control the Finance Ministry at all. He cannot hold ministerial posts. It is a transitional system. It is no longer the executive presidency. Alongside, it is not ceremonial presidency either. It is something in-between. 

When we rule the country, this is not the type of constitution we adopt. Under a JVP government, we will have our own way of appointing the President. This is not a JVP govt. These are just reforms to the existing system
Q In the countries with communist systems, governance is centrally controlled. Your party stands for a communist system. Yet, in this case, you seem to be having a departure from central control of governance. Why is it
You are talking about a constitution under a communist system. When we rule the country, this is not the type of constitution we adopt. Under a JVP government, we will have our own way of appointing the President. This is not a JVP government. These are just reforms to the existing system. We will have a clear departure from the present system under a communist system under our rule. In countries like China, there is central control. But, power is delegated to the bottom level. There is consultation with the bottom level. There is no arbitrary concentration of power at the centre. We believe in democratic centralization of power. That can be achieved under a JVP administration only. 
QWhat is the support you get from the Tamil National Alliance (TNA)for this
The TNA has made comments in support of our stand to abolish executive presidency. The partys position is yet to be communicated to us. 
QAt the last Presidential Election, you asked people to reject the Rajapaksa administration. Also, you said you could not vouch for the quality of the incoming administration. The new government has been in power for three years now. What is your view on their performance in the overall context
We said we could not guarantee the quality of this administration. What the JVP foresaw was exactly correct. It is proven before three years. 
Q How do you compare and contrast the two governments
There are certain changes which we recognize. We do not see everything from a negative perspective. There are some positive reforms as far as democracy is concerned. The 19th Amendment and the Right to Information Act are some of them. The establishment of the Office of Missing Persons is also a positive step. Disappearance of a person is a criminal offence now. People have a better democratic ambience now than then. But, corruption and frauds continue unabated. There is no improvement in the economic front.

QWhat is the alternative from the JVPs perspective
JVP is the alternative! 
QThe National Movement for Social Justice which is now spearheaded by Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya holds some views similar to those of the JVP. Prof. Wijesuriya said both the President and the Prime Minister could no longer be trusted. He said his organization was giving mind to a new political leadership. Is the JVP going to ally with his organization to become one entity
Of course, it has already happened. Already, the National Professionals Organization has been formed. 
Q Does it mean that the organization formed and headed by late Ven. Maduluwave Sobhitha Thera is now with the JVP under one umbrella...
It is like this; There is no formal agreement between us and that organization. But, those intellectuals are convinced that the present system is not the way out.

## Title: Two days and one night in Kurunegala

Two days and one night in Kurunegala
	
Over two days, we tried to traverse the length and breadth of Kurunegala. We could not, even after covering more than 600 kilometres. Then again, it is impossible to ascertain with just one trip, and a randomly organised trip at that, the full worth of a place, especially one as culturally fertile as this. For while much of the region is arid and susceptible to the shifts of droughts and floods, it remains fertile in the memory of the people who inhabit it. Fertile even to those who chance across it and fertile even to those who choose to ignore it. 
We are hesitant to associate a people with the place they reside in, because we happen to be lotus-eaters. What possibly can we know of a region that has housed an entire civilisation, and has borne witness to a renaissance not just in our history, but in our literature and economy as well Precious little, as it turns out.

I have always felt that travel bloggers, in their quest to capture the exotic, frequent those sites which have already been covered, hundreds if not thousands of times, by other bloggers. I remember once making the mistake of boarding myself at the Rest House in Matara. A friend of mine, a close friend, later advised me to go inland, to Deniyaya, Telijjawila, and Akuressa, for it is there, in those places, that the real Matara unveils itself to the outsider. You do not come across many rest houses in Deniyaya and Telijjawila and Akuressa. You come across houses. And real human beings. That curious anomaly called tourism has not visited these places. At least, not yet. The same can be said of Kurunegala, at least the Kurunegala I chose to visit. 
For a long time, Kurunegala to me was a place occupied with history. It was a fortress, a never ending assortment of rocks and mountains which provided the perfect cover for a civilisation that was facing the first few onslaughts of destructive colonialism. The Dambadeniya Era was one of tentative ties with the outside world and careful diplomacy, in particular because the country had been all but completely enslaved. It marked the last recorded time that a kingdom, which had been abandoned before, was resorted to again: Polonnaruwa, under Parakramabahu III. But as Professor K. M. de Silva argues, this was less an accomplishment than a necessity, since Polonnaruwa provided the base for Parakramabahu to maintain cordial relations with the Pandyans and to bring back the sacred tooth relic to Sri Lanka. From Parakramabahu III, the mantle of power passed to Dambadeniya once again. This time, to Kurunegala. 
Fascinating culture
It was this history and the culture it entailed that first fascinated me, I distinctly remember. The shift from Anuradhapura to Polonnaruwa was necessary as much for strategic reasons (threats from South India) as for economic reasons: Gokanna, which was what they called the Trincomalee Harbour, was closer to the latter region, and with the expansion of trade with the West, being near it made good sense. 
From AD 1232, the capital began to move from Polonnaruwa, this time further down to the south west. Again, this was motivated by both military and economic concerns, since trade had by then shifted from India and the West to China, the worlds biggest single economy, which on an unprecedented scale was opening itself up to the world outside. Though it would take the Ming Dynasty, a century or so later, to give effect to this process (and, in one of the many maritime voyages it sponsored, even invade our country), around the 13th century China was becoming a more powerful arrival in the trade sector (as Kamalika Pieris put it). With Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa, Sinhalese civilisation pioneered a hydraulic civilisation never before seen on such a scale elsewhere. The bisokotuwa, an invention of the third century BC (the founders of which havent been identified by historians) laid the foundation of a culture that thrived on a sleek relationship between the wewa and neighbouring tanks. Both these kingdoms had been able to withstand the pressures attendant on such places: intermittent streams, gross yearly variations, undulating relief, high evaporation some eight degrees from the Equator, poor groundwater resources, indifferent soils, and marked seasonal concentration of rainfall with its risk of disastrous floods, among others. The dry zone had to do with rainfall restricted to the period from September to January, which was less reliable than in the wet zone. The marvels of engineering and water conservation constructed during this period, then, would be modified and adapted to meet the needs of the subsequent kingdoms. Dambadeniya was the first testing ground for how well those marvels could withstand the shift to a new centre of power. All in all, it passed the test rather well: not only did it find refuge in the many fortresses which shielded the kingdom, it also fermented a civilisational renaissance. For the Dambadeniya Era was the bedrock of a revolution in literature. It gave birth to the kavsilumina, the sandesha kavya, and the Dalada Siritha. It also gave birth to the Muvadevdavata and the Saddharma Ratnavaliya. 
Curiously enough, while being shielded from South India, the writers of this era, to compensate perhaps for the infiltration of South India, imbibed the traditions of North India: the heavily ornate, alankarist (sophist) style of Sanskrit poets. By the time of the 15th century, the process of cultural assimilation (or imitation) this necessitated was virtually complete; it would be continued, with minor modifications, in the 20th century with the Colombo poets. At the same time though, it did not abandon the peoples quest for a genuine national literature: it was during these centuries that the Sidat Sangarava was written and, according to Wilheim Geiger, the shift towards Modern Sinhalese transpired. Dambadeniya, and Kurunegala among its kingdoms, was hence a place of contradiction as well.
Resettlement
Still, it was not always fortunate for Sinhalese civilisation to have moved so abruptly to a new region. The turbulence which marked the first few outside conquests, even those of the Cholas, had been combated and resolved. But the 13th century saw a very different wave of conquests, more merciless since it compelled the abandonment of the heartland of ancient Sri Lanka. 
The process of resettlement this compelled was made more difficult by other factors, prime among them malaria, which added a further and insuperable obstacle to the reoccupation of the once productive areas of the dry zone. Not surprisingly, by the mid-14th century, with the rise of the Aryachakravarti Kingdom in Jaffna (the most powerful in the island), the monuments to our irrigation system, the tanks and the reservoirs, were fast deteriorating, physically and metaphorically. Deterioration on such a scale could not be halted or paused, and it went hand in hand with the decline of irrigation cultures in South East Asia: in Cambodia, northern Thailand, and Burma. 
Our people were always resilient in the face of outside threats. They faced the biggest series of invasions from the 10th to the 13th centuries, which would have been enough to put down any civilisation. But Martin Wickramasinghe once wrote that this culture of resilience, which survived the Cholas, the Pandyans, and the Pallavas, was probably rooted in the Buddhist ethos the people readily imbibed. Was it because the court poets, the prose writers, and even the kings of these centuries began to abandon that ethos which had run through the literature of the preceding centuries that, during and after the Dambadeniya Era, a period of decrepitude got rooted in the country 
Dambadeniya, and with it Kurunegala, was a kingdom that flourished in the realms of the sacred and the worldly. It was the bedrock of modern Sinhalese, the language and the literature. It was the classical era for scholars and writers. And yet, it was also a place of contradictions, of a Buddhist civilisation coexisting with a secular culture. It was this history that I sought to explore with the two days I spent in Kurunegala. 
To be sure, by itself, Kurunegala does not span the entirety of Dambadeniya, which is why I explored Yapahuwa and Panduwasnuwara as well. Still, Kurunegala is special to me, because of the many glimpses it affords: the people, the sights, and the sounds. These, more than the cultural sites, may yield something of value with which we can look at the residents more wholesomely. Those two days I spent, therefore, seem to have been aptly spent. In the coming weeks, I intend to chart them for you.

UN raises concerns over VAT increase
	
Visiting UN Expert Juan Pablo Bohoslavsky today expressed concerns over the Sri Lankan Governments decision taken in May 2016 to increase the Value Added Tax (VAT) from 11 per cent to 15 per cent.
Juan Pablo Bohoslavsky, the UN Independent Expert on the Effects of Foreign Debt on Human Rights said, I am concerned by the significant raise of the VAT tax rate, climbing from 11 per cent to 15 per cent in 2016, since the cost of such tax is borne by the poorest part of the population. In fact, revenue collection through VAT has seen an acceleration to 56.5 per cent in 2017, he said addressing a news briefing in Colombo.
He said recent reforms in Sri Lanka have resulted in rationalization in energy and farming subsidies, fuel price being now set with an automatic market-based mechanism and the price of electricity is about to be de-regulated along the same mechanism.
However, he said he was concerned about the impact of such measures on the livelihood of fisher, farmers and rural communities households.
It is my view that such cuts should at least be compensated through cash transfers targeting those in need and ensuring that they reach the beneficiary in a timely and efficient manner. Investments in the rural economy should be directed in supporting the livelihoods of these small-scale producers so they will be resilient against these subsidy reductions targeting those in need, he said.
