Aid convoy with Prabhakarans pics arrives in Kerala
	
A caravan of trucks bearing flags similar to that of the LTTE and a banner with the picture of the slain LTTE Leader Velupillai Prabhakaran had arrived in Kottayam, Kerala with flood relief material, Indian media reported today.
According to the Manorama online, the police had questioned the volunteers and sent them back as they realised the latter were members of the Tamil nationalist party Naam Tamilar Katchi (NTK) which is headed by Tamil Nadu filmmaker and actor Seeman.
The NTK members had off-loaded relief materials at the Armed Reserve Police Camp in Kottayam town on August 25 evening, prompting several officials including the Additional District Magistrate to reach the spot.
They were questioned in detail at Kottayam East police station. They revealed that they had earlier distributed relief materials at camps in Idukki and Munnar too last week. The activists, who belong to Madurai, Theni, Kambam and Kumily, had arrived here in 25 vehicles loaded with relief materials.
Though the materials they delivered were examined by the bomb detection and disposal squad and sniffer dogs, nothing suspicious were found.

The results of 2018 Advanced Level Examination could be delayed due to a shortage of teachers to serve at answer script evaluation supervisory board, the Chairman of the All Ceylon United Teachers Union (ACUTU) Ven. Yalwela Pagnasekera Thera said.
This year there are only eight teachers in each supervisory board, where 14 teachers are necessary for each board, he said.
Lower payments paid to teachers on the supervisory boards, failure to inform in advance about holding the boards on regional basis and dejection among teachers have resulted in the fewer number of teachers, he said.
The holding of Supervisory Boards in the outstations began this year.

Bloodshed on Atrocious August 12 : The assassination of legendary Kadirgamar and Hartal 53
	

We have to live in Sri Lanka as Sri Lankans tolerating all
	
	First and foremost Sri Lankans, then race and religion-something given to us at birth
	
	Hartal on August 12, 1953, was to protest the move to withdraw the rice ration subsidy.
	
	Hartal means Strike Action; it was first used at some stages in the Indian freedom movement

Killing, slaughter and mayhem are awfully linked to August 12; counted in the Gregorian Calendar as the 224TH day of the year [or the 225th day in leap years], which falls 3 and 6 days after the destruction of two cities in Japan, the Land of the Rising Sun by Little Boy and Fat Man Nuclear Bombs respectively, which instantly killed over 200,000 people and maimedhundreds of thousands more.
The start of the shooting season of the red grouse and the rock ptarmigan, also known as the Glorious Twelfth for the English and Irish is August 12. Red grouse and ptarmigan are medium-sized game birds which are found in Great Britain and Ireland.
August 12-International Panorama of Tragedies In the war front August 12 was the last engagement of the First Crusade. Battle of Ascalon Crusaders, who, under the command of Godfrey of Bouillon, defeated Fatimid Forces in 1099. 
In 1121  The Georgian army under King David IV wins a decisive victory over the famous Seljuk on August 12, while in 1164, at Battle of Harim in Nur ad-Din Zangi, defeated the County of Tripoli and on August 12. 
In Soviet Union [Russia] the infamous The Night of the Murdered Poets where thirteen prominent Jewish intellectuals, who were a part of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, were murdered in Moscow on August 12, 1952. 
All defendants were accused of espionage and treason. They were tortured, beaten, and isolated after their arrests before being formally charged.
Assassination of Kadirgamar We have to live in Sri Lanka as Sri Lankans tolerating all races and religion, said Lakshman Kadirgamar, during a BBC interview, when he was asked if he thought he was a traitor to the Tamil people since he was a Minister in a Sinhalese-dominated Government. 
People who live in Sri Lanka are first and foremost Sri Lankans, then we have our race and religion, which is something given to us at birth. 

Prabhakaran, who targeted him for a fairly long time succeeded finally. One of the most loved Statesman of Sri Lanka ..he was a man who treasured his country

While At Trinity College, he captained the cricket team in 1950 and also competed in athletics and rugby teams. 
He was a Rugby Coloursman, Athletics Lion, and winner of the first Duncan White Challenge Cup for Athletics. Lakshman as the Senior Prefect of Trinity College was awarded the prestigious Ryde Gold medal for the best all-round student of 1950. A Hero of our times, Kadirgamar sacrificed his life for his Motherland 12th August 2005. Regaining the image of Sri Lanka was not an easy task that Lakshman Kadirgamar undertook after he became Foreign Minister in CBK government. 
He did this by countering the LTTE propaganda in the West by exposing them as a brutal terrorist organisation that engaged in the mass destruction of life and property while calling themselves freedom-fighters. 
His untiring efforts successfully put a halt to funding raising in many Western nations when governments decided to impose a ban on the outfit. Hailing from a Tamil family in Jaffna, Lakshman Kadirgamar was born in Colombo. 
His father was Samuel J.C. Kadirgamar, JP- UM a Proctor, who became President of the Colombo Proctors Association and also the founder President of the Law Society of Ceylon. He had four elder brothers; S.J.C. Kadirgamar Jr., QC; Rear Admiral Rajan, who became the Commander of the Royal Ceylon Navy and Major Selvanathan of the Ceylon Artillery 
On August 12, 2005, Lakshman Kadirgamar was felled by an LTTE terrorists bullet. 
Prabhakaran, who targeted him for a fairly long time succeeded finally. One of the most loved Statesman of Sri Lankas, he was a man who treasured his country.
Kadirgamar was a scholar, a lawyer, and a gentleman politician. Once the fearless politician confronted a top UNDP diplomat who tried to meddle in our foreign relations during his tenure as Minister. He attained international prominence as a diplomat and a Foreign minister of a developing nation due to his wide-ranging condemnation of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam [LTTE]. 
He was elected Vice-chairman (9799) and later chairman (200305) of the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation. In 19982001 he was Chairman of the Council of Ministers of SAARC. From 1999 onwards he was also a Chairman of the South Asia Foundation (SAF) an NGO. 
Condoleezza Rice, US Secretary of State condemned the assassination of Kadirgamar as a senseless murder and vicious act of terror and she urged Lankans not to let it lead to recommence war. She commended him as a man of dignity, honour and integrity, who devoted his life to bringing peace to Sri Lanka. Kofi Annan, Secretary General UN said in a statement: Sri Lanka has lost a deeply respected statesman dedicated to peace and national unity.
Hartal 53 Nine Rioters shot dead on August 12 Hartal means Strike Action; it was first used at some stages in the Indian freedom movement. Leaders of Lanka Sama-Samaja Party who in the early 1940s escaped prison and sneaked to India where they participated in the freedom struggle themed Quit India: The alien term Hartal which they borrowed from the Indian counterparts was introduced here by them. 
The perception, a mass protest campaign, demanded virtual abstinence from work. The campaign concerned with mass demonstrations against an illegal, unacceptable, irregular, or unpopular decisions by an administration that affects a wide section of oppressed people was put into practice by the Marxist on August 12, 1953. 
12 August 1953 in Sri Lanka, the tremendous power of the masses was on display. Hartal demonstrated beyond doubt that the government of Dudley Senanayake lost the confidence of the voter but has also earned the peoples strong dissatisfaction. 

The campaign concerned with mass demonstrations against an illegal, unacceptable, irregular, or unpopular decisions by an administration that affects a wide section of oppressed people was put into practice by the Marxist on August 12, 1953. 

The vast expansion of the masses which 12 August observed in villages and towns symbolized nothing less than an active vote of no-confidence and a demand that it should resign immediately. It was a notice doled out that the people could endure it no more. 
Marxist leaders conducted factory gate meetings to alert blue-collar workers, while others called at villages taking the Hartal idea to their strongholds. The Lanka Sama Samaja Paksha [LSSP] and Communist Party [CP] published special Hartal editions in their news-sheets countering wild allegations. There had been an extensive uprising on August 12 by an angry crowd who rose in spirited protest. Their strongholds in the Western, Southern and Sabaragamuwa recorded the widest protest and aggression, while in Kandy, Jaffna, and Nuwara Eliya contribution in protest was seen in the form of work stoppages which resulted in the total disruption of transport. The closing of shops, display of black flags, and rallies were other forms of protest. 
The events of 12 August was not an outbreak of hooliganism but a veritable peoples uprising. The administration broke its election pledges, ignored the disapproval of the people, and declined to let the public decide the matter by a general election. The enraged masses rose in active dissent. The entire August 12 movement was a democratic movement despite its insurrectionary nature which reached districts along the western and south-western coastal territories, like Maharagama, Boralesgamuwa, Gangodawila, Kirillapone, Egoda Uyana, Katukurunda, Koralawella, Waskaduwa, Karandeniya, Dompe, Akurala, Totagamuwa, Hikkaduwa, and Rajgama. 
A mass assembly was designed by the Leftist parties who controlled 80 to 90 percent of the trade unions in the island to protest the abolition of free midday meal to school children; pruning of the food subsidy, and the new tax proposals, that received publicity ahead of the staging of the budget by Finance Minister J R Jayewardene, on the afternoon of July 23rd. 
The promise of highly subsidized rice ration of two measures per week, per person [Appr. 2 kilos] at 25cents a measure was reiterated by the UNP government at the 1953 Parliamentary elections campaign. The party manifesto stated, as long as Sun & Moon exists it will remain intact. They won comfortably. 
However, drop in the balance of trade and consequential depletion of foreign reserves caused a big economic crisis in 1952/53 financial year, and it was further catalysed with the ending of Korean War boom compelling the state to impose a cruel cutback in rice subsidy. 
The Hartal on August 12, 1953, was to protest the move by the government to withdraw the rice ration subsidy. It turned out to be an aggressive mass uprising that gave jitters to the rulers. It caused loss of lives, the devastation of state property. 
At the height of the disorder, a panicked Cabinet withdrew to a British Warship docked in the Colombo harbour along with senior officials, from where they carried out the State affairs. Martial Law and curfew were imposed; Dudley Senanayake, the PM was compelled to issue an order to shoot at sight. The rioting men and women stood defiantly; the Police opened fire causing nine deaths. 
Following the tragedy the PM once collapsed in the chamber under stress and was flown to London for treatment, but failed to recover on his return; the great man taught a lesson to politicians by resigning from the post of Prime Minister, and the leadership of UNP.

## Title: Crisis ridden mother Lanka weepsIntractable causes are many

Crisis ridden mother Lanka weepsIntractable causes are many
	

Religion and spiritual development of an individual or rather the lack of it as the main reason for much heart-aches
	
	If we harm the environment it would consequently impact disastrously on the living conditions of the people
	
	Wasting time and tax payers money in a futile exercise without utilization of it gainfully for discussing policy matters

Mother Lanka has no doubt had to shed copious tears for 30 long years during which period the ethnic conflict raged in all its fury between the minority Tamil community and the majority Sinhala community due to the formers demand for a separate state.
Apparently now the militants of the minority community, who master-minded the conflict have been militarily destroyed but not silenced, and there is an uneasy calm prevailing in the battlegrounds, where the the worst of the violence took place and both the minority community and the majority community have had to pay an enormous price by way of human life and destruction of property.
I am sure the readers are well aware of the history relating to this conflict and the ultimate victim was Mother Lanka whose agony and anguish has moved her to the shedding of much tears just as it happened
Be that as it may, today the reason for Mother Lankas tears is something altogether different. Mother Lanka as we all are aware is a multi ethnic, multi-cultural, multi-religious nation which is politically a multi-party democracy. In such an environment conflicts are bound to arise.
Notwithstanding this fact, I wish to state at the outset in this first segment that religion and spiritual development of an individual or rather the lack of it as the main reason for much heart-aches which has caused immense sorrow for Mother Lanka for the reason that without a firm spiritual foundation the moral values of a nation would be undermined.
Therefore I wish to pose the question as to how far the major religions have contributed towards ensuring that people of all communities and religions live amicably with each other as sons and daughters of Mother Lanka up-holding moral and ethical values, Is the weeping of Mother Lanka caused due to her dissatisfaction and disappointment as a result of the failure on the part of the major religions to bring about this situation
If so why have they failed Was it due to the fact that they have been merely paying lip service to the tenets of their faith and confining the practice of their religion to the observance of rituals while giving scant regard to the importance of living according to the teaching of its founders. 
We have to seek honest answers to these questions deeply exploring the underlying reasons as to why the religious leaders have allowed religion to be exploited and misused by politicians to create division among the communities that exist in this nation and thereby achieve their ulterior motives
Since Buddhism is given priority and pride of place in the Constitution of Sri Lanka, it is pertinent to ask those who are supposed to be repositories of Buddhas teachings and preachers of Buddhist Philosophy, who are expected to exemplify the teachings of the noble Gautama the Buddha in their manner of living, whether they are really fulfilling this obligation or acting in violation by being all too eager to encourage followers to go the way of politics and politicians who hanker after power and cheap popularity and thirst for monetary benefits whose conduct is anything but moral and is the antithesis of the doctrines of Buddhism which emphasizes the practice of dhana, sila and bahavana and admonishes to observe moral conduct.
In this second segment of causes, I wish to touch on a matter, which is as important to the public life of the citizens of Mother Lanka as religion, which is politics the playing field of many who aspire to easy money. It is in this arena of politics over which the sons and daughters have to engage in much soul searching introspection, in order to create a disciplined and morally upright society and stem the bitter tears of Mother Lanka.
The fact that Sri Lanka is a multi-party democracy is in itself detrimental to the efficient functioning of the democratic process for the reason that, when there are an unlimited number of minor parties contesting an election the two major parties (UNP & SLFP) which have been alternatively ruling the country have to seek their assistance to form a stable government, as a result of which a power struggle takes place with the bargaining power of the minor parties becoming stronger.
If at all one of the major ruling parties forms a government in a coalition with the support of the minor parties, whose agenda may not altogether be compatible with those of the majority party, thereby the stability of the government is threatened. It is the nature of Sri Lankan politics to put the interest of the party before those of the country which is very unfortunate consequent to which, the politicians in power will not think twice about plundering the country for their own benefit due to this mentality of putting the cart before the horse and having no sense of accountability. The representatives elected to Parliament to serve the people have been very often been found to be serving themselves instead, being induced to subvert the process of good governance through corrupt practices with the acceptance of bribes, and betraying the trust the people have reposed in them.
Politicians who claim to be Catholic though few in number, are ever more confident in declaring their Catholicism, but when it comes to the crunch, they are not exactly St. Thomas More.
The massive financial frauds, money laundering and the criminal breach of trust, that have rocked the economy of the nation to its chief financial foundations by defrauding an Institution such as the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, is a fact that is all too well known and the Central Bank Bonds investigation Commission and the outcome, about which it has been extensively reported by the secular media consequent to the perpetration of which, heavy financial burdens have been placed on the people and making the nation to be ridden with an insurmountable debt burden. 
When Parliament meets, much of its members time is taken up in disparaging accusation being levelled by the opposition against the government and vice versa, thus wasting precious time and the tax payers money in a futile exercise without utilization of it gainfully for discussing policy matters that affect the development of the country.
How many out of the 225 members in Parliament, who claim to hold high moral ground can truthfully say according to the dictates of their conscience, that their political career is pure white as the garment they are attired in when they critically point fingers at each other and indulge in such fruitless and wasteful behavior, when the country is already having a massive debt burden on her shoulders Is this the reason for which they were sent to Parliament Is this not a good enough reason for Mother Lanka to weep
The third segment which has caused Mother Lanka to weep in anguish is over the degradation of the environment and the extensive and wanton destruction of its fauna and flora. An incident which I would like to highlight is the killing of protected species of mammal according to Section 30(2) of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, where a leopard which is a protected species was brutally killed in cold blood, an act that was most disgusting and morally reprehensible and should be condemned in no uncertain terms.
As it is all too evident that if we harm the environment it would consequently impact unfavourably and disastrously on the living conditions of the people which situation was faced by the nation due to the recent upheavals and havoc caused by cyclonic winds, torrential rains, floods and landslides as a result of which many people were rendered homeless and their livelihoods destroyed due to lack of proper planning by the powers that be, not forgetting the prolonged periods of droughts causing depletion of water resources.
Encroachment of forest reserves by human settlements, paving the way for human elephant conflicts about which wide and regular coverage and publicity was given in the daily news reports telecast by the electronic and print media. Destruction of elephant habitations due to the opening up of forest lands for chena cultivation thus depriving the elephant population of their natural habitats and elephant corridors resulting in human and elephant casualties giving further reason for Mother Lanka to voice her loud and long lamentations. 
When writing about the environment there is an important aspect which is peculiar to Sri Lanka is the manner of garbage disposal which has a serious impact on the environment.
Neither the present government nor any of its predecessors had attempted at making a sincere and concerted effort to work out and implement a technically viable plan of action for the disposal of garbage, as a result of which there has been large scale pollution of the environment. In this context, I quote from the Encyclical letter Laudato Si No.139 care of our common home of His Holiness Pope Francis, wherein he speaks saying when we speak of the environment what we really mean is a relationship that exists between nature and society which lives in it. Nature cannot be regarded as something separate from ourselves, or as a mere setting in which we live. We are part of nature, included in it and thus in constant interaction with it
Fourth and final segment about which Mother Lanka moans and groans is the breakdown of the law and order situation and the escalation of violence perpetrated against society individually and by way of organized crime and related to it is the ever increasing infiltration of a large quantity of contraband drugs into the country insidiously targeting the school going population, which are being detected on a daily basis by the Police Narcotics Bureau and reported in the secular news media. The situation seems to be so alarming and appears to be getting out of control, so much so that the President has deemed fit to implement the death penalty selectively on those convicted to death by the courts for trafficking in drugs and still persisted in masterminding the drug cartels, while languishing behind bars in the Welikada prison, for the express purpose of eradicating the drug menace. In this context it is pertinent to ask, are those who are responsible for enforcing law and order failing to carry out their responsibilities Is there a lapse on the part of Prison officials in strictly enforcing Prison regulations Is there a break-down of law and order Why is there an escalation of crime be it organized or otherwise Why is there so much disrespect for law and order and for those entrusted with the task of enforcing it Are the lawmakers protecting encouraging and giving refuge to the lawbreakers for political or personal gain or making use of those so called under-world gangs to carry out attacks against their political opponents
Mother Lanka will continue to weep until she gets satisfactory answers to these questions and crime is totally eradicated from this Island nation which may be a Utopian dream  let us dream the impossible dream, let us do what is possible and leave the impossible in the hands of God, for nothing is impossible for God and in He will make this nation assured of a safe dwelling place for His sons and daughters to live in peace and harmony making Mother Lanka smile again.

Data Science Enthusiasts Explore Emerging Trends at Colombo Big DataMeetup Powered by Virtusa
	
Selvendra Selvarajah, Associate Architect at Virtusa
Industry professionals, big data enthusiasts, academics and students congregated at the latest edition of the Colombo Big Data Meetupheld recently at the Virtusa auditorium. Powered by Virtusa, the interactive sessionsapprised participants of the latest developments in Big Data tools and technologies. Selvendra Selvarajah, Associate Architect at Virtusa and Sajeetharan Sinnathurai, Microsoft MVP and Senior Tech Lead at 99X Technology delivered the key note addresses of the evening.
The session kicked off with a presentation by Selvendra Selvarajah on the increasing use of R programming language in industry. A leading open source programming language consisting of powerful functions to tackle all problems related to Big Data processing, it has been used only in academics, historically. However, recent developments have seen it being more commonly usedin industry. Selvendra believes this latest trend will make Big Data analytics easier for most programmers as it eliminates the requirement for fresh graduates to learn a new programming language or use another program. Additionally, the open source nature of the language allows it to be continuously developed with improvements being freely available soon after.
"Microsoft has begun including R language in their development process making it more popular than ever. This makes the lives of programmers that much easier as they can directly apply what they learn in university to real world situations. The ready-to-use statistical modelling algorithms and machine learning nature of R language help speed up the process as well. This makes R language invaluable for analytics driven companies and essential for those looking to create value from stored data, he said.
Sajeetharan Sinnathurai, Microsoft MVP and Senior Tech Lead at 99X Technology
Sajeetharan Sinnathurai came in next and delved into the practical applications of sentiment analysis. He took the audience through the different steps involved in building a sentiment analysis solution using the Azure platform. A live demo was run to extract data from Twitter and, with the participation of the audience, sentiment analysis was applied on the resulting data. Sajeetharan believes that in an age where social media can have a profound impact on a business, sentiment analysis can help businesses better understand their customers. It can guide market strategy, assist crisis management, influence product development, help monitor brand reputation, and be utilized for competitive benchmarking as well as inform a host of other business outcomes.
The key to business has always been knowing what your customer wants and at a time where customers are constantly updating their social media with their thoughts and emotions that information has never been more accessible. However, unlocking the hidden value of that raw data can be tedious and overwhelming if we were to do it manually by reviewing every post ourselves. This is where solutions provided by platforms like Azure come into play. With the implementation of Azure Logic Apps, Text Analytics API, Azure SQL DB and PowerBI we can harness powerful insights from a single country or across the globe quickly and easily, he said.
The Big Data meetup has been taking place each quarter since 2014 with the participation of many industry professionals and academics. The eventhas proven popular amongst its target audience with the community growing to almost 3000 strong. Having recognized this as a great platform to bring enthusiasts, students, academia and the industry together and engage and update them on the latest in the world of Big Data, Virtusa has been an active part of this forum, right from its inception.
Tharindu Buddhika, Senior Software Engineer, Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC,has been an active member of this community and a key organizer of the event since its inception. Hebelieves that the popularity of these sessions can be traced to the fact that it bridges the gap between academics and industry. It fills in that additional bit of knowledge that fresh graduates need when joining the IT industry while giving veterans in IT the opportunity to keep abreast of the latest trends.
When we started these sessions about four years ago Big Data was only an emerging field but we knew right then that it would play a big part in IT simply because at that time in history there was more data being created and collected than ever before. This meant that Big Data analysis would have a wide array of applications across several industries and if Sri Lanka wanted to be a part of this emerging trend then we needed to get our IT professionals and undergraduates thinking and learning about Big Data. Hence we began these meetups as a way of spreading the message but it soon grew into something more  a community that allowed us to share our thoughts and insights on the subject, noted Tharindu.
A cross-section of the audience
He also believes that these sessions play an integral part in making Big Data popular within the local IT industry.

Devoted husband remembers a loving wife Till we meet again
	
It is with a sense of deep sadness I write about my loving wife Victoreen. M. Hassan. We spent a happy and peaceful wedded life for almost 40 long years and Victoreen passed away peacefully on August 25, 2008, after a brief illness. Vicky, ten years have passed since I lost the light of my life.
Although you cannot hear my voice or see my smile, no more you will walk beside me still just as you did before. Vicky, I feel the love you had for me and hear you in my heart, even though you left your human vessel your soul will never part. Your gentle loving, admirable, qualities, and sincerity were evident at the crowds that thronged at your last journey.
It broke my heart to walk beside you on that fateful day. I think of you in silence and often speak your name... Victoreen.
Now all I have are memories and a photo in a frame. Your memory is a keepsake, from which I will never part. Today, tomorrow and forever my whole life through, I will always love and cherish you. In secret I weep, in silence, I cry, as each lonely day passes by.
There is only one thought that eases the pain and its knowing we will be together again. Loving thoughts till the end of a time of a wonderful wife I am proud was mine.
For all, you gave me and our children through the years, your time and love your prayers and tears, your patience, caring, and sharing is still a memory. For all this and more I STILL LOVE YOU.
Gods hand touched you and took your last breath, closed your eyes and slipped away to the land of no more pain.
Vicky, God has taken care of you so you dont have to be afraid. The pain I feel losing you will never go away from my mind. Your loving smile, your gentle face no one can fill your vacant place.
You meant the world to me and I really loved you so. Each night I shed a silent tear as a message to you in prayer to let you know that I love you Vicky, and just how much I care for you.
Thank you for your endless love, that helps through each day. Youre the wife I loved, and I was proud to be your husband and every day in a small way I celebrate your life.
Finally, thank you Victoreen for the wonderful and generous sacrifices you made for me, our children, and all the loving care and affection you showered on us. I remember not what I did for you, but I was for you, and what you were to me. Thank you for loving me and being what you were.
Darling Vicky, our special years will not return, when you were with me together, but love within our hearts you will walk with me together.
Till we meet again,
Sadly missed by your loving husband

Driving Trishaw: NTC to study ban on age limit
	
The Transport Ministry would appoint National Transport Security Commission to study and analyze the ban imposed on three-wheeler passenger transport, sources said.
The Government earlier considered banning the issuing of trishaw driving licence to persons less than 35 years of age.
The existing National Council for Road Security will function as the National Transport Security Commission for the relevant task, Deputy Transport Minister Ashok Abesinghe said.
There are more than 700, 000 three-wheeler drivers below 35 years, while the total registered number of three-wheelers are 1, 200, 000, according to the Chairman Sunil Jayawardena of the Self-employed Three Wheeler Drivers Union.
The ban is still not in operation and the matter is being investigated and public opinion will also be entertained before coming to a solution, the deputy minister said. (Dayaseeli Liyanage)

Flood toll in Indias Kerala rises to 445
	

KOCHI AFP, Aug 26, 2018 - The death toll from devastating floods in the southern Indian state of Kerala rose to 445 Sunday with the discovery of 28 more bodies as the waters recede and a massive cleanup gathers pace, government officials said.
Around a million people are still packed into temporary relief camps and 15 are reported missing even as the government mounts an operation to clean homes and public places that have been filled with dirt and sand left by the floods.
Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in a tweet said that more than 130,000 flood-hit houses had been cleaned, or nearly a third of those affected.
Authorities are also in the process of restoring electricity connections.
People returning to their homes have been told to stay alert as receding waters leave behind a glut of snakes. State authorities and wildlife experts have formed teams to come to the aid of those who have found snakes in their home, according to local media.

Mnangagwa takes oath as Zimbabwean President
	

THE HINDU, 26th AUGUST, 2018-Emmerson Mnangagwa took the oath as Zimbabwes President in front of a stadium crowd on Sunday after a divisive election, as U.S. observers of that vote questioned the countrys democratic credentials.
The Constitutional Court confirmed Mr. Mnangagwa as President in a ruling released on Friday, dismissing a challenge by the man he defeated in the July 30 ballot, opposition leader Nelson Chamisa.
Thousands of people, some bussed in from outside the capital, and foreign leaders gathered at Harares national stadium for the swearing-in of Mr. Mnangagwa, who just secured the 50 percent of votes he needed to avoid a runoff against Chamisa.
He took the oath before Chief Justice Luke Malaba who, together with eight other Constitutional Court judges had dismissed Chamisas petition.
The election was touted as a crucial step towards shedding the pariah reputation Zimbabwe gained under Mr. Mnangagwas predecessor Robert Mugabe, and securing international donor funding to revive a crippled economy.
But hours before Mr. Mnangagwas inauguration, the International Republican Institute and National Democratic Institute said the country lacked a tolerant democratic culture in which political parties were treated equally and citizens allowed to vote freely.
The election was marred by procedural lapses and followed by an army crackdown against opposition supporters, undermining promises that Mr. Mnangagwa made during campaigning to break with the corruption and mismanagement that become endemic under Mr. Mugabe.

Not just testing, even nuclear weapons need to be banned
	
Wednesday, August 29 is the United Nations International Day Against Nuclear Testing and Sri Lanka, with two of our neighbouring countries, being nuclear powers, needs to give much attention to the dangers or even catastrophe from nuclear tests or the use of nuclear weapons.
In a statement to mark the event, the UN says since nuclear weapons testing began on July 16, 1945, nearly 2,000 have taken place. In the early days of nuclear testing little consideration was given to its devastating effects on human life, let alone the dangers of nuclear fallout from atmospheric tests. Hindsight and history have shown us the terrifying and tragic effects of nuclear weapons testing, especially when controlled conditions go awry, and in the light of the far more powerful and destructive nuclear weapons that exist today.
The international instrument to put an end to all forms of nuclear testing is the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which, unfortunately, has yet to enter into force. On December 2, 2009, the 64th session of the UN General Assembly declared August 29, the International Day Against Nuclear Tests by unanimously adopting the resolution. It calls for increasing awareness and education about the effects of nuclear weapon test explosions or any other nuclear explosions and the need for their cessation as one of the means of achieving the goal of a nuclear-weapon-free world.
The resolution was initiated by the Republic of Kazakhstan, together with a large number of sponsors and cosponsors with a view to commemorating the closure of the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site on August 29, 1991. The Day is meant to galvanize the UN Member States, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, academic institutions, youth networks and the media to inform, educate and advocate the necessity of banning nuclear weapon tests as a valuable step towards achieving a safer world.
2010 marked the inaugural commemoration of the International Day Against Nuclear Tests. Each year, since then, the day has been observed by coordinating various activities throughout the world, such as symposia, conferences, exhibits, competitions, publications, lectures in academic institutions, media broadcasts and other initiatives.
Since the International Day Against Nuclear Tests was first declared, there have been a number of significant developments, discussions and initiatives relevant to its goals and objectives as well as conferences convened to elaborate and advance these developments. On February 5 this year, the United States and Russia met the central limits on the Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms.
But the major problem today relates to North Korea. During the past two years, the North Korean regime has reportedly conducted several nuclear tests and even claims it now has the ability to hit areas in the US. The enraged US President Donald Trump -notorious for his lies, inconsistency and dangerous unpredictability- slammed the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un as the little rocket man. Mr Trump threatened that if North Korea did not stop its nuclear tests the US might consider military retaliation. Then there was a complete turnaround. The two leaders had friendly telephone calls and an historic summit was held in Singapore recently.
The US Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo visited North Korea several times after that and was due to go there again this week. But amid reports that North Korea was not taking effective steps towards denuclearization, President Trump told the Secretary of State to postpone or cancel the visit.
With Mr Trump in deep legal trouble after several of his close advisors turned against him and have agreed to give evidence to federal prosecutors probing his alleged misdeeds including collusion with Russia, there is concern as to what Mr Trump may do now and how North Korea will retaliate.
In the long term, Pope Francis has called on world religious leaders to come together in a mission, not just to stop or curb testing of nuclear weapons, but ban the possession of such deadly weapons, which could destroy the world within minutes. If the worlds religions come together along with peace activists, they may be able to make some progress for the world to become a safer place to live in.

## Title: oDoc at Work: app launches corporate subscription packages for unlimited medical consultations
## Section: Press Releases

oDoc at Work: app launches corporate subscription packages for unlimited medical consultations
	
An oDoc terminal set up at the Dial Textiles factory sick room which is accessible to all 750 employees
oDoc, Sri Lankas video medical consultation platform, has introduced an employee healthcare solution for businesses. oDocs corporate subscriptions present organisations with a compelling new option to offer employees unlimited fully paid doctor consultations from anywhere, including at corporate and factory sick rooms.
oDoc is a smartphone app that connects patients with doctors for instant video consultations. It gives patients access to an SLMC registered doctor eliminating the need to brave traffic and spend hours in a hospital waiting room. In addition, patients benefit from expert advice, receive instant E-prescriptions (if medically required), and even have medicine delivered straight to their door, for no extra charge. It all takes place within a few clicks of a smartphone through a trilingual app designed and developed entirely in Sri Lanka.
The American Medical Association has found that nearly 75% of regular doctor visits can be handled effectively through video or audio consultations. This form of healthcare delivery has gained global acceptance and is in wide use in countries including the US, the UK, India, Japan and Singapore.
The oDoc platform has been up and running for close to a year now. It counts over 180 GPs and specialists including many senior consultants. All doctors on oDoc are equipped with a dedicated application to manage oDoc consultations and issue prescriptions. oDocs newest initiative, corporate subscriptions, follows the use of the platform by over 11,000 Sri Lankans.
The oDoc team demonstrates the app to employees at Aramex
The corporate subscription package is designed to increase productivity. It is a company health benefit that allows employers to provide their employees, and optionally the employees immediate family, with unlimited access to the doctors on the oDoc platform. The company has developed a business model that allows these subscriptions to be priced as low as Rs. 25 per employee per month, making the service affordable for both large and small businesses.
We want this to complement traditional forms of employee health coverage, which usually covers just a limited number of OPD visits. In essence, this is unlimited OPD cover for your employees, says the companys CEO and Co-Founder Heshan Fernando. With oDoc, your employees will not only have instant access to GPs, but also to specialists, including paediatricians, gynaecologists, cardiologists, and dermatologists.
An area that stood out to the team that needed improving was the cost and quality of healthcare provided to non-executive staff, especially in the manufacturing sector. Factories both large and small traditionally operate a sick room where they have a nurse stationed, but would only get a qualified doctor coming in for a few hours each week. This is highly inefficient because the staff members would usually wait for the doctor to arrive and then queue up to see him. It is also costly for the factory in terms of sourcing a visiting doctor. At the end of the day, productivity is lost, as care is not available when and where it is required, leading to higher instances of illness, infection, absenteeism and presenteeism, Fernando said.
Keeping with the mission of the company to offer high-quality affordable healthcare to all, the team at oDoc worked to offer an alternative. Fernando explained: We proposed installing an oDoc access point, complete with a pre-loaded tablet in factory sick rooms, whereby any staff member can walk in, talk to a doctor within 3 minutes, get instant advice 24/7 and even a prescription if medically required. We have already launched at several partner factories, and its proving to be a success.
Over 15 companies have currently signed on to the service including some of the countrys largest corporates such as MAS and Brandix and multinational insurance providers such as AIA. Even family-owned SMEs have signed on. Faiz Brothers, a Pettah based hardware supplier, now offers all its 15 staff members unlimited consultations through oDoc.
oDoc corporate subscriptions are tailored to companies such as FaizBrothers in Pettah to cater to the healthcare needs to 15-20 employees
oDocs venture into corporate subscriptions promises to be an interesting new option for corporates looking to offer better care options for their employees whilst boosting productivity. It is expected that similar digitisation initiatives being undertaken by Sri Lankan corporates and manufacturing sector companies will contribute towards boosting the countrys competitiveness and economic performance by utilising technology to its fullest potential.

Padmavati: Its her face stupid, not her navel
	

The film glorifies the Rajputs and vilifies the Islamic conquerors from Afghanistan
	
	The film has been a commercial success, and Karni Sena and Bhansali have officially patched up their differences

Sanjay Leela Bhansalis epic about a legendary Rajput queen, her warrior husband and a marauding Muslim conqueror leaves you both appalled and awed.
Its visually breathtaking. But the films comic book characterisation and what looks like a glorification of Jauhar, the ancient Hindu custom of women of the defeated side committing ritual suicide by fire, is enough to make one squirm.
As the film starts, a statement to the effect that the film does not encourage in any way women to throw themselves into bonfires flashes across the screen. But the frenzied visuals at its end suggest just the opposite. The production was plagued by protests, and cinemas were ringed by armed police on opening day (imagine a Sri Lankan filmmaker getting that kind of protection). The director and two assistants were physically attacked, and mobs threatened to burn down the set, forcing the director to move locations. They even threatened to cut off the nose of Deepika Padukone, who played the role of Padmavati.

Bhansali is a product of the religion-dominated political culture as exemplified by the BJP. Thats a tragedy even greater than that of Padmavati and Bhairao Mastani

But all the protests were for the wrong reasons. Before the film opened, Hindu women threatened mass suicide in honour of Padmavati. The chief troublemaker was Sri Rajput Karni Sena, a nationalist Rajput organization which thought that the film was an insult to Rajput pride and the Padmavati legend. Its hard to see why, as the film glorifies the Rajputs and vilifies the Islamic conquerors from Afghanistan. But alls well that ends well. The film has been a commercial success, and Karni Sena and Bhansali have officially patched up their differences. A letter to the movie maker signed by Karni Sena high ups said that they do not have any objection about screening the film in Gujarat and Rajasthan, and Deepika Padukone didnt have to go for a plastic nose job.
The films sensuous texture, from period interiors to tents billowing like sails and staggeringly detailed costumes, all in matching colours, overwhelms the viewer from the start. But when it comes to the two lovers (if one might be presumptuous enough to call them that) this sensuality is always held in check. Kissing scenes are now possible in Hindi cinema, though still not the norm. In this case, the royal lips come tantalisingly close but sadly, some man-made disaster intervenes to keep them apart. The director has wisely avoided this regal predicament. If not, the Rajputs would have declared total and unconditional war (the Rajput equivalent of the Fatwa) on him.
Comically enough, one protest was that the virtuous queens navel gets too much exposure in the film. In fact, one notices very little of it. Rani Padmavatis face and torso, made up and adorned in exquisite period detail, steals all the attention from her navel. Its the beauty of her face, as described by the revenge-seeking Brahmin adviser who defects to the Muslim side, which makes the fearsome Alauddin decide that he must have her at any cost.
If anyone, its the Muslims who should have protested. Alauddin Khalji (Ranveer Singh), a historical figure and the films villain, is shown to be a sadistic, treacherous figure who kills his father-in-law, his childhood friend and anyone who stands in his way to power and eats roasted meat like a savage. In one scene, he makes a captive Indian princess stand in a pool of water, holding up two burning torches chained to her hands, while he circles the pool, taunting her.
Sadism and brutality existed on both sides during the war. Many Muslim rulers were refined men. Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, wrote his autobiography. Others, like Akbar and Shah Jahan, were tolerant patrons of music and arts. Some, like Jehangir, was cruel religious fanatics. But you can find such examples on the Hindu side, too.
Alauddin is not all brute force in the film. He responds to fine music and regrets that he cannot write poetry. But such moments of sensitivity and finesse are harshly overridden by the overall image of an unwashed, scar-faced and lusty brute madly in love with himself and power. If that wasnt bad enough, hes shown to be bisexual. This is a tradition which goes back to Alexander the Great, and beyond. But when the villain has this trait and all Rajputs in the film are very progressively heterosexual, that does nothing positive for Indias beleaguered LGTB community.
By contrasts, Rajput King Ratan Singh (Shahid Kapoor) and Queen Padmavati are both physically and morally beautiful. The script shows her to be politically more astute than her husband, as she warns her husband that sultan Alauddins invitation to him might be a trap. But he believes in chivalry and noble conduct in war. Not that the entire Muslim army is shown to be treacherous. When Alauddin is seen to be losing his duel with Ratan Sing, and his boyfriend and general Malik Kafur Jim Sarbh) gets ready to kill the latter with an arrow, a fellow commander tells him thats against the rules of war. But Kafur retorts that what matters is to win.

Sanjay Leela Bhansalis epic about a legendary Rajput queen, her warrior husband and a marauding Muslim conqueror leaves you both appalled and awed

But such sops to minority sentiments are useless when weighed against the films overwhelming pro-Hindu bias. This one-sided portrayal doesnt diminish the films considerable dramatic power but diminishes its artistic value. What a pity, because Padmavati at times has the dramatic power of Ridley Scotts Gladiator. Indian epic filmmaking has come of age. From Asoka to Yoda Akbar and Bhansalis previous historical epic Bairoaho Mastani, they are impressive feats of filmmaking, and our own budget epics look amateurish, even inept, by comparison.
The historical events in the films cant be determined exactly, except for the siege of Chittor by Alauddins army. There are several versions of the Padmavati legend and she is not a historically verifiable figure (some say she lived in the 13th century, others put it as the 14th). That hardly matters, because films based on historical events, from Ridley Scotts Gladiator to the more recent biopic about Winston Churchill, can distort history or even invents events. Gladiator is a good example of deliberately distorting history for dramatic effect.
Emperor Marcus Aurelius, for example, wasnt killed by his son Commodus. But Commodus was one of the worst tyrants to rule from Rome. He was actually worse than the character in the film. Commodus, as emperor, revelled in Gladiator games and slaughtering animals.
He even dressed up disabled people as mythological creatures so that he could kill them in one of his gladiator spectacles. Also, Commodus wasnt killed fighting anyone in the arena, as the film shows. He was killed in a bath by his mistress Marcias accomplice.
The biggest flaw in Padmavatis storyline is the black and white portrayal of Hindu and Muslim rulers and their politics, and its glorification of the Jauhar tradition. 16,000 Hindu women marching stridently like beautifully draped zombies towards a bonfire, while deterring the bewildered conqueror by throwing charcoal at him, cant be described as anything else. As for Rajput heroics, the king is so steeped in macho tradition that, when Padmavati makes a deal with Alauddin and gains access to the chained, bedraggled figure, Ratan Singh berates her for dealing with the enemy for his sake. Even to commit suicide, she must ask for his permission, which doesnt say much for the status of Indian women of that era.
And that battle scene where a Rajput general carries on fighting even after his head rolls off his head is simply ludicrous. As Indian critic Uday Bhatia put it, the Rajputs were known to make terrible tactical mistakes and die to fight bravely, and Padmavati is forced to choose between fire and a murderous lunatic who makes parrot noises.
American critic Rachel Salz was even more cryptic in her dismissal of the film: Padmavati and her king, Ratan Singh, dressed in gorgeous silks and bangles, are more heaven to look at than delightful to know.

As the film starts, a statement to the effect that the film does not encourage in any way women to throw themselves into bonfires flashes across the screen. But the frenzied visuals at its end suggest just the opposite

Nonetheless, there is much one can salvage from this one-sided extravaganza. Bhansalis use of folk music for the score is interesting, and the dance sequences are often enchanting, though its hard to understand why sultan Alauddin performs a break dance with his warriors at one point. Despite such faux pas, the film is enjoyable if you can forget its finger-in-the-eye racism and other prejudices.
Bhansalis earlier epic Bhairao Mastani, also featuring Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh (she as the Muslim warrior princess Mastani, and he as the Rajput warrior Bhairao who falls in love with her) was a more balanced film, with the same exquisite period detail but more historical insights into the realpolitik of the time  the fearsome dominance of Brahmins and that loathing for the Muslim invader which clouded judgement (Mastani is the daughter of Hindu ruler by his Muslim wife) and defeats idealist and romantic love. There is a very well-executed song-dance sequence too, where Padukone and her fellow dancers perform in carrying medieval lutes and in semi-European costumes.
All this is in the tradition of Bollywoods best moments, but in contrast to the secular tradition of Indian filmmaking of as exemplified by Satyajit Rai, Bimal Roy and Raj Kapoor (in their different approaches), Bhansali is a product of the religion-dominated political culture as exemplified by the BJP. Thats a tragedy even greater than that of Padmavati and Bhajirao Mastani.

Pompeo decries abhorrent ethnic cleansing in Myanmar
	

REUTERS, 26th AUGUST, 2018-The United States will continue to hold accountable those responsible for what he described as the abhorrent ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Saturday.
Pompeos statement came on the one year anniversary of the conflict in western Myanmars Rakhine state that drove more than 700,000 Rohingya from their homes into neighbouring Bangladesh.
A year ago, following deadly militant attacks, security forces responded by launching abhorrent ethnic cleansing of ethnic #Rohingya in Burma, Pompeo said on Twitter, using an alternative name for Myanmar.
The U.S. will continue to hold those responsible accountable. The military must respect human rights for #Burmas democracy to succeed.
The military ruled Myanmar for nearly 50 years after seizing power in a 1962 coup and retains considerable powers under a 2008 constitution.
Myanmar government spokesmen Zaw Htay was unavailable for comment on Sunday.
The government, led by Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has denied refugees allegations of atrocities, saying security forces lawfully suppressed Muslim militants in Rakhine. Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh held demonstrations and prayers on Saturday to mark the anniversary of the outbreak of the conflict.
Thousands of refugees marched prayed and chanted slogans in events across the sprawling camps in southern Bangladesh. Many wore black ribbons to commemorate what they said was the start of the Rohingya genocide.

Sri Lankas tech industry continues to develop at a commendable pace, but unfortunately we are yet to see the same kind of disruptive innovation on the same scale as advancements in most developed and emerging economies  particularly in relation to analytics and research capabilities. This is why SAKS Analytics is now working to establish global partnerships that will serve to introduce such disruptive technologies to the domestic market.
Govind Sandhu - Co-Founder & COO, AntWorks

Todays agreement with AntWorks represents a bold and vital step forward in this vision that promises to usher in the same kind of hard-nosed, data-driven approach to business that we see taking hold across the region, SAKS Analytics Managing Director, Jeevan Gnanam, stated.

In addressing unstructured data, AntWorks has redefined the current landscape of the automation industry. Its proprietary platform, ANTstein is the first and only, intelligent, integrated, end-to-end automation platform available in the market today. It is the only data ingestion technology that does not use OCR and is built on the principles of fractal science. In comparison with other current players in the RPA domain, AntWorks has integrated Cognitive Machine Reading for multi-format data ingestion, RPA for data transport, and Machine Learning coupled with Natural Language Modelling for advanced data insights, all under its single sign on the ANTsteinTM platform.

Companies today are constantly in search of new avenues to increase efficiency and expand margins and we are confident that our partnership with AntWorks will deliver on this promise for Sri Lankan enterprises, and over time, even to clients across the region, Jeevan Gnanam added.

Part of the real attraction with the services that SAKS is now able to offer is the unprecedented level of flexibility and adaptability that are the hallmarks of what AntWorks is doing with its cognitive and AI tools. Whether it is a large multinational or a micro-enterprise, we provide the capability to process large volumes of documents and perform advanced analytics that are usually very difficult to tease out of raw data. This is information that will support intelligent and agile decision-making that provides optimized returns to the enterprise.

Jeevan Gnanam  Managing Director, SAKS Analytics & Hariharan Padmanaban - Head Business Development, SAKS Analytics

The platform would be easily capable of adapting to the varying needs of businesses across industry verticals  providing base returns of between 10% to 25% on a given organizations bottom line, if not more, Hariharan Padmanaban explained.

SAKS and AntWorks will also be placing special emphasis on solutions geared to support Sri Lankas sizeable healthcare sector.

While the Sri Lankan healthcare system continues to face serious challenges, particularly in terms of facilities and infrastructure, the overall quality of service in the country is actually quite high. There is a lot of interest in what relatively smaller investments into technology can do to further enhance the quality and delivery of healthcare services nationally.

Here too, AntWorks has some very robust capabilities in documentation automation and analytics that we believe could spark a wave of innovation across the public and private sectors, with the ultimate beneficiary being the Sri Lankan people, Jeevan Gnanam stated.

The relationship between AntWorks and SAKS Analytics has been a long-standing one with preliminary discussions on their partnership having commenced in 2016. A start-up that is headquartered out of Singapore, AntWorks is now present in four continents with development centers in India and in the United States of America with plans to open delivery centers in Singapore, London, and the Philippines shortly.

Driven by the principle of customer first, we strive to be at Zero Distance to our customers to enable fast and fearless delivery of fresh technologies, this partnership with SAKS Analytics enables rapid adoption of our solutions in Sri Lanka, while maintaining Zero Distance from our customers, said Asheesh Mehra  Co-Founder and Group CEO of AntWorks.

Autonomous operations are a vital part of how AntWorks approaches new markets and so in Sri Lanka, SAKS Analytics will utilize their knowledge of local dynamics, in creating unique products and solutions to address the needs of enterprises in Sri Lanka to enhance productivity, reduce time to market and increase customer delight. I am excited at the potential that lies ahead with this partnership, said Asheesh Mehra. He also noted that both companies would look to collaborate on the development of specialized products and solutions for the Sri Lankan market over the mediumlong term.

## Title: SL Army focuses on Global Disruptions and National Security

SL Army focuses on Global Disruptions and National Security
	
The Colombo Defense seminar the apex seminar organized by the Sri Lanka Army is to be held on 30th and 31 August. This year the seminar will focus on the theme of global disruptions and implications on national security. Global disruptions have been the focus on many policy and academic conversations in the 21st Century. The impact global disruptions can have on national security is a very pertinent and timely conversation.
As Sri Lanka is struggling to set up a coherent national security and foreign policy strategy, understanding and responding to the interweaving impacts of global transformation is a must for academic, policy and security establishments to deliberate upon. This article attempts to function as a prelude to the important deliberations that are to take place at the defense seminar and connect it with Sri Lankas security interests.
The Colombo defense seminar is taking a four pronged approach to address global disruptions, the key focus will be on demographic shifts, technological transformations, especially cyber and Artificial intelligence (AI) futures, transforming Urban security landscape and the political extremism that is challenging policy makers globally. The seminar is taking place at a time of ongoing political crises, geo political rivalries and political polarization strafing the Sri Lankan body politic.

Sri Lankas security narrative
While the above is true, how our security thinking has evolved especially post conflict era needs to be revisited along with seeking answers to how are we shaping our future security strategy Sri Lankas future security discourse is heavily influenced by the evolving maritime competition in the Indo Pacific Ocean. The current administration, especially Prime Minister Wickramasinghe has taken a keen interest to deepen the Ocean security discourse and analyze its impact.
Currently there is an ongoing debate about the role and composition about the future role of the Sri Lanka Army. What is more important apart from the downsizing debate is identifying what role will the Army has to play and what types of challenges it will have to face in defending Sri Lankas national security. These may include gearing up for increasing political warfare which is making a comeback in this century.
Political Warfare
The concept of political warfare was prominent during the Cold War, where both the Soviet Union and United States used an array of military and nonmilitary interventions in countries from arming militias, changing education systems, values to creating political propaganda to counter the spread of democracy or communism. Post-Cold war era saw a retreat of political warfare.
In the aftermath of the 2016 US Presidential election, many American security experts tend to agree that Russia has mastered a new form of political warfare that enables it to intervene in democratic States to change political outcomes of democratic forms of politics such as elections, civil society and press.
American think tanks claim that the United States have actually failed to adapt strategies to contain political warfare in the 21st Century, a strategy Americans were good at when they were intervening in domestic politics of countries using a panoply of weapons of statecraft, during the cold war has returned to haunt them in the 21st Century.
The geo political shocks of the external power struggles will have a serious impact on Sri Lankas national security, if political warfare erupts the fall out will be felt heavily on Sri Lanka. Political warfare has the ability to undermine political systems, governance, democracy and increase ethnic tensions, arm radical militias and the splintering can be across multiple fault lines. In Sri Lanka the two key fault lines are ethno-religious and a possible radicalized left. As both these trends have a history in Sri Lankas conflict landscape.

Climate Change Challenges
Another key area that global militaries are significantly concerned about are the humanitarian catastrophes of climate change induced climate events and possible weaponization of the climate. Both needs a military that is sensitive and sophisticated enough to comprehend and mitigate the challenges. Climate scientists are arguing we are entering an era of Weathers of Mass Destruction (WMD). Climate change is creating a set of acute challenges accelerating extreme weather events that leads to social and political vulnerabilities and related conflicts.
A classic example is the emerging geo strategic importance and rivalry to dominate the Arctic. America, China, Russia are engaged in a massive military buildup while European powers are looking at increasing there economic gains by using the Artic as a trading route. In a few days a merchant vessel registered to the Danish shipping giant Maersk will use the Northern Arctic sea route. Though commercial shipping in full flow may at least take another decade, a decade back what Maersk is doing right now was unthinkable. This is purely a consequence of climate change and global warming.
The security and strategic challenge for a military is not merely studying climate change, but a military that can arm itself with climate data, especially for a country like ours, which is an island nation in the Indian Ocean. A classic example though not from state sector is the acquisition of Climate Corporation a digital agriculture company that provides farmers with weather, soil and crop yield data by Agricultural behemoth Monsanto five years ago for a Billion dollars.
Climate Corporation was in the possession of 30 years of weather data, 60 years of crop data and unprecedented amount of crop yield and soil data. The power such information puts in the hand of one company is alarming yet that is the way information and data is revolutionizing industry and politics.

Technological Disruptions
The technological disruption is the speed demon of all the modern social and political disruptions. Technological developments in the 20th Century came at a much slower pace, it took even in the United States 45 years for some of the US households to be electrified, the telecommunication sector since its late 19th century invention and despite heavy use in the two world wars, still took 68 years to reach a majority of people even in the developed world. Yet the Internet has connected and reached a majority within two decades. The next concern is how fast will Artificial intelligence take over key human tasks and these has significant political and security implications

Imperatives for the Sri Lankan Military
Sri Lanka needs to invest in a strategic advancement center within the Sri Lanka Army or as a joint force apparatus, a center that has experts, analysts, including civilians with an industrywide cross sectional integration. Such an initiative will aid in identifying and strategizing to mitigate coming challenges from Climate Change, patterns of violent political extremism and constant cyber political incursions.
Sri Lankas army needs access to real time data, it needs access to analysts and experts who can crunch the data provide geo strategic projections, this will enhance not just the situational analysis of the military but also of the political leadership. Today we are mostly engaged in military debates that belongs to the 20th century while we are increasingly pressured by 21st century challenges emanating from unprecedented global transformations.
For most of the post conflict period the, military mantra was civil military relations. The future of Sri Lanka Army may require a more civil military partnerships especially with industry, think tanks and the academia. Most modern militaries have already started deeper engagements with civilian sectors especially in the realm of geo politics, geo economic and technology.
The professional advancement of the military needs to be a priority it cannot play the role of the key national safeguard if it does not have the knowledge, insight or intelligence that is needed to face challenges that emerge from global disruptions. It needs the professionalism that can see through political failures, and not succumb to partisan political motives. Sri Lanka military could benefit from the joint force doctrine, where the Army, Navy and the Air force along with a civilian intelligence infrastructure may have to work as a seamlessly integrated defense architecture to confront threats and adversaries of the 21st Century.

STAX presents research on investment and FTA potential at SL-Singapore Business Council AGM
	
Firaz Markar, Manager-Digital Advisory at STAX, addresses the SL-SG Business Council board and representatives of companies with business ties with Singapore.
To raise awareness on current and future investment potential in Sri Lanka, leading management consulting firm STAX delivered a presentation on the SL-SG FTA and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) dynamics and opportunities, at the recently concluded Annual General Meeting of the Sri Lanka-Singapore Business Council.
The meeting, which took place at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, was attended by the board of the SL-SG Business Council, together with representatives of companies maintaining business ties with Singapore.
Drawing on STAXs extensive research capabilities and experience operating in the Singaporean market, Manager Firaz Markar presented an overall view of key challenges in investment, potential opportunities for investment and growth, and the significance of the SL-SG free trade agreement to council member companies.
Singapore and Sri Lanka continue to share significant cultural and economic affinities, and over the past year, this relationship has manifested in increasing trade. Today, Singapore ranks as Sri Lankas 8thlargest trading partner, and at present, there are over 90 Singaporean businesses  including major multinationals  that operate in the country, generating approximately 241 million dollars in investment in 2017.
Many of these companies choose to invest in Sri Lanka to take advantage of regional and relationship-driven benefits. Sri Lanka has the benefit of positive relationships with some of the largest economies in the Asian region, as well as access to trade routes and markets. However, while FDI has been improving over the recent past, we still attract investments at a much lower rate and scale than its regional counterparts.
He further explained how most of Sri Lankas FDI had been generated through the telecommunication, manufacturing, and tourism sectors, while the IT sector had also shown improved potential with export growth of 18-19%.
Citing the results of a recent study carried out by STAX among foreign companies that have invested in Sri Lanka, he noted that the most pressing concerns for foreign investors remained a shortage of qualified labour, the high cost of setting up business, insufficient levels of productivity, and policy instability.
However, given the potential of Sri Lanka as a hub for regional trade, Firaz stated that a positive conclusion to the SL-SG FTA would serve as a signal for other nations to also enter into similarly liberal agreements with Sri Lanka to take advantage of reductions in tariff lines, labour movement and government procurement.
Such a transformation would enable Sri Lanka to serve as a gateway for global firms to gain access and negotiate deals with the ASEAN bloc, potentially expanding the scope of Sri Lankas economy by several orders of magnitude.
Liberalization of labour movement is of course a complex issue, but if policies stipulate that companies that have invested and set up businesses may be allowed, within specific criteria, to have some movement of labour, the Sri Lankan economy as a whole will benefit strongly, Firaz stated.
He advocated for the establishment of a clearly defined and articulated national value proposition across industries, moving forward. This is in parallel to financial incentives geared to sustainably attract capital into key industries keeping with a portfolio approach to FDI.Ideally, all this would be managed under a single umbrella organization tasked with setting and enforcing rules and guidelines.
In that regard, he noted that the 50% reduction in tariff lines - which will grow to 80% over the next 12-15 years - together with the first ever inclusion of government procurement will enable unprecedented opportunities for Sri Lankan businesses to compete for government contracts in Singapore. Similarly, it would incentivize Singaporean companies to engage in similar projects locally, enabling the country to benefit from the introduction of improved standards, international best practices and knowledge transfer opportunities.

TNA to join Presidential Task Force against C.V's wishes
	
Tamil National Alliance (TNA) has ignored a request by Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran to boycott the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on the development of the Northern and Eastern Provinces and would participate in a meeting of the task force scheduled for today (27).
The Northern Chief Minister had made the above request claiming that the government was attempting to undermine the long-awaited political solution to the ethnic problem by increasing economic activities in the region.
It would not affect the Tamils in any manner if the TNA joins the Presidential Task Force, PLOTE Leader cum Parliamentarian Dharmalingam Siddarthan said.
He said that the TNA had decided to join the Presidential Task Force with the consent of the Tamils as well as with the goal of fulfilling the needs of the Tamils.
"There would be no harm caused to the impending political settlement nor other matters that pertain to the Tamils by being part of the task force mooted by the government. This is not a decision taken to oppose the NPC Chief Minister either," the PLOTE Leader re-iterated.
He said that when the Parliamentary committee meeting of the TNA was held recently, the view expressed by Wigneswaran to the effect that the TNA should not join the Presidential Task Force was discussed at length. Thereafter, the TNA decided to take part in the process for the sake of the people.
"The decision was made jointly by the constituent parties of the TNA, namely, TELO, PLOTE and the ITAK. Although I was absent, our party members were present," he said.
Mr. Siddharthan said that it was decided that there was no point keeping away from the development work that had started but to forge ahead with the political settlement whilst taking part in the activities of the task force.
"By not attending the meeting of the task force there is not going to be an immediate political solution and hence it was decided to take part in it while fulfilling many projects as much as possible. This decision was not made for personal wealth or influence, but with the desire for development," he said. (S. Nitharshan)

Who are Alathi Ammala
	
By L.B. Senaratne
As we view the Kandy Esala Perahera, we see a colourful procession of men, elephants and banners. But, little seems to be known about the behind-the-scenes rituals of the Sri Dalada Maligawa.
The Esala Perahera is not only about parading the Golden Karanduwa. The ritual performed during the Kandy Esala Maha Perahera season gives the entire festival more significance and meaning.
Amidst these busy preparations, there are two very important women, who are indispensable during the performance of rituals.
Their duties have been passed down from generations and their families have served the Sri Dalada Maligawa for years. They themselves are not aware of an exact date or period of when their duties began. They only know that they come from two families - the Ranaweeras.
For years I have been trying to delve into the status symbols and how they were first put in place to become the two most indispensable women during this festival.
But there is no record as to how they came to serve the Sri Dalada Maligawa and join its retinue. However, they are very much part and parcel of the establishment.
These two women are known as the Alathi- Ammala. There is no corresponding word in English to describe them. Their ritual is simple but dignified and they are present every Wednesday for the Nanumura Mangalya, (The bathing of the Sacred Relic) during every Vesak and Poson Day as well as every day of the Esala Maha Perahera or the exposition of the Sacred Relic.
The ritual is simple yet dignified. What one notices is that two women with lighted wicks dipped in pure coconut oil, goes and place them on a betel leaf and step into the Inner Shrine.
However, what they really do inside the Shrine Room is a matter of conjecture.
We are told that it is a simple but sacred ritual. They do not speak about it and no one asks them. Only the serving priests know what they do.
Some years ago when the Venerable Rambukwelle Vippassi Thera was the Mahanayake of Malwatte Chapter, while waiting inside the inner chamber during an exposition, we discussed as to how this office of Alathi Ammala came into place at the Sri Dalada Maligawa.
It was said that this type of office existed during the time of the Walli Yak Mangalaya at Maha Vishnu Devale.
At that time the elder Alathi Amma was Ranaweera. The Mahanayake Thera summoned one of the two in service and asked them whether they know about how they came into office.
They replied, that their duties are bestowed upon them when the elder office bearer passes away, but are unable to trace their origin.
The Mahanayake noted in his observations, it could be that the Kings at that time were Hindu or aligned to Hinduism, though they performed Buddhists rites. So, it is a custom that the Mahanayake was not certain of.
But it could be attributed to the fact the Hindu Kings used women for blessings, whenever they leave the Palace for official functions and when he returns to the Palace to ward off the evil eye.
The Mahanayake said that it could be that ritual, which was carried out on the King and that this same ritual is also carried out to the Sacred Relic.
This ritual is to say Ayu -Bowan thrice with lighted wicks placed on a Betel leaf. It is a simple process, but a dignified one.
