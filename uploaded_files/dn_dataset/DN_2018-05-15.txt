Three top ruggerites to join CR
It is reliably learnt that three top ruggerites  former St. Peters College Bambalapitiya rugby captain and skipper of the Sri Lanka under 20 Asian sevens cup champion as well as present Sri Lanka national sevens utility player Kevin Kutty Dixon, ex Wesley College/Sri Lanka national fifteen a side hooker Dulanjana Wijesinghe, and last years Isipathana College and Asian under 18 cup champion sevens skipper and centre Sumudu Rankothge have joined CR and FC and will most probably turn out for the Longden Place club in the upcoming 2018/19 rugby season.
The Red Shirts who finished in fifth place out of eight teams in the league championship last season will try to regain their lost prestige by aiming at winning the coveted league championship that has eluded them for the past 20 years in the upcoming 2018/19 season under the leadership of captain Kavindu Perera and head coach Nilfer Ibrahim.
They last won the league in 1998 under the captaincy of scrum half Champika Nishantha.

Tightening of global financing conditions will be gradual- Moodys
Sovereigns with relatively short average maturity of debt and weak debt affordability are generally the most exposed to a larger than expected rise in borrowing costs, Moodys Investors Service said in a report yesterday.
Moodys central forecast is that the anticipated tightening of global financing conditions will be gradual. However, financing conditions could tighten more rapidly than Moodys currently assumes, either globally or for specific sovereigns.
In a study of 125 rated sovereigns, Moodys analysed the sensitivity of sovereign fiscal metrics to two hypothetical interest rate shocks, one moderate and gradual and one severe and more immediate. Both shocks are assumed to be sustained over four years.
Moodys concludes that a moderate shock would generally be manageable, with limited impact on sovereigns debt affordability and debt burdens other than for those which already exhibit very low fiscal strength. A severe shock would pressure a broader set of ratings.
The sovereigns most vulnerable to an interest rate shock are generally low rated, with shorter maturities and weak debt affordability, said Elisa Parisi-Capone, a Moodys Vice President -- Senior Analyst and co-author of the report. In our view, exposure to a shift in financing conditions is highest for Lebanon (B3 stable), Egypt (B3 stable), Pakistan (B3 stable), Bahrain (B1 negative) and Mongolia (B3 stable). Sri Lanka (B1 negative) and Jordan (B1 stable) are also highly exposed.
At the regional level, Latin America, the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa are the most exposed regions to shocks through weaker debt affordability. For Sub-Saharan Africa, a sudden and sharp rise in the cost of borrowing would add to refinancing pressures ahead of large debt maturities due early next decade.
Large emerging markets such as Argentina or Indonesia are not among the sovereigns most exposed to the impact on fiscal metrics of a tightening in financing conditions, generally because they benefit from a long average maturity of government debt that reduces the credit impact of a sharp rise in interest rates.

Unidentified virus kills five children at Karapitiya hospital
An unidentified virus has resulted in the deaths of five children in Ward 1 of the Childrens Section at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital in Galle over the last few days.
According to hospital sources, several more children are currently suffering in the ward.
The doctors are not sure whether the children caught the virus while in the ward or it is as a result of any other infection from a disease they were already suffering from.
When the Daily News contacted the Galle Karapitiya Teaching Hospital Director, Dr. Jayampathy Senanayake, he confirmed the deaths of the five children. At first we thought it was a bacterial infection, but now we have confirmed that it is a viral infection. We have however not been able to identify what kind of a virus this is or put a name to it, he said.
A special discussion had taken place at the hospital yesterday with regard to the virus and steps have been taken to send the blood samples of the children to Colombo for further testing.
Dr. Senanayake also confirmed that there were other children infected with the same virus in the ward, I cannot tell you much now. We are conducting investigations into this, he added.

US, Lankan surgeons conduct first ever robot-assisted surgery
US and Sri Lankan surgeons conducted the first ever robot-assisted surgery aboard the USNS Mercy on May 4, the US Embassy in Colombo said yesterday.
The joint team of multinational surgeons and medical professionals successfully completed a cholecystectomy, or gall bladder removal, on a Sri Lankan citizen using a Da Vinci XI Robot Surgical System.
This landmark surgery advances the boundaries of what is possible through collaboration, skill, and technology, said US Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Atul Keshap.
We are proud to partner with Sri Lankan medical professionals on this ground-breaking achievement for the international medical field.
This was the first time I have ever operated aboard a ship, said Dr. Vyramuthu Varanitharan, a general surgeon at the Muttur Base Hospital.
It is very stable and doesnt move around. It felt as if I was doing surgery in an operating room in a hospital. It was a fantastic experience to have been able to do surgery on a hospital ship and it is something my team and I will never forget,Dr.Varanitharan said. Intensive planning and preparation resulted in a smooth and routine surgery. After the successful completion of the surgery, the patient transferred to the Mercys post-anesthesia care unit to recover and was later discharged from the ship in excellent condition for routine post-operative follow up care by Dr. Varanitharan. Pacific Partnership is the largest annual multilateral disaster response preparedness mission conducted in the Indo-Pacific.

Viber assures more secure connections
Given the recent outcry over privacy options on social networks by users, leading global messaging and voice app, Viber has taken careful steps to ensure data remains secure and private.
Growing concerns have also risen about certain social and messaging apps harvesting private messages and using them as valuable data for their systems algorithmsor for their advertisers.
Given that there are over eight million Viber users in the country and the phenomenal growth of Viber stickers with more than 100 million being sent and received monthly among Sri Lankans, Viber assures all users of have automatic protection through encryption.
Vibers default end-to-end encryption provides stronger security in every voice or video call, message, video and photo, in both group and one-on-one messages where not even Viber can see, read or have access to them.
Anubhav Nayyar, Head of South East Asia Viber said, Sri Lanka is major market in South Asia for Viber and we understand privacy and security is a serious concern among our many users. While other messaging applications may require users to manually enable encryption, end-to-end encryption on Viber is on by default so users dont have to worry about turning it on and has been standard on the app since the feature was made available.
When a Viber message is sent, whether on mobile or desktop, the data travels from the device to the recipients as a scrambled code so that only their device has the unique key to translate to plain text.
Once the message has been delivered, none of the data is stored on Vibers servers. In case the device is offline, Viber stores only the encrypted version of the message for a limited time, still safe and secure, until their device connects to the internet and is able to receive what has been sent.
Viber is all about making sure our users can enjoy better ways of communicating every day, and a big part of that is assuring that the connections made are strengthened by secure measures users can always count on, Nayyar noted.

voicing Solos !
When I entered Dr Manela Joseph, Pathologists (retired) resident in Embuldeniya, she invited me in with a sweet smile while humming the song All things bright and beautiful.
I saw the scenic beauty, just out of the window, away from the concrete town of Moratuwa, beyond the green paddy fields with golden rods, green wilderness and fruit-filled trees and vehicles zooming across the road like colourful toys. For her beauty can be defined as an early morning as the whole area is dotted with colourful birds singing merrily and the scent of farmers reaping fresh harvest.
Q: How did you get into the medical field and music
It was instinct which led me to singing. I belong to a family of six and I am the eldest of the family. We are Catholics. In the late evenings we would get together and sing many classical songs. We all possessed equally good voices. I was a student of the Our Lady of Victories from the Kindergarten to Ordinary Level. In the mid 60s, there were no strong restrictions. You are sent a letter if you had even three C passes. Entering a university was not difficult. One has to be very intelligent to get a C pass. My mom used to say that even my first few words as an infant were melodious. She knew that I was destined to sing.
Q: Did the electronic era influence your passion for singing
No, in 60s we never saw a TV. It was the radio and the togetherness in the family which kindled the musical sense in me. We listened to our parents advice and sang, played, and studied while we were seated on the floor and our parents were on seated on the sofa.
Q: Apart your medical work and being a vocalist you are also an expert on the piano
I was gifted a piano-accordion when I was nine years. I became the best piano player in 1962 after playing Beer Barrel Polka at the All Ceylon Piano Accordion Contest. Piano I played to the ear and I am still going strong.
Q: How did you pursue your dream in becoming a instrumentalist and a vocalist
From my school days I was a solo singer and good at harmonizing in group singing. I was encouraged by Mother Kenem who trained my voice.
Me and my sisters: Melani, Liwan, Nilan, and Iromi and my brother sang at a party in 1970 when we were in our teens. Music Director NissankaWimalasooriya appreciated our talent and got us down to record the two songs Roshi and Ranmonaru composed by the Late Clarence Wijewardane and another two English songs Wake up and Picnic on the Beach.
At that time I did not know about the copy right reserved issue. I composed lyrics, set them to melody and taped them trying to enter the music market which I failed as I had to follow the rules. There was not much demand in the market for English original songs in Sri Lanka. My first cassette comprised of 12 songs -10 English and two Sinhala songs.
Q: Did you benefit from them
No, not at all. At that time the English songs were badly exploited. There was no commercial value. It was only Radio Ceylon and small music parlours which offered very low royalty.
The music industry was highly corrupted. However I continued in the field because of my pleasure and passion for the art. There were no avenues for our English originals to go over the waves beyond the horizon. It was a very sad situation. However our media embrace what came from overseas. This is not the case in India. They respect their language and they are highly conversant in English. The Ebnglish songs that they sing are also embedded with their culture and they provide high proficiency to English songs. Sri Lanka should also follow suit by encouraging our own home grown material.
Q: Does the funds for your work come from your own pockets
Though my husband, Joseph and I are both doctors, I am not that rich. I am grateful to the State Pharmaceutical Corporations for constantly donating an amount for the work. Several other private hospitals too have contributed to the projects.
Q: How do you see yourself in the future
I am in a way a Philanthropist. I am always looking out to help the needy. The Mighty Blessings of God has always been with me throughout my journey.

After 7,895 days and 1,235 games
Wenger bids emotional farewell to Arsenal
HUDDERSFIELD, Sunday: Arsene Wenger admitted it was hard to keep his emotions in check as the Arsenal manager brought the curtain down on his 22-year reign with a 1-0 win at Huddersfield on Sunday.
After 7,895 days and 1,235 games, it was 'au revoir' to Wenger as the Frenchman took charge of Arsenal for the last time.
Wenger has been on a nostalgia-tinged long goodbye since Arsenal announced last month that his historic reign would come to an end once the season was over.
And the 68-year-old was overcome with emotion before and after Arsenal's last game of the Premier League campaign.
"Of course it is very emotional after 1,235 games for the same club," Wenger said.
"To enjoy it we had to win it, winning football games is what makes me happy and the boys did it.
"Do I feel relief Not really, I'm sad. At some stage it has to end, I wish everyone well, the fans have been great until the end and I wish the club well for the future."
Greeted by headlines asking 'Arsene who' when he was hired in 1996, Wenger departs firmly established as Arsenal's greatest manager.
He won three Premier League titles, including the famous 2003-04 unbeaten season, and seven FA Cups, while revolutionising English football with his ground-breaking use of sports science and scouting of players from previously untapped markets like Africa.
Fittingly, it was a 38th minute goal from Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang -- the last major signing of the Wenger era -- that ensured his manager went out on an uplifting note.
"I believe I had an impact on the club as a whole because the club is in a strong position, it has a new stadium, a new training ground and new players," Wenger said.
"With the results we won three Premier League titles, played 49 games unbeaten and I'm very proud to have won seven FA Cups too."
Having spent the last two seasons enduring abuse from Arsenal fans frustrated by their club's failure to win the title since 2004, Wenger's farewell tour has been played out to a soundtrack of praise.
Wenger was given a guard of honour before kick-off at the John Smith's Stadium and the feelgood atmosphere peaked in the 22nd minute -- marking his number of years in charge -- when he was afforded a lengthy period of applause from the entire stadium.
Two planes flew over the stadium, carrying messages reading; "Merci Arsene, we will miss you too" and "One Arsene Wenger".
But for all the stirring goodbyes and Wenger's hints that he wanted to stay on for another year, Arsenal's struggles this season sealed his fate as they missed out on a place in the Champions League for a second successive campaign.
A sixth place finish -- 37 points behind champions Manchester City -- was a reminder how far Arsenal's standards had slipped in Wenger's final years. AFP

This government commits corruption unlimited, he said
Maintaining the government and its ministers is costly now. The public has to spend Rs. 560 million monthly to maintain the Cabinet, he said.

Zverev powers past Thiem to win Madrid Masters
Madrid, Sunday: Dominic Thiem lost to Alexander Zverev in the Madrid Masters final on Sunday and then said the German is now the best player in the world beneath Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.
Zverev has long been marked out as a future star of the men's game and his 6-4, 6-4 victory over Thiem suggests the German can be a major threat at the French Open later this month.
Thiem had ousted Nadal in the quarter-finals on Friday and he too will be among the small group capable of preventing the Spaniard from claiming an 11th Roland Garros crown.
But the Austrian was outplayed, and over-powered, by Zverev, who collects his third ATP World Tour Masters 1000 title, the most prestigious tier of knock-out tournament beneath the four Grand Slams.
Zverev is now one of five active players to have won three, the others being Federer, Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray.
Those four are all aged 30 or older, while Zverev is 21, with Djokovic and Murray both attempting recovery missions after injury.
"I would say probably now, besides Roger and Rafa, he's the best," Thiem said. "You just need to look at his results."
Ranked third in the world, Zverev is yet to transfer his talent and success in Masters events to Grand Slams, however, where his best result remains reaching the fourth round at Wimbledon last year.
On this evidence, that breakthrough is surely close, with the crowd on Manolo Santana court treated to an impressive display of aggressive baseline hitting. Thiem's 21 errors to Zverev's 12 were also key.
"Rafa is the favourite, no matter where he plays, on a clay court," Zverev said. "He's going to be the favourite in Rome, he's going to be the favourite in Paris. He's still the guy to beat."
The players in Madrid this week have remarked on the quickness of the courts and that has suited Zverev, whose demon serve was almost untouchable in the opening set.
After conceding an early break for 2-0, Thiem's only sniff came at 5-4 when he opened up 0-30 on the Zverev serve. But his opponent did not waver, letting out a roar of relief after clinching the frame.
Another break in the first game of the second meant Thiem was again playing catch-up and Zverev could have moved 3-0 clear had Thiem not saved two more break points. Instead, Thiem stayed in touch to make Zverev serve out. A sumptuous half-volley opened up two match points and Zverev took the first when a final Thiem forehand floated long.
"It's a great feeling," Zverev said. "Hopefully this will not be my last, hopefully I can continue to improve, and win a few more." AFP

It is imperative that we continue with the Executive Presidency for the national unity. the Minister stressed. The powers vested with the Executive President were reduced by the 19th Amendment, and I believe they should be reduced further, he said.
He said it was the responsibility of the government to provide solutions to peoples issues to prevent them from appealing to international organizations and other countries.
I do not approve of our people appealing to foreign nations and international organizations to resolve internal issues of our nation.
They have no other option if the government is unable to address their issues, the Minister said. Every Sri Lankan must be conversant in Sinhala and Tamil for them to settle issues as one nation, he said.

One million people in Sri Lanka suffer from asthma
Sri Lanka has about one million estimated asthma patients and each year 1,000 of them succumb to the disease, Colombo National Hospital Senior Consultant and Respiratory Physician Dr. Kirthi Gunasekara said.
Sri Lanka has a higher number of asthma patients when it is compared with the number of asthma patients in other countries. Over 20 percent of children suffer from asthma. Of them, 12 percent are in a critical state. Over 20 percent of adults suffer from the disease.
He was addressing a  press briefing held at the Information Department, Colombo yesterday to mark the World Asthma Day.
The theme of this years World Asthma Day was A clean atmosphere, a clean environment and an end to the asthma disease. A panel of experts gave views on the statistics, symptoms, causes and medication related to the disease.
Dr. Gunasekara said the government should be more aware of the statistics and should work to mitigate the long-term disease through awareness programmes and researches.
Asthma occurs as an inflammation of the respiratory tract. When the respiratory tract is more sensitive, the smooth muscles get tighter and the wall of the respiratory tract becomes thicker. When this happens, the area allocated for the flow of air is reduced and breathing diseases occur, Consultant Respiratory Physician, Welisara National Hospital Dr. Suharshi De Silva said. She said symptoms of asthma include short of breath, noises while breathing and a dry cough during cold nights. Air pollution, irritants in atmosphere, smoke emitted from vehicles, dust, pets, cigarettes and dust mites are some of the common causes of asthma. But causes differ from person to person, she said.
Consultant Respiratory Physician and Senior Lecturer, University of Sri Jayawardenepura Dr. Chandimani Undugodage said medications could be given as per the symptoms of the patient. Asthma can be controlled more effectively by using inhalers. Inhalers include relievers and preventers. The reliever inhaler should be used as soon as the symptoms are visible, while the preventer inhaler should be used daily as a long-term solution to reduce asthma, she said.
We are enhancing awareness among the citizens about the disease. A walk will take place on June 5 in Kandy to mark the World Environment Day and they could undergo free lung examinations in the Kandy City Centre, Consultant Respiratory Physician, Hambantota District General Hospital Dr. Bodhika Samarasekara said.

President, undisputed leader of all communities Lakinda Nanayakkara
There is a strong possibility for the two main parties to form a broad coalition and field President Maithripala Sirisena as a candidate for the 2020 Presidential election too, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva said.
He made this comment in response to several questions raised by journalists when he arrived in Ambalangoda to attend the Ambalangoda Regional Co-ordinating meeting held on May 14.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena was the undisputed leader acceptable to all communities. Both the SLFP and the country as a whole had received a rejuvenation with the Presidents announcement that he had no desire to go on retirement in 2020.
The Chief Minister said the Joint Opposition which considered the SLFP coalition with the UNP as a sinful act had strangely coalesced with the UNP to set up administration in several local councils.
The SLFP was a party set up by the late Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike at a very auspicious time and no one would be able to destroy it as it would last for ever, he said.
Temporary electoral setbacks were a natural phenomenon experienced by any political party. But public opinion in Sri Lanka was liable to change at various times. Some people who voted against Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2015 voted for his party in 2018. As such, no one could predict that the SLPP would secure the same number of votes at a future election.
At the recently concluded local elections, the SLPP received only 40 percent of the total votes. This meant that 60 percent of votes had been cast against it, he pointed out.

He said the recruitment reflects the democracy of the Good Governance Government since they were recruited via a test. He said 65,000 persons faced the test.
The Minister said these youth were lucky because 47,000 unemployed graduates were awaiting employment opportunities. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Minister Daya Gamage were present.

50 Greatest Players in World Cup History
#45 Lionel Messi
One-hundred and twenty-two minutes on the clock and Argentina have a free-kick about 35 yards from goal. The little magician had just seen his team fall behind in the final of the FIFA World Cup in 2014 thanks to an inspired substitution by Joachim Low. Mario Gotze, Germanys saviour.
Everyone watched on with bated breath, waiting for Leo Messi to curl the ball into the top right corner, past the despairing dive of Manuel Neuer.
Up stepped the Barcelona man, the trademark stutter followed, that trade-mark finish never did. Another goal on top of the original wouldnt have been enough to hand Argentina a life-line.
The closest that Lionel Messi had ever come to lifting the holy grail of world football, probably the hardest night in his illustrious career. The Argentine has taken everything football has thrown at him, but glory in the most significant cup competition in the world of the sport still eludes the diminutive magician.
Even in his darkest hour, Lionel Messis class shone through as he walked away with the Golden Ball, thanks to his 4 goals in the campaign in Brazil. But were certain it made little difference to arguably the greatest player of his generation, the trophy that mattered the world to him was in the other dressing room.
His first goal in the competition came as an 18-year old against a hapless Serbia and Montenegro side that leaked six against the South Americans. The World Cup in 2010 was less ominous, as far as goal-scoring is concerned, but that doesnt mean Messi failed to leave an imprint on the tournament. Four assists in the group stage, before getting thrashed out of the competition at the hands of an irresistible German side.
The most auspicious tournament for the leading goal-scorer for Argentina came in the latest edition of the World Cup in Brazil. Argentina toiled their way past the group stages with one-goal wins against relative minnows Bosnia Herzegovina, Iran and Nigeria. Messi did all his scoring in these three matches including a brace against Nigeria to send his side through to the knock-out stage.
The round of sixteen shouldve been a walk in the park as they were faced with having to overcome a relatively weaker Swiss side. They needed extra-time and an assist from their talisman to get past them, with Angel di Maria finding the back of the net in the 118th minute.
Belgium were dealt with in the quarters thanks to an early goal from Gonzalo Higuain before needing penalties to move into the finals, after a tight goalless 120 minutes against the Dutch in the semi-finals. Messi stepped up to take the first penalty, sent the keeper the wrong way and the ball the other. Never a moments doubt.
The heart-ache that followed in the final will probably never subside unless Leo Messi and co. plan a coup of sorts in the tournament in Russia in about a couple of months time. Argentina are relative outsiders in the race for the World Cup 2018, as Brazil and Germany are heavy favourites with the bookmakers to go all the way.
Having almost single-handedly dragged Los Gauchos into the final 32 with a hat-trick in the crucial final qualifier against Ecuador, we will reserve our judgement regarding the prospects of the Argentine National football team till the final whistle of the tournament.
An ageing squad and new management, to say nothing of the hammering at the hands of Spain in a recent friendly, few can say definitively whether Leo Messi will have another crack at winning the only silverware, team or individual, that he hasnt been able to lay his hands on.
With the debate of the greatest footballer of all time still hinged on whether the little man can lift the most significant trophy in the game, we reckon Leo will come out all guns blazing in Russia considering it might be his last tournament in the blue and white for Argentina.
Irrespective of the outcome, we reckon the five-time Ballon dOr winner is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of our 50 Greatest players in World Cup history.  sk

Amir injury concerns Pakistan
DUBLIN, Sunday: Bowling coach Azhar Mahmood admitted Pakistan were "concerned" by Mohammad Amir's early exit from the third day's play against Ireland at Malahide just over a week before the start of a Test series with England.
Left-arm quick Amir went off with what Mahmood said was a recurrence of a "chronic" left knee injury after a brief spell in Test debutants Ireland's second innings after Pakistan enforced the follow-on on Sunday.
It was a frustrating end to the day for Amir, with the 25-year-old having both Ed Joyce (39 not out) and captain William Porterfield (23 not out) dropped off his bowling in that 3.2 over burst before the openers took Ireland to 64 without loss at the close -- still 116 runs behind Pakistan's 310 for nine declared.
The first Test against England gets underway at Lord's on May 24.
It was also at Lord's where the now 26-year-old Amir's cricket career almost came to an end following his involvement in a spot-fixing scandal during a 2010 Test against England.
Amir was given a jail sentence by an English court and a five-year ban by the International Cricket Council. He made his return to the world stage two years ago, with Mahmood suggesting Amir's lengthy time away from the game allied to the fact he had been involved in all three international formats -- Tests, one-dayers and Twenty20s -- since coming back had taken a toll on Amir, who last season helped Essex win English cricket's first-class County Championship.
"Unfortunately, he came back after five years (out) and since he came back he has played every format for us," said Mahmood, himself a former Pakistan pace bowling all-rounder.
"We have to manage his workload as well so maybe that's a sign for us to in the future to see where he stands.
"We are working on that, and hopefully we can come up with something."
Meanwhile Mahmood was clear Pakistan did not want Amir, who has taken 95 wickets in 30 matches before this match, concentrating solely on limited-overs cricket as a fitness measure.
We want him to play Test cricket because he's our number one bowler and we want him to run in and bowl for us so if workload -- I have seen a lot of bowlers and their bodies can't take it, so they just manage to play one format or two formats,explained Mahmood, who starred in county cricket for both Surrey and Kent.

Amunugama asked to appear at TID for statement
Joint Opposition (JO) MP Dilum Amunugama has been asked to appear at the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) today to give a statement regarding the recent Kandy violence.
MP Amunugama speaking to Daily News said the government and the Police were unable to control the violence that took place in Kandy and are now trying to find the scapegoats. When theses violent incidents occurred, there were no police and the political authority in the area.
The riot was came to end because we intervened between the two parties and settled the matter through discussions. The violence was intensified after police arrested 14 Sinhalese alleging that they had set fire to the shop belonging to a Muslim person, he said.
Wrong actions and incapability of the Police has resulted in intensifying the situation. Several Muslim Ministers have told me that they are willing to support me by even giving evidence on my involvement of sorting out the problem. But it is oblivious the government is trying to cover up its inability to stop the violent disturbances by finding faults with the Opposition members, he said.

Another family behind latest Indonesia suicide bombings
INDONESIA: A family of five, including a child, carried out the suicide bombing of a police headquarters in Indonesias second city Surabaya on Monday, police said, a day after a deadly wave of attacks on churches staged by another family.
The spate of bombings has rocked Indonesia, with the Islamic State group claiming the church attacks and raising fears about its influence in Southeast Asia as its dreams of a Middle Eastern caliphate fizzle.
Indonesia has long struggled with Islamist militancy, including the 2002 Bali bombings that killed over 200 people -- mostly foreign tourists -- in the countrys worst-ever terror attack.
Security forces have arrested hundreds of militants during a sustained crackdown that smashed some networks, and most recent attacks have been low-level and targeted domestic security force.
But that changed Sunday as a family of six -- including two young girls -- staged suicide bombings of churches during morning services in the countrys second biggest city Surabaya, killing 14.
On Monday, members of another family attacked the police station in Surabaya, wounding 10.
There were five people on two motorbikes. One of them was a little kid, national police chief Tito Karnavian said. This is one family. An eight-year-old girl from the family survived the attack and was taken to hospital, while her mother, father and two brothers died in the blast, he said.
The church attacks were claimed by the Islamic State group.
The father of the church suicide bombers was a local leader in extremist network Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) which supports IS.
It ordered and gave instructions for its cells to make a move, Karnavian said of the church attacks.
He added that the attacks may have also been motivated by the arrest of JAD leadership, including jailed radical Aman Abdurrahman, and were linked to a deadly prison riot staged by Islamist prisoners at a high-security jail near Jakarta last week.
Abdurrahman has been connected to several deadly incidents, including a 2016 gun and suicide attack in the capital Jakarta that left four attackers and four civilians dead.
Despite their apparent allegiance to IS, the church-bombing family were not returnees from Syria, police said Monday, correcting their earlier statements.
However, hundreds of Indonesians have flocked in recent years to fight alongside IS in its bid to carve out a caliphate ruled by strict Islamic law.
Its efforts have been fizzling quickly as it has lost most of the land it once occupied in Iraq and Syria.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the church bombings, a further three people in another family were killed and two wounded when another bomb exploded at an apartment complex about 30 kilometres (20 miles) from Surabaya.
Police said the father in the church bombings -- Dita Oepriyanto -- was a confidante of the man killed in the apartment, who police said had a bomb detonator in his hand when he was shot by authorities.
The father was Ditas close friend, said Karnavian, the police chief.
When we searched the flat we found pipe bombs, similar to pipe bombs we found near the churches. Indonesian police have foiled numerous terror plots, but the coordinated nature of Sundays church bombings and the subsequent blasts point to more sophisticated planning than in the past, analysts said. - AFP

Beyond The Clouds
Beautiful but obnoxious
The rustic settings of Marc Forsters The Kite Runner based on Khaled Hosseinis renowned novel of the same name comes to mind when you go through the first few scenes of Iranian director Majid Majidis Beyond the Clouds.
However the similarities end there as we find an entirely new story with a novel plot unfolding in the picture. We meet Amir, a youth who makes hard earned cash by smuggling drugs and transporting them on motorbike. In one such assignment he meets with a spot of bother as police breaks into their hideaway. Amir rescues one of his colleagues from the clutches of the police and makes off with them hot on his heels. Finally it is Amirs estranged sister who comes to his rescue as she and one of her acquaintances at the market, Akshi hides him under a bundle of clothes till the cops pass out of sight.
Later Akshi wants the favour returned and makes sexual advances on Tara. She hits out at him, badly injuring him in the struggle. While he is bundled off to hospital Tara is awaiting trial for attempted murder. Amir works hard to keep Akshi alive so that he can admit to his crime and set Tara free. Meantime he also becomes an involuntary guardian to Akshis two daughters and his mother.
Thus the two lives of the brother and sister run parallel to each other in two settings. Though the scenes look grim on the outside we do find a couple of touching episodes in each of these environs. For example while Tara becomes the surrogate mother to a motherless child in prison, Amir bonds with Akshis daughters despite trying to sell the 10-year-old to a sex trafficker.
The beauty in Majidis production lies in how even the tiniest kind gesture gives an enormous tug to your heartstrings. The drawback mostly lies on trying to crowd too much of the social issues related to drug dealing youth onto one characters shoulders. Not only does Amir have to deal with having to keep Akshi alive, look after his family and earn cash the immoral way but he also has to play a cat and mouse game when friends turn to foes.
Centering on the themes of good vs evil the film colours the Indian setting vividly, contrasting them with the moods of the characters in browns, grays and blacks. It also highlights many facets of rural India.
The actors too do full justice to their roles. Ishaan Khattar makes a very convincing Amir while Malavika Mohanan gives a commendable performance as Tara. The rest of the characters  even the most minute ones  play their parts well.
Heartwarming in one minute while becoming heavy handed the next second, Beyond the Clouds steps well ahead of many of the melodramas made today.

Boost for Lanka-Iran ties
Iran and Sri Lanka have enjoyed strong bilateral ties for nearly six decades, but the links go back centuries into the past. Persian traders were known to visit Sri Lanka and some of them even settled down here, charmed by the beauty of our resplendent isle. In more modern times, the two countries have strengthened mutual cooperation and trade.
In this context, President Maithripala Sirisenas current visit to Iran assumes great significance. Many, if not all, Sri Lankan leaders have visited Tehran, reaffirming the bonds between the two friendly countries. The two are also among the first members of the Non-Aligned Movement. Iran has always supported Sri Lanka at international forums. After the conflict, when there was a lot of pressure on Sri Lanka on Human Rights issues, Iran was supportive of Sri Lanka throughout.
Iran has always been a major trading partner, buying the bulk of Ceylon Tea, which is the most popular brew in the country. Iranians prefer to drink only Ceylon Tea and generally do not consume teas produced in other countries. Sri Lanka has been a traditional buyer of Iranian crude oil and petroleum products. Iran was the sole supplier for the countrys only refinery for several decades. Iran is also one of the biggest aid donors to Sri Lanka and President Sirisena has urged more Iranian companies to invest in Sri Lanka in diverse fields.
Trade between the two nations was affected by the sanctions imposed against Iran by sections of the International Community over the nuclear issue. Although some sanctions were lifted following the signing of a landmark nuclear deal between Iran and six other major powers in 2015, the recent withdrawal of the US from the deal (the other major signatories still remain committed to it) may have an impact on Irans trade activities with other countries. Emerging economies such as Sri Lanka should seek ways and means to ensure that trade can be carried out at least to some extent in such an eventuality.
The bilateral talks between President Hassan Rouhani and President Sirisena in Tehran are even more important in the present situation. They had discussed the expansion of economic and trade ties between the two sides. President Rouhani noted that the talks with President Sirisena focused on the sale of Iranian crude oil, petrochemicals, building blocks, as well as technical and engineering services.
The five Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) signed in the presence of the two countries presidents in Tehran will increase bilateral cooperation in different fields. The MoUs cover the fight against drug trafficking, cooperation in health, medical science, medicine and medical equipment, cooperation on standardization, training and laboratory services, collaboration in the film industry between the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance of Iran and the National Film Corporation of Sri Lanka and cooperation in cultural, scientific and educational fields. Two of the MoUs stand out in particular - it is heartening to see countries such as Iran and Sri Lanka join hands to fight the scourge of illegal narcotics that are routed through the region and there are many lessons we can draw from Irans vibrant film industry. In fact, the 2017 Oscar for Best Foreign Language movie went to Iran, for Asghar Farhadis The Salesman.
The two leaders have also focused another vital matter  the lack of a direct scheduled air link between Colombo and Tehran (Irans Mahan Air offers only charter flights). Although nine millions Iranians travel abroad every year, Sri Lanka gets only a few thousand of them. If a direct air link can be established along with a major promotional campaign on Sri Lanka, more Iranian tourists are likely to visit. Both Iran Air and SriLankan Airlines must explore the possibility of starting such a direct flight, while also leaving the door open for privately owned Iranian low cost carriers to fly to Colombo. It will also be a boost for two-way business travel and air freight. Tehran will also be a gateway for Lankan travellers heading to other destinations in the region and Iranian flying to Colombo will have easy access to India and other regional destinations as well.
Sri Lanka should also seek Iranian expertise for oil exploration. This is very much a long term process, but striking oil will help reduce the countrys massive fuel import bill. On a more immediate note, updating the existing refinery with Iranian help would help Sri Lanka to import more crude oil and reduce imports of finished products such as petrol and diesel, which are generally more expensive to purchase in the world market. Iran can also offer its expertise in power generation, renewable energy and the motor car industry, being the 18th largest vehicle manufacturer in the world. There will be plenty of demand in Sri Lanka for an attractively priced family car manufactured by Iran, which already exports vehicles to markets around the globe. We hope President Sirisenas visit will lay a firm foundation for all these measures and more, signifying a new chapter in the ties between the two countries.

He is currently being treated in the ICU. The body of the deceased person is currently lying at the Colombo National Hospital Mortuary pending the postmortem examination, which is scheduled to take place after the relatives of the deceased arrives in Sri Lanka.
The Police Media Spokesman said the cause of death cannot be determined until the postmortem examination is held. Colombo Fort Police are conducting further investigations.

Gulf tensions rise after Iran nuke deal crisis
Can U.S. alone curb Iran
Even as Malaysias original political strongman returns to his countrys helm in a shock overthrow of his own original governing party, the Persian Gulf region is transfixed over Israels dangerous military brinkmanship after United States exited the 2015 Iran nuclear arms limitation pact. And the rest of the world braces for the impact of new US political and economic sanctions against Iran, a battered, but proud, ancient West Asian power.
Malaysias triumphant return of its greatest modern political leader Mahathir Mohamed is likely to open a new chapter in that countrys progress as a rising economic powerhouse. But pleasant surprise of his political return at age 92 years, is temporarily eclipsed on the world stage by the United States latest move against Iran.
On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump, paused in his frantic manoeuvres to evade probes on foreign subversion conspiracy and, possibly criminal, sexual intrigue, to announce the US unilateral exit from the Iran nuclear pact. The pact, namely, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was signed in the Austrian capital of Vienna in 2015 after several years of controversial, but intense, Western pressure through harsh sanctions followed by complex negotiations between Iran and the worlds dominant powers including the US, China, Russia and the EU.
In his brief Tuesday announcement, the US President said that by August and November this year, the United States would systematically re-introduce a sweeping sanctions regime against Iran. While formally announcing the US withdrawal from JCPOA 2015, Trump seemed to leave the door open for a possible reversal of the US decision by stating that the remaining signatories of JCPOA 2015 could try to re-formulate the pact by making it even more restrictive on Iran in line with US demands.
His time table of a just the next few months is wholly unrealistic given the years it has taken for the existing pact to be finalised  as is normal with any multi-lateral geo-political agreement. Indeed, the US announcement is so cursorily formulated with virtually no indication of any US role in such re-negotiations, that the world community is given the impression that Washington is uninterested in any re-negotiation in the near future but would rather try to browbeat Tehran by brute force.
The lack of any real effort by the US to present its new negotiating position and propose a possible bargaining process to achieve a new pact only gives the impression that Washington is more interested in using sanctions in order to merely cripple Irans viability as a state and regional power.
Anti-Tehran rhetoric
Even if the White House has not expressly stated this objective of crude geo-political emasculation, the failure of the US leader or his Administration to offer a diplomatic and political alternative to the existing JCPOA starkly betrays Washingtons real motive. In fact, many right-wing US opinion leaders have made it very clear in their barrage of anti-Tehran rhetoric that Washington should move against Iran anyway in order to blunt that countrys growing influence in West Asia.
The fact that the US has seemingly left it to the rest of the JCPOA 2015 signatories, albeit the worlds most powerful states, to try to re-negotiate the JCPOA, also reveals something more than merely Washingtons underlying motive of undermining Iran as a powerful state. The failure of the US to take the lead in such re-negotiation reveals, once more, the growing geo-political ineptness of this one-time superpower builder and designer of the world system as it is today.
The very crudity of Washingtons motive in undermining Irans stature as a nation on the one hand has immediately worsened inter-state tensions in the whole West Asian region. Only the two most repressive states in West Asia, namely Israel and Saudi Arabia, Americas closest allies in the region, have positively reacted to the US JCPOA exit. Those two states are Irans bitterest enemies.
Tel Aviv, having tamed the Saudis with US help, and bullied some of its immediate Muslim-Arab neighbours into temporary acceptance of Palestines Zionist occupation, is anxious to neutralise a stubborn Syria and wants to stem Irans support for the Assad regime in Damascus. Tel Aviv simply cannot stand Irans growing influence in the region especially after the Wests regime change exercise in Iraq resulted in the Shia majority community gaining political dominance in Baghdad.
A civilisation that, by the middle Bronze Age, was building the worlds largest empire of the time, Iran is today newly powerful not only because of ancient regional stature. An evolving experiment in indigenous republican democracy, Iran is a growing economic power based on a large domestic market, a high degree of social development and political stability, modern industrial and agricultural sectors and, its fossil fuel wealth.
After decades of a hostile border with the Saddam Hussein-led and Sunni dominated dictatorship in Iraq, Tehran, is today reaping the benefits of this new partnership between the original Shia semi-theocratic state of the region and its new Shia-led neighbour. Both countries are among the worlds richest in fossil fuel resources as well as socially developed, and could easily emerge as the most powerful states in West Asia with their sizeable populations and military potential.
If Tel Aviv does not like new rival powers, neither does the core Sunni state of monarchist Saudi Arabia. Tel Aviv has its own  undeclared  nuclear military deterrent capacity as well as the guarantee of an American military-economic umbrella, but still wants to stamp out any other regional power that threatens its current military dominance. Saudi Arabia is rich in oil but is dominated by a dictatorial Sunni monarchy with a fragile hold over a relatively tiny population which has a significant Shia minority. Hence Riyadh feels a mounting insecurity as Iran prospers and stabilizes.
Hence, both Tel Aviv and Riyadh have a common enemy in Tehran and all they want is a greatly weakened one with or without nuclear weapons.
Already, Israel has  without official acknowledgment  launched several airstrikes in recent weeks targeting Iranian paramilitary units currently supporting the besieged secular dictatorship in Syria against the US and Saudi-backed rebel insurgency. The Western-backed Syrian rebellion still includes powerful elements of originally Saudi-nurtured Islamist totalitarian groups such as Al-Nusra, Al-Qeada and the Daesh (or Islamic State of Iraq & Levant/ISIL).
Israeli air strikes
Last week, after several such Israeli air strikes against Iranianian-supported paramilitaries in Syria, some Iranian client paramilitaries launched an unsuccessful rocket attack on the Israeli forces on the Golan Heights border highlands of Syria that Tel Aviv invaded and occupied in 1967. That prompted a further wave of powerful Israeli air attacks that reportedly destroyed and damaged other Iranian assets such as an arms dump and troop quarters.
There are indications that Washingtons reversal of its Iran policy into a more hostile one, could encourage Israel to go further in its own moves to keep possible regional rivals weak and divided. It is possible that Tel Aviv is banking on the continued ineptness of the current Washington administration and the domestic distractions hindering the White House policy and strategy refinement.
The fact is that a self-centred ruling Republican Party is momentarily sustaining their incompetent President in power for their short term electoral success. This only helps all those other states who want to misguide the worlds sole (but stumbling) superpower into foreign relations misadventures that would mask their own geo-political projects.
The difference in todays world as compared with the situation a decade ago is that not only is the Iran nuclear pact still backed by its other signatories, but also that all those signatories have a combined political, economic and military-strategic clout that matches the worlds sole superpower. Russia is not dependent on the US economically and can easily afford to sustain its ties with Iran. China, while relying heavily on trade with the US also knows that the US also relies heavily on that vast Chinese market and, hence, cannot retaliate drastically if Beijing continues business with Tehran.
The EU, though is caught because its reliance on trade as well as politico-military ties with the US does not allow it to defy US anti-Iran sanctions the way Moscow and Beijing can.
Nevertheless, the world scenario is such today, that the US may want to strike out on its own unique strategy against Iran, but whether it has the capacity to coerce the rest of the world to go along with it is a (new) big question. That may be why Donald Trump left the door open for a future policy reversal.

[CITIZENS' Mail - (15-05-2018)]
THE QUESTION OF AFTERLIFE
Dr. Asoka Thenuwara, in reply to my letter of May 7, offers an opinion: Buddhism stresses the utmost urgency in terminating the rebirth process [afterlife] here and now. He continues with a query: For me the question of afterlife is irrelevant and has devoted my entire life for full-time meditation for the single purpose of ending of Samsara [continuation of life] here and now because there is no choice.
I cannot understand when he says afterlife is irrelevant and at the same time speaks of Samsara  continuation of life. Surely rebirth and Samsara are interconnected as there cannot be a Samsara without a rebirth to tread the journey. Samsara.
Having said that, I still maintain Heaven, Nirvana and Hell are imaginary places meant to discipline, drill fear into people. We have been taught that those who do good or meritorious acts go to heaven and those who do evil would go to hell or be born again to continue life on Samsara till reaching eternal bliss, the end of rebirth. Buddhism brings in another fear or reward in rebirth and Samsara.
Here is a hypothetical case which came to my mind while writing this letter. Queen Elizabeth is the Head of State of United Kingdom. According to those who believe in rebirth, she may have performed meritorious acts in her previous births in Samsara to be born as a queen and live in luxury with pomp and glory. Then why was she born to be the head of the Church of England a branch of Christianity, which beliefs in God the Creator and not what is preached in Buddhism  Karma
As I always said and maintain, man is born, endowed with seven senses: mouth to taste and speak, eyes to see, nose to smell, ears to hear, hands to touch and feel, legs to walk and move and mind to think and decide. Use these nature-given gifts to the full and not be a nuisance to the society and the environment you live and pass off with a feeling of happiness and contentment with no regrets, to whatever place if there is any. In short, why worry over some things which are unknown and chain yourself
Today, all these religious, fables, tales and beliefs, rites and rituals have been classified as mythology, fictional stories that give the intelligent men some entertainment as to how our ancestors have been misled or fooled. We are now intellectually-evolved technologically-skilled people and science attempts to find physical proof for that which is unknown or not yet defined and to reject superstition and misperception in favour of observable facts. When science offers an answer, that answer is universal and we accept.
As Dan Brown, the researcher, in his book Origin states The age of religion is drawing to a close and the age of science is drawing.
Let me wind up with a saying of that greatest philosopher, the Buddha:
Do no evil, perform meritorious acts, purify your mind and such is the advice of the Buddhas.
The Buddha, in his final advice, has not spoken of heaven, hell, rebirth or samsara, but how to live this life.

Country recorded highest FDI, exports in 2017 - PM
Sri Lanka recorded its highest Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) of USD 1900 million in 2017, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.
This was in addition to the investment made to the Hambantota harbour. The countrys highest exports was also recorded in the same year, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said that more investment is expected this year with even higher Foreign Direct Investment and exports by 2020.
This would boost development in the country, the Premier said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe made these observations at a ceremony held to present appointment letters to 4,511 recruits to the Public Management Assistant Service.
The Prime Minister further said that since the conflict ended in 2009, the country has reached a standard where youth could be recruited to the public service.
He added in addition, the Good Governance government has created stability that has resulted in a condusive atmosphere where youth can be recruited to the public service, the setting up of Free Trade Zones, Tourist Zones and training youth through Yowun Senankaya to create employment opportunities.
The government had to take two years to get rid of the burden of loans, the Premier said. He also said when the Good Governance government was elected, the countrys economy was in a precarious position and we were unable to settle the colossal loans obrained by the previous regime.
We have plans to create three more Free Trade Zones In Bingiriya, Kalutara and Weligama apart from the Hambantota Free Trade Zone, the Prime Minister said. Between 1978 to 1992, only three Free Trade Zones were developed. But now, we have been able to construct four within the past two years. In addition, we plan to set up three Tourist Zones, the Premier added.
The Prime Minister also stated that the salaries of the Public Management Assistant Service would be increased on par with those of the private sector employees. He also said that the youth would be recruited to the public service, private sector job creation expanded, self employment projects promoted and a development bank set up to provide capital to the large scale businesses. The Prime Minister said the the Public Management Assistant Service acts as a mediator between the government and the public to implement these policies and develop the country allowing the people to enjoy the dividends of development.

Creepily realistic porcelain dolls
Dolls might be seen as toys, but in the right hands they can become enchanting art. Russian jeweler artist and designer Marina Bychkova, who lives in Canada, creates stunning one-of-a-kind ball-jointed porcelain dolls for adults.
Marina says that her calling for creating dolls became evident back when she was only six. She couldnt stand how boring and mediocre the mass-produced dolls were, so Marina started making toys that suited her own ideas of beauty. Eventually, the training at the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design influenced her to commit to the doll making as a career.
According to the creator, she named the brand after Paul Gallicos short story called Enchanted Doll. Fiction reflects in most of her works, as Marina recreates such well-known characters as Cinderella and Little Red Riding Hood.
The dolls are meticulously made using high quality materials, such as porcelain, gold, silver, and even Swarovski crystals. They help to achieve uniqueness and sophisticated beauty. Depicting sensuality and delicacy, these dolls will enchant anyone who lays eyes on them.

A demonstration was staged by the residents of Vantharumoolai in the Eravur Pattu Chenkalady secretarial area to make people aware of the negative effects of micro credit facilities in the Batticaloa district.
The demonstration took place from Ammalathadi Pillaiyar Temple up to the Chenkalady market and back to the starting point on Saturday.
By now, recipients of 17 micro credit facilities have committed suicide while families have broken up and recipients were subjected to severe mental and social ills, the demonstrators allege. People who are receiving micro credit facilities are in desperate financial straits. Therefore, they jump at the idea of obtaining micro credit loans but suffer immensely in repaying it daily, weekly or monthly.
Demonstrators requested Batticaloa District Parliamentarian S. Viyalendran and former Eastern Province Agriculture Minister S. Viyalendran to look into the issues.

Digital Transformation to contribute over US$ 1 trillion to Asia GDP
By 2021, digital transformation will add an estimated USD 1.16 trillion to Asia Pacifics GDP, and increase the growth rate by 0.8% annually, according to a new business study released recently. The research, entitled Unlocking the Economic Impact of Digital Transformation in Asia Pacific , was produced by Microsoft in partnership with IDC Asia/Pacific.
The study predicts a dramatic acceleration in the pace of digital transformation across Asias economies. In 2017, about 6% of the regions GDP was derived from digital products and services created directly through the use of digital technologies, such as mobility, cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This is expected to surge to around 60% of Asia GDP by 2021.
The survey conducted with 1,560 business decision makers in mid and large-sized organizations across 15 economies in the region highlights the rapid impact and widespread disruption that digital transformation is having on traditional business models.
Respondents to the study identified five key benefits to their bottom line from digital transformation:
According to the research findings, business leaders are already seeing 15% to 17% improvements across these benefits from their efforts today, and they expect to see more than 50% improvements in those key areas by 2020, with the biggest jump expected in customer advocacy.
Digital transformation has a positive and measurable impact on Asia Pacifics economy, and it is widely regarded that every organization needs to be a digital one, said Ralph Haupter, President, Microsoft Asia. In fact, customers that we are speaking to are increasingly deploying emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence as part of their digital transformation initiatives, and that will accelerate growth even further.
Digital Leaders in Asia Pacific to Gain Lions Share
While 84% of organizations in the region are in the midst of their digital transformation journey, only 7% can be classified as Leaders. These are organizations that have full or progressing digital transformation strategies, with at least a third of their revenue from digital products and services. In addition, these companies are seeing between 20 - 30% improvements in benefits across various business areas from their initiatives.
The Study indicates that Leaders experience double the benefits of followers, and these improvements will be more pronounced by 2020. Almost half of Leaders (48%) have a full digital transformation strategy in place.
The pace of DX is accelerating, and IDC expect that by 2021, at least 60% of Asia/Pacific GDP will be digitalized, with growth in every industry driven by digitally-enhanced offerings, operations and relationships. The study shows leaders seeing double the benefits of followers, with improvements in productivity, cost reductions, and customer advocacy. To remain competitive, organizations must establish new metrics, realign organization structures, and rearchitect their technology platform, said Daniel-Zoe Jimenez, Research Director Digital Transformation Practice Lead, IDC Asia/Pacific.
Winners will take all in the digital transformation race, and thus it is crucial for organizations to adopt a Leaders mindset when approaching digital transformation initiatives. To do so, organizations need to build up their ecosystem  from employees, to customers, to partners  in order to grow their value chain by gaining new insights through new data sources, expanding their digital products and services, and ultimately growing their data as a capital asset, said Haupter.
Microsoft is uniquely positioned to help organizations in Asia to succeed in their digital transformation journeys today through our agile platforms and solutions that prioritize flexibility, integration and trust. As an organization that has also undergone digital transformation, we understand what organizations will need to make their journeys a successful one.
Digital Transformation will Benefit Citizens
According to the business leaders surveyed, digital transformation will bring about these top three benefits to society:
1. Smarter, safer and moreefficient cities
2. Creation of more higher value jobs
3. Potential incrementto personal income through freelance and digital work
In addition, 85% of respondents felt that jobs will be transformed in the next three years due to digital transformation, and half of the jobs in market today will redeployed to higher value roles, or reskilled to meet the need of the digital age.
The rise of digital transformation in Asia Pacific economies will affect the labour market where many types of jobs will evolve and change. In past industrial revolutions, workers were reskilled to deliver higher value output to meet increased market demands, resulting in jobs transformation. What is encouraging is that two thirds of respondents are confident that their young employees already have future ready skills that will help them to transition to new roles, said Haupter.
There is also concern about displacement of jobs due to digital transformation. The Study, however, found that digital transformation will not reduce the number of jobs. According to business leaders, 26% of new jobs will be created from digital transformation, which is about the same number of jobs that will be automated, or about 27%; in other words, the effect will be neutral.
Despite the impact being mitigated, governments and organizations should still focus on reskilling, upskilling and continuous learning will be important in ensure successful workforce transformation for the digital age.
Riding the Wave of Digital Transformation
Organizations in Asia Pacific need to accelerate their digital transformation journey to reap full benefits of their initiatives, and to address the invisible revolution brought about the mass adoption of AI. More importantly, companies need to focus on capitalizing their own data in order to gain new market insights, create new digital products and services, and monetize data through data sharing securely, and in collaboration with its ecosystem. Microsoft recommends organizations strategies to create a digital culture, build an information ecosystem and embrace micro-revolutions become a digital transformation leader.
It also recommends developing future ready skills for individuals and organizations. Organizations today must relook at training and reskilling its workforce so that workers are equipped with future ready skill sets such as complex problem solving, critical thinking and creativity for the digital economy.
More importantly, they need to rebalance the workforce to attain and attract key digital talents, as well as be open in creating a flexible worksource model where they tap into skills-based marketplace.

Dropped country tracks from new album
Kylie Minogue ditched certain songs from her new album as they sounded too country.
Golden is Kylie's latest offering and marks the Australian singer's 14th studio album. While she's kept to her pop roots, Kylie has added a country edge to the songs, though the 49-year-old admits she went overboard on some of the tracks she recorded while in Nashville, Tennessee.
"We did some songs in Nashville that were a step too far for me," she laughed to Vogue Australia, adding they sounded great in Tennessee, but once she got back "into my real world" they were a step too country.
She added: "I've learnt a lot about songwriting... having two weeks in Nashville, that changed so much for me." Tennessee is the home state of country legend Dolly Parton, who happens to be one of Kylie's biggest heroes. So while she was in the U.S. state, the petite popstar made sure she soaked up all things Dolly-related. Rolling Stone

Eyes speak  louder then words!
A woman trapped in her own body after suffering a stroke has written a book about her ordeal using only her eyes.
29-year-old Mia Austin was left unable to speak and can now only communicate through eye movement and a spelling chart after having a stroke when she was just 21 years old.
After the stroke, Mia was diagnosed with an extremely rare condition known as locked in syndrome, with doctors describing the condition as the closest thing to being buried alive.
Mia, from Wirral, North West., is paralysed from the neck down and has to be fed through a tube. As she is unable to speak, Mia uses a special computer to communicate, which recognises her eye gaze.
In her book In the blink of an eye, which was launched on April 27, Mia shares her experiences of her ordeal with readers.
In the introduction, Mia writes, I must have woken on the morning of November 16, 2009, totally oblivious as to what was going to happen because Id been to work, as usual, nothing different, followed by the gym where I did my normal workout. I went straight in to tell my mum how badly Id done (at the gym) and she replied Theres always tomorrow. How ironic. Welcome to my story all about me. Now you can get into the head of a stroke victim.
Doctors told the family to expect the worst and that Mia might not survive the night after she suffered a stroke and was put on a life support machine at Arrowe Park Hospital, Merseyside, nine years ago.
However, as they were preparing to switch it off, Mia opened her eyes and doctors realised that despite being completely immobile, she could still see, hear, and think as normal.
Mia was diagnosed with locked in syndrome a week later. Speaking of the book, Mias dad, Rick, added: Personally, I feel incredibly proud of Mia.
To write a book in quite literally a blink of an eye is outstanding. It took her around one year to write but it was a very laborious task, using her eyes to choose each letter. Her mother Carole, 62, said: It was totally all Mias idea.
She was in the hospital for around 14 months and writing poems and stories kept her on her alert and occupied. I think the idea stemmed from there really.
The family, including Mias brother Sam, 32, and sister Sophie, 25, all helped Mia using a spelling chart to write poems and short stories in the hospital.
Carole said, As you can imagine using the spelling graph took forever, it was very tiring for her, it is so much easier now she has the special computer. In this book, Mia writes about her experiences and addresses all the questions everyone probably wants to know but are too polite to ask. I am so proud of her, from the start we have all maintained a sink and swim mentality to what has happened and Mia has proven just how brave and driven she is.
This is not the first time Mia has amazed her parents with her determination. She completed a criminology course at Wirral Metropolitan College in 2017 before signing up for a forensics course with the Open University.
This year she will begin another course in criminal justice.
Speaking of her achievements her dad said, Shes a very determined young lady and has recently launched a campaign for disabled travellers. Before her stroke, she was a travel agent and shes always campaigning or raising money for charity. Metro

Fishermen to get kerosene oil subsidy from May 18
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development and Rural Economic Affairs Minister Vijith Wijayamuny Zoysa yesterday said the fishermen using outboard motorboats (MTRB) and out-board engine fiberglass reinforced boats (OFRP) will get kerosene oil subsidy by the government from May 18.
The Minister was addressing a media conference yesterday at the Rural Affairs Ministry. He said a Cabinet paper seeking the approval for diesel subsidy for one-day and multiday fishing boats would be presented to the Cabinet this week.
He said the government has to spend Rs. 5 billion on providing kerosene and diesel subsidy for fishermen. The government spends Rs. 349 million on the subsidy for the fishermen using the MTRB and another 3,368 million for the subsidy for the OFRP, the Minister said.
The Minister said the fishermen engaging in protests asking to reduce oil prices attempt to fulfill NGOs goals or other political movements.

Fishermen protest fuel price hike
Fishermen belonging to several villages along the North Western coastal belt stopped work refusing to go out to sea from May 13 night protesting against the fuel price hike. As such, most fish markets in the area looked desolate without fresh stocks of fish for sale.
Those involved in the protest campaign included fishermen from Nainamadama, Wennappuwa, Marawila, Thoduwa, Iranawila, Chilaw, Karukapane, Kandakuliya and Thalawila among others.
The Chilaw fish market which is a major fish market in the area was no exception. Black flags were seen fluttering in several cities and on beached boats.
In 2012, there was an increase in fuel prices when fishermen protested along highways. Antony Fernando of Chilaw died and several others were injured due to police shooting. Chilaw District Fishermens Organisation President Roshan Fernando warned that a repetition of 2012 protest campaign could be expected if the government failed to reduce the kerosene price.
Meanwhile, a protest was launched against the increase of fuel prices by a group of fishermen from Beruwela to Mannar, yesterday. The fishermen on strike had hoisted black flags around the Chillaw town in protest and the Chillaw fish market was deserted.
The government agreed to provide a fuel subsidy. However, fisheries societies say that this is not a feasible solution and that fishermen are facing many difficulties due to the sudden rise in fuel prices by a large amount.

A flat note  from a soapy throat
People have always made fun of my singing. Thats nothing new because I have been advised about my woeful talents as a vocalist since I was six-years-old. My first singing teacher at kindergarten, bless her musical soul, was a religious sister. She told me ever so politely, that my singing was unearthly. I took that as a compliment and so did my mother.
My mother naturally assumed that what the singing nun meant was that my vocalizing was out of this world. The entire family presumed that I would be picked as the leading star for the kindergarten Christmas concert. The casting had already been completed and all my playmates were duly assigned singing roles as shepherds, lambs and angels. How some of the more delinquent roughnecks fitted into the character of angels was beyond my comprehension.
The following week during rehearsals the nun with equal politeness but with more directness said: You have a fine voice. Dont spoil it by singing. I have decided to fit you in as the narrator. Clearly, I had been cast in the starring role because she thought I couldnt sing.
But primary school was quite a different kettle of fish where the cantankerous choirmaster at St. Bens with unceremonious bluntness proclaimed: Youre completely off key. And you cant carry a music note even in a bucket! My knowledge of notes at the time was confined to currency. As for the bucket part, I hoped then that it was about time the old, fossilized fool should kick one for good.
When I complained to my father about the old geezers rude appraisal of my singing abilities he didnt seem too surprised. Dont worry about it, he consoled, that was the same advice given to Bing Crosby by his first music teacher. Dads supporting consolation did not help particularly in view of the titters it prompted from my eavesdropping siblings. Naturally, I was heartbroken.
So you would have perceived by now that everyone around me has a rather negative critique about my singing. That used to hurt. However, with all my alleged drawbacks in this sphere, no one can accuse me of not being able to belt out my songs pretty loud. Still, I guess even if I exceed the power of a Pavarotti no one would change their judgement about my melodic talents. I have also realised that turning up the vocal volume doesnt help, particularly if you are out of tune.
As a songster I was never a smash hit. That is why I am saddest when I sing. So are those within my vocal range. I suspect they are obviously sadder even than I am. To gain confidence in my ability as a singer I tried practicing in front of my parents. That is because I thought parents were supposed to encourage their kids even when they are really dreadful at whatever they do. The family dog Punch joined the audience to watch the young home entertainer go through his paces.
As my parental audience and siblings leaned back in their chairs, little did I realise that they were preparing to be entertained, for all the wrong reasons. I had hardly started belting out the lyrics when that doggone dog started a mournful, horrendous wolf howl in accompaniment to my solo and almost drowned me out. No, no one invited him to a duet. Yes, he was really letting loose and spoiling my musical moment with an incredible repertoire of yips, yodels and yelps.
The mutts sing-song coupled with mine triggered a thunderous vocal participation among the neighbourhood hounds which joined in the canine equivalent of a spontaneous jam session. And then the audience cracked- up into paroxysms of laughter while the stupid canine Punch joined the mirthful merriment with his own variety of woofy yap-yaps. But Grandpa was amused in his own characteristic caustic style. He quoted Samuel Taylor Coleridges classic line: Swans sing before they die twere no bad thing, Should certain persons die before they sing.
So I decided to confine my vocal talents only in the shower. I would have joined my terrible sounding church choir at the time, but I was quite certain that my bathroom could hold that many people. At that tender age there was nothing which so fired my imagination as the prospect of showing off my vocal endowments before a packed audience, or any audience for that matter. But I never despaired and never ceased to chase my childhood dream. Well, the persistence paid off. I finally realized my ambition. I was actually invited to sing with some of the countrys leading show bands. Believe me, I have sung with the Jets, the Spits, the Moons, the Gyps and the GLords to name a few of the famous local ensembles.
But to be perfectly honest, I must mention that the bandleaders were my close buddies. Again I must elaborate that their nepotism was on rather a limited scale. I was only invited to join in during the refrain when the whole caboodle got into the act in full-throated unison. Okay, okay, so I admit the catchword is refrain because my vocal performance was confined solely to the chorus. Many of my detractors claim that the only reason I was called in to join the song and dance routine was because I was the master-of-ceremonies.
Well let me tell you for the last time, if Im going to sing like everyone else, then I dont need to sing at all. Today with the wonders of new-fangled audio digital technology I am determined to be a singing supernova. Regardless of whether I am off key my singing will be a hit, even if it happens to be a swan song on a flat note.
I possess the timbre, intention, sense of rhythm and more. I know people who are very much in tune and truly boring to hear singing because they are not expressive. Flat. And I know people, and musicians, who are not so in tune but very expressive. But no one can stop me singing in the shower. Singing in the shower is all fun and games. That is until I get shampoo in my mouth. And then it bubbles into a full-throated soap opera. [emailprotected]

FR by Prof. Ananda Samarasekara fixed for Sept.12
A Fundamental Right petition filed by former Chief Judicial Medical Officer of Colombo Prof. Ananda Samarasekara, seeking an interim order preventing the CID from arresting him in connection with the alleged loss of body parts of late Wasim Thajudeen was yesterday fixed for support by the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court fixed the matter for support on September 12.
The court was informed through the counsel of petitioner that he is expecting obtain instructions from the petitioner for the withdrawal of the petition since the petitioner had been granted bail by the Magistrates Court.
Professor Ananda Samarasekara, former Chief Judicial Medical Officer of Colombo Vice Chancellor of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) Malabe, filed this Fundamental Rights Petition against the infringements and imminent infringement of his fundamental rights in relation to the ongoing investigation into the death of late Mr. Wasim Thajudeen. Secretary of the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, and 12 others have been named as Respondents.
In the Petition, it is alleged that the incumbent JMO, Dr.Ajith Tennakoon has orchestrated a malicious campaign to discredit Professor Samarasekara and his findings in the Postmortem Report and thereafter, mislead the CID to investigate Prof.Samarasekara for an alleged loss of body parts of Thajudeen lawfully retained for further examination.
It is further alleged that the CID has acted with bias and has not conducted its own investigations and had accepted Dr.Tennakoons version as being correct and proceeded on such basis.
The Petition further alleges that the purported inquiry by the Ministry of Health has not been authorised by the Additional Magistrate of Colombo, and the submission of the purported preliminary investigation report as a final report is also in violation of Prof. Samarasekaras fundamental rights. Counsel Thishya Weragoda, Iresh Seneviratne and Chinthaka Sugathapala instructed by Ms. Thamila Dinushi Perera, appears for the Petitioner Prof. Ananda Samarasekara. Additional Solicitor General Ayesha Jinasena appeared for the Attorney General.

Gaza violence: Fresh protests against Israel follow deadly clashes

Fresh protests against Israel are expected in the Palestinian territories, a day after Israeli troops killed 55 people in Gaza.
Tuesday marks the 70th anniversary of what Palestinians call theNakba, or Catastrophe, that saw thousands flee amid the creation of Israel in 1948.
Tensions will be particularly high in Gaza where funerals for those killed on Monday are due to take place.
The violence came as the US opened a controversial embassy in Jerusalem.
The move of the US embassy from Tel Aviv has incensed Palestinians, who claim eastern Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.
They see the US move as backing Israeli control over the whole of the city, which Israel regards as its indivisible capital.
Palestinian officials said that, as well as those killed, about 2,700 people were injured in Monday's violence. It was the deadliest day in Gaza since the 2014 war.
Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said his military was acting in self-defence against Gaza's Islamist rulers, Hamas, who he said wanted to destroy Israel.
The Palestinian Authority's leader condemned a "massacre". The UN spoke of "outrageous human rights violations".
What happened at the Gaza border
Palestinians were demonstrating on Monday as they have been for six weeks as part of a protest, orchestrated by Hamas, called the "Great March of Return".
However, Monday's protests - and those planned for Tuesday - are the culmination as they mark the anniversary of Israel's creation in 1948 and commemorate the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who subsequently fled their homes or were displaced in the war that followed.
Monday also coincided with the dedication ceremony for the US embassy.
Israel said some 40,000 Palestinians had taken part in "violent riots" at 13 locations along the Gaza Strip security fence.
Palestinians hurled stones and incendiary devices, while the Israeli military used tear gas and live fire from snipers.
Netanyahu defended his military, saying: "Every country has an obligation to defend its borders.
"The Hamas terrorist organisation declares its intention to destroy Israel and sends thousands to breach the border fence in order to achieve this goal. We will continue to act with determination to protect our sovereignty and our citizens."
An Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman said soldiers fired on those engaged in "terrorist activity and not on demonstrators, who were dispersed by usual means such as tear gas and according to the rules of engagement".
Announcing three days of mourning, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said: "Today once again, the massacres against our people continue."
What has the international reaction been
There has been a sometimes fiercely conflicting response:
White Housespokesman Raj Shah said: "The responsibility for these tragic deaths rests squarely with Hamas... Hamas is intentionally and cynically provoking this response"
Kuwaitdrafted a UN Security Council statement calling for an independent inquiry into the violence - and expressing "outrage and sorrow" - but this was blocked by the US
EUforeign policy chief Federica Mogherini and the UK called for restraint
Germanysaid Israel had the right to defend itself but should do so proportionately
France'sPresident Emmanuel Macron condemned violence by the Israeli military against the protesters
Turkeysaid the US shared responsibility with Israel for a "vile massacre" and that it was recalling its ambassadors from both the US and Israel
One of the strongest statements came fromUNHigh Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, who condemned the "shocking killing of dozens, injury of hundreds by Israeli live fire"
South Africaalso recalled its ambassador to Israel, condemning "the indiscriminate and grave manner of the latest Israeli attack"
Was the violence linked to the opening of the embassy
There were clashes between Israeli police and protesters who raised Palestinian flags outside the new embassy in Jerusalem and several protesters were detained.
Hamas had said the border protests were being stepped up for Monday and Tuesday anyway, but Abbas's response to the US embassy move showed the anger among Palestinians.
He said: "We hear that they opened an embassy today. It is a settlement, not an embassy. A US settlement in East Jerusalem."
The atmosphere at the dedication ceremony was certainly in stark contrast to that at the Gaza border.
President Donald Trump sent a video message to the event, saying Israel had the "right to determine its own capital".
His daughter, Ivanka, unveiled the seal of the embassy, and her husband, Jared Kushner, said in his address: "When President Trump makes a promise he keeps it."
Netanyahu said: "President Trump, by recognising history, you have made history."
Why is the embassy move so controversial
The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem is not recognised internationally and, according to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the final status of Jerusalem is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks.
Israel has occupied East Jerusalem since the 1967 Middle East war. It effectively annexed the sector, though this was not recognised by any countries until Trump's declaration in December 2017.
Since 1967, Israel has built a dozen settlements, home to about 200,000 Jews, in East Jerusalem. These are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.
Various countries once had embassies based in Jerusalem but many moved after Israel passed a law in 1980 formally making Jerusalem its capital.

Giving  child a pet  could ultimately  turn them  vegetarian
While it is a well documented fact that looking after a pet encourages children to be responsible, a new study now says that those with hamsters and gerbils could also be influencing young pet owners eating habits in later life.
The study claims that giving a child a pet could ultimately turn them vegetarian, ad the more domestic animals living under the family roof, the higher the chances of a child going meat-free in adulthood.
The study saw psychologist Sydney Heiss, of the State University of New York at Albany, question 325 young adults about their diet and pet-owning history, with the results published in the journal Appetite.
She said that exposure to a greater number of different childhood pets leads to greater restriction of animal products from the diet through more positive attitudes towards animals and a moral opposition to animal exploitation.
She further added, Individuals who grew up around a greater variety of pets were more likely to engage in greater degrees of meat avoidance in adulthood. The Scientist

Harmonious  percussions
Though challenging,
the job is nothing new for Professor Ratnayake who has performed the sitar in his original compositions in distinguished venues across the world. He has collaborated with internationally recognized artists like pianists Masahiko Satoh, Joe Chindamo, Ben Waltzer, and Freddie Ravel, cellist Ramon Jaffe, guitarist Thibault Cauvin, violinists Miranda Cuckson and Helen Ayers, saxophonist Eric Marienthal
The unlikeliest event can mount up to be almost certainty because improbability is an illusion. On March 26, 1778, Ludwig Van Beethoven gave his first public performance. His father revealed the musicians age: six years! Sri Lankas Pradeep Ratnayake took to music at five years. He established his brand name as a sitarist.
Recently, however, he moved the sitar aside to brace himself for a different allegory.
He was the chosen musician from Sri Lanka to compose for the Australian saxophone and piano duo HD Duo: Dr Michael Duke and David Howie. A cross-cultural mission, enterprising in its own right, the project concentrated on the commonwealth musicians. The project materialised recently at the Sri Jayewardenepura University a few days before a spectacle of music connoisseurs and academics. Though challenging, the job is nothing new for Professor Ratnayake who has performed the sitar in his original compositions in distinguished venues across the world. He has collaborated with internationally recognized artists like pianists Masahiko Satoh, Joe Chindamo, Ben Waltzer, and Freddie Ravel, cellist Ramon Jaffe, guitarist Thibault Cauvin, violinists Miranda Cuckson and Helen Ayers, saxophonist Eric Marienthal. Professor Ratnayake was tasked with composing for them pieces that collaborated with the star. Ratnayake is known for giving the sitar a particularly Sri Lankan sound  through the incorporation of its folk music, use of its traditional drums and including harmonies in playing this basically melodic instrument.
Tough fight
Compared to England and other European countries, we have not much progressed or evolved in music. So we need to give these countries a tough fight. Originally ours is folk music. How can we go to the world with folk music alone Essentially, we need to extract the elements of other types of music, Ratnayake elaborated his mission.
To adorn the eight-minute composition Professor Ratnayake banked on numerous techniques: the melodies from the folk music, drum percussions and Jala raga of Indian classical music. He made use of two instrumental vannamas, gajaga and thuraga, to enhance the folk musical element.
Our local music is composed of three essential elements, according to Ratnayake: Indian, folk and western music. Much of what we get to hear today is influenced by at least one of these genres.
Influential music
When I think of our own traditions what comes to my mind first is the drums. So I went for the drum percussions. As for the influence of Indian music, I took the Jala range. That came in handy.
The combination of percussions, Jala and Vannam enhanced the dialogue between the piano and saxophone.
Commenting on the concert, Sri Jayewardenepura University Vice Chancellor Professor Sampath Amaratunga said that Professor Ratnayake is the one who made the sitar close to the piano.
He is an asset to us. An asset to the country. An asset to the music field. Most academics come to be questioned at a certain practical level. But when it comes to Professor Ratnayake, he constantly engages in research and contributes to the music field much practically, Professor Amaratunga said.
Dubbed as Sri Lankan Ravi Shankar, the academic cum sitarist bridges the two cultures of Asia and West, according to Professor Amaratunga.
Ratnayakes first passion was for north Indian raga music. He practised the sitar while studying the western music. At Colombo University, he studied jazz and computer technology. That experience led him to compose the award-winning score to the film Siddhartha Gauthama.
Varied talents
Some software can produce the exact effect of an instrument. But such software is quite expensive.
At the university, Ratnayake has come across several groups of students.
There are students who are interested in many areas. Some are brilliant at composing music, but not really into singing. The singers sometimes cannot compose music. Some are good at music arrangement. Some are good at technology. We need to handpick them and direct them in a practical path, Professor Ratnayake added.
This harmonious evening was graced by the presence of Sri Jayewardenepura University Vice Chancellor Prof Sampath Amaratunge, Graduate Studies Dean Prof Hemanthi Ranasinghe, Medical Sciences Dean Prof Surangi Yasewardene, Humanities and Social Sciences Dean Prof D P S Chandrakumara, Applied Sciences Dean Prof Sudantha Liyanage and Engineering Dean Dr S A A M Subasinghe graced the occasion with Professors Carlo Fonseka and J B Disanayaka.

Haycarb records turnover of  Rs 15.5 billion
Haycarb PLC reported revenue of Rs. 15.5 billion, profit before tax of Rs. 926 million and profit after tax of Rs. 774 million for financial year 2017/18. The earnings per share of equity holders of the company was Rs. 22.63 for the year.
The Chairman of Haycarb PLC and its parent company Hayleys PLC, Mohan Pandithage said that the significant growth in the top line in spite of key challenges in the supply chain for raw material has proven Haycarbs strength and position as a leader in the coconut shell based activated carbon industry. He added that the Environmental Engineering arm, Puritas (Pvt.) Ltd. has reported notable growth and contributed positively to the results of the group.
Haycarb PLC Managing Director, Rajitha Kariyawasan explained that the activated carbon business of the company faced significant margin pressure due to the shortage of supplies and substantial increase in prices of coconut shell charcoal in Sri Lanka, India and Thailand particularly during the second half of the financial year due to adverse weather conditions, that resulted in lower profits from the carbon business in the current year.
The availability of raw material in Indonesia on the other hand regained near-normalcy in the last quarter after shortages experienced for two consecutive years, even though the prices remained high due to the scarcity and shortage of the material in other countries.
Kariyawasan explained that the main objective during the year was to ensure that long standing end customers and distributors were supplied with their product requirements, which compelled Haycarb to absorb majority of raw material cost increases, to allow its global distribution network to average out price increases to customers, and mitigate the panic in the distribution chain.
Therefore although Haycarb had to negotiate increase in prices of its activated carbon products, prices were increased with a time lag, as the decision to shield our customers against the full impact of charcoal price increases was made in the medium term interest of the business that resulted in the short term erosion of profit margins.
Kariyawasan said that Haycarbs Environmental Engineering business, Puritas (Pvt.) Ltd. has posted creditable results backed by growth in its local and regional presence as a superior provider of water and waste water purification solutions, while the activated carbon end products manufactured and marketed by this sector also showed satisfactory growth.

How the Leaning  Tower of Pisa  stays intact
The Leaning Tower of Pisa has always been a baffling mystery for scientists.
Even though the 58-metre tall tower leans at a five-degree angle, it has survived four earthquakes since 1280 with not one scratch on it.
How has it managed to stay intact The answer may be the soil.
Dynamic soil-structure interaction (DSSI) is what a research team attributes to its survival, the Daily Mail reported.
Ironically, the very same soil that caused the leaning instability and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse, can be credited for helping it survive these seismic events, lead author of the study Professor Mylonakis, of the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Bristol, told the Daily Mail.
The team believes combination of the Towers stiffness and the foundation soils softness causes the vibrational characteristics of the structure to be modified substantially, in such a way that the Tower does not resonate with earthquake ground motion, the report stated. AFP

With the hosts having declared on 455-8, Gloucestershire started brightly but failed to build partnerships after opener James Bracey (28) was caught. Chris Dent (66) and Benny Howell (47) dug in but Hilton Cartwrights career-best 4-33 helped bowl them out for 210.
The visitors were put in again after tea at Lords, losing Howell and Dent again to close 179 runs behind on 66-2.

## Title: The leader committed to social justice

The leader committed to social justice
May Day is synonymous with workers. When May Day and workers are discussed, the name that the United National Party can never be forgotten is that of R. Premadasa. His precious life was snatched away by mindless terrorism while organising the May Day celebration of the United National Party. That was on May 1, 1993.
He was the leader who introduced such positive terms as poverty elimination and upliftment of the downtrodden to our political glossary. He was the leader who launched an accelerated journey with genuine interest to transform the meaning of these terms into reality.
He had a dream, a vision and an ambition for the oppressed, the downtrodden of our society. He had the courage to move forward undeterred and unfettered overcoming obstacles, challenges and impediments in the arduous journey to realize this dream.
When mulling over R. Premadasas dream for the future of Sri Lankan society, I am reminded of the legendary speech I have a dream by civil right activist Martin Luther King who waged a battle for freedom, equality and human rights in American society. My memory goes back to some parts of the speech delivered to over 250,000 civil right supporters from the steps of Lincoln Memorial in Washington.
President Premadasas dream
I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low. The rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight. I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character.
In fact, the foundation and the underpinning principle of Martin Luther Kings dream and R. Premadasas dream were not two, but one and the same. At every meeting of Premadasas presidential election campaign, I always referred to Martin Luther Kings dream. By making him the President, we ought to realize our own similar dreams we had for the country. When he made appointments to his first Cabinet, I was selected as State Minister of Housing, the subject he was in charge of previously. I will never forget what he told me at his office soon after being sworn in.
Do you know the Ministry youve got, he asked.
Yes was my reply.
It is my Ministry that has been given to you, he said with a smile on his face.
Sirisena Cooray was the Cabinet minister of Housing. I was the state minister.
First, there will be Gam Udawa at Mahiyangana, there are villages never visited by ministers. Imthiyaz I need commitment. Do everything possible to ease the suffering of those people. I knew he was speaking from the heart. I still feel these words echoing in my ears whenever I think of this great leader.
He was the leader who was truly sensitive to the pain and distress of hapless families living in wattle and daub huts, slums and shanties and makeshift shelters made of planks exposed to vagaries of weather. He was the leader responsive to the needs of families who took turns to sleep as their heavily cramped shelters did not permit such luxuries.
It was to wipe their tears and bring smiles back to their faces; he introduced a raft of housing programmes including model houses, twin houses, one hundred thousand housing programme, one million housing programme and international year of housing.
Poverty alleviation programmes
Janasaviya was our own innovative concept of poverty alleviation. It was a programme totally devoid of narrow politics designed for families engaged in an incessant struggle to eke out a living. Sevana foster parent scheme was introduced to change the destiny of children who had lost their parents. Mid-day meal programme for schools was launched for children attending schools without a proper meal. Free school uniform programme was initiated to ensure the continuation of school education of children of economically backward families who could not even afford uniforms for their children. Mawathe Api was commenced to uplift and bring a sense of dignity to the lives of people begging in streets. Bamboo gate programme at unprotected level crossings was implemented to ensure the safety of people.
Presidential mobile service programme was held countrywide to bring politicians to the doorstep of people who would otherwise never have an opportunity to bring their grievances to the notice of the politicians.
Kepakaru Gammana was an innovative programme to enlist the support of philanthropists, additional to the provisions allocated by the government to economically empower people living in penury.
No or cannot were words totally alien to him. He took the initiative to launch the Sevana Fund as a source of funding for services that could not be offered to the people through the financial provisions of the government.
For all major religions of the country, religious affairs ministries were established bringing to the fore, the noble concept of treating everybody alike.
Development initiatives such as Gam Udawa (village reawakening), which covered an entire district accompanied by regional Gam Udawa at the divisional secretariat levels and Weekly Programme which interlinked diverse fields were conducted throughout the country to achieve the objectives of integrated development.Gramodaya Mandala programme was introduced with the aim of uplifting villages and fostering unity in the village.
Effecting a revolutionary change in the traditional administrative structure, the concept of Divisional Secretariats was inaugurated replacing the Government Agent system bringing officials closer to the public while taking the benefits of development expeditiously to poverty-stricken rural communities. Fifteen thousand village programme was started to as an alternative to the traditional model of development.
Laws were enacted making it mandatory to have forty percent youth representation at local government elections in order to accord due recognition to youth population while enabling them to make a greater contribution in the governing process.
When Premadasa assumed duties as President he famously said that he had been handed over country similar to torch burning from both ends.
He was referring the insurgency in the south and the raging armed conflict in the north. Schools and government offices remained forcibly closed. Political activists were threatened with death if they did not resign from their posts, public servants who defied orders not to report for duty were killed, families of security force personnel were under constant death threats, use electricity after 6.00 in the evening was banned, government property including building and SLTB buses were torched, those who cast their votes at elections were murdered, coffins of those killed by insurgents could not be raised above the knee level, the countrys very existence as a democracy was in grave danger. It was during such a time President Premadasa took up the reins of government.
Principles of democracy
His fervent appeal to those engaged in violence was, Do not harm the lives, I am willing to negotiate with you. I am even ready to come blindfolded to any jungle of your choice.
That was his compassionate and humane appeal. That was a heartfelt plea. He wanted to stop mindless killings. He wanted to protect and uphold principles of democracy. But his appeals were an excise in futility. During the first five months of his presidency, he did everything possible to restore peace through consensus, compromise and consultation. Finally, the southern insurgency was crushed by the armed forces. He was deeply saddened by the lack of progress in the efforts to find a negotiated settlement to problems in the north and south of the country.
He did not have a hidden agenda. In foreign relations, the dignity of the country was the underpinning principle. He steadfastly stood for a non-aligned foreign policy that respected justice over might. His decisions to send home the Indian Peace Keeping Force and close the Israeli diplomatic mission were examples of his forthrightness and principled stand and showed in no uncertain terms that he was not ready to tolerate any force that sought to undermine the dignity and sovereignty of the country.
R. Premadasa becoming the leader of the country was truly a revolution. Overcoming seemingly insurmountable socioeconomic barriers and challenges posed by deeply entrenched caste consciousness he was able to reach the highest position in the country. It was with his assumption of office as President, the society at large started to believe that caste and creed were no barriers to reach the topmost position of the country. All those who contributed to making that revolution possible through the United National Party could justifiably be proud of this achievement.
Under the astute leadership of Premadasa, the United National Party was able to emerge victorious in most of the rural electorates with a Sinhala-Buddhist majority.
As he was able to understand peoples consciousness and had a correct vision for the common people, economic and social changes precipitated by his policies positively impacted the lives of the overwhelming majority of countrymen. The United National Party has always endorsed and unwaveringly stood for social justice and equality, the existence of a democratic society and the principle of according equal opportunities for all. It has fearlessly protected these principles whenever they were threatened.
I believe that preservation of this heritage of the United National Party passing it on to the future generation and discharging this responsibility with courage and conviction is the greatest honour that can be paid to President Premadasa.

The dansal was headed by a cross-section of team members from diverse backgrounds and partners that all came together to ensure the distribution of apples throughout the night.
Commenting on this years Vesak celebrations, Arosha Perera CEO, Leo Burnett Sri Lanka said, This year, our team came together once again, to continue our long-standing tradition of hosting a creative apple dansal for Vesak. Apples are an important symbol in our agencys history, which spans across 83 years.
Apples symbolize Leo Burnetts positive attitude and disposition. When he set up an ad agency in the height of the Great Depression in Chicago- many joked that he would have to close his doors and sell apples for a living. Leo however with his reach for the stars mindset and resilience, built one of the most iconic agencies of its time, despite the challenges he faced.
Apples have welcomed visitors to every Leo Burnett office around the world, and anyone is welcome to take one at any time. We are pleased to have been able to continue participating in annual Vesak festivities, in a way that honours an integral part of our agencys narrative and legacy.

Of love and destruction
From the battles between the gods of old and their struggle for power and to modern day problems that might lead to our extinction, Constellation is a band that addresses issues concerning love and destruction. Melodies speaks to Eshantha Perera of Constellation about this passion of theirs.
Gallows of the Mind was well received by a lot of people. It was a big breakthrough for Constellation. Here partly the inspiration was Egyptian Mythology  the Children of Ra the sun God. Like the old Greek and Roman Gods and others deities worshipped through the world, even the Egyptian Gods also fought amongst themselves. Some of these myths have been brought to life in literature like the Percy Jackson stories.
There we talked about the Egyptian God Set, who is the brother of Osiris. He killed the God Osiris by chopping him into many pieces. We are big fans of Egyptian Mythology. What we tried to do is put Set in a hypothetical situation where in the present day you have a massive following of Set - People who believe that Set is the rightful God to rule the earth which is like a cult. They have come together to bring Set back and put him on the throne and wage a war of righteousness. If there was a universal theme to our music I guess that would be the condition of human nature. It is what we think god wants us to do. And I think there may be a cult out there for real  People worshipping Set. I mean we do have Satanism in this world.
When I speak of Satanism I am not talking about those psychos who go out there and kill in the name of Satan. There is legitimate Satanism where they do not see Satan as the Devil. They have a proper bible and they are pretty decent people,  explained Eshantha Perera.
Gallows of the Mind which was released very recently is one of their most prominent releases. That addresses how humans are destroying the environment.
It was in line with our newest theme in music. We had a stage of evolution from back then to now. One of the two songs that we composed for TNL onstage  was the Blight on Gaia. Gaia is essentially nature. So we speak of how people are ruining nature  we are destroying forests and polluting the world and that was one message we wanted to give out. So the two singles were pretty good compositions for us, said Perera. Perera also emphasized on his worry that technology may be our undoing one day.
Currently we are working on an album which is supposed to come out somewhere in August. One of the initial themes we have for the album is a new world order. Currently when you look at the situation in the world technology is starting to become the new world order. There is an issue as to how technology is ruling us and technology is where our information comes from. We talk about technology and politics as well. Political policies in the world are not always positive. But you get some pretty decent and honest politicians out there. There is a lot of war and cyber terrorism. Devouring the Sun spoke of a new world order where humans were evolving to a point where with technology we are becoming slaves. We will become our own extinction, stated Perera.
Perera and his band members are in no ways anti-religious. They simply make an effort to highlight what is happening in the world right now in connection with religion.
We do not call ourselves anti- religious. I am a catholic and there are a few Buddhists in my band. There is even one atheist. But we collectively believe that organized religion in its own way can be an issue. Children of God was released back then and something which will be improved and re-released again with the album in August. Here we were being very sarcastic concerning its main theme which was War. A lot of people even kill in the name of God. And I mean religion should be of love. God never wants us to kill someone else. There again we were being sarcastic because we were saying how hypocritical people are killing in the name of a god of love. You kill in the name of God and then go to places of worship and talk about love. It is hypocrisy, challenges Perera.
Perera points to the imperfection of human understanding and its limits and the inability of some people to empathize and understand the pain others feel. Who I call God is who a Muslim would call Allah. It is the same person. But we as human beings. Religion is a man -made word. It is not a word that God gave us. Every single religion says do the right thing. Be nice to other people. This is very universal. God may be called by other people as Gaia, Mother Nature or the cosmic energy, it is still the same thing. We as a band feel that these are walls that have been built around each other. These are walls that we have built. That is another topic we touch on and also we touch on things that degrade humanity. But if you take religious personalities take Pope Francis. He is a wonderful person. An amazing individual who is honorable and decent.
He has said that if a man says he loves another man, or a woman says she loves another woman, who am I to judge I am not god. You cant get more down to earth than that. Because love is love. We have no right to question someone else as long as it does not harm. Some of our stuff may not be easy to decipher. It is not very direct with metaphors, explained Perera.
Constellation have always wanted to play progressive metal. Technical stuff.
Honestly I do not know from where the word Constellation came from. I know that there was some theory why we chose that name. But now when we all think about it we do not know why we chose that name for the love of god! So Constellation June/July 2014, was when Constellation came together. What happened was that one of the founders invited me to join the band that was being put together for TNL onstage asked me whether I am in. I said I am in.
I liked what I heard and we got together. In the beginning I was not meant to be the drummer. I was just supposed to be the vocalist. So we kept practicing and the night before the preliminaries we had small incident and we were left with no drummer. So I ended up drumming and singing at thew same time, said Perera.
Constellation went onto win TNL onstage 2014 and was coached by Andrew Obeyesekere of Stigmata for the finals.
We played two originals and we won. We were the only band in onstage history to have a drummer vocalist and we pretty much got all the awards that year. It was a very special day for us. And right after that in December we had our first gig called The Dying Winter Sleeps alongside Stigmata and a few other bands as well. We were honored to immediately do this after singing onstage, and do it with a great band like Stigmata. We have a lot of respect for them. It meant a lot for us.
We have a lot of talent in our band. I mean we have the brains here. There are a few dead metal elements here and there but not too much. Our music is very melodic and ambient. Our music on average is nine to ten minutes long, summed up Perera.

Minister promises to resolve human-elephant conflict
Wildlife Minister Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka has promised to resolve the human-elephant conflict in the next one-and-a-half years.
He explained that it was difficult to provide solutions to a long-standing problem, but he would work on implementing a strong foundation to establish a new mechanism to solve the human-elephant conflict.
The Minister made these observations to the media after a meeting held to discuss the issues surrounding the human-elephant conflict in the Meda Mahanuwara area yesterday afternoon.
The Minister had come to Kandy to inspect a wild elephant that the Wildlife Department had managed to capture. The elephant which resided in the Victoria, Randenigala, Rantambe reserves, had been responsible for the deaths of a few individuals in the area. If I had three years, I would solve the problem once and for all, observed the minister.
Minister Fonseka further observed that as it was not easy to capture such violent elephants. He had directed all regional officers to do so and said that assistance from the Wildlife office in Colombo would be provided to all regional officers to accomplish the task.
He added that either he or his deputy minister would participate at such occasions. The Minister noted that it was not only humans, but elephants that are also killed as a result of the conflict, and while the Department captured one elephant in Meda Mahanuwara for the death of humans, two elephants have been killed in Batticaloa as a result of human action. In the wake of such deaths, questions with regard to the actual effectiveness of electric fences have arisen, he said.
The Minister said that he would also not allow the smuggling of baby elephants which had been taking place in the recent past.

Navin de Silva schoolboy cricketer par excellence
Readers please note this article appeared in the book CRICKET CAMEO by the author published in 2014.
Sri Lanka had played Test cricket and one day cricket for more than 30 years but have yet to produce an all-rounder even faintly resembling guys in the caliber of Kapil Dev, Imran Khan, Sir Ian Botham or Sir Richard Hadlee.
We certainly would have had one if Navin de Silva decided to extend his excellent school cricket career in the eighties. Built like a mini battle tank he used to tonk the ball at will in the pocket sized Campbell Park. When the news got around that Navin was at the crease all the cricket enthusiast be it spectators watching in adjacent grounds like Campbell Place, Bloomfield grounds or even wandering schoolboys after school would make a beeline to watch the wonder boy in action at the tiny Campbell Park where it was packed to the hilt. His lusty hits landed many a time at Campbell Place the adjacent road bordering the park. He was not only a mauler of the red ball but also had finis and technique, mainly due to Milroy Muthuvelus guidance (Muthuvelu played and shone for Wesley during the early sixties).
Due to his outstanding efforts with the bat and the ball for Wesley College in 1981, Navi was named the captain of the Sri Lanka Schools cricket team. They toured England and this was the very first tour undertaken by a Sri Lankan schoolboy cricket team to play an English schoolboy cricket team.
The team was a star studded outfit which consisted of Arjuna Ranatunga, Aravinda de Silva, Rumesh Ratnayake, Graeme Labrooy, Ashley de Silva etc. who adorned Sri Lanka cricket with distinction later on. Arjuna and Aravinda fitted into the world class category like ducks taking to water. As they all played under Navin and had he continued he would have been a huge asset to Sri Lanka cricket as an all-rounder.
When inquired about why he refrained from continuing where he let off, he informed me that his father wanted him to pursue a professional career according to family tradition. As a result he opted to become a pilot with Air Lanka, now known as Sri Lankan Airlines where Navin became the youngest captain of Air Lanka at that time.
Before Sanath Jayasuriya came to the scene, Navin was quite a revelation and he showed that he could thump the best of fast bowlers over cover for six. He was also a fantastic fast medium bowler who was fair skinned and broad in build and looked a bit like Ian Botham although he was closer to earth than Botham by about six inches.
It has to be mentioned that 1962 was the year when late Minister Gamini Dissanayake was making a bold bid to attain Test status for Sri Lanka. As a precursor to this the Minister quite judiciously arranged this strong schoolboy outfit to tour England soon after the senior Sri Lankan team led by Bandula Warnapura which was another talented outfit then. The senior team nor the junior team let the Minister or the Sri Lankan cricket fans down because they shone well enabling us to gain Test status. As a matter of fact Navins team won all the matches bar one.
School cricket in my time from the sixties to the eighties when Navin played, the spectators attended the matches in hordes. They were from all ages and different strata of society. Nowadays the scenario had changed so much that most of the grounds where schools first eleven matches are played, only the teams and the umpires are left to be seen. When inquired about this pathetic situation Navin was of the view that there were too many schools matches being played. It used to be 9 matches per season in his day Navin pointed out that nowadays this has shot up to about 20 and as a result the player quality has dropped drastically.
Navin also noted that tuition classes had misguided the youth into neglecting sports and yet another valid reason was the cricket coaching kades where every Tom, Dick and Harry donning track suits and looking like Manning Market mudalalis have joined the band wagon to earn their fill in lining their pockets which is the name of the game in this unfortunate country of ours! No wonder the quality of schoolboy cricket has gone to the dogs. However mechanisms are to be installed in future and if they are to be properly streamlined and effectively executed we should be able to get quality schoolboy cricketers in the caliber of Arjuna Ranatunga, Aravinda de Silva, Roshan Mahanama, Asanka Gurusinha, Ashley de Silva and the list goes on.

Neymar wins French player of the year prize, rejects transfer talk
Paris, Sunday: Neymar was named as France's player of the year at an awards ceremony in Paris on Sunday, and later brushed away questions over his future.
The Paris Saint-Germain superstar took the prize despite missing the last three months of the season due to injury. The world's most expensive player scored 19 goals in just 20 league games for PSG before suffering a foot injury in February that required surgery in his native Brazil.
He has not played since, and only returned to France from his homeland at the start of this month, fuelling speculation that he could seek to leave the club after just one season.
"I am very touched and very happy with our season. It is an honour. Without my teammates, I would never have received this award," said the 26-year-old, who collected the prize from his illustrious compatriot Ronaldo.
Neymar, who joined in PSG's Ligue 1 title celebrations on Saturday night, refused to discuss his future after collecting his award.
"We talk about these things every time the transfer window comes around. I don't want to talk about anything at the moment," he said.
"Everyone knows why I came here, what my objectives are. Right now, my objective is the World Cup, not talking about transfers.
"I spend my whole life, every transfer window, talking about it. It's a bit annoying."
Neymar beat two of his PSG teammates to the prize, voted for by his fellow players -- Edinson Cavani, Ligue 1's leading scorer this season with 28 goals, and Kylian Mbappe were also nominees, along with Marseille winger Florian Thauvin.
Neymar was signed from Barcelona for a world-record 222 million euros ($264 million) last August, and helped PSG on their way to a clean sweep of the domestic trophies.
However, his injury appeared to cost Unai Emery's team dear in their Champions League last-16 tie against Real Madrid -- he was unable to play in the second leg, and PSG lost 5-2 on aggregate. AFP

O Brien scores Irelands first Test hundred
Dublin, Monday: Kevin O'Brien scored Ireland's first Test hundred when he reached three figures against Pakistan on the fourth day of their inaugural match at this level at Malahide on Monday.
A two off left-arm quick Mohammad Amir saw O'Brien to his hundred in 186 balls, including 10 fours -- a shot greeted with cheers from a crowd of several hundred.
It was the 34-year-old O'Brien's first century for Ireland since he made the fastest-ever World Cup hundred by any batsman, off 50 balls, against England at Bangalore in 2011.
Ireland, made to follow-on, were in danger of a heavy defeat when O'Brien, who top-scored with 40 in their first-innings 130, walked in at 95 for four on Monday.
But he retained his composure to complete a fifty off 100 balls -- the exact reverse of the figures in his record-breaking feat in India seven years ago.
O'Brien, whose older brother Niall is Ireland's wicket-keeper, received excellent support from all-rounder Stuart Thompson -- the second Ireland batsman to make a Test fifty -- in a seventh-wicket stand of 114 that denied Pakistan an innings win in this one-off match.
When Thompson was bowled by leg-spinner Shadab Khan for 53, Ireland were 271 for seven. Tyrone Kane extended Ireland's lead to three figures and gave them a chance, admittedly an outside one, of becoming just the fourth side in the 141 years of Test history to win a match after following-on. AFP

PAFFREL renews calls to implement legislation
The People's Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) yesterday renewed its calls to implement the proposed legislation to limit the spending of political parties and candidates for election campaigning before the upcoming provincial council elections.
PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi, writing to Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha, requested to speed up the proposed bill on 'Campaign Finance Upper Limitation for Elections,' to ensure a level playing field for all candidates. Election watchdog PAFFREL presented a draft bill for this purpose to the minister on August 3, 2017 and forwarded it to all 225 MPs for their perusal. Hettiarachchi said the bill was drafted with the consultation of election secretariat officials, political parties and intellectuals in the relevant fields.
He added that the proposed bill had set the upper limit of a candidates election expenditure as Rs. 50 per voter.
Provisions to disqualify the candidates if they do not properly declare their assets and liabilities, had also been included in the bill. The government may bring in amendments as necessary. During the last local government elections, there were instances where candidates had spent millions to bribe voters in their electorates, Hettiarachchi said.
A candidate in Moneragala had spent about Rs. 40 million and we have even filed a case in the courts in this regard. If this trend continues, voters would be bought by candidates and the intentions of revising the electoral system would not be realised. We will not give up our struggle to see this legislation through, he added. Asked from a Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry Legal Division official, she said the bill had been added to this years action plan and therefore, it would be presented this year. She added that the ministry had to give priority for Local Government and Provincial Council Elections Amendment Bills during the last few months.
However, when contacted by the Daily News, Ministry Secretary Kamal Padmasiri said he was unaware of such a draft bill which had been handed over to the minister by the PAFFREL, last year.

PM instructs Sathosa to import dates for Ramadan
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had instructed Sathosa to import sufficient supplies of dates for the upcoming month of Ramadan.
He advised thus on the request of Muslim Religious Affairs Minister M. H. A. Haleem and National Unity and Reconciliation Minister A. H. M. Fowzie.
Dates are distributed to Muslims during Ramdan through Mosques. This year, steps had been taken to distribute 150 metric tonnes of dates donated by Saudi Arabia. In addition, Sathosa too had been requested to import another 150 metric tonnes of dates to be distributed among the public.
The request was made due to the decline in date supplies from the Middle East as their harvests had been dwindling as of recent times. Further, private retailers such as Cargills too, had been requested the same by the Prime Minister.

The Principal of Badulla Tamil Girls Maha Vidyalaya, who was allegedly compelled to kneel and worship Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dasanayake, yesterday filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court seeking a declaration that her Fundamental Rights had been violated by the Chief Minister and provincial educational authorities.
The petitioner Bavanie Raguath cited Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dasanayake, Uva Provincial Secretary of Education Ministry, Uva Provincial Director of Education Minister and five others as respondents. The petitioner stated that on January 2, 2018, she had received a letter written by a parent to the Uva Chief Minister seeking the Chief Ministers recommendation to get his daughter admitted to the Badulla Tamil Girls Maha Vidyalaya. The petitioner stated that she was unable to accommodate the aforesaid request since it was contrary to the relevant circulars.
The petitioner further said on January 3, 2018, she had received two telephone calls from the secretary to the Ministry of Education Uva Province, requesting her to attend the Provincial Council Office.
The petitioner stated that the Chief Minister had made several impolite, rude comments and inquired about a party thrown for the governor of Uva Province which is merely an allegation tainted with malice.
The petitioner further stated in order to get herself excused from the aforesaid terrorizing and traumatizing situation, she was compelled to kneel down and worship the Chief Minister and pleaded that she is very sorry for any wrongdoing from her side. The petitioner stated that she is still not in receipt of any favorable response to date. This petition had been filed through Counsel Sunil Watagala.

Prof. Ricardo Hausmann, in Colombo
Advocata Institute is organizing a Public lecture by Prof Ricardo Hausmann, the director of Centre for International Development (CID) at Harvard University on Wednesday May 16, at the Lighthouse (LKI) 24, Horton Place, Colombo 07 from 5.30 P.M. to 7.45 P.M.
Prof Hausmann is a leading expert on development economics and a practitioner on finding enablers for growth in developing countries. He will speak on the topic of Accessing knowhow for development.
Economies grow by adding new products and services to their production portfolio and not by producing more of the same kinds of products argue Prof. Hausmann. The key to such diversification is access to know-how, but know-how often has to come from abroad. This is because it is often easier to move brains to new countries than to move new know-how into brains. In the experience of Singapore, India, Vietnam and most other dynamic economies, three channels of know-how transfer stand out: FDI, immigration and diaspora networks.
In this lecture, Prof. Hausmann explores the relationship between economic development and the accumulation of know-how. He will in particular discuss how to tackle Sri Lankas limited export diversification.
Prof Hausmann and his team at CID has been conducting research on how to diversify Sri Lankas exports to compete globally, achieving dynamic growth and upgrading knowhow in the economy.
Before joining the faculty at Harvard, Prof. Hausmann was the Chief Economist of the Inter-American Development Bank (1994-2000), where he created the Research Department. He has served as Minister of Planning of Venezuela (1992-1993) and as a member of the Board of the Central Bank of Venezuela. He also served as Chair of the IMF-World Bank Development Committee. He holds a PhD in economics from Cornell University.
Advocata Institute is an independent free-market policy think tank based in Colombo.
The lecture would be followed up Q&A moderated by Murtaza Jafferjee, CEO of JB Securities ltd. More details could be obtained from, www.advocata.org/events

Ramadan: Chance to build yourself
Millions of Muslims across the globe look forward to the holy, merciful and blessed Ramadan which falls on May 16 and 17. With the sighting of the moon, the devotees will initiate the Ramadan fasting. The Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) used to get ready for this special month two months ahead of Ramadan because of its significance and numerous benefits. Muslims fast from dawn to sunset for 30 days with the solid anticipation of seeking forgiveness and blessings of Allah.
The 30-day period comprises three divisions. The first 10 days is for blessings (Rah math). The second 10-day duration seeks repentance for the sins committed (Magfirath). The last 10-day duration seeks protection from the Hell (Ethukum Minannar). Fasting is compulsory for every healthy Muslim though there are exemptions for the elderly, the pregnant, the breastfeeding mothers, the patients and the travellers. The real purpose of fasting is not the abstinence from eating and drinking. Its genuine purpose is to purify the soul and body of the people who fast in the month of Ramadan.
During the Ramadan, the Muslims engage in religious activities and rituals such as reciting Holy Quran, performing special prayers such as tharawi and withir to obtain the utmost satisfaction of Allah. Almighty Allah states in Hadithkuthsi, on Ramadan: The followers of Islam perform various worships for himself but fasting is absolutely for me and I myself only bestow reward for the fasting besides, Allah does not want the mere starvation of His men but He expects the pure and pious involvement of believers who fast only seeking higher ranks during the rewarding day. Allah orders his angels to open the gates of heaven and close the gates of hell and chain up Satan during the month of Ramadan in order to honour the fasting month.
Gifted month
The people who tend to commit sins during other eleven months of the year intentionally get ready to fast and make themselves free from committing sins during the month of Ramadan. Once, the Prophet climbed the steps to make a sermon on Friday. He said Amen when the Jibreel (Ali), the leader of all Angels, stated that those who had the opportunity to fast in the Ramadan and failed to obtain forgiveness for his sins from almighty Allah would go to hell.
The Muslims, fasting in Ramadan, should be patient, avoid getting angry and should refrain from speaking lies, backbiting, speaking ill of others, making false promises, looking at women with lustful thoughts, mouthing foul, unnecessarily quarrelling with others and forming nasty and suspicious ideas about other people. Such acts will nullify the real intention of Ramadan. Muslims should genuinely involve in charity (sadaqua) and take a solitary position to plead with Allah for forgiveness for the sins committed in the past.
Practically speaking, the people tend to waste away their precious time in this gifted month. They watch television, engage in idle talk and play various indoor games such as carom and chess. In fact, this will not bring any reward from Allah. Quite the contrary, these will erode away our good deeds and finally make us bankrupt on the doomsday.
Muslim fraternity
The Muslims should pray five times during the Ramadan period. The fasting is only the fourth pillar of Islam while the prayer is the second pillar. The rewards are multiplied for prayers during the blessed period of Ramadan. When a Muslim performs (Nafeel prayers) normal prayers, he will get the benefits of (Farl Prayers) compulsory prayers. The Farl Prayer is 70-fold greater than the prayers performed during an ordinary period. This month has also been recognised and respected by Muslims owing to the night of power (Lailathul Qadr). It is greater than thousand months. It lies hidden in the odd nights of the last ten days of Ramadan in which the Almighty Allah revealed the Holy Quran to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
The Muslim fraternity must realise the meritorious power of this month and strive to obtain the maximum benefits. No one can assure of our existence next year. Perhaps this may be our last Ramadan. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) also said that two significant things will intercede for us from Allah in the doomsday. First, it is the Quran that we recited during our lifespan. Second is the fasting.
Allah has created a special entrance (Entrance of Raiyan) through which only the people who fasted will enter the heaven. Considering the benefits and uniqueness of this blessed period, the Muslims should utilize every single minute to seek spiritual satisfaction. Some quarters idle around on the roads, at night-time, disturbing the people fast asleep. The fraternity shall refrain from such nefarious activities. The parents shall keep the children from wasting their precious time on the road. The children should be guided on capitalising on the precious time. They can make use of the precious time by reciting Quran or engaging in thikkr or prayers.
The spiritual practice will benefit us during the Ramadan.

Sorghum thrives in dry zone
The National Food Production Programme (NFPP) launched by President Maithripala Sirisena has been a method to seek solutions to the grave economic issues faced by the farming community in Sri Lanka.
Its aim was to increase agricultural production in the midst of low farmer incomes. In the last few years, drought, floods and other natural disasters have ravaged farmlands in the country. Last year, floods had a drastic impact on paddy cultivation and thus the NFPP recommended that sorghum be planted instead. Today the sorghum cultivation is thriving.
Sorghum farming
The national programme conducted under the Presidential Secretariats Thirasara Samwardanaya (Sustainable Development) unit focuses on reaching agricultural self-sufficiency in potatoes, big onions, chillies, sorghum and soya bean.
The Nawagaththegama Divisional Secretariat and Anamaduwa Divisional Secretariat in the Puttalam District, Agriculture Department, Agrarian Services Development Department and Ceylon Agro Industries (CAI) (Prima company) have come together to conduct a programme to increase sorghum production.
H.M. Gunawardana, a farmer in Maha Ussawa, said he planted groundnut and sorghum on 1.5 acres of land.
Sorghum can be cultivated on the uplands during the Maha season, both in the dry and arid zones as well as in the intermediate zones of the country. In the Yala season, supplementary irrigation may be needed, depending on the rainfall received. The Inginimitiya Reservoir supplies water for production and there is also the potential to fit in sorghum soon after the Maha crop is harvested, on the upland chena lands as an intermediary crop, to catch the inter-monsoonal rains. After reaping the harvest, the Prima company purchases our harvest for Rs. 7.50 per kilogramme of sorghum. The government gives us Rs. 10,000 for fertilizer. The dried sorghum seeds in the meantime can be sold for Rs. 45 per kilogramme. We receive many benefits from the sorghum cultivation, said Gunawardana.
R.M. Keerthirathne who farmed on three acres of land said some of his lands were cultivated as divisional systems (bethmakramaya).
We received Rs. 15,000 in subsidies for fertilizer. It was deposited in my bank account, he said.
A lot of effort was put in to prepare the ground and we paid Rs. 7,000 for the tractors to loosen the soil. The Irrigation Department officers, Prima company officers and Agriculture Department officers instructed us on the best methods to cultivate sorghum. We harvested the crop 70 days later, he explained.
Crop insurance support
Given the series of natural disasters faced by farmers over the last few years, the government in 2016 introduced a crop insurance scheme for paddy. In 2017, this was further expanded to cover five other crops.
Agriculture research officer R.M.P. Ranatunga said most agricultural lands by now have come under the insurance scheme. We pay compensation up to Rs. 10,000 per acre. So in total, an insurance of Rs. 40,000 would be given to each farmer. In the event of a natural disaster, an additional Rs. 500 will be given, he said.
Water issues
The Chairman of the Farmers Association in the area, K.A.B. Abeykeerthi said that earlier some private companies introduced different plants which had resulted in many farmers suffering losses.
At first we were reluctant, but then with time we were able to grow sorghum. I request the authorities to inquire into the Deduru Oya irrigation project. We dont have drinking water. We purchase bottled water for drinking and I request you to provide one water tank for each village. In addition, we would also appreciate if duty on imported machinery was reduced.
He also brought up the issue of a lack of local seeds for farming.
Divisional Irrigation Engineer Pushpakumara, in the meantime, explained that the water capacity of the Inginimitiya reservoir was about 10,700 acre feet and that they last released water from the reservoir in May 2016.
At present, however, the water capacity of the reservoir stood at 8,000 acre feet. The water supply for the reservoir comes from Deduru Oya and at the start of the sorghum cultivation project, the water was at 11,700 acre feet and over the cultivation period, 5,000 acre feet water had been released for cultivation.
Resident project manager Jayantha Kumara said the Inginimitiya reservoir project was the largest project in Puttalam. Its water capacity was about 58,000 acre feet and this was supplied to the Anamaduwa, Karuwalagaswewa, Nawagaththegama and Kotavihara divisions.
There are 8,000 acres of crop lands and we faced many issues over the last three seasons due to the change in weather. The Presidential Secretariat introduced sorghum seeds to farmers and the farmers have cultivated 900 acres of land. This includes vegetables and groundnut, explained Kumara.
He further explained that sorghum was a sun-loving plant and many farmers preferred to grow it since it was a hardy crop, able to thrive under diverse climatic and soil conditions.
More importantly, it was most suited to the hot, dry and arid districts of the country and required less water than even maize.
It is better able to survive drought conditions where it remains dormant for some time and grows when moisture is available. Due to the vigorous and deep root system it develops, it is able to extract water from deep soils. With good management, most varieties can be harvested in as little as 70 days.
Private sector involvement
The CAI has supported chena farmers with a package including high-quality seeds, fertilizer, farming advice and, most importantly, a buy back guarantee for the crop. The company has also provided assistance through facilitating credit to farmers at low interest through banks and a crop insurance scheme.
The sorghum farmers who took advantage of the CAI farmer programmes over the years are now enjoying a better standard of living while simultaneously contributing to the increased sorghum production in the country.
With these facilities and other support, including improved technology provided by company field extension staff, farmers have been able to double their yields of sorghum. Average yields have been reported to have reached over 5 metric tonnes per hectare. Over the following years, the technology introduced by the CAI was adopted by farmers in all the dry zone districts of Sri Lanka. Last year, more than 50,000 hectares of sorghum were grown by over 60,000 farmer families with seeds supplied by the company during the last Maha season alone, constituting 80 percent of the entire crop grown in the country.
Recently the NFPP organised an exhibition on agricultural machinery at the Puttalam Maha Ussawa with machinery and implements also distributed to farmers at the event.
Additional Secretary at the Presidential Secretariat, Jayanatha Wijerathne, former provincial council member Ananda Sarath Kumara, district secretaries, Irrigation Department officers, Agriculture Department officers, Agrarian Services Development Department officers, members of the Prima Company and farmers participated in the event.

Sri Lankan and Palestinian diplomats criticise US embassys move to Jerusalem
As the United States moved its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem yesterday, high-level diplomats in Sri Lanka spoke out condemning the decision.
The new Nakba that we have today is the shifting of the American embassy to our capital, Jerusalem, said Zuhair Mohammad Hamdallah Zaid, the Ambassador of the State of Palestine to Sri Lanka.
The Americans move coincided with the 70th anniversary of Israel declaring independence, which Palestinians regard as Nakba Day, or the Day of Catastrophe.
Thousands of Palestinians protested at the border to oppose the embassy change on Monday, and by Monday evening news outlets were reporting that Israeli forces had killed over 40 people with live ammunition.
So what is this democracy (the Israelis) practice, Ambassador Zaid said, speaking at a press conference at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute.
Palestinians  should have the freedom to live independently, in dignity and freedom, and (have) the right of return of refugees to their homeland from which they were ethnically cleansed, he said.
Foreign Affairs State Minister Vasantha Senanayake said Sri Lanka would always stand in solidarity with Palestine. In 1948, nobody took too much time in recognizing Israel as an independent state, he said. It is quite ironic that the people who were there before that are still not recognised by some countries as a sovereign state.
Sri Lankas point of view has always been that Palestine must be recognised as a sovereign country by the whole world, he added.
Citing the fact that Palestines claim to East Jerusalem as a capital has for years been condition in peace talks, State Minister Senanayake said the Americas decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israels capital would only cause more strife.
He said that the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem, an area that Sri Lanka has always maintained should belong to the cultural heritage of both Palestine and Israel was insensitive, boorish, and arrogant.

Misappropriation of Rs. 4 m public funds
Statements ordered from main suspects
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne ordered the Financial Crimes Investigating Department (FCID) to record statements from former President Mahinda Rajapaksas Chief of Staff Gamini Sedara Senarath and Neel Bandara on misappropriating Rs. 4 billion of public funds when the case was taken for hearing yesterday at the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court.
Previously, the FCID informed court that in 2012, the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, Employees Provident Fund and Litro Gas Company, with the approval of the Cabinet, had set apart Rs. 18.5 billion for the Kollupitiya Grand Hyatt Regency Hotel project.
Of this sum, the suspects had illegally invested Rs. 4 billion in the Hambantota Hyatt Regency Hotel project thereby misappropriating the government funds creating a shortage of funds for the Kollupitiya hotel project. Further magisterial inquiry was fixed for August 8.

Story behind those creepy faces  in the Truth or Dare
The movie Truth or Dare follows a group of college students forced to play the game after a curse follows them home from spring break.
But if youve seen trailers for the thriller starring Lucy Hale, you may know the movie for the wide-eyed, creepy smiling faces seen in every teaser.
In the movie, the faces are the result of a demon who makes the players hallucinate and see altered versions of friends and strangers. Theyre extremely creepy to look at and the actors themselves didnt even know just how creepy they were until after filming was complete.
You know, when we were filming, I think, Jeff, our director, had an idea of what he wanted the face to look like, but the actors didnt really know [what it would be], Lucy Hale told Insider of the demonic faces. We were just told to smile really big and put our chin down and they were going to do the rest in effects and CGI later.
Theres a line in the movie where Hales character, Olivia, actually refers to look as messed up Snapchat filters. Hale says that line was added later as a result of the stars reactions to the faces in real time. Insider

From crisis to sustenance  Part 25:
Strategy is not just beating your competition, its about winning the hearts of chosen customers
Business is a game and only the team with the best players will win. To beat the competition will require everyones collective effort. It is not just a task for the marketing department or top management; it is everyones responsibility. So, as one of the marketers of your business, it is very important that you enlist the support of the whole organization once you are agreed on the strategies to adopt in dealing with your competition.
In a business sense, a strategy is a set of related actions that a business takes to increase its performance in a particular field. In the case of marketing strategy, it is about how to win the hearts of chosen customers. It is not just beating the competition.
Competitive advantage
If a companys strategies make use of the attributes that allow a company to outperform its competitors, it is said to have a competitive advantage. A competitive advantage must be difficult, if not impossible, to duplicate. If it is easily copied or imitated, it is not considered a competitive advantage.
Here are few examples of competitive advantage: (1) Access to natural resources that are restricted to competitors, (2) Highly skilled labor, (3) A unique geographic location, (4) Access to new or proprietary technology, (5) Ability to manufacture products at the lowest cost, (6) Brand image recognition.
Strategies
There are three strategies for establishing a competitive advantage: (1) Cost Leadership, (2) Differentiation, and (3) Focus (Cost-focus and Differentiation-focus).
#1 Cost Leadership: In a cost leadership strategy, the objective is to become the lowest-cost producer. This is achieved through large-scale production where companies can exploit economies of scale. If a company is able to utilize economies of scale and produce products at a cost lower than competitors, the company is then able to establish a selling price that is unable to be replicated by companies. Therefore, a company adopting a cost leadership strategy would be able to reap profits due to its significant cost advantage over its competitor
#2 Differentiation: In a differentiation strategy, a companys products or services are differentiated from that of its competitors. This can be done by delivering high-quality products or services to customers or innovating products or services. If a company is able to differentiate successfully, the company would be able to set a premium price on its products or services.
#3 Focus: In a focus strategy, a company focuses its product or services towards a narrow target market segment. This strategy is successful if customers have different needs and want and the company is able to successfully create products/services that can cater to these customers. The focus strategy also has two variants; (1) Cost-focus: Lowest-cost producer in a narrow market segment, (2) Differentiation-focus: Differentiated products/services in a narrow market.
Here are two great marketplace examples of competitive advantage.
(1) McDonalds main competitive advantage relies on a cost leadership strategy. The company is able to utilize economies of scale and produce products at a low cost and as a result, offer products at a lower selling price than that of its competitors. (2) Amazon has 70% market share of physical book sales online. Their twin competitive advantages are their huge customer base and their mastery of logistics. The near flawless, certainly industry-leading, logistical performance has been a key from the beginning.
Business model
If a company has a sustained competitive advantage, it is likely to gain market share from its rivals, and thus grow its profits more rapidly than those of rivals. The key to understanding competitive advantage is appreciating how managers pursue different strategies over time and create activities that fit together to make a company unique or different from its rivals and able to persistently outperform them.
This is where the concept of Business Model comes into existence. A business model is a kind of mental model, prepared by the managers of how the various strategies (with capital investments made by a company) should fit together to generate above-average profitability and profit growth.
A business model encompasses the totality of how a company will: (1) Select its customers, (2) Define and differentiate its product offerings, (3) Create value for its customers, (4) Acquire and keep customers, (5) Produce goods or services, (6) Deliver effectively those goods and services to the market, (7) Organize activities within the company, (7) Configure its resources, (8) Achieve and sustain a high level of profitability, (9) Grow the business over time.
It is important to recognize that in addition to its business model and marketing strategies, a companys performance is also determined by the characteristics of the industry in which it competes. Different industries are characterized by different competitive conditions.
In some, demand is growing rapidly, and in others it is contracting. Some might be beset by excess capacity and persistent price wars, others by excess demand and rising prices. In some, technological change might be revolutionizing competition. Others might be characterized by a lack of technological change.
Characteristics
Managers are the lynchpin in the strategy-making process. It is individual managers who must take responsibility for formulating strategies to attain a competitive advantage and for putting those strategies into effect.
One of the key strategic roles of both general and functional managers is to use all their knowledge, energy, and enthusiasm to provide strategic leadership for their subordinates and develop a high-performing organization.
There are 6 key characteristics of good strategic leaders that do lead to high performance:
(1) Vision, eloquence and consistency: Strong strategic leaders seem to have a clear and compelling vision of where the organization should go, are eloquent enough to communicate this vision to others within the organization in terms that energize people, and consistently articulate their vision until it becomes part of the organizations culture.
(2) Commitment: Strong leaders demonstrate their commitment to their vision and business model by actions and words, and they often lead by example.
(3) Being well informed: Effective strategic leaders develop a network of formal and informal sources who keep them well informed about what is going on within their company.
(4) Willingness to delegate and empower: High-performance leaders are skilled at delegation. They recognize that unless they learn how to delegate effectively, they can quickly become overloaded with responsibilities. They also recognize that empowering subordinates to make decisions is a good motivation tool and often results in decisions being made by those who must implement them. At the same time, astute leaders recognize that they need to maintain control over certain key decisions.
(5) Shrewd use of power: Effective leaders tend to be very shrewd in their use of power. They must often play the power game with skill and attempt to build consensus for their ideas rather than use their authority to force ideas through; they must act as members of a coalition or its democratic leaders rather than as dictators.
(6) Emotional intelligence: Emotional intelligence is a bundle of psychological attributes that many strong and effective leaders exhibit:
 Self-awareness - the ability to understand ones own moods, emotions, and drives, as well as their effect on others,
 Self-regulation - the ability to control or redirect disruptive impulses or moods, that is, to think before acting,
 Motivation - a passion for work that goes beyond money or status and a propensity to pursue goals with energy and persistence,
 Empathy - the ability to understand the feelings and viewpoints of subordinates and to take those into account when making decisions
 Social skills - friendliness with a purpose
Leaders who possess these attributes exhibit a high degree of emotional intelligence. They tend to be more effective than those who lack these attributes.
Formulation
We can now turn our attention to the process by which managers formulate and implement strategies. This process has five main steps:
1. Select the corporate mission and major corporate goals.
2. Analyze the organizations external competitive environment to identify opportunities and threats.
3. Analyze the organizations internal operating environment to identify the organizations strengths and weaknesses.
4. Select strategies that build on the organizations strengths and correct its weaknesses in order to take advantage of external opportunities and counter external threats. These strategies should be consistent with the mission and major goals of the organization. They should constitute a viable business model.
5. Implement the strategies.
Components
The first component is the task of analyzing the organizations internal environment and then selecting appropriate strategies. The action is two-fold. As the first step, such issues as identifying the quantity and quality of a companys resources and capabilities and ways of building unique skills and company-specific competencies are considered.
Second step includes taking actions consistent with the selected strategies of the company at the corporate and functional levels, allocating roles and responsibilities among managers (typically through the design of organization structure), allocating resources (including capital and money), setting short-term objectives, and designing the organizations control and reward systems.
The second component of the strategic management process is an analysis of the organizations external operating environment. The essential purpose of the external analysis is to identify strategic opportunities and threats in the organizations operating environment that will affect how it pursues its mission. Three interrelated environments should be examined at this stage: the industry environment in which the company operates, the national environment, and the wider socioeconomic environment.
The third component of strategic thinking requires the generation of a series of strategic alternatives, or choices of future strategies to pursue, given the companys internal strengths and weaknesses and its external opportunities and threats. Its central purpose is to identify the strategies that will create the business model that will best align, fit, or match a companys resources and capabilities to the demands of the environment in which it operates.
The End Note - The strategic planning is always ongoing; it never ends. Once a strategy has been implemented, its execution must be monitored to determine the extent to which strategic goals and objectives are actually being achieved and to what degree competitive advantage is being created and sustained.
