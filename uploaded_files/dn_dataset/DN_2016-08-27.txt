West Ham knocked out of Europa League
PARIS, THURSDAY: English Premier League club West Ham suffered a shock defeat by Romanian side Astra Giurgiu on Thursday that saw them knocked out of the Europa League in a mirror image of last season's campaign.
Slaven Bilic's side had left the tie in the balance after a disappointing 1-1 away draw a week ago and that result came back to haunt them as Astra took the lead on the stroke of half-time through Filipe Teixeira.
West Ham were guilty of slack defending as Daniel Niculae found Teixeira free in the box with the striker rolling the ball past Darren Randolph.
That was enough to hand the Romanians a 2-1 victory on aggregate, mirroring Astra's 4-3 win over the Hammers at the same stage of Europe's second-tier club competition last season, a hammerblow for West Ham fans hoping to see more European football at the club's new Olympic Stadium base.
In other results, French side Saint-Etienne endured a torrid final 45 minutes at stade Geoffroy-Guichard after goalkeeper Stephane Ruffier was sent off on the stroke of half time for punching Beitar Jerusalem striker Itay Shechter.
The Israeli striker had collided with the French keeper with his studs showing in a seemingly genuine attempt to play the ball and Les Verts Ruffier was appropriately sent off for his reaction.
Despite the red carding, Christophe Galtier's side were never really under threat and saw out a 0-0 draw to progress to the group stages of the Europa League after winning 2-1 in Israel.
Italian side Sassuolo, who finished sixth in Serie A last year, qualified for the first time in their history for a European competition after a lacklustre 1-1 draw against Serbia's Crvena Zvezda. The Italians had done the bulk of the work last week, winning 3-0 at home.
Belgian side Anderlecht were another high profile team to progress to the next round after they despatched Salvia Prague 3-0 to complete a 6-0 aggregate win.
Greek side Panathinaikos also advanced to the competitions group stage after a 1-1 draw against Danish side Brondby. The Greeks had won the 1st leg 3-0 giving them an overall win of 4-1 on aggregate.
Turkish side Fenerbahce logically advanced to the group stages after outclassing Swiss outfit Grasshoppers. The Turks scored two second half goals through Fernandao and Miloslav Stoch to guarantee qualification. AFP

Serena shoulders burden of history at US Open
NEW YORK, FRIDAY: Serena Williams once again arrives at Flushing Meadows poised to rewrite the tennis record books -- if her own troublesome right shoulder and increasingly emboldened rivals allow.
The 34-year-old US superstar matched Steffi Graf's Open Era record of 22 Grand Slam singles titles with her triumph at Wimbledon in July.
With a seventh US Open triumph she can break Graf's record, and continue her march toward Australian Margaret Court's all-time mark of 24 Grand Slam titles.
She could also break Graf's record of 186 consecutive weeks atop the world rankings, and surpass Chris Evert for most US Open singles titles won in the Open Era. But after seeing a frustrating year go by between her 21st Grand Slam win and No. 22, Williams said she'd learned to let history take care of itself.
I learned not to get involved in those debates and conversations, Williams said after her straight-sets victory over Angelique Kerber in the Wimbledon final.
I definitely had some sleepless nights ... I've just felt a lot of pressure.
When the final Grand Slam of the year gets underway on Monday, the pressure could be on again.
Williams's bid to retain her Olympic singles title ended in Rio de Janeiro this month when she was sent crashing out of the third round by Elina Svitolina. Williams was clearly hindered by the shoulder injury that had forced her out of the Montreal WTA tournament as she served up eight double faults and 37 unforced errors in the straight-sets defeat. Since then she has withdrawn from her WTA title defence in Cincinnati, saying the inflammation in her shoulder continues to be a challenge. If Williams isn't at full strength, Kerber is just one of the players poised to pounce.
Kerber closing in
The German defeated Williams in the Australian Open final in January. Seeded second in New York, she is one of three players with a chance to seize the number one ranking if Williams falters.
Kerber, 28, boasts a title at Stuttgart, an Olympic silver medal and finals appearances at Brisbane in January and this month in Cincinnati -- where she missed her first chance to supplant Williams atop the rankings.
Being viewed as a legitimate threat to Williams, Kerber said, is really special.
Because Serena is one of the best players and athletes in the world, she said. Of course it's really special that a lot of people are speaking about her and then speaking about me.
Third-seeded Spaniard Garbine Muguruza also has a shot at the top, although the 22-year-old who stunned Williams in the French Open final will need her best US Open ever to do so.
In three main-draw appearances she has won just one match. Turning around her Flushing Meadows fortunes would further her aim of establishing herself as more than the girl that beat Serena at Roland Garros. I want to really do well there, the Spaniard said. Hopefully this is the year. Fourth-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland also has an outside chance at the world number one ranking if she can claim her first Grand Slam title.
Like Radwanska, Romanian fifth seed Simona Halep is seeking a Grand Slam breakthrough while sixth-seeded Venus Williams, who counts two US Open victories among her seven Grand Slam singles titles, is one of a handful of former champions among the seeds.
That includes 2004 winner Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia and Australian Samantha Stosur -- who toppled Serena in the 2011 final. Last year's US Open champion Flavia Pennetta of Italy will not defend her title after retiring at the end of last year. AFP

England to go ahead with Bangladesh tour
LONDON, THURSDAY: England are to go ahead with their tour of Bangladesh, the England and Wales Cricket Board confirmed Thursday.
We can confirm that @englandcricket's tour of Bangladesh will continue as planned, said a statement on the ECB's official Twitter feed.
The future of the tour was thrown into doubt when an attack in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, saw 20 hostages killed, including nine Italian citizens, with the Islamic State group claiming responsibility.
An ECB delegation led by security adviser Reg Dickason, accompanied by director of cricket operations John Carr and David Leatherdale of the Professional Cricketers Association recently visited Bangladesh to make their own security assessment.
Following their return, the ECB said Thursday that the three one-day internationals and two Tests which England are due to play in Bangladesh in October and November before heading to India were set to go ahead as scheduled.
England players -- including Test captain Alastair Cook and One-Day captain Eoin Morgan -- received a briefing Thursday from longstanding security chief Dickason, accompanied by ECB director of cricket Andrew Strauss, Leatherdale and Carr, as well as Tom Harrison, the ECB chief executive.
Safety paramount
Following the meeting Strauss, a former England captain, said: England's tour of Bangladesh will continue as planned.
Safety and security of players and management are always paramount. We've received a thorough risk assessment, had excellent insight into the current situation and been fully briefed on security commitments.
The ECB and PCA have the utmost confidence in the advice and support we've been given.
Strauss added that details had been discussed with the players and management in an open meeting Thursday.
They asked lots of questions, have time to ask more and will clearly want to take it all in -- we understand that.
Selection for the tour will be made after the end of the (English) summer internationals (in September), he said. England are due to arrive in Bangladesh on September 30, with their schedule also including three warm-up matches. One before the ODIs and two ahead of the Tests.
They are set to leave Bangladesh on November 2 ahead of a five-Test series in India starting the following week.
We will, as always, continue to monitor the situation right up to and throughout the tour, Strauss said.
Australia cancelled their tour of Bangladesh in October for security reasons and then withdrew their side from the Under-19 World Cup in the country at the start of this year.
England, however, fielded a team at the youth tournament.
Current advice from Britain's Foreign Office states there is a heightened threat of further terrorist attacks in Bangladesh, although similar assessments could be made of a number of countries.
Dealing with security threats has long been an issue for cricket, as it has been for other major sports and entertainment events.
England's 1972/73 tour of India saw a team captained by Tony Lewis receive death threats from the Black September group responsible for the murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics.
However, England's tour passed off without major incident.
More recently, the England team at the 2003 World Cup in southern Africa refused to play in Zimbabwe citing concerns over player safety -- a decision that contributed to a failure to get out of the group stage.
Five years later an England team captained by Kevin Pietersen and featuring opening batsman Strauss returned to India for a Test series whose future had been called into question by the Mumbai terror attacks.
Last week James Anderson, England's all-time leading wicket-taker, expressed the team's confidence in Dickason's judgement as he went about his fact-finding mission in Bangladesh.
Reg is brilliant at his job and he's looked after us for the best part of 10 years and David is there with the PCA, said Anderson, also a member of England's 2003 World Cup squad.
We trust their ability to see what the safety is like. AFP

Swimmer Lochte charged over false robbery claim
RIO DE JANEIRO, THURSDAY: The Brazilian authorities have charged US swimming star Ryan Lochte with making a false statement about being robbed at gunpoint during the Olympics, police said Thursday.
The 32-year-old gold medal-winner risks a jail sentence, Brazilian media quoted a police official as saying, although the judicial authorities had yet to confirm that.
Ryan Lochte was charged with the crime of falsely reporting a crime, police said in a statement, adding that the case had been referred to the courts.
The police statement said they had recommended the courts issue a summons for Lochte to be questioned.
Once he is summoned, whether he turns up or not, the penalty is the same: one to six months prison, the news website G1 Rio quoted police official Clemente Braune as saying.
If he is summoned and does not turn up to the hearing, the trial will go ahead in the accuseds absence until the final sentence is given.
Vandalized bathroom
Lochte apologized last week for saying that he and three teammates had been mugged on their way back from an all-night party by robbers pretending to be police.
Rio police chief Fernando Veloso later told a news conference that the swimmers were not robbed but detained when they tried to flee after vandalizing a gas station bathroom. The tale humiliated first the Brazilian hosts of the Games and later Lochtes own Team USA after police contested his story. Top sponsors such as Speedo and Ralph Lauren abandoned Lochte this week.
Im taking full responsibility for it, Lochte said in an interview broadcast late Saturday.
I over-exaggerated that story and if I had never done that, we wouldnt be in this mess.
Drunken urination
Lochte had earlier issued a written apology that was widely ridiculed online as half-hearted.
In the later NBC interview, he also admitted he was still intoxicated when he gave his initial account of the incident, adding: I let my team down.
Following the incident, Lochte flew back to the United States, while the other three swimmers -- Gunnar Bentz, Jack Conger and Jimmy Feigen -- stayed in Brazil.
Police last week released closed-circuit TV footage and other evidence about the events at the gas station.
The athletes, who appeared intoxicated, stopped in a taxi at the gas station to use the bathroom during the early hours of the morning.
Lochte and the others then vandalized the area near the bathroom and, according to the manager, urinated on the walls. Confronted by a security guard, they tried to leave. When the confrontation escalated, the security guard took out his pistol and made them sit on the ground. After paying around $50 in compensation for the damage, they left unharmed and returned to the athletes village. There was no robbery of the kind reported by the athletes, Veloso said. Lochtes claims embarrassed the Olympic authorities, highlighting security worries at the Olympics. Brazil had deployed 85,000 police and soldiers to secure the Games. Lochte could also face disciplinary action over the incident by USA Swimming and the International Olympic Committee.
One US company threw Lochte a lifeline on Thursday, however. Pine Bros. Softish Throat Drops said it would launch a series of ads featuring Lochte with the slogan: Forgiving on Your Throat. - AFP

Blatter fights FIFA ban in marathon final appeal
LAUSANNE, THURSDAY: Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter fought to overturn his ban from football in a marathon, 14-hour appeal hearing on Thursday, in a long-shot bid at redemption after his career ended in disgrace.
Blatter mounted his defence against the six-year FIFA suspension imposed over ethics violations at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which typically has the final word in major sport disputes.
Engulfed by corruption scandals since May of last year and the target of a criminal investigation in his native Switzerland, the 80-year-old Blatter appeared upbeat after emerging from the courthouse well into the night.
Its a long day, Blatter said at 10:35 pm (2035 GMT). I cannot give any prognosis how it will be decided.
He entered CAS shortly before 8:00 am wearing a dark navy suit and sporting some light stubble, telling reporters he remained optimistic and had confidence in the arbitrators.
The case that triggered Blatters downfall first emerged in September of last year, when Swiss prosecutors said they were investigating him over a suspect two million Swiss franc payment ($2 million, 1.8 million euros) he authorised in 2011 to his one-time heir apparent, Michel Platini.
Blatter has insisted the payment was part of a legitimate oral contract, a claim that has been rejected in multiple hearings at FIFAs in-house courts.
World footballs former most powerful man said he would respect the CAS decision, which should be delivered within weeks.
I will accept the verdict, Blatter said before the hearing.
I do hope it will be positive for me, but we are footballers. We learn to win but also we learn to lose, he added.
Platini, the former head of European football, was also sanctioned by FIFA over the funds.
The Frenchman lost his CAS appeal in a May verdict that likely diminishes Blatters hopes of victory.
Speaking to reporters before giving evidence at Thursdays closed-door hearing, Platini said Blatters fate may already be sealed.
Im not sure if a decision hasnt already been made, he said, vowing to tell the truth about the infamous payment for the umpteenth time.
Platini left CAS after testifying at around 4:30 pm, but made time for some mild mocking of Blatters stubble.
Mr. Blatter is a little tired. He has a beard, so Ill send him a razor, the ex-UEFA boss said.
Settling a debt
Blatter restated his claim that he authorised the payment because FIFA owed Platini money.
Platini had been hired by FIFA as a consultant from 1999 to 2002 and had apparently not received his full compensation.
I am sure, at the end... that the panel will understand that the payment made to Platini was really a debt that we had with him, Blatter said Thursday.
This is a principle: if you have debts you pay them.
FIFAs ethics committee was not convinced by the explanation, banning both Blatter and Platini for eight years in December. Those suspensions were however cut to six years on appeal in February. CAS however judged FIFAs sanctions against Platini too severe and trimmed his suspension to four years.
That outcome would likely offer little comfort to the ageing Blatter, whose four-decade career as a football broker is likely over.
Separate from the Platini case, Swiss prosecutors are also investigating Blatter over alleged mismanagement during his 17-year tenure as FIFA president.
He was replaced in that job by fellow Swiss national and former UEFA number two Gianni Infantino in February. AFP
