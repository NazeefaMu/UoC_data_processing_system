In shock following  mothers death
Elton John has been left "in shock" after his mum Sheila Farebrother died on December 4.
The Rocket Man singer announced the news on Instagram on Monday by sharing a picture of the pair smiling for the camera.
"So sad to say that my mother passed away this morning. I only saw her last Monday and I am in shock," he wrote in the caption. "Travel safe Mum. Thank-you for everything. I will miss you so much. Love, Elton."
Elton had only been back on speaking terms with his mum for a couple of years before she died. They had become estranged in 2008, when the pair fell out after Elton told her to cut off contact with two of their oldest friends, former driver and personal assistant Bob Halley and manager and lover John Reid, but she refused.
"I told him: 'I'm not about to do that and drop them. Bob is like a son to me. He has always been marvellous to me and he lives nearby and keeps an eye on me'," his mother told the Daily Mail in 2015. "Then to my utter amazement, he told me he hated me. And he then banged the phone down. Imagine! To me, his mother!"
She revealed their feud in 2015 after she hired an Elton impersonator for her 90th birthday party, sparking speculation about an estrangement.
However, Elton, 70, told the Sunday Mirror in early 2016 that they buried the hatchet shortly after her 90th. To mark Mother's Day in America earlier this year, he posted a throwback picture of them together and wrote in the caption, "Dear Mum, Happy Mother's Day! So happy we are back in touch. Love, Elton xo."

Free and open trade a must for intl business
Opening the 14th annual International Conference on Business Management on Friday, leading academics called for free and open trade in Sri Lanka.
If there is no free entry and exit of the market, we cannot have a perfect globalization, said University of Sri Jayewardenepura Vice Chancellor Sampath Amarathunga.The universitys Faculty of Management Studies and Commerce sponsored the event Colombo.
We want you all to align with us in our goal to become a developed country by 2025, Vice Chancellor Amarathunga told the audience.Harvard University Professor Patrick Mendis, the events first keynote speaker, said Sri Lanka had fallen behind neighboring countries like Singapore in terms of its economy and development.
Singapore wanted to be Sri Lanka in the 1960s, he said. Now we want to be like Singapore or Dubai or Abu Dhabi, the link between East and West. He urged business and political leaders to follow the policy of trading with all, entangling with none.
This has been the balance of Sri Lankas history, he said. The event hosted academics from both Sri Lanka and abroad and focused on the theme of corporate resilience and growth potential.
I believe these ideas will contribute to nation-building at large as well as the field of scholarly knowledge, said Management Faculty Dean Anura Kumara.

Why Jackman  turned down
James Bond  role
Every actor in his or her lifetime wants to suit up and do action sequences like 007 James Bond. And then there is Hugh Jackman, who rejected the role of the special MI6 detective because of a reason that maybe taken as something unbelievable.
According to an interview, Jackman rejected the role of James Bond because he felt the scripts had become unbelievable and craz. The actor noted, I was about to do X-Men 2 and a call came from my agent asking if Id be interested in Bond. I just felt at the time that the scripts had become so unbelievable and crazy, and I felt like they needed to become grittier and real. And the response was, Oh, you dont get a say. You just have to sign on.
Ultimately, though, what turned Jackman away from pursuing the role was the potential demands of two blockbuster roles. I was also worried that between Bond and X-Men, Id never have time to do different things, noted Jackman. Hugh explained that for a portion of his career, he worried about being pigeon-holed as an actor. But, the main reason for said no to the role was that he wanted to prove his versatility as a performer.
I always tried to do different things. But there was a time between X-Men 3 and the first Wolverine movie when I could see the roles getting smaller. People wanted me to play that kind of hero part exclusively. It felt a little bit claustrophobic, explained Jackman. It should be noted Daniel Craig will play the role for presumably his final time in the thus-far untitled Bond 25, that starts shooting early next year.

Monopoly of railway trade unions obstructing development
The main factor which placed obstacles for the endeavour of transforming the rail service into a quality service was the monopoly of power exercised by the railway trade unions. Whenever some development work is planned, some union will oppose it in an effort to hold on to its monopoly, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
Whenever recruitment is done, promotions are given, if engines and train compartments are being imported, unions oppose such endeavours to ensure their existence. This has become a common feature in the railway service, he said.
Minister de Silva said on the occasion of the centenary celebrations of the Colombo Fort Railway Station, he would request railway unions to shed their power struggle and assist the endeavour to improve the railway service.
The Minister made this observation participating in the centenary celebrations held at the Colombo Fort Railway Station, recently.
The opening of a new ticket counter, a passenger flyover bridge and the new Bastian Mawatha access road were among the main features of the celebrations. Minister de Silva said transformations seen in other sectors were not found in the railway service because it is a people's service. The railway service had a good history and a special identity. It also has a separate culture which is its pride, he added.

## Title: Cricket for most of us South Asians is an obsession
## Supertitle:

## Date: Tuesday, December 12, 2017 - 01:00
Cricket for most of us South Asians is an obsession
The hot topic these days is none other than what ails Sri Lanka cricket, with this turmoil surrounding us it is worthwhile looking at this grate game from a different angle, an angle as sharp as it could be. His views on cricket by Satya Nadella, the Hyderabad-born CEO of Microsoft, the third largest technology giant in the world. During an interview Nadella had with ESPN Cricinfo, courtesy Andrew Miller UK, Editor.
In an age of corporate jargon, baseball is the boardroom king, with curveballs and ballpark figures flying in from left-field in business meetings the world over. But for the man in the hot seat of one of the most iconic US corporations of them all, a whole different ball game has always held sway.
According to the Forbes rankings. He grew up with it, he played under some amazing captains, and ever since. He thought, even in his day job, he reflected back on the lessons learned on the dusty fields of the Deccan Plateau, in South India.
Nadellas career trajectory epitomised the American Dream. As a child growing up in Andhra Pradesh, he was pushed hard academically by his civil-servant father, though not to the detriment of other interests - as demonstrated by the three posters he had up on his bedroom wall: the philosopher Karl Marx, the goddess Lakshmi and the stylish Hyderabadi batsman ML Jaisimha, whose 39-Test record never quite lived up to the purity of his cover drive.
And so, after a childhood spent balancing a love of cricket and computers, Nadella emerged in 1988 as a well-rounded graduate (and 1st XI offspinner) from Hyderabad Public School, and went on to apply for a place at the University of Wisconsin to study electrical engineering. At the age of 21, he was embarking on a journey into the unknown.
He went to the United States right when Sachin Tendulkar started to play for India so he looked at it and said, wow, he missed the entire Sachin era of Indian cricket, he said of his sudden uprooting from the passion of his childhood.
But luckily enough, thanks to streaming, and video on demand, and sites like Cricinfo, he was able to follow his career. It was as if he was in India all through. I guessed thats the power of modern technology.
And now, here he was at Lords - on the face of it, an incongruous setting for the launch of his autobiography Hit Refresh, the story of how he rose through the ranks at Microsoft after joining the corporation in 1992, before, 22 years later, taking over the reins of a four-decade-old behemoth and setting it on a course to challenge once again the mobile-era sheriffs of Apple and Google.
But from the moment he was welcomed on stage with perhaps the most niche in-joke that has ever been uttered in a crowded room (Please put your hands together for the only person in Silicon Valley who didnt think a googly was someone who worked in Mountain View) to his referencing, later that same evening, of Don Bradmans average in answer to a particularly stiff question on BBCs Newsnight, it was clear that Nadella considers the sport of his heritage to be a vital frame of reference in an extraordinarily successful career.
Sport was one place where he had realised you are, in fact, much more hardcore, and willing to drop anyone whos not in form, he said of his leadership style. But also, youve got to know when to persist in that very crucial time, when it could make all the difference. Its fascinating to watch that. Its like trying to find a new No. 4 batsman - if you dont give someone a long enough run, theyll never make it. Or a spinner, who I have a lot of sympathy with - just because one batsman hits you for a couple of sixes, that means nothing. Youve got to get them back.(these are words of wisdom indeed since our two freshers to our Sri Lankan cricket team Dhananjaya de Silva and R. Silva should be persisted with although they fell like meek lambs to the wiles of the Indian bowlers.)
Three life lessons in particular emerged directly from Nadellas days on the cricket field. First was the importance of competing at all times, no matter how daunting the opposition may be - something that was drummed into him by his PE teacher during a schools match where he and his team-mates had allowed themselves to be intimidated by the stroke play of a visiting Australian batsman. You play to compete! he said. You must always have respect for your competitor, but dont be in awe.
Then, in another match, Nadella looked on helplessly as a talented but self-destructive fast bowler dropped a catch on purpose to make a petty point about the captains tactics. Our heads all went down in that moment, he said. Individual brilliance - while vital for success - means nothing unless coupled to an overarching team ethic.
Like the majority of his South Asian brethren, Nadella is a cricket nut. And, as for the third indelible lesson, that one relates to Nadellas own bowling.
One day I was really struggling, bowling trash, being hit all over the park. So my captain, who could also bowl offspin, replaced me, took the wicket, then gave me the ball back, he says.
I always wondered why he did that, because I went on to get a bunch of wickets in that match. I feel he did it because he didnt want to break my confidence, and I thought What an enlightened leader. I think thats true for any of us who lead organisations. We all have to make big calls, but you have to have that sensibility. One of the key things that makes people tick is confidence in themselves, and you dont want to break that unnecessarily.
Why any of this should be relevant to cricket is probably not immediately clear. But as Nadella himself points out: If you look at any field - sport, healthcare, education, public sector, automobiles - every company in every industry is becoming a software company.
Whenever I watch cricket games, all the people in the dressing room doing the analysis all have laptops, and so we want to supply the tech that drives their success. I think if theres anything you can be sure of, we will have more screens and more computers in our lives, not less, concludes Nadella.

ADB for cross-border power transmission
The importance for a country to have reliable power supply cannot be overemphasized, says the Asian Development Bank.
This was expressed in an ADB Blog posted by Director (Energy Division), South Asia Regional Department, Priyantha Wijayatunga under the headline, Taking power trading to the next level in South Asia.
ADB is actively backing these efforts by supporting projects like the 114 MW run-of-the-river Dagachhu hydropower plant in Bhutan, which now
provides reliable power supply to about 9,000 rural households and allows the Himalayan kingdom to export 750 gigawatt hours per year of clean energy to replace electricity from thermal plants in India. This project is widely considered the first certified cross-border project in the world under clean development mechanism.
An interesting variation on these traditional power trading projects are grid-to-grid connections. Instead of exporting power from a generation plant to a grid, grid-to-grid connections entail direct transfer of power from one national grid to another.
For instance, Bangladesh now imports up to 500 megawatts from India under a 2013 project supported by a US$ 112 million ADB loan. In four years, this grid-to-grid connection has significantly improved power supply and cost and reduced power interruptions in Bangladesh, where shortages were rampant at the time.
The two countries are now looking to double the capacity of their power trading arrangement financed through another ADB loan of US$ 120 million.
SASEC countries need to continue interacting at all levels to address remaining barriers to power trade. These include absence of adequate cross-border transmission capacity and lack of clarity on regulatory oversight on cross-border trade. Continuing efforts to enlighten the decision makers and other stakeholders is key in this regard.
Energy supports industrialization, especially through small and medium-sized enterprises that are crucial to sustaining poverty reduction. Energy also gives people living in rural areas more livelihood opportunities.
Meanwhile the ADB also states that achieving Sri Lankas vision for 100% renewable electricity by 2050 is a reality.
It is imperative to pursue a common understanding that a transformation to 100% renewable energy generation will have positive impacts beyond climate and the environment. It will spur overall socio-economic development as well, the ADB said in an earlier release. We also saw clearly that a 100% renewable energy target will change the way utilities operate.
Countries that lack sufficient energy resources of their own are increasingly trying to reap the many benefits of cross-border power trading.

ADB issues maiden Indonesian Rupiah linked bond
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has raised Rp1 trillion, about $74 million, from a new issue of offshore Indonesian rupiah-linked bonds. The transaction was structured as an 11-year fixed rate bond maturing in December 2028.
The transaction is the first such bond issue from a multilateral development bank of which Indonesia is a shareholder, and the first occasion for a multilateral development bank to raise Indonesian rupiah funding to support local currency loans in the same currency.
The growth of local currency bond markets is of strategic importance to developing countries in Asia, said ADB Treasurer Pierre Van Peteghem. ADB is committed to deepening the pool, extending the tenor, and diversifying the currency mix of local currency available to support our loan operations. We are justifiably delighted that this now extends to Indonesian rupiah.
Scenaider Siahaan, Director of Financing Strategy and Portfolio at Directorate General of Budget Financing and Risk Management - Ministry of Finance, Republic of Indonesia said, ADB's first bond issue in Indonesian rupiah represents an important step in bolstering diversification of infrastructure financing instruments as well as fostering development of Indonesias capital market.
The bonds, which are denominated in Indonesian rupiah but settled in US dollars, were underwritten by JP Morgan as sole lead manager.
The new issue bears a semi-annual coupon of 6.30%. The bonds were placed principally with banks and fund managers in the Americas and Europe.
Proceeds from the bonds will be mobilized to support ADB local currency lending in Indonesia. In 2016, ADB approved $1.256 billion in sovereign loans and $470 million in non-sovereign assistance in Indonesia, the banks sixth largest shareholder.
ADB is a regular borrower in mainstream international bond markets but has also led issuance in developing Asian countries as part of efforts to promote domestic bond markets as an alternative to bank lending. Overall, ADB has raised more than $27 billion from the capital markets in 2017. (ADB)

Baila beats!
The Gypsies are the Kings of Baila. They, have given Baila a Sri Lankan identity. Their songs such as Linda Langa Sangamaya, Nona Mage Sudu None, Lunu Dehi, Kurumitto, Oye Ojaye, Piti Kotapan None, and Signore have become some of the best loved songs in Sri Lanka. Melodies features Sunil Perera of the Gypsies who spoke to us about the Baila sensation  the Gypsies.
Perera believes in a force beyond his control. A force that he simply describes as a blessing.
We have always had dreams, but I believe the success we have achieved is due to blessings. You may have great talent but without blessings you will not be able to have a stellar career as we the gypsies have had. I believe 100 percent that to be in the limelight, you need to have blessings, said Perera.
Sunil and his brother, Piyal are the only two surviving members of the original line up. His other brothers left in the mid 70s and have got involved in other business activities. Due to marriage some had to leave. They are involved in different lines altogether. In 1969, as soon as he left school, Perera joined the Gypsies.
When I could not continue with my higher studies, there was no other option because I had to find something I could do. Then my father backed me up from there on, because it was he who encouraged us. My father always supported us, said Perera.
Perera insists whatever success he and his band have experienced, is again because of the blessings he has received. He says you need not do much to achieve that blessing. His father taught them what to do, but Perera believes that the blessing needs to be sustained so one can continue in life.
Signore, Oye Ojaye, Kurumitto and Luni Dehi were memorable songs that made a tremendous impact on our career and gave us an identity but you cant really pin point any song that really made our name. So the Gypsies were identified with certain songs. Before doing our original songs we did cover versions of other artistes like Western Artistes  Elvis Presley, Elton John and Beatles. But later on we realized the importance of Sri Lankan music to create an identity for ourselves. That was the breakthrough we had with Sinhala music. We are where we are because of the original versions, explained Perera.
Perera pointed that Baila is a fun oriented rhythm and here in Sri Lanka people love partying. Baila has that typical party type rhythm that people are looking for. That is why Baila is very popular.
We are coming out with some new songs and we have many songs in store. So people can listen and enjoy these songs. We are looking forward to these songs. When you have a unique idea to write a song, the lyrics will automatically come to you. You have to have a base. Chandradasa Fernando is our main lyrics writer, added Perera
When it comes to other artistes Perera enjoys listening to Rookantha, Clarence Wijewardene and lyrics writer Ajantha Ranasinghe. Of course Gypsies have put out many albums.
We do a lot of dinner dances, so you cant be playing Baila all the time, because Baila is exclusively for a certain audience. There is other Western Music we are involved in. My message to a young guy or girl who wants to enter the music industry is to try and create something instead of doing cover versions. Create something different to what the others are doing. Then you can get somewhere, stated Perera.
Perera also commented on the present situation of the country.
I feel there is a lot that needs to be done. All communities must come together and there should be that love factor. We must love each other regardless of whichever community we come from. As Sri Lankans we are one. We all have equal rights. If we think like that, this country will go far. We must bind all communities together, advised Perera.

Bats that call the Island home
The island-wide conversation surrounding dengue fever, which plagued over 173,000 Sri Lankans so far this year, often transforms into a lamentation over mosquitoesof their presence in the country, the stillwater that allows them to breed, the preventative measures that should have been taken but werent. Usually missing from the conversation, however, is an appreciation for the thingsor, rather, creaturesthat likely kept the epidemic from getting even worse: bats.
When people think of bats, scientifically classified as Chiropterans, images of pesky, spooky harbingers of bad luck usually come to mind. But these stereotypes are damaging, not just because they are untrue but because they prevent people from appreciating the many ways bats contribute to society and benefit the human species. One such way Insect control. And there are many more.
A sample Bat box.
However, without an understanding of the uniquely important ways in which humans depend upon and rely on bats, there lacks incentive to ensure the species conservation and survival. This is one of the forces which drove Professor Wipula Bandara Yapa, a leading Chiropterologist and head of the Zoology department at the University of Colombo, to write A Field Guide to the Bats of Sri Lanka. Published by Dilmah Conservation and released last week, the book catalogues all thirty species of bats known to inhabit the Sri Lankan landscape and explains in depth the reasons why people should care about the future survival of bats.
The most interesting mammals in the world
Bats are mammalian creatures which, like humans, give birth to live young, nurse them with milk, and often bring them along in search of food. After rodents, they are the most diverse group of mammals. But even more singularly, they are the only mammals ever to have evolved true and sustained powered flight.
Their forelimbs are modified to form a wing, which is so different from that of birds. The bat wing is a membrane which covers the hand and also sides of the body, Professor Yapa writes in his book.
As well, bats have effective orientation systems, using sound signals to perceive their environment, called echo-location. According to Yapa, evolution of flight and echolocation are the main parameters in the diversification of feeding and roosting habits, reproductive strategies, and social behaviours of bats. He explains that these specializations have allowed bats to exploit many ecological niches inaccessible to other mammalian groups, contributing to their diversity and success.
So far, over 1,200 species of bats have been recorded, amounting to roughly one fourth of the total number of mammals recorded at present... They have successfully colonised almost every continental region on earth (except Antarctica), as well as many oceanic islands and archipelagos, Yapa writes.
30 Species, each unique
Since Sri Lanka has the greatest biodiversity per unit of any country in Asia, its understandable that at least thirty bat species call this island home. Bats, generally, are divided into varying suborders and groups depending on an array of factors including their body, nose, and ear-type, the presence or lack thereof a tail, wingspan, diet, their roosting and dwelling locations, and more.
There are fruit bats, scientifically known as Pteropodidae, of which there are four species found in Sri Lanka. Unsurprisingly, their name is derived from their diet; fruit bats feed on the seeds, pulp, juice, and nectar of a wide variety of fruits, flowers, and leaves. The fruit bat family contains the largest bat type in Sri Lankacalled the common flying fox, or pteropus giganteuswith an average wingspan of about 120 cm.
Then there are insectivorous bats, which also get their name from their feed of choice: insects, including beetles, termites, grasshoppers, mosquitoes, and others. In Sri Lanka, insectivorous bats are represented by a few main species groups, each containing specific species under them: horseshoe bats, leaf-nosed bats, evening bats (the largest bat family in Sri Lanka), sheath-tailed bats, and free-tailed bats.
Finally, there are carnivorous bats, represented in Sri Lanka by false-vampire bats, of which there are two species in Sri Lanka. Vampire bats feed on smaller vertebrates such as frogs, birds, mice, and even smaller bats. They are called false-vampire bats because throughout history, until scientists proved otherwise, the bats were believed to feed on blood.
It should go without saying that this is just a brief overview of bat life in Sri Lanka; those looking for more details should read for themselves A Field Guide to the Bats of Sri Lanka.
The importance of Bats in Sri Lanka
Professor Wipula Yapa at the launch of his new book, A Field Guide to the Bats of Sri Lanka.
At last weeks launch event for A Field Guide to the Bats of Sri Lanka, held at the home of Dilmah in Peliyagoda, Yapa said aloud the question he knew was on many minds.
Why bats, he asked. I know theyre not the most charismatic creatures.
He answered by insisting how underappreciated bats are, especially when the benefits they provide to society are taken into consideration. According to Yapa, bats are vital to the restoration and enrichment of ecosystems, including rainforests and other key ecological habitats.
Yapa also outlined three main essential eco-services bats perform in contribution to human health and well-being, which he elaborates upon in his book: pollination, seed dispersal, and finally insect control. The first two services are performed by fruit bats, the third by insectivorous bats.
A wealth of food and drink, as well as medicines, comes to us by way of the efforts of numerous bat species, Yapa writes of fruit bats.
Many of the worlds most valuable crop plants such as avocado, breadfruit, cashew, clove, date, fig, mango, and peach rely on bats for pollination. It is estimated that over 450 economically significant plant species100 of which are edibleare known to depend on bats.
As well, he writes, Bats pollinate and disperse the seeds of more than 100 plant species used to produce food and drinks. Bats also play a crucial role in tropical reforestation. Some studies have shown that, in certain ecosystems, the seeds dispersed by bats account for up to almost 95% of forest re-growth in cleared land.
Then there are insectivorous bats, which Yapa states are the main consumers of nocturnal flying insects, unmatched by any other predator in hunting and thereby controlling nocturnal insects. Other animals which prey on insects are handicapped at night due to hampered vision. But bats are capable of detecting and entrapping flying insects due to their unique, sensory echolocation.
They also have a very high metabolic rate which requires them to consume a large quantity of insects. Generally, a bat would consume at least a third of its body weight in a single night, Yapa writes.
Thus, large colonies of insectivorous bats may result in the large-scale depletion of pest insects in surrounding habitats. Since biological pest control involves the use of natural enemies to suppress pest population densities to levels lower than they would otherwise be, insectivorous bats can potentially act as biological pest control agents.
A specific bat deserving of appreciation, especially given the spate of dengue outbreaks in the region in recent years, is also the insectivore most commonly found in Sri Lanka: Schneiders Leaf-Nosed Bat. According to Yapa, recent studies in Sri Lanka have shown that this species is a major natural predator of mosquitoes, which comprises 15 percent of the species diet. As well, 47 percent of Schneiders Leaf-Nosed Bats foraging time occurs during twilight, when mosquitoes are active.
Under Threat
Among experts in the field, there is a consensus that bats in some ecosystems fit the definition of a Keystone Species, defined by Yapa as a species on which the survival of the entire ecosystem depends. Yet, acknowledgment of the outsized role bats play has not prevented them from coming under attack. Recent investigations have revealed that up to 60 percent of bats do not survive past infancy. Today, they are considered to be one of the most threatened groups of mammals, with several species already extinct and nearly seven species in Sri Lanka listed as nationally threatened.
The threats facing bats are many. First, there is destruction and deterioration of bats habitats due to deforestation.
These activities have resulted in the loss of roosting sites such as cavities, tree holes, and foliage roosts as well as loss of foraging habitats, Yapa writes.
Bats have highly specific roosting and feeding requirements and any changes in such habitats could result in a decline of bats in large numbers.
Second, the shift in agricultural practices from traditional methods to more harmful ones, such as the excessive use of pesticides, presents a major threat to insectivorous bats. Finally, blame must be placed with humans, which Yapa calls the biggest threat to bats. Humans are not only responsible for deforestation and the use of pesticides but also often harm bats, according to Yapa, out of ignorance or without realising how important bats are for our well-being.
How People Can Help with Conservation Efforts
Fortunately, not all hope is lost. In his book, Yapa provides a few ways for us to help with rather than hurt bat conservation efforts.
He explains that since one of the main threats facing bats is rapid deforestation and destruction of their habitats, humans can try and ameliorate the situation by creating and providing artificial roosting sites for the animals. He details how to create these roosting sites, from bricks and tiles or even wooden bat boxes, in his book,
Mainly, though, he emphasizes that the key way to help bats is just to learn more about them and thereby gain an appreciation for them.
The best we can do to protect bats is to make the public aware. They will rarely harm a bat if they understand that bats are not harmful, and know of the services provided by bats and how valuable bats are for our well-being.
A Field Guide to the Bats of Sri Lanka is the 13th addition to Dilmah Conservations Field Guide series and the sole guide to all the 30 species of bats known to inhabit the Sri Lankan landscape. The book represents three decades of field research and study by the author. Priced at LKR 350, it is available at the Dilmah t-Lounges on Chatham St. and Independence Arcade, and at the Dilmah Tea Boutique at Crescat.

BCCI lifts ban on Rajasthan CA
The Board of Control for Cricket in India on Monday decided to lift the ban on the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) provided former IPL chief Lalit Modi stays away from its functioning, the Board decided in its Special General Meeting (SGM).
"Yes, the ban on the RCA has been lifted but with certain conditions," BCCI acting President C.K. Khanna was quoted as saying by IANS.
The RCA was suspended by the Indian cricket board in May 2014 when ex-Indian Premier League (IPL) Commissioner Modi was re-elected its president. Since its suspension in 2014, RCA's cricket affairs are being looked after by the BCCI.
The RCA filed a suit against its suspension by the BCCI, to which the board had asked the association to withdraw all pending cases and not to involve the cricket board in any case.
The Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) already dissolved the ad-hoc committee that was constituted to run the affairs in Rajasthan cricket, paving the way for the ban to go.

China donates another 1,000 tons of rice to Sri Lankan drought victims

Sri Lankaon Mondayreceived the second consignment of 1,000 tons of rice from China, to be distributed to the drought struck victims in the island country.
At the request of the Sri Lankan government, China has agreed to donate 2,752 tons of rice for humanitarian emergency relief. The first consignment of 1,000 tons of rice arrived in Sri Lanka in November while the second consignment arrivedon Monday.
Officials said the third and final consignment with the remaining 752 tone would reach Colombo before the end of December.
The consignment was accepted by officials at the Disaster Management Ministry in Colombo.
Speaking at the handover ceremony, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, said Sri Lanka had this year experienced the worst drought in recent years with over 1 million people affected in 11 districts.
Most of the lands affected were agricultural lands which could not continue to be used for agricultural purposes now.
He said China had been prompt in helping Sri Lanka and this donation further strengthened the strong friendship between the two countries.
Sri Lanka has been suffering one of its worst droughts in 40 years due to a delay in monsoonal rains.

Where are the voices of doves
It is already stale information that Wimal Weerawansa, the leader of National Freedom Front (NFF), has advocated that the parliament should be bombed if the proposed draft constitutional reforms receive the required two-thirds majority. But I could not help but read with alarm and concern that a political party leader in this country could say this and face no repercussion. I fully support the right to free speech but with it comes clear responsibility not to harm others or incite violence - a responsibility that should be taken seriously especially if you're a politician.
This is a clear attempt to intimidate and derail the process of reconciliation when the country has already given the government mandate to amend the Constitution to ensure Sri Lanka does not regress but progress to become a fully democratic country that respects all its citizens equally so we can flourish regardless of our race, faith, gender etc.
We must not sleepwalk back into a time of intimidation and powerless again, and it's all of our responsibility to ensure such aggressive speech against the country's elected parliament, hence all its people isn't simply accepted as the norm. I urge the appropriate authorities to investigate this in line with rule of law as such threats should not be tolerated in any country.
This appears to be an effort to stop the government from fulfilling its commitment to bring all people in Sri Lanka together at last and one must ask what does National Freedom Front stand to gain by this.
Perhaps for a country that's truly at peace, there won't be a role for a party such as this.

Crossover of MP will not reduce JO strength: Rajapaksa
The crossover of a woman parliamentarian supporting the Joint Opposition into government ranks will not diminish the strength of the Joint Opposition. She defected from the Joint Opposition due to a controversy over the allocation of seats with other Parliamentarians, Kurunegala District Parliamentarian and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said.
He was speaking to the media after he called on Most Ven. Napane Pemasiri Mahanayaka Thera of the Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya and receiving his blessings yesterday. Rajapaksa said every Parliamentarian in the Joint Opposition has been given the right and freedom to change sides as he or she wished as done when he was in power. He said all rogues of his time were now on the government side. Rajapaksa said he had no political deals with Ranil Wickremesinghe whatsoever as alleged in certain quarters. The cost of living was spiraling daily. This was a clear indication of the incapacity of the government to ensure proper governance.
Joining the SLFP was no problem for him. But since the SLFP is a shareholder of the government, there was no possibility of joining the SLFP as long as it remained in the government with the UNP.

Dont dangle your  dirty participle!
I apologise to readers for being constrained to revert to some of our earlier discourses. The reason is that there is a Language Nazi out there among you readers. So everybody, Achtung! Which when translated to Anglo-saxon from German means caution or watch out.
Yes sir, Herr Johnny Nicholas has emailed me a diatribe saying he is mortified that I have turned pure English on its head by making a mockery of it. He is certainly the pernickety type of pretender who appears to champion a lingo he knows nothing about. Pure English! How can you anoint or purify a bastard tongue How can you sulk that I have offended your purist sensibilities
First Herr Knickerless you are exposing yourself to ridicule in more ways than one. Remember there is the question of parentage. No I am not being personal and challenging your ancestry by any means. But any language buff would be aware that the gene pool of English contains among others Old Norse, French, German, Greek, Celtic and Sanskrit among a host of others.English is the illegitimate offspring of a myriad tongues, conceived over a centuries-long orgy of land-grabbing and cultural cross-breeding.
The heirs to the offspring of this linguistic gangbang, the British, went on to build an empire that pilfered over a quarter of the planet and made English the lingua franca for 600 million people or more. The baton has since been passed onto the Americans whose cultural imperialism has allowed the language to continue its acquisition of tongues.
I take it then that Herr Nick has been offended by my play on mutilated, misplaced and missing modifiers and messing around with homophones, homonyms, homographs and the like. Also my take-offs on damaging, dirty dangling participles and other messy mouthfuls he finds difficult to swallow. Right Nicky Well lets give the purist a few home truths to choke on shall we Before we dive into our mirthful mayhem, lets take a look at what writing is supposed to do. Anyone know what writing is supposed to do Hmmmyes, entertain, thats a good one. Yes, inform. Good! But what is the basic thing that writing needs to achieve. Yes! Ooh yes! Spot on! Communicate, and the more clearly the better. Now listen, Nick, if we dont communicate, we dont, really, we dont exist. We can do all we want but where is the satisfaction unless we communicate Humans are social creatures and, without communication, our existence is solitary and to some extent unfulfilling.
And for us writers, and no, you are not included in this category Nick, you nit-picking nit! Successful communication often involves choosing just the right word. English, as a language, presents some unusual problems in that task. We are the communicators. So to please the likes of people like Nick lets all repeat the Hippocratic oath of writing.
I promise to excise dirty dangling participles, to exterminate un-coordinated clauses and massacre misplaced modifiers. Great!
Although there are many purists who believe everyone should adhere strictly to the rules of archaic grammar at all times, I believe it is more important to uphold the spirit than the letter of the outmoded language laws. Of course, purists are likely to point to that as yet another sign that the world is headed for Hades in a hand-basket. And guys like Nick talk about the dictionary definitions they insist have to be adhered to at all times. To me, Collins and others on the lunatic fringe of grammatical propriety are missing the point. Because language is a means of communication, using it as an excuse not to communicate is the greatest perversion of all. What good is a superlative vocabulary, in other words, if the people to whom you are speaking to cannot understand what the hell you`re trying to say
That`s why I also believe language should evolve and grow, adding new words and colloquialisms that gain popular acceptance. To anyone who disagrees, I would ask if they still cook over an open fire and travel by bullock cart.
Let me feature a selection of side-splitting and highly inaccurate offerings to illustrate what exactly a misplaced modifier, unattached pronoun, and a dirty dangling participle are. Humour, which you do not seem to appreciate, is a most effective way of teaching people, Nick mboy! Theres humour in everything. Even in restaurant advertisements and menus such as this.
A superb and inexpensive restaurant. Fine food expertly served by waitresses in appetizing forms. I bet you are drooling over the waitresses, Nick. Ok, Ill try mending that mutilated modifier: A superb and inexpensive restaurant. Fine food in appetising form, expertly served by our waitresses. Okay, I got a little creative here, but the meaning is much clearer now, although not quite so funny.
Poster outside a jewellery shop: Now is your chance to have your ears pierced and get an extra pair to take home, too.
All the better to hear you with, my dear! Amended version: Now is your chance to have your ears pierced and take home an extra pair of earrings, too.
So what are dangling participles Sounds dirty, to you do they, Nick But really, its just another chance to laugh, and then clean up our communication. This one is from a cleaning agency: Tired of cleaning yourself Let us do it. Ooooh, kinkyyyyy! Modifying with: Tired of doing the cleaning all by yourself Let us do it. It could deflate Nicks ego:
Here another: Being flat, Lalitha changed the tyre. Oho, heres a tricky one that Lalitha appears to need one of those new bras. There are endless ways to reword this one. I am tempted to leave it the way it is. However, if you are a purist and insist: The tyre was flat, so Lalitha changed it. And another: For sale: An antique desk owned by a lady with thick legs and large drawers. Cheese and crackers, what a picture! Amended version: For sale: an antique desk with thick legs and large drawers, owned by a lady.
And this classic: Mixing bowl set designed to please a cook with round bottom for efficient beating. Wow! Nothing like beating those round-bottomed cooks! But let me amend it: Mixing bowl set designed with round bottom for efficient beating to please a cook.
And talk about sexy geriatrics: Four-poster bed, 101 years old. Perfect for antique lovers. If they are as antique as the bed, they aint getting far! Really means: Four-poster bed, 101 years old. Perfect for a lover of antiques.
Sorry to disappoint you Nick. But remember this when you deal with my writing: Because its my participle, and dirty or not, I'll darn well dangle it whenever I want to!

Dream Christmas duet with Lewis
Christmas has come early for Fifth Harmony star Dinah Jane after scoring her dream duet with British singer Leona Lewis.
The two ladies surprised fans on December 7 by unveiling their Christmas Medley, alongside a black-and-white video of the pair recording the tune in the studio, which was decorated with Christmas lights.
"I'm soo (sic) excited to share this with you guys!" Leona posted on Twitter. "@dinahjane97 and I wanted to do something special for all of you this Christmas. You're the reason we get to do what we love and we put our hearts into recording this song. Merry Christmas, we love you guys."
Dinah also shared her joy at having worked with Leona in a series of lengthy tweets, explaining how she had admired Leona since she won the U.K.'s The X Factor in 2006 - six years before Fifth Harmony was formed on the U.S. version of the talent show.
"As a little girl, I've always looked up to empowering female vocal artists such as Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, Carrie Underwood, Beyonce & Leona Lewis!" the 20-year-old began. "What a humbling experience this is for me I tell you."
Explaining how the collaboration came about, she continued, "I'm so grateful for those of you who have followed me throughout my journey & to those who made this dream collab (sic) come to life! I was just scrolling through Twitter one day and I came across a tweet saying 'Dinah & Leona need to do a song together' and Leona had faved it (sic)! I was freaking out to my mom like, 'WHAT DOES THIS MEAN MOM!! Is this a Green Light!'"
The two artists eventually got together and Dinah's dream duet was born.
"The 11 yr (year) old me in me is totally fan-girling (sic) at this point !!" she gushed. "This is the best Christmas gift I've ever received! Thank you to the fans & thank you Ms. Lewis for making my dreams come true! With that being said, enjoy this special medley we created for you this Christmas!"

Railway TUs divided
Eight unions to report back to work
Transport Ministry Secretary G. S. Vithanage yesterday said eight railway unions which were on strike have decided to report back to work. Vithanage explained that the government planned to recall all retired staff back into service, drivers working at the periphery of stations to be trained under seniors to operate as engine drivers and to recruit workers as guards.
We will not be able to return the service back to normal but we can manage to keep it going until matters are resolved, said Vithanage.
He further explained that despite all their efforts and the countrys most senior administrator, the Secretary to the President having held discussions with the unions twice, they had failed to arrive at a solution.
Fernando however stated that the unions as well as the Secretary to the President, Austin Fernando were able to reach a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on several issues during their discussions on Sunday but discussions fell apart over the manner in which the final agreement was addressed.
It was a MoU between the Secretary to the President and us. But he did not sign it thus, he merely put a note that these demands would be referred to the President. We do not just want a letter to take back to the members, saying that we were given assurances. That would be betraying the membership. We want concrete action, Fernando said.
According to the union leader, they are prepared to call off the strike if the authorities can officially agree to implement the agreement they have discussed.
We are not in a position to grant all that they demand. There are certain matters which need to be agreed to by the Cabinet. No administrator can agree to such demands. There needs to be some flexibility and there are issues and we have agreed to look into them. But we cannot resolve issues overnight, we need time, said Vithanage.
Parliament in the meantime approved the Gazette to make the Railways an essential service yesterday.
Authorities have also warned that workers who do not report to work would be considered to have vacated their posts.
In the meantime, Railway Unions Central Committee yesterday decided to continue with the strike they have been engaged in since Friday (8).
The strike which was initially called by the Train Engine Drivers Association has four unions supporting it with a total membership of 2500, according to Railway Guards Union, President Janaka Fernando.
The unions have stood firm in their resolve to continue with the strike action despite the President declaring it an essential service on Saturday in the belief that there is strength in numbers,
The government cannot replace all of us. Even if they do manage to recruit so many people quickly.How will they get our expertise overnight, asked Fernando.
Their main grouse has been the recruitment process of engine driver assistants to which there is a Supreme Court ruling. The government has pointed out to the union that they cannot change a court ruling.

Intelligent transport systems
Ending the gridlock
As cars, vans, buses, vans, three-wheelers and two-wheelers on our city roads are increasing every year, commuting from one part of the city to another at any point of the day is now becoming a matter of serious concern for every commuter. For example, this writer spends 45-50 minutes every weekday morning to drive a stretch of 5.9 km.
Mega police and Western Development Minister, Champika Ranawaka, is also a concerned person. During the past three years he was talking about this issue and has suggested a number of solutions. Mega Police Transport Master Plan is one such initiative.
Few months ago, he said that traffic congestion burns Rupees one billion worth of fuel every day. According to Prof. Amal Kumarage of Moratuwa University the economic costs of traffic congestion amounts to over 400 billion per year. This figure, he added, is 10 per cent of our GDP.
In addition to economic costs, human costs are also involved. Chief Government Whip, Minister Gayantha Karunaratne revealed in Parliament recently that 3,017 people had been killed in 39,199 road accidents last year.
Going by these statistics, it is obvious that Sri Lankas cities are facing critical challenges related to transportation.
Inter-connectedness
Over a decade ago, Bill Ford, chairman of Ford Motors, warned of a global gridlock unless each country developed a better connected, more intelligent transport system for their cities. Based on closer collaboration between stakeholders and greater use of technology, he added, the system needed, to link commuters, pedestrians, cycles, cars and commercial and public transport as part of one interconnected system. If we do nothing, Ford said, the sheer number of people and motor vehicles in urban areas will mean global gridlock.
What Ford prophesied that day has happened today, particularly to the countries which didnt take notice of the prophesy.
There is no off-the-shelf remedy to global gridlock. Instead, a mixture of solutions that enhances mobility and, at the same time, reduces congestion, accidents and pollution are needed.
Smart systems
Managing our urban traffic requires finding a balance between throughput, liveability, safety and sustainability. As our cities are expected to grow in the coming decades (leading to increased traffic demand), the challenge of managing traffic will increase, as space to develop road networks is often limited or (in some cases) non-existing.
Our urban traffic is characterized by an odd mix of different modes of transport (pedestrians, cars, commercial vehicles, public transport, two and three-wheeler vehicles) makes the challenge even more complex.
To date, all our governments have been largely focused on short-term fixes to eliminate these problems: building new motorways, widening roads, putting up signs and establishing commuter lanes. While providing temporary relief, these short-term solutions only add to the long-term problems by increasing the number of vehicles on the road and aggravating the related environmental, cost and safety concerns.
The solution lies not just in more concrete and signs, but in smarter transport systems and better-informed commuters so they can travel faster and safer  and with greater energy efficiency than ever.
future challenges
How does one optimise the use of the existing road infrastructure without massive additional capital expenditure We can identify several time-tested management solutions in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) that aim to ease both existing and future challenges facing road traffic without heavy investment.
The main objective of ITS is to provide safe, accessible, reliable, sustainable and user-friendly transport for commuters and set up a mechanism to deliver a transport service that keeps pace with growth. It is basically the use of computer and communications technologies in the resolution of transport problems.
It can help in timely gathering of data or intelligence and then providing feedback to traffic managers and road-users. Implementation of ITS can lead to reduced traffic congestion, better traffic efficiency, better safety to drivers, improved energy efficiency and increased economic productivity. Some examples of ITS include: Advanced Vehicle Control Systems, Advanced Traveller Information Systems, Electronic Toll Collection Systems, Advanced Public Transportation Systems, Wireless Traffic Signal Controllers, Red Light-Stop Line Violation & Detection System, CCTV Junction Surveillance, Variable Message Sign system and Video Incident Detection etc.
These solutions have already been adopted in a large number of countries for effective management of traffic. Japan, for example, has seen within 3 years after the successful implementation of this technology, a reduction of traffic congestion by 35%.
Thailand experience
If Sri Lanka is interested in adapting an ITS programme, one of best success stories it can study is Thailand experience. Just like us, traffic conditions in Bangkok metropolitan region and the surrounding provinces were deteriorating and becoming severely congested due to the increase in travel and transport demand which exceeded their network capacity. As a result, the Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning (OTP), after extensive research, decided to implement the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) Master Plan 2012 - 2017 prepared by the experts.
The strategy has been formulated from two approaches: (1) the problem identification process and SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) of the current transportation and logistics situations in major cities in Thailand, and 2) the roles and capabilities of stakeholders in the transportation industry, both government and private sectors.
The strategy for ITS development is divided into six areas of applications as follows:
Strategy 1: Traffic Management/Traffic Signal Control: e.g. Advance Traffic Control System at Intersections, Emergency Vehicle Priority System
Strategy 2: Traffic Information Provision: e.g., Traffic Information Collection and Provision System on real-time basis, Events Information Provision System, Route Guidance System to direct drivers to less congested routes, Information Provision System for Temporary Traffic Bottlenecks, Traffic Management System at Large-scale Shopping Malls, Parking Space Information Provision System, Commercial Vehicles Location System.
Strategy 3: Traffic Safety Assistance: e.g., Danger Warning System to reduce road crashes, Pedestrian Safety Support System, Weather Condition and Prediction Information Provision System.
Strategy 4: Public Transport Management: e.g., Bus operation Monitoring and Control System, Rail Operation Information Provision System.
Strategy 5: Traffic Enforcement Assistance: e.g., Traffic Rules Surveillance and Control System, On-street Parking Control system, Over Speeding Control System, Overloaded bus and lorry Control System.
Strategy 6: Road Management: e.g., Upgrading of Road Condition Information Collection.
Strategy 7: Toll/Fare Collection: e.g., Road Pricing System, Common Ticketing System.
For each of the six areas of ITS applications, objectives, projects, responsible agencies, and strategys KPIs were listed.
Budget allocation
Budget allocations for the proposed ITS developments in five years were determined using two approaches as follows:
(1) As a proportion of the national transportation infrastructure investment. The appropriate proportion was adopted from other areas which have proved to have a positive impact to the transportation system.
(2) Based on the economic benefits from the implemented projects and the investment cost.
Based on the budget allocation analysis, the total budget for the proposed ITS developments from 2012- 2017 were around 8,000 Million Baht (about Rs. 38.0 billion).
A new research report produced by a global IT body - GSMA Association, Building Digital Societies in Asia: Making Transportation Smarter, indicates that the successful implementation of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) in the capital city of Thailand is beginning to reduce travel times, carbon dioxide emissions and road accidents, driving social and economic benefits of up to US $1 billion per year.
Countries such as the US, Japan, South Korea, UK, Germany and Netherlands have been implementing ITS for more than a decade and have derived significant socio-economic benefits from such solutions. Given its heavy traffic congestion and associated pollution, as well as a very high traffic accident rate, Colombo (as a starting point) is a particularly good use case to demonstrate the potential of ITS.

England tourists masquerading as cricketers panned
Sydney: England were dismissed as tourists masquerading as cricketers by Australias media which turned the screw Monday after Ben Duckett was fined for pouring beer over teammate Jimmy Anderson.
Duckett was slapped with a reported 1,500 ($2,000) fine and will play no further part in the remaining England Lions matches following the late-night bar prank in Perth on Thursday.
It plunged their already difficult tour into another crisis after wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow headbutted Australian Test opener Cameron Bancroft in a Perth bar during the tourists first night in Australia. That followed star all-rounder Ben Stokes being suspended from the Ashes campaign after an incident outside a Bristol nightclub in September that led to police investigations.
England have so far lost the opening two Tests and have their work cut out in the third this week at Perths WACA Ground, where they have not beaten Australia since 1978.
These English Contiki tourists masquerading as cricketers are about to seal their places in Ashes infamy, Sydney Daily Telegraph said on its back page.
Contiki is a tour company that caters for younger travellers and has earned a reputation for attracting the booze-filled party crowd.
The Telegraph stuck the knife in further with a blazing headline Perthetic, adding: Tour degenerates into farce as rudderless Poms face whitewash.
The Sydney Morning Herald also jumped on the bandwagon, screaming Teetering on the drink on its back page in a story that said their Ashes campaign was again in disarray.
It is the third time in four months that Englands preparations have been derailed by an alcohol-fuelled incident, it wrote. AFP

## Title: Exporters back liberalization of shipping agencies - Minister

Exporters back liberalization of shipping agencies - Minister
Only five Sri Lankan companies control the agencies of shipping lines that account for 74% of the global shipping market and the market should be opened up, said Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
Speaking at the 2018 Budget debate in Parliament on Saturday, where the Budget was passed with a two-thirds majority, he said that these five companies have an average age of 115 years.
Whilst these companies have opposed liberalization of the sector, Sri Lankas apparel exporters (JAAF), the Tea Exporters Association of Sri Lanka and the Sri Lanka Exporters Association have all hailed the move to liberalise the shipping industry since it enables more competitive pricing and better services to the entire export industry.
The Minister said that Sri Lanka should not undermine the interest of thousands of export companies and hundreds of thousands of their employees, to serve the interests of a handful of entrenched shipping agency companies.
We need to encourage an environment of healthy competition that will drive innovation, service excellence, and growth. We will ensure that such competition will be fair and balanced, eliminating unfair trade practices by enacting prudent regulation.
This is why the proposal on shipping liberalization is coupled with the proposal to implement an independent regulator for the industry. We will discuss the modalities of implementation of these proposals with Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, while taking note of his concerns.
Commenting on the Hambantota Port PPP where US$ 292 million was released as the first tranche, he said the project will generate FDI, create exports and most importantly create jobs that will empower Sri Lankan youth.
By linking with global value chains in goods and services, taking advantage of the trade-investment nexus, Sri Lanka can truly fulfil its position as an economic hub of the Indian Ocean.
Minister Samarawera said that in addition to the liberalization of the shipping sector the Budget takes a similar approach to trade liberalization.
Sri Lanka has become one of the most protectionist economies in the region with an array of tariffs and para-tariffs. In addition to driving up the cost of living and the cost of doing business, these tariffs have resulted in creating an anti-export bias and diverting economic resources to the non-tradable sector.

## Title: A factual argument against total liberalization of shipping agencies
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Finance
## Date: Tuesday, December 12, 2017 - 01:00
A factual argument against total liberalization of shipping agencies
All aspects of the shipping industry except for agency is liberalized. This includes terminals, warehouse and depot infrastructure, ancillary service infrastructure, etc., which constitute a maritime hub where foreign entities can have 100% ownership. Despite this, we are yet to see foreign investments taking place in these sectors. The only restriction is the 40% limit on foreigners investing in shipping agency business which doesnt require substantial capital.
All major shipping lines are already present in Sri Lanka
The Port of Colombo is a destination for all major lines. There is also no restriction preventing shipping lines from investing in all areas of shipping industry in Sri Lanka, such as in container terminals, warehouses, depots, etc. The intention that major shipping lines will base their operations in Sri Lanka as a result of this policy change is incorrect as even now they can have their fully owned HQ or regional offices.
Port of Colombo at full capacity
Port of Colombo is currently operating at full capacity especially for deep water terminals. So even in the unlikely event that more volume is brought to Sri Lanka, this cannot be handled with the Ports current infrastructure. It is clear that the most important move for Sri Lankan maritime industry is expanding the deep water terminal capacity in the Port of Colombo.
What is required for a maritime hub
There are many other key elements which are more important in developing Sri Lanka as a maritime hub, such as building port capacity, addressing other key issues such as developing ancillary services, ease of doing business, electronic transactions, Customs procedures, promoting flag registry, legal infrastructure, etc.
Liberalizing has nothing to do with a shipping line's call to port
Control of the shareholding or profits of the shipping agency will have no bearing whatsoever in deciding to call at a port. There are many factors that determine a lines decision to call at a port. Availability of port and terminal capacity, port tariff, ease of doing business, cargo volumes, and schedule integrity on arrival, berthing, productivity and ancillary services are a few key elements.
Besides, Colombo is a relatively expensive port when comparing the Port handling charges in the region and main hubs located in Southeast and West Asia. The decision to abolish THC has also prompted vessel operators to display subdued interest in the Colombo Port, resulting in the exploration of other options. Furthermore, this decision would also hamper Sri Lankas prospects of maintaining itself as a maritime hub.
Liberalizing ship agency will not have any impact on FDI
The reason for holding back investment in facilities and the maritime hub services is the lack of a consistent policy, no attractive benefits and bureaucracy, red tape and delays in doing business. Furthermore, shipping agency doesnt require huge investments. Hence 100% ownership is not a precursor for a line to invest in infrastructure in Sri Lanka.
All profits of shipping agency will be repatriated and not retained and reinvested within the country as being done at present by existing local agents. Shipping lines will charge all owners' costs to the agency and make it a cost center depriving the government of tax revenue. SME sector entrepreneurs will lose their livelihood.
There are currently 130 shipping agents (not an oligopoly although there are market leaders as in any industry) handling 35,000 container vessels and 6,000 non-container vessels employing 12,000 who have reinvested the earning in the local economy. Foreigners from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Singapore will set up small agency offices for casual caller vessels and reduce business available to local SME agents. This will have an adverse effect on our economy.
Freight rates are determined by shipping lines based on market forces and not by liberalizing ownership of shipping agencies
Freight rates are mainly market driven and determined primarily by ship owners vessel operating costs such as bunkers, crew, finance, port charges and insurance which are the largest cost elements for ship owners. The agency cost is an insignificant component of a shipping lines cost structure.
Liberalization will discourage local entrepreneurship and build strong local shipping companies
Liberalization of this service sector without any form of investment is detrimental to local entrepreneurship and local businesses. This move also disregards the hundreds of local companies who have contributed immensely to the development of the maritime sector in this country over the years especially impacting the SMEs.
There would be no benefit to importers and exporters by way of cost savings
Every port in the world operates with shipping agents and there is naturally a cost associated with performing the specific functions of an agent. In fact, shipping lines having 100% owned agencies will apply charges which are levied globally (eg., THC) and also put pressure on the port tariff to reduce its rates.
We need to do what is best for our economy
Countries need to do what is best for their economies depending on their comparative advantage and local resources. Sri Lanka has a very mature local shipping industry. We were among the earliest nations to liberalize shipping and convert to an open economy, to develop our ports and terminals.
Local entrepreneurs set up and developed all other infrastructure to support shipping and logistics activities.
There are many industries in Sri Lanka which have restrictions in foreign ownership such as retail business, mining and tour operators as the government needs to adopt policies which are best suited for Sri Lanka and not cut and paste policies which have worked for purely trading economies such as Singapore.

Fresh milk promoted to develop local dairy industry
The government aims to develop the local dairy industry by inducing the people to use fresh (liquid) milk instead of imported milk powder. To ensure this, there should be a mutual understanding between dairy farmers and the companies. If companies purchase milk from the farmers, they take responsibility of the farmer by entering into an agreement. The legal steps needed in this direction will be taken next year, said Rural Economy Minister P. Harrison.
The Minister expressed these views at a conference held with a group of dairy farmer representatives led by Samastha Lanka Govt. Jana Sammelanaya's Convenor Provincial Council member Namal Karunaratne at the Ministry auditorium, recently.
The Minister said one factor which created problems for dairy farmers in marketing their produce was the use of imported substandard powdered milk in the production of yoghurt and ice cream. To overcome this, it was hoped to make it mandatory for yoghurt and ice cream producers to indicate in the label whether the ingredients included fresh milk or powdered milk. Initial discussions were held with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Standards in this connection. The necessary steps in this regard would be taken after discussions with the Health Ministry and the Consumer Affairs Authority.
The Minister said an invitation had been extended to all companies to join hands with the Ministry to develop the local dairy industry by launching dairy farms with local or imported cattle. They would be provided with lands owned by the Livestock Development Department or other lands to start up the industries.
When a farmer delegate requested the Minister to minimise milk powder imports, the Minister said they lowered the import tax when milk food importers requested some relief to overcome escalating prices in the foreign market. Now that the prices in the international market had come down, steps would be taken to increase taxes levied on milk food imports. Referring to the closure of some fresh milk collecting centre by certain companies, the Minister requested dairy farmers to keep the Ministry informed of marketing problems if any, so that remedial action could taken immediately.

Global arms sales up after 5 years
SWEDEN: Global arms sales increased for the first time in five years in 2016 as rising geopolitical tensions fuelled defence spending, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).
Sales by the worlds 100 biggest arms producers increased 1.9 per cent from the previous year to reach $374.8 billion, CNN quoted SIPRI as saying in an official report on Sunday night.
The growth in arms sales was expected and was driven by the implementation of new national major weapon programmes, ongoing military operations in several countries and persistent regional tensions that are leading to an increased demand for weapons, the report said.
Arms producers in South Korea, which increasingly supply the countrys military, saw the largest percentage increase among developed countries.
The spending splurge reflects fears of a potential conflict with North Korea. Sales by South Korean firms increased by over 20 per cent in 2016, to $8.4 billion.
While consumer purchases are included in the sales figures, national governments are by far the largest purchasers of arms and weapons systems, according to the report.
American firms remained at the top of the industry in 2016, with sales increasing by 4 per cent to more than $217 billion which was 58 per cent of the global total.
American defence firm Lockheed Martin, the worlds largest producer, saw sales surge 11 per cent in 2016, thanks to increased deliveries of its F-35 fighter and its acquisition of helicopter producer Sikorsky.
Aude Fleurant, director of the Arms and Military Expenditure Programme at SIPRI, said that US growth was likely to continue.
Sales by Russian firms increased 3.8 per cent to $26.6 billion, a slower expansion than in recent years, CNN quoted the report as saying.Moscow has boosted spending in order to overhaul its military capabilities, but procurement has slowed recently because of the countrys strained finances.
Its a money issue... They have been hit very severely by the drop in oil and gas prices, said Mr Fleurant.
She pointed to regional disputes, such as the standoff over islands in the South China Sea, as a major source of increased arms sales. The area is home to crucial shipping lanes, and its rich in oil and gas reserves. China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei have all made territorial claims to islands in the area. Countries like Vietnam order submarines and maritime patrol aircraft, because of what they consider Chinas assertiveness in these territorial disputes, Mr Fleurant added.

Gomez's Instagram made public again
Singer/actress Selena Gomez has made her Instagram profile public again after reportedly switching the settings to private by mistake.
The Bad Liar star hit headlines on December 5 when she blocked users who weren't already among her 130 million followers from viewing her page, shortly after taking issue with comments a reporter made in her recent Billboard magazine cover article.
However, sources tell TheBlast.com the 25-year-old didn't mean to change the account settings, and her profile was restored for public viewing once her representatives were alerted to the tech blunder.
Selena, who was recently named the most-followed person on Instagram for the second consecutive year, has yet to comment on the mishap, but many were quick to relate the apparent need for privacy on Tuesday to her Billboard rant, which was uploaded to her Instagram Story timeline.
In the since-deleted post, the magazine's Woman of the Year honouree highlighted the passage she was unhappy with, in which the writer describes how she has a "five-foot teddy bear sprawled across the kitchen floor" of her Hollywood home.
She is quoted as saying, "It was a gift, and at first I thought, 'This is so ridiculous, I can't wait until I give it away to another person.'"
The snippet clearly upset Selena as she commented on the exchange in dark pink text over the article: "Never will I let another human guess my words ever again. Or invite them in my home. That is so hurtful. The most 'ridiculous' part of that is no one knowing my heart when I say things".
Selena features on the cover of Billboard's Women of the Year issue, and picked up her accolade during the 2017 Billboard Women in Music Awards in Los Angeles on November 30.

Govt. should be open to the people - Mangala
The Right to Information (RTI) Act is important in establishing a strong social contract between the government and people, said Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday, as he appealed to Information Officers to open the government to the people.
Addressing 2100 Information Officers from the Western Province, Minister Samaraweera asked that the Officers be sensitive to the demands of the public and to do their utmost in their new responsibilities to ensure that people have confidence in the government.
As Information Officers, you act as a bridge between the government and the people to further strengthen our democracy, he said further addressing the workshop for the Officers held at Temple Trees.
The Workshop which looked to educate the Information Officers further on the RTI Act passed last year also made them aware of the need to have government offices engage in voluntary disclosure of information in order to increase transparency in the government sector.
Research conducted by the World Bank together with Verite Research had shown that whilst most government offices disclosed some information regarding their yearly budgets, the interactions government officials had with the public, especially when it came to information sharing were extremely poor.
One year and three months since the RTI Act was passed, we cannot forget the long struggle it took us to get here. Through the enforcement of this law, we have shown to the world that we are once again a strong and vibrant democracy, the minister said.
Our Ministry since 2016 has been rolling out a plan to implement the Act and to make it part of everyday use. The government has also created an enabling environment for the Act through its inclusion as a Fundamental Right in the Constitution- the first such Fundamental Right since the Constitution was passed in 1978, the Ministry explained. The 3rd Constitution proposed to be introduced to the country too would take the RTI as Fundamental Right, Samaraweera assured.
The people should be given the opportunity to find out about the workings of government within a certain legal framework, he added.

An interesting history of Ragama
Ragama, a backward region thinly populated way back in the past fifth decade with a shanty town resembled a dark isolated countryside village. The appearance of the populace looked very distressed and undergoing a gloomy period of time. I observed this situation as a brat of eleven years on a day in 1950 when I accompanied my parents to the sanatorium at Welisara where one of my grandmothers who suffered from tuberculosis was undergoing treatment. Only a few passengers with us alighted from the train on to the platform of the empty railway station and walked out to a desolate, unkempt, uninviting and noiseless shanty town which broke its silence only in an instance when a vehicle happened to ply. Though human population was less there were pigs more than the humans. There were pigs and piglets left to stray roaming in the roadside shrubby lands. Many families reared pigs for meat and earned a high income.
During this era, the countrymen lived healthy lives because they consumed only natural unalloyed food and as they were very careful about personal hygiene and behaviour. Unlike today, the hospitals were not crowded with sick people. As such, they were dreaded over the disclosure about a never heard of wasting disease affecting the lungs spreading in the country for which a definite quick curing treatment was not discovered but, was on trial like for dengue this day. In its absence, hospitalized patients who were destined to recuperate and live, lived, others departed like my grandmother after a couple of years.
It was during this period that the Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis was formed by our eminent elders of the medical profession, philanthropists and those who had a flair for human welfare considering the dreadfulness of the disease in that era. Sanatorium at Welisara situated in a quiet, shady land few metres away from the Colombo  Negombo road was the establishment where the people who suffered from this chronic pandemic disease were admitted and treated severally. Despite this healthy arrangement to put into quarantine and treat the exposed people, misinterpreted by the people of that era owing to their ignorance, Ragama Base Hospital was known countywide as the shayaroga ispirithale (cancer hospital) as a result, people were hesitant to move about at Ragama scared of contraction and those who visited hospitalized patients and obtained treatment from the outpatient department were also few in number.
Feeling of fear and suspense
Several portions of the trunk road leading to Tewatte like other roads to Kadawata and Welisara was covered and shaded by the ramification of branches of profusely grown trees and creepers spreading over the road from uncultivated lands neglected for many years turned forests hooded the road preventing sunbeam from falling hence, the somewhat dark environment during the daytime thickened with the sundown as the twilight was prevented from falling and the dim street lights of that era too did not provide sufficient illumination. This atmosphere with no houses close by and people and vehicles like this day going back and forth often created a feeling of fear and suspense in the minds of the pedestrians and felt precarious to travel alone along this road even during daytime.
The junction in this highway bordering Tewatte popularly known as Kurusa Handiya, where a cross stands to indicate the situation of a Christian shrine ahead of it is the entry point to the Basilica, the Shrine of Our Lady of Lanka. The precincts of this shrine during the earliest times were covered by a luxuriantly grown exquisite tea plantation until it was replaced by a rubber plantation for economic reasons. The well preserved antiquated tea factory used for other purposes this day stands as a monument reminding the passersby of a glorious history of a tea industry that existed once upon a time in the outskirts of the city of Colombo. Though tea was replaced by rubber, the name Tewatta (tea estate in the Sinhalese language) has put down roots.
When the rubber plantation grew up exuberantly the once well sunlit distance from Kurusa Handiya to the precincts of the shrine too became shady and dark. Under this condition, with the presence of miscreants and misfits in this junction at abnormal hours it was not safe for pedestrians to go this destination in the wee hours of a day or after fall of darkness. Yet, their professions compelled them to walk this destination from the Ragama railway station to Tewatte during abnormal hours whenever they arrived late. At this, then, notoriously known junction during the period from 1967 to 1990 the rogus waylaid and robbed many pedestrians of their possessions, molested women and escaped without leaving clues to identify them.
As the rubber plantation grew tall as the vantage point in the shrine premises got covered, the reverend administrators lost the sight of the frontage of the land from the church premises or the compound of the vicarage, they were compelled to visit the covered areas of the land for superintending purposes. As they couldnt frequent this area, their absence paved the way for the scallywags, miscreants, rogues and sex perverts who haunted the Kurusa Handiya to intrude the area of the original church. Resultantly, the reverend administrators were compelled to deploy watchers on fulltime duty to arrest this situation. It was extremely difficult to detect them unless after close scrutiny and observation as they mingled with sanctimonious pilgrims to eyewash.
As a person who lived in front of the Basilica from 1982 to 1990, I have seen the trouble undergone by the watchers to eject them. There were occasions when they were compelled to make use of their bludgeons to eject the philistines forcefully. They performed their duty with much dedication and eliminated the menace effectually and efficaciously.
Sixty-seven years after, today, Ragama is not a shanty town anymore. Densely populated Ragama owing to population explosion is not spacious enough to accommodate all and, all those who intend to settle down. It has become a dormitory town as jobseekers are streaming to the west constantly in large numbers. As vehicles from the smallest size to the largest have come on the roads and trains on tracks travelling in large numbers Ragama is affected by noise pollution. It now has a crowded and busy township but, it is the ugliest, unhygienic and stinking town in the (Colombo North) outskirts of Colombo.
Inhale polluted air
Its a town overflown with effluvium owing to stagnant and contaminated water in drains and decaying garbage strewn everywhere become breeding places for worms, flies and mosquitoes. This is the only township which is having a shrubby land in the middle of the town surrounded by pharmacies, eateries, groceries, bakers, caterers, hotels, hospitals, the marketplace and the Colombo North Teaching hospital in the background on the hilltop on to which all the muck from all these sources are dumped. The only commendable work done in this town is the establishment of the childrens park. Unfortunately, it is situated right by the side of this dump and the drain. The children who play in this park from dawn to dusk inhale polluted air. Not only them, their parents and guardians, the townsfolk too, and, all who come to this town.
It is in this environment all edible things especially raw vegetable, fish, fruit and meat are stored, stacked and sold in the open air. The hidden garbage dump hitherto unknown to the minister and the environmentalists is in the backyard of the row of mercantile buildings in front of the hospital where a high infestation of carrion crows, abnormally, the cranes which should prey on in paddy fields, lakesides and brooksides, cats and dogs, rats and rodents, flies, worms and mosquitoes live on, never leave for this landmass covered with huge trees and undergrowth has become a habitation for the wild since more than fifteen years ago.
When the dengue crisis cropped up a few months ago the visible portion of the dunghill was pushed inwards by a dozer to hide. Has this action solved the problem No. It has worsened the situation. Its a hell on this part of the earth. On dry days, there is an eruption of sudden fires probably owing to the plastics and polythene producing methane gas when mixed with earth. Then begins smoke rising to the skies emanating nauseous smell polluting the air right in front of the hospital. And, if a glimpse is taken towards the right from there, the refuse dumped by the people living on both sides of the old railway line to the quarry which provided the rubble to build the railway tracks during British colonial rule. This is the status quo.
We are not blind, dumb and deaf except for an unfortunate percentage of our brethren on whose welfare we as a nation collectively contribute through various public and private sector sponsored organisations, and, individually as well. It is sad to note that those who can see have not seen these, those who can speak have not spoken about these and those who can hear have not heard of these grave shortcomings. What have the Local Authorities, the Medical Officers of Health and Public Health Inspectors done all these years Misleading the governments, is it not
Tubercle Bacillus is not a disease to be feared of anymore as the curative has been found to be cured within six months. But, this town which is the catchment area of the hospital, railway station and the bus stands in this hazardous condition is definitely a threat to the arrangements made and is being made for the improvement of public health.
In this undisciplined era, where lawlessness prevails, misdeeds and misfeasance are rampant, misbehaviour of the misbegotten have become a hindrance to the progression of the society when promiscuity is enjoying prominence over decency, the righteous way is scornfully rejected and indecency is repeated, stubbornly and arrogantly.
Employment seekers
The ultimate objective of the church is to establish a holy family in every house. Those who intend to lead to Alter, the pilgrims, devotees and visitors are welcome to the church to receive blessings where they must behave reverently, be it on the premises or in the precincts.
With the rapid influx of citizens from other parts of the country to the city of Colombo for employment and the suburban areas seeking accommodation, we observe from since of late the appearance of strangers and wanderers and their presence in places where they should not frequent without reliable reasons. This infestation has extended up to the Basilica grounds. They may be gaining some solace by being in solitude under the shade of these trees in the holy place of worship and enjoying lustful thoughts in this quiescent environment but, if they misbehave misusing the privilege offered to pilgrims its tantamount to the misdemeanour in a sanctum detrimental to the sanctity of the holy land. They have to be warned against repetition and the deviants have to be deterred and repeaters have to be ejected.
This situation dispelled in the 1990s has come up again after three decades may be owing to the relaxation of the administrative procedures after the elimination of this menace. The concerned devotees are of the view including the opinion of Dulishan Fernando, the engineer who is a voluntary factotum closely associated with the Reverend Fr. Administrator that a Police Post at Tewatte or regular police patrolling the area could prevent these from happening. This has to be done as shabby behaviour in a holy land will be a dishonour to a sacrosanct place of worship. As the modern day youth misprision the righteous way they have to be taught about the etiquette.

KDU MBBS Degree to SAITM students - GMOA
Relevant authorities should pay their special attention towards offering the MBBS degree of Kothalawala Defence Academy (KDU) to SAITM medical students, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo recently he said that the majority have proposed to end the SAITM issue by offering MBBS degree of KDU to qualified SAITM medical students.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the KDU MBBS degree can be offered to the SAITM medical students after examining their qualifications. Qualified students of SAITM should be given a medical (MBBS) degree which is recognized by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
At the moment private medical education is not a reality in Sri Lankan soil. The government should immediately stop changing the name of SAITM and creating a similar controversial institution. The gazette notification abolishing SAITM should be issued immediately. Pre-agreed minimum standards of medical education should be gazetted immediately without cutting down any existing powers of the SLMC, he added.

Killing Galagamuwe Dala Poottuwa: Nine suspects remanded till Dec. 26

The nine suspects arrested on charges of killing the tusker Galagamuwe Dala Poottuwa were remanded tillDecember 26by the Mahawa Magistrate, today.
Among the nine suspects currently detained in connection with the incident are three Grama Niladharis.
The Magistrate also rejected a request to bring the tusks and the elephant pearls currently in the custody of courts to Colombo for investigations. 
The killing of the tusker came to light when two elephant tusks were seized at Polpithigama in Nikawewa by officers of the Panadura Walana Vice Squad recently.
The seizing of the two tusks and six elephant pearls (Gaja Muthu) shed light into the disappearance of the tusker Dala Poottuwa in Galgamuwa as a search for the tusker carried out by wildlife officials had drawn a blank.
There had been no trace of the elephant since it was last seen on the banks of the Herathgama Wewa in Moragollagama onOctober 16.
The tusker had lost vision in both eyes and had some debility on its left hind leg.
Wildlife officials and the Police later arrested the nine suspects after interrogating the persons arrested in connection with the detections of the tusks.
They also found the carcass of the tusker in the jungle.

New song was a lullaby  for his baby
Singer Andy Grammer has a special connection to his new song Always because it was the lullaby he sang to his baby daughter to get her to sleep.
The track features on his new album, The Good Parts, and Grammer admits it's a special track that brings up very happy memories of his daughter Louisiana.
"I was singing that to my daughter right when she was born, and she was still kind of crying," he tells Billboard. "Id put her in a little cart and do a lap singing that song to her.
"Its very sweet and emotionally connected to me... Ive been bumping it in the car - me and my little three-month-old, we go to coffee dates every morning and I play that song to her, its so sweet."
And there's another song on the album, Spaceships, which Grammer sang to his baby girl before she was born: "Thats like, the best bridge Ive ever written, which is comparing to the womb - which is the world before this world - and wherever you go when you die as the place after.
"As I was singing into the womb to try and let Louie know that she was coming to someone that loves her, I imagined, while I was singing to her, 'Ah, I wonder whether my mom is doing that to me from wherever she's at'
"She passed away. But thats such a cool idea."
Grammer admits the new album, which was released in America on Friday (01Dec17), features his most vulnerable and personal songs, including Smoke Clears, which details a health scare.
"It's very autobiographical, about a health scare that happened when we were on vacation in Ireland," he explains. "I fainted in the shower and chipped my tooth and looked like I was having a seizure because I hadnt slept in like, two years." New Year

NFF in deep crisis
The National Freedom Front (NFF), led by Wimal Weerawansa MP yesterday plunged into deeper crisis with the partys Deputy Leader Weerakumara Dissanayake and NFF National Organiser Piyasiri Wijenayake joining the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
They were joined by NFF North Central Provincial Council member P. B. Kumara who too obtained SLFP membership from the President.
Dissanayake and Wijenayake, two leading politicians who helped Weerawansa form the NFF, obtained SLFP membership from President Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday morning.
Dissanayake and Wijenayake addressing the media later predicted that the Joint Opposition and the political party affiliated to it, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna faces a mass exodus of members as some of the JO leaders were determined to divide the SLFP and the coalition UPFA. Although not directly alleging, the duo indicated that their former leader Weerawansa too could be one of them.
Dissanayake said, the three NFF members had decided to leave the party as they did not want a division within the SLFP or UPFA. He said President Sirisena was the most suited to lead the party and was fully prepared to back.
A large number of JO members know that we are right. You wait and see there would be a mass exodus of JO members in the near future, he added. When questioned whether the three members will contest under the UPFA banner at the upcoming polls, Wijenayake said it was too early to say but added they may consider favourably if a request is made.
He said there were several leaders within the JO fold who do not want an amalgamation between the SLFP and JO as they believed it would negatively affect their selfish political aspirations.
Dissanayake addressing a gathering in Anuradhapura recently had indicated his decision whilst calling on the public to support the mandate of the SLFP. This new development ahead of the much anticipated Local Government polls comes just days after another member of the NFF Jayantha Wijesekara resigned from the NFF.
Wijesekera, a former member of the NFF and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, had decided to resign following the resignation of the party secretary Priyanjan Vitharana.
At a media briefing, Wijesekera cited that he had decided to quit the NFF following Vitharanas resignation.
He called on progressive politicians from the JVP and the NFF to join forces with President Maithripala Sirisena.
National Freedom Front (NFF) National Organiser Piyasiri Wijenayake, fell out of favour with the leadership after he severely criticised Weerawansa over his statement on bombing Parliament.

No slowdown of apartments
There has been an increase in the number of apartment projects in Colombo and Greater Colombo areas, according to data compiled by leading property website LankaPropertyWeb.com.
Based on the certifications issued for Condominiums, Semi Condominiums and Provisional Condominiums by the Condominium Management Authority (CMA), the number of certificates issued has increased specially within Colombo city during last three years and by first nine months of 2017 it has exceeded last years total number of units. A marginal growth was observed in greater Colombo (Colombo district other than Colombo city) area.
Significant decline can be observed in other part of the countries from last year to this year so far, which shows that developers are still focusing on Colombo and its suburbs for new developments despite some new developments being launched in Kandy, Galle, Wattala and Negombo.
Average floor area in Colombo has been 120 to 135 square meters accept in 2015. There had been relatively large number of condominiums approved and constructed with lesser floor areas in 2015.
The average floor area of the condominiums in greater Colombo area is in the range from 100 to 125 square meters through studied period and it looks stable than Colombo area. The average floor area of condominiums in all the other districts range from 40 to 110 square meters.
The preliminary planning clearances have been issued to more than 3000 units in Colombo and more than 2000 in greater Colombo. Annual average clearance issued for Colombo was 1600 from 2014 to 2017. The greater Colombo average was 1000 and other districts 450. But in the last two years the average of clearances issued within Colombo has risen to 2100 and greater Colombo and other districts remained at same levels.
Hence, there are significant amounts of Condominiums that were given primary provisional clearances in Colombo City (3,094) as at 31st August 2017, whereas 2,076 units have been forward for clearance in greater Colombo and 752 units in other districts in the country.
Colombo 6 has been the most crowded area for condominiums as per the data for the period from 2014 to 2017. Colombo 6, Colombo 13, Colombo 9 and Colombo 03 are the areas with highest number of units given approval by the Condominium Authority during this period.
Interestingly more condominium constructions were given Preliminary Planning Clearance in the areas such as Colombo 04, 07 and 06 as at Aug 2017.

Writ petition against monopolization of the shipping industry
Notices issued on respondents
The Court of Appeal has issued notices on Minister of Ports and shipping and three others returnable for January 30, pursuant to a writ petition filed by Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara for Ministers alleged failure to prevent the monopolization of the shipping industry.
The court of Appeal (President) L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne made this order when the writ petition filed by MP Nanayakkara was taken up for support.
In his petition, Nanayakkara is seeking a writ of mandamus order directing Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe to act in terms of section 28(1) (a) of the Merchant Shipping Act No.52 of 1971 and declare it as an offence for any person to monopolize or to combine or conspire with any other person to monopolize any part of the trade in relation to the carriage of goods by sea to and Sri Lanka and prescribe penalties and other punishments for such offence within a period of three months.
The petitioner had cited directing Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, Secretary to the Ministry of Ports and Shipping L.P. Jayampathy, Director General of Merchant Shipping Ajith Wickrama Seneviratne and Chairman of Sri Lanka Ports Authority Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake as respondents.
The petitioner stated that by a recent disclosure of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) dated August 28, a leading Sri Lankan Conglomerate has announced that one of its subsidiaries has recently acquired 94.81% equity stake of Sri Lanka Shipping Company Ltd, for a purchase consideration of approximately Rs.4.9 billion. In terms of that disclosure, this acquisition is in line with the groups stratergy on expanding its maritime operation and paving the way for establishment of the largest marine and shipping company in Sri Lanka.
The petitioner further stated that an article published in a leading newspaper soon after the corporate disclosure revealed that as of now, this conglomerate together with another leading player in the shipping industry is said to control over 70 percent of Sri Lankas shipping and maritime services market and is seeking to acquire more acquisition in the shipping sector with a view of increasing its market share in the future.
The petitioner further stated that in the above circumstances restrictive practices are openly and deliberately being carried out in relation to the carriage of goods by sea in Sri Lanka and the largest shipping entities are monopolizing and combining and conspiring with others to monopolize carriage of goods by sea to and from Sri Lanka.
The petitioner further stated that in general restrictive practices and monopolization lead to an inefficient allocation of resources, competition being eliminated through the dominant entities setting prices below costs and absorbing those losses until their competitors can no longer survive and prevention of new entrants into the industry.
Vasudeva Nanayakkara further stated that when the restrictive practices and monopolization are permitted, the dominant entities could engage in price-fixing irrespective of demand and result in the consumers having no alternatives, inflation would occur as the dominant entities could raise their costs by fixing any price they desire and the dominant entities would also provide inferior services due to lack of alternatives.
Presidents Counsel Faisz Mustapha with Faisza Mustapha Markar, Akiel Dean and Rajika Aluwihare under the instruction of counsel Sarath Upul Fernando appeared for the petitioner.

OSullivan claims record-equalling sixth UK title
York: Ronnie OSullivan beat Shaun Murphy 10-5 at the Barbican on Sunday to draw alongside Steve Davis with a record-equalling sixth UK Championship title.
The five-time world champion struck three centuries in a high-quality final to win the tournament for the second time in three years.
OSullivans 31st ranking victory leaves him only five behind Stephen Hendrys all-time record with Januarys Masters next in his sights, where he will defend the title.
The records are great to equal. The fans have been unbelievable, the 42-year-old told the BBC, after he also moved level with Scotlands Hendry on the all-time Triple Crown -- UK Championship, Masters and World Championship -- winners list with 18 titles.
I just tried my best all week, there is nothing left, Im over the moon to win any tournament, never mind the UK Championship.
I just love playing and competing. I just cant believe Im still playing at 42 with all these grey hairs, Im old enough to be some of these players dads.
OSullivan, who was beaten by Mark Selby in last years final in York, went into the second session level at 4-4 with his fellow Englishman Murphy.
He started the evening strongly to forge ahead, only for Murphy to hit back with a fine break of 80.
But from then on it was all OSullivan, as he reeled off five straight frames, including runs of 103 and 104.
For years, OSullivan and Murphy have had a strained relationship, with sniping from both sides. Murphy had moved to end any animosity between the two before this match, but the 2008 champion failed to prevent The Rocket from powering to victory.
OSullivan pocketed a top prize of 170,000 ($227,543) for his third ranking title of the season, which gave him revenge for his defeat by Murphy in the Champion of Champions final last month. AFP

Otamendi gives City derby delight, Rooney denies Reds
London: Manchester City took a giant step towards the title as the leaders beat Manchester United 2-1 to clinch a record-equalling 14th successive Premier League victory, while Wayne Rooneys late leveller gave Everton a 1-1 draw at Liverpool on Sunday.
City drew level with Arsenals previous record winning streak, set between February and August 2002, thanks to Nicolas Otamendis second-half winner.
Pep Guardiolas side are now 11 points clear of second-placed United, who were beaten at Old Trafford for the first time in 41 games in all competitions.
Guardiolas latest success at the expense of old rival Jose Mourinho could drain much of the drama from the title race as it would take an epic meltdown for City to surrender their substantial lead.
Mourinho conceded the title is Citys, saying: Probably, yes. The advantage is a very good one.
United felt they should have had a late penalty for Otamendis challenge on Ander Herrera, but the midfielder was booked for diving.
Manchester City are a very good team and they are protected by the luck, and the gods of football are behind them, Mourinho said of the decision.
Guardiola dismissed Mourinhos complaints and told the United chief to stop making excuses.
Last season it was the same - we won here and it was the referee. Today as well. Yesterday he spoke about the referee. We are an honest team, he said. We had 75 percent ball possession, which means we wanted to play. We came here and did that. Having bossed the first half, Citys pressure was rewarded in the 43rd minute.
Kevin De Bruynes corner was flicked on and, with Ashley Young playing David Silva onside, the Spaniard hooked home from close range. Mourinhos team were gifted an equaliser in first-half stoppage time when City defender Fabian Delph made a hash of clearing and Marcus Rashford pounced to slot past Ederson. But United returned the favour with an even more farcical piece of defending in the 54th minute. Silvas free-kick should have been cleared by Romelu Lukaku, but instead the Belgian slammed a panicked clearance into the back of United team-mate Chris Smalling and the ball looped towards Argentine defender Otamendi, who stretched to fire home.
At Anfield, Liverpool had taken the lead in the 229th meeting of the old rivals when Mohamed Salah spectacularly curled home from the edge of the penalty area in the 42nd minute. AFP

Paint a Healing  Picture..!
Very often in Whatsapp groups, I see some friend sharing a joke about another community and I know its not an innocent jibe, that it stems from some hate coming from a past experience!
My father passed away five years ago, but just before he died he gifted me with the autobiography of Nelson Mandela. But its not the book I remember so much as what my father penned in the front page for me: Dear Bob, he wrote, Courage comes in many forms, but to turn ones enemies into friends is one of the greatest!
Ah dad I know what you were trying to tell me. Look you were saying beyond your hurts and insults and show that picture to those who follow. That he who has been a victim of hatred will not preach hatred, that those who have felt the pain of racial discrimination will not retaliate but will try and heal relationships so such prejudice and anger will disappear.
Photographer Nick Ut received a Pulitzer Prize for a dramatic war-time picture taken in Viet Nam. You may remember seeing it. The picture shows a little girl in agony walking naked down a country road amongst other weeping children. The childs arms are painfully outstretched and her face is contorted in an expression of terror and misery. A Napalm bomb, dropped on her village, seared off the little girls clothing and severely burned her skin.
The child, Kim Phuc, was carried by Nick to a truck and transported to an area hospital. She cried over and over, Too hot! Too hot!
Kim hovered between life and death. She required 17 different surgical operations and months of rehabilitation.
But today she paints the healing picture!
She lives in Canada and has become an important spokesperson on issues of peace. Pain never disappears, Kim says. You just learn how to deal with it.
In 1996 she was asked to say a few words at the Viet Nam War Memorial in Washington D.C. Kim talked about forgiving those people who were responsible for all the misery and suffering inflicted that tragic day. She said, Even if I could talk face to face with the pilot who dropped the bombs, I would tell him we cannot change history but we should try to do good things for the present and for the future to promote peace.
It was a message of forgiveness. She knew that her acts of reconciliation were the bricks that could pave the only true road to peace. Kim could easily spend the rest of her life blaming others for her suffering, instead, she made a courageous choice - a choice for peace.
She painted a healing picture and held it up for all to behold.
Today this world needs you, yes you my friend, to look beyond insult and injury, beyond abuse, slights and snubs and instead start painting canvasses that show pictures of healing..!

PARLIAMENT
Industry services improved, agriculture sector affected by adverse weather
Economy experienced mixed performance this year: Mangala
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the economy had experienced mixed performance during the first nine months of this year as industry services improved and the inclement weather affected the agriculture sector.
He was moving the amendment to the Appropriation Act No. 24 of 2016 yesterday in Parliament.
The economy grew by 3.9 percent in real terms in the first half of the year compared to the same period in the previous year significantly marking below potential growth prospects. The drought and flood related disturbances mainly affected agricultural activities reversing overall growth and it spilled over to other sectors of the economy as well, he said.
Minister Samaraweera said it was required to increase the borrowing limit from Rs. 1579.1 billion to Rs. 1629 billion by amending the section 2(B) of the Appropriation Act No. 24 of 2016.
He noted that domestic supply disruption, tax revision and increased prices of imported commodities caused consumer price inflation to remain at elevated levels during the year so far. In November, Colombo consumer price inflation rose to 7.6 percent and the growth of credit extended to the private sector decelerated gradually during the year as monetary policy remained tight and less accommodative.
Meanwhile, revenue collection in the fiscal sector and the primary balance of the government improved during the first nine months along the fiscal consolidation as supported by the IMF funds facility programme. Nevertheless, revenue estimate for 2017 could not be achieved due to the delay in introducing the new Inland Revenue Act. It will be introduced from April 1, 2018 and the delay dampened the economic activity which weighed on income tax and taxes on goods and services, he said.
The Minister pointed out that droughts and floods incurred significant fiscal cost with immediate relief measures and steps to control disaster destruction. He said the government intended to spend more on disaster insurance while extending the coverage to droughts so that more relief could be provided ahead for those affected by natural disasters.
Further measures are underway to formulate procedures to link up the weather related compensation to an index which reflects changing weather patterns so that government support is extended to needy people in a better targeted manner. Targeted debt service payments owing to higher interest payments and rupee depreciation made a sizeable impact on the government cash inflows. Therefore, some deviation from the envisaged budget deficit target is likely in 2017 from the initial estimate of 625 billion to a revised estimate of 680 billion. Further expanding the borrowing limit is warranted to offset the immediate impact caused by unplanned events on the governments budget, the Minister said.
Such expansions would facilitate fiscal operations and exert a lease burden on the ongoing government funded activities, Samaraweera said. The government will keep using the expanded borrowing capacity to the least possible level, the Minister said.
All para tariffs will be removed over next three years: Malik
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said the Finance Minister took some measures through the budget to remove para tariffs of over 1200 items with a road map for the removal of all para tariffs over the next three years.
He was speaking on the Anti-dumping and Counter wading Duties Bill and the Safeguard Measures Bill in Parliament yesterday,
Apart from this, substantial liberalisation will come through new free trade agreements that we are signing with Singapore, China and India. While welcoming greater trade with the rest of the world, we have not forgotten to look after the interest of our own industries at home. This is why the two bills presented today are so significant, he said.
Minister Samarawickrema said Sri Lanka was now decisively moving towards an economy driven by entrepreneurship trade and investment. Our government will create one million jobs for the youth and the only way to do this is by actively participating in international trade. We are not new to this as we were a country where trade accounted for 80 percent of the GDP over a decade ago. Thereafter, we slipped down and we are now at half of that. We are moving to a more decisive and dynamic regime by removing para tariffs or reducing duty through bilateral trade agreements, the Minister said.
Minister Samarawickrama said the Anti-dumping and Counter Wading Duties Bill and the Safeguard Measures Bill would be a measure to safeguard the local industries.
He noted that the Acts do not aim to provide protection to the domestic industry, but they are only remedial measures in the event of injury to the domestic industry caused by dumping or by subsidisation or by sudden surges of imports.
The primary aim behind these remedy measures is to re-establish fair competition and to provide the domestic industry a level playing field, he said. As part of the governments trade policy, it will be entering into bilateral free trade agreements with India and China while its negotiations with Singapore have reached its finality and the FTA is expected to be signed with Singapore towards the end of January 2018, Samarawickrama said.
FTAs with Indonesia, Bangladesh, Thailand and others are in the pipeline. Under these agreements, the government seeks tariff liberalisation while gaining market access in those countries, he said.
While these measures are taken, these bills have been brought in to provide the legal framework to go ahead strongly and confidently into further trade liberalisation and greater trade openness while knowing that the domestic industry has recourse to a good legal framework to prevent unfair trade, he said.
Railway strike is unjust: Abeysinghe
The railway strike is unjust as their issues were discussed even with the President, and an agreement was reached. Despite the agreement, the railway workers had embarked on a baseless strike, Transport and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Ashoka Abeysinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
He was responding to opposition side members views on the proclamation made by the President under the Essential Public Services Act published in the Gazette Extraordinary No 2048/47 dated 09.12.2017.
Deputy Minister Abeysinghe said the opposition members claim that army personnel would be employed to the Railway Department was baseless. Railway workers demands are unjust. They were given three discussions and all possible attempts were taken to resolve their issues, he said.
The Deputy Minister said the Railway employees demanded to change the recruiting procedure of Engine Driver Assistants. They demanded to recruit unqualified people, and not to hold tests to select them, the Deputy Minister said.
They had discussions with the President as well. Even after coming to agreements, they have resumed the trade union action. The Prime Minister and the Minister have submitted a joint paper to the Cabinet to resolve the salary issue. A committee was appointed in this regard, the Deputy Minister said.
He said a discussion was arranged for the trade unions to focus on their issues with the Finance Ministry Secretary.
We had to proclaim public transport an essential service because trade unions resorted to strike amidst all these attempts to resolve their issues, the Deputy Minister said.
He said the measure had to be taken for the sake of 2,000 employees. He said the government was aware that the measure would affect other 18,000 employees as well.
But we have no other option to resolve the issue, the Deputy Minister said.
Instructions were issued not to send the letters informing the employees that they have left their employments. But we will have to do so if they do not report to work, the Deputy Minister said.
The employees get paid overtime for nearly 600 hours, so what they are doing now is unjust, the Deputy Minister said.
Some parties attempt to gain political mileage through protests
Some parties attempt to score during election period by organising protests, while others are working hard, UNP Parliamentarian Ajith Mannapperuma said in Parliament yesterday.
He said the public should understand for whom to vote at the elections. He was responding to opposition side members views on the proclamation made by the President under the Essential Public Services Act published in the Gazette Extraordinary No 2048/47 dated 09.12.2017.
MP Mannapperuma said members of the parties that shot children on the head when they attempted to study with the light of kerosene oil bottle lamp were speaking about protests.
The Maithri-Ranil government is ready to listen to all, MP Mannapperuma said.
But those days it was not so. The public servants were tied to trees. The teachers were made to kneel down. When people asked for compensation for fuel, Antony was killed.
People were killed when they asked for water at Rathupaswala. During the previous regime, trade union activists were abducted in white vans and killed.
He said the ordinary people elected this government and they should be provided with facilities. The people should not misuse the freedom that they were given by the government, he said.
Attempts against railway unions unacceptable: JO
The Joint Opposition (JO) members said they would object to the governments attempt to suppress the Railway trade unions by a proclamation under the Essential Public Services Act.
They made these observations in relation to the proclamation made by the President under the Essential Public Services Act published in the Gazette Extraordinary No 2048/47 dated 09.12.2017, which was taken up yesterday in Parliament.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena said the government was attempting to create more issues instead of resolving the existing ones. We urge the government to withdraw the proclamation, he said. MP Ranjith de Soyza said the trade unions had initiated strike action since the government failed to resolve their (trade unions) issue. The Country was ranked among the top most four countries where corruption is rampant, he said.
MP Wimal Weerawansa said the Railway employees had made a fair request but it was not addressed. Supplementary estimates were submitted to pay for ministers vehicles, houses and offices, but the public servants issues were not addressed, he said.
Speaker adjourns Constitutional Assembly
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya adjourned the Constitutional Assembly held in Parliament since the members who were nominated to speak were not present.
The debate on the Interim Report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly was fixed to hold from 11.30 am to 6.30 pm yesterday but lasted only for few minutes as none of the members in the House were there when the Speaker called out their names to join the debate.
The Speaker called out names of members of Joint Opposition and the government.
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Parliamentarian Bimal Rathnayake speaking to the media following the adjournment said the sittings was taken up today after the budget debate, mainly on the request of the Joint Opposition.
Normally, the sittings are not taken after the budget is passed. But the JO said they needed all their 22 members to join the debate. So the sittings was taken up at the cost of the public funds. But none of them were not present. The government members were also scheduled to join the debate, but they too did not attend, Rathnayake said.
MP Rathnayake noted that these members attempt to indicate that they really stand against these moves, but they are just pretending.
Making railway essential service is unwarranted: JVP
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) objects the gazette notification of the government that proclaims the public transport and railway an essential services, JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Rathnayake said in Parliament yesterday.
He was expressing views on the proclamation made by the President under the Essential Public Services Act published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2048/47 dated 09.12.2017 was taken up. He said that when a protest halts an essential service, public are affected. Mostly, staff of essential services stage protests at faults of their managements.
Since these managements do not heed employees issues, they initiate trade union actions. Six trade unions have joined the railway strike, MP Rathnayake said.
Instead of resolving the problem through discussions, the government attempt to suppress the trade unions. We object to this move, JVP MP Rathanayake said.
Proposal under Essential Public Services Act, Appropriation (A) Bill 2016 Second Reading passed
The proposal under the Essential Public Services Act was passed in Parliament yesterday.
The Opposition requested a vote for the proposal.
Accordingly, the Speaker commenced the vote and 52 voted in favour while eight voted against.
The Appropriation (Amendment) Bill 2016 second reading was passed with a majority vote with 53 voting in favour and eight against.

Passion out in the field
Those mini teams that alternated between batting out in the field used to be common sight. But now that scene is slowly shifting into oblivion thanks to the palm-held devices and a busier generation. And like everything else, Cricket is also losing its grip in a country where it meant everything to its nation.
But the scribes have not given up their passions on Cricket. Shehan Karunatilleke penned a voluminous novel based on a Cricket legend and bagged quite a few awards. The fresh addition to the field is Ranjan Mellawa who is a Business Consultant currently based in Thailand.
A passionate  or even obsessively, you can safely assert - follower of cricket, Ranjan has been witness to almost all the key moments of the Sri Lankan edition of the game. Next to Australias eight, Sri Lanka had featured in six cricket World Cup finals so far, in ODIs and 20/20 competitions. Ranjan was the lucky audience to all six finals. This, any Cricket fan would covet in a lifetime. Plus, he has held the secretary position of a Sri Lankan cricket club of note.
What matters most, however, is that he had patience to sit down and write down all his memories something his Cricket contemporaries hardly have time for. A major portion of the Cricket books available in the market are either autobiographies or coaching manuals authored by the celebrities of the game.
To come across a book on cricket authored by a fan could be a rare experience. Even rarest is when that book is laid down in a unique, incomparable, narrative style. Titled as Winds Behind The Willows, Mellawa introduces a new clan to the cricket literature. This memoir of Mellawas life in admiration for cricket emerges as a remarkable narration of five Cricket decades full of events.
I have captured all the great moments of the Sri Lankan cricketing experience, across eleven countries and uniquely through six World Cup finals. That includes both thrills and spills. Most of these experiences you wont find in the public domain, Mellawa notes.
The book will intrigue the modern readership as it contains descriptive passages about Sri Lankas pre-Test days as well, followed by a chain of events related to the Cricket administration.
Ranjan Mellawa also operated an immigration and business consultancy for seven years when he relocated to the UK in 2005.
As a result of having had a ringside view of major happenings involving the game in general and Sri Lankan cricket in particular, both within the boundaries and through the rough and tumble without, I can now share my rich life-lessons that I have learned and the skills I have acquired, emphasising that cricket is a greater story than told by any scorecard.
Adds he: I am fondly reminiscing half-a-century of a life in love with cricket. It took me nearly 10k hours to duly convert thoughts to words, and self-publish the book.
Printed in the UK, the book was fortunate to gather glowing comments from a number Cricket legends.
An excerpt from Winds Behind The Willows
It didnt take long to convert our two-acre garden with rows of coconut trees to a mini cricket venue, popularly known as the coconut grove. Along with the neighbourhood kids, who numbered around fifteen, it hosted lots of matches spiced with many controversies, arguments, chucking, minor injuries, broken windows and lost balls.
We did sweat out in our coconut grove in the garden, on Saturdays and weekday evenings. I used to take a mighty swing at the spinning tennis ball, pitched on the off side. This, because the house was located on the leg side, and playing the ball on that side carried with it a certain danger. If it hit a glass-paned window, we would have had hell to pay from the seniors. It so happened that my brother Laksri once broke a window with a classic stroke on the leg side. As fate would have it, I was hauled up as the supposed culprit, made to kneel for around two hours and got a hiding while doing so. When my father demanded I produce the offending object, Laksri insisted, on the sly, that I hand over an old rubber ball in place of the more fancied tennis ball. The matter ended with the ball being cut to pieces.
Playing on the leg side has never been my strength ever since.
In one such instance, the ball took flight on the off side, as usual, but landed chock on a bunch of coconuts and I ran between wickets for dear life. As a squirrel on the bunch had a narrow miss and raised the alarm, a cacophony of squeaks and shrill whistles from his family created quite a din. Confusion overtook the fielders by the yo-yo bounce of a tennis ball that had just hit some coconuts. Young voices added to the din, shouting instructions to the fielder, who finally subdued the ball.
A profusion of sweat forming on all of our teen frames was the norm, as the game progressed. We relished the thirstily looked forward to water breaks at the end of an innings.

PC election could be held after March - AG
The Attorney General yesterday informed the Supreme Court that Provincial Council elections could be held after March next year following the completion of the delimitation process.
Additional Solicitor General Indika Demuni de Silva appearing on behalf of the Attorney General made these remarks pursuant to Fundamental Rights petitions filed by former Minister G.L. Peiris and six others challenging the enactment procedure of Provincial Council Election Bill which were taken up for support.
The Attorney General raised preliminary objections seeking the Supreme Courts jurisdiction to dismiss (in limine) the Fundamental Rights petitions filed by seven petitioners who challenged the enactment procedure of the Provincial Council Election Bill.
The Attorney General further informed the Supreme Court that the Court does not have a jurisdiction to hear this petition in terms of Article 124 of the Constitution since it challenges the legislative process of the country. ASG Silva stated that by these applications the petitioners are questioning the validity of the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Act, No. 17 of 2017 which has been duly passed by the Parliament exercising the legislative power of the people.
Seven petitioners filed Fundamental Rights petitions in the Supreme Court challenging the legality of amendments purported to be made to the Provincial Council Election Bill at the committee stage of the Parliament on September 20 this year.
The petitions were fixed for further inquiry on December 14.

Prof. Manique Gunesekera Memorial Oration on Thursday

The annual Professor Manique Gunesekera Memorial Oration, organised by the Department of English Language Teaching of the University of Kelaniya will be held on Thursday, December 14 from 3.00 p.m at the auditorium of the University's Manique Gunesekera Memorial Building (K5). This year's lecture is delivered by Prof. Dushyanthi Mendis from the University of Colombo.
This oration is an intellectual tribute to the life and contributions of the late Prof.Manique Gunesekera, one of the most eminent and internationally renowned academics in English Studies in Sri Lanka. When she passed away two years ago, most people who knew and loved her were emotionally unprepared to grapple with the loss of this truly unique and vivacious human being, who had been a great source of inspiration to them.
A past pupil and a former Head Girl of Holy Family Convent, Colombo 4, Prof. Gunesekera started her academic career in 1979 as an Assistant Lecturer at the English Department of the Kelaniya University where she subsequently became Head and Chair Professor.
A former Fulbright Scholar, she completed her PhD in Linguistics at the the University of Michigan, Ann-Arbor, USA. Professor Gunesekera's most significant academic contributions include her widely-acclaimed book, "The Post-Colonial Identity of Sri Lankan English" and her valiant activism to promote the use and recognition of Standard Sri Lankan English. As a former President of the Sri Lanka English Language Teachers' Association and a member of the Presidential Task Force on Teaching English, Prof. Gunesekera campaigned to uplift the quality of English language education in Sri Lanka and to re-introduce English at Grade 1 in state schools. Prof. Gunasekera played an instrumental role in changing the linguistic and educational landscapes of Sri Lanka through her mission to make English available to all, which will never be forgotten by those who were inspired by her.
She uplifted the image of the ELTU as a national centre of excellence in English language education. During her tenure, the ELTU moved to its current premises, a state-of-the art language centre with many learning facilities. In the 1990s, the Sri Lankan universities only recruited instructors to the ELTUs and they were not given parity of status and privileges enjoyed by the university lecturers. Prof. Gunesekera's decision to recruit lecturers, rather than instructors, for the ELTU from 1999 onwards, was a far-thinking decision, predating similar UGC decisions by at least a decade. With this decision, she laid the foundations at the ELTU for a highly qualified staff. This year, we are commemorating Professor Gunesekera as a fully-fledged academic department, the outcome of an initiative taken by her more than a decade ago.
This year's oration, titled "Assessing Quality in Higher Education", is delivered by Prof. Dushyanthi Mendis, a renowned linguist attached to the Department of English of the University of Colombo.
She will make a case for a dialogue about enhancing quality and highlighting weaknesses in the system and areas that need improvement, in striving for excellence. A linguist by training, Prof. Mendis has a PhD in Linguistics from the University of Michigan, and her research interests include Discourse Analysis, Corpus Linguistics, Sociolinguistics and Sri Lankan English. She is a Co-principal Investigator for the Sri Lanka Component of the International Corpus of English at the University of Giessen, Germany. Students, colleagues, friends, family members and admirers of Professor Gunesekera are invited to join the oration.

Raising her children as gender-neutral
Pink is determined to raise her two children as gender-neutral. The 38-year-old shares daughter Willow, six, and 11-month-old son Jameson, with husband Carey Hart, and has now explained that she does not want traditional gender roles imposed on her children.
"We are a very label-less household," she told U.K. newspaper The Sunday People. "Last week Willow told me she is going to marry an African woman. I was like: 'Great, can you teach me how to make African food'
"And she's like: 'Sure mama, and we are going to live with you while our house is getting ready.' I was like, 'What the f**k, who are you Who is paying for this by the way'"
The What About Us hitmaker, real name Alecia Moore, said she was glad that schools are beginning to discuss and understand children who are gender fluid.
"I was in a school and the bathroom outside the kindergarten said: 'Gender Neutral - anybody', and it was a drawing of many different shapes. I took a picture of it and I wrote: 'Progress'. I thought that was awesome. I love that kids are having this conversation," she added.
The Grammy Award winner also shared how she doesn't see herself as a woman now, but as a mother.
"I'm much more mum than I am anything else. Absolutely 100 per cent. They (Willow and Jameson) are my everything. It's the two best decisions I ever made. Every decision I make is a choice because it affects my family," she smiled.
"I do bake sales and lemonade stands. I take my kid to school and try to get there on time. I'm a f**king grown up now, it's so weird. I'm still a 12-year-old boy."

Right To Information Act awareness vital - RTI DG
The Kilinochchi and Matale districts are the only two districts in the island where no appeals on the Right to Information (RTI) requests have been made, said Director General of the Right to Information (RTI) Commission, Piyatissa Ranasinghe yesterday.
Inquiries from the Commission showed that this was due to all requests for information in the Kilinochchi district being answered by government officials within the stipulated 14 days whilst in Matale, it was the case of not many requests being made to government officers.
Both the people as well as the public servants in Kilinochchi have suffered greatly as a result of the war, thus the government officers who also have an interest in resolving the many issues, are providing answers to whatever request they get. In Matale, we have a problem with the people not being made aware of the RTI Act and thus we need more awareness programmes there, said Ranasinghe.
Ranasinghe who made the above presentations at a workshop held for Government Information Officers in the Western Province at Temple Trees, explained the process appeals took when directed to the Commission and the current progress of the Act in the country. The Western Province he said had the most number of appeals; the highest population and the greatest problems.
We received the first appeal in March 2016, having had the Act passed in February. The Commission acts on two principles; first is that all information relating to the public has to be disclosed and the second is that not releasing such information is a violation of fundamental rights, explained Ranasinghe to the Information Officers.
He added that it was not the responsibility of the general public to prove whether any information is public or not and thus it fell on the government authority to justify why information cannot be released.
A survey conducted by the Commission prior to the implementation of the Act, showed that 78 percent of government offices were open to releasing information. In the first six months after the RTI act alone, there were 12,000 requests made for information by the general public, with 302 appeals sent to the Commission. In comparison, India only had 52 requests in the first six months of implementation.
According to Commission statistics, most appeals on information requests came from within the government, of the appeals, 37.3 percent were related to human resource issues such as problems in exams, promotions and retirement from government servants. The second most frequent appeals, at 17.7 percent was with regard to land and property disputes, followed by 5.6 percent wanting information on development projects. In addition 3.3 percent of appeals were regarding school administration, Almost 90 percent of them revolved around school admissions, said Ranasinghe.
The Commission which is also mandated to provide advice to government authorities has had the most frequent requests coming from local government bodies, divisional secretariats and public enterprises.
Some officials ask us whether they can release certain information. As the Commission, we cannot advice anyone not to release information. The Officer needs to make an independent decision whether to release information or not, at his/her discretion. The public can appeal, said Ranasinghe.

Rs. 4,727 million spent on cancer treatment - Rajitha
A total of Rs. 4,727 million had been spent on the treatment offered to cancer patients since the limit of the expenses for one cancer patient lifted, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, in the past the maximum limit for the expenses for one cancer patient was Rs. 1.5 million. After this government came into power, the limit was lifted. Now cancer patients treatment does not have a limit. He expressed these views during a meeting held at the Health Ministry recently.
Minister Senaratne said that the government had spent 180 to 200 million rupees for some cancer patients. During the past three years the government offered free treatment for 1,285 cancer patients. Money had been saved by eradicating corruption in connection with drug tenders.
One cancer drug imported to Sri Lanka for Rs. 285,000 in the past is now being imported for Rs. 165,000. Another (second) cancer drug is purchased from Russia for Rs. 141,000. Cancer drugs are very expensive but now cancer patients receive them free of charge without a limit, he added.

Saudi Arabia ends 35-year ban on movie theaters

Saudis will soon be able to go to the movies for the first time in more than 35 years. From early next year, commercial movie theaters will be granted licenses, Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Culture and Information said in a statement on Monday.
It expects the first cinemas to open their doors in March. "This marks a watershed moment in the development of the cultural economy in the Kingdom," Minister of Culture and Information Awwad Alawwad said in the statement.
Saudi Arabia is undergoing an economic overhaul under Vision 2030 -- a blueprint for what the economy could look like over the next decade to reduce its reliance on oil. The government hopes that opening movie theaters will act as a catalyst for economic growth and diversification, creating new employment opportunities and providing Saudis with a greater range of entertainment options. There are currently very few entertainment attractions in the conservative society.
Many Saudis visit neighboring countries for vacations and leisure time. The Saudi government wants more of them to spend their money at home.
And there are signs that some restrictions are already being relaxed under the country's crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, who has vowed to destroy "extremist ideologies" and return to "a more moderate Islam." Women are being given the right to drive, and from next year will be allowed to enter the country's biggest sporting venues. Men and women have already been mixing at major conferences, and the kingdom also hosted music concerts this year.
The Ministry of Culture said it plans to have 300 cinemas with more than 2000 screens by 2030. It was not immediately clear which movie genres will be shown, and whether men and women will be allowed to sit together. Saudi Arabia is likely to turn to regional cinema operators as movies need to be subtitled in Arabic and censored to remove scenes of nudity and of a sexual nature. Novo Cinemas, based in the United Arab Emirates, is already considering the opportunity.
"We are absolutely studying our options to enter the Saudi market... it's an important market," CEO Debbie Kristiansen told CNNMoney. Another UAE-based operator, VOX Cinemas, said in a statement it was looking forward to "working with the government to introduce VOX Cinemas' world class offering to Saudi Arabia in the months and years ahead."
Vue International, which operates in Europe and Taiwan, described the chance to open theaters in Saudi Arabia as a "significant opportunity." 
Under Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia plans to pump billion of dollars into entertainment projects and rev up its tourism sector. The government hopes that opening cinemas will contribute more than 90 billion riyals ($24 billion) to the economy and create tens of thousands of jobs.
Saudi Arabia has already announced plans tobuild resorts on about 100 miles of the Red Sea's sandy coastline, and wants to open a Six Flags (SIX) theme park by 2022.

Save our elephants
Just a couple of weeks after the shocking discovery of Galgamuwas majestic tusker Dala Poottuwas brutal killing, comes the equally distressing news that another tusker had been killed in a similar fashion in the Puttalam area. What is even more disturbing is the fact that the tusker has been shot dead in a declared forest reserve.
We have heard the refrain that only elephants should wear ivory but Mans greed for exotic animal products knows no bounds. Fuelled by an increased demand for ivory and other elephant products from certain countries, poachers in Asia and Africa have stepped up the hunt for tuskers, often employing very brutal methods to hack off the tusks.
Our elephants and tuskers are in a very vulnerable position and have been listed as endangered by several wildlife organisations. As the forest cover dwindles and human habitats encroach on the territory of wildlife, elephants (Elephas maximus maximus) begin come to villages in search of food and water, which is the cause of the much talked about human-elephant conflict. The spread of human settlements, plantations, industry, mining and linear infrastructure facilities are squeezing elephant populations into ever decreasing pockets of forests surrounded by human settlements.
The Sri Lankan elephant population has fallen almost 65% since the turn of the 19th Century and is now estimated to be less than 5,000 in the wild. There are only around 150 tuskers left in the wild while around 250-300 elephants and tuskers live in captivity with religious institutions, state institutions and individual owners.
Around 100 elephants are killed every year by farmers and villagers in Sri Lanka and we also read about villagers being attacked and killed by marauding wild elephants. These elephants also destroy their dwellings and crops. There are no easy solutions to this issue and in fact, Sri Lanka is not the only country in the region to face this problem.
In India, for example, it is even more severe due to population (human: one billion and elephant: 27,000) and geographic reasons. Recently there was a heartbreaking picture in the Indian media of a baby elephant which had caught fire from a firecracker explosion, running away from a mob of people with its mother. Experts have tried everything from electric fences to elephant corridors, but it is extremely difficult to prevent human-elephant clashes given that the elephant is a resourceful animal that finds ways to circumvent obstacles such as fences.
Killing an elephant carries the death penalty in most of the 13 Asian countries having elephant population including Sri Lanka, but this is rarely enforced. However, following the merciless slaying of Dala Poottuwa for his tusks, there are growing calls for enforcing capital punishment for poachers who kill elephants and tuskers. On their part, the authorities have acted swiftly to nab the remains of the tusks as well as some jewellery items made from the tusks. Several suspects are in custody over the incident. The maximum possible punishment should be meted out to the culprits behind this abominable act.
Sri Lanka, as a signatory to CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna), is bound to protect its endangered species and prevent their trade in any form, alive or dead. This is important as the country is often identified as a biodiversity hotspot with many unique endemic species. Trade in ivory has been banned under CITES for nearly 20 years. Sri Lanka has made several high-profile detections of ivory bound for third countries and destroyed several such stocks at public events.
Elephants (both Asian and the African Loxodonta africana), along with whales and pangolins are on the CITES priority list for 2018, with a call for more concerted action to prevent poaching. According to CITES, determined action by Governments has brought down tusker poaching last year, with a record haul of illegally traded ivory detected in 2016.
Sri Lanka too must play a more proactive role in CITES programmes to designed to help the elephants to thrive  MIKE (Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants) and ETIS (Elephant Trade Information System). It is no secret that elephant poachers have links to transnational organised crime gangs that specialize in wildlife trade  intelligence sharing among countries with significant elephant populations is essential to keep them at bay and possibly put them in jail.
Asia has only around 49,000 elephants left in the wild with a further 15,000 captive ones in sharp contrast to Africa which has more than 500,000. But this number could drastically go down if no action is taken to prevent poaching trophy hunting and habitat loss. Sri Lanka has already drafted a National Elephant Conservation Plan that includes aspects such as research and development, education and training, fund raising and prevention of hunting/poaching. CITES also calls for engagement with local communities to gain their participation in biodiversity conservation and land use planning and provide sustainable and alternative livelihoods through financial support. These are significant steps as elephants are a part of our culture, nay, our very soul that deserve to live on without fear and danger.

Shakib Al Hasan to lead B'desh in SL Tests
DHAKA, Monday: Bangladesh have named all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan as test captain in place of Mushfiqur Rahim ahead of the two-match test series against Sri Lanka in January, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said on Sunday.
Shakib previously led the team for nine tests from 2009 to 2011 and took over the Twenty20 captaincy during the South Africa tour in October, where Bangladesh capitulated in both test matches with Mushfiqur at the helm.
Batsman Tamim Iqbal remains vice-captain of the Twenty20 side but was replaced by all-rounder Mahmudullah in the test squad. Pacer Mashrafe Mortaza keeps his role as captain of the one-day international side.
We have decided to change the test captain. Shakib will be our new test skipper from the upcoming series and Mahmudullah will be the vice-captain of the side, BCB president Nazmul Hasan told reporters on Sunday.
The visitors failed to notch a single victory in South Africa, leading to head coach Chandika Hathurusinghas resignation. - Agencies

Daddys Home 2
Shockingly tolerable!
Double the Dads have been added to the Daddys Home series as its Christmas installment Daddys Home 2 hits cinemas. The movie picks off from its prequel. Since Brad and Dusty have finally learnt to get along the next step is for them to deal with their Dads. The arrival of Christmas is the family event of the year and family means bonding, relatives and more. Brad and Dusty decide to give their children a good One-family-Christmas. Enter Mel Gibson and John Lithgow and the action turns hilarious. While Brad and his Dad Don get along very well Dusty and his Dad Kurt cannot see eye to eye.
Mark Wahlberg and Mel Gibson steal the show. WWE champ John Cean makes a surprising but significant cameo and this heightens the interest towards the movie.
Those who might have watched Bad Moms Christmas might get some familiar sense of dj vu when they watch this movie. For instance in both cases the protagonists have to deal with their parents of the same sex. Put them in the same house together for the holidays and sparks start flying on their own. This could very well be considered as the male version of Bad Moms Christmas. It is the male version of the tale told by men in a male point of view. The female characters are mostly thrown into the background and half the time ignored.
Ferrell and Wahlberg make an odd kind of comic team, since they rarely seem to be acting on the same level. For instance Ferrell can hardly bring himself to be sincere, while Wahlberg can hardly be anything but. However the combination works surprisingly well in the movie. Though Gibson plays the badass in the story he still finds space to become loveable.
Like all family comedies, the message is pro-family and the jokes are to see how the family, despite its obvious differences, manages to reconcile. Themes like Dads trying to teach their adolescent children about the birds and the bees and trying to form a link with their stepchildren run in this movie too in a rather chiched manner.
The plot could have been a bit better. The ending is especially cheesy since the musical number seems to unite all. It also has an overdose of over the top physical comedy.
The plus side of the project is that it is full of fun. However there are a few awkward moments when the fun seems to stoop almost into silliness.
A loosely structured farce that satirises modern concepts of fatherhood and masculinity, Daddys Home 2 is a flighty comedy just like its predecessor.
Daddys Home 2 is screening at Majestic Cineplex at 10.15 am, 1.15 pm, 4.15 pm, 7.15 pm, and Fri/Sat at 10.15 pm, Empire Cineplex at 1.15 pm, 4.15 pm, 7.15 pm and Fri/Sat at 10.15 pm and Sat/Sun at 10.15 am.

Spacey removed from  All the Money  in the World
All the Money in the World will begin screening at Majestic Cineplex, Empire Arcade, Regal - Gampaha, Liberty Lite and other film halls islandwide from December 22. It is a CEL release
Kevin Spacey will be removed from Ridley Scott film, All the Money in the World, Deadline reports. The film is already finished, and in a rare move the scenes in which Kevin Spacey appears as J. Paul Getty will be replaced with newly shot footage featuring Christopher Plummer.
The decision follows multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against Spacey, including accusations by Anthony Rapp, Tony Montana, Roberto Cavazos and Richard Dreyfuss son Harry Dreyfuss. Last week, Netflix announced it was severing ties with Spacey, who stars in its popular series, House of Cards.
All the Money in the World is slated for a December 22 release and the reshoots are expected to take place in the next couple weeks to meet the original release date. The film stars Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Williams, and according to Deadline, the cast, crew and Sony Pictures are in agreement to reshoot Spaceys scenes.
The controversy surrounding Spacey had already affected the film prior to the decision to reshoot his scenes. AFI Fest recently made the decision to pull the film from its closing night lineup as a result of the news revolving around Spacey.
Based on the book of the same name written by John Pearson and adapted by David Scarpa, All the Money in the World focuses on the 1973 kidnapping of J. Paul Getty III. The teenage grandson of oil billionaire J. Paul Getty was held for $17 million ransom, which his grandfather refused to pay. Rolling Stone

Spirit of workplace strategy
In the backdrop of Triple Bottom line (People-Planet-Profit), organisations are traversing towards a spirituality culture. Workplace spirituality is interpreted as employees having an inner life that sustains and is sustained by meaningful work in the context of society. While spirituality is an evolving buzz-word, there is still little research done on workplace spirituality and its holding-power in post-modern organisations and business enterprises. Organisational behaviour in the 21st Century has carved a new dimension of employee emotions that are expressed in different, but meaningful ways.
Spirituality is an empathy-driven approach being adopted by employees for several purposeful reasons. The stressful paces of life can be reasonably counterbalanced by spirituality, employees move to question the meaning of work against the backdrop of progressive job demands and studies envisage that material acquisitions (money, reputation and prestige) leave employees unfulfilled. Therefore there is a rationale for the growing interest towards workplace spirituality.
Culture aspects
Values, ethics, motivation, sustainability and leadership of individuals in organisations encompass spiritual leadership. Despite preliminary studies on workplace spirituality in Sri Lanka, there are cultural characteristics inherent to spiritual organisations. Benevolence, trust and respect, open-mindedness and strong sense of purpose are the identified organisational culture aspects. Work ethics is the holistic study of business situations, activities and decisions where the issues of right and wrong are addressed.
Spirituality is the social role of businesses intertwining the interests of both society and stakeholders. Benevolence is the expression of kindness towards employees and all stakeholders including wider society having interest in the organisation. Carroll & Buchholtz emphasised that corporate social responsibility (CSR) means the economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic expectations and desires placed upon businesses by the society at a given point in time. There is a reasonable certainty that CSR is inter-related to workplace spirituality and they are positively correlated.
Trust and respect are twin-elements which differentiate spiritual organisations. Mutual trust, honesty and integrity of employees are underpinned by dignity, esteem and value for employees by the organisation. Flexible thinking and creative-space for employees is valued by workplace spirituality known as open-mindedness.
Employees and customers
Strong sense of purpose reveals that profit is not the primary value for evolving business organisations. People and planet, the two other aspects of the triple bottom line is of equal concern and catalyses the business performance in a balanced manner. Hence, most organisations are moving from secular interests driven by profits; towards interests precipitated on employee feelings and sympathy towards people and environment (green-practices). The vertical garden concept is being practised by organisations which contribute towards ecological greenery and home-grown vegetation. This is a strategic move to minimize environmental pollution and long-term food crises.
McDonalds Corporation has initiated Pass on the Happiness, a spirituality drive by both employees and customers. Employees and customers are encouraged to regard how their work and spending respectively embrace a sense of purpose. While achieving a spiritual workplace, the stakeholders buy an ice-cream cone and donate another 80 S$ to Ronald McDonald House Charities (Nov 2017-McDonalds SG).
This is a true sense of calling by a multinational organisation to stakeholders and to be sensitive towards dire needs of society. As the season of giving-Christmas unfolds it is pertinent for businesses to consciously regard the ethical duties and work ethics towards societal needs both visible and emergent.
Against the backdrop of criticism, the question arises whether organisational profits and spirituality are compatible objectives. Thus business managers and investors should regard the paradigm shift of the traditional triple bottom line and its augmented emphasis on people and planet in modern business contexts. Secular institutions which are traditional-oriented focus primarily profit protecting secular interests. However, the evolving business entities and employees should reflect on people and planet which are spirituality-driven. This approach could engrave a spiritual workplace strategy as well.

The government announced that the Meeting of the Conference of Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), to be attended by 183 State Parties, will be held from May 22 - June 3, 2019 at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) in Colombo.
Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva, Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha made the announcement addressing the 69th Standing Committee of CITES meeting in Geneva, recently.
He said as a country with rich biological diversity, Sri Lanka is fully committed to the implementation of the CITES provisions to ensure sustainable trade that takes into account the conservation of wild fauna and flora essential for a healthy and prosperous economy.
He further drew attention to the recent actions taken by Sri Lanka in fulfilling its commitment under the Convention, including the seizure of illegally traded blood ivory, which was publicly destroyed in 2016, as well as the initiatives taken to list thresher shark species under CITES Appendix II as a protected species.
The offer to host the Conference was made as Sri Lanka is mindful of the challenges that remain to be overcome at national and international levels, the Ambassador added.
With more than 3,000 delegates expected to attend the event in Sri Lanka in 2019, it is expected to open up opportunities for the locals in the areas of biodiversity conservation, tourism promotion, and cultural diplomacy, and also promote Sri Lanka as a preferred venue for international conferences.
The event and lead up to it, is also considered as an opportunity to raise awareness among Sri Lankans on trade in wild fauna and flora, and the need for conservation of rich biodiversity in the country.
The offer to host the 18th Meeting of Conference of Parties to the CITES to be held in Sri Lanka was initially made by Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, which was endorsed by the 17th Conference of Parties to the CITES held in South Africa in 2016. CITES is an international agreement between governments which aims to ensure that trade of wild fauna and flora does not threaten their survival. The Sri Lankan delegation to the 69th Standing Committee meeting headed by Ambassador Aryasinha also included M.G.C Sooriyabandara, Director General of the Department of Wildlife Conservation and National CITES Focal Point, Mafusa Lafir, First Secretary, Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka in Geneva and Daniel Fernando, Advisor to the Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife, and Buddha Sasana.

Sri Lanka breeds arowana successfully in Polonnaruwa
For the first time in Sri Lanka, successful captive breeding of Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) has been recorded in the Polonnaruwa district recently.
The species is considered as a high valued ornamental fish in the international market and the local market as well. This fish is generally called as 'lucky fish' in Sri Lanka and famous as Dragon Fish in Chinese culture as it resemblance the Chinese Dragon, an auspicious symbol. At present, arowana is among the top imported live fish species in to Sri Lanka to fulfill the growing local demand from aquarium hobbyists.
The value of an arowana in the local market varies from Rs. 5000 to Rs. 500,000 based on the size, colour and the other body features. Therefore, the commercial expansion of arowana production will be a turning point for the ornamental fish industry in Sri Lanka while it will substitute imports.
International trade of arowana is controlled under the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora Fauna (CITES). However, CITES allows Asian arowana to be traded when they are bred in captivity with proven records.
Breeding of arowana is not an easy task, it requires a lot of ground facilities like larger size earthen ponds, good broodstock and a breeder with good skill of breeding. It takes approximately 3-4 years to prepare a broodstock for breeding.
D.M. Wimalsiri, the owner of Oasis Fish Farm at Polnnaruwa and Managing Director of Shine Aqua International Trading Pvt Ltd, has fulfilled all above requirements patiently and is the one who achieved this difficult task of breeding of arowana for the first time in Sri Lanka with his long-term efforts and professional fish breeding skills.
EDB has identified Wimalasiri as a professional fish breeder and a good entrepreneur during 2008-2012 when the EDB implemented a project in the Polonnaruwa district to increase the export supply base and the quality of arowana.
At that time, he was President of the Ornamental Fish Growers Association established by the EDB in the Polonnaruwa district. Having identified the potential for ornamental fish farming for export in the Polonnaruwa district, EDB, with the support of other relevant government agencies, implemented the above project in order to increase the supply base for export and to improve the quality of fish produced from Polonnaruwa. He was among one of the 225 beneficiaries under the project which had a significant impact on the lives of people in the Polonnaruwa district, where it has eventually became the supply hub for ornamental fish exports from Sri Lanka at present.
Wimalsiri is the top supplier of fish for export from Polonnaruwa at present, having a number of ponds in an area of 28 acres of land. He has the biggest outgrower network in the industry of more than 525 small-scale well established suppliers connected with him, which provides a livelihood for more than 1,000 farmers in the area in addition to the 50 people directly employed by him on his three farms located in the Polonnaruwa district.
He has been further assisted by the EDB with a grant of Rs 1.5 Mn to set up a quarantine facility under the fish quality improvement project implemented by the EDB during 2012-2015. With this support given by the government and with his own effort, he is now ready to explore the international market.

Sri Lanka eliminated malaria  Rajitha
In 2008, the last case of indigenous malaria-related death was reported in Sri Lanka. The National Strategic Plan was developed with the aim of achieving malaria elimination within a time-bound framework to reach zero local transmission by 2014.
Since Sri Lanka was declared malaria-free on Sept. 5, the country has now emerged as an example of what is needed to eliminate malaria and what are the opportunities and challenges of malaria-free status, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said while addressing the Ministerial Roundtable on Accelerating Elimination of Malaria in the South-East Asia Region on November 29 in New Delhi.
Minister Senaratne said that several key factors among many others such as the government commitment, dedication of health workers, highly technical and professional approach combined with the extremely effective surveillance system paved the way to reach the objectives two years ahead of the target year with the last case of locally transmitted case of malaria reported in 2012.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that the Governments partnership with locally operating NGOs was an important factor which contributed to the successful control of malaria in conflict affected areas during the civil war. By 2000, Sri Lankas eight conflict affected districts accounted for most malaria infections.
Integrated vector control and treatment interventions were scaled up in the conflict affected districts by the AMC and the regional malaria teams, often in partnership with non-governmental organizations and the military. The rebels, Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), to a great extent, supported the governments efforts to control malaria in areas under their control which was a unique gesture not seen in many large scale conflict situations.
Minister Senaratne also said that with the ending of civil war in 2009, effective coverage of interventions was extended to cover the entire island paving way to the elimination of malaria from the island. Anti-Malaria Campaign and its regional teams got themselves re-oriented for the elimination of the disease according to the WHO guidelines for malaria elimination.

Sharjah: Opener Paul Stirling struck a brilliant century and left-arm spinner George Dockrell took four wickets as Ireland thumped Afghanistan by five wickets in the third and final one-day international in Sharjah on Sunday.
Dockrell claimed four for 28 to help dismiss Afghanistan for 177 in 48.2 overs before Stirlings 97-ball 101 sealed a 2-1 series victory as Ireland reached their target with 12 overs to spare. Stirlings sixth ODI hundred included four sixes and 11 boundaries and gave Ireland the ideal preparation before next Marchs 2019 World Cup qualifiers to be held in Zimbabwe. Stirling set his team on track for a successful chase with a 62-run second-wicket stand with Andy Balbirnie (35) before falling leg-before with just eight needed for the win.
Earlier, Afghanistan won the toss and elected to bat but could not cope against Dockrell and the medium pace of Barry McCarthy, who finished with 3-32.
Only Rahmat Shah and Rashid Khan offered any real resistance as both made 44, while Javed Ahmadi scored 27 at the top of the order. Afghanistan won the first match by 138 runs, but Ireland had levelled the series with a 51-run victory in the second ODI. AFP

Sued over  Gone Girl
Actress Reese Witherspoon has been sued by a writer who claims Gone Girl is a rip-off of a screenplay penned by her. Witherspoon received various awards for producing the 2014 film Gone Girl. A screenplay writer named Leslie Weller has claimed she wrote a screenplay called Out of the Blue back in 2005 and sent a copy of the same to a script consultant. That allowed someone to lift her work.
Reportedly, she said the book Gone Girl, which came out in 2012, is a rip off of her screenplay. Mentioning similarities between the book and her screenplay, Weller said they both focus on a married couples relationship where the husband and wife are slowly drifting apart.
They both contain a key twist where the wife is not the nice, normal, and somewhat naive housewife and is in fact a psychopath who sets up her husband, she said. Besides Witherspoon, Weller is also suing the books author Gillian Flynn and the movies director David Fincher.

UNP is the best brand for Sri Lanka - PM
Sri Lanka must seize the moment when the Indian Ocean becomes the growth region of the world, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said last evening.
I believe in branding, and we always say, the UNP is the best brand for Sri Lanka,the Prime Minister said.
He was speaking at an awards ceremony for Sri Lankan brands sponsored by the international Interbrand rating group at the Hilton Colombo.
We missed the opportunities that many of our Asian partners did in capitalizing on all those moments, the Prime Minister said.
For a country that was on par with Japan at the very beginning, we seem to have missed the bus on every occasion,the Prime Minister said.
He said that now, business leaders must compete, building strong brands locally and internationally to not only catch up, but leap-frog into the developed world.
Yes, (the Industrial Revolution) left Asia behind, the Prime Minister said. But without our wealth there would not have been an industrial revolution in Europe.
The Indian Ocean has just started its growth scenario, he said. It will go on: look at South Asia, from Pakistan all the way to Bangladesh, and beyond to Southeast Asia and Indonesia all these are countries that are growing.
And here we are situated in the middle of the Indian Ocean, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added.
Premier Wickremesinghe said that to angle itself as a global hub, the country must strengthen and add new Free Trade Agreements with countries like Japan,Singapore, and China. Pointing to the brand awards, which honoured state and private banks, telecommunications companies, and tea companies, among others, he said the recognition should only be a starting point.
I am happy the three State banks have achived first,second and third places respectively (in the awards), but that does not mean you can avoid the restructuring, the Prime Minister said.

UNP created environment for women to join politics  PM
The government has created the change of increasing women representation at grass roots level with the forthcoming local elections. The groundwork for this change was laid by the UNP, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said it was the UNP which created the environment for women to join politics.
Therefore, men and women have a responsibility of electing the maximum number of women at the forthcoming election, the Prime Minister said.
I assure you that other legal steps will be taken to encourage womens voice and bring in all relevant legal enactments to give more weight to the opinion of women, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said. The Prime Minister made this observation addressing a meeting of the Kotte Electorate UNP Central Organisation held at the Sirikotha UNP Headquarters in Pitakotte on December 8. The Prime Minister said women encountered problems in both the political and employment spheres.
In order to address them increased women representation should be ensured at the forthcoming election as an initial step towards resolving them, the Prime Minister said.
Although we obtained the right to universal suffrage in 1932, it was mostly males who indulged in politics, the Premier said.
It was the male population which was dominant in the education sector too. But this situation changed with the 1977 political revolution, Prieme Minister Wickremesinghe said. Today, women were dominant in the teaching, medical professions as well as state private and self employment sectors, the Premier said. As such, all women should join hands and support the UNP at the forthcoming election because the party would do its best to empower women both politically and economically, the Premier said.
Women are playing a major role in the countries three main income earing sectors, namely, the foreign employment, garment and tea producing sectors.Eventhough women constitute the bigger portion of the population they had not received a proper representation or status in the country, the PM said. The UNP which understood this situation raised a voice on their behalf as far back as 2010 stating that the existing system did not offerwomen their due place in society. The UNP also campaigned for minimum female representations at Pradesheeya Sabhas. The Rajapaksa regime failed to heed their request for women representations, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
Instead of heeding this request the Rajapaksa regime honoured the chairman of the Akuressa Pradeshiya Sabha who boated about seducing 100 women.
There were thousands of women in the North and South Who had lost their husbands in the war. But, past rulers did not provide any relief to them either, the Premier added. The Rajapaksa regime failed to do anything to prevent harassment against women, the Prime Minister added.
The Prime Minister said ensuring womens representation at future elections was one of the promises made during the last Presidential election by fielding Maithripala Sirisena as the Common Candidate. Today, the election system has been changed to a mixture of the Ward and Preferential Votes system.
The UNP agreed to this system on the basis of ensuring 25 percent womens representation. If women did not gain enough representation through the Ward system they could be given prominence on the Preferential list, the Prime Minister said.

West Indies in trouble after Taylor record sets monumental target
HAMILTON: A record-equalling 17th century by Ross Taylor had New Zealand closing in on a series sweep against the West Indies after day three of the second Test in Hamilton on Monday.
The West Indies, set a world-record target of 444 to win, were in trouble at 30 for two by stumps with two full days of play remaining.
It was New Zealands day as they shut down the West Indies for 221 to lead by 152 on the first innings.
New Zealand declared their second innings at 291 for eight, with Taylor 107 not out, and then took two top-order wickets by stumps. Taylor joined the late Martin Crowe and current captain Kane Williamson on 17 Test centuries.

The 33-year-old, who offered two chances in an otherwise majestic innings, reached the milestone driving Raymon Reifer to the boundary for only the 11th four in his 198 ball innings.
Williamson was earlier out for 54 as he looked to lead New Zealand to a series sweep following the innings victory in the first Test.
The current record for a victorious fourth innings chase is 418, achieved 14 years ago when the West Indies reached the target against Australia for the loss of seven wickets.
Taylor did give chances in a near majestic innings, with a top edge from Miguel Cummins flying just out of reach of wicketkeeper Shane Dowrich and on 35 he was dropped in the gully by Shai Hope off Shannon Gabriel.
Boult on hat-trick
New Zealand were 263 for eight when Taylor brought up his hundred and with tailender Tim Southee (not out 22) plundering more boundaries they added a further 28 runs before declaring.
The West Indies first innings folded quickly on the third morning with Trent Boult taking the last two wickets to fall in successive balls.
But he missed out on a hat-trick when the West Indies batted again -- needing a wicket first ball he removed Powell on his third delivery.
As New Zealand built on their lead, the West Indies continued to fight with Miguel Cummins reviving memories of a time when the calypso cricketers had seriously venemous bowlers.
He zipped the ball around the ears of the New Zealand batsmen in a short-pitched salvo mixed with full-length deliveries to have three for 69.
His scalps included Williamson for 54 when the New Zealand skipper could not get his bat down fast enough on a yorker the ripped out the middle stump.
It was Cummins first ball after lunch and followed his first ball caught and bowled dismissal of Jeet Raval for four in the morning session.
He returned to the short delivery to send off the inconsistent Henry Nicholls for five when an attempt to fend the ball away was taken by wicketkeeper Shane Dowrich.
Mitchell Santner had a life when an edge off Cummins burst through Dowrichs hands to the boundary, and he was hit on the helmet when he ducked into a ball that did not bounce as expected.
But when the short-pitched salvo ended it was spinner Roston Chase who accounted for Santner, caught at long-on for 26.
New Zealand were 190 for five at tea and declared three wickets later to have 40 minutes bowling at the West Indies before stumps. AFP

What condominium owners should know
The complex documentation of a condominium project should be clearly understood by the purchaser
First-time condo buyers are sometimes confused by the monthly maintenance fee that condo buildings charge. Combined with property taxes and your mortgage payments, they can add up to a hefty percentage of your total housing costs. But what is a condo maintenance fee and what does it cover And how does it compare to the costs of owning a house
Condo maintenance fees are your percentage share of the costs to run the building as a whole. Unlike rent, they are not a profit source for the management; in fact, each building is registered as a non-profit corporation in many countries.
Generally, these fees correspond to the individual utility bills you pay on a home, along with maintenance work such as window cleaning, housecleaning, gardening, and so on. Fees are calculated according to the size of your unit  a two-bedrooms fees are higher than a studio apartments or one bedroom. For instance  these fees are recalculated each year, up or down, according to the buildings annual operating budget.
A certain portion is also set aside as part of a contingency fee, which every condo must maintain by law. The contingency fund covers any special costs incurred as part of building upkeep, such as a new roof or repairs to heating or plumbing equipment.
The maintenance fees for townhouses within a complex are usually slightly lower. Often townhouses have their utilities separately metered, so these are not included in the fee; but townhouse owners still pay a share for maintenance of common areas, security and other general costs.
Beyond these basics, theres a wide variation in the features each individual condo building offers, and the fees vary accordingly. One building might offer beefed-up security, concierge service and underground parking; another might have a fully equipped gym or pool with trainers and classes; or you may have access to special perks like a rooftop patio or guest suite. All of these are reflected in the monthly fee, and in some cases are optional.
Five things you do not know about condo fees
Condo fees can be contentious - here's the real truth behind those monthly dues
For many homebuyers, the issue of condo fees is as contentious as they come. In one camp are those who cant see past paying money into an association that may or may not use that money effectively; in the other are those who find value in what condo life provides or are not yet ready to buy a house. Unfortunately, what both sides in the debate tend to have in common is misinformation about condominium fees and how they actually work. If you own a condo or are thinking about buying one, here are some things you might not know about the fees.
1) They are not all bad
Many homebuyers categorically refuse to consider a condo because of the fees alone. No fees are levied in a house, so condo fees are essentially a rip-off, right Must not jump to that conclusion!!!!. What many people forget about owning any kind of home is that it entails a lot of financial responsibility. Roofs leak, foundations shift, washing machines overflow and the occasional Tennis balls flies through the kitchen window while kids are playing outside. And whether you own a condo or a house of your own, you pay for all those unhappy little occurrences. The only difference is that in a condo, that financial responsibility is often shared with other owners.
In a condominium, the fees typically cover monthly expenses and utilities in the building, but theyre also designed to collect money in advance to ensure that owners are held equally accountable for their investment. If you own your own home, you wont be forced to set aside money each month just in case your home requires an expensive repair (although thats a good idea), but you will be on the hook if something goes wrong. In addition, condo fees often go toward paying for things youd have to spend out for as an owner of any property, such as insurance, and sometimes even heat, water and cable TV.
2) Lower isnt always better
No one wants high condo fees, but finding the building with the lowest fees isnt always the best bet either. Think of condo fees as a bit of a layaway plan for future improvements to the building, such as painting and necessary repairs. If theres no money set aside, that work either wont get done or owners will suffer a shake-down for additional funds in the form of a special assessment.
Before buying a condo you must have a robust discussion with your realtor who specializes in condominium sales. But unfortunately there are no realtors who have such an in depth knowledge of condos and their management systems. Purchase of a condominium is not a transaction like buying a residential home. Owning a condominium will continue to be a long process. You have to work along with your co-owners to protect your condo investment as long as you own it. If you make an offer, make sure you put in a condition to review the condominium documents. This will ensure you get the information you need about the condo and whether there is a healthy reserve within the building.
Sometimes you will have a designated parking spot for your condo. If you do not own a vehicle, you must be able to rent it to another person as that parking space is included in the condominium fee that you have to pay.
In other words, if you want to know how expensive a buildings condo fees really are, youll have to find out everything you can about what they include and how much money the building needs for upkeep.
3) You may be paying for things you dont use
Condo fees are a lot like taxes: Sometimes, you dont personally benefit from the way the money is spent. That might explain why people tend to have such a strong reaction to condo fees, but the reality is that this is just a necessary evil of any collective asset. If your building includes a pool, a gym or a patio, your fees will go toward maintaining those common areas, even if you never set foot in any of them. The flipside, of course, is that if the building requires a major repair, youll get to split that bill with all the other owners. It also means that you might derive additional value from your fees at the time you are selling your condo. These extra facilities you find in your condo will definitely add a value to your investment even if you do not use the facilities.
4) They can go up at any time
Some countries like Canada and the United States have strict laws to protect the condominium buyers and their investments.
According to the Condo Education survey, 68 percent of condo buyers had no idea that their fees could increase. Well, heres news for you: Condo fees can increase at any time, and theres virtually no limit as to how high they can go. Thats because its up to the condominiums board of directors to ensure that enough money is being collected to pay for current expenses and save up for future repairs. If something unexpected happens to the building, or other common costs such as gas or electricity shoot up, condo fees might go up right along with them. Unfortunately, 38 percent of condo buyers also said that they werent confident that they could afford a fee increase.
If youre buying a condo or any other property, you should never be at the very limit of what you can afford. It is way too risky, and not just because of condo fees; interest rates, utilities and taxes can also increase significantly.
Qualifying for a mortgage isnt the same as feeling like you can actually afford home ownership. When qualifying for a mortgage, look at your numbers in terms of all the possible fees. You should build in an inflation rate on the condo fees to see what your budget would look like if those fees were to increase. You also want to discuss interest rates with your lender, and what would happen if those were to increase down the road.
5) Condo fees are included in your mortgage calculation
The condo fee can be a significant portion of your mortgage. You have no control over the increases of the condominium fees. Some people may wonder it may be worth for them to buy a single family home where you have full control over what repairs and improvements are made to the property when its exclusively your own.
The bottom line: You can still pay out of pocket
Just because youre sharing a wall with a set of neighbors doesnt mean youre a renter. Owning a condo is just like owning any other home - youre responsible for maintaining it. The major difference is that paying for repairs might be a lot more complicated. For some people, the benefits of living in a condo far outweigh these inconveniences. Just be sure that you choose your condo carefully and assess what its fees really amount to. As with all things financial, condo fees arent just about what you pay, theyre also about what you get in return.

Women make up 90% of local craftspeople
For the first time, chic, urban craft trends enigmatically nurtured by an unusual group of Lankan seniors have entered the domestic marketplace. We congratulate your innovative approach and wish you success in our crafts market, said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen speaking at the launch event of Shilpa Saviya crafts entrepreneur exhibition by National Crafts Council at Jaguar Land Rover showroom.
The national exhibition, along with traditional crafts, featured emerging urban crafts for the first time. Some of the urban crafts were nurtured by senior Lankan traditional craftsmen who seemed pleased to pass down their intangible knowhow downstream.
This event is yet another important step by the government to strengthen the capacity of Sri Lankas crafts tradition and our craftsmen-it also focuses on developing entrepreneurial skills of our craftsmen and linking them to international buyers.
There are 25,000 Sri Lankan craftsmen registered with the National Crafts Council and 90% of them are women.
The Craft Council is making many efforts to develop our designs and product quality with training and taking the craftsmen to such important global destinations as Thailand Australia and Malaysia. We have finalized all work on the twenty five new District Craft Councils to be established for the first time in Sri Lanka to help regional craftsmen and provide them a voice that has been not available to them in all these years. Therefore any support for this sector is empowering our rural women and supporting them.
The Colombo Design Market is an upcoming platform for artisans and designers in Sri Lanka said Ms Alifiya Mutaher, Founder of Colombo Design Market.

Paul Topping launched his first book The Whinging Pome recently at the Barefoot Garden Cafe. The term pome stands for Prisoner of Mother England, a term used for a British national who often complains (or whinges) about the state of affairs in other countries. A variation of this term, whinging pom, was used liberally on British nationals who moved to Australia following World War II and complained continuously of the conditions there. Topping explained that the title of his book derived from the term which has been used by his wife to address him.
The book covers the many experiences Paul has had during his travels, listing 18 of his favourite countries in the book. Here are a few moments from the launch.

That Shah Rukh Khan and Farah Khan are BFFs in Bollywood isnt any news. Farah has directed films like Main Hoon Na, Om Shanti Om and Happy New Year, all of which have had SRK play the lead. The duo not only shares a great professional relationship but also a great camaraderie off the sets. They are often seen visiting each other and being part of each others parties and get-togethers.
However, rumour has it that SRK will not be a part of Farahs next venture. Reports suggest that Shah Rukh doesnt have the time and is also allegedly not too happy with the quality of the film dished out to him. So, now Farah reportedly plans to cast a younger actor in her next film and make changes depending on whom she is casting. TNN
