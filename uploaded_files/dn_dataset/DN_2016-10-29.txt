Rangana Herath makes debut as Test captain : Zimbabwe plays landmark 100th Test against Sri Lanka
HARARE: Zimbabwe will play its landmark 100th Test when it takes on Sri Lanka in the first of the two-match series in Harare starting Saturday (October 29). It will be a special Test for Sri Lanka too, for the team has a new, albeit temporary, captain in Rangana Herath at the age of 38.
The home teams recent results have not been favourable  Zimbabwe comes into the series having lost both Tests against New Zealand in its previous series by big margins  and it will hope that the milestone Test will usher the team into a new era.
Zimbabwe cricket is in a state of transition, with senior players gradually making way for youngsters. Vusi Sibanda, Elton Chigumbura and Chamu Chibhabha find no place in the squad, while Hamilton Masakadza is in search of runs.
Zimbabwes batting unit, though, still have some valuable experience in the form of Craig Ervine and Sean Williams in the middle order. Ervine will come into the game with a lot of confidence, having made a fighting 146 against New Zealand in his last Test. Masakadza might not be in the best of form, but he does add strength in a young batting line-up.
The Test series against Sri Lanka is also a great opportunity for some promising names to make a mark. Peter Moor, the wicketkeeper batsman, showed what he was capable of during his 71 on Test debut against New Zealand. Malcolm Waller is in good form too, making his way back to the Test side after scoring four consecutive half-centuries in the recent series against Pakistan A.
Zimbabwe also has an uncapped batsman in Tarisai Musakanda, the 21-year-old, who has made his way to the top after impressive performances in first-class cricket.
The home sides bowling attack has been hit by injuries to Tendai Chatara and Tinashe Panyangara. Chris Mpofu and Carl Mumba, the uncapped seamer, will form the pace-bowling department.
Sri Lanka too has been hampered by injuries to Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal, forcing the selectors to name a new captain in Herath. However, Sri Lanka should be the favourite, having whitewashed Australia at home 3-0 in the teams previous Test series. The big names are missing but there is no dearth of class in Sri Lankas batting line-up, with Kusal Mendis and Dhananjaya de Silva in particular impressing against Australia. The dashing Kusal Perera also adds might to the line-up. Sri Lankas bowling attack is led by the skipper, who is fast establishing himself as one of his countrys best ever cricketers. He has younger spinning colleagues in Dilruwan Perera and Lakshan Sandakan, the chinaman, for company. The pace attack will be led by Suranga Lakmal, and also has uncapped names in the 19-year-old Lahiru Kumara alongwith Lahiru Gamage.
The first Test will be a special one for Zimbabwe, but it will have to pull collectively to make it a memorable one.

England stutter after Bangladesh collapse
DHAKA, Friday  Tamim Iqbal scored his eighth Test century before Moeen Ali took 5-57 to help England dismiss Bangladesh for 220 runs on the first day of the second Test Friday.
In a topsy-turvy days play in Dhaka, opener Tamim made a quickfire 104 off 147 balls while Mominul Haque scored 66 as the hosts surged to what should have been a commanding score of 171 for one.
But Tamims dismissal, lbw to Ali, sparked a spectacular collapse, as Bangladesh lost their last nine wickets for 49 runs with seven of their batsmen failing to make double figures.
England then suffered their own mini-collapse as they were reduced to 50 for three before rain brought an early end to proceedings, 11.3 overs before the scheduled close of play at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium.
Shakib Al Hasan removed Ben Duckett for seven before young Mehedi Hasan ended Alastair Cooks innings at 14 through lbw. Cook, who equalled Michael Athertons record of 54 Tests as England captain
at the start of play, was initially given not out but the decision was overturned after Bangladesh reviewed. Mehedi then dismissed Gary Ballance for nine, the batsmans third single figure score of the series, to bring Bangladesh right back into the game, with England still trailing them by 170 runs.
Ali was unbeaten on two at the close, leaving him centre stage at the start of day two of the Test after his starring role in the drama of the opening day. Tamim and Mominul dominated the morning session after Woakes earned England an early breakthrough removing opener Imrul Kayes for one, with Duckett taking a spectacular catch at point. Tamim smashed 12 boundaries but he became Alis first victim of the day
shortly after driving the same bowler for back-to-back fours through cover to bring up his third century in six Tests against England. It ended his 170-run stand with Mominul, who had also looked solid until he too was bowled by Ali for 66. The all-rounders Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes shared the other five wickets as the tourists tightened the noose on a Bangladeshi side still reeling from the disappointment of losing the first Test by just 22 runs.

Mennie gets surprise call-up to Australia Test squad
Australias first Test squad has been revealed, with selectors handing a surprise call-up to South Australian fast-bowler Joe Mennie. Chairman of selectors Rod Marsh named a 12-man squad on Friday, with the key decisions being the retention of Shaun Marsh at the top of the order and the selection of Mennie.
The South Australian seamer, who was the Sheffield Shields top wicket-taker last season (51 wickets at 21.21 runs apiece), is one of four quicks in the group, alongside Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Peter Siddle.
Mennies selection comes at the cost of Jackson Bird, who was a part of the squad in Sri Lanka in August. Marsh revealed that Mennies ability with the bat was a factor in his selection over Bird.
(Bird) came very close. Thing that cost him a place was his batting, Marsh said. Weve got to get runs at the bottom of the order as well
Mennie averages 18.50 in first-class cricket, with five half-centuries to his name. By comparison, Bird averages 8.97 and has a top score of 32.
Squad:
Steve Smith (capt), David Warner, Josh Hazlewood, Usman Khawaja, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Shaun Marsh, Joe Mennie, Peter Nevill, Peter Siddle, Mitchell Starc, Adam Voges
