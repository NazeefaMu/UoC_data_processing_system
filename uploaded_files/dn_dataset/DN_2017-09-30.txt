Why move to pro-Myanmar crisis and condemnation
Sri Lanka is not entirely free of international denunciations with regard to the situation that prevailed in the final stages of the war to defeat the terrorist and separatist LTTE, as well as concerns about the situation regarding missing persons in a wider period before and after the end of that war. The country has certainly made considerable progress in this regard, due to the reconciliation and peace building policies of the present government, especially in the early period of the present coalition of unity. There is much to be done to get over the allegations from abroad, but more importantly to show the affected sections of the population within this country itself that suitable and remedial action has been, and will be taken.
This is certainly not the time for Sri Lanka to be in the foreign headlines on issues relating to human rights in the negative and especially the non-humanitarian treatment of refugees, from any country or society; especially in the context of what has today become an issue of the widest international condemnation  the treatment of the Rohingyas by Myanmar. This is exactly what has happened with the attack on the Rohingya refugees occupying premises rented by the UNHCR at Mt. Lavinia earlier this week. The news of the attack was flashed on several foreign news outlets, raising issues about Sri Lankas commitment to the principles of international law relating to the treatment of refugees, and international conventions on treatment of refugees.
The Rohingya crisis is now part of the big news very day. Nearly a half-million Rohingya Muslims have fled from Myanmar to Bangladesh in the past year, most of them since Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgent attacks on security forces had reportedly prompted a military crackdown and reprisals by the majority Buddhists of Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine state in that country. What the world is seeing  through reports from many media organisations, UN refugee institutions and international human rights organisations, is the discrimination and persecution of Rohingya Muslims by a Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where the government denies them citizenship and considers them illegal immigrants. Extremist Buddhist monks are known to have led attacks on the Rohingyas, contributing much to the situation they are in today.
Colonial past
The crisis of the Rohingyas certainly goes back to the colonial period of British rule in the region. The close geographical links between Myanmar (then Burma) and the Indian sub-continent, and the demarcations drawn by the British when carving out Pakistan, do not appear to have given due consideration to the Rohingya Muslim population that was largely on the borderline between Myanmar and East Pakistan, which later became the independent Bangladesh. The Burmese, and later Myanmar, have denied them citizenship, with the related discriminations and persecutions. The Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who holds a very important position in the present Myanmar government, but not in command of its Armed Forces, appears to be giving in to the anti-Rohingya and pro-Buddhist majoritarian politics of the day.
Sri Lanka with its position of a vast Buddhist majority and a minority Muslim population, and in the context of the not so distant attacks on the Muslim population in the Alutgama  Beruwala areas led by sections of the yellow robes, is in danger of falling into a similar accusations by the international community, if the situation that took place earlier this week is allowed to continue in any way. The politics of this country can very easily be transformed into a ruthless swing or sweep against a minority, which may not be wholly supported by the majority Buddhists in the country. It is not the majority of people who are involved in such situations, but the organised manipulators of people and the crooked political strategists. This calls for the strongest action by government, especially through proper public education and timely action when necessary, to curb the rise of extremist feelings through majoritarian strategists.
The Record
To get the records straight, Rohingya refugees have come to Sri Lanka from March 2008, when a boat carrying Myanmar and Bangladeshi nationals that had left from Coxs Bazaar, Bangladesh suffered engine failure off Mullaitivu, and were rescued by the Sri Lanka Navy. All 55 persons were recognized as refugees, and later arrangements were made for them to migrate for resettlement in the USA in 2012 by the UNHCR.
In 2013, the SL Navy rescued two boatloads of persons, again from Coxs Bazaar, Bangladesh, one carrying 138 persons from Bangladesh and Myanmar, and the other carrying 32 from Myanmar. The Government agreed that the UNHCR should arrange for a phased release of these Rohingya persons, which took place in November 2015 to the USA and Canada.
The latest is 30 Myanmar nationals  Rohingyas  rescued by the SL Navy on April 30, 2017, temporarily held at the Mirihana Immigration Detention Centre, and later on a Court order in Sri Lanka, dated August 8, 2017, released to the care of the UNHCR, and housed in the premises that came under attack this week at Mt. Lavinia. The number there is now 31, because one child was born here. Sixteen of these 31 persons are children. The question that arises is what serious threat there could be to Sri Lanka from 31 Rohingya refugees, of whom at least half are children. The Rohingya issue has been developing in Myanmar over the years, as we saw the arrival of similar refugees in larger numbers earlier, and resettled abroad by the UNHCR. What is the big danger that prevailed with this group of 31, including one infant born here, to lead to all the violent protests at Mt. Lavinia Is it the genuine concern for the safety of Sri Lanka, and its Buddhist majority population and cultural values, or the politics of division and the majoritarian thrust which is seeking to strengthen its political impact What is also of important concern, especially in Sri Lanka, is the role of those in yellow robes, who lead and organize such protests and attacks. This is certainly not the role of the Maha Sangha who bring the message of tolerance and compassion that is the core of Buddhist teaching. Should this compassion, not be extended to all humans who deserve it  even the Rohingyas This is certainly the substance for an important and urgent debate in this country. The fact that Buddhists make up 70 per cent of Sri Lankas population, must show its larger commitment to genuine Buddhist values.
PC polls debate
The Governments success in ramming through the Provincial Council Amendment provisions through Parliament last week, what many see as showing little concern for the very good Supreme Court order on the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, is having its continuing reverberations in politics. There is the need for Government to make sure the delimitation proposal on PCs brought in at the last moment, will be in keeping with its assurance that the Sabaragamuwa, North Central and Eastern PC polls will be held by March next year. Any delay on delimitation of PCs, as was so common with the Local Government units, will certainly be a political disaster for the government, in its immediate dealings with the people.
The Joint Opposition is certainly having a good debating time on the PC issue, and its accusations of Government manipulating the parliamentary process, and its allegations of the governments disrespect to the Constitution. JO members critical of the government on disrespect for the Constitution, have forgotten that all of them, and many in the government too, did vote for the 18th Amendment, that moved away from Constitutional thinking, by giving unlimited terms to the Executive President. It is a mockery for members of both the JO and SLFP in government to talk of respecting the Constitution, after having voted for the 18th Amendment for a permanent Rajapaksa Regime. That is the curlicue of politics. But the issue of the timing the PC polls, will certainly be a major issue for the government, if delimitation, as many suspect, would cause poll delays.
While on a broader issue, the JVP is certainly making an important case for the passage of the National Audit Bill, which has been delayed for years, and was a major promise of the Common Candidate for the Executive Presidency in January 2015. But the JVP, in its attempts to present itself as the next choice for the people, will have to be more effective in its policies and proposals, and a better look at its past, that make it more shaky in reality, than on the language of propaganda.
As the Budget approaches the Government will certainly have to face the rising protests of the people on the cost of living. The price of essential foodstuffs is showing all sign of a sky rocket with Rice, Coconut and Gas  already at the core of the rise, which affects every household. Cartoonists are having a good time with humour on the reality of Haal, Pol and Gas'. The stuff of humour could soon be the clout of peoples protest.

A World where parental love and acceptance prevails: NCPA Chairperson
World Children's Day 2017 message:
A World where parental love and acceptance prevails is the theme for Childrens Day this year. In a day and age where children suffer violence and cruelty and degrading treatment at the hands of adults, it is vital that we spread the message of love and kindness and non-violence among all sections of society, especially the children. It is the obligation and the duty of the entire community to rid our society of all manifestations of violence. It is essential that there is sensitization of the need for good parenting skills and guidance is given to new parents in this regard.
A good parent is not a prefect parent but someone who strives to act and make decisions in the best interests of the child.
Children too, should be empowered to be alert of possible dangers in their homes and outside and how they could protect themselves.
Neighbours and other members too could get assistance where they feel that there is a child urgently in need of protection and care, by calling on the 24 hours toll-free Child Line 1929.
I highly appreciate the support of media organizations in highlighting the need to promote and protect the rights of children, according to a NCPA release.

Anti-dumping Bill will be soon in Parliament
"We are planning to present the draft Anti-dumping Bill to the Parliament very soon. Sri Lankan industries were assured that the FTAs being mooted will not affect them nor will it result in an imports dump that the domestic manufacturers are fearful of. In fact, the much sought after anti-dumping legislation was cleared by the Attorney General and is ready to head to the legislature, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said.
He was addressing the 26th AGM of Industry Association of Sri Lanka (IASL) at the Cinnamon Grand in Colombo on September 27.
Industries operate in challenging environments but with the help of Government agencies including the Trade Ministry, some of these were overcome, IASL Chairman Dinesh Dharmadasa said.
FTAs to be signed by Sri Lanka could bring forth numerous new challenges. We thank the Government for starting a dialogue with the industries and hope these dialogues will continue to facilitate viable operations of Sri Lankan Industries once the FTAs are signed and open up new opportunities for our members," he said.
He said any further liberation of trade has to be done after few basic safeguards like Anti-dumping legislation and lowering of duties of raw materials for local manufacture of finished products. Minister Bathiudeen said the industries in the country appeared to be worried about impacts of FTAs and dumping. "The unity government will not enter into such agreements without consulting local industries and without protecting them first. We are looking at new steps on anti-dumping and my officials are studying issues on this avenue. The Department of Commerce is a key institution working in this regard. We are planning to present the draft Anti-dumping Bill to Parliament in two-three weeks," he said.

Smart class concept to pilot modernised education system: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said the countrys education sector will be modernised in keeping with the 21st century.
The Prime Minister participating on an observational tour of the smart class introduced at Sri Jayawardenepura Maha Vidyalaya, Kotte said this concept pilots the modernised education system which will be established within the next 10 years.
As another step of modernisation, the government will provide tabs to Advanced Level students in the next year, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also said the proposed smart classrooms will be introduced to national schools around the country as well. Stressing the importance of information technology as a skill and a part of education, PM Wickremesinghe also said that it improves the human capital which is the largest resource Sri Lanka has.
We will also provide the necessary teacher training facilities to realise this task. The government is also to make 13 years of school education compulsory while adding more technical subjects to the secondary education curricula. Premier Wickremesinghe explained.
The Prime Minister stated that the concept of smart classes will be tested with vocational training institutes as well.
In a decades time, this new method will be fully available islandwide. the Prime Minister said.
PM Wickremesinghe observed that the modernisation of education should have taken place a decade ago.
When I was the Minister of Education in 1981-1982, we started providing computers to schools. But, unfortunately, even today, there are schools which lack computer facilities. The government took a decision to give tablets to school children in a background as such, Premier Wickremesinghe explained.
The Prime Minister pointed out that the government has taken steps to re-establish the position of school-inspector, grading of Principals with a proper legal procedure and assign teachers to difficult schools.
The Prime Minister also commended Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva for pioneering the concept of smart classes. He noted that any government, despite whoever the leading political party, holds the responsibility of promoting education. One of the main responsibilities taken up by this government is promoting education. We will do it in accordance with the 21 century we are in. the PM observed.
Premier Wickremesinghe also noted that the government did not have sufficient funds to implement this programme due to large debts and payment deficit Sri Lanka was suffering from.
However, we were able to implement this programme as a result of better economic conditions. Yet, the most difficult years for us will be 2017, 2018 and 2019. But, we will solve the issues and make progress and take the country forward, he added.

Space created for elders to join process of productivity
World Childrens and Elders Day messages:
Elders are the most experienced senior community of a country. They are the persons who bestow their years of experience, knowledge and good sense to the contemporary generations, stated President Maithripala Sirisena sending a message to mark World Elders Day.
The message stated: Though modern economic analyses define senior citizens as those who are over 65 years of age, without productivity, the victories achieved by modern medical sciences have endowed a productive elderly age to them. This has created space for the elders to join the process of productivity in the society.
According to the recent statistics on world population, the number of elder persons over 65 is increasing at a rapid pace. Sri Lanka is considered as a country with a higher number of elder persons. But this higher number of elder community has never been a burden to us as we have been in a family unit in which elders are taken care of within a warm relationship.
However, it is a common responsibility to provide services to them and look into their welfare needs, with a special attention paid on their mental and social requirements.
I congratulate on the celebration of International Day for Elder Persons, organized by the Ministry of Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage, and the National Secretariat for Elders, under the theme Stepping into the Future: Tapping the Talents, Contributions and Participation of Older Persons in Society.
I wish all endeavors made for creating a productive living space for elders a success!
A child is a universal symbol of purity and exquisiteness. All the children, wherever they are born or belong to whatever community, they are the creators of the future of the human beings, stated President Maithripala Sirisena sending a message marking World Childrens Day.
The message added: As responsible citizens we are bound to take steps in the development of the physical, mental as well as spiritual conditions of the children, following the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of the Child as well as to eliminate all the obstacles which are hindering the advancement of children.
I send my message of greetings to the Universal Children's Day special programmes organized by the Ministry of Hill Country New Villages Infrastructure and Community Development, with a great pleasure as it works with special commitment to create a new life for the children of the plantation communities, who live under most difficult social and economic conditions.
I commend the initiatives taken by the Ministry to provide solutions for the nutritional problems among the children of the plantation sector, and I wish every success to the endeavours of the Ministry of Hill Country New Villages Infrastructure and Community Development.

After 80 days and 20,093 shots, golfs longest hole is complete
When Adam Rolston sunk a seven-foot putt on the Mt Bogd Golf Club in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, he brought to a close a 2011-kilometer journey.
80 days ago, Rolston, along with caddy Ron Rutland, had set out on the opposite side of Mongolia in hope of playing the worlds longest hole of golf; 20,093 shots later, their dream had been realized.
But thats only part of the story. Terrible weather, testing terrain, stolen belongings, and ill-timed injuries meant the adventure hardly ran smoothly.
We estimated before that the par was going to be 14,000 shots and I think we were extremely nave with that, Rolston tells CNN.
We ended up playing 20,093 shots, so 6,093 over-par.
The world record, which raised money for Laureus Sport for Good, started in the far-west of Mongolia and finished in the countrys only golf course in the capital Ulaanbaatar. The two faced their own unique challenges. Each day, Rolston was hitting around 250 full-blooded golf shots, while Rutland pulled a 100kg cart of food, water, camping equipment, clubs and golf balls across 25 km of varied terrain, causing him to lose 16kg of weight over the 80 days.
THE HARDEST WEEK OF MY LIFE
Just a few days into the journey, Rolston admits the thought of quitting crossed his mind. The weather in the Altai mountains in the west of Mongolia posed the biggest challenge of the 80-day journey.
The first week was miserable, unbelievably miserable, it was the hardest week of my life. The terrain, the bog, it was raining so hard and the route was so boggy that the wheels were coming off the cart and I was knee-deep in mud and sleet.
Putting your tent up in rain and sleet and having to put on wet, cold shoes -- I dont think we saw sun for four days.
We were doing eight or nine kilometers a day when we had planned to do 25.
The pair also struggled with various injuries.
I was waking up at three in the morning with back spasms and just having to sit on a box. That was annoying but I knew it was only a temporary thing, says Rolston.
Ron had a hip issue. He had hip surgery about a year ago and his was much more of a chronic thing and hes probably going to have to go under some sort of surgical procedure.
MONGOLIA: UNREALIZED GOLF POTENTIAL
With its sparse desert plains, much of the Mongolian landscape offered the perfect environment for a lengthy round of golf.
Golf is a relatively unknown sport for many Mongolians, and Rutland and Rolston encountered plenty of intrigue on the way round. We started in the far west which was much more isolated, explains Rolston.
These guys had never seen golf before. Just seeing a white guy pulling a cart was a big thing, but to see another guy behind him hitting a little white pebble some 250 times a day was even more strange.
Its like Im [the magiciain] Houdini hitting these balls for miles. But Rolston would also let the locals take a few shots of their own, and the results, he explains, were impressive. Mongolian people ride horses a lot, they shoot bows on horses, they wrestle; theyre certainly not uncoordinated.
Some of the time you give them a golf club and they swing and hit it 100 yards ... That was pretty surprising.  CNN

Carew Cricket Club relegated after 'unfair' win over title rivals
A cricket club at the centre of a fair play row in a Welsh league has been relegated by a disciplinary committee.
Carew declared after scoring just 18 runs for one wicket against title rivals Cresselly in the final match of the Pembrokeshire league season.
The declaration meant their opponents could not win the league as they could not pick up enough bonus points and Carew went on to be crowned champions. Carew will remain as champions and have appealed against the relegation.
A disciplinary group was set up by Pembroke County Cricket Club (PCCC), which runs the game locally and launched the investigation following complaints.Carew started the day 21 points clear and with 20 points for a win, declared on 18-1 to deny Cresselly the chance of any batting or bowling bonus points so Carew won the title.
Officials said Carew did not technically break any rules, but the complaints led to the creation of a four-man disciplinary committee which looked into the team's actions. It decided to relegate Carew to Division Two but allowed them to remain as champions.The team's captain has also been told he is banned from starting the 2018 season, and the club was also fined 300.The club's appeal will be heard by the PCCC in the next few weeks. - BBC

Challenges before Yahapalana leadership
Though in general the pro-democracy mass movement believed it was the Mahinda group and the Executive Presidency that led to mega corruption, with an authoritative rule and ousting Mahinda regime would solve all problems, their hopes began to fade off soon after their victory. They were forced to accept that Yahapalanaya too included men of corruption and racism.
It is true that mass agitation and satyagraha was able to remove Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and others, but the reluctance of the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe social liberal Government to break off from the chauvinist Mahinda politics that drag this country into a further mess needs to be corrected. It is not possible to defeat Rajapaksa by running a marathon with him, simply because the man is off on a Sinhala Buddhist track.
Main crises the country is facing, is based on Sinhala Buddhist chauvinism. Latter has nothing to do with patriotism or Buddhist ethics. The unethical and insane public participation of Buddhist monks on the streets collecting money for penalties imposed by a Court of Law is a manifestation of fascistic politics of Mahinda group.
The Yahapalana leadership, either the President or the Prime Minister, must take this issue seriously enough to challenge that and tell the people, this is no issue for Buddhist monks to play politics with and it insults all true Buddhists. In spite of such friction, in Lanka, a radical overhaul is underway - of the political, economic, and social system. In another way, an unrecognized revolution is taking place. That means the upsurge of masses that took place two years back is still surging forward.
New Constitution
A new Constitution is being discussed, at the same time, a series of radical reforms are being rushed through. The fact that many of these reforms are being challenged as unconstitutional obviously indicates that the coming new Constitution is aimed at making what is un-Constitutional today, Constitutional tomorrow; making legal what is illegal by changing the fundamental laws of the country. Yes, this is a revolution without bloodshed, at least so far. It is the fundamental and inalienable right of the people to determine the economic, social, and political system in which they choose to live. This choice is their choice because it is freely made, not with a gun pointed at their heads. This is true for all nationalities living in Lanka.
Today, the world is maintained by G 2O agreement and Sri Lanka finds itself practically under a collective global power strategic objective and its global hegemony. This emerged after the international economic crisis after 2008. In spite of political changes taking place in the whole world including America, the international political balance of G 20 is still working.
It is indeed in this world reality that the US Ambassador chose to announce Washingtons decision to assist Sri Lanka draft its Constitution and implement the Human Rights Council resolution. We must remember the power of working masses of the frontline global powers expressed by leaders such as Bernie Sunders and Jeremy Corbyn. We are living in a world where the US depend on money and support given by China in difficult days. Gone are the days of US support ground forces on enemy territory and patrols provocatively close to China. It is also with Indian friendship that from Temple Trees the Acting US Assistant Secretary of State Alice Wells declared, last week, that the United States is  and will continue to be  an Indo-Pacific power. Anyone can see that rewriting the Constitution under such conditions can only advance the cause of all nationalities in Lanka and nothing else.
Of course there are guns pointed at Lanka due to the heinous crimes committed by fascistic Mahinda regime: the 2015 Human Rights resolution and the strict IMF/World Bank conditions including the populist political condition popularly known as Good Governance,' a grudging recognition by the global capital the power of masses for unity with the national interest. Yes, Good Governance' or Yahapalana as people know it here  was not invented by simpletons or potta Tamils following Mahinda.
The IMF, World Bank and the US Treasury coined the term in the late 1980s as to identify the project to deviate the revolutions and uprisings in the Third World to liberal ends; a political conditionality for keeping indebted Third World countries such as ours within the system of global capitalism.
'Good Governance' takes politics out of government and manages a shift from government to governance. By doing so, it has undermined the conflict between liberals and the left. For a limited period where national reconciliation and power sharing has been implemented, it neutralised identity conflicts, especially in multi-ethnic societies. One can find the same words in the Human Rights Council resolution and in the good governance conditionality: 'rule of law,' 'democracy,' devolution,' 'participation,' etc. These are the same positive words used eagerly by the Yahapalana regime.
Oppressed masses
In January 2016 last year, the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament that the purpose of the new Constitution was, in addition to national unification, to establish a political culture that respects the rule of law and strengthens democracy. The other aim of Good Governance is to convert the absolutist chauvinist State into effective and strong state agencies that guarantee the interests of the oppressed masses.
Populist and racist leaders in countries like ours misused elections to create racial and nationality conflicts. Such politics become a threat to democracy as minorities and displaced people shifted to use terrorism to challenge discrimination and differential treatment. Then anti-terror actions will be used by the state with the connivance of world powers, mainly US. This not only means that the State will no longer serve the public interest; it will actually be turned into a repressive State against the very people it must serve. This is exactly what happened in Lanka under fascistic Mahinda regime. Clearly, good governance should arrest such developments.
Even in America, Donald Trump came to power by using democratic elections; But American people today rising against the policies of Donald Trump using massive street campaigns. Even the World Bank admits that good governance could be anti-democratic, that it demands measures directed against the expectations of the majority of the people. In a 2002 report, the World Bank was explicit: Good governance requires the power to carry out policies and to develop institutions that may be unpopular among some - or even a majority - of the population.
In the previous presidential elections, Mahinda won and he started with dragging Marshal Fonseka to prison with torture. Almost everything done by that regime of Mahinda and Gotabhaya was wrong. Obviously, the majority doesnt mean good governance. Behind both these threats  the Human Rights Council resolution and the IMF/World Bank conditionality - is the same face: fascistic Mahinda. Lets be clear. The demands contained in the Human Rights Council resolution are not because Lanka was good, but Lanka happened to be cruel and racist under Mahinda.

Chandimal has mark of a great batsman  coach Pothas
ABU DHABI, Friday  Sri Lanka coach Nic Pothas praised the innings of skipper Dinesh Chandimal and said that he had the marks of a great batsman.
Chandi is a leader. He expects high standards from the team whether it is preparation or fielding or fitness. He sets some great example. I am very happy for him, said Pothas at the end of the second day.
We have worked a few things on his batting and he is very happy that those things have come good. That was a great Test match innings.
If you look at the last two knocks, against Australia in 2016 and against Bangladesh in 2017, those were quite similar. He is a free flowing batsman and the mark of a great batsman to adapt and he has certainly done that, he said.
Pothas was pleased by the application shown by the Lankan batsmen by batting for more than 150 overs and extending their first innings to the fifth session of the first Test before being dismissed for 419.
Its very pleasing to bat more than 150 overs as a team and that length of time. Its no secret that the wicket and outfield are slow. You can add another 50 or 60 runs to the total, said Pothas.
Very pleasing with the application shown by the boys, this is Test cricket and things dont happen at pace. Credit to the Pakistani bowlers they have been out there for a long time and they bowled well and fielded well.
You have to give credit to some of the unsung heroes. Kaushal Silva he scored only 12 but he was there for more than 70 minutes.
He took the spells off the opening bowlers and that takes the pressure off the middle order batters.
All those lower scores are there, but the impressive thing is that when people get in, they convert them into big scores. That is the mark of good batters.

Court grants special leave to appeal filed by SLMC
Challenging Appeal Court judgement to register student::
A majority of a divided Three-Judge-Supreme Court Bench yesterday, granted special leave to appeal a petition filed by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), challenging the judgement of the Court of Appeal to register a student of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) in Malabe provisionally as a medical practitioner in terms of Section 29(2) of the Medical Ordinance.
Accordingly, the Supreme Court fixed the matter for argument on November 13.
The Bench comprised Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice Anil Gooneratne.
The Supreme Court made order taking into consideration the lengthy submissions made by all parties in the appeal.
At a previous occasion, the Supreme Court had allowed the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) to intervene into the appeal filed by the SLMC.
Through this appeal petition, the SLMC sought an order to set aside the judgement dated January 31, 2017 by the Court of Appeal.
The petitioner further sought an interim order to stay the operation of the judgement made in the writ application bearing No. CA Writ 187/2016 by the Court of Appeal.
Delivering its judgement on the writ petition filed by a MBBS graduate of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) in Malabe, the Court of Appeal on January 31, held that SAITM is empowered to grant MBBS degrees and further held that the petitioner has legal rights to register at the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) as a medical practitioner in accordance with the Medical Ordinance.
The Court of Appeal had observed that the petitioner, a MBBS graduate of SAITM had no obstacle to register at the SLMC as a medical practitioner in terms of the Section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance. The Court of Appeal observed that on or around August 30, 2011, the former Higher Education Minister recognised SAITM as a degree awarding institute in terms of Section 25 (A) of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978. The Court of Appeal further observed that the Higher Education Minister had not taken any steps to revoke the concerned decision in terms of the Section 27 of the said Act.
SAITM is empowered to grant MBBS degrees, the Court observed.
In its judgment, the Court of Appeal observed that the SLMC had no power to take over the functions of the Higher Education Minister and further observed that the SLMC had acted in violation of Section 19 of the Medical Ordinance when making regulations relating to SAITM. The Court further held that the SLMC had acted in violation of the Medical Ordinance without having any powers to do so.

Disgraced US football star O.J. Simpson to be released from prison
Los Angeles: Disgraced American football star O.J. Simpson, whose racially charged 1995 murder trial riveted the nation, is expected to be released from prison as early as Monday after nine years behind bars for armed robbery.
Simpson, 70, plans to relocate to Florida following his release from the Lovelock Correctional Center, the medium-security prison in Nevada where he has been serving his sentence, said his lawyer, Malcolm LaVergne.
He is getting very, very excited, LaVergne told KTNV-TV in Las Vegas. Hes feeling very upbeat.
Simpson was granted parole at a hearing in July and his earliest release date was set for October 1. Since that falls on a Sunday, Simpson is expected to be freed no earlier than Monday, according to his lawyer and media reports. Simpson was found not guilty in 1995 of the grisly murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and a male companion, Ron Goldman, in a case that transfixed the country and became known as the Trial of the Century.
But the former National Football League running back and actor was sent to prison in 2008 for his role in an armed robbery the previous year of two sports memorabilia dealers at a Las Vegas resort. Simpson claimed at his trial that he was just seeking to recover personal items from the dealers and he repeated that explanation at his parole board hearing in July, where the four-member panel voted unanimously for his release.
At that hearing Simpson initially did not express any remorse for his actions but eventually offered that he was sorry that things turned out the way they did.
I had no intent to commit a crime, he said.
If I would have made a better judgment back then, none of this would have never happened.
LaVergne, Simpsons attorney, told KTNV-TV that the former NFL star planned to relocate to Florida, play golf and be around his friends and family.
LaVergne said he did not anticipate that Simpson would pose any problems. AFP

Drive to wean men off smoking
A five-year programme was launched in Colombo yesterday to reduce the number of men who smoke, to less than five percent by 2030 as one in every two Sri Lankan men is reported to be smoking.
Addressing the programme launching, WHO Representative to Sri Lanka Dr. Razia Pendse said the government has worked well to control the use of tobacco, and especially by introducing legislation. Sri Lanka is the first among 15 countries selected to launch the five-year programme.
British High Commissioner James Dauris said the UK grants US $ 20 million for the five-year programme.
The commitment displayed by the government is a major fact considered when selecting Sri Lanka as one of the 15 countries to implement the five-year programme.
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said part of the grant received from the UK will be used to assist 35,000 tobacco cultivators to abandon the cultivation and to commence another type of cultivation or another livelihood.
About 25,000 people die in Sri Lanka annually due to smoking. Five percent of them are children subjected to passive smoking, the Minister said.
Minister Senaratne said Sri Lanka has implemented 80 percent of pictorial warning on cigarette packets and 90 percent of tax on tobacco which is the highest in the world. Laws will be brought to introduce plain packaging, banning the sale of single cigarettes and banning the sale of cigarettes within a 500 metre radius of schools and places where children gather, he said.

Duterte thanks US for helping fight IS
THE PHILIPPINES: Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, a fierce critic of the United States, is now singing Washingtons praises for helping him fight pro-Islamic State group militants.
There are so many factors involved. But Id rather be friendly to them now, Duterte told residents of the central town of Balangiga during a visit, according to an official transcript released Friday.
Islamic militants waving the black IS flag occupied the southern city of Marawi on May 23, and have fought off a US-backed military assault for more than four months.
The US deployed a P-3 Orion spy plane and provided other intelligence inputs to Philippine forces trying to retake the city in fighting which has left more than 900 people dead.
I would not say that they were our saviours, but they are our allies and they helped us. And even today, they have provided the crucial equipment to our soldiers in Marawi to fight the terrorists, Duterte said Thursday.
So without their help also, we would be having a hard time, he said.
So we thank you. Duterte marked the start of his six-year term last year with foul-mouthed rants against the US as he steered his country away from the decades-old alliance while chasing trade and investment from Washingtons rival Beijing.
During a visit to China last October Duterte announced his separation from the United States, stating he was realigning with China and Russia instead.
Duterte explained that at the time, he was angry at then US President Barack Obama for criticising his centrepiece war on drugs, which has since seen at least 3,850 suspects shot dead by the police and thousands more killed by suspected vigilantes and others.
He had also denounced the US government over its bloody colonisation of the Philippines in the 1900s.
But these are all water under the bridge, Duterte said, citing the US alliance against Japans occupation army during World War II.
Manila won independence in 1945 after the war, with the two countries also signing a mutual defence treaty in 1951.

EU leaders look to digital future
ESTONIA: EU leaders will look to the blocs digital future at a summit in Tallinn on Friday, a day after debating wider plans unveiled by French President Emmanuel Macron to strengthen the union.
Macron is expected to seek to persuade sceptical counterparts to overhaul tax rules so that more of the profits from Silicon Valley giants like Facebook and Google fall into Europes public coffers.
The proposal was part of a wider vision that the 39-year-old leader unveiled in a landmark speech in Paris on Tuesday, aimed at reviving a European project hurt by Brexit, populism and the migration crisis.
At dinner in the Estonian capital on Thursday, EU national leaders held a debate about Macrons plans.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the EUs most powerful leader, indicated her support for Macrons new vision.
There is a wide agreement between France and Germany when it comes to the proposals, although we must work on the details, Merkel said.
The leaders discussed the ideas -- over courses of flank steak, salmon and rabbit liver -- in a very constructive and positive atmosphere, an EU source told AFP.
Based on the discussion, European Council President Donald Tusk, who coordinates EU summit meetings, will consult with his colleagues in the coming two weeks and propose how to take the work forward, the EU source added.
British Prime Minister Theresa May was also present for the summit, and was set to meet Merkel for a bilateral discussion on Friday as well as a visit to a NATO military base with Macron. Brexit negotiations, however, were not on the official menu.
The summit will discuss the opportunities and dangers of the digital economy, as well as cybersecurity.
The tax push by France, already backed by Germany, is part of a wider regulatory onslaught by the EU on Google and other US tech behemoths.
In his closely watched speech on Europe Tuesday, Macron thundered against high tech companies that had become the freeloaders of the modern world.
Macrons proposal seeks to tax digital multinationals on the revenue generated in an EU country, instead of on profits booked in a low-tax EU HQ, often Ireland or Luxembourg.
So far about a dozen of the EUs 28 member states have signed on to the idea, though many urge action to take place on a global level, instead of just in Europe.
But smaller EU states have expressed strong resistance to the idea, which they say will chase US tech giants from their shores, especially Ireland, which serves as a low-tax hub for Apple, Facebook and Google.
The hope is to have a formal proposal by December that would be made into law in 2018.
Britain meanwhile has warned that the new tax may anger Washington, which could abandon tax reform in retaliation.
Several national authorities in the EU have opened up tax fights with Google, Airbnb and other Internet giants.
The discussion on a digital tax is one component of a full day of talks by EU leaders that will also touch upon cybersecurity and the free flow of data in the Europe. - AFP

Exhibition to celebrate Australia - Sri Lanka cooperation
Australian High Commissioner Bryce Hutchesson launched a photographic exhibition at the Jaffna Art Gallery on September 27 celebrating 70 years of development cooperation between Australia and Sri Lanka.
Australia has long supported Sri Lankas development island-wide, including in the North. The exhibition highlights how Sri Lankans have benefited from the humanitarian, health, education and employment projects delivered by Australian aid.
Partnerships with all levels of government, civil society, the private sector and NGOs have been central to the success of these programmes, said Hutchesson. Since the end of the conflict, Australia has provided assistance for demining, new housing, rebuilding of schools, roads, market places and created new jobs. Similarly, post-tsunami, Australia assisted with a range of reconstruction efforts.
The exhibition also captures the future of Australias development cooperation in Sri Lanka.
Many of our new programmes focus on partnering with the private sector in innovative ways to create more and better jobs and opportunities for all Sri Lankans, especially women, said Hutchesson.
The exhibition also celebrates, with a series of select portraits, the significant contribution Sri Lankans have made to Australian society. These portraits showcase just a small representation of the large and vibrant Sri Lankan community that has contributed so significantly and positively to Australias multicultural life, said Hutchesson.
The exhibition is open to the public from September 27 to October 1 at the Jaffna Art Gallery.

Incidental catching of dolphins using Longline method:
The US authorities will impose a ban on Sri Lankas fish exports if the fishing community using the Longline fishing method does not take measures to prevent Dolphins from getting trapped in their nets, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Addressing officials at the Advisory Committee meeting at the Ministry recently, Minister Amaraweera said there is a risk of the United States imposing ban on Sri Lankan fish exports to the US due to the absence of a proper mechanism to avoid incidental catching and killing of dolphins.
The Minister has directed the Ministry Secretary to take measures to import new devices used to prevent incidental catching and killing of dolphins in other countries and distribute them, free of charge to all fishermen engaged in long line fishing, by next year.
According to the International Fisheries Law, catching and killing of dolphins has been banned.

He made these remarks yesterday in response to the comments of several Maha Nayaka Theras,participating in a ceremony held at Gemunupura in Ampara.
President Sirisena also said that several nayake theras had commented to the media, that the new constitution is to be drafted based on Federalism, which is incorrect.
I phoned Jayampathi Wickramaratne and inquired about the truth of this statement, the President said.
He said that nothing will consist in the constitution that will dilute the foremost position given to Buddhism. I asked his twice and he assured me that such clauses will not be included in the constitution.
He also said that the former President had said that there should be a new constitution for power devolution.

Heart to heart
Heart disease is the number one killer worldwide among Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), with more than 17 million deaths annually. But what this statistic does not tell you is the sheer number of people saved by coronary non-invasive and surgical procedures every year. Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PCTA) or Stenting as it is popularly known is a relatively easy non-invasive procedure that can open up clogged heart vessels. With the cost of stents coming down on the instructions of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne and the Government funding the entire cost of the procedure at state hospitals, more heart patients in Sri Lanka have received a new lease of life.
The other option, reserved for more serious patients, is Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG), where the chest is usually opened up and the patient connected to the heart-lung machine while the surgeons complete the bypassing with a vessel from another part of the patients body. In some cases, it is possible to operate on the heart without stopping it through a small incision on the chest (Laparoscopy or keyhole surgery), but not all patients are suitable for this operation.
However, there are rare cases when all these procedures are not suitable. This is especially applicable for patients with a congenital disorder (birth defect) in the heart. The only answer for most of these patients is a heart transplant, possibly from a young, disease-free donor.
Heart transplants are nothing new. The first heart transplant operation was performed exactly 50 years ago. On December 3, 1967, 53-year-old Lewis Washkansky received the first human heart transplant at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. Washkansky, a South African grocer dying from chronic heart disease, received the transplant from Denise Darvall, a 25-year-old woman who was fatally injured in a car accident. Surgeon Christiaan Barnard, who trained at the University of Cape Town and in the United States, performed the revolutionary medical operation. Today, heart transplants are fairly common all over the world and the only drawback is the relative lack of donor hearts.
Although our doctors have been performing PCTA and CABG procedures locally for nearly 20 years, a heart transplant had eluded Sri Lanka until just a couple of months ago. Thirty-six-year-old mother of one Pushpa Kumari from Anuradhapura had only a few months to live with her ailing heart. Doctors knew that short of a miracle, the only option was a heart transplant. Dr. Anil Abeywickrama, who had undergone training in this sector in the UK, and the team of surgeons in Kandy were ready to undertake the surgery. All they needed was a donor heart. This came from Pradeep Kumara Sampath, a 24-year-old youth from Udunuwara who died in a motorcycle accident. In a groundbreaking operation, this team of doctors successfully completed the first successful heart transplant in Sri Lanka.
Just two months later, the same of team of doctors have performed the second successful heart transplant. The lucky recipient is 19-year-old Sachini Sewwandi of Aluthgama, who now has the heart that once belonged to 28-year-old Nalinda Sakalasuriya of Thalathuoya, another victim of a road accident. It was heartbreaking to watch Nalindas father speaking on television, saying that his son will now literally live on in a young girl who has her whole life ahead of her. And someone else will see through his eyes too.
Indeed, the entire nation should be grateful to the parents of Pradeep and Nalinda, who readily and graciously offered to provide the vital organs of their sons to total strangers. They did not receive or expect to receive any kind of compensation for this noble deed. The knowledge that someone else will live with the organs of their offspring was their only satisfaction, only reward.
But there could be critical time bound cases where even the delay caused by seeking a guardians consent could prove to be crucial for the recipient. There is a suggestion to allow health authorities to harvest the organs of young persons killed in road accidents for critically ill patients awaiting transplants without first seeking the consent of parents or guardians. Time is of the essence for transplants and even a slight delay could prove to be fatal for a recipient. Serious consideration should thus be given to this proposal. The authorities should also create more awareness on organ donation.
However, future developments may obviate the need for human organ donors altogether. There are two approaches  silicon-based artificial hearts and hearts obtained from pigs, an animal which has remarkably similar anatomical features. An artificial heart which closely imitates the real thing in form and function has been developed by Swiss researchers. In the other process, called xenotransplantation, genetically engineered pig hearts could be transplanted to humans. Experiments with other primates have already shown good results. However, there are ethical dilemmas surrounding this solution  is it moral to kill another being to get its organs for our use In any case, both these methods could take a couple of decades to become perfect. In the meantime, human transplants will get more widespread and more reassuring.

I taught Federer how to win - Martina Hingis
Much has been made of the resurgence of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal this season.
Aged 36 and 31 respectively, both have defied the odds to collect two grand slam titles.
But another legend of the game, who is 10 months Federer's senior, has just sealed two grand slam titles in the space of 24 hours.
Martina Hingis, 36, won the women's doubles and the mixed doubles at the recent US Open, taking her overall grand slam total to 25. She partnered with Taiwan's Chan Yung-Jan to win the women's doubles title and Briton Jamie Murray to win the mixed doubles tournament.
In doing so, she returned to the scene of her first US Open singles triumph, recorded against an emergent Venus Williams exactly two decades ago.
It has been a "wonderful journey," to quote Hingis herself, beginning with a debut on the WTA Tour just a week after turning 14, and showing no signs of stopping as her 37th birthday approaches.
"I've always loved to play tennis," Hingis told CNN Sport's Don Riddell. "This is what I do best; this it what I know; this is my education since I was two years old."
ANKLE INJURIES
The Swiss remains the youngest grand slam champion in history -- having won the Wimbledon women's doubles aged 15 years and 282 days alongside Helena Sukov, a partner twice her age.
And she remains the youngest singles grand slam winner in the Open era -- having reached all four major finals in 1997, only missing out at Roland Garros.
"I was the youngest in most of the things I did," says Hingis.
"Now, I look back at it and see [today's] juniors and young upcoming players ...You say 'Oh Jelena Ostapenko, when she won the French Open she was only 20 years old!'
"And I'm like hang on ... Back then when you were 20, if you hadn't won a grand slam by then you were almost too old!"
Hingis became the undisputed world No. 1 aged 16 and it was a position she held on and off at the top of women's tennis for a total of 209 weeks -- the fifth longest of all time -- until a series of ankle injuries forced her to retire aged 22.
Had she done too much too young
"In my case I definitely wouldn't want to change what I went through with anyone," says Hingis. "It's a lot cooler than having to go to school."
"I did education until I was 14 when I turned pro and then some later on as well, but I think this is the best education you can get.
"My mom always made sure that when we traveled to different cities and countries that we also took something from there to learn about."
A FLEETING RETURN
Hingis came out of retirement and returned to the ATP Tour in 2006, duly lifting the Australian Open mixed doubles trophy with India's Mahesh Bhupathi.
But, hampered by injury, she was never again the same electrifying talent and, on 1 November 2007, the "Swiss Miss" announced her retirement for a second time following a positive test for metabolites of cocaine.
The former darling of women's tennis was banned by the International Tennis Federation for two years and, though she refuted the charges, this time it really did look like the end.
"I believe her when she says she's retiring permanently," commented Larry Scott, the chairman and chief executive of the WTA at the time.
THIRD TIME LUCKY
And yet once again Hingis was not to be denied.
Since returning to the WTA Tour in 2013, she has won 10 further doubles grand slam titles and insists her only major regret is relinquishing control of the 1997 French Open singles final to Croatia's Iva Majoli.
Twenty three years after her WTA debut, the game has changed but Hingis's inimitable desire to win remains the same.
And her longevity means there are few players better positioned to appreciate the grand sweep of women's tennis history.
"Sometimes I did complain that I want to see a bit more variety and a little bit of strategy in the game," she said.
"You see that more in the men's tennis, but eventually women will return to that.
"Once you are able to control that power, [you] have the variety out there again. Sometimes I think that's forgotten.
"Hey, tennis is a game. It's not just sheer power!"
Many players, both male and female, have looked up to Hingis during her long and storied career -- not least Federer himself.
"I always say I taught him how to win his first tournament," she laughs, reflecting on their mixed doubles victory at the 2001 Hopman Cup. "We ended up winning Sydney too the week after.
"There were some great moments we shared. We all know what happened afterwards." - CNN

## Title: Ill-advised night out in Bristol could bring back the Botham batcave

Ill-advised night out in Bristol could bring back the Botham batcave
Apart from the odd selection quandary  like who bats at No2, No3 or No5 in the Test team  the garden was looking so rosy. The side have won both series this summer and West Indies have been thrashed in a couple of one-day international matches. Thirty years ago a victory against West Indies in any format might have been worthy of a big night out. That is hardly the case now but Ben Stokes was out and about in Bristol on Sunday night with Alex Hales in his wake and something went wrong. Those English roses have wilted rapidly in the past 24 hours.
So what is the fallout That depends partly on the investigations of the Avon and Somerset police. Whatever the outcome it is not good news that Englands vice-captain has been arrested. The timing of such an incident is never going to be convenient but the breaking of this news came on the day the selectors were meeting to pick their squad for Australia.
Ostensibly that is good news for Hales, who would be a borderline selection. However, the cautionary tale of John Morris comes to mind. He was David Gowers co-pilot during the infamous Tiger Moth flight in Queensland in 1991. While Gower went on to play more Test cricket Morris was never seen again in any format. A peripheral cricketer has to have a more impeccable CV than a superstar. That may not be fair, but thats life.
The best-case scenario for England is that Stokes will be free to tour Australia this winter and that the Bristol incident is soon consigned to the dustbin like the 2013 Walkabout fracas in Birmingham involving David Warner eventually was  although Warner was suspended by Cricket Australia in the immediate aftermath. Warner is now the Australia vice-captain, he does not drink and has acquired the nickname of Rev, a sequence of events not yet mirrored precisely by Stokes.
But even the best-case scenario is far from ideal. Australia is a wonderful place to tour; it can also be tricky. For those who like to go out there are attractions galore plus countless mobile phones to record any indiscretions, and any high-profile Pom at a bar generally has to be provoked as a matter of principle. Stokes will have to be on guard from Townsville (perhaps especially in Townsville) to Sydney.
We can travel no further without a comparison with Sir Ian Botham, who managed to spend the eve of the 1988 Sheffield Shield final in a Perth prison before taking the field for Queensland the following day. Stokes always prompts these comparisons and they are nearly always flattering; these two have much in common as cricketers and characters. Both, I suspect, need to let their hair down now and again, though I can reveal this with more authority in the case of Botham.
In the end Botham hit upon a means of survival in Australia. On the 1986-87 tour he created his batcave, a substantial suite in the team hotel where he spent convivial evenings with friends and team-mates. He could not risk going out. It would be a shame if Stokes was reduced to a similar arrangement so early in his career. This winter, assuming he makes the trip, he will need to be careful and his mates in the team  and there are plenty of them  will have to keep an eye on him. Englands vice-captain cannot afford any misdemeanour on or off the field.
Haless situation is not so serious but very uncomfortable. He has missed an ODI because he voluntarily went to Bristol to give evidence to the police, which cannot be a pleasant experience. And despite the instructions of Strauss this incident is hardly likely to enhance his chances of selection for the Ashes tour. On the broader front England may have to address their laissez-faire attitude to team discipline. In the post Andy Flower era the system is essentially one of self-governance, where the players take responsibility for how they behave; they can set their own parameters. This is the best way but after a couple of aberrations it becomes unworkable.
Strauss and Trevor Bayliss, who seldom comes across as a natural disciplinarian and whose admiration of Stokes knows few bounds, now have a stern reminder to be on guard once that plane lands in Perth at the end of October.  theguardian

IMF UPBEAT ON SRI LANKAS ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
HAILS NEW Inland Revenue Act:
Sri Lanka was given a positive outlook to its economic reform program by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) yesterday.
The IMF mission ended its two week long visit by a staff team to hold discussions on the third review of the countrys three year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program.
Sri Lanka, they said had satisfactorily met the IMFs EFF programs targets and policy performance in terms of fiscal, monetary and reserve accumulation have been strong.
Special mention was made of the governments recent introduction of the Inland Revenue Act (IRA), a move championed by the IMF and one that is expected to increase government revenue and make the countrys tax system more transparent and simple.
The IMF mission chief, Jaewoo Lee addressing a media briefing held at the Central Bank acknowledged that the government has had a challenging year which has led to overall macroeconomic growth being mixed.
Growth has been subdued and inflationary pressures have increased reflecting the drought since 2016 and floods earlier this year, said Lee.
The IMF thus projected the economic growth rate to remain below 4.5 percent for 2017 but expected it to pick up in 2018 as agricultural production normalises next year.
This was confirmed by Central Bank Governor Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy this week who expected overall growth to remain between 4 to 4.5 percent this year.
The IMF however projected the current account deficit to widen this year due to higher imports of fuel and food caused by the drought.
In addition, the Central Banks predicted budget deficit of 5 percent of GDP, according to Lee was high due to increased government debt and resulting high interest rates.
Capital inflows have been positive as market confidence grows and this has allowed the government to meet the IMFs international reserve targets.
As the government awaits a decision on the fourth tranche of the USD 1.5 billion IMF EFF program as the end result of this review, Lee highlighted areas the government could further improve on.
The government needs to look at further strengthening debt management and having a systematic debt management strategy will help. It is also important that the Central Bank continue with the recent phase of reserve accumulation to improve stability. Commitment to greater exchange flexibility and inflation targets is also important, said Lee.
More importantly the IMF, similar to its first and second reviews, asked that the government accelerate the phase of implementation of public financial management and reform in State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). Pricing formulas for fuel and electricity too figured prominently in the discussions between the IMF and the government,
The government has said this is very much a priority and we hoped to see a formula for fuel by March 2018 and one for electricity by September 2018, said the IMF Mission Chief.

Japans economic data boosts Abe ahead of vote
JAPAN: A raft of broadly positive economic data gave Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe a boost on Friday, as he kicked off an election campaign in which the health of the world's third-biggest economy will play a major role.
Factory output grew more than expected while household spending -- seen as key for Japan's exit from years of deflation -- edged up and the unemployment rate sat at a more than two-decade low.
Japan's industrial production growth came in at 2.1 percent in August, the latest evidence of an economic recovery, capping off six straight quarters of gains in the April-June period -- the longest winning streak in over a decade. The country's prospects have recently improved with investments linked to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics giving the economy a shot in the arm.
"On the whole, the data show the Japanese economy is on a healthy path" to recovery, said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, adding that the latest factory output figure was "especially good."
UBS economist James Malcolm added: "In short, things are on track".
Abe stunned Japan this week with a surprise call for a snap election, seeking to capitalise on a weak opposition and a boost in the polls, as voters welcome his hawkish policy toward neighbouring North Korea which has launched missiles over Japan.
The Premier, who dissolved Parliament Thursday, claimed that his government "put an end" to Japan's decades-long economic slump after he took office in late 2012 in a landslide election victory.
He rose to power on a mission to kick-start Japan's once-booming economy with a policy blitz known as "Abenomics," a combination of big government spending, ultra-loose monetary policy and structural reforms.
But while it fattened corporate profits and sent the stock market higher, it has failed in the goal of shrugging off the deflation that has plagued Japan for years and held back growth.
However, the inflation data was not such good news for Abenomics.
After stripping out volatile prices for fresh food, inflation was at 0.7 percent, according to the internal affairs ministry -- the eighth straight month of price rises and the highest in over two years.
But that is still nowhere near the Bank of Japan's 2.0-percent target, despite years of record monetary easing by the Bank of Japan. The unemployment rate stood at 2.8 percent.

LAWSUIT DISMISSED
Re-instatement of mr as SLFP Chairman :
Preliminary objections raised by defendants upheld:
A lawsuit filed by two individuals seeking an order to re-instate former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was yesterday dismissed by the Colombo District Court.
Colombo District Judge Sujeewa Nissanka upheld the preliminary objections raised by defendants and decided to dismiss the lawsuit in limine.
This lawsuit had been filed by two Plaintiffs, former Boralesgamuwa Urban Council Chairman K.D. Aruna Priyasantha and Asanka Nandana Srinath, citing the SLFP General Secretary and the Election Commission Chairman as defendants.
The SLFP General Secretary through his Counsel had raised preliminary objections citing that there is no legal basis to proceed with the case. In his preliminary objections, the SLFP General Secretary stated that plaintiffs are indirectly challenging the acts of the current President of the republic done in his capacity as the SLFP Chairman.
It is common ground that the Chairman of the SLFP is the President of the Republic. In terms of Article 35(1) of the Constitution, the President of the Republic has immunity from suit except in an action filed in terms of Article 126 of the Constitution, the SLFP General Secretary added.
The defendants further submitted that the District Court has no jurisdiction to file action against the Election Commissioner.
The second defendant Anura Priyadarshana has resigned from his position as the General Secretary of SLFP and cannot be named as party defendant in this action.
The caption of the action identified third defendant as Sunanda Deshapriya, the Election Commissioner. There is no person who can be reasonably identified as such and in fact no such person used to act as the Elections Commissioner, the SLFP General Secretary further added.
The SLFP General Secretary maintained that the plaintiffs are seeking to circumvent the provisions of immunity from suit accorded to the President of the Republic and as such the plaintiffs action is liable to be dismissed in limine.
The plaintiffs alleged that the former SLFP General Secretary Anura Priyadarshana Yapa had sent a letter to the EC on or around January 16, 2015 over the appointment of a new SLFP Chairman.
The plaintiffs further alleged that the Executive Committee of the Party without holding a proper committee meeting, had taken the decision to make new appointments to the SLFP leadership.
Presidents Counsel Chandaka Jayasundara with Counsel Pulasthi Rupasinghe and Lanka Dharmasiri appeared for SLFP General Secretary. Senior Counsel Nimal Weerakkody appeared for the plaintiffs.

Local big onion farmers in hot water
The tax on imported big onions has been increased by one hundred percent by the government with immediate effect. But, the price of indigenous big onions is still the same. Its price is less than Rs. 40 per kilo, the farmers said.
Currently, the Dambulla Dedicated Economic Centre is receiving indigenous big onions while imported onions are freely available in the market.
Due to the inclement weather, big onion cultivation during the current season had reduced.
The farmers had cultivated less than 2,000 acres in the district, while it is not sufficient at all. Hence, they had to shoulder a huge expense for the big onion cultivation. However, the anticipated big onion harvest could not be obtained in the current season. Meanwhile, its price has also dropped sharply.
Moreover, the businessmen have stocked onions in large quantities and is gradually releasing their stocks to the market.
Therefore, it is directly influencing the price of indigenous big onions.
Under this situation, the local farmers are in hot water and are helpless. The new tax increase has only benefited the businessmen because they have now stocked imported big onions sufficiently.
Therefore, the farmers urge the government to take immediate action to purchase the indigenous big onions from the local farmers at a reasonable rate.

Magnificent captains knock (155 n.o.) by Chandimal
Sri Lanka 419; Pakistan 64/0 :
ABU DHABI, Friday  Sri Lankas Test captain Dinesh Chandimal has made it his habit of producing centuries under duress and yesterday at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium he played one of the most important knocks of his career to steer his team towards a competitive total in the first Test against Pakistan.
Chandimals innings of 155 not out was the cornerstone on which Sri Lanka built their first innings total of 419 after they were at one stage 61-3 and the ghosts of the recent past of their whitewash against India threatening to raise its head again.
By the close of the second day Pakistan had survived the wiles of wrist spinner Lakshan Sandakan to be 64 without loss, with Shan Masood (31) and Sami Aslam (30) both unbeaten.
It is not the first time that Chandimal had produced an innings of great character having done so against Bangladesh where he rallied his team from 70-4 to 338 with an innings of 136, then against Australia last year when he made 132 off 356 balls after Sri Lanka had slipped to 26-5, and that memorable match winning knock of 162 in the second innings against India at Galle in 2015 on an awkward pitch.
Yesterdays knock was more pleasing because it was Chandimals first as captain and also his first against a testing Pakistan bowling attack that had the likes of world class bowlers Mohammad Amir and Yasir Shah and the vastly improved Hasan Ali.
In terms of endurance and skill especially in the oppressive heat, this knock would rank as one of his best so far in his promising career. It was faultless and the only time Pakistan came close to dismissing Chandimal was when he survived an lbw decision at 58 on the first day when he shouldered arms to Mohammad Abbas and successfully reviewed it and when he was bowled off an Abbas no-ball at 154.
In wicket-keeper Niroshan Dickwella, Chandimal found an able ally and the pair frustrated the Pakistan bowlers in a fifth wicket stand of 134 that laid the foundation for their total.
The pair resumed from the overnight score of 227-4 and batted almost the entire second morning session. Dickwella the aggressor in the partnership completed his half century off 67 balls (6 fours, 1 six) but could not carry on further than 83  his highest Test score when he played onto a delivery from Hasan Ali much to his disappointment. He hit nine fours and a six in his 117-ball innings.
Like Dimuth Karunaratne on the first day who helped his captain add 100 for the fourth wicket, Dickwella proved his worth at number six. His wicket was the only success for Pakistan as Sri Lanka took lunch at 322-5 with Chandimal going strong on 122, having completed his ninth Test century off 273 balls (11 fours) with an expansive cover drive for four off Amir.
If Pakistan thought they were into the Lankan tail they were sadly mistaken because Dilruwan Perera  no mean cricketer with the bat (he has a highest Test score of 95 on his Test debut against Pakistan at Sharjah in 2014) stuck it out for a useful 33 off 117 balls to help Chandimal help further consolidate the total to 387.
Perera scored his first runs after 32 balls having survived two successful lbw reviews that went against him. He provided debutant Haris Sohail with his maiden Test wicket.
Abbas ensured the Sri Lankan tail didnt create anymore frustrations to the Pakistan bowlers by capturing three of the last four wickets that left him with the chance of performing the hat-trick if he picks up a wicket with his first ball of the Sri Lankan second innings.
Leg-spinner Yasir Shah was made to work hard for his three wickets sending down a marathon 57 overs for 120 runs.

Moves to boost hybrid seed production
The government has taken steps to promote the production of hybrid seeds and to introduce the technology to farmers with the help of Bangladesh.
Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said the ministry has signed an MOU with the Bangladesh Lalteers seeds production company to launch the project, including the exchange of seed production technology. He said the country spends Rs. 1,400m to import hybrid seeds annually. The country has not achieved self-sufficiency in seed requirement even 105 years after establishing the Agriculture Department, he said.
The Minister said the Lalteers company was supposed to be the world's biggest seed production company possessing genetic resources.
He said a seed production building complex, including an agriculture laboratory, will be established at the Mahailuppallama Agriculture Research and Development Centre and the farm. The Minister said 300 acres of the farm has not been utilised for any purpose during the last four decades.

Mumbai commuter stampede leaves many dead
INDIA: A commuter stampede on a Mumbai railway bridge during the morning rush hour Friday killed at least 22 people, officials said.
Dozens of people took shelter on the bridge during a sudden monsoon downpour and the deadly crush started as they emerged all at once, Indian Railways spokesman Anil Saxena said.
Avinash Supe, dean of KEM Hospital, told AFP there were 22 dead.
There was a huge crowd on the FOB (foot overbridge). Everybody tried to leave at once and it appeared one of them slipped and fell, triggering the stampede, Saxena told reporters.
The bridge connects the Elphinstone and Parel stations in south Mumbai.
The toll is likely to rise further, a disaster management cell spokesman warned. It was the peak hour rush but the stampede has been brought under control, Tanaji Kamble told AFP.
TV footage showed commuters trying to revive the injured by pumping their chests and also carrying some down stairs to street level.
We put everybody who was injured in cars, police vans and ambulances and tried to take them to the hospital as quickly as possible, said one witness.
There were 3-4 women who were badly injured, I don't know whether they survived.
Local trains are the lifeline for the 20 million people of Mumbai. Some 7.5 million commuters take the train daily, with services running every three minutes on average.
Hundreds die every year due to losing their grip on the doors, falling while trying to get into packed compartments, hitting electric poles outside or doing stunts while hanging off the train. Official figures say some 3,400 people died in 2016 either from falling off the trains or while crossing the tracks of what is the world's most overcrowded suburban rail network.
Stampedes at India's religious festivals are also common with police and volunteer stewards often overwhelmed by the sheer size of the crowds.
In January, six women died in West Bengal state and last year 24 people were killed after a stampede broke out in the Hindu holy town of Varanasi.

Parties lack capacity to analyse political situation:DEW
Sri Lanka Communist Party, General Secretary D. E. W. Gunasekera said yesterday, that there is no capacity in Sri Lankan political parties to intellectually and scientifically analyse a political situation in the country. Even political leaders were not so concerned about statistics and scientific analysis based on the political situation and the peoples aspirations.
He was addressing the gathering at the 21st National Congress of the Communist Party of Sri Lanka held in Colombo yesterday. He said this had resulted in political parties facing many crisis.
Political parties should realize the aspirations of the people. No political party thought that there would be a massive public movement in 2015. But, the last National Congress - 20th Congress which was held three years ago in July 2014 correctly analysed the prevailing political situation and warned the previous government of emerging trends and a possible new alignment of social forces.
I personally discussed with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa not to call for the Presidential election in 2015 two years before the scheduled time.
Although he did not listen to us, our conclusion was proved by the 2015 Presidential election.
Our speculation was not based on any astrological calculation, but on a scientific analysis of the prevailing political trends and possible shifts in the balance of social forces.
After the General Election, the shift was pronouncedly seen with sections of the SLFP joining the unity government, while the rest remaining in the Opposition as a separate group named the Joint Opposition. No single party had a clear majority in Parliament and a UNP - SLFP unity government came into being.
Thereafter, the political situation became fluid, complex and confusing.

Peruvian Govt., church clash over Papal visit
PERU: Perus government and Roman Catholic clergy are quarreling over a planned visit by Pope Francis in a spat blending politics and fears over earthquakes.
The question is where the Pope should say a huge outdoor mass when he visits in January.
The church originally picked a beach on the bay off Lima. It is a lovely spot but also features 80-meter (260-foot) cliffs and only four evacuation routes in case of an earthquake in tremor-prone Peru.
Peru has on average around 200 quakes a year, most of them under magnitude 6. The last big one -- magnitude 7.9 in 2007 -- killed nearly 600 people.
So the government, which has final say over all this and has yet to make up its mind, wants the pope to say mass on the tarmac of a military airport. But the church says the government has a hidden motive for the switch: to slight the archbishop of Lima, Juan Luis Cipriani, a leader of the ultra-conservative movement Opus Dei in Latin America.
If the mass is held at the military airport, Cipriani will not be able to concelebrate mass with the Pope. Instead, the honor will go to the top military chaplain at the base.
An official in the archbishops office speaking on condition of anonymity said leftist, anti-clerical sectors, critics of the archbishop within the government... do not want Cipriani to take part in the mass.
The chairwoman of the council of ministers, Mercedes Araoz, said it was important to choose a spot where people will be safe in case of an earthquake.

Children whose future lies in the world of tomorrow and the elderly who are spending the evening of their lives today, are the focus of the UN Day for Children and Elders, stated Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in a message marking World Childrens and Elders Day.
The message added: While being conscious of the need to protect our children and be attentive to their requirements, we also must to be able to understand and respond to the issues facing them. Treating them with love and care is a responsibility that falls on us as a society, towards empowering them to face the challenges of tomorrow with success.
Taking care of our elderly is not only a duty but a cherished tradition we have been maintaining over centuries. The need of the hour is to build a community that is receptive towards taking proper care of the elderly, creating an atmosphere of love and compassion.
It is our common responsibility to come together to understand and respond to the needs of children and the elderly in a manner that makes them feel wanted and taken care of.
I take this opportunity to wish everyone a meaningful Children and Elders Day.

Restore the status of Translators!
International Translation Day falls today:
The United Nations Organization, at its 71st Session held on May 24, has declared 30th September as the International Translation Day recognizing the invaluable service Translators are rendering in bringing about inter-ethnic harmony and national reconciliation. In that resolution, the UNO affirms that professional translation, as a trade and an art, plays an important role in upholding the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, bringing nations together, facilitating dialogue, understanding and cooperation, contributing to development and strengthening world peace and security. The resolution also states as its purpose the need to recognize Translator service in terms of the role it performs in bridging the communication gap between different communities, in particular in post-conflict contexts in countries which have suffered long drawn out inter-ethnic disharmonies.
It is in this backdrop that the declaration of International Translation Day matters so much to Sri Lankans and Sri Lanka, in particular as a country which suffered for three decades a bloody war caused, for the most part, by a language issue, resulting in loss of hundreds of thousands of valuable lives. Further, we gather that a function has been organised to celebrate this day headed by Minister Mano Ganesan who has shown much interest in bringing about national reconciliation. However, the true situation of Government Translators Service in Sri Lanka is a story of disappointment where these professionals are suffering endless degradations and step-motherly treatments at the hand of certain authorities never giving them their due status and recognition in spite of re-iterations even by the Cabinet of Ministers by the Official Languages Policy passed in year 2013 that immediate measures have to be adopted to address the present issue of qualified translators leaving the service and skilled personnel being not interested in entering this Service.
Government Translators are graduates who enter the service by passing a highly competitive examination conducted to test their inter-lingual competence. Upto year 2006 the Graduate Recruitment Class (Class I) of the service had been placed at a status parallel to that of an Administrative Officer in a Department while its Promotion Class (Special Class) had been placed in Executive level.
However, with introduction of Public Administration Circular 06/2006, both Classes of the Service were placed at a level much below the level of Administrative Officer and Special Class was made deprived of its Executive Status. Accordingly, from year 2006 onwards, utterly frustrated of the downright degradation of their status, many qualified translators vacated their post while other qualified personnel outside the service who were desirous of joining this service were discouraged to enter it. Many parliamentarians of the present government, as members of the Opposition under the previous regime, pointed out this deplorable situation in Parliament and, as a result, the Cabinet of Ministers, by the above said Language Policy Decision, recognized the need to restore Translators the status stripped off them.
Keeping to the pledges made, and in response to the persistent explanations by Translators Service Union, the Present Government took steps to restore the status Translators lost with effect from year 2006 and even a Cabinet Memorandum was submitted twice under the signature of the Minister Karu Jayasuriya and thereafter Ranjith Maddumabandara who, in turn, were entrusted with the subject of Public Administration. However, now it transpires that due to strong objections and counter-recommendations of the same category of high ranking officers who initially downgraded this Service in year 2006, the Ministry of Public Administration has submitted a Note to the Cabinet proposing to further downgrade recruitment level of Graduate Translators in 11 salary steps while even not restoring the Executive level its Special Class lost in year 2006.
Against this backdrop, we urge the Minister of Official Languages who seems to be genuinely interested in bringing about national reconciliation, to celebrate International Translation Day on September 30 with a strong determination to fight for the rights of Translators in the Cabinet and celebrate the same Day next year at least by restoring the status Translators enjoyed upto year 2006. We trust you and are positive that soon you will usher in the spring season for Government Translators and thereby for the movement of national reconciliation, not by offering any extra privilege, but only by restoring the status Translators enjoyed upto year 2006 and then were made deprived of. Then, and only then, will the nation be able to meaningfully celebrate the International Translation Day in year 2018 as a member state of the UNO.

Snap elections in Japan
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe dissolved the lower house of Parliament last Monday and called a snap election on October 22, one year ahead of schedule. At present his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leads a coalition government.
He is taking advantage of a surge in his popularity that reached 50 percent, following his strong reaction to the North Korean missile crisis. Also the opposition is relatively weak at the moment.
However, a new party Party of Hope  led by Tokyos former female Governor Yuriko Koike has emerged in the horizon and is gaining support. Several Opposition Democratic Party (DP) Parliamentarians have already joined the new party. There are also moves to amalgamate the DP with the new party. The Party of Hope proposes that Japan should be nuclear free, which is popular among the population. It also opposes a proposed tax hike. Both these positions give it an advantage over the LDP.
A survey by the Mainichi newspaper showed 18 percent of voters plan to vote for Koike's Party of Hope compared to 29 percent for Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
An Asahi newspaper poll showed 13 percent planned to vote for Koike's party versus 32 percent for the LDP.
The world as it isIn the real world, the wealth owned by eight men altogether is equivalent to the wealth shared by 3.6 billion human beings, who make up the poorest half of humanity.
In terms of turnover, 69 of the 100 biggest entities of the world are transnationals, not States. The turnover of the world's ten biggest corporations is higher than the public revenues earned by 180 countries combined.
Seven hundred million persons live in extreme poverty; 21 million are victims of forced labour. In 2015, 5.9 million children died of preventable or curable diseases before reaching the age of 5. A total of 758 million adults are illiterate.
Eight hundred and fifteen million persons suffer from chronic hunger -tens of millions more than in 2015. Two billion are undernourished. Even if the precarious decreasing growth rate of recent years rebounds, 653 million persons will continue to face hunger by the year 2030, and this will not be enough to eradicate hunger by the year 2050.
It would be practically impossible to reach Sustainable Development goals by 2030.
There are 22.5 million refugees. Humanitarian tragedies associated to migrants flows worsen and increase amidst a clearly unjust international economic and political order.
The construction of walls and barriers as well as the laws and measures adopted to prevent the waves of refugees and migrants have proved to be cruel and ineffective. There is a proliferation of exclusive and xenophobic policies that violate the human rights of millions of persons and fail to solve the problems of underdevelopment, poverty and armed conflicts, which are the main causes of migration and refugee claims.
Military expenditures have increased to 1.7 trillion dollars. That reality belies those who claim that there are not enough resources to eradicate poverty.
UN to blacklist firms operating in occupied Palestine
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Chief Zeid Raad al-Hussein has notified about 150 Israeli and international companies that they will be blacklisted for operating in Israeli occupied territories, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem al-Quds and Golan Heights. Over half of the companies were Israeli, nearly 30 were American and the rest were mainly from Germany, Norway and South Korea.
The companies include giant international corporations such as Coca-Cola, TripAdvisor, Airbnb and Caterpillar as well as major Israeli firms, including pharmaceutical giant Teva, the national phone company Bezeq, bus company Egged, the national water company Mekorot and the regimes two largest banks, Hapoalim and Leumi.
Several of them have assured Hussein that they do not plan to renew their current contracts or to enter into new ones.
United Nations is compiling a list of companies that operate in these lands in violation of international law and UN resolutions.
Worlds biggest Free Trade Zone
Complex negotiations are proceeding on the establishment of creating the worlds largest Free Trade Zone. Named the Integral Regional Economic Association (IREA) will include the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN): Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam as well as China, South Korea, Australia, India, Japan and New Zealand.
When finalized the 16-nation IREA will comprise half the worlds population and almost one third of the global Gross Domestic Product.
According to the most recent statistics of the World Bank, the economy of the United States is the biggest in the world with a value of 18 trillion dollars, almost one fourth of the world total (24.3 percent). After the U.S. are China (11 trillion dollars, 14.8 percent) and Japan (4. 4 trillion dollars, almost six percent).
Next places are Germany (3.3 trillion dollars); the United Kingdom (2.9) and France (2.4). India (two trillion dollars), Italy (1.8), Brazil (almost 1.8) and Canada (1.5) follow next.
China is not going to be second forever. In 2016, Chinese GDP expanded 6.7 percent, while that of the U.S. only grew by 1.6 percent. So it will surpass that of the US sooner or later.
The IREA is designed to cover trade of goods and services, investment, economic and technical cooperation, intellectual property rights, competition policy and the solving of disputes, among others. The megaproject will eliminate about 80 percent of the tariff barriers, that is, eight to nine thousand types of taxes.

Sri Lankas elderly population  to reach 3.6 million by 2021
Sri Lanka has a rapidly aging population from the Asian region which is a serious challenge in many aspects. In 2012, the population over 60 years was 2.5 million which was 12.5 percent of the total population, Consultant Physician Dr. Lasantha Ganewatta told the Daily News, yesterday.
The population would increase to about 3.6 million by 2021, which is 16.7 percent of the total population according to demographic statistics. By 2041, one out of four of the population would be elderly. Therefore, this will affect greatly on the countrys economy, she said. Dr. Ganewatta said it is our moral responsibility to look after our parents. Apart from that, as doctors, it is our obligation to find a way of keeping senior citizens healthy for their betterment as well as the country. Elders Day could be considered as an eye-opener to address these issues and to discuss health matters to live healthy in old age, she said.
Geriatric medicine or elderly medicine refers to the health of people above 60 years. It is different to other branches of medicine and needs specialized doctors and paramedical personnel as well as appropriately equipped units, she said. Even though we have a relatively large population of the elderly in South Asian countries, we do not have a single specialized geriatric unit with qualified and trained staff to address their health-related problems, she added.

Toddler steals Prince Harrys popcorn
CANADA: Prince Htarry made a new friend at the Invictus Games. Unfortunately for him, it appeared she was only after one thing: his popcorn.
Emily Henson, two, made a bold grab for the Princes snack as he was absorbed in conversation on Thursday night.
The daring raid saw her get away with poaching popcorn for nearly a minute, before the Prince realised what was going on.
When he spotted Emily, daughter of his friend and former Invictus competitor and Paralympian David Henson, he teased her by taking the bag of popcorn away before relenting.
Playful Prince Harry went on to entertain the toddler, feeding her pieces of popcorn and admiring her toy.
Pulling an extraordinary range of faces to make her laugh, he poked his tongue out and pretended to grimace as he pointed out the cameras ahead of them.
Needing no more encouragement, Emily responded in kind by sticking her bottom lip out before settling in to lean on his knee and watch the volleyball action.
Prince Harry, 33, was seated with the Henson family in the stands for the UK v Denmark match at the Invictus Games in Toronto.
Henson, a former royal engineer who attended the volleyball with toddler Emily and his wife Hayley, had both his legs blown off by an IED in Afghanistan in 2011.
Earlier this year, Prince Harry told The Telegraph: Of course, Id love to have kids.
Already uncle to Prince George and Princess Charlotte, he will welcome a third niece or nephew next year after Kensington Palace announced the Duchess of Cambridge is pregnant again.
