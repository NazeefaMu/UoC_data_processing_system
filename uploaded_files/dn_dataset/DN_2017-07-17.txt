Jungle hideaway
From the outside, this suburban house looks completely normal.
But venture to the back garden and youll discover a hidden feature so impressive that it actually attracts paying visitors.
Nick Wilson, 61, has spent 15,000 over the last 20 years to transform the back garden of his detached house into an incredible hidden rain forest.
The green-fingered jungle fanatic was inspired to transform his garden in Leeds after falling in love with big plants during family holidays to Cornwall in the 1990s.
He started the jungle make-over in 1998 and opened the hidden paradise to visitors six years ago.
Speaking about his impressive project, Nick said: It took 20 years to put it all together. There are so many big ferns, bamboos and big leaf plants down there.
I had no idea that I liked big, thick enormous plants so much. It was just such a difference to soft, fluffy garden plants. Its definitely a blokes garden.
My inspiration came from family holidays to Cornwall in the 1990s and suddenly my back garden was overflowing with massive plants.
The jungle plant that kicked off Nicks project was a Gunnera Mannicata, also known as a Chilean rhubarb, which can grow to four metres tall with three metres wide leaves.Nick said: I bought it in a garden centre in Cornwall and put a seat belt around it in the back of the car to get it back home.
Thats the thing - the plants in here arent actually that rare. You should be able to pick them up at any garden centre in the UK.
The key plants in this jungle are Tetrapanax Rex, Gunnera Mannicata and the Tree Fern.
Nick, a father and grandfather-of-one, has opened up his garden for viewings and donates the proceeds to different charities.
The Garden Jungle has already hosted one open day this year on June 25 in partnership with Roundhay Open Gardens which attracted around 500 visitors and raised 2,500 pounds for St Gemmas Hospice at Moortown.
Nick is teaming up with the National Garden Scheme to open his jungle paradise to visitors again on July 30. The money raised will go towards the Marie Curie and MacMillan cancer charities.
Despite the amount spent over the years, the upkeep of the Jungle Garden is not as much as you would expect.
Nick said: Now that everything is set up, the main cost is yearly maintenance but Id say that only comes to about 200.
Ive got a lot of wooden walkways and fixtures, so obviously they need cleaning and maintaining, usually with a pressure washer.
In order to create the jungle effect I use normal English bedding like geraniums and New Guinea hybrids. I buy a lot of those types of plants every year.
Over winter a lot of the plants can be protected from the cold by wrapping their leavers back around the stems. I bring the rest indoors and take them back out around May.
Its not just outside visitors that enjoy his jungle paradise but his grandson loves to play in grandads special back garden as well.
Nick said: My grandson loves it. Weve put in loads of plastic spiders and other animals that he absolutely loves. Its a really nice place for him to run around and play.
He added: My wife is very supportive of my creation as well. She calls it a blokes garden and just leaves me to it really.

Kudos from Rajitha to media
Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne yesterday offered a special bouquet to all media institutions for rallying around his Ministrys call and helping in the dengue eradication programme launched by the Ministry.
He said all media institutions set aside commercial gain and devoted their programmes to educate the people and rally support for the dengue eradication programme and he wished to thank them profusely for lending this assistance towards this worthy cause.
Minister Dr. Senaratne expressed these sentiments participating in a dengue eradication drive in China Fort Beruwala to inaugurate the programme in the Kalutara district.
The Health Minister said although Non-Communicable Diseases was a major threat the immediate challenge facing his Ministry was the burgeoning dengue epidemic. Although the number of dengue patients had increased the ministry had been able to restrict the dengue deaths at 0.3 percent this spoke well for the efficient health care and treatment service maintained by the ministry. He said so far the number of patients reported stood at around 90,000.
A visiting WHO team which studied the situation in the country had submitted an action plan to reduce the number of patients by 50 percent within four weeks.
The Who had also pledged financial support the this action plan and it was this action plan the Ministry implemented presently.
After the inaugural ceremony the Tri-Forces and Police personnel fined health workers on house inspections to detect and destroy mosquito breeding places and educate the people.
Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya, Provincial Councillors Prassana Sanjeewa and Isthikar Jameel, Director General of Health Services Dr. Jayasundara Bandara and other officials were also present on the occasion.

Lankas external payments  position fragile -  Moodys
Moodys Investors Service says that the Government of Sri Lankas B1 rating is supported by the economys robust medium-term GDP growth prospects, relatively large economy, and high income levels when compared with similarly rated sovereigns.
At the same time, despite recent progress in fiscal consolidation, credit challenges include high general government debt, very low debt affordability and large borrowing requirements. Moreover, Sri Lankas external payments position also remains fragile.
Moodys conclusions are contained in its just-released annual credit analysis, Government of Sri Lanka -- B1 Negative.
This report elaborates on Sri Lankas credit profile in terms of Economic Strength, Moderate (+); Institutional Strength, Low (+); Fiscal Strength, Very Low (-); and Susceptibility to Event Risk, Moderate.
These are the four main analytic factors in Moodys Sovereign Bond Rating Methodology.
In 2017, Moodys expects real GDP growth of 4.6%, which reflects the temporary negative impact of adverse weather-related events during the first half of the year.
Meanwhile, Moodys expects GDP growth to average 5.2% per year in 2017-21, a robust growth rate.
Sri Lanka has progressed with some reforms under its three-year International Monetary Fund (IMF) Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program.
In particular, revenue measures aimed at increasing taxes, such as last years value-added tax (VAT) rate hike and this years pending new Inland Revenue Reform act, have the potential to sustainably increase government revenues.
Sri Lankas low tax efficiency and tax collection provide significant scope to broaden the tax base and increase the tax revenue/GDP ratio, which was only 12.4% in 2016 said William Foster, a Vice President and Senior Credit Officer at Moodys.
Total government revenues are also very low, with a general government revenue/GDP ratio of 14.3% in 2016, one of the lowest among B-rated sovereigns.
Despite ongoing fiscal consolidation, Sri Lankas credit profile will remain constrained by its large debt burden and very low debt affordability, combined with contingent liability risks from state-owned enterprises.
Moodys expects general government debt to decline only gradually to around 78% of GDP in 2018, from 79.3% in 2016, significantly higher than the median of 53% for B-rated sovereigns.

Lanka prepared to chase any target  head coach Pothas
Interim head coach Nic Pothas is confident that whatever target that Zimbabwe leaves Sri Lanka with, they will go out and chase.
Theres 12 more overs with the old ball, and then we get a new ball again. Well have to have a chat tonight and see what kind of plan we come up with for tomorrow morning, said Pothas at the end of the third day.
Im always a firm believer that what we see on TV is not reality. Unless I get to speak to the boys that are physically out there, well get a better picture. One step at a time, we need to take four wickets, and once we do that, whatevers set we need to go out and chase. Theres plenty of time left in the game, he said.
Pothas said that he was surprised the way Zimbabwe had fought back in the Test.
They have a quality support staff. They are battlers and fighters. I played against Zimbabwe a long time ago in South Africa. Theyre always going to fight and put up a good show. So its not surprising.
On the condition of the pitch Pothas said that it had changed quite a bit and in the subcontinent you have to accept that.
Once the hardness went out of the ball today, it didnt seem like it did as much as yesterday. Yesterday and day one it spun. But at the end of the day were playing in the subcontinent and wickets spin, said Pothas.
You just need to come up with plans to score, and how youre going to get wickets. It hasnt been anything to write home about. Today it was surprising that it didnt do as much as expected, but we just need to find a way of getting wickets.
Pothas gave credit to both teams the way they tackled the third day pitch.
Youve got to give credit to our players as well as the opposition. Once the hardness went out of the ball, it obviously became a bit more difficult. I thought Raza played really well, as did Moor and Waller. But our guys were phenomenal. They did their jobs, said Pothas. I thought the quality of the fielding was superb. They stuck to their job. It hasnt been easy. But well get up again tomorrow morning, try to get a few quick wickets, and then chase a score.
Pothas who is in his first series as head coach wanted everyone to be patient with the present team.
You need to differentiate between talent and performance. There is an amazing amount of skill in this group. We need to be patient with them, Pothas said. Theyre putting in some good performances. At the moment, were certainly not as consistent as wed like. But give it some time, and youll have a phenomenal cricket team.
A really good fighting chance to win  Waller
Zimbabwe all-rounder Malcolm Waller said that his team was in with a good fighting chance to win the one-off Test against Sri Lanka at the end of the third day.
The guys are extremely positive after the One Day series. It was great and it helped all of us mentally. Weve got a great chance here, said Waller who is unbeaten on 57 out of an unfinished stand of 107 with Sikander Raza.
We can go out there tomorrow and put on another 100 runs and possibly you never know whats going to happen. It will give us a really good fighting chance.
Obviously when you are coming out in the second innings, its always going to be very tough. We had a small lead but its positive. It was really a shaky start and it put us under a lot of pressure in the changing room.
It was a great partnership between Raza and PJ Moor. I think that stabilized the things and brought back the positivity. At the end of the day, we can be happy with what we have achieved, he said.
Waller said the couple of weeks they have spent in Sri Lanka has allowed the team to start gelling really well.
Guys are getting good ideas from Allan James, and definitely, lot more positive in the camp. Guys are in good fighting sprits and everyone is getting on well. Everyone is helping each other and pushing on.
Waller said the mood in the dressing room at lunch was very quite with Zimbabwe on 23-4. It wasnt the ideal start as we lost wickets quickly. But the batters had to remain and we sat down and thought if we guard and fight, be positive and show that you mean business and roll over for nothing. Show what you got and the guys got it in that way.
Batting after lunch wasnt really easy. We saw the odd one do turn. Youre always going to get the odd one that turns and jumps. We focused concentrating on every ball and its never easy out there. Especially, in the second innings in Sri Lanka, the pressure is always on. You just got to keep batting the way you know and back your plans.

Manodara helps Sri Lanka beat Pakistan for first win
Dilani Manodara hit her highest ODI score on the way to helping Sri Lanka end its ICC Womens World Cup 2017 campaign on a high with an entertaining 15-run victory over Pakistan at Grace Road, Leicester.
Without a victory between them all competition, both teams went into the game unable to progress to the semi-finals but there was still pride at stake and it proved to be a thriller.
Manodara recorded her second ODI half-century of the competition, top-scoring for her team with 84, as Sri Lanka posted 221 for seven from its 50 overs.
Despite Syeda Nain Fatima Abidis entertaining 57, Pakistan faltered in the middle overs and came up short as Sri Lankas Chandima Gunaratne finished with four for 41. Sri Lanka captain Inoka Ranaweera said: This is the first victory for us at the competition, we are very happy to beat Pakistan today. We made a plan yesterday, we stuck to it and we won the match because of that.
We want to thank the ICC and everyone who has made our stay in England so enjoyable.
Electing to bat first, Sri Lanka was dealt a blow when Nipuni Hansika (one) was bowled by Diana Baig before Hasini Perera (13) was caught behind by Sidra Nawaz, again off Diana, with the score 18 for two.
Chamari Atapattu  Sri Lankas top scorer at this tournament with 311 runs  survived a close lbw call on nine before crashing a number of boundaries through the covers as she and Shashikala Siriwardena put on 46, before the former found Sana Mir at midwicket.
And while Sri Lanka lost Siriwardena (17) and Prasadani Weerakkody (five) for 16 runs, Manodara and Eshani Lokusooriya came together to wrestle some much-needed momentum back, bringing up the 50-run partnership in 70 balls.
Manodara registered her third career ODI half-century with a quick single in the 40th over but Lokusooriya was impressively caught by Sana at mid-wicket two overs later.
Sensing a first ODI century, Manodara accelerated the pace but her 111-ball innings was ended on 84 when she edged to Sidra off Diana and Sri Lanka batted out its overs.
In reply, Pakistans Bibi Nahida (10) was bowled by Gunaratne in the sixth over, while fellow opener Ayesha Zafar could only manage eight off 30 balls before being caught at short cover by Atapattu.
Javeria Wadood plundered five fours in a lively 24 off 35 balls before being run out by Siriwardena before Syeda and Iram Javed gave Pakistan hope by putting on 50 runs in 56 balls.
Syeda brought up her ninth ODI half-century after a Sri Lanka misfield before the partnership was ended when Iram (15) holed out to Ama Kanchana in the 26th over.
Its momentum was further checked when Syeda and Sana exited within two overs of each other  the formers wicket celebrated greatly by Sri Lanka  before Kainat Imtiaz (11) and Sidra Nawaz (5) both departed cheaply.
With Asmavia Iqbal and Diana at the crease, Pakistan was determined to fight until the end with some powerful hitting leaving them in with a chance.
But Diana was then superbly caught by Athapaththu in the covers and the match concluded when Sadia Yousaf was bowled by Ranaweera with 20 balls remaining.
Pakistan captain Mir said: Our batters have been under pressure throughout the tournament but they put up a fight today.
Mostly we are not able to finish matches when we get on top as we give away wickets at crucial times and that happened again today.
We are very disappointed. But in life, these things happen but you have to bounce back.
We will learn from their tournament and the younger players will come back stronger.

Moratuwa University denies hand in inhumane killing of dogs: Blames private contractor

Vice Chancellor of the University of Moratuwa Prof. A.K.W. Jayewardene has denied a role in the inhumane killing of dogs and cats at the premises, and instead, blamed a private contractor.
We hired a private contractor to chase away stray dogs and cats but we never asked them to drug and kill the animals, he told Daily News Online.
It was their decision to sedate, remove and dump the stray dogs and cats, Vice Chancellor Jayewardene said.
He said the issue had occurred after one or two dogs had been overdosed on the tranquilizer Ketamine but added that he had instructed officials not to use such methods hereafter.
Animal rights activists were up in arms over the video and image evidence circulating the Internet of the inhumane killing of dogs and cats at the university premises.
Moratuwa University Vice Chancellor Prof. A.K.W. Jayewardene however said the images were false and that he called a meeting with activists to clear the universities involvement.
He also denied the charge he had brought pressure on the university students who were circulating the images and video evidence, to remove them off social media.
The incident comes hot on the heels of community dogs at the Sri Jayawardenepura University being rounded up and dumped elsewhere.
Efforts to locate the dogs have proved futile. Activists are holding Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha responsible for what they term mass killings of dogs and cats.

More women in politics
Newspapers reported yesterday that the Government has drafted an amendment to the Provincial Councils Elections Act of 1988 to make it mandatory for 30 percent of the total number of candidates included in a nomination paper to be female.
The amendment apparently empowers the Elections Commission to reject any nomination paper which does not contain the number of female candidates required to be nominated. The Local Authorities Act was amended in 2016 to make provision for 30 percent of those included in nominations lists to be female candidates for Local Government elections.
This is great news, since both Provincial Council and Local Government elections will now include at least 30 percent women in the nominations process. Granted, there is no guarantee that they will all enter the respective political institution, but this gives voters a pool to choose from and at least some of them will make it through.
For a country that produced the worlds first woman Prime Minister (Sirimavo Bandaranaike), our track record in terms of women in politics is abysmally poor.
The present Parliament has only a handful of women MPs and Ministers, which is pathetically low for a flourishing democracy that has had universal franchise long before gaining independence in 1948. There are only a few women representatives at provincial councils and local bodies. This is not a healthy state of affairs at all, because the voice of women really matters.
At the grassroots level, it is women who know social and development needs. Women have an intimate knowledge of all development and social shortcomings faced by the village community. This is why it is important to give them a voice  and the power  right from the grassroots level to implement these projects.
There is another disconcerting factor  most, if not all, of the women in politics now have more or less inherited politics from their fathers, uncles or brothers. It is extremely rare for a women candidate with no such connections to emerge. This anomaly should be actively addressed by political parties.
They should search for women who are already active in grassroots NGOs, various professional societies and community organisations. These are ideal platforms for launching a long political career, because they possess a fairly good idea of the needs of their areas.
Lankan women are politically savvy. They in fact form the majority of the voting population. Go to any polling booth on an election day and see which line is longer  the females queue, invariably. This shows how keen women are to exercise their franchise. They have a very good knowledge of political news and trends. Their opinions are valuable and their verdicts are often spot on. As to why this is not translated into greater political representation for women is a mystery.
But one factor becomes clear: women are not voting for women in sufficient numbers. This is a shame, because the demand for more women in Parliament and other political bodies should emanate from women themselves. If women also overwhelmingly vote for male candidates, there will be little place for women in politics. Women candidates too should make an extra effort to reach out to women constituents.
There are a number of other issues that discourage more women from entering the fray. In Sri Lanka, it is difficult to enter the political field if you do not have the right connections which often means a family background in politics. An effort should be made to defy this trend.
Another impediment for prospective women candidates is funding, or rather the lack of it. Candidates need a lot of money to contest an election, especially under the PR system. We hope that the upcoming elections will be held under the proposed new electoral system that creates a more level playing field. Propaganda material and meetings cost millions of rupees. There should be a mechanism where the political parties subsidise a part of the campaign for novice women politicians.
The violence associated with the electioneering process is another potent factor that drives women, especially new entrants, away from the political stage. They are completely alien to this environment and do not want to get entangled in clashes with other (mostly male) candidates.
However, there is a chance that the level of violence would be greatly diminished once the new electoral system is introduced. Women already in politics must help identify prospective political aspirants in their electorates and pave the way for them to come forward. This will help dispel any fears and doubts that may be initially entertained by the new candidates.
The media too have a major role to play. They should highlight the success stories of women who have taken to politics here and abroad, including those without any family connections to politics. This will help plant the seeds of a political career in the minds of many more women and at least some of them are likely to turn their thoughts into concrete action. That is exactly what we need now to enliven and enrich a political landscape mostly devoid of female representation.

Moulding the Senagama pottery industry
Dilrukshi, a 33-year-old residing in Senagama, Uhanadivision, one of the most remote villages in theAmpara District, is athird generation pottery crafter. She is a member of a dynamic community whichhas been engaged in the pottery-making industry for over 15 years.
Pottery is very strenuous and yet also rewarding- making something beautiful out of basically nothing. Dilrukshi, together with support from her husband, spend hours and hours wedging and kneading the clay and thereafter heating it to the specific requirements.
Placing it on the potters wheel, she then goes on to mould beautiful pots in all shapes and sizes. The making of this in itself is pure art.
She starts at the bottom, place one hand on each side and pulls the clay up, gently shaping it with her fingers.
Unfortunately, this is a dying industry in Senagama.
With dwindling resources and costly infrastructure, Dilrukshi and her family are barely staying afloat. It was still her dream to expand her business so she can take care of her children and the family trade.
The United Nation Development Programme (UNDP),under the European Union funded Support to District Development Programme, in collaboration with the Government of Sri Lanka, stepped in to support her.
With an initial support to establish a clay-processing centre, UNDP then together with the National Design Centre provided technical development trainingon sustainable methodologies to increase production, quality control, product diversification and new designs.
This was coupled with the provision of an electric clay processer and electric potter wheels, which enable them to produce more within a short period.
Speaking on the GLED programme, Dilrukshi stated that if not for the programme the Senagama pottery industry would have run into rough waters.
We are now breathing a sigh of relief, as the GLED programme not only equipped us with the right technology, but educated us on business fundamentals and business planning, she said.
In an attempt to sustain this local production, UNDP then facilitated the establishment of the Senagama Clay Producers Society (SCPS). With a current membership of 16, this
Society will act as a single unit to support the business functions of the potters and also enhance the life standards of the member base.
With the support of UNDP Sri Lankas GLED programme, we are able to reach out to more sophisticated and bigger markets, she added.

Muguruza hopes Wimbledon glory won't backfire
LONDON, Saturday  Garbine Muguruza hopes the legacy of her first Wimbledon title will not be a depressing repeat of the torment she suffered after her 2016 French Open breakthrough.
The 23-year-old Spaniard stunned sentimental favourite Venus Williams 7-5, 6-0 on Saturday to clinch her second Grand Slam crown.
She immediately turned her thoughts to the future, hoping her triumph will be a launchpad for more majors rather than a one-way ticket into the abyss.
When she defeated Serena Williams to win Roland Garros last year, it was revenge for her loss to the American in the Wimbledon final 12 months earlier.
But instead of having the world at her feet, the burden of being a Grand Slam champion was too much.
She lost in the second round at Wimbledon last year to world number 124 Jana Cepelkova and crashed out at the same stage of the US Open to Anastasija Sevastova, ranked 48 at the time.
Muguruza made the quarter-finals of the Australian Open this year, but her Roland Garros title defence ended at the last-16 stage in tears and a bitter outburst at the Paris crowd.
It's not easy. It's very good when you win it, and it's hard after when you come back and you know you have to defend, said Muguruza.
But that's a good problem to have. It was tough obviously, because you know you have a lot of matches to go.
I'm happy to be in this situation. I'm happy that once again I see myself winning a Grand Slam, something that is so hard to do. It means a lot.
Muguruza's title triumph on Saturday was her first of any kind since the 2016 French Open.
Two of her four career titles have now come at the majors.
When Muguruza lost in the first round at the Eastbourne grass-court event on the eve of Wimbledon, it looked like she was suffering another Paris hangover.
But with memories of her post-Roland Garros problems still fresh, she said she was determined to put the record straight.
She proved as good as her word, knocking out top seed Angelique Kerber, from a set down, and seventh-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova on her way to the final.
Eastbourne was such a short tournament, I didn't play well there. But I did the week before in Birmingham (where she made the semi-finals), so that helped me, she said.
I always come very motivated to the Grand Slams. Since I lost the final here I wanted to change that.
I came thinking, I'm prepared, I feel good. During the tournament and the matches, I was feeling better and better. Every match, I was increasing my level. She said a glance at the honours board at the All England Club also spurred her on to end Venus's dreams of becoming the oldest Grand Slam women's champion.
I always look at the wall and see all the names and all the history. I lost that final. I'm like, I was close. I didn't wanted to lose this time, because I know the difference, she said.
On Saturday, Muguruza saved two set points at 4-5 in the opening set and swept the remaining nine games to take the title.  AFP

## Title: Outlaw enforced disappearances

Outlaw enforced disappearances
Our country has a shameful past around enforced disappearances. Minister Samarasinghe in 2012 at the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) at the United Nations referred to over 4,000 unresolved cases from the pre-1990 period with another 1089 from the 1991-2005 period. The Presidential Commission to Investigate Complaints regarding Missing Persons (hereinafter known as the Paranagama Commission) was established by the former President of Sri Lanka, Mahinda Rajapaksa, on August 15, 2013 and by June 2015, the Commission had received more than 21,000 complaints.
Several Commissions of Inquiry have drawn their own conclusions. The Coi into disappearances (All Island) had ten thousand one hundred and thirty-six complaints handed over to the Commission from the three zonal Commissions.
Suspicious death
Six thousand three hundred and forty-five were fixed for inquiry. Of those, four thousand four hundred and seventy-three were inquired into by the Commission. Of the six hundred and fifty-four complaints pertaining to returned detainees, the Commission inquired into three hundred and eighty-four of them.
If there is a suspicious death  such as a death of someone in the custody of the police  the law requires magistrates to conduct an inquiry and record all relevant evidence before the body is given for interment. In the case of a suspicious death, a magistrate would usually order an autopsy to be conducted. However, in the case of enforced disappearances, this most fundamental legal requirement is ignored. Where emergency regulations are drafted in a manner that allows for enforced disappearances, provisions are made to empower a police officer of some rank to make orders to dispose of bodies. Where no such emergency regulations are operative, those who engage in enforced disappearances give themselves the right to dispose of the body.
Taken together we have a troubled past.
The proposed act as law
* What is an enforced disappearance
In order to be an enforced disappearance, BOTH of the following elements must be present:
-there must be a deprivation of liberty as set out in part (a) (It should be noted that this not apply to missing persons per se but only to those who are disappeared or subject to deprivation of liberty); AND -there must be a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty OR a concealing of the person OR a failure to disclose the whereabouts of the disappeared person. Section 3 of the proposed Act provides for the liability of NON-STATE actors, as well as superior officers who have direct control; willfully / consciously disregard information that their subordinated are engaging in enforced disappearances, or fail to take legitimate action to prevent same.
* Will this Act prevent the arrest of terrorism or other suspects, due to the way in which deprivation of liberty is defined
A fear has been expressed that the Act will hinder investigations.
Deprivation of liberty means the confinement of a person to a particular place, where such person does not consent to that confinement;
The deprivation of liberty is not criminalised or prevented by the Act. Seen in explanation of section 3, the offence is only established if there is a deprivation of liberty, coupled with a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or a concealing of the person or a failure to disclose the whereabouts of the disappeared person.
Law enforcement authorities are entitled to arrest (in accordance with the law). This does not mean that arrested persons can be held in secret detention because that would leave room for abuse, torture, extra-judicial killings etc. The Act will not hinder investigations.
Will this Act result in the prosecution of armed forces or police personnel, for alleged offences committed during the Armed Conflict
The Act does not have the retrospective operation, and will only apply to allegations of enforced disappearances committed after the Act comes into force. The Act is to prevent enforced disappearances in the future.
* Will the Bill result in International Prosecutions
It is open to any country to prosecute for offences if their law provides for same. This would be so regardless of this act.
However, by providing the legal mechanism for a domestic prosecution, it would be possible for Sri Lanka to argue that it is competent to prosecute in respect of domestic violations and that there should be no international prosecutions (in an international tribunal) in respect of same. It is an accepted principle in international law that international fora will not assume jurisdiction if a crime can be effectively prosecuted in domestic fora. Section 6 specifically provides that the High Court of Sri Lanka shall have exclusive jurisdiction to try offences under the Act. Therefore, by enacting the law, Sri Lanka will be taking responsibility for the investigation and prosecution of alleged Enforced Disappearances committed within Sri Lanka, and thus be able to argue that the matter should not be prosecuted before International Fora.
* What are the rights of a victim
- To know the truth regarding the circumstances of enforced disappearances
- To know the progress and results of the investigations relating to enforced disappearances
- To know the fate of the disappeared persons
[section 14]
* Why arent the provisions in the Penal Code sufficient
The Penal Code deals with unlawful restraint and confinement. However, the scope of the proposed law is different. It deals with situations where the initial arrest may (or may not) be lawful and goes onto requiring that the arrested persons not be held in secret detention, that his location not be concealed etc. Thus the scope of the offence of Enforced Disappearance and unlawful restraint/confinement is different.
Rather than confining itself to creating a new offence, the objective of the Act is to create a culture in which Enforced Disappearances do not occur. The objective of the Bill is to ensure that Enforced Disappearances do not occur. While there can be lawful arrests, persons must be held in lawful detention centres, and their arrest documented. This will prevent torture, abuse and extra judicial killings.

Pakistan launches offensive against IS near Afghan border

Pakistan's military says it has launched a major operation against so-called Islamic State (IS) in the north-western region along the Afghan border.
A spokesman said militants had gained ground inside Afghanistan and had to be stopped from extending their influence.
He said the "Khyber 4" operation, backed by the air force, would focus on the mountainous Rajgal Valley area in Khyber Agency.
Pakistan has previously denied the presence of IS on its territory.
However, the growth of the group - often referred to as Daesh - in neighbouring Afghanistan has alarmed Islamabad and the group has claimed several attacks in Pakistan over the past two years.
"This operation was necessary because Daesh is getting established there and we have to stop the influence spreading into Pakistani territory through the Rajgal Valley," military spokesman Lt Gen Asif Ghafoor said.
IS in the region is mostly made up of former members of the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban and Gen Ghafoor reiterated the government's stance that the group has no established presence inside Pakistan.
"There is no organised infrastructure and we shall not allow them to establish themselves," he said.
"As regards inside Afghanistan, yes, Daesh is getting stronger there, is gaining strength. But still, we feel that it is not purely the Daesh which is there in the Middle East."
He said that the operation would first secure the border near Rajgal Valley and forces would then clear the rest of the area. He said multiple "terrorist" organisations with links to recent attacks in Pakistan had safe havens on the other side of border.
The Rajgal Valley and Khyber Agency are part of the volatile Federally Administered Tribal Areas.
IS controls some territory in Afghanistan and has been seeking to strengthen its presence in Pakistan since 2015 when it carried out its first attack in the country.
At about that time, IS announced the establishment of its Khorasan branch - a historical name for Afghanistan and the surrounding areas. It marked the first time that IS had officially spread outside the Arab world.

Peoples Bank launches Swashakthi Loan Scheme
The launching of Swashakthi Loan Scheme and awarding of grants to startups was held under the patronage of Peoples Bank Chairman Hemasiri Fernando at the Nuwara Eliya branch recently.
Swashakthi Loan scheme is awarded by Peoples Bank in collaboration with the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs through its extensive branch network comprising over 735 branches islandwide.
In an exclusive interview with our newspaper, Peoples Bank Deputy General Manager (Enterprise Banking) K.B. Rajapakse shed light upon important aspects of Swashakthi Loan scheme.
Q: How do you define Swashakthi Loan Scheme
A: Swashakthi Loan Scheme can be defined as a grant and loan scheme implemented under governments intervention via the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs and the Peoples Bank to uplift mirco-financial and small-scale entrepreneurs. Under the purview of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, state banks and private banks have been given an opportunity to grant a maximum of Rs. 250,000 loan at a rate of 5.5% per annum to micro-financial and small-scale enterprises to launch new ventures and self-employed businesses.
This scheme mainly focuses on startups which can obtain a loan at the same rate with a grant of maximum Rs 50,000. Government has made substantial allocations to facilitate the loan scheme for both existing and new customers.
The loan scheme has drawn special attention on startup ventures, while aiming to create 25,000 new entrepreneurs as per the governments target of creating one million jobs.
Prior to implementing the loan scheme, Peoples Bank identify the existing customers through its branch network and new customers introduced through Divisional Secretariats, educate them on benefits of the scheme and finally register the beneficiaries.
Q: What is the key objective of this loan scheme
A: The main objective of the loan scheme is to offer financial assistance to empower and uplift existing micro-businesses and SMEs currently engaged in agriculture, livestock, industrial and service sectors.
The loan scheme also aims to support the youth to discover their hidden talents and skills, potentials, initiate new ventures, enter the buisness world and achieve commercial success.
Furthermore, the Swashakthi Loan Scheme facilitates an environment to support existing and prospective SMEs in rural areas to incorporate new technologies and entrepreneurial skills and grow their ventures.
Q: Apart from granting loans, can you explain the role played by the Peoples Bank
A: Peoples Bank not only grant loans, but also provides free consultancy services for the beneficiaries on successful business operation and financial management which includes how to maintain financial records. In addition, we educate them on facing market risks, managing and winning market competition.
Q: What kind of enterprises do you think are more likely to benefit from this loan scheme
A: We believe that enterprises such as those involved in plant nurseries, agricultural crops, handicrafts, organic fertilizer production, small-scale food outlets (with take away service) and small industry can greatly benefit from this loan scheme and successfully grow their ventures, as such enterprises have a higher demand in the market today.
We have already disbursed loans to a great number of beneficiaries under the Swashakthi Loan Scheme.
Loans are granted to those who have already registered under the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, or those who are contemplating for registration. Furthermore, the government makes a financial contribution of Rs. 50,000 for the new entrepreneurs who are eligible to receive a maximum of Rs. 200,000 grant under this loan scheme.
All in all, it is our prime objective to pave the way for these micro and small-scale entrepreneurs to gradually grow their business to subsequently become medium-scale and eventually large-scale entrepreneurs.

Peter Matthiessens Notebook
Before I became friends with Peter Matthiessen, I was his editor. We talked on the phone and our conversations, when Id reach him driving one of his numerous loops through the deep West, never started with where he was but rather where he was going. All the travel, all the reporting, were central to his work.
I like to hear and smell the countryside, the land my characters inhabit, he said, when he talked about writing. I dont want these characters to step off the page, I want them to step out of the landscape. And they did, I think, because his great discipline allowed him to write well from wherever he went, from however deep he got.
Sorted garbage
Peter traveled with universal notebooks, taking notes on the right-hand pages, leaving the left blank until he used them for his first run at usable copyusually in the evening after a day of reporting.
It was an efficient system that made him productive on the road. The notebooks were artifacts, too, and I think they meant as much to him as the research they held, although he insisted that this was a silly idea.
He lost one of those notebooks once, at the San Francisco airport, while returning from reporting in Klamath National Forest in Northern California.
Those were the days of pay phones, and Peter had left the notebook at one in the main terminalfor only a few minutes, but when he realized what he had done and quickly returned, it was gone. Hans Teensma, who was the art director at Outside, had driven Peter to the airport and was seeing him off.
They went on the search together. Then as now, there was no effective lost-and-found at any airport, so that took about five minutes before they started reverse engineering the trash-disposal procedure. They found rooms full of sorted garbage, but Peter, forlorn and increasingly resigned to the loss, had a flight to catch.
Brilliant and wonderful
Hans continued the search, with no luck. Driving home that night empty-handed, he figured that only a crazy person would look at one of Peters notebooks and not understand that someone had put a lot of work into it. They might not want to go to any trouble to find the owner, but something like that would be very difficult to just throw away. Hans returned to the airport the next afternoon and tracked down the notebook in the janitors changing room. One of them had picked it up and just stuck it on a shelf before he went home.
Hans called Peter, and then Peter called me to tell me what a brilliant and wonderful thing Hans had done. Hans and I worked together again at Rocky Mountain Magazine and then lost touch, but for all the years that followed Peter and I would talk about how Hans had gone back to the airport and found that notebook. Peter always implied some kind of tangential credit for me, the way he often did with his friends when something theyd had very little to do with went right in the world. It was a way for us to talk about the value of work and friendship. - Paris Review

PROTECTING ROGUES  THE PRESIDENT HAS SPOKEN
Even without modern forensic technology, the Sri Lanka Police successfully investigated celebrated criminal cases such as the Whitehouse murder case, the Ceylon Turn Club murder and robbery, the Adelene Vitharane Murder Case, the Kadugannawa Parcel Bomb Case etc., To investigators of the calibre of Albert Silva Makalanda, Iyer, Ambalavanar, Thavarajah, Sergeants Appuhamy and Sediris the crimes of the last regime would not have been challenges. However, it must also be conceded, the politicians of the time were truly honourabe
The entire nation has waited anxiously with bated breath and in hope for over two years to see at least one crook of the last regime prosecuted, convicted and punished. To bring those who had robbed the nation to justice was the main plank of the platform on which this government came to power giving the people the promise of good governance and better times. This remains a distant dream.
Law abiding citizens are bitter. They are angry. Day by day they are losing faith in their leaders. Even those who had been considered clean have sullied their hands and even their faces with layer upon layer of bonded faecal matter. The stench is unbearable. But with no alternative, not even a Macron on the horizon the peoples despair keeps on rising.
Celebrated criminal cases
Coming back to the subject, all were blaming the IGP, FCID, the NPC, the Bribery Commission and even the Minister for Law and Order. Even a potty passport forgery that could have been solved by a recruit PC or a peon of the Department of Immigration and Emigration has become a mighty challenge to our Scotland Yard trained investigators.
Even without modern forensic technology, the Sri Lanka Police successfully investigated celebrated criminal cases such as the Whitehouse murder case, the Ceylon Turn Club murder and robbery, the Adelene Vitharane Murder Case, the Kadugannawa Parcel Bomb Case etc., To investigators of the calibre of Albert Silva Makalanda, Iyer, Ambalavanar, Thavarajah, Sergeants Appuhamy and Sediris the crimes of the last regime would not have been challenges. However, it must also be conceded, the politicians of the time were truly honourabe. They did not commit crime, encourage crime or protect criminals.
Today even with all the unpleasant extraneous constraints, OICs of Police Stations, loaded with unproductive work such as providing security to tin pot political riff-raff successfully investigate, without the assistance of the AGs Dept, well planned bank and highway robberies and the activities of drug cartels.
These overworked, underpaid, least recognized, but infinitely more honourable than those officially carrying the prefix are indeed delivering. The country can be proud of these dedicated middle rank officers.
Ongoing investigations
Why then have these vital investigations gone awry At last the cat is out of the bag. The lead story of an English weekly on July 9 says it all: President Maithripala Sirisena has virtually declared a three month deadline for his coalition government to prosecute those responsible for high profile murders and corruption or risk losing its hold on power. President Sirisena told the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday that he was extremely uneasy about alleged backroom dealings of two key figures of former president Mahinda Rajapaksas administration.
The President has also stated that he was aware of those who have cut deals to either delay or scuttle some of the ongoing investigations; this is unacceptable.
The President has spoken. He must now translate his words to action. He has not only to deal with the rogues but also the rascals protecting the rogues. Its now or never. The people expect their President to do his duty.

Rain frustrates home side after Rudolph blast
LONDON, Saturday - Glamorgan were left frustrated by the rain after running up an impressive 171-5 in 17.2 overs against Somerset in their T20 Blast match played at Cardiff.
Captain Jacques Rudolph led the way with a beautifully-timed 65 not out off 37 balls, including six fours and two sixes.
He accelerated after the dismissal of Colin Ingram for 39 off 21 deliveries.
Th Spinner Roelof van der Merwe (0-29 in 4 overs) was Somerset's most economical bowler, while Aneurin Donald (24) and Chris Cooke (21) also chipped in quick runs for the Welsh county.
Both teams faced rapid turn-arounds for Sunday fixtures, with Glamorgan facing Essex at Chelmsford and Somerset taking on Middlesex at Uxbridge.
The match, which began 35 minutes late, was called off at 21:25 BST, giving Somerset their first point of 2017.

Raza stars in Zimbabwes splendid revival
The never give-up attitude that Zimbabwe displayed to win their maiden ODI series against Sri Lanka was quite evident at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday when they recovered from a shaky position of 23-4 at lunch to finish the third day of the one-off Test strongly placed at 252-6 to enjoy an overall lead of 262 with four second innings wickets intact.
From this position Zimbabwe could fancy their chances of pressing for their maiden Test win against Sri Lanka on a pitch which has afforded spin and bite when the ball is hard and comfortable to score runs when the ball is soft.
That Zimbabwe lost only a solitary wicket in each of the second and third sessions of play following the flurry of wickets that fell in the first session summarises the behavior of the pitch over the three days.
Whatever target that Zimbabwe sets it will not be an easy chase for Sri Lanka batting fourth on this pitch. It will be a tough challenge and will test the resources of the batting unit how well they can cope with the situation. In each of their matches on the tour where Zimbabwe has tasted success there has always been someone to put his hand up.
In the first ODI it was Solomon Mire who scored his maiden century, in the fourth ODI it was Craig Ervine, in the fifth ODI Hamilton Masakadza, the first innings of the current Test Craig Ervines monumental knock of 160 and yesterday Sikander Raza took the spotlight, although the match is not over yet.
Raza is just three runs away from scoring his maiden Test hundred but more importantly for Zimbabwe it was the time he spent at the wicket that was crucial. He has so far batted for 269 minutes and faced 158 balls in scoring 97 not out that has one six and eight fours.
Like Ervine in the first innings Zimbabwe found in Raza the cornerstone to build their second innings after Rangana Herath had left them high and dry at lunch by capturing three of the four wickets to fall for 23 runs.
Raza first forged a crucial 86-run stand with Peter Moor (40) and after his dismissal at 145, found another able partner in Malcolm Waller with whom he has added 107 runs in an unfinished seventh wicket partnership. that has really put Zimbabwe in control of the Test. Zimbabwe has nicely soaked up the pressure and continued building partnerships that has placed them in this strong position.
Waller completed his maiden Test half-century before the close to remain 57 not out off 76 balls (8 fours). Raza also could have got to his landmark before the end of the day but he was slowed down by fatigue and cramps having lasted out nearly two sessions. But the important fact for Zimbabwe is that he is still at the wicket.
Razas resolute batting coupled with moments of aggression has given the Zimbabwe bowlers a total to bowl at the opposition which in the morning session looked quite unlikely.
Sri Lankas last three wickets added 53 runs to be all out for 346 giving Zimbabwe a 10-run first innings lead. A hobbling Asela Gunaratne was the last man out for 45 having stayed at the crease for 126 minutes and helped his team add 108 valuable runs in partnerships with the late order and tail.

He commended the important role played by the RDB so farfor providing financial assistance to the less privileged population in the provinces and loans with concessionary interest rates to entrepreneurs at the village level.
The Minister also visited a few dairy farmers in the area funded by the RDB and a few microindustries. He also made a special visit to the Upuldeniya (in Mihinthale) warehouse complex constructed with aid from the World Bank under the guidance of the Ministry of Finance and managed by the RDB.
This warehouse complex could hold 5,000MT of grain when it is in full capacity. The minister commended the RDB for undertaking such projects especially in the areas where other financial institutions or banks have not gone into and where the rural masses and the farmers could get the maximum benefits and prices for their products.

The return of the repressed
The choppy waters of Brexit may not have been navigated before, but some of the flotsam bobbing around suggests stratagems and patterns that remind us  not encouragingly  of past crises in British political history. One aspect that has recently come into view concerns the relationship between British politicians and Ireland. William Ewart Gladstone referred to the neighbouring island in 1845 as that cloud in the west, that coming storm  a problem needing pacification.
Todays Republic of Ireland is not only pretty pacific, it has discovered (since 1973) a strongly European identity, which involves  as any Irish member of the Department of Foreign Affairs will tell you  an enhanced sense of sovereignty. British responses to European involvement, as usual, are diametrically different  peaking in the kind of British rhetoric that narrowly won last years referendum, and stridently took over Theresa Mays hapless government.
Historical memory
That rhetoric has accordingly paid little attention to European history, and the EUs importance in combating various toxins endemic to nationalism; it also has ignored, until very recently, the implications of Brexit for AngloIrish relations. This is to be expected. Historical memory works selectively, and it is easy to forget that for over a century from 1801, a hundred-odd Irish MPs were a large and integral part of the House of Commons; the novels of Anthony Trollope do a better job of reminding us than most history textbooks. But the Irish presence was not consistently felt, and their importance tended to come into sharp relief at moments of high drama, when they could hold the balance at Westminster.
The period of Daniel OConnells alliance with reforming Whig governments in the 1830s provided one such instance, as did  more spectacularly  the great crisis of 18856, when Gladstones government relied on Charles Stewart Parnells eighty-five nationalist MPs for its majority, precipitating the Grand Old Mans hasty conversion to Home Rule for Ireland.
The policy was unsuccessful, voted down in 1886 when the Liberals split over the issue and the Conservatives made the Union a central plank of their raison dtre; it was also powerfully opposed by Ulster Unionist MPs, who from this point formed a distinct and influential body of their own. Another attempt by Gladstone in 1893 passed the Commons but was thrown out by the Lords.
The subsequent period of Tory hegemony meant that the Irish MPs were relegated to impotence once more, until the Liberals return to power in 1906. Even then, the size of the Liberal majority restricted the extent to which the Irish leader John Redmond could keep the government up to the mark on delivering Home Rule, about which Gladstones successors were notably unenthusiastic. Once again, it took an indecisive election in 1910 to put the Irish MPs back in the front seat.
Threatened insurrection
This time, they exacted a considerable price; the Parliament Act of 1911 restricted the power of the House of Lords, and in 1914 a Home Rule bill was finally passed. But it was first delayed by Ulsters resistance, amounting to a threatened insurrection, then by the outbreak of the First World War, and finally by revolution in Ireland.
After the Easter Rising of 1916 politics went into meltdown and the running was made by republicans who saw Home Rule as an inadequate sop, and the Redmondites as corrupt collaborators. The post-war election of 1918 reduced the Home Rule MPs to six, returned twenty-six Irish Unionists (mostly from the north), and seventy-three Sinn Finers who  in line with their declared policy  did not take their seats at Westminster, withdrawing to Ireland and setting up an alternative revolutionary assembly, Dil Eireann.
At the height of the war that followed, in 1920, a Home Rule Act was finally passed, setting up governments in Belfast (for the six-county unit of Northern Ireland) and Dublin (for the remaining twenty-six counties); the provisions for southern Ireland were a dead letter from the start, replaced by the Irish Free State agreed by the AngloIrish Treaty of 1921.
Thus  to a collective English sigh of relief  Irish MPs disappeared from Westminster, except for thirteen (initially) representing Northern Irish constituencies. The handful of MPs returned by the nationalist community in the province attended episodically or abstained, following the old Sinn Fin mantra; the Unionists attended but kept a lower profile than in the dramatic days of the Home Rule campaigns.
Rather as Northern Ireland remained a sort of reduced and distilled version of the Irish Question of the nineteenth century, the Ulster MPs at Westminster represented a kind of prehensile tail of the behemoth that had once been the Irish presence at Westminster. The descent of their province into chaos from 1969 (and the suspension of their own assembly at Stormont) brought them episodically into an unwelcome prominence. So did those realpolitik moments when they had to be taken notice of  as James Callaghan found out in 1979, and the floundering Theresa May has been learning to her cost since June 8.
Political upheavals
The Democratic Unionist Party, with whom the current Prime Minister has had to make terms, is itself a result of political upheavals within Northern Ireland. It was founded in 1971 by Ian Paisley in reaction to an official Unionist Party which he characterized as bourgeois, unrepresentative and  worst of all  getting dangerously soft towards Nationalists and Catholics.
However, the DUP ended by not only replacing the Official Unionists, but stealing their clothes by agreeing in 2006 to govern the province in concert with Sinn Fin  who had themselves outflanked the constitutional-nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party in a similar manoeuvre.
The underlying reality of the supposed coming together of the extremes, with the accompanying destruction of the moderates, unsurprisingly turned out not to be as reconciliatory as the spinners claimed. The proliferation of Orwellian peace walls throughout the province is one indication; another is the fact that, with Paisley (senior) and Martin McGuinness called to their Maker, the next generation of Northern Irish politicians, green or orange, have made their mutual antipathy viscerally clear.
One result has been the recent suspension of the Stormont assembly, following Sinn Feins refusal to go on working with the DUP leader Arlene Foster after the exposure of her disastrous green-energy policy, in which businesses were essentially incentivized to waste fuel. Another seems to be the DUPs irrational embrace of Brexit  undertaken, apparently, for no very good reason except that Sinn Fein opposed it. However, under the terms of the MayFoster agreement, support for Northern Irelands farmers is heavily emphasized  along with an illogical and delusionary insistence that there be no substantive change to border arrangements with the Republic of Ireland after Brexit stumbles into reality.
Bad news
This indicates that the DUP realize (along with a decisive majority of Northern Irish people) that Britains exit from the European Union is very bad news for them indeed.
This is a view taken a fortiorisouth of the border, among diplomats, business people, farmers and most intellectuals (Irish writers were prominent among the signatories of the letter from international authors to the TLS on June 3, 2016, making a passionate case for a Remain vote). Last month I took part in a panel discussion on Brexit at the Dalkey Literary Festival in Ireland, nearly a year to the day after the referendum. I was forcibly struck by the fact that though the panel had been chosen to represent both sides of the debate (indeed, tipped slightly towards Leavers), the audience seemed entirely, passionately and angrily committed to the idea that Britain is embarked on an irrational course of self-harm; and that this self-inflicted blow will have powerful reverberations on the island of Ireland.
This is not just because Ireland has embraced a European identity with some enthusiasm, as was clear from that Festival audience. The UKs potential economic downturn following Brexit, already ominously spelled out in current British GDP and growth figures, not to mention the pounds precipitous devaluation since last June, carry alarming indications for Ireland; trade to its biggest export market, the UK, has already fallen drastically since the decline of sterling.
The post-Brexit position of the vast number of Irish citizens living in the UK, for all the reassuring noises made in official quarters, still has to be defined. While Londons prominence in the world of international finance is already being fast eroded, the departing bankers seem unlikely to move to Dublin instead. And above all there is the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

Right off to a rocky start
In June, last year, Parliament did what many Sri Lankans did not believe would ever happen: they passed a right-to-information law that gives citizens broad access to the inner workings of their government.
The acts passage was widely seen as a victory. The Centre for Law and Democracy, an international non-profit that analyzes RTI laws around the globe, ranks Sri Lankas as the third best in the world.
Only Mexico and Serbia score higher.
Many officials in President Maithripala Sirisenas government say the law is proof that the state is opening up after years of authoritarianism and war and that the effort delivers a key campaign promise of reform.
But some civil society groups and journalists are saying its too early to judge Sri Lankas new policy. A law, they argue, however well-drafted, can always be hampered by bad implementation.
And early reports show that despite the Acts legal guarantees, major barriers still exist between Sri Lankans and their right to information.
Battle lines drawn
Sri Lankas RTI law went into effect on February 3. Government Information Department Director General Dr. Ranga Kalansooriya said that since then, public agencies are receiving about 100 requests every day.
Analysts said, that is a pretty healthy number.
Strong initial demand is very important, Toby Mendel, who develops the global RTI ranking, said at a press briefing in Colombo earlier this month. You wont get supply without demand.
He said he was happy with Sri Lankas initial numbers. This is very encouraging as a starting position, since normally it takes much longer for request volume to grow, he added.
But he warned that the new RTI system could create an oppositional relationship between government officials, and those seeking information.
Unfortunately, when RTI starts to get used, battle lines get entrenched, he said.
Early RTI filers have experienced those battle lines.
Transparency International Sri Lanka, an international non-profit with an office in Colombo, has filed multiple RTI requests to test the new law.
The organisation had early success with the Election Commission, who responded to their request well within the 14-day time frame outlined by the law.
They said, they ran into problems, however, with the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine. After submitting an RTI request, they were informed that the information officer who deals with RTI submissions was not in, so the request couldnt be processed.
When the information officer did come back, Transparency International said that the ministry rejected their RTI request.
Later, after the non-profit publicized the scuffle online, different officials from the ministry got in touch with the organisation to ask for the names of the officers who rejected their request.
They have not heard from the ministry since, a Transparency International spokesperson said this week.
The Daily News has experienced similar problems while filing RTI requests.
The Daily News has filed a request for data on trash collection in Colombo with the Colombo Municipal Council, amid the citys continuing garbage crisis.
But the CMC does not have a clearly identified information officer to handle RTIs, as is required by law. Calls were directed between multiple people identified as information officers, before being directed to a deputy commissioner of engineering.
At press time, the Daily News has still not received a receipt of its RTI request from the CMC, despite multiple phone calls and emails.
Related and also illuminating, is that Dr. Kalansooriya would not comment for this article. He cancelled a meeting with the Daily News at his office and did not respond to numerous follow-up emails and phone calls.
Lifting the shroud
Transparency International Sri Lankas Executive Director Asoka Obeyesekere said that RTIs rocky start will not resolve unless people use the law.
People say things like my goodness, but is it working. People say things like that, but they dont test the system, he said. I think this is also illustrative of the fact that were coming from a position where this idea of for
mally requesting information from authority is not something which were accustomed to.
He said only a cultural change, and perseverance by individuals, will make the Act work as it should.
Ultimately, were having to deal with a bureaucracy, which is really founded on being a closed government system, he added.
There are indications, though, that the efforts of private citizens using RTI can actually pay off.
Documents supplied by the RTI Commission, the five-member body that rules on contested RTI requests, show how one man in Matara got his local government agencies to be accountable to him.
In February of last year, K.J. Wanniarachchi, a Matara resident, wrote to the Road Development Authority about a fish stall he believed was constructed illegally on Hakmana Road.
They wrote back to him three days later saying that action was being initiated to remove the unauthorized structure. But nothing happened; the fish stall remained for another year.
After the new RTI law went into effect, Wanniarachchi filed a request for more information about the fish stall. Then, within a week, the roadauthority removed it.
So Wanniarachchi made another request, this time for all letters and correspondence made between his initial complaint in 2016 and his recent RTI request, to see why nothing happened until he filed under the RTI Act.
At a hearing in Colombo, the RTI Commission ordered the Road Development Authority to turn those documents over to him.
The most recent government data available shows that the RTI Commission has had to issue 69 directives to public authorities on RTI requests, many at the behest of private citizens.
If courts find that government officials have deliberately obstructed the RTI process, they can be punished with fines, or jail time.
The RTI Act grants Sri Lankans a wide range of legal rights.
Securing those rights on the ground will play out in the ensuing months and years; It will happen in phone conversations with local information officers, and in appeals in front of the full RTI Commission. People are used to being shrouded, blocked off, , Transparency International Sri Lanka RTI Manager Sankhitha Gunaratne, said.
With the new RTI law, she hopes, the state can be seen as their agent, rather than their overlord.

Rodgers maintains two-shot lead at John Deere Classic
CHICAGO AFP July15, 2017 Patrick Rodgers fired a three-under par 68 on Saturday to maintain his two-stroke lead heading into the final round of the US PGA Tour's John Deere Classic in Silvis, Illinois.
Rodgers had five birdies and two bogeys to build a 54-hole total of 16-under 197, two strokes in front of Americans Daniel Berger and Scott Stallings.
Berger climbed up the leaderboard with an eight-under 63 that included nine birdies. Stallings carded a bogey-free 64 that included five birdies and an eagle to join Berger on 199.
It was a further stroke back to American Nicholas Lindheim, whose second-straight 66 included five birdies and an eagle at the 17th, that was followed by his second bogey of the day at the last.
Rodgers, who took the tournament lead with a seven-under 64 on Friday, birdied the second and seventh in the third round before giving a stroke back at the ninth. He rebounded with back-to-back birdies at 10 and 11 and added another stroke at 14before a bogey at 15.
Unfazed, he rolled in a 12-foot par putt at the par-three 16th, and shook off a poor drive to par the 17th.
After closing with one last par, Rodgers said he wouldn't be tempted to play to protect his lead on Sunday, when he'll be seeking a first US PGA Tour title.
With a win he would also earn the final berth in next week's British Open at Royal Birkdale.
This is a nice course to play with the lead because you have to keep the pedal down all day, the 25-year-old said. Sixteen under is not going to win tomorrow.
So I need to go out and make a lot of birdies. It was nice to have that mindset today.
I didn't hit the best shots coming in, but they were aggressive at the flags and I'm going to stay that way tomorrow.  AFP

Rubber master plan to up production to  30,000 metric tons by 2045
The Colombo Rubber traders Association (CRTA) last Friday highlighted the importance of launching the proposed Rubber Master Plan by the Government last year and said that this plan would help to achieve a remarkable increase in the local rubber production up to 30,000 metric tons by the year 2045.
CRTA Chairman Sunil Poholiyadda made these remarks at the 98th AGM of the Colombo Rubber Traders Association.
The AGM was also represented by Plantation Industry Ministry Secretary J.A. Ranjith, Plantation Industry Ministry Advisor Lakna Paranawithana and Chamber Representative Alikle Perera. The AGM was also represented by a large number of personnel involved in the rubber industry.
At the AGM it was also revealed that the objective of forming the CRTA was to facilitate efficiency and transparency between sellers, producers, buyers, exporters and dealers to assist the growth and sustainability of the rubber industry in Sri Lanka and also promote Sri Lankas rubber and rubber products in global markets.Addressing the gathering, Chairman Poholiyadda said that at a time when the CRTA is taking all measures to develop the countrys rubber cultivation to the maximum, the Planters Association has identified over 2,500 hectares of rubber lands of regional plantation companies for clearing for industrial purposes.
He said another reason for the drop in the countrys rubber production is clearing rubber lands due to urbanization and this situation too has become a major threat to the industry.
He said his Association would appeal the Government to look into this matter as such a situation will drop the countrys rubber production in future.
The CRTA Chairman also said the rubber production in the country reduced to 79 million kilos last year from a record number of 88 million kilos achieved during the corresponding period of 2015.
He reminded the gathering that there was a drop in the production of natural rubber by 50 percent compared to production in 2012. The Chairman also highlighted the reason for the drop in the rubber production which was due to the adverse weather conditions which prevailed against the normal weather patterns experienced in the past.
He said 70 percent of the countrys rubber production comes from the small holder sector and with the drop in price, many rubber growers either discontinue harvesting or uprooted rubber trees to generate funds they require.
It is pathetic to say that few years ago the price of a rubber per kilo went up to Rs. 600 and in 2016 a kilo of the same rubber dropped to Rs. 200.
He however said that the prices of natural rubber went up to Rs. 400 at the Colombo auction this month.
The CRTA Chairman further said that the domestic consumption of rubber has increased from 127 million kilos in 2015 to 142 million kilos in 2016.
Ministry of Plantation Industries Advisor Lakna Paranawithana mentioned the launched Rubber Master Plan was already launched and said the preparations of this plan is being done by officials in the Ministry.
He said the Ministry has also completed the establishment of the Rubber Secretariat at Diyawanna Gardens to carry out further development activities in the industry.

The issue has been dragged unnecessarily for too long and none of the stakeholders is gaining by it. In this critical juncture, we join hands with the majority of voices which demand to take over this institution in to a government mechanism, he said in the statement.

Moreover, Cabinet approval has also received for the SME Authority and its structure is being worked out by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce officials at present. The Minister was addressing the inauguration of Aadhayam 2017 exhibition held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH).
These are being set up to facilitate and develop our SMEs and not to regulate them. Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghes vision is to create a million jobs without taking funds from the general public.
The Small Medium Enterprise (SME) sector of Sri Lanka has been identified as a strategic sector in the policy objectives of the Government. It is also a driver of change for inclusive economic growth, regional development, youth employment and poverty reduction.
There are a little more than one million registered SMEs and MSMEs in Sri Lanka. Each provides employment to three people on average, especially in rural areas. We believe that SMEs are 75% of the total number of enterprises in the economy providing 45% of the employment and contributing to 52% of the Gross Domestic Production (GDP). With the increasing trend of globalization the SME sector has become a driving force for growth and development.
In a bid to develop youth entrepreneurship, National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA) which comes under the purview of the Industry and Commerce Ministry is creating Sri Lankas first ever SME incubator at a cost of Rs 60 million. The first SME incubator is now almost ready and is located in Makandura in Wayamba University.
The incubator will teach many future entrepreneurs about creating their own businesses. Another key role of this incubator is technology transfer to new SMEs and entrepreneurs.
In addition, on the instructions of Ministry of Industry and Commerce, NEDA has made a request to Lanka Sathosa and private sector supermarkets such as Cargills, Keells and Arpico to provide shelf-space in their super markets for micro, small and medium entrepreneurs (MSMEs). It was also requested to provide them at concessionary rates to market their products. Instead of providing shelf space to them they agreed to market their products in the super market.

Sri Lankan Navy arrests four Tamil Nadu fishermen in Neduntheevu

Four Tamil Nadu fishermen were arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy today while fishing in their territorial waters, Indian Police said.
The fishermen from Jagadapattinam in Pudukottai district were arrested for fishing off Neduntheevu near the Sri Lankan coast and were taken to Kangesanthurai by the Sri Lankan naval men along with their boat.
This is the fourth time the Sri Lankan Navy arrested Tamil Nadu fishermen this month.
The fishermen ventured into the sea four days ago before they were arrested, they said.
On 13 July, seven fishermen from Mandapam near Rameswaram were arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy at Neduntheevu and taken to Kangesanthurai port, for allegedly fishing in Sri Lankan boarders.
The Tamil Nadu government has maintained that the retrieval of Katchatheevu, an islet ceded to Sri Lanka in the 1970s, was the "only solution" to the vexed fishermen's issue.

## Title: Tackling tactics!
## Supertitle:

Tackling tactics!
He has often been dubbed as one of Sri Lankas rugby legends. Once he tackles the ball, there is no stopping him. He has led his team towards achieving many victories. He has also represented Sri Lanka in many international tournaments, both in 7 a side and 15 a side. With stints like playing for the Asia Pacific Barbarians and Auckland Blues and training along with Northland ITM Cup Development Squad under his belt he has evolved to become Sri Lankas rugby prodigy as a stand-out player across Asia, setting a benchmark in the process. Yasara Abeynayake reveals that there is much more to her husband, the former Sri Lankan sevens and fifteens skipper and prolific fly-half Fazil Marija, than meets the eye.
Life with Fazil in three words
Calm  Fazil does not lose his cool easily. So even if I lose my temper at certain stages he just keeps quiet. Due to this tactic I too cool down quickly. We also live in a calm and peaceful area in Kandy.
Peaceful  Fazil dislikes keeping problems in his head. Even if there is an issue, he just sleeps it off and wakes up refreshened.
Security  Even if I have any issues: familywise or socially, I know that Fazil is always there for me. He does not give up on things easily. He always tries harder than anyone else around me to make things work.
The meeting
I am not actually a sports fan. I used to work at a private television channel. I got to know Fazil through that. After leaving the job I met him about a year later and since we have met each other before we began chatting regularly.
From friend to fianc
We were friends for about a year. Neither he nor I were ready for a relationship then. I was based abroad for a span and even then the connection was still there. We used to talk over the phone, text and skype. By the time I returned back to Sri Lanka the realization had sunk in both of us that this is more than a friendship. So on my return we became a couple - officially.
He is the one
I actually did not know that Fazil is the one. Even after he proposed to me I was still pretty nervous about it. Everything was happening pretty fast. We got a nekatha (auspicious day) for our wedding three months after he proposed. However, I had great faith in him and believed that whatever he has said, he had said from the heart. I thank my lucky stars that I chose correctly and it worked out well! We tied the knot in December 2, 2015. Our registration was at Kingsbury Hotel and the wedding reception was at Galle Face Hotel.
Religious differences
Fazil is a Malay Muslim and I am a Catholic. There was no opposition from my parents since I come from a mixed family. My father is a Buddhist and my mother is a Christian. Therefore we are used to mixed religion marriages. However I do have very strong religious connections from my extended family and so does Fazil. Naturally, both sides had concerns but we told them that religion is a spiritual aspect that you practice for yourself. You dont need to make it a big deal. So we went ahead with our plans, respecting both sides, and so far so good
His passions vsher passions
I am totally not a sports freak. I am more of an arty person. I love drama, theater, movies and music. I guess this passion derives from my grandfather - the late Gamini Fonseka. He has four daughters. He did not want any of them to get into acting. Only his son, Damith, took up the profession. Therefore I was not really pushed towards the acting side. However I was behind the camera, producing and directing programs.
Fazil likes music but he is not into other forms of art. Therefore it is mostly my friends who accompany me to the theater. However we are united in our passion for music. I like various genres of music but Fazil is into the guys stuff like hip hop and RnB.
Daily schedule
Fazil is employed at MAS, Kandy. He wakes up around 6 am and heads off to the gym. He goes to his work place straight from the gym. He is allowed to leave work early during the season because of his sports commitments. Therefore he goes for his training session. He is usually out till around 6.30 pm.
Free time
Fazil has an active schedule. He moves from his desk job to exercising, running and training. That is very energy consuming. Therefore, whenever he gets some free time he likes to relax at home and not do too much.
Travelling
Fazil and I wanted to travel as much as possible before having a baby. However I became pregnant one and a half into the marriage. We have been to Wales a couple of times and that has become our favourite holiday destination.
Most gloriousmoment in rugby
Fazil has quite a number of outstanding moments in his life. This is because he had to play the role of captaining the Kandy team, the Sri Lanka 7 and 15 teams. He has quite a lot of milestones in his life so it is difficult to pick out just one moment.
Happiestmemories in life
When Fazil captains a side they usually end up winning always. So winning a tournament goes down as a happy reminiscent down memory lane.
On a more personal note Fazil has sweated a lot over trying to build a house for us. He has been struggling with the process for four or five years. Finally this year we managed to move into our own home in Polgolla, Kandy. He has been collecting money for the house for a long time.
Greatest strengthand greatest weakness
Fazil is extremely hard working. I havent seen someone working like that in a long time. If he wants something done he would even turn the world upside down and make sure that it is done. That is his greatest plus point. His weakness is that he is very forgetful. Even if I tell him something now, he would forget all about it in two minutes! I have to keep on reminding him and then I start sounding like a nag!
Particulars
Fazil is not a fussy person but he is very stern with time management. That is the only time he gets annoyed with me because I am usually flexible with time. If he wants something done, it should be done on the dot!
Foodwise
Fazil loves anything fried. Roti and fried chicken are his idea of a perfect meal. Whatever meal he takes, he wants me to include at least one fried item. He likes my cooking. I am ok with anything. I dont eat most meat items except for chicken and seafood.
We are open to try anything new when we dine out. We both are fans of the Japanese cuisine.
Birthday celebrations
Fazils birthday is in December and his father passed away during the same month. So he does not like to celebrate his birthday. We usually have a quiet meal. I invited a few friends over and whipped up a meal for his last birthday. I have gone off the whole party stage for my birthdays too. So we headed off down south and spent the day together at a hotel for my last birthday.
Most touching gesture
There was some really bad media situation going on when we were dating. Fazil really stood by me through it all despite people calling him and relating all sorts of things. He had a difficult time with his colleagues and social media pressurizing him but he helped me get through it all simply by being by my side.
The expectant father
Fazil is wonderful in that nature. That is not something that I expected in him. He helps me out in various ways, from doing the household chores to getting the babys things organized. I did not anticipate him to be this good at the job! He is eagerly waiting for our child to arrive next month.

Tissa Attanayake case Fifteen witnesses to appear in Court
Fifteen prosecution witnesses including President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are to appear before the Colombo High Court today (17) to testify in the case against UNP former General Secretary Tissa Attanayake for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media during the last Presidential Election for the purpose of affecting the results of then Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena.
The case is to be taken up before High Court judge Wikum Kaluarachchi and to be heard on a day-to-day basis commencing from July 17 to July 28.
On March 20, the Colombo High Court had re-issued summons on the President and Prime Minister to give evidence as the prosecution witnesses in the case.
UNP former General Secretary Tissa Attanayake had been arrested and held in remand custody for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media during the last Presidential Election with the intention of inciting racial or religious hatred among ethnic communities. He is currently out on bail.
The accused had been charged under Section 3(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 of 2007. This is the first time in Sri Lanka that an accused had been indicted in the High Court by the Attorney General for an offence that comes under the ICCPR Act. Additional Solicitor General Wasantha Navaratne Bandara PC with Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama are to lead evidence on behalf of the Attorney General.
Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa with counsel Kanchana Ratwatta are to be appear for Tissa Attanayake.
The Attorney General alleged that Tissa Attanayake had publicly announced on December 22, 2014 that there was a secret agreement between the then Common Opposition Candidate Maithripala Sirisena and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The Attorney General alleged Tissa Attanayake committed an offence under Section 3(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 of 2007 by inciting racial or religious hatred among ethnic communities.
Section 3(1) of the ICCPR cites that no person shall propagate war or advocate national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to cause discrimination, hostility or violence.
The AG further alleged that Tissa Attanayake had committed a punishable offence under Sections 454 and 459 of the Penal Code by forging a document and displaying it to the public as genuine and that the accused had also committed an offence under Section 80-C of the Presidential Election Act for displaying a fake document prior to an election, for the purpose of affecting the result of that election in relation to the personal character or conduct of any candidate. The AG has listed 15 persons including President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as witnesses in the case.

Ton-up Raj leads India into Women's World Cup semis
LONDON, Saturday  India captain Mithali Raj scored her sixth one-day international hundred as she led her side into the last four of the Women's World Cup during a crushing 186-run win over New Zealand in Derby on Saturday.
Raj made 109 in an India total of 265 for seven that also featured Veda Krishnamurthy's 70 off just 45 balls and Harmanpreet Kaur's 60.
New Zealand, one of the pre-tournament favourites, then collapsed spectacularly to 79 all out -- their lowest ever Women's World Cup completed total -- with left-arm spinner Rajeshwari Gayakwad taking five for 15 in her first match of the tournament.
This was a virtual quarter-final between the two sides, with tournament hosts England, reigning champions Australia and South Africa already into the semi-finals ahead of Saturday's final group matches. I'm extremely happy, said Raj. For a couple of us, this will be our last World Cup, so our first aim was to enter the semi-finals.
I've always dreamt of getting runs for my country  that hunger never dies.
Dejected New Zealand captain Suzie Bates admitted: We were nowhere near as good as we needed to be. That's how it's been in pressure games this tournament - we haven't turned up when we needed to.
There's going to be lot of reviews of our team because we were expected to make the semi-finals, added Bates after the White Ferns failed to make the top four for the first time since the tournament's inception in 1973.
India's win saw them book a place in the second semi-final against Australia in Derby on Thursday, with England playing South Africa in Bristol on Tuesday. The final is at Lord's on Sunday, July 23.
England, surprisingly beaten in their opening match by India, topped the all-play-all group standings after defeating the West Indies by 92 runs in Bristol.
Heather Knight, the England captain, led from the front with 67 in a total of 220 for seven.
That proved more than enough as the West Indies were held to 128 for nine in their full 50 overs.
The best part about our squad is that someone steps up every single game, Heather had a crucial knock with the bat and then everyone did their bit with the ball and that's really important, said England's Tammy Beaumont.
We all need to be on form heading into a semi-final.
Australia, who lost by just three runs to arch-rivals England, finished second in the standings on net run-rate after seeing off South Africa by 59 runs in Taunton.
Despite being without injured captain and star batsman Meg Lanning, Australia still made 269 thanks to fifties from Nicole Bolton (79), Ellyse Perry (55) and Beth Mooney (53), with South Africa's Sune Luus taking five for 67.
Laura Wolvaardt struck 71 for South Africa but the Proteas were dismissed for 210 as stand-in Australia skipper Rachael Haynes took two for 12 and Perry and Jess Jonassen also grabbed two wickets each.
We started a little bit off with the ball and strayed a bit with our lines early but the pleasing thing was how we brought it back in the middle overs and got crucial wickets at crucial times, said Jonassen.
Meanwhile Luus added: It's always great to get five wickets in a World Cup, especially against a team like Australia.
We're very excited to play England, hopefully we'll get through to the final.
RESULTS:
* At Bristol: England 220-7, 50 overs (H Knight 67; A Fletcher 3-33) v West Indies 128-9, 50 overs (N Sciver 3-3)
England beat West Indies by 92 runs

India beat New Zealand by 186 runs
* At Taunton: Australia 269, 48.3 overs (N Bolton 79, E Perry 55, B Mooney 53; S Luus 5-67) v South Africa 210, 50 overs (L Wolvaardt 71)

Ube Industries Japan  deepens its roots  with Tokyo Cement
Managing Director of Tokyo Cement Company (Lanka) PLC, S. R. Gnanam in a statement welcomed Ube Singapore Holdings Pte. Ltd.s decision to deepen their investment in the Sri Lankan cement giant.
Ube Singapore Holdings recently bought 10% voting shares of Tokyo Cement, placing itself among the Top 20 shareholders of the public listed company.
Gnanam acknowledged this move by the top-notch regional leader in cement as a clear indication of the confidence they have placed on Tokyo Cements business strategy in the Sri Lankan market.
Tokyo Cement is one of Sri Lankas most valuable brands and is the largest manufacturer and supplier of cement and concrete with an installed capacity of 2.8 Mn Tons.
Gnanam expressed his appreciation to Ube Industries Ltd. Japan, the parent company of Ube Singapore Holdings, who has been a technology services partner of Tokyo Cement until now, on this investment decision. Ube Industries, Ltd. is a leading manufacturer of cement and cement related machinery. Ube Industries Ltd. is further involved in manufacturing of chemicals, plastics, battery materials and pharmaceuticals.
The existing Technical Services Agreement between the two companies facilitate the exchange of innovative product knowledge and technical expertise in cement production.
This investment through its fully owned Singaporean subsidiary will strengthen Ube Japans engagement with the local blue-chip to further improve its manufacturing excellence and superior product quality.
According to Gnanam, every year Tokyo Cement sends groups of its technical staff to be trained under Ube Industries scientists and technical experts.
Furthermore, Tokyo Cement imports high quality clinker from Ube Industries Japan that is used in the manufacturing of NIPPON CEMENT-PRO, the highest performing cement in Sri Lanka, especially formulated for high-rises and super structures.
He highlights the massive expansion drive the company is on at the moment, as part of which a hi-tech cement mill was commissioned in Trincomalee to nearly double the capacity, as a key contributor to enhance shareholder confidence. Ube Singapore Holdings is among the many investors who were observed to reiterate their confidence at the bourse on this growth momentum of the company. With this nod of encouragement from their Japanese principal, Gnanam assured that the company will further strengthen Tokyo Cements leadership position in the Sri Lankan market.

USA beat Nicaragua 3-0 to top Gold Cup Group B
LOS ANGELES AFP July16, 2017The United States survived two missed penalties to beat Nicaragua 3-0 in Cleveland on Saturday and reach the Gold Cup quarter-finals as winners of Group B.
Goals from Joe Corona, Kelyn Rowe and Matt Miazga lifted the Americans against a lively Nicaragua side.
Bruce Arena's men went into the contest needing a three-goal win to top the group after Panama's 3-0 win over Martinique in the opening match of the day's double-header. For a time it looked as if they wouldn't get there, but Chelsea defender Miazga's 88th minute header spared the Americans from a quarter-final date with dangerous Costa Rica. Miazga earned his third international cap as Arena changed all 11 of his starters from the side that edged minnows Martinique on Wednesday.
The United States threatened early as Rowe fired straight at Nicaragua keeper Justo Lorente in the seventh minute.
Dom Dwyer and Zusi also went close, the latter surging into the box but firing straight at Lorente.
It was Corona who grabbed the opener in the 36th minute.
Alejandro Bedoya's cross from the right found Corona, whose shot from the top of the area was deflected inside the near post.
They doubled the advantage in the 56th, when Rowe, played through by Bedoya, beat Lorente for his first international goal.
But two second-half chances from the spot went begging. Dwyer's penalty attempt, after the English-born striker was brought down in the box, was easily saved by Lorente. After Rowe's goal, a Daniel Cadena handball gave the American's another chance, but Corona's effort was also saved.

Vidya murder: Senior DIG remanded
Senior DIG Lalith Jayasinghe who was arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department in connection with the Jaffna schoolgirl Vidya Sivaloganathan rape and murder case on Saturday was remanded until July 25 by the Kayts Magistrate Courts.

We need to stop judging people who dont read a lot
I read a lot. I read quite a lot. And I consider myself a big fan of books. But Im here to tell you the two arent mutually exclusive. You dont have to be some speed-reading super-bookworm to be enjoy the simple pleasure of a good read.
Usually when someone tells me they dont read all that much or theyre not much of a book person, they say it almost like theyre ashamed. Theres this tacit assumption I might be judging them for not being more well-read (which I try not to, although I know I havent succeeded in the past). To be fair, its a similar situation with TV shows and movies, as well, where there is so much content out there and we all feel like we are constantly catching up on what everyone else has already enjoyed.
Cinematic Universe
But I think the feeling you get when you havent read Between the World and Me, or A Room of Ones Own, can be more severe than the feeling of not having seen the latest season of X or the next instalment in the Y Cinematic Universe. Bookswhether novels, memoirs, biographies, poetry, etc.still have this association with intelligence, wisdom, and even class status. Being well-read is still a synonym for learned or cultured, so thinking you dont stack up next to someone who has read more books than you is an exercise in lessening your own worth.
But not having read Emma or The Makioka Sisters doesnt make you unintelligent or less valuable than the person who has. Reading can help us grow our mental faculties, including knowledge, problem-solving skills, and empathy, but you dont automatically become a better person because you finished War and Peace.
And oftentimes, people who consider themselves well-read can be a bit aggressive about it. Anytime I say or post about a book Ive enjoyed, most of the responses are gigantic To-Do Lists of ever other book by the same author or in the same genre I also have to read right away, what are you doing, go buy these books right now, go!!!
Show-off
People who have read We Should All Be Feminists or The Year of Magical Thinking love to talk about these books (and why wouldnt you), but that need to discourse can so easily turn into a need to show-off. People who consider themselves well-read have a tendency to inundate others with all the books theyve read or get into some kind of pissing contest over whos read the most.
And honestly, I find this extremely annoying. If books are supposed to help us cultivate experience, imagination, and compassion, then why are we using books as weapons to make ourselves feel superior Again, Im including myself in here, because Ive definitely fallen into this trap time and time again.
The problem with this attitude is that it can be alienating to the people who just havent read as many books. Everyone knows its good to read a lot, but feeling like youre already at a disadvantage compared to your seemingly well-educated friends is disheartening and can even act as a barrier to reading even a single piece of literature.
If my stack of books to-read gets too high, I feel overwhelmed and will either start and stop several of them or never start any of them. Its so much worse if you feel like you have read enough books and anyone you would go to in order to get a good recommendation treats you like youre such a dumb-dumb for not having cracked as many spines as them.
Social media
So Im saying this: if you have read a lot, thats great. Really, thats wonderful, keep it up! If you havent, thats not a bad thing. Its nothing to be ashamed of and it doesnt make you an unintelligent person, no matter what some people posting commenting on social media posts or talking too-loudly in bars will tell you. You should read A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, or The Bloody Chamber, or A Good Man is Hard to Find, or Fangirl when you can, please do, its so incredibly worth it! But dont feel like you have to check off every book on the 1,001 things to read before you die or whatever lists. Find a good book, one that interests you, and start there. And look, this is coming from someone who earlier professed to have read quite a lot: the quantity of books you read is not even remotely as important as the quality. Try to find a book that is famous for being challenging and take a crack at it. Or find something that is really enjoyable to read even though the plot didnt interest you at first. But dont feel off-put by self-professed well-read know-it-alls (like me) because, in truth, we dont know it all.
We still have so much to learn and even though weve read all these tons of books (you cant see it, but Im gesturing wildly at my bookshelves), that doesnt make us wiser. There are things that you will find in All Quiet on the Western Front, or Beloved, or A Tale for the Time Being, or Ceremony, or even that hulking behemoth Moby-Dick that I completely missed.
And dont feel like you have to keep up with those crazy speed-readers out there, either. Find a pace that works for you and your life. And find some quality stuff worth reading (this website is chock full of them!). Its totally OK if you dont read a whole lot. Just dont stop reading.

But instead of the money, the SP privided the family a house in Gonapinuwala to reside. She said in her complaint that she was only around 25 years old when she faced this ordeal and studying for an external degree.
She had said that she was compelled to lodge this complaint became the former SP who retired as a DIG was pestering and threatening them demanding the house back.
Galle District SSP Chandana Kariywasam said Galle Police would conduct investigations into the complaint and send a dossier to the Attorney Generals Department for instructions regarding the future course of action as the relevant Police officer was now retired.

## Title: Women should freeze OVARIES - not eggs - if they want to protect their fertility

Women should freeze OVARIES - not eggs - if they want to protect their fertility
Women should freeze their ovaries rather than their eggs to save their fertility, experts claim.More than a third of women who freeze ovarian tissue go on to have a baby, a study has found. The authors say ovary freezing, only currently available in Britain for medical reasons, should now be looked at for healthy women too.
Egg freezing, which costs $10,000-$12,000 in the US (around 5,000 in the UK), has been done by almost 4,000 women afraid of running out of time to have a baby.
But it means returning to a clinic for IVF, while women who are past the age of menopause need hormone replacement therapy to have a child with their own eggs.
Freezing ovarian tissue goes much further by offering older women the chance to turn back the clock, reverse their menopause and get pregnant naturally without the need for fertility treatment.
The study from New York Medical College found almost 38 percent of women had a baby after ovarian freezing.
Co-author Dr Fernanda Pacheco said: The procedure is superior to egg freezing as it can also reverse menopause and restore natural fertility. The next frontier is to explore the procedures potential in delaying childbearing among healthy women, not just cancer patients.
The first woman in Britain to give birth after having an ovary removed as a child, frozen and re-implanted was Moaza Al Matrooshi. The 24-year-old had her ovarian tissue frozen aged nine ahead of chemotherapy to treat a rare blood disorder, and had her baby son last December.
US researchers examined every case of ovarian tissue freezing recorded between 1999 and October last year.
Women up to the age of 40 gave birth to 84 children after 309 freezing procedures, with eight having more than one child using frozen ovarian tissue. Almost two out of three women were able to reverse their menopause or restore their reproductive function. Close to two-thirds were able to conceive naturally only about one third needed IVF.
This is because frozen ovarian tissue contains immature eggs, which grow into mature eggs when it is replaced in a womans body. This restarts her monthly cycle and releases estrogen, allowing her to get pregnant naturally.
Responding to the findings, Dr Melanie Davies, a consultant gynecologist specializing in reproductive health at University College Hospital in London, said: The two reasons that women might be attracted to ovarian tissue freezing are that they can conceive naturally and there is no need for HRT after the menopause.
But this is not yet available and the long-term outcomes are still not known. Egg freezing is now widespread and it is a proven technique.
Ovarian tissue freezing is not science fiction but it is a long way off for non-medical reasons in Britain. Women considering freezing need to be well-informed so they can make informed decisions for themselves.
The technique is available only to women left infertile by medical treatment in Britain, mainly cancer patients, although women in the US can pay to have their ovarian tissue frozen simply because they want a baby at an older age.
There is no way of comparing ovarian freezing pregnancy rates with egg freezing rates in the United States, as national figures are not recorded.
Ovarian tissue was kept on average for just over two years in the cases looked at for the latest study, and it warns that some procedures failed because women were older.
There also remains the possibility that failed procedures have not been included in the reports looked at.
The new study is published in the journal Reproductive Sciences, where authors Dr Pacheco and Dr Kutluk Oktay write: Despite the clinical progress within the past two decades, the procedure still remains in the experimental realm.
Now women considering this procedure to preserve fertility and postpone childbearing have more information at their disposal. Given these recent data, ovarian tissue cryopreservation should be considered as a viable option for fertility preservation. Women in the US can typically pay about 8,000 to have their ovarian tissue frozen because they want a baby at an older age.

WHAT DOES EGG-FREEZING INVOLVE FOR PATIENTS
1. HORMONE INJECTION
Women inject high levels of hormones for a week in order to ovulate as many eggs as possible.
Patients typically have to pay anywhere from $2,000 to $4,000 for these - whether at Extend or elsewhere.
This hormone is called AMH (Anti-Mullerian Hormone), which is secreted in the ovarian follicles.
AMH levels are a marker of ones fertility: women with a high level are likely to produce more eggs.
The patients doctor will perform a blood test to check their AMH levels and determine the exact concentration of hormones they need.
2. EXTRACTION
After about 10 days, the patient comes in for their retrieval.
The surgeon retrieves the eggs through the vaginal wall.
The patient is then taken to the post-operation area.
3. NEXT RETRIEVAL OR FREEZING
The patient will be immediately told how many eggs were retrieved.
Within a couple of days, they will learn how many of those eggs were mature - i.e. how many can be frozen.
In most clinics, patients with fewer than 12 eggs will then have an option: to settle with that or to pay for another cycle. Those with 12 or more will can set up payment for storage or do IVF.

Youngest woman to ever captain a Boeing 777
At just 30-years-old Anny Divya is the youngest woman ever to captain a Boeing 777 . But realising her dream hasnt been easy.
Anny started training to be a pilot at the age of 17, and although she was supported by her parents, other family members did not agree with her career choice.
But Anny, who grew up in Andhra Pradesh, India, refused to listen to her critics.
Instead she persevered with her career path until she was able to join the Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi (IGRUA), a flying school in Uttar Pradesh.
She went on to train in Spain and London before gaining her wings as a qualified commercial flyer.
Anny credits her entire success to her mother and father, who is a retired army official.
When she struggled financially, she said her parents helped her cover the costs of the education, despite having no guarantee that she would ever be in a secure enough position to pay the money back.
Anny told Times Now : I am thankful to my parents and teachers for what I am today.
My parents really believed in my goal and let me fly. There were no jobs at the time, so its not like the money my parents were putting in was something that I could earn later. Nobody was doing any pilot course in Vijayawada at that time. So I was not encouraged to do it by a lot of people around me. But I just wanted to fly.
Anny admitted it was not easy, and said she was bullied for her English skills while she tried to grasp the language. She said: People made fun and laughed at me but I knew that I had to speak  even if I made mistakes - to actually learn.
People used to mock me for my poor English and that hurt me a lot. Anny refused to give up, and continued to try out her English skills at her flying school, until she had a much better grasp of pronunciation.
Then aged 19, she travelled to Spain for further training, which is where she first flew a Boeing 737.
Then, aged 21, Anny was sent to London to complete advance training and piloted a Boeing 777 for the first time. Amazingly, being the youngest female captain of a Boeing 777 is not the only impressive part of Annys story. She has also earned a degree in BSC Aviation, is a classical keyboard player, a dancer  and has a post-graduate degree in law. Mirror

Boom in finance jobs as a result of economic changes
With the US dollar to Sri Lankan rupee exchange rate touching an all time high of 153, the Sri Lankan economy is going through major changes.
One of the primary causes for depreciation of the rupee has been the widening trade deficit.
The government on its part has been enacting reforms such as the changes in the VAT act in late 2016 with a goal to increasing revenue and decreasing public deficit.
Such reforms affect all businesses in the country. Consequently, one profession that is booming due to these economic changes is finance. According to the quarterly career report published by everjobs.lk, the accounting and finance job category has the highest number of vacancies and attracted the most number of job applications during the past three months.
Accounting and finance is closely followed by IT in terms of job creation and job applications. This is evident from the fact that data entry and IT were among the most searched for jobs on everjobs.lk during the months of April, May and June 2017.
The IT industrys goal is to achieve US$ 5 billion in exports by 2022, creating 200,000 jobs and helping 2,000 tech start-ups. Sri Lanka was ranked 12th in the world by IBM for business process outsourcing.
The Sri Lankan BPO industry attracts Fortune 500 customers such as Google, J.P. Morgan & Co, Microsoft, Emirates and Qatar Airways.
Although finance is and will continue to be one of the core functions of any company, there is still a shortage of quality financial professionals in the country, explains Rushabh Sheth, Managing Director at everjobs.lk. However I believe that this trend is temporary and Sri Lankas future lies in IT. We produce some of the top software engineers from colleges such as the University of Moratuwa who are highly competitive at a global level. With the booming BPO industry, needless to say, IT and software engineers are some of the most in-demand talent in the job market and we will see this trend continuing in the future.
The job market, however, experienced a shift in terms of the most desirable professions among jobseekers during the second quarter of 2017. While HR-related jobs were the most attractive positions to professionals throughout 2016, internships and trainee jobs were highly sought after in Q2 2017. This is predominantly due to the fact that students are realizing the need for training to be competitive in the current job market.

Sri Lanka moves closer to FTA

No less than six exhaustive sessions of official talks have been wrapped to-date in Sri Lankas pursuit of the coveted Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the worlds second largest economy.
Our talks with China are progressing smoothly, said an upbeat Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen on Friday in Colombo.
Minister Bathiudeen was addressing the launch event of the first ever product exhibition in Sri Lanka by Chinas Guangxi Zuang Autonomous Region at Colombos SLECC. The event was joined by Deputy DG of Department of Commerce of Guangxi, Xiong Jiajun and a 40-man strong trade and exhibition delegation of which 35 were event exhibitors from Guangxi. Also attending the event was Charge daffairs of Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka Pang Xunshie.
In recent years, China-Sri Lanka two way trade has grown faster than our trade with many other countries. Last year China became the largest import origin for us. 42% of our total imports from the world in 2016 came from China at a value of $ 4.2 billion. The result was that china is now the largest global supplier to Sri Lanka, said Minister Bathiudeen.
According to the Sri Lanka Department of Commerce (SLDoC) Sri Lankas top exports to China last year were Ceylon Tea, coconut, footwear parts, apparel, and rubber tyres. Sri Lankas largest export to China five years ago was various types of fibres immediately followed by Ceylon Tea, but by last year, Ceylon Tea has crowned the exports list to be followed by fibres. Though Lankan exports declined somewhat in 2016 to $199 mn from 2015 high of $293 mn, in general, exports to China have been on an upward trend-surging more than 5 fold (568%) since 2007s mere $35 mn. Top imports from China last year were mobile phones, boats & vessels, handmade fabrics, and petroleum. Mobile phones remained as the largest import item from China to Sri Lanka during the last five year period.
Minister Bathiudeen added: Also recently IMF and World Bank ranked China as the worlds largest economy based on Purchasing Power Parity.

UNP back-benchers will guard Yahapalana Government
UNP back-benchers will guard the Yahapalana Government at all cost, UNP MP Bandulal Bandaragoda said while accusing former President Mahinda Rajapaksa of pulling the leg with talks of toppling the joint government.
UNP MP Bandulal was addressing the media yesterday at Sirikotha.
He said the joint government was solid and a change of regime was a pipe dream of an insignificant political group craving for power.
The Galle District MP was referring to the recent press report that some SLFP parliamentarians had demanded the removal of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe from his office, or else permission to sit with the Opposition.
MP Bandulal said Maithripala Sirisena assured at the 2015 Presidential Election campaign that in a government led by him, Ranil Wickremesinghe would be the Prime Minister.
I would like to invite the people who say the Premier should be removed, to watch again the first press conference held by Maithripala Sirisena when he walked out of MRs government. The people who demand the removal the Premier should check their heads. MP Bandulal said.
MP Bandulal said talks of toppling the government could possibly be a tactic to stop foreign investments from flowing into the country. He said they may be trying to scare off with such talks the government officers who are conducting investigations into crimes and scams that took place in MRs time.
He said most serious issues the present Good-governance Government has to deal with are the ones that the MR's regime created and left behind.
We are still paying for the sins of Mahinda Rajapaksas government. They left us several garbage mountains similar to Meetotamulla and many others; the mountain of debts is the most serious. The SAITM issue and the loss of GSP+ are other issues the government is dealing with thanks to the previous regime, he said.
Bandulal said Rajapaksa would be trapped in his own ploy if he keeps on interfering in the Yahapalana Government.
He said the Yayapalana Government did not influence entities that are carrying out investigations. They should be allowed to act independently. We are sure that they will carry out investigations properly and convict the lawbreakers, he said.
The MP said the Anti-corruption Secretariat should not have been closed, but the country has institutions with similar capacity for the people to go and report on corruptions.
He said religious places should not be used for political purposes since it would destroy Buddhism in the country and the UNP never offered nominations to Bhikkus in its 60-year history.

The Minister was addressing a dengue control programme at Beruwala on Saturday.
Minister Senaratne said the report recommends to reduce number of dengue patients by 50 percent within four weeks. The WHO is willing to offer financial assistance in this regard. He said the Health Ministry could not control dengue by itself and everyone should participate in the battle.
It is same in other countries where dengue is present, he said.
The Minister thanked media institutions for coming forward and contributing immensely to the dengue control programme without focusing on profit making.

T.B.L Moonemalle
He was an honourable man
On this day, 111 years ago, on July 17, 1906, Theodore Barcroft Lewis Moonemalle, a Proctor of the Supreme Court, was appointed to the Legislative Council of Ceylon. The appointment, which made him a senator, took place two days before his 38th birthday. On this day, that marks the appointment of a senator from a bygone era. I thought I would write this small tribute to the memory of a personality of whom I have heard of from my late maternal grandfather Edmund Eramudugolla, as well as from two of my maternal grandauntsSeemanthani Madugalle Panabokke and Ranjini Madugalle.
T.B.L Moonemalle was my late maternal grandmotherNalini Madugalle Eramudugollasmaternal grandfather; thus, making him my great-great grandfather from the maternal side of my family. Born on July 19, 1868, he hailed from the Kandyan upper crust ensconced in Kurunegala. He had received his school education at Trinity College, Kandy. And he was, as told by my elders, subsequent to being made a senator, bestowed the title of Dissawe of Kurunegala, which was understandably at the time a titular honour bearing ceremonial function sans jurisdiction. His father John Marcellus Moonemalle was also a Proctor of the Supreme Court.
I was told by my late maternal grandfather aforementioned, that T.B.L Moonemalle was a freemason and that he was the founder of the masonic lodge in Kurunegala. And I was told the masonic hall in the Kurunegala town which still stands to this day had been donated by him.
This detail about my great-great grandfather intrigued, me owing to the aura of mystery and secrecy associated with the topic of freemasonry.
My late grandfather also told me that T.B.L Moonemalle used to go on horseback to visit his estates around Kurunegala, but was not known to actually ride around inside the properties since he was pressed for time and ordepending on the mood, perhapsjust couldnt be bothered to inspect the state of the crops. He supposedly rode up to the gate/entry point of an estate, had a valet summon the conductor of that estate, ask him as a matter of routine if everything was in order, drink a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice respectfully served by the conductor and then head back to town where he resided. With his wife Enid Jayatileke, he had two sons and three daughters.
The eldest child was Neville and the youngest, Donovan. And between the two boys were the three daughters; Mignon, who married Justice Earl Wijewardene; Lucille, whose husband was Sir Richard Aluvihare (the first Ceylonese Inspector General of Police) and Myra, my great grandmother who married Arthur Madugalle whose father was then the Ratemahaththaya of Udu Dumbara and incidentally a grandson of Madugalle Udagabada Nilame who was one of the principal figures to give leadership to the Great Uprising of Uva Wellassa in 1818.
And thus, on this day, I thought it befitting to offer a salute to the life and memory of a forbearer whose life and times, although perhaps not widely recorded, surely would have been fascinating, in a milieu that is far removed from the social and political landscapes of today. Dilshan Boange

Daddy, it has been only three months, but it seems like a lifetime since you passed away. Words can never express how very much we miss you.
Everything I see around reminds me of you and a tear drop falls. The times you held my hand and the times I held your hand, it was a journey and a story that I hold so precious in my heart with loads of love and gratitude for you. Mummy couldn't have asked for a better husband and the four of us were blessed with the most precious daddy.
We have great joy and pride in looking back, as you lived a life to the fullest and gave us nothing but the best. You gave us hope, strength and grace to make our world a better and a brighter place. You were by our side to help and support us, to celebrate us, to understand our problems, and accept our defeats. You taught us the value of hard work, good judgment, courage and integrity and said till the end, "Take it with a pinch of salt.
Daddy, you were like no other. I'm still trying to figure out how you never yelled at us, wondering how you got another pet for malli every time he lost one or even how you bought my friend a pair of shoes because I threw one over the roof of the school and it got stuck.
Daddy, you went even further and spoiled the grandchildren to your best. You took them to places whether in Sri Lanka, Australia or New York; taught them jokes and tricks to share with their friends and made them laugh. I love the day you held the umbrella to Mario to play in the rain and both of you getting muddy faces. And best of all, they have your wit to carry on in life's journey.
I could go on and on. Daddy, you were just wonderful in million different ways. For that, we are forever grateful.
We will always hold you precious in our hearts, that special smile, that caring heart and for being there for mummy and us rain or shine. Your love will forever dwell in our hearts.
We love you and miss you more than words could ever say.
Rest in Peace, daddy and may God bless us to be together once again.

Susan George Pulimood
Visakhas legacy
Susan George Pulimood was born to a Syrian Christian family in Travancore South India in 1907. She graduated from Queen Mary College and did her Masters at Presidents College South India.
Coming over to Ceylon during World War 1, she joined the staff of Visakha Vidyalaya in 1941, then functioning from Bandarawela due to the war. Botany was her forte, having authored a book in her early years. Together with Botany, she also taught Maths and English Literature. She often quoted poets and philosophers, to inculcate good values in her students.
At the end of the war, the school relocated in Colombo and in 1946, Pulimood was appointed its principal, which post she adorned for an unbroken record of 22 years.
No sooner she took over, she opened the Science Stream at Visakha with the help of a few of her colleagues from India and fortified by male and female Science graduates from Sri Lanka. Laboratories were set up and equipped suitably and she made sure our Science students forged ahead to achieve great heights.
Today, at every hospital and medical Institute there is at least one Visakhian holding a prestigious post thanks to her courageous vision. This years Orator is no exception. Dr. Iyanthi Abeywickrema is a fellow of the College of Venereologists, Senior Fellow, PGIM an expert on STD/AIDS control programmes in Sri Lanka, and a former Advisor to the WHO.
In 1950, the school was conferred Grade 1 status, and in 1959 Super Grade Status in keeping with the extensive facilities available to its students. Pulimood didnt neglect the Arts stream. She strengthened the Fine Arts by making sure all co-curricular activities took equal importance in the school calendar. English and Sinhala drama, dance, and music performances of high calibre were executed with much joy and finesse. Sports activities were also given the necessary boost and our girls excelled in all these spheres, winning many accolades nationally and internationally.
Pulimood, as a botanist, loved flowers and nurtured the gardens of Visakha to have flowering bushes and large trees with overhanging branches, like the iconic na tree that stood for many years in the centre of our grounds. She often compared her children to flowers and wanted them to be nurtured gently and gracefully. She herself was always gentle and soft spoken. Immaculately dressed in high necked and long sleeved blouses, and draped in beautiful south Indian silks, she cut an impressive figure at our daily assemblies, addressing us from stage with a few lines of advice or admonishment.
She knew every child by name and as she stood on the semicircular steps leading to her office, she would beckon us by name to inquire or admonish us, if we were seen out of class at any given time.
Pulimood was a foreigner and a Christian, but she stamped the Buddhist culture on our educational ethos in an indelible manner. She had bana preached to us every Friday, Ata Sil administered on poya days and the Annual Founders Day pirith and dana conducted with great respect and solemnity.
She taught Visakhians to be confident of their abilities to walk tall and be proud custodians of a special legacy that still lives on. On a personal note, I might add that living in the vicinity of the school, my mother herself an old Visakhian, was a friend to her. She often visited Pulimood at night and found her signing reams of report cards till late into the night commenting on each childs progress, to the best of her knowledge. She never lost that personal touch.
After marriage, my husband and I visited her in India and I shall never forget how she hugged me and told my husband to look after her Visakhian.
As we commemorate her legacy at the Annual Pulimood Oration, all of us who knew her personally, and all those who benefitted from her foresight and vision, bow our heads in saluting a truly great lady of Mother Lanka.
Srini Karunaratne (ne Gunaratna)

S. S. Wijeratne
A brilliant lawyer
It is with profound sorrow that I pen these lines as a tribute to the late S. S. Wijeratne, more popularly known as Sirimega, a great lawyer whom I knew from my collegiate career at St. Bernadette's College, Polgahawela. He hailed from a distinguished family of the North Western Province.
He had his early education at St. Bernadette's College, Polgahawela and later proceeded to Dharmarajah College, Kandy, for higher studies.
He also served the UNO for a long period and returned to Sri Lanka, after which he served the ICLP (Institute for the Development of Commercial Law and Practice) as its Secretary General upto his death.
There were some prominent features in him which contributed immensely to his success as an excellent lawyer and a much-loved and respected human being with a common touch.
His recent demise is a great loss to all who knew him, particularly to his former students spread throughout the country. He was loved and admired by all.
His devotion to duty was unique. He was no believer of caste, creed or colour.
He walked with kings, but never lost the common touch. He was a devout Buddhist.
Men of the stamp, mettle and genius of the calibre of the late S. S. Wijeratne are indeed rare as Sandalwood trees which adorn the jungles of Sri Lanka.
Even though his physical body is no longer with us, his breathing spirit will thrust itself to the lives of those who came in contact with him, constantly reminding the high ideals for which he stood throughout his life.
We owe a deep debt of gratitude to him for his long and exemplary service. Memories of S. S. Wijeratne's life with experience, wisdom and service, will continue to echo for many more years.
His sudden demise is an irreparable loss to all who knew him and particularly to his family members, friends, relations and students, spread throughout the country.
His life could aptly be summed up according to the poem Lives of great men all remind us, we can make our lives sublime and departing, leave behind footprints on the sands of time. Your life, a beautiful memory. Your death, a lasting sorrow. I express my profound sympathies to his beloved wife, children and members of the family. May he attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana!

Amara Wickramasinghe
A social steamroller
There she rides the waves; the waves of time. A lady who played her role with an explorative vision, not geared towards her own private gain or wellbeing, but aimed at the well-being of her community. This pioneer skipper of Kiribathgoda Vihara Maha Devi Balika Vidyalaya, Amara Wickramasinghe, was an indefatigable go-getter with an exceptional gift of clairvoyance. Notwithstanding her indifference to compliments, society keeps singing eulogies to the eternal skipper in eagerness. The present attempt is one such and let us therefore, say in great harmony, "Hip, hip hurrah; you did it! You did the impossible!"
The wheels she put in motion are relentlessly releasing energy to keep society fully-served, fertilised and supplied.
This is a never-ending fountain that spouts as you draw. Can any righteous man/women allow the architect of this eternal machine to live incommunicado No. And that is a flat 'no'. We have made our lives shinning, fecund and soothing, through her wisdom and exceptional managerial skill, prowess and acumen and we are tempted to sing these lullabies in her name.
About five years ago, I was listening to a public discourse being given by a lady seated next to me, who was a woman of, say, fifty or so years. At the conclusion of the oration, she asked me a question; Have you identified this unique personality Yes, I said, "She is Amara Wickramasinghe." "You have to go beyond," she said. "What do you mean I queried. She said, Firstly, there is the choice of location, Kiribathgoda; secondly, the enormous multitude of human beings drawn from the multiple acreages of Kelaniya/Peliyagoda and thirdly, the explorative and pioneering handling, she said.
"It is evident that the lady has shown a spectacular familiarity about things. She continues to travel with consummate ease like a butterfly, going to places and giving surprises to even veterans in the vicinity. Now have you recognized her truly" she asked. The woman, rather authoritatively this time, said, "The lady was constantly in atrial to keep her identity under wraps, but by an inadvertent escapade during her journey, providence betrayed her. Now, it is fact that the appearance is that of the timeless sansaric emergence of that wayfarer." I arose and thanked the women immensely.
But both of us were bound by historys saintly cowl, to prevent us from quoting the private names of the actors vesting upon evidences gathered through the science of kinesics and conclusions. The damsel is historys cherished property and is timeless. That is why she is Amaraa persistent crossword puzzle.
Her beauty will remain intact to prove her immortality'Amarathma.' She will be deeply missed, but her legacy will live on.
Chintha Perera,
On behalf of the members of the Retired Teachers Union,
Vihara Maha Devi Balika Vidyalya,
Kiribathgoda.
Rita Catherine Perera
She was helpful to everybody
It is with profound sorrow that I write a few words in appreciation of Lidamulaga Rita Catherine Perera (nee de Silva) my mother, who passed away peacefully on July 10, 1998. She was 63 at the time of her death. Last Monday was her 19th death anniversary. My mother was the youngest in a family of three. She hailed from a very respectable Catholic family in Polkotuwa Road, Rawathawatta in Moratuwa.
She was the daughter of Gradiyawasam Lidamulage Elarian John de Silva and Annie Margret Fernando. Her only brother L. Francis Joseph Silva (Chandra) retired from the Local Government Service. My mother and Lokuamma were more friend than sisters.
My mother married K. Joseph Mervyn Perera (my father) of Frazer Avenue Moratuwa, late in life. He retired as a time keeper clerk at the Colombo port Commission, now Sri Lanka Ports Authority. After my father's death in 1987, when we were young, my mother took much interest in giving us a good education. The last occasion, on December 1997, I saw her enjoying at my brother Ranjan's wedding. She was a devout Catholic who always worshipped at the nearest church. She never failed to perform her daily religious observances in attending holy mass at St. Sebastian's Church, Moratuwa. My mother Rita's demise was a big loss to all us, particularly to her only daughter and loving sons.
'May her soul rest in peace' is my humble prayer.
Prabath Perera
Saroja Sockalingam Pillai
She was a devout Hindu
We sadly miss Saroja Sockalingam Pillai, a village belle, who was born when her mother was out on a pilgrimage to Old India. Thus, Saroja's birth, which was on March 12, 1945, was peculiarly remembered. Her parents hailed from the Nawalapitiya Shamrock Weligodawatte Plantation.
Saroja passed away peacefully from a complicated illness on March 17, 2014. Her third death anniversary was held this year, with poojas at Sri Kathiresan mighty God Kataragama Devala in Kandy and thereafter, at her home in Meekanuwa, Kandy. To mark the occasion, a ceremony was at her home.
Saroja was the spouse of veteran Veerakesari Central Province journalist Karuppannapillai Parama Sivam who is well-known in the Central Province plantation sector as a commoner, hailed as a sincere friend of all the communities.
Saroja was educated at St. Mary's College, Nawalapitiya. Her mother was Sellamma. Her father was Sockalingam Pillai. He was a medium-scale cultivator.
His home garden was a grove of spice plants and creepers.
Cloves, nutmeg, pepper, yams, oranges, betel creepers, mangoes, bananas, mangosteens and all-spice bushes, were grown in abundance. Saroja spent most of her leisure time to help her cultivator pater in working at that tiny land, after her school work and studies.
Saroja devoted most of her time to studies and was popularly known as an autodidact.
She wore the bonds of matrimony with Karuppannapillai Parama Sivam on December 7, 1966.
They have two daughters, Sivakela and Parimala. Sivakala is employed as an agriculturist attached to the Department of Agriculture at Gannoruwa, Peradeniya. She is married to Sri Dharan, a businessman in Kandy. They have two daughters, Monisa and Deepasika.
Their younger daughter Parimala is a teacher attached to the St. Anthony's Girls' College, Kandy. She is married to the school Principal P. Sivakumaran, Principal of Hindu Senior Vidyalaya, Kandy. They have a 11-year-old son, Laxman, a student of Trinity College, Kandy and a 3-year-old girl, Laxmitha.
An alms-giving was also given to an orphanage in her memory.
May she attain Ama Maha Nivana, the Greatest Blissful Nirvana!
Au revoir!

Asia/Pacific Group money laundering confab begins in Colombo on July 17
The 20th Annual Meeting of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering will be held in Colombo from July 17 -21, with the participation of about 450 local and foreign delegates from 41 member countries and several international observer organisations. President Maithripala Sirisena will be the Chief Guest.
The Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering, more commonly known as the APG, was founded in Bangkok, Thailand in 1997, initially by 13 countries including Sri Lanka.
The APG is the regional body tasked with the monitoring of the effective implementation and enforcement of internationally accepted standards against money laundering and the financing of terrorism, in particular, the Forty (40) Recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) within member countries.
Currently, the APG has a varied membership consisting of small economies in the Pacific to the largest economies in the world such as United States, China, Japan and India. In addition to its permanent member countries, this years APG Annual Meeting will be attended by a number of international and regional observers such as the FATF, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units.
The APG, as the largest FATF-styled Regional Body (FSRB) in the world, plays a pivotal role in the ever-changing global landscape of Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Countering Financing of Terrorism (CFT).
In the context of the revamped version of 40 Recommendations adopted by the FATF in 2012, the APG, through its Mutual Evaluations of member countries, assesses AML/CFT compliance vis--vis a wide range of preventive measures, institutional requirements, enforcement and prosecution issues, sectoral controls, and obligations to achieve mutual legal assistance and international cooperation to freeze and confiscate criminal proceeds.
Apart from Mutual Evaluations, the APG also supports its members by providing technical assistance and training in particular and typologies research to better inform APG members and the general public regarding Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing trends, methods, risks and vulnerabilities.
The APG also assists its members to establish national coordination mechanisms to better utilise resources to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.
The 20th Annual Meeting will be useful for member countries to strengthen international cooperation, review AML/CFT compliance levels and adopt actions to address ML/CFT weaknesses.
The Annual Meeting will be especially significant to Sri Lanka, as Sri Lanka becomes the APG Co-chair for the years 2016-2018 while the country can further show its commitment to implement actions to achieve international AML/CFT standards.
The pre-plenary sessions of the Annual Meeting are scheduled to commence from Saturday, July 15, 2017 onwards.

Point of view
Equity markets bounced back over the week to close at an 18-month high, as the benchmark price index gained ~29 points W-o-W to end ~66 points above the key 6700 index level.
Despite a 20 point loss between Tuesday and Thursday, index gains on Monday and Friday helped pare down the losses over the week.
Markets which remained largely dull till Thursday amid thin trading, recorded average daily turnover levels of ~ LKR 0.51Bn before hitting a notable LKR 1.63Bn on Friday which helped push the average weekly turnover levels to LKR 0.73Bn (5% higher than last weeks average turnover of LKR 0.70Bn and ~19% lower than 2017 daily average turnover of LKR 0.91Bn).
Large parcels which traded on Friday led to overall crossings accounting for ~38% of the total market turnover amid strong interest in Melstacorp (37% of crossings), Access Engineering (23% of crossings) and Hemas Holdings (10% of crossings).
Foreign investors meanwhile continued to be net buyers for the 24th consecutive week to end at LKR 0.76bn despite a marginal outflow on Wednesday this week (~38% higher than last week).
Y-T-D Net Foreign flows (LKR 22.9Bn) to the Colombo Bourse thus recorded the second highest yearly inflow since 2012 (LKR 38.6Bn).
Markets in the week ahead are likely to retain the current momentum whilst looking for direction from greater clarity on the proposed new inland revenue act.
Slower pace of Fed hikes benefit FX/Bond Mkts
Emerging market equities rose to 2-year highs this week as the US Fed appeared to indicate a more gradual pace of rate hikes.
The Fed Reserve Chairs comments to the US congress earlier in the week was interpreted by investors as dovish and indicative of no interest rate hike in Sept17 as US inflation rates remain below the Feds inflation target of 2%.
Emerging market equities and currencies responded buoyantly, as a slower pace of Fed rate hikes could impact the dollar and preserve the relatively wide gap between U.S. and developing-country bond yields.
The weaker USD along with higher interest rates in developing nations has led to record inflows to emerging-market funds in H117.
The US Feds signal of a more gradual pace of hikes is positive for Sri Lankan currency and bond markets as well as it implies that net foreign inflows to G-Secs (which have been positive since Mar17) are likely to continue.
Net inflows to G-secs in Jun17 was Rs. 236Bn vs. Rs. 196Bn in Mar17.
Inflows to G-Secs should help support the LKR which will be vital in the context that oil imports remain high, exports relatively muted and remittances have taken a hit as geo-political tensions in the Gulf region appear to be protracted.
The US adopting a more dovish tone also implies that pressure on Sri Lanka to raise rates is lower, a positive development in light of the fact that GDP growth has slowed over Q416 and Q117.

Barclays in talks to expand Dublin office post-Brexit
Barclays is in talks with Irish regulators about expanding its presence in Dublin in the run up to Brexit. It is the latest financial company to indicate how it is repositioning to cope with the UK's exit from the EU.
Barclays said Ireland provided a "natural base" for the bank as it has operated there for 40 years already.
"In the absence of certainty around an agreement, we intend to take necessary steps to preserve ongoing market access for our customers."
Financial firms have been drawing up contingency plans for how they will continue to access the European single market when the UK leaves the trading bloc.
Companies in other sectors have also been making plans. Earlier on Friday, UK airline EasyJet said it was planning to set up a subsidiary in Austria.
The airline must have an air operator certificate in an EU member country to allow it to continue flying between member states after Brexit. Barclays currently employs about 100 staff in Dublin and the bank said it was talking to regulators over extending its licence there.
Ireland's Government Enterprise and Innovation Minister Frances Fitzgerald said Barclays' decision to expand its presence in Dublin was "a strong vote of confidence in Ireland's growing importance as a gateway into the single market".
Dublin appears to be well-placed in the race to pick up business from financial firms as they plan their post-Brexit strategies.
If financial firms based in the UK lose access to the European single market, they will need a subsidiary in another country within the EU to continue offering services across Europe.
Insurer Legal & General said in May that it planned to relocate parts of its business to the Irish capital. Standard Life is also thought to be likely to choose Dublin.
US bank JP Morgan is buying a Dublin office with space for 1,000 staff and its chief executive has also held a meeting with the Irish prime minister.
Japan's Daiwa Securities, Sumitomo Mitsui and Nomura Holdings will set up subsidiaries in Frankfurt. Goldman Sachs and Standard Chartered are both also reported to be planning Frankfurt moves.
Deutsche Bank has said it could move up to 4,000 jobs to Frankfurt and other EU locations. French banks such as Credit Agricole are more likely to move business to France, and HSBC has indicated it may also move staff to Paris. BBC News

Berchelt retains WBC title against proud Miura
LOS ANGELES AFP July16, 2017 Miguel Berchelt retained his WBC world title Saturday with a unanimous decision over former champion Takashi Miura in the first defence of his super featherweight belt.
Mexico's Berchelt won almost every round and it showed on the lopsided scorecards but the unflinching Miura fought on pride and looked like he could have knocked the champion out at any moment.
I was prepared because I knew I was facing an ex champion, said Berchelt.
He has the toughest left hand in the division. He was hitting me and hurting me sometimes.
But I was always the better fighter. The judges scored the fight 116-111, 120-109 and 119-108 for the 33-year-old Berchelt who won the title with an 11th round upset victory over Francisco Vargas in January.
Japan's Miura (31-4-2, 24 KOs) was hoping to reclaim the WBC title which he held for more than two years before losing to Vargas in 2015.
Berchelt set the tone early in the 12-round clash at the Los Angeles Forum as he dropped Miura late in the first round and rocked him with a hard punch in the fifth round that snapped the challenger's head back.
Down on points heading into the sixth round, Miura went looking for the knockout and it didn't seem like a bad strategy for the Japanese dynamo who had 24 career knockouts coming into the bout.
But Berchelt's defence was too strong and his plan to land a mixture of head and body shots allowed him to score ample points with the judges.
Miura took the fight to Berchelt (32-1, 28 KOs) in the seventh round as the Mexican appeared to tire, pawing at him instead of landing solid blows like earlier in the bout.
Berchelt also had to deal the non-stop attack of Miura, who wouldn't yield an inch, despite taking a massive amount of punishment to the head and body.
Berchelt wobbled Miura in the eighth with a left hook but he couldn't finish him off.
Miura showed he has a steel chin and still had an opportunity to win the fight heading into the 11th round but only if he could score a knockout against Berchelt, who was in excellent condition.
Asked if he was interested in a fight with the top fighter in the division, Vasyl Lomachenko, Berchelt said yes.
I beat Vargas, I beat Miura. I am ready to fight the best, he said.

Burning of polythene, plastics in open places to be banned
The burning of polythene and plastics in open places will be banned shortly, Central Environmental Authority (CEA) Chairman Prof Lal Mervin Dharmasiri said.
He said the decision was taken considering the serious health and environmental hazards of burning polythene and plastics.
Many people who are used to home burning of polythene and plastic waste are not aware as to how harmful this practice is.
Health studies have confirmed that the toxic emissions released when burning polythene and plastics cause cancer and respiratory ailments, he pointed out.
Prof.Dharmasiri said banning the burning of polythene and plastics in open places or within the premises has been included in to the Action Plan for proper management of the use of polythene prepared by the CEA with the consultation of an expert committee.
Following Cabinet approval for the Action Plan, the Government last week announced a blanket ban on shopping bags,lunch sheets and regifoam lunch boxes from September 1.
The CEA has also recommended the Government to impose 15 percent CESS during importation of plastic raw material and related products and provide 5 percent out of that to the CEA to manage polythene and plastic waste. It has further proposed to totally ban the importation of recycled plastic raw material.
It has recommended giving tax concessions for the machinery for recycling of plastic waste and for biodegradable raw materials and manufacturing machinery.

From chaos to (mostly) Organized
Monday! I bet everything around you in the house is clean and tidy today, (depending on how many chores you achieved over the weekend). But what's the bet things won't be looking this good tomorrow and by Wednesday the doors of your closet can no longer be closed as the shelves are crammed with clothes and you haven't done the laundry. There is a growing stack of newspapers on the dining table, a wet umbrella by the door, a pile of clothes on the spare bed. By Friday, the house is a full-blown disaster zonethat is, until you tackle the massive (and much-needed) tidying up job on Saturday which will spill over to Sunday. Then, the cycle starts all over again.
I know, for many years now you might have been struggling to keep your house comfortable and lived in without it looking like wild animals live there, and perhaps like me, you could never get it right. After all, when you are busy cleaning up one room, the others in the house (dogs included) are busy creating a cyclone in another room. And then a visitor drops by and you mumble a quick sorry about the mess, as they step over toys and push a load of books off the chair to sit down.
The scary thing is having a tidy home isnt about impressing people. It can actually affect our happiness. The science of neuroarchitecture shows that our home affects our moods and if we are feeling a little down or overwhelmed, a bit of tidying might just give us the lift we need. Then again who wants to spend all their time cleaning That would surely be the perfect idea of hell. There are too many books in the world waiting to be read to be wasting time folding clothes!
The good news is by keeping up with a few good habits every single day and getting the whole family involved, you can transform your home from chaos to mostly organized. Sure, you will still have some toys on the floor during the day and general cleaning that needs to be done once a week or whenever you get to it, but for the most part, your home will be fairly neat. Lets just say that if someone gave you 15 minutes notice that they were coming over, your house would look clean.
Spacious and fresh
Experts say the number one most important thing you can do to keep your house tidy and yourself sane (and save money) is to get rid of the clutter and, just as important, stop bringing new clutter into your home. When we think about it we realize part of the reason we spend so much time tidying is because we have so much stuff to tidy. Remove some of that stuff and not only have you cut your workload, your house now looks tidy, spacious and fresh.
It's also important to stick to the adage; A place for everything and everything in its place. Most of the time our house is in a mess because we dont know what to do with the things we have or where to put it. Or we have run out of room to put it anywhere. So, After getting rid of the clutter, the next step is to find a home for everything that remains. When everything we own has a home, it takes minutes to pick things up and put them away.
We can also cultivate the habit of tidying a little, more often. Rather than having a big clean up every week or going into a panic when visitors call, take a minute or two to tidy just a little each day.
This can be as simple as putting the junk mail straight into the recycling bin rather than letting it pile up on the dining table, or washing your mug after drinking tea straight away rather than leaving it lying around. With only a second or two of effort, your house remains spic and span.
Academic success
Here's another sure-fire way of keeping your house neat. Train your tribe. What is one of the most important things you can do to help your kids grow into successful adults A writer in a magazine for housewives once asked. Is it private school Is it extra-curricular activities Well, according to research its giving them chores at a young age.
Children who began chores at ages 3 and 4 were more likely to have good relationships, achieve academic success and be self-sufficient than those who started as teens or had none at all.
A childs very first chore it appears should be (at around 2-3 with your help) to pick up their own toys. And this is also the time to capitalize on that youthful enthusiasm that wears thin as they grow older. Id love to scrub the sink, Amma! turns into a groan in a few quick years, so get in early and teach them young. True, it can be a whole chore in itself to get your kids to do their chores, and sometimes its easier to just do it yourself. In the short term. In the long term, however, nobody wins if we become a slave to our kids.
Finally, be happy with clean enough. If you are a perfectionist, this is probably the hardest one for you. You want your house to be relatively clean and tidy but that doesnt mean that every little thing has to be perfect. You can follow the 80/20 rule  meaning that you are happy with 80% of the cleaning being done. Getting caught up in all of the little details that make up the last 20% (like making sure every little speck is cleaned up off the floor or getting to all of those little out of the way and hard to reach places to dust) take up too much time and are probably details that no one would really notice. It's not that they never need to be cleaned, but make them part of a deep cleaning routine rather than your regular weekly cleaning schedule.
And at the end of the day, make it a routine to do a family 15 minute nightly clean-up. Kids can clean their rooms or do other small household chores while you and your spouse finish up the kitchen cleaning or fold and put away laundry.
Start with the things that are making the biggest mess or creating a lot of clutter or any must dos that need to be done before bed so that in the morning you wake up to a tidy house. This may look like a lot of time invested, but its really not. If everyone works together, you can have it knocked out in no time. The secret is to never aim for perfection. Just stick to a few good routines that will give you some sanity. After all we live in homes, not hotels. So find sometime to make a cup of tea, grab that book and put your feet up.

IS THERE NO MaNeKA GANDHI IN OUR PARLIAMENT
Not enough the inhuman cruelty inflicted on the desperate innocent animals in captivity at the zoo, there is an absurd move to extend evening hours to visitors. This crazy idea should stop with immediate effect. On the contrary, the animals should be given more resting hours from the evening. They should be given a days rest and make six-days a week for visitors. They have feelings and wish solitude away from camera shoots, some kids teasing and many irresponsible young and not so young. They do not need tit-bits from visitors only love and compassion that the Buddha preached to all his followers in this hallowed country.
Take a look at those chained elephants that go through the pressure of mind and body for the rest of their lives. They must be freed, rehabilitated and sent to Yala or Wilpattu.
Take a constructive example from our neighbour, India and close down all zoos and animals in captivity with no elephant rides for visitors initiated by her Environmental Minister, Maneka Gandhi. They who are born free, live free.

Cow girl
Hannah Simpson jumps over large logs on the back of a dairy cow.
Why ride a horse when you can ride a cow the dairy farmer asks on Facebook, where people have started noticing her unlikely pastime.
Now 18, Hannah, from an Invercargill farm on New Zealands South Island, has been riding her heifer for years.
On her eleventh birthday, the Kiwi was told that a pony or horse would be too expensive. She was dared by her brother to try riding Lilac instead  and their relationship blossomed.
Hannah says the Swiss Brown breed is her best friend. She shares proud selfies. Hannah is, absolutely, a cow girl.
Leila was only six months then and I was just a midget, Hannah told Eleanor Ainge Roy in New Zealand.
It was a dare from my brother to jump on and she seemed OK with it so we kept going. Before then Id only ridden a pony twice, and a sheep.
These days, Hannah and Lilac are a daily sight in the area. Hannah has taught her cow to jump, and although the heifer isnt quite as precise or sophisticated as a horse, its more than capable.
When shes in the mood, Lilac is apparently able to scale obstacles up to 1.4 metres high.
Hannah added: She is a cow and I cant expect her to ride like a horse. Without a bit of prodding she wouldnt really do anything, she has a very chilled-out nature.
Hannah works on a dairy farm in nearby Southland. She said her cow doesnt enjoy cantering around the place or running up and down hills, but prefers gentle strolls through the bush, and gentle river swims. But Lilac also loves jumping on occasion.
Lilac was always jumping out of the cow shed when she was young so I think she likes it, too, Hannah explained.
We started her off with stepping over logs and it just got bigger and bigger. A horse saddle is a step too far for Lilac. Hannah rides bareback with a halter  shes been bucked off a fair few times. But Lilac is, on the whole, a faithful, triumphant steed.
Despite the rarity of Hannah and Lilacs bond, the duo have only shot to fame in recent weeks. Its thanks to a video of Hannah cow jumping that was posted on a New Zealand farmers Facebook page. Her Instagram is gaining traction. Rightly so. She should milk her new-found fame.
Hannah doesnt enter competitions with Leila, but shes soon to be featured on local television.
Interestingly, Hannah actually got a horse two years ago. Shes called Sammy. But the farmer says she prefers to ride her trusty cow. They grew up together, after all.
Shes special, Hannah said. Mirror

Defence against dengue
Around 90,000 dengue patients and around 270 dengue deaths had been reported from all parts of Sri Lanka. This time it is Type II of dengue which has more complications than the other three types of dengue. Therefore the leading dengue experts in the country have come to the fore to educate the public on how to keep safe from dengue.
The Consultant epidemiologist attached to the Epidemiology Unit of the Health Ministry Dr Samitha Ginige:
The persons who suffered from dengue fever and get cured should take adequate rest. Otherwise, they will face various difficulties. The duration of the rest depends on the persons condition and how she or he feels. The recovered persons should not start their normal routine until they feel normal and energetic. Especially the children should take adequate rest until they feel normal and energetic. The parents should not force the recovered children to attend sports, tuition classes etc if the children do not feel energetic.
When a person develops fever, he or she should seek medical advice immediately without getting delayed. The majority of dengue patients died due to the delay of seeking medical advice. It is very important to seek prompt medical advice for any type of fever from a qualified doctor or a hospital.
The National Coordinator of the National Dengue Control Programme Dr Hasitha Tissera:
For patients infected with the dengue virus, the incubation period for some persons can be around 15 days while some others show symptoms within three or four days. Some do not show any symptoms at all and some show symptoms such as fever. Some others show symptoms such as Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF). The current dengue outbreak is Type II which has a severe impact on dengue patients than other three types. All the people should pay special attention to prevent mosquito bites and entering mosquitoes into their homes, offices, schools etc.
The people can protect themselves from mosquito bites by wearing long sleeves / fully covered dresses during the day time, applying mosquito repellents (the mosquito repellent should be applied on the skin and repeat applying after few hours.
The most popular mosquito repellent is Citronella oil. It can be applied by mixing with 50 percent of coconut oil or something similar in order to reduce its mild burning sensation. Adults can apply both natural and artificial mosquito repellents. Mosquito repellents are not suitable for the infants below two years. Natural mosquito repellents should be used for the children between two and five years).
The mosquito nets should be used while sleeping both day and night. House screening (windows and doors) to prevent entry of mosquitoes, keeping bedrooms, kitchen and toilets well-lit, ventilated and airy to prevent hiding of adult female mosquitoes inside houses,
The Clinical Head of the Centre for Clinical Management of Dengue and Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever, Negombo, Dr Lakkumara Fernando:
Using mosquito repellents is very important to prevent dengue. The mosquitoes get infected with the dengue virus by biting dengue patients. When people get infected with one type of dengue virus, they can have life long immunity against that specific type. But unfortunately, this `immunity is not similar to the immunity people get when they suffer from chickenpox or measles.
The other important issue is they can get infected with other three types of dengue at any moment. If a person has the dengue virus inside his body even without any visible symptoms (fever or anything), he or she can infect mosquitoes and when that mosquito bites a healthy person, he or she gets dengue. In few days, the dengue virus grows rapidly and into a strong position inside the bodies of dengue mosquitoes.
The dengue patients should understand that a person or a substance (may be the juice of papaya leaves) gets the credit when the dengue patients platelets count goes up naturally when the body responds to the virus naturally. Therefore however much a dengue patient takes a certain substance or not, his/her platelets count goes up naturally when the right time comes.
Consultant Physician, Infectious Diseases Hospital and well known Dengue Specialist Dr Ananda Wijewickrama:
Seek medical advice for fever as soon as possible. The people should suspect that they suffer from dengue even when their family members suffer from a normal viral flu. Full Blood Count should be tested in 48 hours and even the result is normal, the test should be repeated in another 24 hours.
The fever patients should not ignore fever even the fever goes down in a day or two. They must do the blood tests after the fever goes down. The blood report should be forwarded to a doctor as soon as possible after obtaining it from the hospital or the laboratory.
No one needs to get admitted to a hospital immediately after becoming positive for the dengue virus (NS1). But he or she needs to follow certain pieces of advice strictly. They should not take any other medication except Paracetamol. They need a full rest.
There is no impact on the dengue patient when the platelets count goes down. Therefore nothing should be done to increase the low platelets count. It goes up naturally by the seventh day of fever no matter what we eat or drink. What needs to be focused on is the pulse rate, blood pressure, urine output, breathing, and the result of the blood test called PCV. The problem is not the low platelets count. It is haemorrhage and plasma leakage. Treatment is required only for the dengue patients who develop severe complications.

Dengue, garbage problems in dire straits
Lack of political authority to the Municipal Councils is the main reason for the aggravation of the dengue and garbage problems, Megapolis nad Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawka said.
He was addressing a meeting held at the Ministry recently.
He said people's representatives are needed to combat the dengue epidemic and the garbage problem. "Therefore, elections should be held for all the 338 local councils to elect people's representatives either on the old or the new election system. We request all political parties to desist from obstructing local elections by complicating the issue any more," the Minister said.
Minister Ranawaka said local elections should not be considered as a tool to measure political strength of various parties because holding elections was a dire necessity to serve the people. He said the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime adopted a LG election law mixing the proportional representative and first past the post systems.
"Under the new system, 70 percent of representatives are elected via the ward system, while the balance 30 percent on the proportional system. But the demarcation of the wards was not done systematically. Former minister Basil Rajapaksa, as everyone knows, intervened and demarcated wards to make them advantageous to his party," he said.

With a dignified flavour!
Friday July 15 was World Youth Skills Day, which the United Nations observed with a special event on the theme of Skills Development to Improve Youth Employment. Understanding what works to support young people in todays and tomorrows labour market through training and skills development will be key to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda, and will be at the centre of this high-level event.
A key element
Young people are almost three times more likely to be unemployed than adults and continuously exposed to lower quality of jobs, greater labour market inequalities and longer and more insecure school-to-work transitions. In addition, women are more likely to be underemployed and under-paid, and to undertake part-time jobs or work under temporary contracts.
That is why education and skills training are key determinants of success in the labour market. But unfortunately, existing systems are failing to address the learning needs of many young people and surveys of learning outcomes and skills show that a large number of youth have low levels of achievement in basic literacy and numeracy.
According to a recent International Labour Organization (ILO) publication, 73.4 million young people were estimated to be unemployed in 2015 and this figure is expected to increase in most regions by 2017. One reason for youth unemployment is structural unemployment, a mismatch between the skills that workers in the economy can offer and the skills demanded of workers by employers.
Much has been written on the importance of skills regarding the requirements of the current and future labour market. Trend reports, vocational guides the search for a job and/or the development of ones professional career necessarily include improving skills and abilities as a key element in personal branding.
The human capital
Following the recognition in 2014 by the UN many international and regional organisations, will assist in raising awareness on promoting skills as a means to address the challenges of unemployment and under employment. There are more youth on the planet than ever before. These young people are poised with all of the potential and energy to be our next generation of leaders, workers and parents. Fostering the acquisition of skills by youth will enhance their ability to make informed choices with regard to life and work and empower them to gain access to changing labour markets and viable employment opportunities.
While many of todays youth inhabit a world of unlimited opportunity and possibility, millions more are being left out. Globally, the youth unemployment rate is almost three times higher than the rate for adults. Basically speaking these youth are stuck  left at a crossroads with little opportunity to reach their full potential due to a lack of employment opportunities and a lack of education and basic skills. Unfortunately, with few choices, many youth are vulnerable to a life of poverty or violence.
There is also a need to internalise the realisation that vocational and technical training is as important as tertiary education. The dynamics of the global economy and the needs of companies, have led to increased demand for professionals with specific expertise and skills that are not necessarily available at traditional universities. Many industries and fields are looking for people with specific skills to solve problems in a practical, simple and pragmatic manner.
Everyone appears to be focusing on building on the assets we hold within our own small universe. These include property, machinery, markets and raw materials among other resources, which are all acquirable through artificial sources. Everyone is quick to concentrate on this capital. But if we aim to accomplish any real progress it is imperative that we focus our attention on the human capital, which is the most vital component for the success of any venture.
But we now have to find a flow of human capital into every one of our local development sectors over a given period of time. But because of various constricting factors, not the least among them the senseless civil war, the availability of this human capital had been eroding day by day. The focus must also be on training youth in basic hands-on skills which include masonry, carpentry, welding and plumbing among other such vital occupations.
Social welfare activities
Long before World Youth Skills Day was inaugurated there were eminent trailblazing legends in our own nation who left behind a legacy of addressing such burning issues. I am referring to people such as the late Lorna Wright, a free-lance woman journalist, broadcaster and social worker who assisted the marginalized to embark on small scale and viable economic ventures. She emphasized the need to identify and harness the innate talents and skills of the rural and suburban poor and the need to work within the cultural, economic and social constraints of their environment.
Lorna Wright deplored the fact that for thousands of youth the chances of participating in the development of the nation had been lost because of the lack of opportunities to further their educational skills and also because of the woeful system of our education. Wright was quick to highlight the heartbreak of these underprivileged youth who had received little or no formal education or opportunities that were essential to enter a dignified occupation and enjoy a reasonably satisfying livelihood.
She always demonstrated an enthusiastic interest in both womens and youth affairs by providing them with guidance and opportunities to break out of their poverty-stricken world. She was resolute in offering them the necessary skills and determination to step into a brighter future. Wright came up with the innovative concept of the Ath-Udauwwa programme with the focus on training youth in basic hands-on skills which included masonry, carpentry, welding and plumbing among other such occupations. As an incentive to instil in them the dignity of honest labour they were provided with certificates and uniforms as a mark of prestige (thathweya).
Wright possessed Australian citizenship, but was granted a permanent resident visa for Sri Lanka by the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa. And so she returned to become the recipient of several international awards including the SAARC Awards for Women of Excellence and the Zonta Award. In 2004 she was conferred the Order of Australia, the countrys highest honour in the Queens Birthday Honours list. The award was bestowed on her in recognition of her service to international relations through social welfare activities in Sri Lanka particularly through the Memory of Mother Foundation (MOM). She deservingly received international awards in recognition of her noble activities, but lamentably in the land of her birth Lorna Wright remains without any official state acknowledgement. Yet at her funeral one witnessed long lines of people waiting to express their condolences and among them the tear-streaked faces of hundreds of mourners.
Wright was aware that there was for her a special place in the hearts of the thousands of people whose lives she had touched in a meaningful way by her gracious patronage. They paid the founder of MOM the greatest tribute by conferring her with the matchless and most reverential title of them all. They called her Amma.

Regular cutting of the lawn is important because it thickens the grass. Regarding the cutting technique: Little and often is better than all in one go. Switch directions and patterns each time you mow, so that the grass blades arent pressed in the same direction every time. For each cut, the rule of thumb is to shorten the grass by around half to two-thirds to approximately 5 centimetres. In the middle of the summer, you might want to keep the grass a little longer, as it withstands periods of drought better.
2. Fertilising
Cutting the grass removes nutrients from the grass, nutrients that have to be replaced in order to achieve healthy growth. So, from the beginning of spring, you should fertilise the lawn every four or five weeks. Nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous are necessary and mixes of special lawn fertilisers are readily available at your local garden retailer. How much to use is carefully indicated on the packages.
3. Watering
If you want a lawn that is lush and green all summer, watering is important. How often you need to water your lawn depends on temperature and humidity. When the grass needs water, it will begin to take on a blue-gray tint, and the older grass blades on the lawn will begin to curl up or wilt. If you have planted a new lawn, you will usually need to water once a day so the seeds can germinate and a good solid root system can form. Nowadays the watering of the lawn can be achieved with a minimum of hassle. You can water
your garden by hand, partially or fully automatically. GARDENAs product range comprises of mobile and stationary watering solutions as well as pumps and watering controls. If you like, computer controlled, intelligent, automated systems and sprinklers can take care of the work and all you have to think about is programming and placing the sprinklers.
4. Weed Control
With persistence and using the right technique the battle against weeds in your lawn might actually be won. A lot of weeds can be removed using mechanical means. Smaller weeds (veronicas or white clover) should be removed with a manual scarifier, used often in order to disturb them and preventing growth. Daisies and dandelions should be removed with a root weeder and its very important to get as much of the root as possible in order to prevent the regrowth. If you  against all odds  are overcome, you have to consider herbicides. In a scenario where the weeds have overcome the grass, the re-structuring of the entire soil and covering it with rolled turf is the best solution.
5. Scarifying and aerification
The grass roots need air in order to be able to breathe and grow. The soil of a lawn is often not sandy enough for the roots to get enough air resulting in stunted growth. With the help of a simple digging fork you can stamp holes into the lawn and fill them with coarse sand. This allows water from the surface to flow away and also provides the roots with oxygen. In order to clear away dead roots and other debris you might want to scarify your lawn. By removing the lawn thatch you provide more breathing space for the lower parts of the grass and help the stems grow better

Economic growth surpassed Govts modest expectation: PM
The country has achieved an admirable economic growth rate of 4.7 percent surpassing the governments modest expectation of 3 to 3.5 percent in the wake of natural disasters and a heavy debt trap, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
This gives us hopes of the growth rate reaching 5 percent soon, the PM said.
The Prime Minister made this observation presiding over a meeting at the Neluwa Divisional Secretariat to review the progress of disaster relief activities in the Galle district on July 14.
Premier Wickremesinghe said the government was tasked with the responsibility of developing the economy while facing challenges posed by the recent disaster situation.
When the government assumed power it was not in a position to even pay the interest due on massive foreign loans obtained by the previous regime. The foreign debt and interest repayable during the next three years would account to nearly one trillion rupees. Almost 35 to 36 percent of the GDP had to be set aside annually to repay these loans and interest, the Prime Minister said.
The Governments objective was to increase income without getting into further debt to service loans. Today, the repayment of interest on foreign loans is not a problem due to the sound economic management introduced by the government. The country would receive massive investments once large scale development programmes are launched in the near future, the PM said.
The country would be able to gain foreign investment to the tune of 7 billion US dollars in the next three years. That could even be increased to 8 or 9 billion US dollars subsequently. When that money is invested, it would help increase export earnings to facilitate the resolution of the Balance of Payments problem and the countrys forward march, the Premier said.
The government hoped to bring about an equilibrium by 2020 and thereby enable the country to repay debts through the strengthening of the economy,the Premier said.
Although certain places in the devastated areas had received relief funds, there had been shortcomings in respect of certain other places. The prime objective of the government was to restore community life within a short period, the Premier said.
He said the progress of relief work in Galle district was at a satisfactory level.
Normally when a disaster occurred, the relief work which showed progress in the first month seemed to lag behind during subsequent months, the PM said.
This time, this situation did not crop up because the President and the Prime Minister had been constantly visiting the affected areas to review the progress of work, the Prime Minister added.

Erdogan warns traitors on coup defeat anniversary
ISTANBUL: Turkey on Saturday marked one year since the defeat of the failed coup bid with mass nationwide rallies seeking to showcase national unity and a stern warning by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to chop off the heads of traitors. The authorities declared July 15 an annual national holiday of democracy and unity, billing the foiling of the putsch as a historic victory of Turkish democracy.
In an intense programme aiming to hammer home the anniversarys importance, Erdogan attended a special session of parliament in Ankara, spoke to a mass rally in Istanbul and then flew back to the capital for a rally outside parliament and a special event at the presidential palace in the early hours of the morning.
Speaking to hundreds of thousands by the bridge across the Bosphorus in Istanbul that was a fighting flashpoint, Erdogan warned Turkey could reintroduce capital punishment.
First of all we will chop off the heads of those traitors, Erdogan said, reaffirming he would sign any passed by parliament bill on resuming executions.
Any move to restore capital punishment -- which Turkey abolished in 2004 -- would effectively end Ankaras European Union membership ambitions.
Erdogan also said the suspects being tried over the failed coup should wear uniform clothing like the notorious orange jumpsuits used at US military prison at Guantanamo Bay.
When they appear in court, lets make them appear in uniform suits like in Guantanamo, Erdogan said to cheers.
Supporters chanted we are soldiers of Tayyip (Erdogan), with some even brandishing nooses in a symbol of their support for the death penalty.
In the later speech to thousands outside parliament in Ankara which was bombed by warplanes that night, Erdogan declaimed our nation showed the whole world what a nation we are on July 15. The crowds later made their way to the palace where dozens had camped outside for the final official event during which Erdogan inaugurated a monument to the victims which has people hold up the crescent and star symbols of the Turkish flag.
Two hundred and forty nine people, not including the plotters, were killed when a disgruntled faction of the army sent tanks into the streets and war planes into the sky in a bid to overthrow Erdogan after one-and-a-half decades in power.
But they were thwarted within hours as the authorities regrouped and people poured into the streets in support of Erdogan, who blamed followers of his ally-turned-nemesis, the US-based preacher Fethullah Gulen.
Did my citizens have weapons They had their flags like today but they had a more efficient weapon: their faith, Erdogan said in Istanbul.
Murat, an Erdogan supporter at the Ankara rally, said: If that happened once more, I would stay out again. That night, it was like a war. We take ownership of this country and this people. In the wake of the failed coup bid, authorities embarked on the biggest purge in Turkeys history, arresting 50,000 people and sacking almost three times as many. Erdogan also shored up his position by winning a referendum on enhancing his powers earlier this year.
In the latest dismissals, another 7,563 police, soldiers and other state employees were fired late Friday under the state of emergency that has been in place since July 20 last year.
Erdogan said a decision would be made on Monday over whether to recommend extending the emergency by another three months.
Turkeys opposition had put political disputes aside on the night of the putsch but the scale of the purge has intensified political divisions.
The celebrations come less than a week after the head of the Republican Peoples Party (CHP) Kemal Kilicdaroglu held the largest opposition rally in Turkey in years, pushing for justice in a move that irked Erdogan.
Over the last year, the judicial proceedings... moved outside the framework of the law, Kilicdaroglu told the special session of parliament.
He also called for full clarity over what happened on the night of July 15, with questions still remaining over when the authorities first found out an uprising was afoot.
But Erdogan angrily slammed as an immorality opposition claims of a controlled coup which the authorities had known about in advance and then taken advantage of.
Gulen has always denied involvement and in a new statement Friday said the accusations were baseless, politically motivated slanders and slammed a witch hunt of Erdogans critics.
The scale of Saturdays nationwide commemorations is aimed at etching July 15, 2016 into the minds of Turks as a key date in the history of the modern state.
Giant posters designed by the presidency have sprung up across billboards in Istanbul and Ankara showing gaudy paintings that portray the key events of the coup night with the slogan the epic of July 15.
Illuminated anti-coup slogans were hung between the minarets of some of Istanbuls greatest Ottoman mosques.
Meanwhile mobile phone users in Turkey were surprised to hear a voice message by Erdogan himself when placing a call, congratulating them on the defeat of the coup. - AFP

Extortion, the main motive: Police Media Spokesman
The purpose of enforced disappearance of 11 youth in 2008 was to extort money and none of them had been involved in any terrorist activity, Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
Speaking to the media at the Government Information Department yesterday, he said the arrest of former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P. Dassanayake was based on strong and clear evidence of his involvement in the disappearance of 11 youth.
The Police Media Spokesman said the reports obtained from the Tri-Forces, Police and intelligence services confirmed that none of the disappeared youth were involved in any terrorist activity.
A few officers in the Navy had committed those disappearances by acting wantonly and abusing their powers. Nobody can fault the Navy for those acts, he said.
Gunasekara, detailing the investigations on the disappearance of 11 youth, said the Police have so far arrested seven Navy officers in connection with the disappearances, including the first accused Sampath Munasinghe, who has been released on bail.
He said the 11 missing persons, on whom investigations were nearing completion, were residents of Mannar, Kotahena, Trincomalee, Grandpass, Maradana, Dehiwala and Dematagoda. He said the CID investigations could reveal that those youth had been detained at two locations, namely at Chaithya Road in Colombo and the Navy Camp in Trincomalee.
He said the CID has received 28 complaints with regard to enforced disappearances in 2008, adding that the rest of the complaints would also be investigated and the offenders would be brought to book.
The investigations on disappearances of youth in 2008 commenced following a written complaint by former Navy Commander Admiral Wasantha Karannagoda to the Colombo Crimes Division on May 28, 2009. The investigations were handed over to the CID on June 10, 2009. The CID has obtained statements from missing persons families and naval officers, and scientific evidence based on analysis reports of phone calls.

Federer wins record 8th Wimbledon as Cilic bid ends in tears
London: Roger Federer won a record eighth Wimbledon title and became the tournaments oldest champion Sunday with a straight-sets victory over injury-hit Marin Cilic who dramatically broke down in tears midway through the final.
Federer claimed his 19th Grand Slam title 6-3, 6-1, 6-4 and at 35 is Wimbledons oldest mens winner of the modern era, succeeding Arthur Ashe, who was almost 32 when he won in 1976.
However, the Swiss superstars 11th Wimbledon final, and 29th at the majors, will also be remembered for the moving sight of the popular Cilic breaking down in tears after slipping 3-0 behind in the second set.
The seventh seeded Croatian, the 2014 US Open champion, sobbed inconsolably and buried his head in his towel as his title dream slipped away.
He had his left foot taped at the end of the second set but it was in vain as Federer became the first player since Bjorn Borg in 1976 to win Wimbledon without dropping a set in the entire tournament.
Hes a hero, Federer said of his opponent.
Twelve months ago, Federer was defeated in five sets in the semi-finals by Milos Raonic and promptly shut down his season to rest a knee injury.
Its disbelief I can achieve such heights. I wasnt sure I would ever be here in another final after last year, said Federer, who turns 36 in three weeks time and who has now broken the tie for seven Wimbledon titles he shared with Pete Sampras and William Renshaw.
I had some tough ones in the finals, losing two against Novak (Djokovic).
But I always believed. I kept on believing and dreaming I could get back.
Here am I today with the eighth. Its fantastic, if you keep believing you can go far in your life.
Federer won his 18th Slam in Australia in January on his return to the tour before adding the Indian Wells and Miami Masters back-to-back and a ninth Halle grasscourt title.
He also skipped the entire claycourt season.
Ive got to take more time off, joked Federer, playing in just his seventh event of the year.
Ill be gone again for the next six months! I dont know if it will work as well again.
Cilic, who had spent four and a half hours more than Federer getting to the final, said retiring with his injury was never an option.
I never give up in a match. I gave it my best -- its all I can do, said Cilic who was still emotional at the trophy presentation.
I had an amazing journey here. I played the best tennis of my life. I really want to thank my team -- they gave so much strength to me.
Beneath a star-studded Royal Box where Prince William and wife Kate rubbed shoulders with actors Hugh Grant and Bradley Cooper, Cilic had his first break point in the fourth game.
It was saved by Federer and it was to be Cilics only glimmer of hope.
Federer broke in the next game when his opponent suffered a nasty fall on the worn surface which was to ultimately undermine his challenge.
Federer then served up two love service games before claiming the opener 6-3 off a Cilic double fault, the Croatians second of the final.
The Swiss superstar swept into a 3-0 lead in the second set and at the changeover, Cilic slumped in his courtside chair in tears and in obvious pain. The trainer and doctor were summoned before Cilic hid his head in his towel in a desperate attempt to compose himself.
The 28-year-old held serve on the resumption but the lethal barrage continued, Federer stretching his lead over his friend to 4-1.
Cilic dropped the set 6-1 and called a medical timeout to have his left foot bandaged and take a painkiller.
His discomfort was reflected in his statistics.
By the end of the second set, he had served just two aces compared to the 130 he had fired past bamboozled opponents in his previous six rounds.
Federer pounced again with a break for 4-3 and wrapped up the one-sided final with a second serve ace to complete his coronation after just 1hr 41 minutes.
Fittingly, he too wept at the end. AFP

Fresh vistas of SRI Lankan Foreign Policy
The policy of the present government of Sri Lanka has been guided by the principle of non-alignment which requires Sri Lanka to maintain equally close relations with the two big regional powers, India and China. Sri Lanka seeks to obtain their support for the promotion of trade and investments aimed at accelerating economic growth rate while providing employment to the unemployed youth and eradication of poverty. Sri Lanka is, in a way, very fortunate that both India and China have shown a very keen interest in integrating Sri Lankas economic development to their respective economic development plans for the region.
The Sri Lankan governments foreign policy perspective appears to be exploring the possibility of obtaining the support of other economic powers outside the region such as the European Economic Union, Japan and Australia also for her development projects. The Sri Lankan government has been able to sign a large number of agreements with these economic powers recently for promoting trade with these states and inducing investors of these countries to invest in Sri Lanka.
In this article, I am attempting to draw the attention of the reader to a serious problem that Sri Lanka is confronted with in maintaining an equally close relationship with the two regional powers, India and China, because these regional powers have conflicting regional and global interests.
Foreign policy of the previous regime
It can be said that the foreign policy adopted by the Rajapaksa regime during the last stage of administration was irrational. The government adopted a confrontationist attitude when the members of the international community brought before the UNO some issues of human rights violations during the last stage of the war.
This attitude of the Sri Lankan government resulted in many powerful states including India showing reluctance to contribute in a substantial way for implementing the development projects designed for rapid economic growth. Only China, the fastest growing economy, at the time, was willing to assist Sri Lanka by undertaking to grant financial assistance for the massive development projects such as the Hambantota port, Mattala airport and the Port City in Colombo.
The Chinese government agreed to provide finance for the implementation of these projects. However, it is after the completion of the construction work of the Hambanthota port and the Mattala airport that the Sri Lankan government realised that these projects were economically not viable and the burden of paying foreign debts became a very serious economic problem for the government.
After the change of government in 2015, the new government had suspended the construction work in the Port City, stating as a reason, the need for making a proper study of the agreement with the Chinese construction company and if necessary to make amendments to the agreement. Consequently, after several months, the Sri Lankan government permitted the Chinese construction company to go ahead with the construction of the Port City after making some amendments to the agreement. However, after taking into consideration the loss and damage caused to the Chinese company during the time that the construction work had been suspended, the Sri Lankan government undertook to pay compensation to the construction company in some form.
The new government had no alternative but to seek the cooperation of China for making the running of the Hambanthota port an economically viable enterprise by signing necessary agreements for sharing the management of the port with the Chinese Company, China Merchant Port Holdings Company Ltd. Although a Concession Agreement and a Framework Agreement have been drafted, the Sri Lankan government seeks to amend some provisions to make the terms more favourable to Sri Lanka.
Opposition to Chinas involvement in development projects
Even before the change of government, there was opposition to the involvement of China in the strategically important development projects such as sea ports and airports and granting management and control over such projects after the completion of the construction work. The critics of the Chinas involvement in such projects pointed out that when China acquires an ability to have control over such assets in Sri Lanka for long periods, it results in the erosion of Sri Lankas sovereignty. Moreover, China is viewed as a rival state by India and India entertained the fear that in the event of a dispute between these two states escalating to the state of a military confrontation, there is a possibility of the assets such as sea ports under its control and management being used by China for military purposes.
It cannot be said that the Sri Lankan government was not aware of the fact that China had designed a plan for constructing sea ports in strategically important locations in the littoral states of the Indian Ocean and several sea ports such as the port at Gwadar on the southern coast of Pakistan and Sittwe in Myanmar had already been constructed. It was viewed that these sea ports constructed by China were aimed at containing India which was considered as a rival state due to several inter-state issues between these two rising powers in Asia. India too had engaged in constructing new sea ports in the eastern coast of India with a view to expanding its maritime interests and preserving its dominance in the Indian Ocean.
Chinas One Belt One Road global project
China, being a rising power with the vision of reaching the super power status has already assumed a world power status posing a challenge to the USA and also India. For reaching the super power status, China has to use its diplomacy for expanding its spheres of influence for finding markets, resources and assets for investments in other countries, not only in the region but also in other parts of the world.
The concept of ancient Silk Road has been redefined as the One Belt One Road Initiative (OBOR). It is a massive infrastructure project financed by China to link the country with Africa, Asia and Europe through a network of ports, railways and industrial parks. However, this connectivity and development projects of China are viewed by other economic powers with suspicion. It is viewed as an attempt to attract economically weak countries seeking foreign aid for development, to Chinas sphere of influence undermining the status enjoyed by other economic powers in Asia and in regions outside Asia.
India cooperating with Japan for a counter-project
Newspapers reported recently that India has sought the support of Japan for acting jointly for developing an Asia-Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC) as a counter to Chinas ambitious One Belt One Road also known as the New Silk Road project. The Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, made reference to this while addressing the 52nd Annual General Meeting of the African Development Bank (ADB) at Gandhinagar, Gujarats capital, on May 23.
The proposed project is largely meant to propel growth and investment in Africa by curtailing the ever increasing presence of the Chinese on the continent. The AAGC is an attempt to create a Free and Open Indo - Pacific Region by rediscovering ancient sea-routes and creating new sea corridors that will link the African continent with India and South East Asia. The idea is to enable economies in Asia and Africa to further integrate and collectively emerge as a globally competitive economic block.
We are aware that India has assumed a role as the leader of the South Asian region considering that the geopolitical factor of neighborhood requires the small states in South Asia such as Sri Lanka, Nepal, Maldive Islands and Bhutan to orient their relations with other states in such a manner that their policies should remain consistent with the foreign policy of India at any particular point in time.
India considers that there is an obligation on the part of neighbouring states to consult India not only in the matter of taking foreign policy decisions but also regarding internal matters if they constitute a source of a threat to Indias security. For example, a civil war or political instability in a neighbouring state can be regarded as a potential threat to Indias security.
India also considers that if a neighbouring state adopts an independent foreign policy disregarding Indias concerns or the government of a neighbouring state ignores Indias advice as to how an internal problem such as a civil war should be managed, there is an obligation on the part of India as the Big Brother to intervene. Sri Lanka has already learnt lessons regarding the consequences of disregarding Indias concerns or fears in taking not only foreign policy decisions but also ignoring Indias advice regarding some internal problems.
When we take into consideration some recently announced foreign policy decisions by two regional leaders, India and China, it appears that both these rising powers are engaged in a competition for expanding their spheres of influence both in their neighbourhood and also outside their immediate neighbourhood.
It appears that India perceives Chinas increasing involvement in the massive infrastructure development projects in neighbouring states as a threat not only to its security but also its economic interests. Indian leaders attitude is that Sri Lanka should remain exclusively within the sphere of influence of India.
According to them, for foreign aid or assistance for economic development, there is no option for Sri Lanka other than relying upon India. In explaining why Sri Lanka should remain exclusively within the sphere of influence of India, the Prime Minister of India, in addressing the audience at the 14th UN International Vesak Celebrations, stressed the cultural bond and affinity between the peoples of India and Sri Lanka which make the peoples in these two countries inseparable. He said that therefore there is a moral obligation on the part of India to support Sri Lankas economic development efforts.
The Prime Minister states that India is committed to the economic prosperity of Sri Lankas citizens because whether it is on land or in the waters of the Indian Ocean, the security of our societies is indivisible.
What he means by stating that the security of our societies is indivisible is that India opposes Sri Lanka permitting China or any other outside power to involve in economic development activities, if such outside powers involvement in strategically significant development projects poses a threat to Indias security, and as such, when Sri Lankan leaders seek the involvement of any outside power in Sri Lankas development activities, they should have Indias security concerns uppermost in their minds.
Sri Lanka seeking Indias assistance for new projects
When Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe met Prime Minister Modi in April, a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation in economic development projects was signed.
According to this Memorandum of Understanding, Sri Lanka seeks the cooperation of India for the construction of a regasified liquefied natural gas (LNG) fired power plant, an LNG terminal and floating storage regasification unit in Colombo, and a solar power plant in Sampur. Several mega-development projects such as the creation of industrial zones or special economic zones in identified locations in Sri Lanka, a project for road connectivity and railway track upgrading and also a container terminal in Colombo, have been included in the MoU.
However, the agreement between India and Sri Lanka for the development of the Oil Tank Farm, the proposed petroleum refinery and industrial zones in Trincomalee has become a controversial issue for the reason that there is a prejudice in the minds of some sections of the people in this country that India might use such facilities and assets in Sri Lanka for dominating Sri Lanka economically and also politically.
Sri Lankas policy has been not to have an exclusive reliance on India or China for her economic development projects but to have the cooperation of both countries maintaining an equally cordial relationship. But, the geopolitical factor of Sri Lankas location in the Indian Ocean close to India and Indias security concerns is a very salient factor that foreign policy decision makers in Sri Lanka should take into consideration.
Therefore, when Sri Lanka enters into agreements with other states seeking their involvement in strategically significant development projects, there should be very clear provisions in such agreements prohibiting such states from using Sri Lankan Soil, or in other words, any facilities or assets in Sri Lanka, for military purposes.

Global Ceylon Tea Party in London held in style
A large number of representatives from UK government authorities, international organizations, non-governmental bodies and private sector businesses joined the UK edition of the Global Ceylon Tea Party, which was hosted by the Sri Lanka High Commission in London recently in close collaboration with the Colombo Tea Traders Association and Sri Lanka Tea Board.
In her welcome address, the high commissioner of Sri Lanka in the UK, Amari Wijewardene highlighted the valuable role played by James Taylor, the Scottish planter, who pioneered commercial plantation of teas in the island 150 years ago and the overall contribution made by the British in the subsequent development of the tea industry.
She also placed special emphasis on the worldwide recognition gained by Ceylon teas due to their premium quality and distinctive flavors.
Sri Lankan High Commissioner to the UK addressing the guests
Addressing the gathering, Ian Gibbs, Chairman of the International Tea Committee said Sri Lanka had been an active player within the global tea industry, making a substantial contribution as a leading producer and exporter of black teas. He also said that Sri Lanka had been in the forefront as key exporter of value-added teas to the world.

Gota says he never approved dismantling of KKS cement factory
Former Defence Secretary Gotabahya Rajapaksa has stated that he never approved the dismantling of the Kankesanturai (KKS) Cement Factory and cement company and sale of its machinery and equipment as scrap iron. He had also not seen any document granting approval for it signed by him either.
Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had stated this in an affidavit submitted to the Presidential Commission Investigating Alleged Acts of Fraud or Corruption abuse of former State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC). The affidavit had been submitted against two former Senior Army officers including an Army Commander and a former high ranking state official.
The PRECIFAC is conducting investigations into an alleged fraud involving the dismantling of the Kankasanturai Cement Factory reported to be in a re-operational condition and the cement company and the sale of the machinery and equipment as scrap iron for over Rs.100 million by the Army during the previous regime.
This alleged fraud was disclosed by State Counsel Senior Attorney Janaka Bandara during submissions made before PRECIFAC about AN alleged act of fraud and corruption committed during the Rajapaksa regime from 2011 to 2015. Documents relating to this alleged fraud were found during investigations made by the Commissions. Former Additional Secretary to the Defence Ministry Siripala Hettiarachchi had made an official note at the Ministry to the effect that former Defence Secretary Gotabahaya Rajapaksa told him that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had sanctioned the sale of this stock of iron. Another note at the ministry stated that Internal Auditor R.M. Premachiandra had pointed out the need for Cabinet approval to effort the sale.
The machinery and equipment at the cement factory had been manufactured in the UK and Germany. The German machinery and equipment carried a 100 year guarantee from the manufacturers.
Investigations revealed that this stock of iron had been sold to one Siraz Mohamed and Yusuf Asthan and a retired Army officer named E.M.V. Ekanayake. A sum of Rs. 75 million had been realised as proceeds from the stock sold to Ekanayake.
It was revealed that this action had been taken by the Army in an arbitrary manner without any acquisition of the Cement Corporation premises situated in an area of 741 acres, State Council Senior Attorney Janaka Bandara making submissions made for he prosecution said. These had been made with written evidence during investigations made by Constables Herath and Wijesinghe under the supervision of Sub Inspector Herath,former Army Commander Daya Ratnayake, former Commander Jaffna Security forces Headquaers Maj.Gen.Mahinda Hathurusinghe, Maj.Gen. Udaya Annesley Perera, Additional Secretary Defence Ministry Siripala Hettarachchi, Yousuf Asthan and Siriaz Mohamed appeared as defendants before the commissions.

Growing green vegetables
1) Let there be light
 Most veggies, especially those that bear fruit (tomatoes, cucumbers, squash, and peppers, for example) need sun, and a lot of it. Ideally, you want a site with at least 8 hours of direct sun per day. In less light, you can still grow some edibles; mainly leafy crops and herbs. Check out my shady crop suggestions here.
2) Soil is everything
 Healthy, rich soil is the key to a successful and productive vegetable garden, so dont skip this step! A soil test will give you an idea of your existing soil fertility and pH, and offer suggestions of what types of fertilizers or amendments will get your plot up to par.
In my own garden, I rely on homemade compost, organic well-composted animal manures, and organic fertilizers like kelp meal and alfalfa meal.
3) Keep it small
 A vegetable garden can be low-maintenance, but its not no-maintenance. Therefore, do yourself a favour and stick to a small plot for the first year or two. A 4 by 8 foot bed is ideal for a starter veggie garden and will give you enough space to grow a handful of crops (see the next point). If you wish to start even smaller, try planting container-friendly veggies and herbs in pots or window-boxes on a sunny deck.
4) Pick yourplants
 With your first veggie garden, its very tempting to want to grow everything! But, for your own sake, Id suggest you pick 4 to 5 types of vegetables and grow them well. Trying to cram too much in a compact space is asking for trouble and youll end up with a smaller, not larger harvest.
However, you can boost yield by succession planting. When your initial crops have been harvested, follow up with a second sowing. For example, follow spring lettuce with summer beans. Succession planting allows you to stretch your harvest season for the longest possible time.
5) Bring on the blooms
 Ok, this might be hard to believe, but most bugs are your friends! Yup, its true. Think bees, butterflies, tachinid flies, ladybugs and more! To attract these good guys to your garden  and boost crop pollination  include clumps of insect-friendly plants like sweet alyssum, zinnias, cosmos, and sunflowers between the veggies and herbs.
6) Water, weed & feed
 This is a fairly obvious point, but new veggie gardeners may not know when or how much to water. Newly seeded beds will need frequent watering, but most established crops can get by on one to two inches of water per week. To conserve water and reduce the need to irrigate, mulch your soil with several inches of straw or shredded leaves. Side benefit: the mulch will also suppress weeds! As for feeding, quick growing crops like radishes and lettuce wont need supplemental fertilizers if grown in in fertile soil. Long-term veggies like tomatoes, winter squash, and eggplants, however, will appreciate a boost several times over the growing season. Give them an occasional dose of a water soluble organic food to support growth and encourage the biggest harvest.

GTF inspires diaspora to join Sri Lankas journey towards progress: Ravi
Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake said the Global Tamil Forum (GTF) inspired people of Sri Lankan origin outside Sri Lanka to undertake an important journey towards harmony, peace, prosperity in Sri Lanka with its people, and with the government through the project that they initiated to assist the disaster affected people in Sri Lanka.
He was addressing the gathering at the ceremony held on July 11 at the Foreign Affairs Ministry to felicitate the Sarvodaya Movement and the 17 Sri Lankan medical professionals who are members of the GTF from the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Norway, the United States, France, Bahrain, and Germany worked in partnership with the Sarvodaya alongside local doctors in the Kalutara district from July 2 to 6 and in the Matara district from July 7 to 10 to provide relief to the flood affected in the country.
Approximately 780 patients were provided with medical, dental and ophthalmological treatment that included a childrens home and orphanage. Three hundred pairs of reading glasses and sunglasses were gifted to people.
Minister Karunanayake appreciated the doctors for assisting the flood affected communities, while helping to build bridges between communities in Sri Lanka with the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement that has been in the forefront of social service and reconciliation efforts, working tirelessly to bring communities together.
The Minister acknowledged and appreciated the support extended to the programme by the Governments of Norway and Switzerland and by UNICEF.
He thanked Health Minister Rajitha Seneratne and officials of his Ministry for facilitating the project at short notice, enabling the doctors to carry out their work in accordance with the Medical Council regulations.
Recalling the Chinese proverb A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step, Minister Karunanayake said this important step would serve as the first in the important journey of sustaining peace and economic progress in the country together with Sri Lankans overseas.
Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M. Swaminathan, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, and MP M.A. Sumanthiran, representatives from diplomatic Missions of Australia, Canada, India, Malaysia, Norway, the UK, the US, South Africa, Switzerland, and the USAID participated.

Hayleys Advantis strengthens with new acquisition in Maldives
Hayleys Advantis has further solidified its position in the Maldives with the addition of two new landing craft that will further expand the range of services offered by their subsidiary, Total Transport Solutions Maldives (Pvt) Limited (TTS).
These landing craft will allow TTS to actively participate in discharging cargo midstream and make deliveries in shallow waters. Commenting on the latest acquisition the Chief Operating Officer of TTS, Arosha Fernando said, As a nation that relies heavily on imports, the Maldives would benefit from a sophisticated integrated logistics provider like TTS and as we expandour capabilities it is the Maldives that will reap the benefits.
The addition of these two new landing craft will also improve infrastructure development projects like the construction of resorts, thus helping the tourism industry grow.
It is forward thinking initiatives like this that have made TTS a leading logistics service provider in the Maldives.
The two landing craft are Malaysian built with a 500 ton and 325 ton cargo carrying capacity.
Each has a steel hull and twin 350 horsepower engines. Ideally suited for shallow waters these craft will give TTS access to islands with no proper jetties by allowing them to take cargo directly onto the beach thus removing a logistical hurdle that will vastly increase the options available to their customers.
These new landing craft will also help us cater to a segment that requires shallow water deliveries which will further expand our end-to-end service portfolio. The acquisition of the new landing craft was driven in part by our vision that the economic future of the Maldives is closely tied to the prosperity of the logistics industry, said Arosha Fernando.
Total Transport Solutions (Maldives) is a joint venture between Sri Lankan logistics giant Hayleys Advantis Limited and Arowana Investment (Pvt) Limited based in the Maldives.

Healthy and tasty!
Allium Tuberosum known as Chinese Chives or known as Nira in Japanese is a relatively unknown vegetable in Sri Lanka. Garden Talk speaks to Deputy Directors Office of Agriculture Ratmalana, Subject Matter Officer (Horticulture) Chitrani Menikge on Chinese Chives, a hidden but nutritious vegetable.
Nira found its way to Sri Lanka in 1971. It was introduced to Sri Lanka by the Chinese and the Japanese. It is a very popular vegetable amongst the Chinese and the Japanese. The Japanese community in Sri Lanka, cultivated this vegetable in Sri Lanka. Nira or Chinese Chives is similar to a Leeks plant. The taste of Nira/ Chinese Chives leaves has a taste similar to Onion and Leeks, said Menikge
This vegetable can be cultivated anywhere in Sri Lanka.
The vegetable has a bulb beneath the soil. The trunk of the Nira grows from the bulb and it is rather small. Underneath the soil a small Rhizome is also attached to this bulb and grows from it. From the Rhizome, roots and another bulb grows. And from that bulb another trunk grows. And from that trunk the leaves spread out. In this manner an entire bush can be grown. Unlike Onions the Nira plant has a very small bulb. Unlike leeks we do not remove the entire plant we cut the leaves off the trunk. More than planting seeds once you remove a Rhizome and plant it else where you can grow another bush, explained Menikge
From Nira leaves you can prepare many types of dishes. You cut the leaves off and the leaves can be used to make Omelettes. You can make a salad. The vegetable is full of nutrition. It gives a taste similar to leeks and onions. You can even make a curry and use it for noodles.
It can be grown in home gardens - in pots. The soil should have compost and should be sandy. Then you can reap a good harvest. It can endure intense cold and heat, surviving in any temperature. The benefit of growing this plant is that it is not attacked by insects or is not threatened by fungi.
When growing leeks you need to administer chemical fertilizer. But this is not so with Nira plants.
Because chemicals are not applied, the nira plant is free from problems connected with applying chemicals.
That is why it is so good for health. That is why it is ideal for children, added Menikge.
Unfortunately not many people know about Nira plants. It is also very tasty.
Eating Nira has many health benefits
* It is good for those with high blood pressure controlling it
* It is good for those with heart problems
* It helps with lowering the blood sugar level
* It controls cholesterol
It can be easily grown in home gardens. It can be grown in pots or in a hole in the garden. To get harvest from leeks it takes about six months. It takes around a month for the first harvest to appear.
When it comes to leeks plant we remove it entirely. When it comes to Nira when you cut the leaves off it regrows.
New leaves regrow from that cut point, added Menikge
Menikge said that the Nira leaves too have similar nutritional values as its onion.

I'll be back, vows Venus after Wimbledon heartache
LONDON AFP July15, 2017 Venus Williams vowed to make amends for her Wimbledon final heartache by ending a bittersweet year on a high at the US Open.
Williams failed in her bid to become the oldest Grand Slam champion in the Open era as the American star was crushed 7-5, 6-0 by Garbine Muguruza in Saturday's title match.
Instead of celebrating her sixth Wimbledon title, and first major trophy since 2008, the 37-year-old trudged off Centre Court looking her age for virtually the first time in her unexpected 2017 renaissance.
Venus, beaten by sister Serena in the Australian Open final in January, has reached the two Grand Slams finals in the same year for the first time since 2003.
Given her battle with the autoimmune disease that leaves her fatigued and once threatened to end her career, Venus's return to prominence is a tribute to her ferocious will to win.
With Serena set to miss the rest of the year as she prepares to have her first child, Venus will still be among the favourites to win her eighth Grand Slam title when the US Open gets underway in late August.
I'm in good form. I've been in a position a lot of times this year to contend for big titles, Venus said.
That's the kind of position I want to keep putting myself in. It's just about getting over the line. I believe I can do that.
This is where you want to be. I like to win. I don't want to just get to a final. It's just about playing a little better.
I've had a great two weeks. I'm looking forward to the rest of the summer. - Low note.
Batting away questions that invited her to blame the 24-minute second set meltdown on tiredness caused by her illness, Venus admitted she could have no complaints about the result.
Her only regret was a failure to take the break points that came her way in a fiercely fought first set.
Definitely would have loved to have converted some of those points. But she competed really well.
So credit to her. She played amazing, Venus said.
There's always something to learn from matches that you win and the ones that you don't win. So there's definitely something for me to learn from this.
I went for some big shots and they didn't land. Probably have to make less errors.
Umpire Eva Asderaki-Moore had inspected the barren, grassless baseline at Venus's request before play got underway on Centre Court, but the American wouldn't criticise the state of a surface that has come under fire from stars including Novak Djokovic.
They said the court was ready to go, so we started play, she said.
Twenty years after making her Wimbledon debut, Venus isn't keen to bow out on such a frustrating low note.
Asked if she would return next year, she said: Presumably, yes.
It took a lot of effort to get right here today. So this is where I want to be every single major.
What else can I say It was a great experience.
