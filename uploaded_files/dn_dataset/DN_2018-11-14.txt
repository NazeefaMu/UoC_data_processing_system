Over five vying for post of UNP leader
Over five persons are now eying on becoming the leader of the UNP. The UNP Leader is trying the same old tactic this time with the former Parliamentarian Sajith Premadasa.
He used this tactic on former Parliamentarian Sarath Fonseka in 2010, let him get defeated, and stayed on as the UNP Leader, former National Freedom Front (NFF) Parliamentarian and the NFF Media Spokesman Mohammad Muzammil said.
Speaking at a press conference at the NFF office in Pitakotte yesterday, he said the UNP should not try to solve its internal issues by dragging poor people into it. The UNP should not let foreign countries interfere in the internal affairs of the country because it has its own policy issues. The UNP is scared to ask for the peoples vote because it did not do anything for them and only made their life difficult day by day.
Even the former Speaker is now in line for the post of leader of the UNP. Before him there were several others. Leadership councils, the Rainbow Alliance or anything else will not stop the break up of the UNP, he said.
Now the TNA has already broken into three pieces: the Vigneswaran faction, the TNA, and the faction which left the TNA. They did nothing for the Tamil people during the past three-and-a-half years and only collected money for themselves. The TNA became rich, but not the Tamil people.
Therefore they are dead scared to ask for the peoples vote, Muzammil said.

Proof of independence of Judiciary
The Interim Order issued by the Supreme Court on the Dissolution of Parliament indicates the independence of the Judiciary under the rule of President Maithripala Sirisena, political and legal analysts said.
They have appreciated the Presidents stance of non-interference in the affairs of the Judiciary regarding a decision that he has made. In fact, they noted that the President has never influenced the work of the Judiciary in any way after he came to power in January 2015.
He has always sought rulings from the Judiciary on sensitive matters, including a controversy regarding the tenure of his term. On that occasion, the Supreme Court ruled that the 19th Amendment would be applicable to the sitting Precedent and hence, his term should end in five years and not six. The analysts said the Presidents upholding of the supremacy of the people should be admired by all.

You are not a failure until you start blaming others for your mistakes
As Sri Lankas cricket fortunes continue on a downward slide under head coach Chandika Hathurusingha, the latest setback to hit the team was the resignation of the team manager Charith Senanayake midway during the ongoing three-Test series against England.
According to reports appearing in the media Senanayake has been targeted as the scapegoat for the teams poor performances whereas he has nothing to do with the preparation of the team which is the responsibility of the coaching staff, the trainers and physios.
It has been stated that the head coach had wanted Senanayake sacked with immediate effect while the first Test against England at Galle was going on, but for his bad luck Sri Lanka Crickets CEO Ashley de Silva had been out of the country and the decision could not be taken.
However as soon as the Test match ended a day before schedule on Saturday, Senanayake had fired an email to the CEO stating that if his presence was detrimental to the teams performance he was immediately stepping down from his post as manager. Senanayake had been appointed manager from the ODI series against South Africa in July this year.
Although SLC tried to coax Senanayake to stay back until the end of the series, the former Sri Lanka Test opener would have none of it. And when SLC tried to offer him the post of manager of the Sri Lanka A team Senanayake a no-nonsense manager flatly refused it.
What we hear from the grapevine is that the head coach was uncomfortable with Senanayakes presence in their midst because he was able to spotlight the shortcomings of the coaching staff, so he had to go.
This is not the first time that the head coach has palmed off the blame for the teams defeats onto someone else.
When Sri Lanka performed disastrously in the Asia Cup in UAE losing to teams like Bangladesh and Afghanistan and were knocked out in the first round of the tournament, it was the Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews who was made the scapegoat for the countrys losses.
He was not only stripped of the one-day captaincy but also dropped from the ODI and T20I squads for the matches against England.
Mathews hit back at the selectors decision to remove him from the captaincy by sending a letter to SLC CEO Ashley de Silva in which he stated the following: I write to you pursuant to the meeting held on Friday the 21st of September 2018 at SLC premises, which was attended by all the selectors along with the National Cricket Coach Mr. Chandika Hathurusingha. At this meeting the selection committee and the coach informed me to step down as Sri Lankas captain of the ODI and T20 team. Though I was initially surprised, it was immediately felt that I have been made the scapegoat in this entire saga of Sri Lankas dismal performances against Bangladesh and Afghanistan in the Asia Cup. Im willing to take part of the blame but at the same time, feel betrayed and let down if the blame is solely put on me. As you know all decisions are taken through a mutual understanding with the Selectors and the Head Coach. And though I do not agree with the reasoning that the losses should be accrued single handed to the Captaincy, I however eagerly and wholeheartedly respect the request of the selection committee and the head coach in asking me to step down and do so with immediate effect.
Mathews further stated that it was Hathurusingha who immediately after he was appointed as head coach had approached him and requested him to take up the Sri Lanka captaincy until the World Cup 2019.
The reasons given for Mathews omission from the ODI team and the captaincy was his supposed lack of fitness and his poor record in running between the wickets. Mathews and Hathurusingha had been at odds since.
However in the recently concluded first Test against England at Galle which Sri Lanka lost by 211 runs where Mathews emerged as the stand out batsman for the side with back to back fifties, Hathurusingha did a complete U turn and showered praise on Mathews performance placing him on the level of Virat Kohli, Steve Smith and Joe Root.
I would have thought he would have been in Virat Kohli, Joe Root and Steve Smiths level, because hes capable of getting to that level as a batsman. I think he has realised that and hes worked hard in the last eight months to get himself fit. Im hoping for big things from him, said Hathurusingha.
Since Hathurusingha took over as head coach the only format that Sri Lanka had remained unbeaten is in Tests  they won against Bangladesh 1-0, drew the series in the Caribbean against West Indies 1-all and beat South Africa 2-0 at home.
That record now stands on the brink of being broken with Sri Lanka trailing England 0-1 in the present three-Test series with two matches to play. Who will be targeted as the next scapegoat if that loss happens
The head coach should be reminded of the famous words of late John Wooden, American basketball player and coach of the University of California, Los Angeles: You are not a failure until you start blaming others for your mistakes.

Anuradhapura farmers face fertilizer subsidy issue
Farmers in Anuradhapura district are facing a scarcity of subsidised fertilizer in the open market.
Farmers organisations in Galenbindunwewa, Wilachciya, Kahatagasdigiliya, Horowpothana, Rathmalgahawewa, Medawachchiya, Rambewa, and Seeppukulama have complained to the authorities that some fertilizer dealers are demanding that farmers buy six bags of urea for issuing a bag of MOP or TSP at the subsidised rate of Rs. 1,000 (earlier Rs. 1,500) per 50kg bag.
Referring to the issue, Anuradhapura Assistant Agrarian Development Commissioner Asanka Somawansa told the Daily News that there was no shortage of subsidised fertilizer in the district. Farmers could buy fertilizer such as urea, MOP and TSP from the 41 agrarian development centres at the subsidised rate of Rs. 500 per 50kg bag for paddy. We have made arrangements to distribute 40,000mt of fertilizer for cultivating a minimum of 125,000 hectares. The problem pertains to the fertilizer sold at Rs. 1,000 per 50 kg bag (earlier Rs. 1,500) in the open market, without any restriction.
It is reported that in some instances fertilizer traders maintain that MOP and TSP fertilizer could be issued only to farmers who buy more urea fertilizer. Also, there are complaints that some fertilizer dealers are still continuing to sell the subsidised fertilizer at the old rate of Rs. 1,500 per 50kg bag ignoring the present rate of Rs. 1,000.
Somawansa has directed fertilizer secretariat officials and the 675 agriculture research and production assistants to probe the matter and take action against offenders.
Meanwhile, Fertilizer Secretariat Director Ajith Pushpakumara discussed the matter with farmer organisation representatives, representatives of the authorised fertilizer distribution companies such as Baurs, CIC, Dimo, and Haleys, and fertilizer traders at the Kahatagasdigiliya agrarian development centre recently. Farmers urged the director to make immediate arrangements to distribute subsidised Rs. 1,000 fertilizer through the 41 agrarian development centres, in addition to the open market. At present, only paddy farmers are issued fertilizer at the rate of Rs. 500 per 50kg bag through the agrarian centres. Also, farmers asked that LakPohora and other companies too be authorised to deal in marketing the subsidised Rs. 1,000 fertilizer.

Apple iPhone sales fears rock Wall Street
Apple shares sank by 5% on Monday, dragging down US markets and wiping more than $40bn off the tech giants market value. The fall followed a profit warning from some of the firms suppliers, which exacerbated concerns that demand for iPhones is slowing.
The declines made the company one of the biggest losers on the Dow, which closed down 2.3%.
The wider S&P 500 ended about 2% lower, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.75%. Technology stocks led the Wall Street sell-off which saw shares in most sectors tumble.
Tech firms helped drive many of the stock market gains earlier in the year but now face rising calls for regulatory and tax changes that could hurt their growth. Amazon shares lost more than 4%, Alphabet dropped over 2.5% while Facebook fell 2.3%. Apples share price fall came after Lumentum, a US manufacturer of facial recognition technology and Apple supplier, said one of its major customers had reduced its shipments.
As a result, Lumentum downgraded its sales and profit outlook, sending its shares down over 30%. Lumentums warning came shortly after another Apple supplier, Japan Display, also cut its full-year guidance blaming volatile customer demand.
The warnings from Apple suppliers extended a slide in Apple shares that started earlier this month after the firms sales forecast disappointed investors. The shares closed at about $194, down 5% for the day and more than 15% below their peak in October.
Apple has insisted that it is optimistic about its Christmas season outlook, attributing the weaker than expected forecast to one-off changes, such as the timing of the release of new phones, and temporary supply chain issues. (BBC)

Brayan quoted Its been a privilege to drive here in India with some of the best drivers the country has produced and to have won the race is just amazing. Looking at the race weekend, it was tough but we had the pace throughout the weekend, and to have come out on top is definitely one of the best feelings, however the jobs not done yet. We have two more rounds and the championship battle is very close. Would definitely love to
win it but there are some very good drivers who have their eye on it as well, lets see what happens. Finishing the weekend on a high, the momentum is definitely with Brayan Perera as he has matched the pace of the front-runners and currently sits 4th in the championship.

Bulldozer mentality of the Western Powers
On May 27, 1991 when the British High Commissioner David Gladstone was declared persona non grata by President Ranasinghe Premadasa for interfering with the countrys internal affairs, many international watchers such as this columnist felt, though the meddling Toms should be told where to get off, Premadasa should not have taken that extreme step.
Nearly 10 years ago when President Mahinda Rajapaksa gave a patient hearing to British Secretary of State David Miliband and French Foreign Minister Bernard Kushner under the shade of a tamarind tree in Ambilipitiya and told them to mind their own business, we were happy about the stand taken by Sri Lanka, but wondered whether the way they were treated was in line with diplomatic protocol.
These two incidents came to the mind when the latest incident of eight Western envoys staying away from the first meeting with foreign envoy called by amiable new Foreign Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama to brief them on the current political developments and constitutional provisions pertaining to recent steps taken by the government.
Since, the removal of Ranil Wickremesinghe and appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister some of the Western countries led by the United States and the European Union had been urging President Maithripala Sirisena to reconvene Parliament and let the legislature determine who should be prime minister. The President issued Gazette Notification to reconvene Parliament on November 14, but due to undemocratic developments such as influencing Members of Parliament to cross over by offering huge bribes and the Speaker Karu Jayasuriyas peculiar behaviour of surpassing his powers and calling public servants not to follow orders, the President decided to dissolve Parliament and call for a general election.
Foreign Minister briefed foreign diplomats based in Colombo at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and clarified the chain of events that compelled President Sirisena to arrive at the decision to dissolve Parliament. He emphasized the constitutionality of the steps taken by President Sirisena and added that having being elected through a nation-wide vote, the President derives his authority directly from the people of Sri Lanka.
It is most unfortunate that diplomatic representatives of the so-called champions of democracy were not there to listen to Minister Amunugamas stand that in the event of a conflict within the supreme democratic institution, seeking a mandate from people was the best democratic alternative available to the government.
Democratic traditions
Meddling foreign missions have failed to take note of the peaceful atmosphere that continues to prevail in Sri Lanka in the midst of internal political changes. This is to the credit of the people of Sri Lanka and re-affirms the democratic traditions of the country, Dr. Amunugama said.
President Sirisena, took the law and order machinery also into his command to effectively discharge his responsibility of ensuring the security and safety of all Sri Lankans. It is a credit to these measures that no untoward incident has taken place despite prevalent of political tensions.
While the United States and Western powers try to interfere in internal politics in a shameless blatant manner, Russia, China, Japan, Pakistan and several other countries came forward to extend fullest support to the genuine democratic efforts taken by the government, thus proving who the real friends of Sri Lanka are.
Several diplomatic representatives present at the briefing expressed their confidence in the strength of Sri Lankas longstanding democratic traditions in resolving this internal matter.
Those who allegedly boycotted Foreign Ministers briefing include the ambassadors of Britain, Netherlands, Norway, France, Australia, South Africa, Italy, and Canada. However, European Union, the United States, Germany and India sent junior representatives. Twenty heads of missions turned up for the meeting including those of China, Cuba, Afghanistan, Turkey and Pakistan.
In a surprising move, the EU, instead of watching the developments to see if there will be any deterioration in the areas of reconciliation and human rights, thought it was befitting to issue a warning that it could withdraw trade concessions if Sri Lanka backs off commitments on human rights.
At the meeting Foreign Minister Amunugama said no country has said anything about cancelling grants, concessions or loans. Although, the United States supposedly holding off the proposed US$480 million infrastructure grant from Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) until the political crisis is resolved and democratic rights are restored, the fact is that the MCC grant will commence only in 2019 and they will be able to judge for themselves whether the human rights situation is satisfactory or not because the political crisis will well be over by then.
Answering a question earlier if there was any threat of de-recognizing Sri Lanka by any country, Dr Amunugama told media that there is no question of recognition here. No foreign Government has stopped recognizing the Government of Sri Lanka as embodied in the President of this country. Only the other day, the President accepted the credentials of Ambassadors for US, France, Japan and Afghanistan. There are daily contacts with the foreign representatives in Sri Lanka. So, there has no issue of recognizing. All are recognized and nothing has been changed. So as far as this Government is concerned, it is business as usual. In terms of the Constitution, the President has taken some decisions that are not the concern of others, Foreign Minister said.
Constitutional rights
The step taken by President Sirisena is in accordance with his constitutional rights and if foreign Governments want, they can express an opinion. However, they have no right to intervene in internal affairs of Sri Lanka, a sovereign, democratic nation.
Of course, any friendly country can express their desire for peace and calm in Sri Lanka. Now they can be satisfied that there had been no violence due to the political turmoil. What some of the media has portrayed abroad as acts of violence were matters unrelated to politics. The incident at the Petroleum Ministry was due to a clash between two rival trade unions. Since then there had not been any incident of violence.
Talking about foreign interference in local elections, let us go back to Gladstone incident. In the 1990s Britain was considered as one of the biggest aid donors to Sri Lanka. British High Commissioner, David Gladstone CMG (most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George) was a descendent of one time British Prime Minister, William Gladstone.
During the local government elections in 1991, Gladstone went to Dickwella Police station and lodged a report that having observed some irregularities during the local elections. Such interference in an election was against all norms of diplomatic conduct and President Premadasa ordered then Foreign Secretary Bernard Tilakaratna to declare David Gladstone persona non grata and evict the diplomat from the country. Sri Lanka may have lost some British grants at that time, but London later saw the rationale of the move and resumed relations with Sri Lanka. They did not even evict the Sri Lanka High Commissioner in London.
The interfering Toms Dicks or Harrys should understand that there is a limit to a patience of a proud nation and grants and concessions are no match when it is an issue of the pride of the nation.

Case to be taken up on November 15
Accessibility Rights Activist Dr. Ajith C. S. Perera, Chief Executive of Idiriya, hasmoved the Court to re-activate invocation of a Fundamental Rights Public Interest Litigation.
The Court fixed the date for the next hearing on November 15 and November 29 for arguments.
The litigation is to seek redress for the marginalised group with limited mobility, estimated to be 20 percent of Sri Lankas population.
The subject matter concerns continual poor compliance with laws and a Court Order on accessibility made 12 years ago. This results in continual infringement of rights of nearly 4 million people who are unable to access even new buildings and facilities, Dr. Perera stated.
Dr. Pereras motion is supported by four affidavits - one by himself and three by others.
He hasappealed for an order from the Supreme Court to strengthen the earlier order dated April 27, 2011.
In view of the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of People with Disabilities (CRPD) being ratified by Sri Lanka on February 8, 2016, the need for implementation of this legally binding agreement is urgent. We have been found in default of our obligations to comply with international law when compliance would be easy to achieve starting with Article 9  Accessibility and the fact that several major development projects  which will need to be used by future generations  are just being started, the need for action is urgent if yet more people are not to be severely disadvantaged, Dr. Perera stated.
At the last hearing on October 4, 2018, Petitioner Dr. Perera and Senior State Counsel Rajitha Perera appeared for the Attorney General representing the Respondents before a Bench presided over by Justice Vijith K. Malalgoda PC and Justice M.N.B. Fernando PC.
Leave was granted to proceed for Violation of the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioner representing 4 million underprivileged people experiencing physical impediments, guaranteed in terms of Articles 12(1), 12(4) and 14(1) of the Constitution.
During the proceedings, Dr. Perera presented the following facts.
The Ministryof Social Servicespromulgated a comprehensive detailed set of regulations gazetted under 1,4657/15 dated October 17, 2006. They specify clearly the manner in which steps, railings, toilets and other key parts of all types of buildings the public needs to use in life, shall be designed and constructed enabling access and safety to persons with disabilities. They were then passed unanimously by Parliament on March 20, 2007.
Despite valiant renewed efforts by this Ministry over 12 long years to implement these Access Regulations and in spite of an Order issued by the Supreme Court dated April 27, 2011 under SCFR 221/2009, we have seen a proliferation of new buildings, being completed which still largely fail to comply with the requirements and thus continue to pose a potential threat to safety of life and loss of productive opportunities, thereby causing unwanted dependency and added burdens on society economically, socially and mentally, infringing the Rights of nearly 4 million people.
I have visited personally over 30 places and have observed the correctness of cries, complaints and grievances by the public and several medical practitioners. Worst offenders include many 5 and 4 star hotels, even numerous places of higher education institutes and universities, private sector hospitals, high-end shopping complexes, supermarkets and all forms of transport. The parts affected most are toilets, steps and railings, signage and ramps at entrances. Even the design of tables and desks at receptions and in restaurants continue to pose inaccessibility.
He pleaded for early disposal to this case, in view of the long time already taken and the increasing need for urgent action for the reasons set out in his case.
The Bench stated they were bound by the rules of the Court and thereby, in their opinion, had to grant Respondents further fair opportunity to submit objections or further material before this court.
Dr. Perera said he is prepared to forget the violators and was appealing for a Strengthened Order applicable only to new buildings, where there could be no excuse for failure to comply.

CIABOC must act on  Presidents statement -TISL
In light of the allegations made by President Maithripala Sirisena, in his statement on Sunday (11), over the commercialisation of Members of Parliament, Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) urges the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) to act swiftly to enforce the law and hold accountable persons involved in offering and accepting bribes to Members of Parliament.
Whilst TISL filed a complaint with CIABOC last week with evidence of an attempt to bribe a MP, we wish to once again bring to the attention of the public, Section 14 of the Bribery Act which prescribes a maximum 7-year prison sentence for the offence of offering a bribe to a MP or when a MP accepts a bribe.
Speaking on the matter, TISL Executive Director Asoka Obeyesekere said, given the President's acknowledgement of the inducements being offered, coupled with the clear evidence of bribery, CIABOC must immediately communicate to the public the steps that it has taken to ensure accountability.
Following the prorogation of Parliament in the wake of the contested change in government, the TISL expressed concerns that the state of limbo cold create an environment conducive to bribery and corruption.
Obeyesekere added statements made by MP's themselves on the vast sums of money being offered in exchange for loyalty have confirmed these fears.
CIABOC must use its power to proactively investigate allegations made against all political factions, in order to halt this alarming trend and rebuild public trust in the rule of law.

Why the former premier failed in his job
There are various ways to analyze why the former Prime Minister failed in his job. This is the way I look at this problem. According to our rules and regulations, President is the chief. The Prime Minister is second in command.
He should have treated President as his boss. There is a way to manage your boss. I have indicated below the important rules to follow when working with your boss:
Be a problem solver. Not a problem creator.
Stay calm even when everything around you is in a state of chaos.
Never make excuses.
Make your boss good look. No one has ever achieved greatness by putting someone else down.
Be a consistently positive force. Discipline yourself to seek the positive in every situation.
Whether you like it or not, this is the correct way to work with your boss. Otherwise there will be confusion and disappointment. Hope this lesson will help the biggest person in an organisation and also the junior officers.

CNN sues White House  over barring of reporter
CNN sued Donald Trump's administration Tuesday, alleging the White House violated journalist Jim Acosta's constitutional rights by revoking his press credentials following a heated exchange with the US president.
The row on live national television and Acosta's resulting banishment triggered a wave of accusations that Trump is stifling the free press, and marked a sharp escalation in tensions between the president and CNN, a frequent target of his ire.
The wrongful revocation of these credentials violates CNN and Acosta's First Amendment rights of freedom of the press, and their Fifth Amendment rights to due process, the news network said in a statement that announced the lawsuit filed in a Washington federal court.
We have asked this court for an immediate restraining order requiring the pass be returned to Jim, and will seek permanent relief as part of this process, CNN said, warning that Acosta's credential suspension could set precedent for future attacks on o - AFP

Colourful makeover with sculptures
Spanish street artist Okuda San Miguel has brought more colour to the streets of Boston with his largest public art project to date. Air Sea Land is an installation composed of seven large-scale permanent sculptures that have transformed the Boston Seaport with their kaleidoscope of colours.
Ranging between eight feet and twelve feet tall, the artworks were installed on alternate medians along Seaport Boulevard, creating an art corridor that brightens the urban landscape. Using his signature geometric forms to build up three-dimensional characters, Okuda drew from mythological figures as well as local wildlife to pull together the series of striking sculptures.
Art must be present in public spaces constantly and my mission is to transform these spaces in a way that further enhances the passerbys experience, the Spanish artist shares.
I aim at creating vibrant places that are filled with colour and positivity. I want people to stop looking at the pavement and start looking up and around.
Through Okudas work, we are reminded of the tangible beings that thrive from the co-existence of different elements. This positive message, one that carries through much of the artists work, is a push for viewers to ponder their own place in the world and the marvel at the fantastical creatures born from nature.
The project was curated by JustKids, which has previously brought Okudas work to other parts of the United States, in collaboration with property developer WS Development.
The Boston Seaport has set up a special virtual tour of Air Sea Land, which gives insight into each individual sculpture. My Modern Met

ComBank gross income surpasses  Rs 100 bn for first time
Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC gross income surpassed the Rs 100 billion mark in nine months for the first time growing by 21.61% to Rs 102.841 billion, with interest income improving by a robust 17.39% to Rs 88.825 billion on the back of a strong loan book growth.
Interest expenses increased at a lower rate of 12.09% to Rs 53.160 billion, due to timely re-pricing of liabilities despite a substantial increase in deposits. Notably, both deposits and loans have recorded YoY growth of more than Rs 125 billion.
Net interest income for the nine months at Rs 35.666 billion represented an improvement of Rs 7.424 billion or 26.29%. Incidentally, net interest income accounted for 73.81% of the total operating income of the Bank.
The Bank reported a 17.85% improvement in net fees and commission income, amounting to Rs 7.249 billion for the nine months and representing 15% of the total operating income. Other income, including exchange profit, recoveries of loans written off/provided for and net gains/losses from trading and financial instruments, grew by a remarkable 244.56% to Rs 5.406 billion.
As a result, the total operating income of Rs 48.321 billion for the nine months ending September 30, 2018 reflected a growth of 34.37% over the corresponding period of last year.
The prevailing weak market conditions resulted in an increase in non-performing loans and advances, pushing the total impairment charges for loans and other losses for the period under review to Rs 6.864 billion from Rs 1.494 billion for the first nine months of 2017. Consequently, the growth of the net operating income was hampered, restricting it to 20.28% to reach Rs 41.456 billion.
Operating expenses at Rs 17.189 billion for the period, reflected the Banks success in managing its overheads with an increase of 16.54% despite salary increments and the costs of expansion. As a result, the Bank reported a profit before VAT and NBT of Rs 24.267 billion for the nine months, an improvement of 23.07%.
The VAT and NBT on Financial Services for the period amounted to Rs. 4.213 billion compared to Rs. 3.486 billion paid in the corresponding period last year, reflecting an increase of 20.86%.

Emphasises need to  strengthen multilateralism
We need to look at how best multilateralism can be advanced and strengthened rather than at theories that suggest a doomsday scenario or the dawn of an era of post-multilateralism, Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to UNO in Geneva Ambassador A.L.A. Azeez said.
He made these remarks following his election by acclamation as the Chairperson of the 10th Session of the UNCTAD Trade and Development Commission.
Addressing the opening session, he stated UNCTAD is an innovative platform where both theories and practices are analysed and pathways and options identified, to help guide nations in their search for solutions to trade and development constraints and challenges.
The newly elected Chairperson of the UNCTAD Trade and Development Commission stressed that Member States needed to look ahead and bring out aspects of Strategies, during the week-long deliberations in the Commission, that could help countries achieve progress in SDGs, with particular emphasis on making trade and development a critical enabler of the realization of the aspirations of people everywhere, for peace and prosperity.
In a message sent to the Commission, the Director-General of UNCTAD, Mukhisa Kituyi, stated that in these uncertain times we cannot afford to let worries over international trade put the 2030 Agenda at risk.
He assured that UNCTAD would continue to do all it could to help countries put trade to work for their development, even as global prospects appear uncertain. The representatives of the Group of 77, the African Union and the Group of Caribbean and Latin American States made statements expressing the perspectives of the respective Groups.
The week-long meeting of Member States and other stakeholders of UNCTAD Trade and Development Commission provides an opportunity to discuss key trade and development issues related to building more resilient, sustainable and inclusive development.
The Commission considers a broad range of reports from expert Groups including on Competition Law and Policy, Consumer Protection Law and Policy, Commodities and Development; Trade, Services and Development; Enhancing the Enabling Economic Environment at All Levels in Support of Inclusive and Sustainable Development, and the Promotion of Economic Integration and Cooperation. It also reviews progress made in promoting and strengthening the synergies between the three pillars of the work of UNCTAD, research & analysis, consensus building and technical cooperation, in the areas covered by this Commission.
The current state of trade, multilateral cooperation and sustainable development is also under review.

Empowered to accomplish
Head Boy Kirthikesh Kirubakaran and Head Girl of Belvoir College International Habishnna Nagarajan focus on becoming valuable assets to society. Perfect Prefects features these two prefects who use their talents and skills to make a better society.
Head Boy of Belvoir College International, Kirthikesh Kirubakaran is calm and collected infecting others with his passion. His calmness allows him to fully exercise his ability to infect others with his enthusiasm.
Young people need role models who show passion for their work and are able to infect others with their passion. Role models should be active in their communities acting in ways that would benefit people. When there is a problem we should learn to remain calm analyzing what the cause of the problem is and take the best decision to overcome the obstacle, said Kirubakaran
Vanishing demons
Kirubakaran is of the opinion that a mind with the necessary information and a heart in the right place combined with discipline can be a powerful force. The presence of this trinity can make a change because ignorance and ignoring will not make the problem go away. Only through awareness and concern can we make our demons vanish. I consider Mahatma Gandhi an outstanding individual. He believed correctly that kindness can accomplish so much. Kindness makes the difference. I feel creating awareness concerning the problems in this world is essential and that turning a blind eye is not the correct response. We need to make people aware as to what is taking place in the world. My teachers have guided me along the right path and provided me with the necessary discipline that has aided me in balancing my studies, sports and other activities, explained Kirubakaran.
People will have faith in your leadership if they understand that you are genuine. If you display the same flaws that they have in their characters then you cant complain if they dont follow you.
Correct steps
I feel that before trying to correct other people when they err, we need to first examine our thoughts and see if the same fault lies in us, and then immediately take steps to correct that which is erroneous.
Then they can have faith in our leadership, pointed out Kirubakaran.
Crime and poverty are interlinked. While there is poverty there will always be the crime. Poverty can drive people out of their minds.
Desperation can make a man or woman resort to desperate measures. Ultimately we all lose when it comes to poverty.
I feel that poverty creates most of the demons in society and eradication of poverty is essential. My message to young people is to be bold when facing challenges and do the right thing. I believe in setting goals in life and becoming the best version of myself that I can be, stated Kirubakaran.
Being well informed can give you more control over your life and Kirubakaran means business.
Business touch
I feel one of the most exciting events in todays world is how the IT field is progressing and how technology is developing into an important facet in our lives that is indispensable. I read a lot of business articles so I will know what is happening in the real world and I take an interest when it comes to studying different problems in business. Thanks also go out to my parents for making me the person I am now and supporting me in life. My family is always behind me, said Kirubakaran.
Head Girl of Belvoir College International Habishnna Nagarajan believes in wellbeing, peace and balance when it comes to mind and body. She also believes in our connection to nature which is an intrinsic part of life.
I would recommend that Yoga be introduced into the school curriculum as a subject. It strengthens you and increases your powers of concentration. It also brings harmony to both mind and body. Yoga includes breathing exercises which help handle pressure. I do meditation because it gives me a sense of equanimity and refreshes me. I am concerned about Global Warming. Global warming is destroying the earth, we need to take measures in order to reduce it. We can use renewable resources more than unrenewable resources, and reforestation and recycling can be done. I love and admire simple things in nature, such as the incredible hues of the sunset. This revives me. It revitalizes me, explained Nagarajan.
Disciplinary foundation
It would not be incorrect to say that our lives are measured by the discipline we display. Discipline is also part of wellbeing. Discipline is what creates a foundation for all of lifes pursuits.
School has taught me a variety of things helping me to build up my character and one valuable skill I have acquired is time management. Time is the predominant factor in everyones life. I consider this a gift. In addition to that it has embedded in my valuable leadership qualities and discipline, added Nagarajan.
Paediatricians share in the creation of life. They care for children and share in the joy of life because children are Gods creation. In caring for children they too share in creation.
My ambition is to become a paediatrician because I strongly feel that doctors are those who stand after god because they save lives and I wish to render my services willingly. I would also like to say that the best role models I would suggest for young people are their parents because they work tirelessly to bring up their children and they encourage and support their children to achieve their goals. This makes them ideal role models, pointed out Nagarajan.
Like her Head Boy Kirubakaran, she too believes in facing adversity with courage. Nagarajan advises not to play hide and seek with the obstacles you encounter and be courageous enough to tackle all the problems. Her favourite books are the popular and irresistible Harry Potter series. The story of the boy wizard who also shows great courage.

As Sri Lankas premier technology conglomerate, it is our distinct pleasure to join hands with Association of Compliance Officers of Bankers Sri Lanka in their efforts to host Sri Lankas inaugural compliance convention, said Viraj Mudalige, MD/CEO of Epic Lanka Technology Group.
Over the past few years, we have seen a number of manifestations of sophisticated money launderers across the globe that makes bankers work around the clock and re-think their strategy and execution to curb these attempts. Thus, compliance and corporate governance have become two important factors for banks and there has been an increase in investments on anti-money laundering (AML) compliance and fraud prevention measures by these organizations to fortify their perimeter defenses.
As the biggest compliance convention of Sri Lanka, we believe that Compliance Symposium 2018 will be an ideal opportunity to bring together the best local and international minds together on a single platform and deliberate on the many challenges and opportunities facing banks and other stakeholders of the industry, Mudalige added.
The regulatory compliance landscape is dynamic and constantly evolving. Besides domestic compliance mandates, there are several critical global mandates which financial institutions need to comply with. Advanced real-time, cross-channel fraud + AML/CFT technology solutions such as Clari5 use a human brain like approach to help banks stay compliant proactively as well as mitigate fraud risk. We are excited to be at the upcoming Compliance Symposium to share more details on how banks can radically change the way they address risk and compliance, said Rivi Varghese, CEO, CustomerXPs.
The Association of Compliance Officers of Banks (ACOB) is an institution, which was established in 2010, with the intention of a building a forum to promote a common understanding among Compliance Officers on regulations as well as share experiences and knowledge across banks in building effective compliance systems and procedures.
The steps taken to form ACOB resonated positively when the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and the Financial Transactions Reporting Act were introduced, which required financial institutions to have in place a Compliance Officer who is responsible for establishing procedures and systems in respect of Know your Customer (KYC), customer due diligence, training, retention, reporting etc.
Established in the year 1998, Epic Technology Group today is a leader in providing world-class state-of-the-art ICT solutions to financial institutes, governments and corporate organizations across the globe. Epic is an award-winning regional technology leader that has made vast strides in terms of adopting and delivering modern technology in the verticals of Financial Services Industry (FSI) Applications, information system security, enterprise digitalization, mobile applications and e-governance, both locally and internationally.

Europes oldest intact book
Europes oldest intact book has been discovered after being closed inside a hermit monks coffin for over 400 years. It will go on display at the British Library as part of an exhibition featuring prized manuscripts like the Lindisfarne Gospels and Beowulf. The show is a once in a lifetime opportunity to see how medieval Anglo-Saxons depicted their own culture through early writings.
Among the precious materials is the Stonyhurst Gospel, a small book that holds a lot of history. Also known as the St. Cuthbert Gospel, this Latin copy of the Gospel of John was discovered inside the coffin of St. Cuthbert, a hermit monk who died in 687 CE. Its said that his body was found incorrupt decades after his death and this led to a cult that placed sacrifices around his remains.
Sometime after 698 CE, a small red book made its way into St. Cuthberts tomb along with other offerings. The book, a rare surviving medieval manuscript, was removed from his coffin in 1104 CE and transferred to Durham Cathedral, where it was kept as a separate relic. In 2012, The British Library acquired the 1,300-year-old text, which still retained its original binding and pages. The books binding is covered in a deep crimson stained goatskin, which was stuck to boards while still damp. The decoration of the boards was enriched by tooling and coloring lines on the surface, with the tip of a fine folder or a stylus, describes The British Library, which has also digitized the book.
The left board is decorated with a rectangular frame with interlace patterns in the upper and lower fields and a larger central field containing a chalice from which stems project, terminating in a leaf or bud and four fruits. This raised motif was apparently made using a matrix, with a clay-like substance beneath the leather.
The St. Cuthbert Gospel, along with many other treasures, is on view at the British Library as part of Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms: Art, Word, War from October 19, 2018 to February 19, 2019.

Payments for SLCCA bought potatoes:
Farmers seek Presidents intervention
The potato cultivators in Welimada and Uva Paranagama request President Maithripala Sirisena to instruct relevant authorities to pay them Rs. 90 million for their harvest that the Sri Lanka Consumer Cooperative Association (SLCCA) bought from them during the government that lasted a few weeks ago.
Since the potato price dropped during the last few months, the SLCCA bought the potato harvest of the farmers at centres at Welimada, Bogahakumbura, Nugathalawa, Uvaparanagama, Mediwela and Ambagasdova from October 1 to October 9 this year. The farmers told that the SLCCA bought 1.8 million kg of potatoes from them, but the money for the purchase has not yet been settled.
The farmers said they cannot commence the Maha season cultivation since they did not get their income of the previous season. They said 50 kg of seed potatoes cost them Rs. 25,000 and the farmers in Welimada cultivate imported seed potato for the Maha season from November to January and a part of its harvest they cultivate in the Yala season from May to August.
Welimada and Uva Paranagama Potato farmers Association President D. M. Siriwardena said that if the potato cultivation failed in the Maha season, it would directly affect the cultivation in the Yala season.
If we delay the cultivation in the rainy season, farmers will lack water for their cultivation later, Siriwardena said. We brought this matter to the notice of the previous government, but they failed to resolve the issue. We request President Maithripala Sirisena to resolve our problem, he said.

Fists of fury
Sri Lanka is a nation that had mothered countless war heroes and valiant soldiers who had fought to safeguard their motherland from alien forces.
A pioneering Sinhalese martial arts method called Angam Pora gave might to patriots who indulged in combat against invaders centuries back.
Sri Siddha, the newest film by Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekera tells the story of King Vijayabahu 1 and Angam Pora guru called Budanna who assisted the King in his battles against invading Cholas.
Sri Siddha will showcase native ancient fighting method of Angam Pora that was dreaded by Portuguese, Dutch and English intruders.
Golden inscription
Rear Admiral
Sarath Weerasekera
At the Muhurath ceremony of the film the director cum screenplay writer of the film Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekera said an ancient golden script aka Ran Sannasa found by a farmer lived in Matara in 1948 and read by Prof Senarath Paranavithana in 1949 was the source for the screenplay of Sri Siddha.
This ancient script handwritten by the king Vijayabahu I himself had been a token of appreciation to his closest aid Budanna who had been an expert in Angam Pora. Budanna had bravely battled against enemies to save his king. Because of Budanna, the king survived to lead the rebellion against Cholas to reunite the country in 1070, he said.
This particular Ran Sannasa of King Vijayabahu 1 now kept at the Colombo Museum adds immense credibility to the authenticity of the Sri Siddha story.
The film will showcase Angam Pora at its best fought in thick jungles and in the war front.
Famed Angam Pora guru, Ritigala Sumedha who brought breathtaking Angam Pora fights to Sarath Weerasekeras maiden film Gamani stars in Sri Siddha as Budanna.
The film that would start with the farmer finding the ancient script (Ran Sannasa) would flashback to the period in which the King Vijayabahu 1 lived.
Heights of power
The King was born as Prince Keerthi in 1039. At the time the southern part of our country had been ruled by Cholas and at the height of their power they took steps to eliminate all potential Sinhala kings, said the director.
The film will emphasize dedication of a King to save his country from invaders. To love the country, one should know the countrys history and Sri Siddha will stimulate within people eagerness to know our countrys history, he added.
Co-producers of Sri Siddha are Thusitha Wijesena of Aloko Udapaadi fame, University Lecturer Gunapala Ratnasekera, Dr Malika Jayasuriya and Anuradha Yahampath. Executive producer is Praveen Jayaratne.
The Muhurath ceremony was attended by Venerable Bengamuwe Nalaka, Elle Gunawansa Theras, Udayakantha Warnasuriya, Bennet Ratnayake, Sudath Rohana, actor Ritigala Sumedha and scholars.
A demonstration of Angam Pora by Ritigala Sumedhas students with actual swords kept the audience spellbound.

German prosecutors probing illegal  donations to AfD
German prosecutors are looking into foreign campaign donations made to the far-right AfD party ahead of the last election, Der Spiegel weekly reported Tuesday, as pressure grows on co-leader Alice Weidel over the alleged illegal payments.
Following press reports, the public prosecutor's office of Lake Constance is examining whether there are indications for possible criminal acts, a spokesman told Spiegel.
Prosecutors could not immediately be reached for comment when contacted by AFP.
German media at the weekend reported that the Lake Constance branch of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party received a total of 18 donations from a Swiss pharmaceutical firm between July and September 2017, to the tune of 150,000 Swiss francs (around 130,000 euros).
Under German law, campaign donations from non-EU countries are illegal.
The payments reportedly came with the message campaign donation Alice Weidel.
Lake Constance is the southern German district where top AfD figure Weidel was standing in the 2017 election, which saw huge gains for the anti-Islam, anti-immigrant party.
She is now co-leader of the AfD's parliamentary group.
Weidel, who divides her time between Germany and Switzerland where her partner and children live, said she had no information about the campaign donor and stressed that the money was later repaid.
Nevertheless, politicians from other parties have been lining up to condemn her handling of the affair.
Lawmaker Britta Hasselmann from the opposition Greens accused Weidel of playing the public for fools by claiming she was unaware that foreign donations were illegal.
MP Johannes Kars of the Social Democrats, Chancellor Angela Merkel's junior coalition partner, said if the money is confirmed to have violated spending laws then Weidel should resign.
Anti-corruption group Transparency International urged Weidel to explain when exactly she learned of the improper payments and what action was taken.
The Bundestag federal parliament has also asked the AfD to explain the payments.
The Swiss company behind the donations told German media it was acting on behalf of a business friend but declined to name names.

Govt should promote local business,  partner with them - Harry Jayawardena
The new government should promote local business entrepreneurs and look at entering into joint venture partnerships with local companies rather than offering 100% of projects to foreign companies, said Sri Lankan business magnate and investor Harry Jayawardena.
He was speaking at the Business Today Top 30 awards ceremony on Monday night at Shangri- La Hotel Colombo. Sri Lanka should not go with the Begging bowl to countries seeking loans. What I am saying is not to discourage foreign projects but give more support to encourage and egg on local enterprises which has all the resources and talent to match any foreign projects, he said.
Jayawardena also disclosed that his company, Melstacorp PLC, paid over Rs. 65 billion as taxes last year. Future governments must ensure that relief be granted to people who are struggling for life. Unfortunately there seem to be little or no time to address their issues.
Having introduced the Business Today Passionate segment in 2017, the organizers also honored four enterprising business leaders for their continued investment in the countrys future and confidence in the economy.
The Business Today TOP 30, 2017-2018 and Business Today Special Recognition award ceremony was held under the patronage of Chief Guest, Maithripala Sirisena, President of Sri Lanka. The event was also graced by Venerable Galboda Gnanissara Thero, Chief Incumbent of the Gangaramaya Temple.

Commercial Bank of Ceylon once again ranked at Number Three, reflecting decades of consistent growth. Diversification and a growing regional presence ensured Lanka Orix Leasing Company retained its position at Number Four. Steady progress and capitalization on opportunity ensured Sampath Bank climbed to Number Five. Consolidating its position as the converged communications leader, Dialog Axiata ranked at Number Six. Ceylinco Insurance raised five positions to Number Seven, with a performance propelled by diverse business sectors.
A momentous operating year saw Melstacorp retain its position at Number Eight. Central Finance Company climbed to Number Nine with a strong performance through diversification. A robust balance sheet with greater investment drove Vallibel One eight positions to Number Ten.
Acknowledging the contribution made by visionary individuals to the economy, this year, Business Today also presented Special Recognition to four eminent individuals.

Hemas Holdings operating profit up by 22.5%
Hemas Holdings PLCs recorded consolidated revenue of Rs.30.0 billion for the first six months ended September 30, 2018, a year-on-year (YoY) growth of 33.0% driven by our recent acquisition of Atlas and our healthcare sector.
Group operating profit stood at Rs.2.4Bn, a growth of 22.5% over the previous financial year. Operating profit growth resulted from stronger performance in our home and personal care segment in Sri Lanka and the contribution by Atlas, Chief Executive Officer, Steven Enderby.
The profit attributable to equity holders of the parent at Rs.1.5 billion is a YoY growth of 4.3%. The lower growth in earnings is due to increasednet interest expense post utilisation of cash reserves to acquire Atlas in January 2018, higher working capital due to strong revenue growth in pharmaceutical distribution and the loan financing for our new logistics park. Excluding the first six months performance of Atlas, HHL recorded consolidated revenue and operating profit growth of 16.1% and 2.3% correspondingly.
Our consumer business recorded revenue of Rs.12.2 billion, indicating a YoY growth of 57.7%. Revenue growth in the consumer sector excluding Atlas stood at 8.2%. Operating profit of Rs.1.5 billion grew by 54.3% during the first six months compared to last year.
Our Bangladesh business still continues to experience challenges where intense competition in a weak market environment has resulted in revenue growth of only 1.4% during the first six months of the financial year 2018-19.
Consolidated healthcare sector revenue for the first six months under review stood at Rs.13.4Bn, a YoY increase of 27.3% while operating profit and earnings indicated a decline of 8.3% and 12.6%.
Hemas pharmaceutical distribution operation registered strong revenue growth. However, the impact of price regulation and significant currency depreciation continues to compress margins.
Hemas Hospitals achieved an overall occupancy of 57%, with revenues and profitability improvingsignificantly during Q2 compared to the first three months of the financial year and over last year.
Hemas Leisure, Travel and Aviation (LTA) interests achieved revenues of Rs.1.8 billion, reflecting a growth of 16.7% for the six months under consideration.

HIV cases the highest in 2017
The highest number of HIV infections in the Sri Lankan history (285) was reported last year (2017), Consultant Epidemiologist attached to the National STD/AIDS Control Programme said.
He was speaking at a health media seminar at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo yesterday.
Consultants at the seminar said every week, around six new HIV infections are being detected in Sri Lanka and the estimated number of HIV infected persons in Sri Lanka is around 4,200. One-third of them do not know that they are HIV positive. The new HIV infected persons detected in the country are between the ages 15 and 49.
Female sex workers and their clients, men who have sex with men (homosexuals), drug users who use contaminated needles and syringes, prison inmates, beach boys, transgender persons, TB patients, external migrants, members of the armed forces, police, and workers in the tourism industry are in the high-risk category of getting infected with the disease and they need to get their blood tested for HIV on a regular basis.
During the window period (less than two weeks after infection), HIV can be transmitted to another person without detection and knowledge, because only sensitive tests such as antigen detecting test can detect the virus in blood.
About 40 percent to 90 percent of people have flu-like symptoms two to four weeks after HIV infection. Other people do not feel sick at all during this stage. Flu-like symptoms can include fever, chills, rash, night sweats, muscle aches, sore throat, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, mouth ulcers, they said.

How higher US interest rates  hurt the Indian economy
In 2018-19, FIIs sold stocks worth 55,935 crore and debt securities worth 52,823 crore, explaining why the stock market has fallen and interest rates are up. Graphic: Mint
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the monetary policy committee of the US Federal Reserve, in its latest meeting that ended on 8 November, decided to keep interest rates unchanged. The federal funds rate will continue to be in the range of 2-2.25%.
In the aftermath of the financial crisis, which started when Lehman Brothers went bust in September 2008, the US Fed launched an easy money policy. This included pushing the federal funds rate towards 0% and printing and pumping money into the financial system to keep overall interest rates low.
The idea was that at lower interest rates people would borrow and spend money, businesses would borrow and expand and growth would be back. This happened, but to a limited extent. Since 2015, FOMC has raised interest rates eight times. It is expected to do so three times in 2019.
The easy money policy of the US Fed was followed by other Western central banks as well. This led to big financial institutions borrowing money in the Western markets at low interest rates and investing it in financial markets (both stock and debt markets) all over the world. With interest rates in the US rising, this arbitrage has started to unravel. As interest rates rise, financial investors will withdraw the money they invested in stock and debt markets around the world. This will lead to falling markets and rising interest rates.
The US Federal Reserve printed around $3.5 trillion in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. It has now started to gradually withdraw that money.
With the US Fed raising rates and withdrawing printed money, low rates in the US and the Western world, which led to a flood of money into India, are on their way out. Between 2009-10 and 2017-18, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) invested 6.62 trillion in buying Indian stocks and 3.93 trillion in buying Indian debt. This led to the stock market rallying and low interest rates. The stocks that comprise the BSE Sensex had an average price-to-earnings ratio of 23.8 in 2017-2018, the highest since 2000-2001.
In 2018-19, FIIs sold stocks worth 55,935 crore and debt securities worth 52,823 crore, explaining why the stock market has fallen and interest rates are up. When foreign investors sell they get paid in rupees. They need to convert these rupees into dollars. This pushes up the demand for dollars and the rupee loses value against it. India will continue to face this risk over the next few years.

When the case was taken up before the Panadura Provincial High Court in 2013, lawyer Sri Kanthan appearing for the first accused called upon the court to hold a voire dire inquiry into the confession made to the ASP Panamaldeniya by the first accused.
He stated that the first accused had not made a voluntary confession to the ASP, but that the police had forcibly obtained his signature on the document.
The court decided to hold a voire dire inquiry into the alleged confession summoning ASP Panamaldeniya and other officers who conducted the investigations and recorded the confession of the first accused.
In evidence, police officers told court that the first accused made a voluntary confession to ASP Panamaldeniya after his arrest.
The first accused giving evidence before court denied that he made a voluntary confession to the ASP Panamaldeniya.
At the end of the inquiry, Senior State Counsel Madawa Tennakoon in his submissions told court that the first accused had made a voluntary confession to ASP Panamaldeniya and his confession had been filed with the case records to be taken as evidence in respect of the case.
Attorney-at-law Sanjaya Bandara appearing for the first accused told court that the first accused had not made a voluntary confession to the ASP regarding the Katubedda Claymore mine explosion which occurred in 2008. The alleged confession was a statement to fabricate a case against the two suspects involved in the case.
The judge, after recording the submissions of the Senior State Counsel Tennakoon and the defence counsel Bandara, postponed the order for November 27.
The two accused who were produced in court under heavy guard by prison officials were remanded by the judge till November 27.

INTERIM ORDER ON  general  election
The Supreme Court three-judge-Bench headed by Chief Justice Nalin Perera yesterday, unanimously issued an Interim Order staying the operation of the Gazette notification issued by the President to dissolve Parliament. This Interim Order will be effective until December 7.
The three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court comprising Chief Justice Nalin Perera, Justice Priyantha Jayawardena and Justice Prasanna Jayawardena further issued an Interim Order restraining the Election Commission from proceeding to take any steps to conduct the Parliamentary Election by virtue of the proclamation until December 7.
Taking into consideration the facts presented by all parties, the Supreme Court granted leave to proceed with Fundamental Rights petitions in terms of Article 12(1) of the constitution. Accordingly, 10 petitions filed by various political parties and several individuals were fixed for argument on December 4, 5 and 6.
The petitions were filed by Tamil National Alliance leader R. Sampanthan, UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim, JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress leader Rauff Hakeem, All Ceylon Makkal Congress Party leader Rishad Bathiudeen, R. A. S. D. Perera, Prof. S. Ratnajeevan H. Hoole, MP Mano Ganeshan, Attorney-at-Law Lal Wijenayake, G. C. J. Perera, Attorney-at-Law Aruna Laksiri, Attorney-at-Law Nagananda Kodituwakku and Chamara Sumanapala.
They sought an Interim Order to suspend the proclamation. The Petitioners state that upon the Proclamation being published, the Petitioners were of the view that the Proclamation dissolving Parliament was unconstitutional and illegal.
Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC yesterday, informed Supreme Court that the President has discretionary powers to dissolve Parliament under Article 33(2) and 70 of the Constitution.
Making his oral submissions regarding the Fundamental Rights petitions filed challenging the Presidents decision to dissolve Parliament last Friday, the Attorney General stated that the primary executive powers to dissolve Parliament is vested with the President.
The Attorney General said the President has power to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament in terms of Article 33 (2) (C) of the Constitution.
The Attorney General further submitted to Court that the 19th Amendment to the Constitution in terms of Article 62(2) of the Constitution, has recognized the possibility of dissolution of Parliament even prior to the completion of the five-year period of Parliament.
The Attorney General said Article 70 of the Constitution stipulates the President may by proclamation, summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament.
The Attorney General further submitted to Court that the Supreme Court in its determination regarding the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, had not recognized any ceremonial position for the Presidency.
The President has discretionary powers to dissolve Parliament - that was what happened through the Proclamation, he said.
The Attorney General submitted that the proclamation issued by President has given citizens an opportunity to take a decision at a General Election.
He stated that the President has given reasons for the dissolution of Parliament through a public speech. Even though there are certain limitations under Article 70(1) of the Constitution, the President has discretionary powers to dissolve Parliament on other occasions. There is no limitation of power vested with the President under 19th Amendment to the Constitution. Under the 1978 Constitution, the Ceremonial Presidency was converted to an Executive Presidency. The Presidents power to dissolve Parliament is very clear and unambiguous. This discretionary power is vested in the President, the Attorney General added.
The President acted within the powers of the Constitution and followed the constitutionally mandated process. Any encroachment to this process would violate peoples franchise rights. The Proclamation has been made by the President using constitutional powers to exercise the peoples franchise rights. I move court to dismiss these applications in limine, the Attorney General said.
Meanwhile, Presidents Counsel Sanjeewa Jayawardena appearing on behalf of Prof. G.L. Peiris, an intervenient petitioner submitted to Court that the petitioners cannot seek the Supreme Courts jurisdiction seeking an interpretation through a Fundamental Rights petition. The President resorted to dissolve Parliament since substantial powers are given to him to do so, he added.
Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana appearing for Prof. Channa Jayasumana submitted to Court that the Constitution has given unfettered power to dissolve Parliament at any time.
In response to the intervening petitioners, M.A. Sumanthiran stated that Article 70 and 33(2) cannot be de-linked as suggested. They are intrinsically connected and any interpretation suggesting otherwise is rash and can lead to dire consequences. Meanwhile, a speech that was made by Prof. G.L. Peiris in Parliament on a previous occasion stating that Parliament cannot be dissolved unilaterally before the lapse of four and a half years was quoted in Court by Kanag-Iswaran PC.
Presidents Counsel K. Kanag-Iswaran with M.A. Sumanthiran PC, Thilak Marapana PC, C.J. Weliamuna PC, Dr. Jayampathy Wickremaratne PC, counsel H. Hizbullah and Manjula Balasuriya appeared for the petitioners.
Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC, Solicitor General Dappula De Livera, Additional Solicitor General Indika Demuni de Silva PC, Nerin Pulle DSG and Dr. Avanthi Perera SSC appeared for the Attorney General.

Kicking the deadly drug habit
The Kandakadu and Senapura Drug Rehabilitation Centres in the Polonnaruwa District are an ambitious endeavour, not only as a solution to prison congestion and ridding addicts of the drug habit, but also to benefit the offender who will, at the end of the rehabilitation period, be equipped with life skills which could be productively used. It will also mitigate the risk of these petty offenders returning to society as hard-core criminals.
Having gone through the first six months of their rehabilitation process at the Kandakadu Rehab Centre (featured in the Daily News yesterday), where the main focus is on helping them heal mentally and spiritually and building their self-confidence, they are then transferred to the Senapura Centre where they will receive life skills that will help them find employment the rehabilitation is complete and they are ready to be re-integrated into society.
In this regard, they will receive the NVQ Level 111 certification which will make it easier for them to get into the workforce. These young men undergo vocational training in the fields of carpentry, computer programming, plumbing and so on. It is always not just routine work and meditation and counselling sessions. These men are also given the opportunity to relax and even engage in music which is also a form of therapy. It is amazing to see how talented these young men are and it would have been a shame to allow them to waste their talents and their lives by being addicted to drugs and eventually spending their lives in and out of prison.
Most of these inmates suffer from various illnesses which they realise only after they have stopped taking drugs. Among these drug rehabilitants are also those who have socially transmitted diseases and all of them are assigned separate billets while strict measures are taken to prevent any sexual activity.
Throughout the night, from 10 pm to 7 am, the next morning, the staff members on duty constantly visit the billets of the rehabilitants. No room has been left for even the duty officers to shirk their responsibility as throughout the night they have to visit the billets and record all the details in a log book.
The commitment of the staff at both these centres is highly commendable. Despite Maj. Nandasiri living just 20 minutes away from the rehabilitation centre, he is committed to his task and only goes home once in 28 days when he gets leave. In addition to their drug addiction, there are others who also have been charged for rape, murder and other anti-social activities. Hence, sometimes there are violent confrontations and fights which the staff have to handle carefully. Sometimes they may even try to intimidate the staff members and they have to act in a very tactful manner. This is not hard for them as they are trained counsellors and know how to handle them. There are also two of the drug rehabilitants who have been tested positive for HIV and they are constantly monitored and given the needed treatment by the medical staff.
During the visit by the Daily News to the Senapura Centre, we were fortunate to witness a ceremony where a group of drug rehabilitants had completed their rehabilitation process and were being united with their families.
Going home
Addressing the gathering, the Deputy Commissioner General of Rehabilitation, Brigadier Dharshana Liyanage said after the war ended in 2009, around 12,700 ex-LTTE combatants were rehabilitated at these facilities. Thereafter, the decision was taken to transform these facilities to rehabilitate the thousands of drug addicts who would otherwise end up serving time in prisons, which does nothing to address their drug issues. Although we had to face criticism initially, we were determined as we were confident that we could take on the task of rehabilitating these addicts just as effectively as we rehabilitated the ex-combatants. We commenced the drug rehabilitation programme in 2013 with just 21 addicts. Today, we have around 1,500 of them at Kandakadu and Senapura. The growing numbers are not a good thing, but if we can prevent most of them from going back to drugs, then we have achieved our objective.
We also intend to expand this service to other districts as well. Once these men are rehabilitated and reunited with their families, we dont wash our hands off and think that our job is done. We have a very effective follow-up programme where we regularly check up on them to ensure they dont relapse. Once they return to society, they can always come to us for guidance on employment, training or any other personal matter and we are always ready to assist them, he said, adding that the staff at these centres take a personal interest in all those who come here seeking assistance to kick the drug habit. According to Brig. Liyanage, the monthly consumption of heroin in the country is around 1,000 kg.
A father of one of the youth undergoing the rehabilitation programme, Wickramage, made an emotional appeal to his son and all those who are addicted to drugs to never let this drug scourge take over their lives and ruin them and their families. He spoke of the pain and devastation drugs caused his family. His son who was married and has a young child, had been a bright student, but because of bad influence had got hooked on drugs. I never thought that one day I would be addressing a gathering where my son was at a drug rehabilitation centre. We as parents are still very sceptical, but we have great hope because every time I got the opportunity to visit my son, I have seen a big change in him. However, only over time can we be certain our children have kicked the drug habit for good. I have faith in this facility as they are very strict and dont allow anything to be brought in from out. Even when we come in they check us thoroughly. I must say that while our children have been institutionalised at this facility, remember that even your parents have been institutionalised with you, although we are at home. We love our children very much and I dont know if we have failed in our parenting that our children have ended up in this state. But, I earnestly hope that all those undergoing treatment here will take this opportunity and take responsibility for their lives and kick this habit. Although, you have ended up this way, we as parents still love you very much, he said fighting the tears that rolled down his face.
One of the youth being rehabilitated at the Senapura Centre, Nimantha Wickramage speaking to the Daily News describing the manner in which he got hooked on drugs, said his habit started during his O/L exams at age 15 and continued until he was sent to this facility at 29. My wife has suffered a lot because of my addiction and I cannot describe the pain I have put my parents through. I was a Navy sailor, but I left the Navy because of my addiction. I spent most of my earnings on my addiction and had basically nothing to look after my wife and child with. I hope to find a job when I get out, since I have stayed absolutely clean over the past year.
Nipuns story
Nipun had been addicted to heroin at a very young age and as the youngest in the family, his mother never believed that her son was hooked on drugs. I found out only very recently that my son was addicted to drugs. I was blinded by my love for my son and I never believed that he had got into such a mess. I love him so much. When I see my son and the other children here, I am amazed as when my son was at home, he never even washed a cup at home, but here they are so disciplined and calm. This centre and the military staff have really changed these boys and I am so happy to see them so disciplined and clean, said Nipuns mother. Nipun said he would really try his best to stay clean as he realises how much pain he had caused his mother and despite all what he had done, she never gave up on him. I know I have hurt her so much and done immense wrong. I want to change that and the only way I can seek forgiveness from my mother is by staying clean and taking care of her as she has done for me.
All about routine
Yasitha (28) hails from a well-to-do family and was educated at an international school in Colombo. After his O/Levels, he got a job and later obtained a degree as well. However, his parents had split up and he had been living by himself and later started working for Emirates in Dubai. Due to bad company, he got hooked to cocaine, LSD and eventually, heroin, and then was deported as he got caught with 20g of cocaine.
After he returned, he got a place to live and got a job at a travel centre. However, he started using heroin again and the police placed him here through the courts. Im very happy that after I came here for one year. I have not even had a cigarette. The physical training has also made be physically stronger. The main reason that I got into drugs is that I was basically by myself and there was no one to guide me. I had lost contact with my parents. The authorities got in touch with them and they promised to come and see me. Sadly, they did not come, but I hope they will come tomorrow to see me. However, after this treatment, now I have learnt to love myself and I am confident that when I get out of here, I will be able to get a job and I will get the chance to start life over.
The Centres Director Col. Azad Izadeen said that when these drug addicts first arrive, they dont want to stay and try to get out. However, as time passes, they get used to the routine and once they know they have no choice but to stay sober, they start seeing life in a whole new manner. He said the Dangerous Drugs Control Board also plays a big role in this endeavour. He said they have the capacity to accommodate around 3,000 drug addicts, but it costs around Rs. 4 billion to construct all the required facilities. However, there is a significant increase in the number which is sent here for rehabilitation and around 250 are sent to this centre per month. According to Col. Izadeen, there are around 70,000 to 80,000 drug addicts in Sri Lanka and the hope is to rehabilitate all of them.

A kindling journey
Can we be like drops of water falling on the stone
Splashing, breaking, dispersing in the air
Weaker than the stone by far,
But be aware that as time goes by,
The rock will wear away
And the water comes again
These lines, it is recorded, had been uttered initially by a Taoist Chinese prophet named Lao Tzu. But as times went by, several others tried to recreate the same in their own expression.
Several years ago, I came across a poetic playlet written by Bertolt Brecht titled as Journey of the Prophet, where I read the same lines in a different manner that ran as follows.
When a gust of water flows for some time, over a rugged stony slab, the ruggedness gradually wanes off. As such, get to know that a salient latent power line in the eternal flow of water, mild and calm.
Acts of kindness
I recalled all this, when I reread a certain book written by a psychologist named Lois P Frankel. The book contains about 100 such lines culled from various sources titled as Kindling the Spirit published in 1995.
The subtitle runs as Acts of Kindness and words of courage for women. But on reading the pages, one sees that the words could apply equally to any other gender irrespective of any difference in age and discrimination.
The writer cum compiler of the work mentioned has devoted at least 20 years in the collection process. The intention is laid down as follows:
As Anan Freud said, it is the good, capable, conscientious woman who is more likely to be depressed than her counterparts. Then she adds, that paradoxically, the woman who does so much for other creates her own drepression and has little energy left to spend on herself. As the compilation had grown up, the writer Frankel, who is a woman dedicated to help others had innermost feeling of sharing her expressions from various sources with other women. As a result, read from wherever you like, came to be the guiding epithet. Prior to the publication of the work, Frankel had the experience writing her first book titled as Women, Anger and Depression. Perhaps the interest shown on this work is the outcome of the compilation, which of course is not a sequel to the former.
Frankel adds her own brief interpretation to each of her collection of sayings, dictums, maxims and poetic expressions. Let us take a few out of them that goes as follows:
Healing power
Life appears to me too short to e spent in nursing animosity or registering wrong, said Charlotte Bronte.
Frankel states: Let people know when theyve hurt you so that you can heal sooner. (145 pp)
Helen Keller said:
I seldom think about my limitations and they never make me sad. Perhaps there is justa touch of yearning at times, but it is vague, like a breeze among flowers.
These words are interpreted by Frankel as: When you turn out lights tonight rest well with the knowledge that who you are is truly enough  you need not be anything gmore.
The compiler Frankel inserts a saing of the French writer Nathalie Sarraute as follows:
We are swallowed up only when we are willing for it to happen.
Frankel adds: Decide consciously what you want to do rather than taking the path of least resistance,
Unwanted stress
A reader may feel, perhaps a meditative mood creeps into his/her mind. This may kindle a light to dispel the darkness which causes unwanted stress and strain. Over the years, our teachers have taught us that good words matter and good deeds matter. But how have you perceived the utterance of good words How have you acted in the performance of good deeds
Frankel attempts to show the path transcending from the mere barriers of positive thinking that has come to stay almost like a catchphrase in common parlance. Frankel says at the outset: Resolve to engage in one act of self-kindness each and every day of the year. Frankel develops her interpretation by a quote that goes as follows.
If women were convinced that a day off or an hour of solitude was a reasonable ambition, they would find a way of attaining it. As it is, they feel so unjustified in their demand that they rarely make the attempt.
Do not follow the path may lead. Go instead, where there is no path and leave a trail is yet another quote to which Frankel adds her interpretation as follows:
Forging path
Break out of the boundaries that have been circumscribed for you through birth, race, gender or age, and forge your own path.
Summing up her function, Lois Frankel comes out with a profound conclusion: My writing always begins with the desire to help others and results in my being helped as much as I hope the reader is kindling the spirit are no different.
I found myself taking more time to actually engage in the activities I suggested in their book and thinking more about what I could do for myself that would replenish my well.
The underlying factor in these book look like to me a series of religious thought and spiritual jottings that could be put to practice if one could calm down and concentrate.

Two enforced changes in Lankan team:
Lakmal promises turnaround performance on turning Pallekele pitch
PALLEKELE, Tuesday  Contrary to the notion that Pallekele International Stadium is best suited to suit seam bowlers because of the cool climatic conditions, the pitches prepared for the Test matches played here so far tells you quite a different story.
Left-arm spinner Rangana Herath who retired from international cricket at the end of the first Test at Galle is the leading wicket-taker at Pallekele with 20 wickets (avg. 14.80) from 3 Tests and following him is Lakshan Sandakan, who bowls left-arm chinaman with 12 wickets (avg. 19.91) from 2 Tests.
In fact the top five wicket-takers at Pallekele are spinners. The most wickets a fast bowler has taken is 6 by Australias Ryan Harris in 2011 and Pakistans Junaid Khan in 2012.
Thus Englands hopes of playing both James Anderson and Stuart Broad their two key fast bowlers in addition to the left-arm pace of Sam Curran could change, and they could stick to the combination they had at Galle  two quicks and three spinners.
One neednt venture too far to predict the nature of the pitch that is being prepared for todays second Test for Sri Lankas stand-in captain Suranga Lakmal said it all in one sentence: Weve asked for a pitch that favours the spinners, and I think thats basically what we have got here.
Because the pitch is a turner, what were talking about right now is playing just one seamer. Though we havent chosen the team yet - that decision will come late in the day, Lakmal said.
Circumstances have anyway made Sri Lanka two enforced changes with skipper Dinesh Chandimal being ruled out of the series with a groin strain and Herath retiring.
Instead of Chandimal weve got Roshen Silva and Charith Asalanka in the squad. We havent decided which of those will play, but it will be one of them. For Rangana weve got Lakshan Sandakan and Malinda Pushpakumara. We havent picked between them either. Well make that decision tonight, said Lakmal. We havent thought much about other changes. To a large extent its those two changes that were looking to make.
Sandakan with his better track record on this ground holds an advantage over left-armer Pushpakumara.
IMPROVED BATTING
Lakmal is confident that the batsmen will put up a better performance than they did at Galle where they were dismissed for totals of 203 and 250 and only former captain Angelo Mathews made any sort of contribution by scoring back to back fifties.
As a team weve talked about the batting a lot over the last few days. Weve prepared a plan, and we worked hard on it. I think because of that well be able to play better here than we did in the first Test, said Lakmal.
Everyone - batsmen, bowlers and fielders are trying to give their best for the team. Unfortunately over the recent past we havent got what we expected from the batsmen. But we can change that in this match. No one goes to the middle trying to make a low score. Im trusting that a lot of things will change in this Test, he said.
Lakmal didnt want to delve too much into what has gone wrong with the Lankan batting but said, I cant talk about that much because weve got a batting coach who looks into that. What Id say as a captain or vice-captain is that we need to bat positively. Thats one thing we can do. If you get a good ball, any batsman can get out. Think about that and go to the middle with the intention of scoring runs. Have a positive body language. Thats what I expect from our players.
Questioned how spinner Akila Dananjaya was taking up the reporting of his bowling action by the umpires, Lakmal replied, The umpires have taken that decision, but Dananjaya can play in this game. I talked to him and said dont worry about anything - just focus on this game. Im sure he will get cleared for the next match. Hes bowled well in the past and he has to do that again. Getting reported is just another thing. Forget that and bowl well in this game.
Theres no firm decision on when he is to be tested. He can play in this game, and maybe hell have to go while the next match is on. Hes got 14 days. Dananjaya who bowls a variety of deliveries, Lakmal said he has been reported for his off-spin.
Lakmal is confident that the team can lift itself from being 0-1 down in the series and compete on even terms with England.
Just because we lost a match we havent fallen psychologically. No matter what, we are still playing at home. Just because weve lost a game, that doesnt mean were mentally low. This is a vital match for us because weve got to stay in the series, said Lakmal. The stuff happening around the team - like the change in manager - is out of our control as players. Our job is to do what we can to win on the field. Thats how I want to take my team forward.
It was under Lakmals captaincy that Sri Lanka who were trailing West Indies 0-1 in the three-Test series in the Caribbean levelled it by winning the third and final Test at Barbados. Sri Lanka will have to do a repetition of that performance if they are to keep the series alive.

Lamudi Sri Lanka Launches Property Guide Page
Lamudi Lanka Private Ltd, the premier online real estate marketplace in Sri Lanka, has recently launched a Property Guide page, as a part of the companys efforts to increase understanding about the Sri Lankan property market.
The page can be accessed through the URL,https://www.lamudi.lk/Buyers-Guide/ and provides an extensive guide for property buyers, sellers and local landlords. It focuses on the most common questions asked about buying, selling or renting a property in Sri Lanka.
With this new guide the company hopes to close a critical knowledge gap, and allow real estate stakeholders to take more informed decisions when buying, selling or renting a property.
The page is built with simplicity in mind and is organised under a few main topics. Further information can be accessed through the subtopics.
Property buyers who navigate to the guide can come across important topics such as; things to consider when buying a home, aspects of financing you need to consider before buying or how to best negotiate when buying, Anne Hermans, Regional Head South Asia said.
As well, sellers can expect a wide selection of resources that detail the appropriate selling process of a property. For example;how to evaluate the true market price of your property, how to boost the value of your property to attract the best offers or should you or should you not hire a real estate agent to sell your property.
Landlords can expect vital information under subjects deposits, tenancy agreements or lease agreements. Other articles that focus on ending or extending a short-hold tenancy and, insurance options for landlords can be helpful in order to maintain a smooth interaction with the legal tenants.
The new property guide from Lamudi is a result of substantial research done by the company that is combined with years worth of experience in the real estate sector, to bring the latest and up to date information related to the conduct of real estate that is in line with international standards.
Lamudi considers it a vital part of its existence to provide the latest facts and data to local real estate stakeholders, and aims to help relevant parties to upgrade their business strategies as sellers or landlords, and, to improve search and location of properties for prospective tenants or buyers.
The strength of this guide mainly relies on two factors. Firstly, all information provided is accessible from a single location, saving time and money. Second, the information is objective, and from reputed sources.
Researching online can get a bit chaotic at times. With this guide, our goal is to increase the access to correct and detailed information, said Hermans.
While this can save both time and money for first time buyers, sellers and tenants, it can also be a comprehensive resource for real estate agents, particularly those who are new to the industry, and try to understand the fine art of facilitating a real estate deal.

A 30-year-old Sri Lankan man living in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), charged with two counts of murder after pouring acid on his 23-year-old wife and her boyfriend, claimed he didn't mean to kill her.
The man said that he acted on impulse and had been overcome with jealousy.
His wife died after being transferred to Al Qasimi hospital, while her boyfriend succumbed to his burn injuries after a few months.The case dates back to December 2017.
The Sri-Lankan national - identified as Prishni - was arrested at the airport while waiting for his flight to flee the country.
The woman - identified as PI and her boyfriend identified as Pradeep. K - were reportedly being intimate when the accused threw acid on them.
The husband told the police that he could never imagine that his wife would cheat on him, as they have had a long courtship before they got married. However, he started feeling that his wife's behaviour had changed.
According to him, he traveled to his home country for family business which required him to stay there for around 20 days.
However, one week after having reached there, while browsing the Facebook, he spotted a photograph of his wife with another man. He decided not to call her and immediately flew back to Dubai, the man said. He added that he stayed in a hotel and started monitoring the movements of his wife and her boyfriend.
He followed them when they entered an apartment while leaving the door open.
The man said that he then entered the apartment, went straight into the bedroom and threw acid on them while they were indulged in love-making.
A witness to the incident, who lived in the apartment where the crime took place, said the wife would usually come there every week with her boyfriend.
On that fateful day, she had seen the victim's husband follow the wife and her boyfriend into the room.
The accused confirmed that he had never seen the boyfriend nor met him till the day he threw acid on him.

Leftists, Progressives should join hands - FSP
Frontline Socialist Party Propaganda Secretary Pubudu Jayagoda requested all Leftists and progressive organizations to get together to find a solution to the present crisis in the country.
He made this request at a press conference held at the Party Office in Battaramulla on Monday.
He said the election that has been called has taken a violent mode and therefore, it could claim the lives of innocents. One such incident was reported from the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation recently, he said.
He pointed out that the present political crisis has a link to the economic crisis. Due to this political instability, there is an effect not only on the investments, but also on business opportunities with the entire world.
He said that the people who voted for the unity government in 2015 had an expectation on democracy. But, this expectation has been betrayed. Therefore, they need a third option. To make it a reality, the people who struggle for education, health, labour, fertilizer subsidy, water, lands, and harbour have to get together.
Lets make a common platform for democracy. It cannot be achieved separately. We need a force of the people. Therefore, all Leftists and progressive factions should get together and create a broad front for democracy, he said.
Jayagoda said their party has still not taken a decision to contest the election.We are still discussing with our supporting factions and will announce our stance in the future, he added.

A letter to my son who passed the Scholarship Exam
My dearest son,
Tears of joy flooded from my eyes when the news reached my ears that you have passed the Grade Five Scholarship Examination. It was indeed a good sign of your long journey which you conquered out of much commitment and hard work. I know quite well how you kept away your playful childhood and carried out that rigorous course both day and night to reach your target. Though your mother and I knew it was a crime to forget your innocence, steal your play time and rest and so on, we had to do so even unwillingly as the only thing we could afford to do for your future was nothing else but to provide you with a sound education.
Dear son, through various types of mass media we could hear and witness children of your age, who had obtained very high marks at the examination talking of their future ambitions in such a triumphant mood, which I think will be a firm foundation for their future orientations.
Dear son, I know what your dream too is in this complex and fast-moving world. It is a great ambition, a noble thought to be a physician indeed, whose smiles and comforting words can have a healing power upon the sick. And also a noble profession which can bring back fife, smiles and hope to the dying souls from various sicknesses. A physician is a God visible who can be kept at a point of veneration for the incredible miracles performed by transplanting hearts, kidneys, and so on.
Dear son, I know your little head is still not matured enough to make firm decisions. Yet, if your sole intention is to be a physician one day, I presume you need to bear these thoughts in your mind right now as the seeds of these thoughts can become a tree laden with fruit which even a violent storm cannot shake and harm.
Forget not my dear son that it is public money from which you receive your education and you are indebted forever to repay that through a genuine service to your motherland. Secondly, forget not the cries and pain of the helpless patients when your help becomes urgent and essential. Listen to them and treat them kindly as most of them may be in a struggle between life and death and never keep their lives at a risk demanding your rights and privileges of any sort.
Today certain professions have turned out to be money generating machines. You may question one day that you too need money to lead a good life - building a mansion, possessing a luxurious vehicle, foreign tours and what not. Perfectly you are correct my son, but at the same time, remember that there is no end to human desires and cravings.
The more you get the more need you will have. Therefore, the satisfaction of what you get and managing it in a righteous manner will bring you happiness and a long healthy life, for which no medicine can be prescribed. That happiness travels through the blood blessing not only you but also your children parents . too. You will be a great man my dear son when taking the Hippocratic Oath, which tells the most righteous way for a physician to be honoured among all men for all time to come and remember. The violation of this noble oath, remember, will bring the very opposite consequences of all this.
Therefore, my son, I fathered you, fed you and brought you up with hard earned money and try my best to help you find your place in society. Your mother and I may not be alive to witness your success but remember, even without the stethoscope you should be able to feel and hear the heartbeat of the innocent people who come to you. Be kind and do not market and sell the dignity of your noble service for monetary gains. You may be poor and may die poor, yet, you will have no worries other than happiness and self-satisfaction which money can never buy.
Finally, I wish you wholeheartedly to realize your dreams. But, I cant make predictions in such a way in this world. What I request you are  make sure only knowledge, status, reputation, money will never make you a successful person, but you need to mix and remix positive attitudes, virtues and skills and be productive and a useful citizen in whatever the field you hope to strive.
Your loving father
A Jayalath Basnagoda

Macron advisor says Trump tweets written  for Americans
An advisor to Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday dismissed a flurry of angry tweets from US President Donald Trump about his French counterpart, saying they were written for Americans.
Macron's office declined to officially comment on the tweets, which come two days after Trump was Macron's guest at World War I centenary commemorations in Paris.
In the tweets, Trump criticises Macron's calls for closer EU defence integration, mocks his low approval ratings and attacks EU tariffs on US wine.
One of Macron's advisors brushed the tweets aside, saying they were written for Americans -- otherwise they would not be written in English.
It's not for us to comment on content meant for his citizens, said the advisor, declining to be named, adding that relations between Macron and Trump were not always easy but are enduring.
He pointed out that the pair had held talks during Trump's trip to Paris last weekend for World War I centenary commemorations, during which they attempted to defuse the row over defence.
Donald Trump was among the first to arrive in Paris, where he reserved his first meeting for President Macron. These gestures have much greater value than tweets -- we know how and why they're written, the advisor added.
Beyond tweets, what matters is that they speak several times a week about issues affecting the direction of the world. Trump had launched a first broadside against Macron on arriving in Paris last weekend, labelling the French president's call for a real European army, and his characterisation of the United States as a potential security risk, as insulting. - AFP

Certain places of religious worship and construction sites had become an obstacle to control dengue in the Galle district, District Health Services Director Dr. Chandima Sirithunga said at the district dengue control committee meeting recently.
According to field surveys carried out by his unit, almost 41 percent of the mosquito breeding grounds were found at places of worship. Mosquito breeding sites were also found in most construction sites.
They have found empty curd pots and containers strewn in the backyards of most places which remain unattended.
The Shasanarakshaka Bala Mandalayas had been informed about this problem and they should educate dhamma school authorities and dayaka sabhas and obtain their assistance in eradicating the dengue menace.

Musings on SLs first Professor of Tamil
Jeevanathi Publications in Yaalpaanam has published a few booklets covering Tamil Personalities in the Universities. They are written by Eelak Kavi (A H M Nawas), a teacher, writer and a literary critic from the Uva Province. The booklets are excellent and comprehensive accounts of the great scholars in Lankan Universities.
One of such professors is the first professor in Tamil not only in the then University of Ceylon but also the first ever Tamil professor in any university. He was Swami Vipulananda.
Ramakrishna Mission
Born on March 27, 1892, first as Thambipillai and later to be called Mylvaaganam by his parents, Saamithamby and Kannammai from Kaaraitheevu in the Eastern Province, he joined the Ramakrishna Mission as Swami Vipulananda.
Achieving academic qualifications and gaining experience as a teacher, he renounces the worldly life in Chennai (1924) and becomes Swami of the Ramakrishna Mission.
Upon his recommendation, the famous Annamalai University in Chidambaram in Thamilakam was established. He was requested to be its first Professor in Tamil in 1931. He worked there for two years.
First Tamil professor
In 1943, he was appointed as the first professor in Tamil in the then University of Ceylon.
One who knows Tamil should read this book to go into the depth of information that the Writer Eelak Kavi elaborates. I cannot translate this book into English at this juncture.
From page 1 to the first quarter of page 25 the writer compiles the quotations of others who have given their impressions on Swami Papulacandin and his works adding his own comments, more than 45 citations are there.
But the irony is none of my statements on the great scholar and his works are cited. I was the first to identify Swami Vipulananda as the first Tamil Literary critic in Lanka.
This shows most people don read the articles and books written by lesser-known writers and think it fit to quote only from academics.
Magnum Opus
In the second section, Eela Kavi writes about Swami Vipulanandas Magnum Opus- the Yaarl Nool, a discovery of ancient Tamil musical instrument. The scholars interest in music is substantiated in this booklet. His research on Yaarl lasted nearly 15 years. The book was launched in 1947.
In the third section, the writer speaks about the interests the scholar had on Drama and Theatre. He liked Shakespeare and rendered into Tamil some of the Bars poetry. He wrote a book on Shakespeares work and the nature of drama titled Madanga Soolamani as far as 1926. However, he felt it was not satisfying to him.
Swami Vipulandas comparative studies on Sanskrit and western literature are pioneer works. Eela Kavi has taken pains to illustrate the pioneer works of Swami Vipulananda in elucidating his contribution to the poetry, music and theatre of the ancient Tamils.
In a nutshell, the writer has given the quintessence of the greatest Lankan Tamil scholar, Swami Vipulannda in this handy booklet. Congratulations to him.

Prof. Hoole petitioned the Supreme Court against President Maithripala Sirisenas action of dissolving Parliament to allow people to elect a new Parliament that resonates with their aspirations.
The Election Commissions job is to ensure holding election not to prevent it, the former MP said in his Twittter account.
Where was that election commission member when the previous Government postponed elections multiple times Why did not he go to the Supreme Court then Now, when an election is called he works towards eliminating it, Rajapaksa said.

North Korea hiding missile bases- Study
US: North Korea is operating at least 13 undeclared bases to hide mobile, nuclear-capable missiles, a new study asserted Monday, as progress stalls on US President Donald Trumps signature foreign policy initiative.
Trump has hailed his June summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as having opened the way to the Norths denuclearization, defusing tensions that less than a year ago brought the two countries to the brink of conflict.
Since the summit in Singapore, North Korea has forgone nuclear and missile tests, dismantled a missile test site and promised to also break up the countrys main nuclear complex if the US makes concessions.
But researchers at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington said they had located 13 missile operating bases that had not been declared by the government, and that there may be as many as 20.
Its not like these bases have been frozen, Victor Cha, who leads CSISs North Korea program, told The New York Times, which first reported on the study and headlined its findings as suggesting a great deception by Pyongyang.
Work is continuing, said Cha, who was once in line to be the US ambassador to Seoul. What everybody is worried about is that Trump is going to accept a bad deal -- they give us a single test site and dismantle a few other things, and in return they get a peace agreement. But the South Korean government and analysts played down the report, saying that the facilities had been known about for years and Pyongyang had never offered to give them up.
The bases are scattered across the country in underground facilities tunneled in narrow mountain valleys, according to the CSIS researchers, and designed for mobile missile launchers to quickly exit and move to previously prepared launch sites.
Bases for strategic weapons such as intercontinental ballistic missiles -- whose development is the subject of sanctions -- are located deep inside the country.
Medium-range missiles capable of striking Japan and all of South Korea reportedly are deployed in an operational belt 55 to 100 miles (90 to 150 kilometers) north of the Demilitarized Zone that divides the peninsula.
Shorter-range missiles fit into a tactical belt 30 to 55 miles from the DMZ.
The researchers findings were based on satellite imagery, defector interviews and interviews with intelligence and government officials.
The South Korean government and analysts played down the report, saying there was not much new about the findings.
I dont see a kind of ground breaking or new information really, said Daniel Pinkston, a lecturer at Troy University in Seoul, adding the Sakkanmol site the report highlighted has been known for a long time, for at least 20 years.
Vipin Narang of MIT tweeted: Kim literally ordered ballistic missiles to be mass produced on New Years day 2018.
He never offered to stop producing them, let alone give them up, he added, saying that the characterization of deception is highly misleading.
Theres no deal to violate. The Souths presidential office said intelligence authorities in Seoul and Washington had already been aware of the information in the report and added the Sakkanmol base had nothing to do with inter-continental ballistic missiles.
North Korea never promised to get rid of short-range missiles or to shut down related missile bases, Presidential spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom told reporters.

Pampered pet squirrel
A pampered pet squirrel gets to watch TV, is treated to face masks and enjoys cuddles on the sofa with her rescuer.
35-year-old Christina Reyes has spent two and a half years and 7,700 raising little Thumbelina after she was found in a tenth floor apartment. Thumbelina and another baby were found in a pile of leaves and twigs on a homeowners bed after being left there by their mother.
Christina, who has rehabilitated orphaned squirrels since 2008, rushed over to tend to the tiny animals, then just a few hours old.
Christina and her husband Michael, 37, nursed the squirrels back to health and fed them formula through a syringe.
Sadly one of the babies caught a fever and passed away a few hours later, but Thumbelina  so-called because of her teeny size  pulled through. When the time came to release her into the wild, the couple feared Thumbelina wouldnt survive because she couldnt jump or climb.
Instead, the animal lovers built a bed for the adorable rodent and welcomed her into their lives full time. Now spoilt Thumbelina spends every night cuddling them on the sofa and enjoys human activities such as watching TV, doing face masks and eating avocado.
Christina said the rodent  which wears squirrel-sized hats and glasses  is her baby and best friend.
The fitness instructor, from Mahopac, New York, said, I love Thumbelina so much. My husband and I knew that we never wanted children. Thumbelina is our baby. Shes my little best friend, every day I look forward to spending time with her. When Im feeling low, she comes over and snuggles with me. My family are used to me being an animal person but my husbands family was quite squeamish about it. But now they have come to accept that Thumbelina is our baby. They even send her cards. She is a little troublemaker. She loves to bite a charger, the buttons on a remote, and headphone wires. Shes always trying to get into the refrigerator. She does require a lot of attention.
The couple first met Thumbelina in March 2016 after she was found in a Bronx, New York, apartment.
Christina said, The mother was standing on the window sill, twitching her tail and freaking out because he was touching her babies. She kept bringing in nest building materials but she wasnt taking her babies back. Michael and I knew we had to take them as they were only three hours old and needed to be fed.
After nursing her back to health, the couple named the squirrel Thumbelina because she was so small.
She said, When she was just three days old, my husband cracked open a walnut and said: I bet we can fit her inside the shell. She fitted into it perfectly and reminded us of the Thumbelina fairy tale where the tiny girl slept in a walnut shell cradle.
She added that Thumbelina is not outside squirrel material and needs a lot of TLC.
Christina said, When we tried to introduce her to other squirrel babies, she isolated herself. She curled up into a ball and she wanted nothing to do with them. She walked on the ground, she didnt like to climb or jump, she followed us around. Shes afraid of everything. We brought her to the park and she acted like it was a haunted house. She doesnt like the cold. She just huddles herself into a ball. Shes not outside squirrel material.
Christina has spent around 7,700 on little Thumbelina so far, splashing out 40 a week on her diet of fresh kale, arugula, spinach, snap peas and avocados.
She said, Its a lot of money  its like sending your child to college. But shes worth every cent.
Just last weekend, Thumbelina was wheeled into surgery to have a 1,5000 hysterectomy, leaving Christina racked with worry.
She said, Thumbelina gains weight very quickly. She weighs just over two pounds and really she should be between 1.5 and 1.75.
All her life shes been a little chub with a pot belly. She is on a strict diet of kale, greens and squash and no nuts.
The vet said that her progesterone levels were too high and her little uterus was enlarged so she should have a hysterectomy.
I was hysterical because shes my little baby. Shes so small and there were concerns about anesthesia. I was so afraid to go to sleep. I slept with her next to me. But it all went well.
Christina added that although some people consider squirrels to be rodents, they deserve human care and attention just as much as more conventional pets do.
She said, People see squirrels as dirty rats, but Thumbelina has such a strong, endearing personality. She deserves just as much love and affection as you would give a cat or a dog.

A plea to renovate Rajarata tanks
At a divisional meeting of the farmers held in Pethiyagama in Thambuththegama, the importance of renovating the remaining tanks in the Rajarata area to introduce the ancient irrigation culture to the younger generation of the country was highlighted.
Retired principal and a farmer of the Pethiyagama village, R.B. Abeyratne said that although their generation was knew what a tank was, the younger generation would not know what it is in the future.
Therefore, it is very important to renovate them.
According to him, almost all the tanks in the Mahaweli H Zone were destroyed and later used as paddy fields. However, a few officials who were aware of the importance and the usefulness of the tanks took steps to protect a few.
The Pethiyagama tank is one of them.
R.M.S. Thilakaratne, a farmer from the Pethiyagama, pointing out the importance of the Pethiyagama tank said that there was no Mahaweli project during their childhood.
Therefore, it is the Pethiyagama tank which provided them with water for their needs. We used water from this tank for both Yala and Maha cultivation seasons, he said.
Another farmer of the Pethiyagama village, retired principal Ratnayake said that the Pethiyagoda tank is now filled with mud as it is not cleaned properly.
Therefore, he requested the government to launch a programme to dig this tank and renovate it for the future use.

Polonnaruwa, the suite of Indian dance
The Indian dance influence continuously impressed the sculptural concepts and decorative architectural sculptures of Sri Lanka which could be seen in different art forms including iconography and decorative architectural buildings. Following the Polonnaruwa period, numerous other periods existed in the Sri Lankan history.
The dance impact on sculptures could be obviously seen in the post-Polonnaruwa period building decorations and sculptures especially in the periods of Dambadeniya, Kurunegala, Yapahuwa, Gampola, Raigama, Seethawaka, Kotte, Kandy and Colombo. Among the above mentioned period, Yapahuwa period is considered important for this study because numerous Indian dance related sculptures are seen in the Yapahuwa period.
Ancient glory
Yapahuwa is situated in the Kurunegala district of Sri Lanka. Further, it is located nearly three miles east of Maho. The earlier glory of this ancient citadel could be found at one of the caves and boulder.
This is visibly seen from a short record in Brahmi script. It is stated that Brahmi language was in use from the period of 3rd century B.C to 3rd century A.D. Yapahuwa gained prominence after the first half of the 13th century AD, especially after the Kalinga marauder Magha devastated the capital Polonnaruwa. Kalinga Maghas period was from 1214 to 1235. Earlier Yapahuwa was known as Subha Pabbata. Subha Pabbata means (Subha Mountain).
According to history, during the reign of Vijayabahu 1V (1271-1273A.C) the place was called Sundarapabbata. According to historical evidence, the king Vijayabahu IV commanded his younger brother Bhuvanekabahu to settle there with his strong army to prevent the South Indian invasion. Despite his heavy guard, the attack came from another direction led by Chandrabhanu in co-operation with his Pandya and Chola allies.
Yet numerous historical records reveal Yapahuwa had a long history. In the 16th century history, the Portuguese have mentioned Yapahuwa as the fortress of Sinhalese. The first study of Yapahuwa was done by the civil servant John Bailey in 1850. In 1864 John Bailey published an article on Yapahuwa under the title once a week. On 5th of May 1877, an architect from Anuradhapura mentioned Yapahuwa to Governor W.H Gregory, by indicating that more attention should be paid to it.
Yapahuwa fortification
Again fifteen years later, the Ceylon branch of the Royal Asiatic Society published two articles, one by F.H. Modder and the other by J. Harward under the title Note on the Fortifications of Yapahuwa. Yapahuwa is totally a stone structure. The stone structure has a staircase which is flanked and decorated by two furious stone made lions with attractive porch set against the famed Yapahuwa rock. Till today it is as considered one of the finest ancient archaeological constructions of Sri Lanka during the post-Polonnaruwa period.
The Archaeological Department commenced operations in 1911, H.C. Bell took great interest and pain to protect the monument from destruction and collapse. Today Yapahuwa provides ample evidence for carved ancient sculptures of Sri Lanka. Excellent carved sculptures are seen all over.
Beautiful dance figures are well carved in Yapahuwa. The carved figures including dancing girls, lions, swans and large lion elephants are seen at Yapahuwa. And also it provides an opportunity to compare these dance figures with the poses of Indian classical dances especially with the dancing figures of Chidambaram temple (Chola period dances of Chidambaram temple sculptures).
It resembles the South Indian Cholas sculptures (period sculptures are famous for stone sculptures and stone carving sculptures) and Chola architectural sculptures. However, there is no doubt that it was further modified according to the Sinhalese architecture style and excellent unique Sinhalese craftsmanship. Beautifully carved dancing figures are seen at the staircase.
Female figures
Even Kirti Mukha head of a mythical creature and a pair of Gaja Sinha are seen there. The base of the porch area is decorated with beautiful female figures and male dancing figures. These dancing figures depict numerous dance poses. These carved figures are not only depicting the dance poses but also depict numerous instrumental accompaniments for dance. It implies that during the period dances took place with instrumental music.
It provides an opportunity for us to assume that dancing carved figures reveal some dance procession scene. Actually, the staircase could be divided into three different sections. At the third level, beautiful slender female figures are seen. No doubt the stairways which lead to the porch are well preserved. At both sides, exquisite and excellent craftwork windows were seen.
Such excellent windows are not seen elsewhere in the Lankan archaeological sites. The window in the west was removed a few years back and it was stated that it was brought down to the Colombo Museum. The other was a small fragment window which was taken to one of the Yapahuwa temples.
The size of the window was fitted into a thick outer frame. Within the moulded window, forty-five cut circles were crafted. These cut circles were joined with one another. Within the circles, a variety of figure works was crafted with meticulous care. Different dance figures of dancers were seen.
Lotus figure
Most of these dance figures are seen in typical Bharatha Natya Arimandi Istana position. All the dance poses are seen with a proper and perfect geometrical format position. The centre of this window circle carries a lotus figure. At the sides of the centre lotus circle, four wheels are seen with eight strokes and some circles are decorated with dancing figures. Hence for the dance research, Yapahuwa provides a great deal of information for the researcher.
Following Yapahuwa numerous beautiful dance sculptures and beautiful dance depicted in the stone friezes with typical Karana dance impact could be seen in the sculptures of the Gampola period, Kotte period and Kandyan period.

Quirky candles
A candle is one of the easiest ways to add ambiance to your home. But just because they cast a soft glow in your living room, it doesnt hide the fact that they can look a bit banal. Luckily, there have been some clever candle developments over the past several years and otherwise ordinary balls of wax have been shaped into statement-making pieces for your home.
The Kisa Candle by PyroPet (melting cat candle) was one of the first cool candles to usher in this new era of illumination. When you begin to burn this candle, it seems as though its a solid wax creature. But as it melts, a metal skeleton is slowly revealed. Once the candle is completely spent, you have the skeleton as a peculiar keepsake.
There have since been other candles that are quirkier than average, like a unicorn that cries rainbows or even one that smells and resembles a Froot Loop cereal bowl. So, why settle for your average tea light

Rs. 400 million to develop mushroom farming in Kegalle
The Saemaul Global Foundation of South Korea and the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council have launched a joint programme to propagate mushroom cultivation in the Kegalle District. The South Korean Government has granted Rs. 400 million for the project, Provincial Council's press officer Denzil Weerasuriya said.
The project is already in progress in Pitiyagama, Hewadiwela, and Walpola in Kegalle, he added. Another village would be included in the project which has already enrolled nearly 500 families in the district. Their products would be marketed countrywide under the auspices of a leading commercial firm.
Mushroom co-operative unions would also be established in each village for community empowerment.

When pressed whether he would take on the leadership of the party, he said, from the day I took up UNP membership, from the day I was born, I have been ready for anything, but there is a procedure and method for everything.

Seniors tell UNP leadership: Best led by Sajith than rot with Ranil
The power struggle inside the United National Party continues over who should lead its future course as moves are being orchestrated by some members to stop Ranil Wickremesinghe from running again as the partys leader.
Meanwhile, some members from the UNP-led coalition, the United National Front, including MP Patali Champika Ranawaka said they will form a leadership council to achieve victory in the forthcoming General Election.
Senior UNP members have pointed out to its central working committee that the UNP cannot surmount a challenge at any future election with Wickremesinghe running as leader.
Former UNP Kurunegala District MP Ashok Abeysinghe said the idea of facing an election with a leadership council is good, but incumbent leader Wickremesinghe should not be the one to call the shots in any future elections unless they want to concede defeat.
The forthcoming election is crucial to us. The people in our electorates, our party activists in Kurunegala and other parts of the country have clearly told us that they cannot support the UNP and will not support the UNP, unless Wickremesinghe steps down as UNP leader and give that position to Sajith Premadasa, Abeysinghe said.
We have about 100 UNF members, of them 90 have communicated that the party cannot move forward with incumbent leader Wickremesinghe, who has led UNP for over 25 years, who must relinquish his leadership and pave the way for Sajith Premadasa to lead the party, he said. Asked whether there are other candidates in the UNP who can surmount an election challenge, Abeysinghe said, not as good as Sajith, because he is the one with proper answers for an election race.
He reflects unmatched potential.The party should not be naive again to under-represent Sajith Premadasa, he added, It is best to forward Sajith Premadasa to win future elections for the party than facing defeat under the incumbent leader.

Southern Expressway extension to be ready by 2019
About 75 percent of the construction work on the Southern Expressway extension from Matara to Hambantota, with a length of 96 km, has been completed. It will be vested with the public next year, he said.
Project Director of the Extension of the Southern Expressway Project - Section 4 (Hambantota to Mattala via Andarawewa), A.P.K. Abeydeera said the rest of the work is progressing expeditiously. We are on schedule to finish at the end of 2019, he said.
The Southern Expressway Extension from Matara to Hambantota comprises four main sections including Section 1 - a 30km stretch from Matara to Belliatta; Section 2 - a 26km stretch from Beliatta to Wetiya; Section 3 - a 15km stretch from Wetiya to Andarawewa; and Section 4  a 25km section from Mattala to Hambantota via Andarawewa.
He said about 80 percent of the construction work of the first section has been completed, while the progress of the third and fourth sections are about 85 percent complete.
He said about 60 percent of the construction work on the second section has already been completed and the delay occurred as a result of late commencement of the construction work in the second stage. But the construction work has been expedited in the section.
The estimated cost of the project is Rs. 103.2 billion. The government has signed four loan agreements with the EXIM Bank of China to finance civil work contracts and the construction work on all four sections which is being undertaken without any significant hindrance.
Abeydeera said there are eight interchanges in the Southern Expressway extension which are the Godagama interchange, the Aparekka interchange, the Beliatta interchange, the Kahagalla interchange, the Angunukolapalassa interchange, the Wetiya interchange, the Suriyawewa interchange and the Andarawewa interchange.
The extension initially with four-lane carriageways will be developed as a six-lane expressway later, he added.
The project will provide massive benefits as it will link with the countrys major economic centres such as the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port and Mattala Mahinda Rajapaksa International Airport in the Southern Province with Colombo city and the central part of the country through the Outer Circular Highway and Colombo - Katunayake Expressway.

Stay Order has no effect  on PM, Cabinet
The Interim Order issued by the Supreme Court with regard to the dissolution of Parliament has no effect whatsoever on the appointment of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers, it was stressed yesterday at a news conference convened by several leading members of the Government.
The stay order does not pose any challenge to the appointment and authority of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and other ministers, Megapolis and Western Province Development Minister Dinesh Gunawardena said. He said this was only a temporary injunction and the Supreme Court would only deliver the final verdict on the dissolution on December 7 after hearing further submissions from December 4 to 6. This was the usual practice for this type of petition, he pointed out.
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said they would explore the possibility of seeking a full Bench of the Supreme Court for further hearings. The Stay Order was issued by a three-Judge Bench headed by the Chief Justice.
Housing and Construction Minister Wimal Weerawansa said only the President has the power to reconvene Parliament, although Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has made statements to the contrary. Thus he has no power to reconvene Parliament today (14), he said. Moreover, the power of appointing the Prime Minister and the Ministers lies with the President, not with the Speaker. This is the first time in global history that an opposition party is rejecting elections and going before the Courts. They have already proved that the people are not with them. Showing a majority in Parliament does not equate to having a popular mandate. Attempts are being made with the help of certain countries to show that there is anarchy in Sri Lanka.
Minister Gunawardena clarified that the Stay Order has not nullified the General Election as wrongly believed by many. There is only a Stay Order on the election given until the final ruling is delivered on December 7. Both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Rajapaksa would strive to obtain a bigger mandate from the people at the forthcoming election, he added.

So, you want to start-up and develop a small business  Part 10
Take control of your business from day one by doing first things first
Pilots would never fly from Colombo to Heathrow without a detailed, well-researched flight plan. The flight plan helps them figure out how they will get from one airport to another. It is their blueprint for a successful trip.
Your business plan is your version of a flight plan. It is your blueprint for a successful journey. If you want to take control of your business from day one then you have to do first things first. Creating a business plan is the first thing.
Once completed, your business plan will guide you how to start your business and how to face the obstacles you encounter throughout your journey.
Writing Your Business Plan
How detailed should you make your business plan A simple, more short-term-focused plan (ten pages or so) is adequate if, say, yours is a home-office business and the plan is for your benefit alone. However, if you intend to expand your business, hire employees, or open multiple locations, then your plan should cover the long-term issues more extensively and, thus, be lengthier (say, 20 to 50 pages).
Finally, no matter what size or direction you contemplate for your business, if you intend to use the plan as a tool to look for outside investors or professional lenders, you need to write an even more complete business plan.
Not all business plans need to contain all the parts we are going to describe today and next three weeks. If you plan to give your business plan to outsiders, such as bankers, from whom youre seeking money or some other commitment, you should cover all the following bases.
However long you decide to make your business plan, keep in mind that you can always add to and/or upgrade it to meet your needs. Later on, after youve completed the plan and your business takes off, youll have plenty of opportunities to rewrite and update your plan.
Whether you use our format or adapt one of your own choosing, your business plan should address the issues listed here.
Part 1: Business description
This part provides the reader with an overview of the business. After reviewing this part, the reader should understand exactly what business youre in, what its legal entity is, and how your business intends to differentiate itself from its competitors.
Dont take this challenge lightly; the readers decision to peruse the plan in more depth will depend on his initial reaction to this description.
A. Mission statement - We have studied mission statement in depth last week.
B. Summary of the business - Begin this summary with a one-sentence definition of exactly what your business will do or does. This sentence should be the same to-the-point definition youll ultimately use as your one-minute pitch when explaining your business to everyone from bankers to customers to business acquaintances.
The concept of your business doesnt have to be unique or extraordinary. Electricians, tax consultants, book keepers, and computer consultants will always be in demand. More businesses succeed by being managed efficiently and wisely than by providing a new and unique product or service. If you want your business to really be different, you can put a new twist on a concept that has been around for a while.
Suppose, for example, that youre a veterinarian who recognizes that more than a few people in your area are too busy to bring their pets to your office for treatment. Thus, you may create a new business - say, Vet on Wheels. Or, you also have the option to run your veterinarian business the traditional way (that is, by offering quality services at a competitive price to walk-in customers).
C. Legal description - Is your business a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, Non-Government Organisation etc.
D. Competitive edge - Answer the following questions to clearly communicate how you intend to differentiate your company from your competitors: (a) Who are your competitors, and what (in your opinion) is currently their competitive edge Here you want to identify your competitors strengths so that you can, in the early stages of your business anyway, avoid competing directly against them. (b) What are your competitors weaknesses By identifying their weaknesses, you open the opportunity to take advantage where theyre the most vulnerable.
(c) What will distinguish your products or services from those of your competitors This distinction doesnt have to be something new and unique. Simply doing something better often suffices. (d) Service, quality, or price - which of the three do you intend to emphasize Remember, you cant be all things to all people.
(e) Where do you intend to position your product in the marketplace Do you intend to be the top service and quality provider within your niche, or do you plan to concentrate on the low end of the niche by focusing mainly on price Remember, it is extremely difficult for most small businesses to be the low-cost player. Small businesses should focus on service and quality and leave the low pricing to someone else.
Part 2: Management
The management section is the most important part of your business plan. Intelligent investors recognize that the success or failure of a business hinges on the quality of the management team. Hence, the management section is one of the first places investors look when they pick up your plan. If they arent impressed with the management team, you can rest assured that they wont go any further.
Begin your management section with biographies of the principal members of your business: The Chairman, Directors, CEO or General Manager, sales and marketing managers and so on. Be accurate in outlining their backgrounds and remember that the prudent investor may check references.
As you write the management section, remember that youre selling your management team to the reader; include what makes them special. Pay the most attention to the bio pertaining to the person who makes the most difference to the business - you!
If you use the business plan only as a road map and not as an inducement for investment, the management summary is less important. However, putting the qualifications and employment histories of the major players on paper may help you better think through whether the players fit well together and will make a synergetic and complementary team.
Part 3: Marketing plan
The marketing part of your business plan provides the reader with an overview of the industry in which your business competes, a description of your businesss potential customers, and an explanation of how you intend to sell, distribute, and promote your product or service.
This part of the plan is often the most difficult for companies to complete. Many competing products and services will fall within your niche. The difficulty, of course, is in differentiating and highlighting your products and services to prospective customers and then convincing them to buy them.
The marketing part of your plan will make or break your success in this aspect of the business. Let us see how to write it.
A. The industry at large - In this section, provide an overview of the industry (within the geographical area you expect your business to cover) by answering the following questions: How competitive is the industry What are the growth opportunities Who are the industry leaders Where are the niches in addition to yours
You can usually obtain answers to these questions by reviewing websites, talking to customers, and speaking with people at your industrys trade associations. You can also consult those who are already in specified niches within the industry, such as wholesalers or manufacturers reps.
B. Potential customers - If your business sells to consumers rather than to other businesses, consider gender, age, income, geographic location, marital status, number of children, education, housing situation (rent or own), and the reasons why they may want your product or service. Which of these demographics represent your desired customers Create a profile of how your target market behaves as customers.
Consider what motivates them to buy and how they buy, including whether they rely on recommendations from others: what their product usage-rate tendencies are: when they make their purchases: whether they buy online, on credit, or on impulse.
This target customer profile information will come in handy when youre ready to select the right media advertising vehicle to use. If you sell to businesses (B2B), you need to understand similar demographic issues that relate to them. What types of businesses will buy your products and services Who within those businesses will be the ultimate decision- makers, and how can you reach them What problems of the ultimate decision-makers will you solve with your products or services
Most of the businesses know exactly how to describe the features of their products or services but do not know how to point out the benefits. Todays consumers, particularly the more sophisticated ones, are more interested in hearing about the benefits of your gizmo than in hearing about its features. Youre manufacturing a new electrical coconut scraper, do not tell the potential customer about its dimensions and its horsepower; tell her about what it will do for her that the others wont.
Next week we continue on Business Plan.

Alice @ Wonderland
Timeless inspiration
In a world dominated by Disney and Grimms fairy tales, a few classics still stand out and continue to be made and remade both in its original format as well as with a modern touch. Lewis Carrolls Alices Adventures in Wonderlands charm has not faded with the years as the story has inspired a huge body of work and mediums which are beyond the realm of childrens literature.
It has become a favourite not only among children but also with adults due to its imaginative powers and logic. It has often been considered as one of the finest fantasy work ever penned in literature history.
The story has inspired numerous film and television adoptions and had also been performed live on stage as stage plays. Bringing
Giving the tale a new and contemporary setup by bringing the story to the modern time zone renowned playwright Jonathan Yukich has brought Carrolls creation to the familiar setup in the 21st century. This version aptly titled [emailprotected] Wonderland shows Alice as a typical teenager who is bound to modern technology. She tries to use this knowledge to escape from Wonderland but ends up in hot water with the Queen of Hearts.
Directed by Anushka Senanayake a cast of over 50 students from Elizabeth Moir School took to the stage at the Lionel Wendt Theatre as they brought the wonders of the tale before Sri Lankan theatre enthusiasts. Comprising of dance performances choreographed by Melissa Fisher, the story brings to life all the well-loved characters included in the original tale from the White Rabbit to the March Hare, the Mad Hatter, Humpty Dumpty, Twiddle Dum and Twiddle Dee and the Queen of Hearts.
An enthralling scene of dancers clad in costumes representing greenery sway to the sounds of natures call as the curtains is drawn for the show. As the sounds fade away we are introduced to Alice who is hooked to her new mobile phone and is too engaged in conversation with a peer to notice the White Rabbit scurrying past. She, however, is brought back to earth when she notices that her phone battery is about to die. Her need to charge her phone rather than her curiosity about the talking rabbit lures Alice down the rabbit hole. There she meets many curious and wondrous creatures like the blue Caterpillar smoking a hookah and the grinning Cheshire Cat. She also stumbles upon strange experiences like having to drink and consume certain items to reach the necessary size for her to fit the Little Door in the Hall of Strange Doors. The drama team fittingly lowers the treats and the keys so that they create an illusion of magically appearing in the background as the action takes place on stage.
One of the highlights of the production is the entrance of the Caterpillar. The feisty creature being wheeled in while she is sprawling on a giant mushroom while smoking hookah is a visual treat for the audience and sure enough, the sight her entrance is greeted with much enthusiasm. The exchange between the two is also rather catchy and significant as both are at the brink of stepping into a new stage in their life.
Other episodes like a Toad and Fish selling newspapers and the talking flowers bring on more smiles. The scene of the Mad Hatters Tea Party is another enchanting episode which is excellently dished out by the actors. The scenes change without any disturbances and shifts to the next naturally.
A noteworthy fact in the production is the use of props which have been exquisitely designed not only to fit the storyline but also to woo the audience.
The entrance of a Papier-mch version of the Cheshire Cat makes us sit up and take note as it sets off a haunting atmosphere within the scenes lighting and sound setups. The carefully designed costumes too are flawless. All the students have memorized their lines down to a pat and their performance flows naturally. Each and every actor has done his or her bit to contribute to the allure of the play. Kudos to the cast and crew for their dedication in staging a show which has managed to capture the audience and keep them entertained till the end.

Evolving National Credit Policy:
Timely Need to Innovate
My article in Daily News Economic Insights on November 7, 2018 outlined the management of national money. As money is created by credit, national credit policy is nothing but national money policy. Money is one of the great inventions in the world that have immensely contributed to the human well-being to this stage. It is a facility for economic transactions by serving as a unit of account (valuing of transactions), a medium of exchange/payments, a medium of differed payments (lending/borrowing) and a liquid store of wealth.
In evolution of current paper plus electronic money system during the past six centuries from ancient barter transactions and commodity money systems, societies have invented a large number of credit/money instruments and institutions that operate from corner villages to international financial centres. The establishment of central banks to administer monetary systems has been the core in all countries. The system has been deepening in depth and breadth of money/credit whereas the usage of currency reduces while money circulates faster. The modern ICT and business accounting have provided considerable infrastructure for the present electronic money and credit.
Credit/Money Deepening
In early stage of deepening in countries, the focus is to shift societies from informal credit systems to banking to facilitate both payments and credit intermediation.
* The next stage is the development of a wide credit delivery system outside the banking to take more risks for business innovations. A large network of non-bank financial institutions (NBFI) and money, capital and insurance markets are among them. Meanwhile, state-sponsored directed credit schemes also are implemented to target priority economic sectors of national interest and to reduce economic disparities. Central banks are in the forefront with the governments at all stages of deepening because they are the monetary administrators.
* Deposits and credit of banks and NBFI are the major part of intermediation. Government securities, corporate equity and debt, venture capital, investment trusts/hedge funds, financial and commodity derivatives, structured credit products, exchange traded funds and insurance are the outer layers of credit markets. The transaction technology has advanced from the cash ledgers and physical promissory notes to password-based electronic ledgers and the latest block-chain/online peer-to-peer platforms.
* As economies got globalized through trade and value chains, countries have got extensively open to foreign currency credit products to finance the balance of payments. That has led to phase out exchange controls and open to cross-border credit/capital markets. In this context, foreign currency has become a significant source of liquidity to the credit pyramid in countries.
Sri Lanka also has been moving through similar stages of deepening with the state policy support as outlined below.
British Policy Initiatives
The British civil service recognized the needs for domestic credit and savings and took several initiatives.
* Currency Board System in 1884 to issue local currency Rupees in exchange of Indian Silver Rupee and gold to replace legal tenders of Indian Rupees and Sterling.
* Ceylon State Mortgage Bank in 1931, Banking Commission in 1934, establishment of Bank of Ceylon in 1939 and Agricultural and Industrial Credit Corporation in early 1940s based on the Banking Commissions recommendations and Co-operative Federal Bank in 1948to promote institutional credit.
* Ceylon Savings Bank in 1832, Post-Office Savings Bank in 1885 (through post-offices) and Ceylon Savings Certificates in 1942 to promote thrift around the country.
* Money Lending Ordinance of 1918, Pawn Broking Ordinance of 1942 and Trust Receipts Ordinance of 1947 to promote private money lending.
* Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance of 1918 (RSSO) and Local Treasury Bills Ordinance of 1923 (LTBO) to facilitate the credit market for Government and to establish the yield curve for credit risk premium in the wider economy.
Those continued post-independence towards early 1970s and helped the Sri Lankan civil service to introduce reforms and further improvements to the credit pyramid through state support.
Post-independent Sri Lankan Policy Initiatives
Until early 1990s, a significant state thrust was to promote money and credit in line with the British initiatives. In fact, some of new initiatives were the reforms to British initiatives.
Initial policies and research were focused on promotion of institutional credit to domestic economy and to eradicate informal sector rural indebtedness. This was needed as the colonial banking was to finance export plantation and foreign trade whereas the monetary system was foreign currency-based through international trade. Despite banking, co-operative movement (rural banking) and state credit and savings schemes, a large network of informal money lenders managed the domestic economy. Highlights of post-independence landmark policies are noted below.
1) Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CB)
The Monetary Law Act of 1949 (MLA) established the monetary system, the CB in 1950, bank regulation and wider credit distribution-based monetary policy by repealing the British Currency Board System. The CB is the pillar for providing the access to bank-based credit and money for the development of the country.
* The CB was initially empowered to carry out the national monetary policy of regulating the supply, availability, cost and character of credit by grant of credit to banks, inclusive of emergency credit to avert imminent financial panics.
* Under sections 82 to 85 of the MLA, the CB can grant commercial credit up to 180 days, production credit up to 270 days and other advances up to 270 days. In periods of deflation, such credit may be extended up to one year. Emergency credit is flexible under section 86 of the MLA. In 1963, new previsions 88A to 88G were enacted to the MLA to set up a medium and long-term credit fund (MLTCF) out of CBs reserves to grant credit to banks for productive purposes up to 15 years. The MLCTF was a major mechanism to implement development credit schemes as part of the monetary policy up to early 1990s. In 1980s, a sectoral-based national credit plan was monitored in the monetary policy.
* The flagship rural refinance scheme by the CB was the New Agricultural Credit Scheme in 1967 for paddy cultivation. This further advanced as Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme in 1973 and New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS) in 1986 to cover other food crops and co-operative banks assisted by the state extension services. The development of domestic agriculture is mostly owed to this credit scheme which was scaled down to a state interest subsidy scheme in 1994. Foreign funded SMI credit scheme in 1980s implemented through the CB also immensely helped development credit delivery and local enterprises. At present, the CB operates 14 small state sponsored credit schemes with total funds utilized of Rs. 13.6 bn and two CBs credit schemes of bout Rs. 4.6 bn. as at end of 2017.Accordingly, the NCRCS has shrunken to 72,000 farmers in the whole country in 2017.
* The CB established Development Finance Department (DFD) in 1974 and Rural Credit Department (RCD) in 1981 to actively implement a large number of refinance credit schemes up to 2000 to improve delivery of credit to rural agriculture and SMEs. For better coordination of such credit country-wide, 6 Regional Offices (RO) of the CB were set up since early 1980s. However, as these credit operations were phased out since latter part of 1990s, RCD and DFD were replaced with the Regional Development Department in 2000 to implement few refinance schemes, mainly on state funds. The RO became almost dormant with infrastructure and maintenance cost, other than coordination of ad-hoc financial literacy/entrepreneurial development meetings and supply of regional logistics to the CB.
* In 2006, the CB imposed a minimum level for bank credit to agriculture as 3% of total credit of respective banks by end of 2007 which was gradually increased to 6% in 2009 and 10% in 2010. This is a lose policy as it covers any credit that can cater to agricultural activities, i.e., growing, trade, transport, other services and housing. Banks can easily comply with the requirement by classifying any credit as agriculture whose credit supervision is rare.
* The monetary policy is now highly lean and passive to facilitate credit needs in the overnight inter-bank market based on targets of interest rates (policy rates) monitored by the CB to control overall credit/money growth in the economy. Therefore, the CB now does not have regard to sectoral credit needs of the wider economy in contrast to the MLA.
2) Development Bank Credit
* The establishment of Peoples Bank (PB) in 1961 was primarily for domestic retail credit by linking with the co-operative/rural banking movement scattered around the country. However, after the PB got to mainstream banking, it distracted the Co-operative movement and diverted to commercial credit. Due to large losses in commercial credit, a major restructuring process was followed since 1990s. Meanwhile, rural banking system followed a new track that could not strengthen the system. The nationalization of Bank of Ceylon in 1961 also was for domestic economy interests.
* Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon in 1955 and National Development Bank in 1979 were flagship development banks set up with state sponsored funds. Their lending processes and institutional culture were project appraisal, credit follow up, restructuring of sick projects, etc., on development/project-based credit. However, the CB passively allowed both banks to become commercial banks in 2015 and 2005.
* Since 1985, 17 Regional Rural Development Banks (RRDB) were established by the CB with its capital and management to promote rural development banking in respective districts with flexible and decentralized decision-making. Initially, they were supported by a large number of CBs refinance schemes until their rural deposit mobilization improved. RRDB with branches located in corner villages changed the landscape of rural and SME credit. The CB also passively let RRDB to get into political arms to appoint the Board of Directors and divested CBs capital to the Government. As a solution to subsequent financial difficulties, RRDB were first merged into 6 Regional Development Banks on provincial basis in 1997 and national level RDB in 2010. Its next phase probably will be a retail commercial bank as the CBs current national credit policy is highly market-based.
* A state credit system spanning from Janasaviya in 1989 to present Divinaguma/Samurddhi banking has remained for poverty alleviation/microfinances.
3) Housing Credit
Housing Loans Board in 1949 and National Housing Fund in 1954 were the early initiatives for specialized housing credit. Establishment of State Mortgage and Investment Bank in 1975 by combining The Ceylon State Mortgage Bank and The Agricultural and Industrial Credit Corporation, Housing Development Finance Corporation in 1984 and grant of housing loans on the security of the EPF balance to members facilitated housing development being a major socio-economic development initiative in post-independent Sri Lanka.
4) Savings Mobilization
National saving movement was streamlined by setting up the National Savings Bank in 1971 by merging the British savings movement of Ceylon Post Office Savings Bank, Ceylon Savings Bank and Savings Certificates scheme to fund the government. The bank was later permitted to lend for housing and retail purposes to its depositors. While all deposits are Government guaranteed, banks investment in government securities should not be less than 60% of its deposits. However, Post Office savings network disappeared later whereas they became payment agents for some private banks.
5) Other Supervised Credit Products
Housing Loans Board (1949), Local Loans and Development Fund (1949), legislations on pawn broking (several amendments to the ordinance of 1942), finance business (1988 and 2011), finance leasing (2000), hire purchase consumer credit (1982) also promoted credit landscape though NBFI at various degrees of risks.
* Emergence of finance companies and finance leasing companies produced a layer of financial intermediaries with considerable risks to the credit pyramid as they were permitted to take-deposits and promissory notes-based investments virtually repayable on demand to fund risky businesses. Ideally, such credit should be financed by capital and long-term debt that allow to take higher risks. The sector has survived two crises (1987/89 and 2008/09).
* Pawn broking which is essentially a private credit product was permitted to banks who have wider banking products for business. Banks also were permitted to carry on finance and leasing businesses. In this context, the banking system is now open to wider credit risks that should normally be taken by the outer credit pyramid or NBFI. Although the CB legalized microfinance in 2016, it has not been able to streamline microfinance which evolves to be a national menace.
6) Credit, Capital and Insurance Market
* Government securities and stock market have not been able to develop even to a basic level with standard products although they are old with a fair legislative environment (Securities and Exchange Commission Act of 1987, LTBO and RSSO) supported with liberalization of foreign capital.
* Insurance business which prevailed primarily at foreign hands since the British rule has got into state dominance with the establishment of Insurance Corporation of Ceylon in 1960 and regulatory framework under Regulation of Industry Act of 1962. Insurance is a source of wholesale credit while helping to cover risks of accidents and businesses.
7) Retirement Funds
Employees Provident Funds (EPF), Employees Trust Funds (ETF) and private provident and pension funds provide a significant source of compulsory savings. The use of these funds to develop private markets and dealing activities at substantial risks to members has been under constant criticisms since early 2000s. The use of provident funds to develop risk-taking private capital markets and dealers is not acceptable in common sense. The loss to the state guaranteed EPF due to such investments is reported to be huge that neither the fund manager (CB) nor the Government is accountable to reimburse losses to members where modern business accounting covers up such losses. The wisest option is to use such funds to finance government securities so that the funds are protected while banking and credit market are free to the private sector funding.
8) Credit Regulatory System
Mortgage Act of 1949, Banking Act of 1988, Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act of 1990, Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act of 1990 and Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka Act of 1990 mostly facilitate the safety and soundness of the banking system and credit discipline for wider national interests.
Need to Get Ready for New Economy
Nearly 7 decades of post-independence have been spent on policies to further improve the access to institutional savings and credit to promote domestic economy, primarily through the banking system. The last decade appears to be towards market-based bank credit.
There is no dispute over the improvement of access to institutional credit for the domestic economy due to above policy initiatives. The rural indebtedness to informal sources has declined to 14.7% in 2016 from 92.2% in 1957. However, questions remain whether present national credit policy and products are capable of promoting a modern credit pyramid to take risks to finance business expansion and innovations that are essential for the countrys next phase of economic and market development. The countrys economy has been unable to reach a globally competitive position to stay relevant to global supply chain without being vulnerable to short-term capital flows.
Money/credit is a highly regulated public good. Therefore, the regulatory system is responsible for a fair money/credit pyramid capable of serving all public with different risk appetite and skills in the wider economy. Therefore, the present Sri Lankan civil service led by the Treasury has to take the leadership to innovate the present money/credit pyramid for a new digital economy. We need to review the whole credit pyramid based on several guiding principles, rather than looking for ad-hoc and uncoordinated tinkering. A new framework such as the post-financial crisis US Dodd-Franck Act with business-friendly principles and rules is necessary to overhaul the credit delivery system fast. This could be the best policy package to be announced for development goals in the next one to two decades aligned to the global value chain with a sustainable real business base in the country.

UK says small number  of issues remain  for Brexit deal
EU: officials published a contingency plan on Tuesday for a 'no-deal' Brexit as negotiators scrambled to secure agreement in the next 24 hours, even as Britain said there were still a small number of issues to resolve.
In one measure, Brussels said it will offer visa-free travel within the bloc to Britons, but warned this was entirely conditional on the UK also granting reciprocal and non-discriminatory visa-free travel to EU citizens travelling to the UK.
After British and EU negotiators spent another night locked in talks, Prime Minister Theresa May told her cabinet in London that there had been progress but no text was yet ready for approval.
The value of the pound rose after May's deputy David Lidington told the BBC earlier on Tuesday that a deal was still possible, but not definite by Wednesday evening.
British officials say a deal must be agreed by then if Brussels is to call an extraordinary European Union summit later this month to sign off the agreement.
Failure means delaying the deal until a summit in mid-December, leaving little time for May to get it through a fractious House of Commons before Brexit day on March 29.
The prime minister told cabinet that since it has last met (a week ago), negotiations had continued in Brussels and good progress had made, May's spokesman said.
However the prime minister said there remained a small number of outstanding issues as the UK pushes for the best text which can be negotiated. A government official said it's closer than it was yesterday.
Lidington also on Tuesday promised the government would publish legal analysis on any divorce agreement after it is announced, following pressure from the main opposition Labour Party.
Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a leading eurosceptic who quit the government in July over May's plan, accused the prime minister of theatrics.
No one is fooled by this theatre. Delay after staged managed delay. A deal will be reached and it will mean surrender by the UK, he tweeted.
The talks with Brussels are stuck on how to avoid border checks between British Northern Ireland and Ireland after the UK leaves the EU's single market and customs union.
London suggests that until a wider trade deal is agreed that resolves the problem, Britain could temporarily stay aligned with the bloc's trade rules -- as long as it can exit the arrangement when it wants.
The EU appears only ready to accept that if Britain agrees another fall-back option in which Northern Ireland alone remains part of the single market.
May's Northern Irish allies in the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), strongly oppose this, arguing that it undermines the integrity of the United Kingdom.
Pro-Brexit MPs like Johnson also fear Britain could end up being locked in an endless customs union with the EU.
Opposition in Parliament to May's plan has raised fears the Brexit deal will be rejected and Britain will leave the EU without any agreement.
The cabinet received an update on Britain's preparedness for a no deal scenario, as it has for several weeks now, with speculation that the moment to trigger the plans is fast approaching.
Leading food manufacturer Premier Foods revealed on Tuesday it will start stockpiling ingredients.
In the absence of certainty over the arrangements for the UK's departure from the EU, the group shortly intends to start a process of building stocks of raw materials to protect the company against the risk of delays at ports, it said.
Elements of the divorce deal already agreed include Britain's exit bill of around 39 billion (45 billion euros, $50 billion) as well as a guarantee on EU citizens' rights.
May has guaranteed Europeans living in Britain that they will be able to stay after Brexit, no matter what.
But new figures show the number of EU nationals working in Britain fell by 132,000 to 2.25 million, the largest annual fall since comparable records began in 1997. The divorce deal also provides for a 21-month transition after Brexit during which London would follow EU rules, in which both sides can negotiate a new trade relationship. - AFP

Waiting for Dingo
Fraser Island spreads from the southern coast of Queensland towards the northern part ending in close proximity to Great Barrier Reef of Australia. In written history, it had been the home for Butchulla people in the past and with the rapid strides of world tourism, today it has become a popular tourist attraction. Butchulla people had been the pioneer inhabitants of this sandy island.
Fraser Island is the worlds largest sandy island and every inch of land is veritably sandy. The dazzling lakes enhance the natural cooling effect of this land mass and the coloured sands form a most spectacular eye treat. The turbulent human history coupled with the virgin eco-system creates its own tale to be told to anyone who has not visited this magical paradise before. One can see the ever expanding natural sand blows on Fraser Island.
Soothing balm
They steal the show. Dingo is a wild dog that dominates the wild life here and the lush rain forests provide a soothing balm to the weary mind, in other words Fraser Island could be a memorable retreat to the city dweller from any clime. In a different sense, to an injured mind, Fraser Island could be the island of Avilian in Alfred Lord Tennysons poem Mort De Arthur. All in all, it is really a miracle of nature and fun and adventure seekers could derive much pleasure on this island. Its uniqueness has put it on the world heritage area map with the other 400 areas of that category.
In order to derive the best of taste of the island, a three day tour is a must. I had the good fortune to peep into the history and the eco system of this island as our tour had been accurately preplanned.
On the white sandy beaches, the remains of a shipwreck stand majestically to open a window for us to peep into its history. A Scottish make ship by the name The Seabelle had destined to be wrecked and drifted to the Fraser Island beaches by the terrible storms and sea currents at a time when the ships had not been guided by a lighthouse. The internet descriptions on shipwrecks record The Seabelle ship wreck as follows. It is a living legend on Fraser Island.
First ships
The Seabelle was one of the first ships to be receded as lost off Fraser Island. The 158 ton schooner left Rockhampton on March 7, 1857 and was wrecked on the following day on Break Sea Spit, the northern eastern tip of the Fraser Island.
Rumours abounded around the survivors of The Seabelle. A white woman and two white girls were reported to be living with Fraser Island aboriginals New South Wales authorities commissioned the captain of the Coquette to investigate and he brought to Sydney the two young girls who were albino. They were never returned to their parents as he had promised and they died in an institution in Sydney an old age. Moheno is another ship that had met with the same fate and Moheno Restaurant on Frser Island caters the visitors with a lot of dishes displaying their culinary skills. Dining there with the spirit of adventure and awareness of the pristine glory of the battles lost and won add life to the soul of the visitor.
Dingo is a kind of wild dogs and its history of survival on the island is as old as its history. The pioneer in habitants of the Fraser Island Buchulla community had once used them for their many a work. The Dingo is a protected animal on the island now. I sighted two Dingoes at their natural behavior and they are not dependable. Dingo is never a pet. They are very aggressive when they are with their pups. It is said that Dingoes run and trot around 40 miles a day in search of food. They are omnivorous.
Adventure seekers
The fun of driving on quick sand is both adventurous and risky. Yet, the passing by other adventure seekers are always at the ready to rescue fellow tourists at any cost. A dip in a lake on Fraser Island adds to your memory bank for you to withdraw at leisure and enjoy. Our Toyota Fortuner once sank in quick sand, but taken back to the sandy track again by some Australian pleasure seekers. On Fraser Island everyone is emotionally human. A vast wealth of experience, a welter of information and a mountain of evidence on human endurance were added to my life.

A welcome directive
President Maithripala Sirisena, no doubt, will receive the ringing endorsement of all civic -minded members of the public for his attempts to have clean elections. It is the usual practice for the ruling party to have all the cards stacked in its favour at elections, chiefly the ability to dish out largesse to the voters. There is also the abuse of public property such as the free use of Government vehicles that include chopper rides for campaigning. It is reported that foreign leaders including the US President Donald Trump have to pay the State for travel arrangements to political meetings.
President Sirisena has issued strict orders to all former MPs against misusing public property during the election period, on pain of legal action. At the time of writing, the Supreme Court verdict on the legality or otherwise of the dissolution of the Parliament by the President was still pending. But from all indications, political parties are gearing up for elections. Even the UNP, which had petitioned the Court, was in election mode with several of its spokesmen talking in terms of making Sajith Premadasa the Prime Ministerial candidate while proposals have also been made by the party to form a grand alliance to contest the election. Elections Commissions Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya is busy with the preliminaries to hold an election, the Supreme Court hearing notwithstanding.
It is in this backdrop that the President's orders assume significance. He has asked all former MPs, State Ministers and Deputy Ministers to return their vehicles and public property to the relevant Ministry Secretaries to avoid having legal action taken against them under Election laws. He reiterated that strict action would be taken against any member of the Government who misuses public property for election purposes. In his address to the nation on Sunday night, the President stated he would extend all support to the Elections Commission to ensure a free and fair election.
President Sirisena is perhaps the first Head of State to take affirmative action to ensure that a free and fair election is being held. All past leaders only paid lip service in this respect and their guarantees in this respect lacked conviction. Public property was abused to the hilt by the ruling party politicians with nary a care that they were doing so at the expense of the public purse. This is why the President reminded all that it was illegal to use Government property for election purposes. He also said that only the President, Prime Minister and Cabinet members would function in the Caretaker Government.
It has to be said that all parties, while in power, were guilty of election law violations, not just with public property but also other acts such as giving incentives to voters. There were instances galore where polling stations were stormed by goons and ballot boxes stuffed. The Wayamba Provincial Council election was a watershed where election law violations reached a new low.
President Sirisena also said he would be forced to take legal action against former MPs misusing Government vehicles and other public property during the election period. He would receive further public praise if he gave specific instructions to the law enforcement to bring to book any trouble makers, during the run up to the election and on polling day. We say this because the police generally tend to handle ruling party politicians and their supporters with kid gloves, not only during election times but on other occasions as well, as is only too well known.
The President's attitude is a clear indication that he is committed to ending this trend and holding a free and fair election. Hence, the instructions should not only be confined to dealing with those who abuse public property but also extend to general law and order during the polls campaign period.
During the last Presidential Election the then Elections Commissioner (now Elections Commission Chairman) acted commendably and received all round praise for his intrepidity for taking on the full might of the Government. He also received plaudits for overseeing the February 10 Local Government election without incident. The fact that a relatively new party won that election while the established parties took a beating shows how free and fair the poll was.
There is no reason to believe he will act any different this time around. It is time that the country adopts a new political culture where the people are free to exercise their franchise without any intimidation. All party leaders must rein in their more adventuress supporters. True, there could be clashes between rivals in a heated election campaign and certain incidents are unavoidable. But these should not be allowed to escalate and mar the entire electoral process.
There is also the need to nominate educated and honest candidates as we have been repeatedly advocating in these spaces. All political parties have an opportunity to do this at the election. This country could certainly do well by bringing into the electoral process the erudite, the professionals and scholars whose contributions will be invaluable for us as a nation.

Where Shakespeare abides today
People were tired and somewhat disappointed watching touring company of Shakespeare on the roadside, in the open countryside, vacant spots in around Shakespeare country and the patronage was dropping fast.
Something had to be done.
Growing interest of audience, actors, directors etc; frustrated their desire The identity of a national theatre became an obsession. The fate of arts and acting on improvised theatre needed a plush setting as well as the properly lit stage to support various scenes with props on which popularity would blossom and enhance the story and dialogue value.
Thus began the road to stardom.
Gone were the days of bare stages and travelling theatre with intensity cast overacting which were to produce thespians in near future. Theatre had to be part of their culture that would earn its place in British history, eventually.
THE GLOBE
The most popular of all theatres especially with today's audience, the Globe theatre in 1599 where Shakespeare had a share. This is sited in Southwark on the south bank of Thames. It burnt down accidentally during a performance of HENRY 111, rebuilt and opened again in 1641. Thirty years later the Puritans pulled it down for no reason.
Then came the saviour in the form of Sam Wanamaker, the Hollywood actor and director who was a passionate devotee of Shakespeare and his plays. Arriving in England, he started looking over the original site of the Globe in 1940 but the locals knew little about its history. However, he found a plaque that indicated the site and went about in determination to rebuild the Globe that was a going to be his tribute to the Bard whose works fascinated him. The Shakespeare Globe Trust was set up with Prince Phillip as Patron and Wanamaker as Chief Executive. Fundraising Committees were set up in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, India and Germany with Friends of Shakespeare's Globe. All financial hurdles were overcome and the final phase of the building started in June 1922. Tragically, Wanamaker died in 1993 deprived of seeing his dream reaching the last brick but the whole world knows that The Globe is his beautiful dream come true.
THE OLD VIC
In 1818 a theatre named Royal Cobourg was built at the Junction of Waterloo Road and Cut south of Thames and later renamed the Royal Victoria and in its place stand The Old. Vic. This theatre had a turbulent early history but under the guidance of Emma Cons, it modulated in 1880 to the Royal Victoria Hall. Con's niece, Lillian Bails volunteered to help. She was just twenty-three years of age and in 1914, chose to present Shakespeare as well as popular operas in the theatre with its gaslit stage. This went well under such directors like Ben Grist and Robert Atkins. By autumn of 1923 the tercentenary year of the First Folio, every play the canon had been performed by such actors like Sybil Thorndyke, Ion Swinley, Edith Evans etc. The new director, Harcourt Williams in 1929 commissioned the young John Gielgud as the leading man during two renowned seasons, with the help of such big names as that of Peggy Ashcroft, Tyrone Gutheri, Charles Laughton, Flora Robson and many others. The theatre established itself in 1930. In 1937 Laurence Olivier's HAMNET and Henry V announced the emergence of a major Shakespeare theatre. After so much of dedication and perseverance to promote theatre to the vibrant image, Lilian Baylis died later the same year but not before she saw the Vic become in effect a National Theatre. Then came the devastation; the theatre was bombed and the company moved to the New Theatre (known as Albery today) from 1944 to the spring of 1950. Later under the direction of Olivier, Richardson, and director John Burrell were the years of Olivier's famous RICHARD III (1944) the two Henry IV chronicles (1945). Steadily Shakespeare characters emerged gloriously to capture the imagination of the audiences. In 1949 another old Vic sprang up at the Theatre Royal in Bristol and HAMLET was directed by Michael Redgrave.
This was followed by the opening of the Waterloo Road theatre under Hugh Hunt. With the passing of many summers, The Old Vic was the monument for other subsidiary theatres, some of which survived while the others faded away. The National Company left for its new theatre while the Prospect Company appeared under The Old Vic. PROSPECT became known officially as The Old Vic Company in 1979.
THE NATIONAL THEATRE
Until the completion of their own theatre which took nearly thirteen years from 1963, the National Theatre put up with the OLD VIC in readiness at the South Bank. Despite the National Theatre being suggested as far back as 1848, the work did not commence until 1969, after a false start in 1951. The first Chairman of the South Bank Theatre Board, set up in 1962 to oversee the building of the theatre. The three theatres in all contained nearly 2500 seats. Lord Oliver Littleton was a director from 1963 - 1973 followed by Sir Peter Hall who took over until 1988. It was also in 1988 that the National Theatre gained a Royal charter.
OPEN AIR FESTIVAL
Twelfth Night was the first play to be launched at the OPEN AIR FESTIVAL at Regent's Park by Australian actor who masterminded the idea, Sydney Carrol along with director, Robert Atkins. This was in 1932 and despite the losses of 560, Carrol was given the opportunity to establish a theatre in the Inner Circle adjoining Queen Mary's Garden. As it is presently, the open air stage was backed by a screen of poplar with a marquee on hand for inclement weather. Carrol who reshaped the stage planted trees and hired deckchairs along with long benches that drew the first audience of nearly 2500 people. He lost 3000 but he was not disappointed. Determine to secure a financial future, sought funding from the Arts Council. A year later, the Company had its first overseas tour. Director, David Conville associated with theatre for more than thirty years featuring some of the world's leading thespians.
Established in 1986 by the director, Michael Bogdanov, the ESC along with actor, Michael Pennington, their inaugural production was Henry IV. They toured throughout the world to great success and acclaim and added four new productions to form the WAR OF ROSES which is Shakespeare's complete history cycle and for which Michael Bondanov won the Olivier award as Best Producer. Over fifteen plays were performed in the next six years including a tour of four African countries. This included a special adaption of Macbeth along with Coriolanus and The Winter's Tale.
STRATFORD- ONTAAIO
One of the greatest tributes paying homage to non-Canadian William Shakespeare is the Stratford- Ontario that fired the imagination of local journalist, Tom Patterson, the possibility of an annual Shakespeare Festival in the Canadian Stratford, took place at small Ontario town by the Canadian Avon.
Tyrone Gaucherie tempted by unexpected ideas agreed immediately to come down from England to direct an Elizabethan play evolved by Tanya Moiseiwitch. Originally the festivals were held in a large tent but summer 1953, Alec Guinness acted Richard 111 with Irene as Helena in Allswell That Ends Well which were Guthrie's favourite plays. It was a beginning of a dream to all Shakespeare-loving Canadians and became the home all North American audiences. There were a variety of administrators of high profile like Tyrone, Gutherie, Michael Laughton, Jean Gascon and Robin Phillips. The stage remained in its original form as a Stratford creation and during its thirty years, the Shakespeare Folio was very consistent. The summer festival was given international fame to its inconspicuous town and is still under director Phillips.
SAM WANAMAKER CBE 1919 - 1993
The new Globe in Southwark is the work of many people and the dream of one man.
When the young American actor came to London in 1949, he set out to visit the site of Shakespeare's Globe and was amazed to find that the only testimony to its existence was a blackened bronze plaque on the wall of a brewery. He conceived of a fitter memorial to the great playwright, a replica of the Globe itself.
Sam Wanamaker's enthusiasm, tenacity and energy inspired a worldwide effort to rebuild the Globe as faithfully as scholarship and craftsmanship could achieve, only a few hundred yards from where Shakespeare's original stood. As you visit the new Globe you are witnessing the fulfilment of Sam's dream.
