Ageless Dilshan still a match-winner
BANGALORE: Age it seems is no barrier for the ageless Tillakaratne Dilshan who at 39 is still good enough to win matches for his country.
Sri Lanka had to thank the cool head of Dilshan and the experience he brought to the middle to surpass Afghanistan's total of 153-7 as Sri Lanka opened their ICC World T20 campaign with a six wickets win with seven balls to spare.
Dilshan anchored the innings from one end to score a flawless unbeaten 83 off 56 balls and after receiving the man of the match award said, "If I am batting like this, I don't want to think of any retirement. I am enjoying my cricket. I haven't thought anything on those lines. If I get up in the morning and feel that I don't enjoy, I will retire. But as of now I am enjoying everything and I want to go on."
Such words will be like music to the ears of Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews whose struggling team is looking for some match winners to get their game on track.
"The main target is when you get a start you need to finish it. The seniors in every team need to step up and put their hands up and do a job. We have lot of young guys in the side. They can bat around the seniors and gain experience. It's much easier when you chase targets," said Dilshan.
"It was a good target. The wicket was a bit slow and not easy. We had played a practice game here before. It's not easy to play spin bowlers. Once I got the start, I wanted to go on. It's not easy when you are a new batsman to go out in the middle and strike the ball straight away. That's why I held up one end batted through. They batted well. We knew it wouldn't be an easy task. We thought of someone batting through the innings," he said.
One area where Dilshan stands supreme defying his age is his fielding. He is still the best fielder in the team and there is no hidden secret behind his success.
"I train a lot in that vital discipline of fielding. I work a lot with the fielding coaches. If I can contribute something on the field, I am really happy," said Dilshan.
"My attitude when I go to the field is that I want every ball to come my way. That helps me to keep the enthusiasm very high. I field at cover point and I take lot of pride in it.
I want to help the team through a run out or a half chance. I try to set high standards when it comes to fielding and I encourage others also to do well in field."
Sri Lanka certainly needs to raise their fielding standards after spilling three catches against Afghanistan and allowing them to go past a total in excess of 150.
Their next opponents are the West Indies on Sunday.

Malinga ruled out of T20 World Cup
BANGALORE: For fast bowler Lasith Malinga the ICC World T20 has ended. Malinga was flown back to Colombo from Kolkata yesterday after failing a fitness test on his injured left knee.
Malinga underwent the test during the team's practice session ahead of their opening World T20 fixture against Afghanistan which Sri Lanka won by six wickets on Thursday.
Although Sri Lanka won that tie against an associate-member country without the services of Malinga they would certainly require his experience and match-winning skills for the rest of the tournament when they front up with West Indies (Sunday), England (March 27) and South Africa (March 28).
A replacement for Malinga is expected to be picked from Colombo where Sri Lanka Cricket has arranged two T20 matches between two sides for players to be in readiness for a national call-up if required.
The name of the selected replacement will have to be sent to the ICC technical committee for approval before he can join the team.
Malinga's loss is a big blow to Sri Lanka's chances of defending the T20 World Cup which they won in 2014 under his captaincy.
From the outset Malinga had questioned his selection and had said that it was a waste of time sending him to India for the World T20 because he was not fully recovered from the injury. However the selection committee headed by former cricketer Aravinda de Silva knew the impact Malinga had on the team as well as the opposition and opted to include him in the 15 hoping that he would recover from the injury.
As it has turned out to be the gamble has failed and Sri Lanka are left to defend the title without him.
There is likelihood that either fast bowler Kasun Rajith or spinner Ajantha Mendis may be sent to fill Malinga's vacancy.
Tillakaratne Dilshan, Man of the match in the game against Afghanistan on Thursday said he expects the spinners to have a huge impact in the T20 World Cup.

New Zealand defeat Australia in thriller
DHARAMSALA, FRIDAY: Recalled paceman Mitchell McClenaghan grabbed three crucial wickets and then thanked his team's spinners Friday after New Zealand edged past Australia in a last over thriller at cricket's World Twenty20.
A year on from the Black Caps' heartache defeat to Australia in the 50 over World Cup final, New Zealand exacted revenge over their neighbours who were left to rue their decision to go with spin.
Australia had appeared well set to chase down New Zealand's modest total of 142 for eight, needing a relatively straightforward 43 runs off the last five overs with six wickets in hand.
But tight bowling from rookie spinners Mitchell Santner and Ish Sodhi put on the brakes before a devastating penultimate over from McClenaghan who finished with figures of three for 17.
He conceded just three runs in his last six balls, taking the wickets of Mitchell Marsh and Ashton Agar after earlier snaring Shane Watson.
It left Australia needing 19 runs in their last over bowled by Corey Anderson who just about held his nerve, conceding 10 runs.
"Nice to perform like that but it was as a collective," said McClenaghan after being named man-of-the-match.
"The spinners were fantastic and got us back in the game. It's nice to show some teams we can play in these conditions."
Australian skipper Steve Smith agreed Sodhi and Santner had been the difference.
"Obviously their spinners bowled extremely well, they ran through the middle," said Smith.
"We didn't respond well, we lost wickets in clumps which you can't do in T20 cricket when you are chasing a total of 140."
McClenaghan was a surprise replacement for Nathan McCullum, one of the heroes of New Zealand's dramatic victory over the hosts India on Tuesday.
But skipper Kane Williamson's switch was vindicated in spectacular style while Australia came to regret picking two inexperienced spin bowlers in Agar and Adam Zampa. AFP

Vandersay replaces Malinga in SL squad
Sri Lanka have named legspinner Jeffrey Vandersay as Lasith Malinga's replacement, after a knee injury ruled the fast bowler out of the tournament on Friday. Vandersay had been named in Sri Lanka's original squad but was withdrawn later on after Sri Lanka's new selection committee took over. Among the two changes that were made, Vandersay had been replaced by Suranga Lakmal in the squad.

Vandersay made his T20I debut last July against Pakistan and has picked only one wicket in four T20Is so far. He was included for the Asia Cup recently but was unused because of the seamer-friendly pitches in Bangladesh. (espncricinfo)
