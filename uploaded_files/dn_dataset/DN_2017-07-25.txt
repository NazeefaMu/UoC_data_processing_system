Lanka needs relaxing liquor restriction regulations
Sri Lanka must seriously look at relaxing regulation on liquor restrictions as its stumbling block for the industry, said Minister of Tourism and Christian Affairs, John Amaratunge.
Speaking at the Certification Scheme for Tourist Friendly Eating Places, award ceremony he said that a Swedish national was apprehended and fined Rs. 100, 000 for carrying 50 cans of beer for his consumption in Aurugam Bay.
I dont want to criticize courts but my feeling is that this fine is uncalled for and he should have been warned and discharged. I feel the Swedish national should never have been arrested in the first place as they come to enjoy Sri Lanka and these incidents give a bad message to global travellers.
The Minister said that he had been fighting hard to relax licensing of beer and wine issuing licenses which have less than 7% alcohol strength but was unsuccessful.
But in a Buddhist country like Thailand one can find spirits in every super market almost 24 hours day and it is high time that Sri Lanka too should think in these lines.
In a bid to encourage the upgrading of food safety, hygiene and service of eating places providing food for foreign and local tourists in Kandy city Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLDA) in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Kandy Municipal Council launched Certification Scheme for Tourist Friendly Eating Places, yesterday.
Phase one of the project launched earlier this year covered eating places in the Colombo Municipality limits and phase two of the project has covered eating places in Kandy. Galle district would be targeted next and a nominal registration fee of Rs. 1,000 charger for the registration which has to be renewed annually.

Toppling government a pipe dream'
Making reference to Article 70 of the Constitution of the Republic, a Senior Stalwart of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) fired warning signals at dissidents and members of the party asserting that the discourse of toppling the government, is but a pipe dream. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the current Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation and one of the most senior members of the SLFP pointing out the balance of power within the Parliament said that, in order to change the status quo a majority of 2/3rds is required in Parliament.
Many people in the Joint Opposition have been dreaming of toppling the Unity Government and forming a new one. It will only remain a dream. They could dance in any which way they want to but, this government would continue till 2020. If there is to be a change there needs to be a two thirds majority, he said. De Silva pointed this out, making reference to Article 70 of the Constitution as amended by the 19th Amendment.
The Amendment specifies that if an election was to be called for by the President by dissolving Parliament four years and six months from the date appointed for its (Parliaments) first meeting, the President could only do so by a resolution passed by not less that two-thirds of the whole number of members (including those not present) voting in its favour.
Speaking at the Badulla Auditorium during the SLFP Badulla District Bala Mandalaya,de Silva said that he stood firm with the party throughout.
Unlike many people, we didnt play double games. During the 2015 Presidential election, we all worked for the then leader of the party Mahinda Rajapaksa.However,he lost. Thereafter the leadership of the party was handed over to Maithripala Sirisena.
He invited us to form the Unity Government instead of kicking us out. He did that because he wanted to protect our party. We joined the government consequent to the Central Committee decision of the party, he said.
Making clear and unambiguous reference to members of the party who are currently not aligned with the government, he said that they have set upon themselves the goal of destroying the party.
There are certain sections within the SLFP who want to break our party, to destroy this government. These conspirators have made it their priority to divide us.But, we wont fall prey to them, the SLFP wont fall prey to these conspiracies, he said.
He further said that the majority partner of the government could form a government without the SLFP.
If the SLFP leaves, the UNP could form a government on their own. They have 106 Parliamentarians, while only 113 seats are required to form a government. The required seats could be from the Joint Opposition or the TNA, he said, while asserting that the SLFP would stand united against the onslaught.
During the ceremony attended by Spokesperson for the SLFP, Dilan Perera, the Chief Minister of the Uva Province Chamara Dassanayaka and other district leaders of the party, Silva reiterated that the government would remain intact until 2020.
Whether we like it or not this government would be in place till 2020. It is something that the 19th Amendment specifies. In a few months the local government elections would be held and we will be nominating our representatives. The elections will be held on the first past the post system and the people could chose their representatives. The people should never be afraid of this government being changed. It wont he said.
The 19th Amendment to the Constitution was passed on April 28, 2015 with 215 MPs voting for the amendment.

Aussie players reportedly mull Bangladesh boycott
Sydney: Australias senior players have voted to boycott next months tour of Bangladesh unless their long-running pay dispute with Cricket Australia (CA) is settled before they leave, reports said Monday.
Captain Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner attended an undisclosed meeting with Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) chief executive Alastair Nicholson to consider their options after a breakdown in the talks with CA last week.
The Australian newspaper said the players discussed a range of options, including going ahead with the Bangladesh tour under a special contractual arrangement.
But they resolved to stand by the resolutions reached at a previous meeting and refuse to take part in any tours unless there is a new memorandum of understanding in place.
The players are entering their fourth week of unemployment since the failure to reach a new agreement on pay at the end of June.
The squad voted to attend the training camp in Darwin on August 10 but will not leave for Bangladesh a week later unless an agreement is reached, the newspaper said.
The first match of the two-Test series was due to start 10 days later.
The Australia A squad went through a similar process before abandoning the tour to South Africa earlier this month.
The dispute is over CAs refusal to renew a revenue-sharing arrangement which has been part of all deals over the past two decades.
Reports said the ACA was close to a deal with CA last week. Players proposed they retain the revenue-sharing model but sacrifice up to Aus$30 million ($24 million) of their pay to grassroots cricket.
But CA would not offer a revenue-sharing deal.
The players expressed disappointment at the latest developments in the protracted dispute, which threatens the showpiece Ashes home series against England later this year.
Not sure the players can do much more to solve the dispute. Were really proud to offer up to an extra $30 million for grassroots #fairshare, Warner tweeted.
Fast bowler Pat Cummins added:Players are as frustrated as anyone else. We want to play. Offering even more to grassroots to get a deal!!! #fairshare. AFP

Brilliantly chilling recall of a classic
lady Bacbeth is a 2016 British drama film directed by William Oldroyd, based on the novel lady Macbeth by Nikolai Leskov. It stars Florence Pugh, Cosmo Jarvis, Paul Hilton, Naomi Ackie and Christopher Fairbank.
The movie won awards at Dublin film Critics Circle Awards, Jameson Dublin International Film Festival, Les Arcs European Film Festival, Montclair Film Festival, Palm Springs International Film Festival, San Sebastian International Film festival, Thessaloniki film Festival and Zurich Film Festival.
Set in 19th century rural England, a young bride who has been sold into marriage to a middle-aged man discovers an unstoppable desire within herself as she enters into an affair with a worker on her estate.
Much of the films allure comes from the main powerhouse performance from Florence Pugh. In only her second feature, the 21-year-old actress reveals the kind of technical precision and command of the screen youd see in a veteran. It is portrayed by the smart, sexy, dour qualities that are weaponized by a lethal charismatic lead performance by her as the unrepentant killer. She is both spinx and minx.
It has the rapid heartbeat of a brutal psychological thriller. You simply cannot stop watching is beauty, even as you long to look away from its cruelty.
Lady Macbeth is screening at Majestic Cineplex 10.15 am, 1.15 pm, 4.15 pm, 7.15 pm, and Fri/Sat at 10.15 pm and Empire Cineplex 1.30 pm, 4.30 pm, 7.30 pm and Fri/Sat at 10.30 pm and Sat/Sun at 10.30 am.

CCD to identify spoilers
The Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) yesterday informed the Colombo Chief Magistrate that they have initiated an investigation into the incident where a group of police officers were obstructed by several individuals during the arrest attempt on Medical Faculty Students Action Committee Convener Ryan Jayalath on July 20.
Following a request by the CCD, Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara issued an order directing six television channels that videos footage pertaining to alleged police obstruction be handed over to police to carry out investigations.
The CCD is investigating to arrest Ryan Jayalath for forcibly entering the Health Ministry premises and damaging its property amounting to Rs.870,000.
A tense situation arose on July 20 when the CCD attempted to arrest Ryan Jayalath following an anti-SAITM discussion at the GMOA office at the Organisation of Professional Associations (OPA) building in Colombo.
As the crowd at the OPA premises protested, Police had left without taking Jayalath into custody.
The CCD informed Court that police officers had arrived in a white van belonging to the Police Department and acted in accordance with the law.

Solution to air pollution
Through this column, I would like to suggest some measures for controlling the growing air pollution in Colombo and suburbs.
First of all, all heavy vehicles should be restricted from entering the city. Such vehicles should be allowed only at certain times. Only light commercial vehicles should carry the goods to the heart of the city. The CTB and other private buses plying within the city should be given a separate lane. The three-wheelers should be banned and be replaced by small car-like cabs to transport commuters within the city.
Besides, all personal vehicles entering the city during the peak hour should be heavily fined. These steps along with the working of a complete railway in Colombo and suburbs will go a long way in controlling the growing air pollution in the city. Unless such and other similar steps are taken immediately, the problem of air pollution will certainly assume serious proportions.
I hope the concerned authorities will pay prompt attention to this growing menace which is sure to jeopardize peoples everyday life unless timely action is initiated.

Classical, Carnatic and Belcanto style music on stage
Shruthi, vocal music concert featuring Devin Ganegoda will be held on July 29 at 6.30 pm at the Bishops College auditorium. The concert is a combination of both classical Carnatic and Belcanto style music.
Music compositions and live directions with full orchestra for this evening are done by leading Carnatic composer, lecturer and vocalist A. Aruran, well known music composer, Visharada Samantha Perera and by Francis D Almeida who is one of the most senior and eminent vocal trainers in the country. Samantha Perera will be creating music for two new songs and the lyrics are done by Prof. Praneeth Abeysundara and Preethi Ganegoda.
Devins mother, Preethi Ganegoda is an eminent Bharathanatyam dancer. Therefore Carnatic music was something he grew up with.
I anyway liked Carnatic music. I started listening to it from my childhood. I believe the interest was in me from those days. However I started learning Carnatic music only after finishing my O/Ls, says Devin.
Devin, a 17 year old, is studying in the science stream. He says his ultimate goal is to become an astrophysicist and work for NASA.
I have great interest in music and Bharathanatyam. It will always be no matter what my profession is going to be. I believe music can develop someones personality in a great way.
Devins mother who is the organiser of the concert, Shruthi says that Devin always sets himself the highest targets for personal progress for achievement.
His dedication to classical music is a reflection of his essential qualities as a dedicated, committed and passionate young person. All these inspired to organise this concert for him to reach this pivotal moment. This concert is a culmination of tireless years of enthusiasm and effort. It is an honor for me to be his mother and mentor.
On the day of the concert, Devins sister, 11 year old Natalie Anuththara, will also be performing to her brothers song. She will be launching her book on Bharathanatyam named, The divine dance- Bharathanatyam.
Many Scholars and reputed artists will grace the occasion.

Cooler credit growth forecast for Sri Lankas banks - OBG
Following several years of high lending, hiked interest rates and the pursuit of Basel III compliance, credit growth in Sri Lanka could slow this year and into 2018.
On the back of government efforts to stimulate growth in the economy, private sector credit expanded by 18% last year and by just over 20% in 2015 says a report filed by Oxford Business Group. (OBG)
However, in a move aimed at reducing excessive credit expansion and inflationary pressures, in March the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) increased both its standing deposit facility rate and its standing lending facility rate by 25 basis points, bringing them to 7.5% and 8.75%, respectively.
In addition to interest rate growth, Sri Lankas banks may find expanding their loan books a challenge due to tax hikes implemented earlier this year, according to a report issued by ratings agency Fitch last month.
Confirming the sectors negative outlook for the year, the ratings agency suggested it will face challenges due to a wider economic slowdown: GDP growth eased marginally in 2016 to 4.29%, down from 4.78% in 2015 and 4.87% in 2014, according to IMF figures. However, the IMF forecasts economic expansion of 4.8% and 4.9% in the next two years.
Fitch also noted that while Sri Lankas credit-to-GDP ratio has grown in recent years  from 30% in 2014 to 45% today  it is still the lowest in the region. Malaysia and Singapore, for example, both have a credit-to-GDP ratio of around 130%, while Thailands stands at 150%.
With such aggressive lending undertaken in the previous two years, stakeholders were concerned that bubbles would develop in certain sectors.
It is possible that these fears have been borne out, with Indrajit Coomaraswamy, Governor of the CBSL, recently voicing the Central Banks suspicion that some credit lines intended as support mechanisms for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises have fed into the real estate industry.
Coomaraswamy noted that the bank had not yet decided on a course of action, but suggested the bank could move to take macro-prudential measures to slow the property market to put it on a more sustainable growth path.
Observers have also noted that high dividend payments have reduced capital buffers among some of Sri Lankas banks.
The three largest banks  the National Savings Bank, Bank of Ceylon and Peoples Bank Sri Lanka  paid 76% of their profits as dividends last year.
Thin capitalisation could take on increased significance as the sector moves towards meeting the requirements of Basel III, which are set to come into effect at the beginning of 2019.
Under the requirements of Basel III, local banks will have to maintain a minimum of 7% in risk-weighted assets (RWAs) under common equity Tier-1 (CET 1); Tier-1 capital of at least 8.5%; as well as total capital (CET 1, additional Tier-1 and Tier-2 capital) of at least 12.5%, up from the current minimum of 10%.
Banks designated as systemically important  that is, those with more than LKR500bn ($3.4bn) in assets  will also be required to have an additional buffer of 1.5% in RWAs. Six banks currently meet this criterion, according to CBSL data.
Ratings agency S&P has also warned about the risk to capital buffers stemming from high loan growth, which it said could negatively impact banks already, declining capital levels.
This may further reduce the buffers required to absorb the pain that could come from worsening asset quality, the agency said in a statement issued at the end of the first quarter.
Indeed, non-performing loans rose by 7% in the first three months of the year, according to Fitch.
Requirements to build capital reserves and deteriorating portfolios may see some banks curb their loan activity in the lead up to the 2019 deadline, potentially resulting in falls in revenue and dividends as they shore up their fiscal position at the expense of earnings from lending.

Creating dialogue on CTFRM Final Report
Sri Lanka underwent a 30 - year long civil war, during which period democratic processes were hindered by emergency laws and other procedures brought in to ensure security and sovereignty of the nation. Following the end of war in 2009, the 18th amendment was passed in Parliament, abolishing independent commissions, thereby threatening independent and accountable judicial and governing processes.
The post war period up to January 2015 was marked with a period where democracy and human rights were curtailed by the government throughout the country especially in the North and East. During the post war period, the countrys political and social culture transformed into a situation where it was marred with corruption, violence, extremism and thuggery.
There were strong allegations against Sri Lanka, locally and internationally, that both during the long decades of civil war and during the post war period, the Rule of Law was severely threatened leading to a variety of human rights abuses throughout the country, as judiciary and inter related authorities for administration and execution of justice processes were also politically interfered. Freedom and space for expression and freedom for citizens movements were severely threatened, therefore the public did not have access to accurate information and news, and media found it an uphill task to access or disseminate accurate information.
New government
With the establishment of the majority party coalition government in Sri Lanka in 2015, one of the main priorities was to expedite and implement a holistic reconciliation process, which will pave the way for a more united and cohabited population within the country, which is essential for Sri Lanka to reach its development agendas aligned to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. The new government also intended to stabilize and improve Sri Lankas relations with the international world, through implementing a consultative deeply examined and analysed evidence based reconciliation process, which will analyse and address root causes for the long civil conflict, introduce a justice and healing process which will examine and address all human rights abuses and issues which took place during the long years of the civil conflict and post conflict eras in the country.
Examining the painful past, acknowledging it and understanding it, and above all transcending it together, is the best way to guarantee that it does not, and cannot happen again. Based on this cardinal principle, the Government in 2015 appointed the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms. They recorded testimonies of over 7,000 Sri Lankans from around the country, many of them victims of human rights violations. They officially handed over its Final Report on the island-wide public consultations on the design of the Transitional Justice Mechanisms to the Chairperson of the Task Force on of January 3, 2017 at the Presidential Secretariat.
Release the Report
Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms, Chair Manouri Muttetuwegama hands over final report to former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga
Although the Task Force was the brainchild of the Prime Minister and its report praised by Human Rights defenders, the government immediately distanced itself from the report as many members of the government expressed unease about it.
This has resulted in the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms (CTFRM) report not being publicized widely and wide public debate on the report not taking place. The report was only circulated among selected Human Rights defenders.
Therefore, the public knowledge on the report and the role of the Task Force is limited to statements and interpretations of third parties.
Centre for Human Rights (CHR) through its long term interaction with diversified stakeholders, on issues during the civil unrest period and longer term human rights abuses in the country, is of the opinion that it is a priority to create awareness and discussion on the Final Report of the CTFRM among the public.
A constructive debate /dialogue on it among diversified elements of society can be used to understand the content which includes challenges, dilemmas and questions for further dialogue and formulate action plans to implement key recommendations from the Final Report in order to address the issues from the past and gather wider public contribution and engagement towards future reconciliation processes in the country.

Development at what cost
A number of Sri Lankans have become victims of development projects, harassed and their right to live freely been deprived, due to the unplanned development activities that are taking place in Sri Lanka, violating local environmental laws and international conventions.
Although Sri Lankan laws make it mandatory to carry out thorough environmental impact assessments (EIA), before granting approval for large scale development projects, and to adhere to them, it has become common place to use the EIA just as an instrument to get permission from authorities. Most of the EIAs contain false information and projects that are implemented based on these EIAs have devastating effects on communities who are affected by these developments. In the recent years we have seen a number of people, often from the most vulnerable communities, being displaced due to development projects. Why were they displaced It was because the EIAs had not accounted for them, which in itself indicates that the EIA is faulty. Although the public consultation period (when the public can consult the EIA and object to aspects of it) is an important part of the EIA process, most of the recent EIAs skip this process and this has deprived the people the opportunity to protest or object to any aspects of the EIA.
Failed EIAs
People protesting against Uma Oya in Bandarawela.
Uma Oya multi-purpose development project, Colombo Port City Project, Mattala International Airport, extension of the Southern Expressway to Hambantota, Colombo - Kandy highway project and other irrigating schemes are all examples of projects that have been or will be implemented without a proper EIA. None of the EIAs prepared for these projects have gone through the public consultation process and this has ensured that those affected by these projects will have no forum to voice their opposition. Moreover since the EIAs have not taken into account the compensation that needs to be paid for those affected, a large number of victims have to languish in areas unsuitable for habitation for extended periods of time.
The development project that had displaced most people is the Uma Oya multi-purpose scheme. Due to this project 3,700 families from Welimada, Wellawaya, Ella, Bandarawela and Thanamalwila have been displaced due to the destruction of their farmland and the sources of water they used for farming.
Owners of the properties, (houses, land and farms), taken over by the government to implement this project have not yet been systematically (taking into consideration the National Involuntary Resettlement Policy and Land Acquisition Act) compensated. Neither have they been given alternative agricultural lands.
What is most disturbing is the tendency of the state agencies to ignore the protests and lawsuits of those affected by the project. For example, the government has authorized the continuation of the Colombo Port City Project despite the fact that environmentalists have taken legal action against the construction of the Port City. Not only does this project adversely affect the environment but also it endangers the livelihoods of 15,000 fishermen.
Meanwhile settlements and large scale farming projects inside protected areas are continuing although a number of existing legislations explicitly forbid such activities. The creation of settlements in the North and the East, continuation of developmental activities according to the National Physical Plan, construction of expressways, irrigation schemes and handing over large swaths of forest lands to agro-companies like Dole Lanka are recent examples for this. This directly results in communities and small scale farmers losing their water sources that are vital for their survival.
The pressure applied by international financial institutions on the government to adhere to conditions agreed during taking of loans also has an adverse effect on the environment and the peoples rights. Recent moves by the government, to consider water as a commodity, to bring in legislations that turn water into an exchangeable product, to take away the seed rights of the farmers, destroy our seed sovereignty and to lease state land to private enterprises as a way of repaying loans, all indicate that the government is ever willing to follow the instruction of the international financial organisations.
In recent months we have seen the government leasing out forest land to Chinese Companies in exchange for the colossal debts taken from China by the previous administrations. Most of the leased land either belong to small scale farmers, around 1,500 farmers, or were the catchment areas for water sources they used for agriculture.
In other parts of the country the people face immense hardships due to factories that emit toxic waste and are responsible for noise pollution, mini hydro power projects, water bottling factories that tap into ground water and excessive excavation of soil, sand, pebbles, granite and gems.
These have directly affected the peoples ability to live a free and fulfilling life, damaged property and have taken away their water rights.
For example due to the illegal excavation of soil and pebbles a large number of wells have dried out and over 45 people have lost tier lives. The government also used excessive use of force against protestors against Venigros (Pvt) Ltd, whose activities have polluted the water sources of 14 villages, in Ratupaswala. Meanwhile Ambatale water purifying plant has been affected by the release of toxins by Coca Cola Company into Kelani River and the inaction of state agencies have deprived those living near the Kelani River of access to the river water.
We have also noted that there are over 150 mini hydro power projects in operation, without proper permission, and their existence has meant that over 5,000 families are deprived of the access to water and many others are facing the threat of landslides.

Drawn together
The legacy that the British left behind in this land is a tough read. They left behind many things from infrastructure to the Sinhala-only furore. Yet one notable feature of the colonial legacy of Sri Lanka is the verdant vocabulary to illustrate the local culture. This could be said about most colonial countries which are now independent, sovereign, states.
Postcolonial writing shines among them. It has evolved into a subject critically studied at the universities across the globe. As everyone can easily understand, postcolonial writing essentially deals with a literature born following the colonial rule.
Sri Lanka, though not as ample as its neighbour, India, contributed to postcolonial literature in its own way. It later evolved into South Asian Diasporic writings, because of the migration that took place from South Asian countries to other foreign countries such as Australia and Britain. It continues to spread its wings across the world as most writers began sharing their experiences of living in two cultures; one of their motherland and the other of the domiciled country.
Sri Lanka has produced only a handful of writers to this sphere. Chandani Lokuge belongs to that handful. Two of her literary works, If the Moon Smiled and Turtle Nest have been reprinted by Australian Scholarly Publishing in Melbourne.
Lokuge travelled to South Australia in 1996 to complete her doctorate at Flinders University as an Australian Commonwealth Scholar from Sri Lanka. Her study focused on the pioneering Indian womens autobiography and fiction written in English. She obtained her Masters from Peradeniya University for researching English fiction in Sri Lanka with reference to three literati: Leonard Woolf, James Goonewardene and Punyakanta Wijenaike.
Now as Associate Professor of Literary Studies and Creative Writing Programme at Monash University, Lokuge has founded the South Asian Diaspora International Researchers Network. She has co-partnered the network with Dr Mridula Chakraborty, (Deputy Director, Monash Asia Institute, Monash University), Professor Astrid Erll (Institute for English and American Studies at Goethe University Frankfurt), Professor Susheila Nasta, (Chair of Modern Literature at the Open University London, and Editor-in- Chief Wasafiri: The Magazine of International Contemporary Writing), Professor Annalisa Oboe, (English Literature and Postcolonial Studies in the Department of Linguistic and Literary Studies, University of Padua.) Dr Chris Ringrose (School of Languages, Literatures, Cultures and Linguistics, Monash University), Professor Frank Schulze-Engler (Professor of New Anglophone Literatures and Cultures at the Institute for English and American Studies at Goethe University Frankfurt), Professor Klaus Stierstorfer, (Chair of British Studies at Munster University, Germany) and Professor Janet Wilson, (Professor of English and Postcolonial Studies at the University of Northampton; Editor, Journal of Postcolonial Writing, University of Northampton).
The network reaches out to academics and writers who focus on the South Asian Diaspora in their works. With their work on display, the network will offer a creatively and intellectually charged platform to expand a research and educational collaboration.
It will nurture research, teaching and public discussion around and by the South Asian diaspora, and through that, engage in the global debate.
We invite all internationally established scholars as well as early-career, postdoctoral and postgraduates interested in this project to register on this network, and share your innovative research and writing ideas that may lead to important collaborations and connections between the creative, literal, theoretical, institutional, political, social, historical, pedagogical, and the symbolical. This unique international, inter-university and interdisciplinary research platform provides traditional (academic) and non-traditional (creative) researchers with the opportunity to instigate new ways of talking together about the South Asian diaspora, its past, present, and future directions, and highlight the importance of transnational dialogues. Outcomes may include co-authored funding applications and publications, symposia and conferences, and public lectures, Dr Chandani Lokuge notes.
According to the Monash University website, the data generated by this research project will be stored on VicNode via monash.figshare.com, Monash Universitys publicly accessible data repository.
This is a secure and long-term option, which also maximises the discoverability of the data. Both the data and metadata will be searchable via monash.figshare, figshare.com and Google. Each record in monash.figshare will be allocated a DOI, providing a stable and permanent link to the data. In addition, a Research Project will be created in the AustLit database. This will provide a description of different aspects of the research project, for example, archival material and ongoing research. The AustLit record will link to the monash.figshare record, and the data it contains, using the monash.figshare DOI. Similarly, the monash.figshare record will link to the AustLit record via a URL pointing to the AustLit Research Project. This will result in the data being publicly searchable and accessible worldwide, the website adds.
As Deputy Associate Dean, International Engagement from 2013-2014 incl., Chandani Lokuge developed the Monash Joint-Award PhD programme and chaired the Convening Committee of the biennial international conference of the European Association for Studies of Australia (2014). She founded and directed the Monash Centre for Postcolonial Writing from 2002-2011.
Chandani has authored 14 books so far which includes three novels.

## Title: EU boost not enough to revive Sri Lanka garment industry

EU boost not enough to revive Sri Lanka garment industry

Despite a recent move by the European Union to restore Sri Lanka to its highly favorable Generalized System of Preferences Plus program, the country will find it hard to catch up with Bangladesh, which has powered ahead in textile and apparel production in the last few years. Production and labor costs remain high compared to competitors, and analysts are skeptical that the government will be able to meet its goal of doubling exports by 2020.
The EU, which is Sri Lanka's biggest export destination, absorbing some 36% of total shipments, reinstated the country into the GSP Plus program in mid-May, removing import tariffs on more than 6,000 products, including clothing. Sri Lanka was dropped from GSP Plus in 2010 for human rights violations, but remained in the less-favorable GSP program, under which its exports were taxed at 9.6%.
That had had an impact. Total apparel exports fell from $4.7 billion in 2014 to $4.6 billion in 2015 and 2016, according to the Joint Apparel Association Forum, an industry body. Exports to the EU in 2014 stood at $2.1 billion, but dropped to $1.9 billion in 2015 and 2016.
The slump has continued in 2017, with apparel exports falling another 5.8% in the first five months, compared with the same period in 2016. But JAAF adviser K. J. Weerasinghe is fairly optimistic: "We are confident we can now receive at least an additional $400 million worth of orders from the EU initially, which will increase further, now that we have regained GSP Plus," he said. Weerasinghe, and some retailers, said it would not be possible to meet the government's target of doubling exports by 2020, although 2022 was a possibility.
Analysts say that Sri Lanka needs to do more to catch up with countries such as Bangladesh, which is now the world's second-largest clothing exporter after China. Bangladesh accounts for 6.4% of global clothing exports, compared with Sri Lanka's 1.2%.
Part of the reason for this is that Sri Lanka has fallen behind in terms of value chain creation. Bangladesh, for example, has set up spinning mills and knitting mills, which allow manufacturers to cut production costs and improve efficiency. This also puts Bangladesh in a good position to sell large volumes of cheaper apparel such as knitwear, woven shirts, sweaters and sweatshirts.
Amit Gugnani, an analyst at Technopak Advisors, a management consulting company, said Sri Lanka must adopt a similar approach to developing value chain capabilities. "In complete integration, it becomes relatively easier to look at cost engineering across the value chain," he told the Nikkei Asian Review.
Gugnani also suggested that the government should set up textile industrial clusters in the country's north and east by providing investment incentives, as part of the value chain creation.
Another aspect of making production cheaper is to concentrate on remote and backward regions. Wages in Sri Lanka are typically higher than in Bangladesh and Vietnam, making the country better suited to producing high-end garments such as swimwear, trousers and underwear, including lingerie for top brands such as Victoria's Secret.
According to the World Bank's "Stitches to Riches" report, released in April 2016, the minimum monthly wage in Sri Lanka is $120, compared with $70 in Bangladesh. Sri Lankan labor laws also limit factory workers to 57.5 hours per week, with fixed weekly holidays. This compares with Bangladesh's working limit of 60 hours and Vietnam's 64 hours.
Gugnani said Sri Lanka should amend these labor laws. "It's important for Sri Lanka to look at providing lower minimum wages in backward and remote regions ... where the cost of living is comparatively lower," he said. "The industrial clusters in these regions can focus on basic products with minimal value addition and large volumes."
To cut production costs further JAAF has requested exemptions from Sri Lanka's 2% nation-building tax and a 7.5% port and airport development tax on the importation of machinery for the sector. "We don't have a problem with the government taxing our profits, but we have sought an exemption on some taxes for importation of machinery," Weerasinghe said.
Industry participants are also urging the Sri Lankan government to look at reducing duties, offering input tax rebates on raw materials sourced locally, and providing subsidies to factories that improve efficiency, to promote competitiveness with Bangladesh and Vietnam.
Anushka Wijesinha, chief economist of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (which uses an older name for Sri Lanka) said the country must also focus on becoming an easier place to do business. He added: "For a more sustainable and sustained increase we need to focus on competitiveness factors and factors that hold our exporters back -- like standards, bureaucratic and procedural delays."
Wijesinha said the government must help exporters to test products to meet international standards. Also, he urged the government to remove archaic laws such as the need for some exporters to obtain permits for each shipment. Sri Lanka is ranked 110th among 190 economies in terms of the ease of doing business in 2016, slipping one place, according to the latest World Bank annual ratings.
Gladys Lopez-Acevedo, an economist at the World Bank, has another solution. She said that Sri Lanka should explore the idea of exporting more to other countries, including China. "Sri Lanka must look at consolidating its position, and not only focus on higher-end and value-added garments," she said.
To this end, Weerasinghe said the industry was looking at manufacturing shoe uppers, having received interest from a large company in Europe. "We have the potential to diversify and go beyond from our current strengths," he said.
Hasitha Premaratne, chief financial officer of Brandix Lanka, the largest apparel exporter in Sri Lanka, with a customer portfolio that includes Victoria's Secret, Gap, Lands' End, Lane Bryant and Marks and Spencer, agreed that Sri Lanka must diversify. "The country can broaden its horizon into areas such as synthetic products," Premaratne said. "We have a strong presence in innerwear products. However, we could look at the development of our infrastructure in synthetic fabrics as this is a growing global trend."
Aroon Hirdaramani, a director of Hirdaramani Group, a manufacturer for brands including Tommy Hilfiger, Levi Strauss and Nike, said his company started talking a week after the EU announcement to existing customers keen to increase sourcing and new customers looking to place orders. Hirdaramani and Premaratne were both optimistic that Sri Lanka's tighter labor laws and ethical standards could attract more European buyers.

However, Wijesinha said gains from the GSP Plus decision would not start to appear until 2018: "We will become competitive against others, and factories that were slowing down will see a boost in earnings and job creation, but this will not happen overnight. Order books for 2017 are mostly completed already, so we will only begin to see the gains from 2018, 2019 onward."

With global economic recovery remaining on track on the back of better performing emerging economies, growth in India is expected to pick up further in 2017 and 2018, the IMF has said.
"Growth in India is forecast to pick up further in 2017 and 2018, in line with the April 2017 forecast," the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) report on Monday.
"Pick-up in global growth anticipated in the April World Economic Outlook remain .. "While activity slowed following the currency exchange initiative, growth for 2016 -- at 7.1 per cent -- was higher than anticipated due to strong government spending and data revisions that show stronger momentum in the first part of the year," it said, referring to India's demonetisation measure as well as to the base year revisions in GDP calculations made by the Central Statistics Office.

Paris: Fiji rugby stars Josaia Raisuqe and Vuidravuwalu Waisea were arrested in the early hours of Sunday, after allegedly getting into a drunken scuffle outside a Paris nightclub in which a woman claimed she was sexually assaulted.
The players, who are on the books of French Top 14 side Stade Francais, were still in custody on Sunday afternoon after being picked up by police at around 3 a.m., a source said.
A woman alleged that Raisuqe had touched her breasts in a brutal way, the source told AFP.
A fight then broke out between the two players and friends of the young woman.
In a statement, Stade Francais called for Twitter users to exercise caution in their views in the absence of official information. AFP

Fitch has affirmed ratings of 10 Sri Lankan finance companies. They are, Peoples Leasing & Finance, Central Finance Company, Melsta Regal Finance Ltd, HNB Grameen Finance Limited, LB Finance PLC, Siyapatha Finance, Senkadagala Finance, AMW Capital Leasing and Finance, Singer Finance and Mercantile Investments and Finance. In addition, Fitch assigned Siyapathas proposed subordinated debentures an expected rating of BBB+(lka)(EXP).
The rating actions follow Fitchs periodic review of the large and mid-sized finance companies in Sri Lanka.
Fitch expects capitalization in the sector to come under pressure as a result of asset quality pressures stemming from a challenging operating environment and unfavorable weather conditions and declining profitability due to higher funding and credit costs.
Fitch sees that the shift in the business mix of the entities considered in this peer review has become more apparent given the slowdown in the vehicle financing segment following the increase in import tariffs, imposition of lower allowable loan-to-value ratios coupled with a high interest rate environment.

Hip Hop phenomenon
Ashanthi, the Queen of Sri Lankan Hip Hop Music is a Sri Lankan musical phenomenon. One of the most powerful singers in the music industry in Sri Lanka, Ashanthi is the youngest and only female in the island to be signed to an internationally recognized record label  Universal Music. She has toured the globe creating music that thrills audiences. Melodies features Ashanthi, the number one contemporary female music icon of Sri Lanka.
When it comes to writing lyrics for my songs, what inspires me is anything around me such as any situation I feel I need to write about, and anything that comes from my heart as well. It needs to be something I feel very strongly about. The things I try to convey in my lyrics  I dont try and force something to come out, it is always something natural that happens organically and flows organically and that has an artistic touch to it, when I write it. If I am on a tangent of writing and I feel the best time for my creativity happens in the night. So I get up in the middle of the night and jot some things down. Or I have one thought and it develops from there, said Ashanthi.
For Ashanthi it is a process of learning on the go right throughout. She has spent almost 20 years in music.
For me, music and creativity is a process, of learning and keeping on learning as you go. Because every day you learn new things. And every day new things come into play. There are things that keep evolving and changing so much in the music industry  if you take the sounds from 10 years ago and compare it to the sounds now, it is very different. So you need to understand these different levels of music and how they affect people and how people react to it. You have to have a good relationship with music to understand it. I try and have a good relationship with my music and to understand what my audience likes to listen to and what the current trends are and how it sounds and how we can revolutionize the Sri Lankan music industry with the influence of the Western Music Industry, bringing new sounds to our industry as well, explained Ashanthi
Ashanthi feels that what she has achieved right now, her success was not forced. It was very organic.
I was just a girl who wanted to do a lot of stuff in the music industry. I just wanted to make sure that I leave my mark in the industry. I have built on that from my first song to whatever I have done up to now. It has always been making one better that the other, added Ashanthi.
Ashanthis brand of music is mostly pop if you could give it a wide scope in terms of genre.
But if you narrow it down a little bit more it would be Hip Hop & R&B. Hip Hop is very close to my heart. It is a cool form of expression in music with the rap, beats and the rhythms. The way hip hop works it really connects with the youth. R&B is a really nice flavor to bring in vocally through music and melody. The combination of those two really work for me. When I was a kid that was the kind of music I focused on and listened to, pointed out Ashanthi.
When it comes to inspirations in music, if it is an international artiste, from the time she was a kid she first listened to Mariah Carey.
I listened to her first tape and I played that tape over and over again. Being an R&B singer I am self- taught, so I followed her technique and I followed other bands such as Boyz II Men. So when I was growing up that kind of R&B music really influenced me. And another big influence in my life is my mom. She is a famous Sri Lankan Pop and Jazz singer, Antoinette De Alwis. So I had constant training on the go. I received formal training under Mrs. Maryanne David. I was with the Merry An singers for almost six years, probably more. I was one of the youngest members in her professional choir. It was fun and challenging for me. Even as a kid I always loved a challenge. I am very ear trained, if someone sings me the line that I am supposed to sing I can memorize it by ear, and I will be able to sing it. I will never forget it. So that is how learnt how to sing classical music, stated Ashanthi.
Ashanthis is very choosy about who she collaborates with.
As an artiste if you are trying to build up your image as an icon, and if you want to maintain a certain uniqueness, you need to be careful about what collaborations you do make. It is about how they gel with your music as well. I have done collaborations with Bhathiya and Santhush, Umaria and a few other local artistes. And I have done some collaborations with international artistes for my English Album Rock the World- such as Reshmuno the biggest English R&B star in Malaysia. Then there is Benny Dayal from India. He is a really famous singer in India, one of the best playback singers in India. He sings in Tamil and Hindi and maybe other languages. He sang in Sinhalese for my Album. We did a song called Lets give peace a chance, he sang in English, Sinhala, Hindi and Tamil. I have done a collaboration with Raxstar, he is really big in the UK Asian Market.
I recently went to the UK on tour, I did this festival called Beats without Boundaries. It was to showcase South Asian Music in the UK. They got top artistes from all the South Asian Countries. I met artistes from Bangladesh and Afghanistan. There we were allowed to collaborate with an artiste of our choice and make Music. So I collaborated with a guy called Rapid and he is from a group called the Ruff Sqwad. So it was really different. I have never attempted to go into the genre of grime music. It was looking into a different kind of music and style, elucidated Ashanthi.

IATA agents fear other airlines may zero-rate commission like SriLankan
Airline ticketing agents are in a quandary after the national carrier SriLankan Airlines cut commission on air tickets to zero on July 1.
Zero commission will be very tough on agencies, big and small, said IATA (International Air Transport Association) Sri Lanka President and George Steuarts Travels Director/CEO Channa Wijemanne.
About 90% of SriLankans business is driven through agents whose income is derived from the commission they receive.
IATA agents fear other airlines may adopt SriLankans new policy of zero-rating commission. I only hope and pray other airlines dont follow suit, said Wijemanne.
He said agents dont just sell tickets. They also assist passengers with passport and visa formalities, the latter a particular hassle for Sri Lankan citizens. Meeting these overheads minus the income from commission will be a tough call.
We do all the spadework for SriLankan; we contribute a lot to the national carrier. Where do we earn the money for these services How are we to pay staff and meet other expenditure, asked Wijemmane.
Thai Airways, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways have also zero-rated commissions. Emirates has slashed commissions from 7% to 3%.
SriLankan steadily decreased the commission on air tickets from 7% to 5% to 2% and finally to zero.
The zero-rating was to happen in April but was postponed after IATA agents negotiated with the airline. A second meeting last June proved unfruitful for agents with the airline determined to enforce zero-rating from July 1.
The silver lining in the cloud is that the flag carrier has promised agents to look at alternatives like performance-based incentives to offset the loss of commission. Airlines like Qatar Airways and Etihad do offer such incentives.
We are confident that the airline will recognize our contribution and offer suitable incentives. The national carrier and agents must work hand-in-hand in this matter, said Wijemanne.
Agents will also obviously look at promoting airlines that offer commission instead of SriLankan, Wijemanne said.
He however conceded that SriLankan is the largest airline operating out of the island, particularly to regional giants India and China to which the island is looking to grow its economy; that in effect means SriLankan constitutes the agents bottomline. How matters will pan out remains to be seen, particularly in face of the governments intention to make an announcement about the proposed privatization of SriLankan.

Los Angeles: John Kundla, a Hall of Fame coach who led the Minneapolis Lakers to five NBA titles before the team moved to Los Angeles, died Sunday. He was 101.
Kundla, the original coach of the Lakers NBA franchise, had been in a Minneapolis assisted living facility in recent years.

Lanka to amend Financial Transactions Reporting Act
Sri Lanka still grappling with numerous money laundering activities has taken steps to introduce necessary amendments to the Financial Transactions Reporting Act (FTR) and to address various other issues relating to the legal framework.
Nevertheless, despite gaps still exist in the money laundering and terrorist financing regulations, Sri Lanka has made great progress in combating and regulating money laundering in the recent past, In 2006, Sri Lanka underwent a mutual evaluation from the Asia, Pacific Group on money
laundering (APG), Central Bank, Finance Intelligence Unit Director Dr. H. Amaratunga said.
Noting that the government is careful of taking actions with the global community to tackle these growing problems, Amaratunga added that Sri Lanka will continue to focus on creating more effective and stricter rules and regulations in this regard.
With the improvement of the financial system, it is necessary to be mindful of numerous illegal activities taking place in tandem with the monetary system.
Meanwhile, Gordon Hook, Executive Secretary of Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) noted that the human, wildlife trafficking and other threats emanating from various other illegal activities pose huge challenges to the global community and the law enforcement authority.
He further noted that countries including Sri Lanka need to have better access to sophisticated technology while adopting policies and measures to counter money laundering and terrorist financing activities domestically.
Sri Lanka has passed numerous laws dealing with combating money laundering. In 2005 and 2006, Sri Lanka passed three important acts related to money laundering. The Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act,
The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, and The Financial Transactions Reporting Act (FTR).
Sri Lanka hosted the 20th Annual Meeting of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) in Colombo last week , which saw the participation of around 450 local and foreign delegates from the APGs 41 member countries and several international observers.

Lanka Sathosa seeks to clear name of cocaine deal
Lanka Sathosa yesterday sought to clear its name in relation to the recent find of cocaine in a sugar container delivered to its warehouse as Industry and Commerce Minister Rishard Bathuideen insisted that Police investigate into how the cocaine came to be delivered to its Economic Centre.
Police as well as employees of Sathosa have scrambled to take credit for the detection of around 218 kg of cocaine on 19 July.
Sathosa has 137 registered suppliers. Having called for tenders, we chose Ranjitha Pulses to supply 500 metric tons of sugar to us. Their lorry delivered the sugar to us on 19 July. It was when our employees broke the Customs seal and started transferring bags that the cocaine was detected. I asked them to inform it to the closest police station, Lanka Sathosa Chairman TMKB Tennakoon said addressing the media at the Government Information Department.
He said neither the employees nor the officials have any connection to the drugs. They opened what the Customs had sealed, he said. Police arrested seven suspects in connection with the haul, including the container driver and two workers of the Economic Centre who had stolen two packets of cocaine from the container. The value of the cocaine is Rs. 3.2 billion.
Sugar Importers Association Vice President Nihal Seneviratne said it was in June last year that they had the first detection of cocaine from a sugar container imported from Brazil.
The importer was arrested as a suspect in the case. He was released with no charges, eight months later, Seneviratne said.
Since then, the Association has insisted that sugar imports from Brazil be stopped, he said.
About 600,000 metric tons of sugar is imported per year, out of which 60-65 percent comes from Brazil.
This shipment was from Brazil. But it had come to the country in November last year. We have another 70 such containers with Customs, Sugar Importers Association Media Spokesperson Hemaka Fernando said.
The Association asked Police and the Customs to inspect the containers and clear them of any suspicion, but they are yet to receive any response, he said.
Meanwhile, local wholesalers voiced concerns to the minister over the risk of purchasing sugar. The Minister in reply said that the importers would take responsibility for any contraband they deliver to wholesalers.
These drugs are smuggled at transshipment points. Most containers which were caught had short transshipment times. It is possible that the dealers did not have time to switch the goods, said Fernando who stressed that it was up to the authorities to ensure that containers coming into the country are drugs free.
The Customs in 2015 announced that they were looking to install a container scanning system to improve the efficiency of Customs detections. They are yet to install such a system. The Customs processes about 1,100 import containers daily out of which 10 to 15 percent randomly selected containers are subjected to x-ray scanning.

Maldives President shuts Parliament
Maldives lawmakers were locked out of Parliament on Monday after President Abdulla Yameen ordered it shut to prevent a vote to impeach his Speaker, the opposition said, in the latest turmoil to grip the troubled honeymoon islands. Parliament had been expected to hear a No-Confidence Motion against the Speaker, Abdulla Masheeh, but MPs found their way blocked, the Maldivian Democratic Party said.
Party spokesman Hamid Abdul Ghafoor added several opposition MPs broke through the military cordon only to be pepper sprayed and evicted.
On Monday morning the gates of the parliament were padlocked by members of the armed forces and MPs were forcibly prevented from entering the parliamentary compound, the opposition party said in a statement. There was no immediate comment from the government.
The opposition this month secured enough support from government defectors to begin impeachment proceedings against the speaker, in a bid to wrest control of parliament from Yameen before presidential elections next year. The government has repeatedly tried to frustrate these efforts.- AFP

Media for national integration
In just over five months time, we will be celebrating the 100th anniversary of Ceylon Daily News. D.R. Wijewardena, the newspaper magnate of Sri Lanka, commenced the publication of this newspaper on January 3,1918. As a successful entrepreneur, he established Lake House newspapers and played a major role in the national integration and the independence movement, particularly through his newspapers.
Hence, it seems an appropriate moment to examine the role of our present media and how they can play their part in promoting national integration. Often referred to as part of the Fourth Branch of the Government, there is no doubt that if caution is not exercised, the media can work as a double-edged sword capable of cutting through any social or political armour.
In recognition of this crucial role, President Maithripala Sirisena has consistently requested the media to desist from propagating inflammatory statements likely to foment divisions and ethnic hatred. In fact, many times certain Sri Lankan journalists in their pursuit of the so-called press freedom, have adopted an aggressive attitude towards the government by writing news reports that were harmful to the national interest.
Media ethics
It is a simple matter of ethics! Journalism ethics and standards comprise principles of ethics and of good practice as applicable to the specific challenges faced by journalists. This subset of media ethics is widely known to journalists as their professional code of ethics.
We do have a Code of Ethics for Journalists issued by the Press Council in 1981. We also have a more updated Code of Professional Practice of the Editors Guild of Sri Lanka and Free Media Movement adopted by the Sri Lanka Press Institute.
Director General of Government Information recently said that the present Government will set up an independent commission for media sector. Among other matters, Commission is expected to introduce a new code of ethics for journalists.
The western media, which is the envy of many journalists, is also guided by their own set of codes. For example, take the code suggested by Hutchins Commission in 1947. Their guidelines were set up around two important ideas. The first is that whoever enjoys a special measure of freedom, like a professional journalist, has an obligation to society to use their freedoms and powers responsibly. The second that was established is societys welfare is paramount, more important than individual careers or even individual rights.
The Hutchins Commission added another five guidelines. (1) Present meaningful news, accurate and separated from opinion. (2) Serve as a forum for the exchange of comment and criticism and to expand access to diverse points of view. (3) Project a representative picture of the constituent groups in society by avoiding stereotypes by including minority groups. (4) Clarify the goals and values of society; implicit was an appeal to avoid pandering to the lowest common denominator. (5) Give broad coverage of what was known about society.
Hutchins Commission realized the importance of the medias role in national unity and integration and accordingly included as the third guideline that media should reflect the diversity of the religious and racial cultures they represent. These guidelines inspired Society of Professional Journalists (USA) to adapt it in 1996 as the current version of media ethics.
Experiences
It is ironic that some of our journalists pretend to be oblivious to the devastating effects of reckless reporting when they had abundant examples of the role the media had played in major conflicts in the world. The case of the Rwandan genocide is an instructive one. The death of Rwandan President in a plane crash in April 1994, triggered off a genocide against Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
A United Nations tribunal set afterwards established that some media executives played a key role in inciting ethnic killings. The tribunal established that hate media played a significant role in the genocide in which some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were murdered.
In Kenya, some media spread hate messages which created atrocities and led to genocides in early 90s. Kosovo, a province of the former Yugoslavia, in 1999, when tens of thousands of civilians were kidnapped, raped, tortured, and killed in ethno-political violence pitting Serbs against Kosovar Albanians. Later investigations have revealed that media had played a substantial role in the incitement of both parties.
History reveals many more examples.
The monitoring of some segments of Sri Lankan media reveals that inflammatory coverage does not necessarily consist of a direct call to violence, but instead takes the form of indirect terminology that still has dangerous potential to foment conflict. Current regulatory and self-regulatory efforts designed to prevent media incitement to violence have, thus far, been insufficient. Lessons learned from post-conflict Bosnia, Kosovo and Iraq can assist us in creating our own legal and self-regulatory mechanisms to limit inflammatory media coverage.
There are a wide range of measures to mitigate inflammatory media coverage, including targeted training for media and government officials, broad support for a professional code of conduct, a full review of existing legislation relating to incitement, and the creation of a lexicon of inflammatory terms with guidelines for the proper use of these terms.
Truth
Unfortunately, given the present rapidity of communication in Sri Lanka and the perception that dramatized news sells, there seems to be little appetite for withholding or de-sensationalizing information even in times of conflicts.
Additionally, we have also seen two negative developments in Sri Lanka in recent years, despite the undeniable benefits of the information revolution, the increasing partisanship reflected in some media means prejudices are reinforced and a flood of unverified statements and deliberate misinformation has muddied the publics efforts to learn the truth. It is hard to claim, therefore, that technological advances in the media by themselves had promoted peace.
Isms
Today, almost eight years after the end of the war Sri Lanka has been still unable to secure stable peace and national integration. The need for national integration is required today more than ever before. At this juncture when a greater degree of reconciliation between national communities exists, any relapse into the status quo that prevailed during the last regime would be a national calamity. Unfortunately, there are signs of a resurgence of communal animosity and the media should take the lead in preventing it.
The four isms communalism, religious fundamentalism, regionalism and linguism have always been the bane of our nation since we gained independence. President Maithripala Sirisena constituted Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation when the New Government came to power to find out ways and means to combat these very forces. The Ministrys website does not give much information to make an evaluation whether noteworthy steps have been taken to address these problems.
We all know how religious fundamentalism, in any of its forms can harm the country and the national sentiment. They do erode the essence of nationalism - the love for the nation, identification with the national sentiment, the sense of patriotism.
Patriotism is the soul of a nation. When patriotism dies, a nation loses the love and loyalty of its people, and then the nation dies and begins to decompose. Patriotism is not nation-worship, it is not even the denigration of other races or religions above ones own. It is an attachment to ones own country  its land, its people, its past, its heroes, literature, language, traditions, culture, and customs.
There are people in this country who hold an exclusive view of religion which drives them into sectarian frenzy that does not admit tolerance of other. Despite a shared culture of so many years, linguistics diversities have often generated tensions and conflicts among different communities threatening the fabric of national unity.
The same holds good for regionalism aggravated no doubt by inequitable development amongst different regions of this country. All the above forces and factors do pose a challenge to Sri Lankas national integration and therefore conscious efforts will have to be made by all concerned to preserve the same.
Media can help in the exposure to all the cultures of different regions. Thus, bringing the whole country together as one nation. Media can play a distinguished role in the society. Whenever there are crises in the country media can play a part as a tool of crises management.
Whenever there are forces working against the integrity and solidarity of Sri Lanka, it is the responsibility of the media to perform as a tool of information between the government and the masses. Media need to act as a watchdog that has an eye on everything in the society, to tell the good and bad to the society.

Memories of school cricket in the sixties
Old Anandian cricketer Prasanna de Silva who is in Melbourne and I represented Ananda at school cricket in the sixties. When requested by me to reminisce about our good old cricketing days at school, he cranked up all his memory wheels upstairs to emerge with some incidents that happened during our matches.
Prasanna stated that our friendship went way back into the fifties when myself and he played for the under 14 team in 1958, captained by Nissanka Wanigasundara who was a superb all-rounder. Unfortunately his cricket career was nipped in the bud as he came down with polio; this was unfortunate because he really would have gone on to represent Ceylon.
We somehow graduated to the under 16 and first XI teams thereafter. Prasanna adds that cricket in the sixties was unadulterated pleasure there were no sledging! Of course, there was good natured banter, and bouncers galore. He can well remember the 1964 Ananda-Dharmaraja encounter at the Police grounds in Kandy. In the sixties Dharmaraja had a reputation of building up ace fast bowlers like Kehelgamuwa and Sonny Yatawara, later Yatawara played for Ananda. Prasanna states that we did not have the trauma of facing Yatawara; however I had the fortune of bowling to Yatawara, when he was having a knock in front of the Nalanda pavilion. I volunteered to bowl to him and he straight drove my off break back to me which I misfielded and hit me smack on the shin. I was writhing in pain and he was so nice that he escorted me to the first aid room straight away for attention.
In 1964 the Rajans had another pair of pace bowlers Twin Terrors, in the form of S.U. Mendis and Daya Jayasundera. Prasanna was the last man in and by some miracle managed to survive 3 balls bowled by a spinner. The next over was a maiden, even though he was stuck at his end and he had to face Mendis while he was passing him said to him in a friendly manner, Machang if you survive the first two balls the third will be a bouncer. He did survive the first two balls even though the first was a sizzling yorker. He was taking no chances with the third even before the ball was bowled he dropped his bat and ducked low while covering his head with both hands and elbows. He surely was no batsman but may have been a great entertainer as there was a roar of laughter around the ground! He was spared further agony as he was clean bowled off the next ball; the sound of the shattering timber was sweet music to his ears. He was glad to return to the pavilion with all his body parts intact.
Prasanna recollects providing more amusement to the Kandy spectators while fielding. Tilak was bowling his flighted off spinners to Rajans star bat G.S. Ratnayake. He was fielding at long on. G.S. waltzed down the pitch and played a mighty lofted shot towards long on where he was fielding. He still remembers the pounding of his heart as he watched the ball and all the while moving back to cling to a neat catch. There was a roar from the crowd and plenty of clapping, he was pleased with himself. He was beaming and looking at his team mates expecting them to come running to him to congratulate. Not a soul moved and even the batsmen was motionless at the crease, then to his utter dismay, he noticed the umpire signalling a six and boy was my face red in fact I had back peddled a good five to six feet behind the boundary line. By the end of the match I redeemed myself taking four wickets including Gotabays one.
Prasanna finally mentions about another off the field happy event that was etched in his memory. At the time, it was customary to host the team for dinner after every match. His turn to host the dinner was after the St Peters-Ananda match. At the time, he was living in Vajira Road and Charith Gunasena who played for St Peters was his back door neighbour. His mother suggested that he invite Charith too which he happily did, however Charith did not turn up we (the Ananda team mates) had dinner and was having a sing song which was not going well. Then at about 10.30 or so Charith came and sheepishly apologised for the delay and asked if it was okay if a few of his team mates could come too. Of course they readily invited them as there was plenty of food available.
Prasanna remembers who his friends were, they were Darrel Wimalratne, Aubrey Patternot, Peter and Steven de Neise and Charith whose younger brother Gamini was named after their famous uncle Gamini Goonasena, a champion leg spinner for Cambridge University. After the Peterites did good justice for the remaining food, they got back to their singing session. Peter de Niese who was a superb pianist started playing it. The baila and the sing song session went very well until the wee hours of the morning.
The friendship we formed then, not just with our teammates but also with the players of other schools have withstood the test of time and have jelled even stronger. Prasanna thanks those wonderful friends for their friendship and enriching lives with wonderful memories. School cricket undoubtedly moulded them to face the rigours of later life, but even more importantly it gave them so much of joy and happiness in their later years. It is rather unfortunate to curtail Prasannas interesting article due to space limitations. As they say all good things must come to an end.
I have mixed feelings about the school cricket we went through in the sixties, from the age of thirteen onwards, all I did was attend practices, and during the off season played for the club called Silver Sports Club which we formed with the neighbours around Cotta Road Borella. My studies were left in the back burner and socialising with other students was kept to a minimum. As a result, in my life after school I had to slog hard to raise my head above the water but my love for cricket will never die.

Microsoft Paint avoids brush with death

Microsoft has confirmed that it will continue to offer its graphics program Paint.
In a recent update, it had listed Paint as a feature that would be either removed or no longer developed.
Paint, renowned for its simplicity, has been part of the Windows operating system since its launch in 1985.
Microsoft suggested it would not remain on Windows 10 by default but did say it would be available for free on the Windows Store.
Its successor, Paint 3D, will be part of the Windows 10 package.
There had been an outpouring of support for the program on social media, following the publication of the list on 24 July.
"If there's anything we learned, it's that after 32 years, MS Paint has a lot of fans,"Microsoft wrote in a blog.
"It's been amazing to see so much love for our trusty old app."
There does not appear to have been a similar reprieve for other features onthe list of casualties.
These included the Outlook Express email client, now replaced by Mail.

An Ordinary Day..!
She was beautiful!
Now, she lay lifeless: Her fight with cancer; over. Victorious, shed moved away from pain, to a life where I could feel her smile somewhere in the heavens. I had visited her as shed battled with the terrible disease that devoured chunks of her young life everyday. Then one day, while holding her hand and silently crying Id asked, Tell me what you miss the most
Shed looked at me with those beautiful expressive eyes of hers and whispered, What I miss is an ordinary day!
At thirty-five shed been a success in business, but it wasnt the excitement of a business deal she missed. She, was a young mother, but it was not the success of a childs report card she missed.
She missed an ordinariness of a normal day.
Rain and potholes. Delays and missed appointments. Grumbling and cross words. Sleepy afternoons, maybe wide-awake nights. All these the trappings of an ordinary day!
I leave her and walk slowly away, pondering, how needed her message for us today. How can we start enjoying our ordinary days
First a spirit of thankfulness, a cry of joy, a leap in the air, that we are alive and well. Oh God! let our hearts and voices cry out, How grateful we are, we are alive and kicking! Let that thankfulness bring a smile of joy, nay laughter to us right now.
And then a sense of purpose. Even as we drive past potholes, with purpose we avoid them. But more than just that, a passionate purpose for the day. What job shall I do well today Whose life can I make better Which dream of mine can I make bigger Ah the joy of purpose. And then setting forth to walk, and run and blaze towards the light of hope at the end of the tunnel, victorious!
And what else on an ordinary day like today, but to enjoy it! Not looking always for excitement, but enjoying the laughter of your child, your children as they spill your tea, even the nagging of a concerned wife or husband, the waiting, as a punctured tire is fixed, the delay of train or plane. Let worry be brushed aside, and those moments thrust on us, give us time to slow down, relax and enjoy.
Shes gone, and her beautiful smile after which she was named, looks down, Tell them, to enjoy an ordinary day, and when they do, Bob uncle, I have not lived in vain!

Original Lakers coach Kundla dead at 101
Los Angeles: John Kundla, a Hall of Fame coach who led the Minneapolis Lakers to five NBA titles before the team moved to Los Angeles, died Sunday. He was 101.
Kundla, the original coach of the Lakers NBA franchise, had been in a Minneapolis assisted living facility in recent years.
On behalf of the entire Lakers organization, Id like to express our sadness at the passing of John Kundla, Lakers president and co-owner Jeanie Buss said in a statement.
John played an important role in the history of the Lakers organization. Not only was he a Hall of Fame coach, he was our first head coach and led the organization to five NBA championships.
In addition to his numerous contributions to the Lakers and our legacy, John was a wonderful man and will be remembered fondly.
Kundla was only 31 years old when he guided the Lakers in 1948 as they signed center George Mikan, the star who powered the club to five NBA crowns from 1949-1954.
It was Kundla and Mikan that began the tradition of success which evolved through the move to California, such stars as Wilt Chamberlain and Jerry West, Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and later Kobe Bryant and Shaquille ONeal.
Kundla was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1995 and in 1996 for the NBAs 50th anniversary was named one of the leagues 10 greatest coaches.
Kundla had a career record of 423-302 with the Lakers before resigning in 1959, the year before the team moved to Los Angeles. He went on to coach at University of Minnesota after that, going 110-105. AFP

Peterites lend a hand and a heart
To lend a hand and lend heart for a worthy cause the students their parents teachers and well wishes of St Peters collage joined a walkathon on July 1. The walk was organised by the school Development Committee.
The main aim of the walk was to raise funds to construct an IT Laboratory, a state of the art auditorium with seating for 300 viewers, refurbish the college Science Laboratory which needs to be equipped with modern facilities to suit the present era and construct a fully equipped sports pavilion complex in the college grounds. Principle Rev. Father Trevor Martin the tutorial staff and parents along with present and past students made a great commitment for this project. Turning the pages back to the history of this premier catholic school which began in 1922, we see that in all eras the school has been blessed with leaders, who had great visions for the development of the school.
St.Peters promotes integral education creating an environment for students to build character fit for leaders who would in the future sphere head the social economic and political arena of Sri Lanka. Many projects have been initiated under the guidance of Rev.Fr Trevor Martin. The most popular is the mini- prize giving where children are motivated to reach for excellence given recognition for making the effort and awarded accordingly.

## Title: Phew! Naked view to survive an interview!
## Supertitle:

Phew! Naked view to survive an interview!
The difficulty with job interviews is that so much advice is published on how to survive them - if youre the interviewee that is. Even seasoned interviewees occasionally get butterflies. Being nervous weighs you down, makes the interview seem interminable and makes you look uptight. More importantly, it prevents you from being who you are.
Although being nervous is not something you can easily control, you can learn to mask it. I was offered some tips in this regard from a job-hopping uncle who actually created a record of sorts in the pursuit of professions. Uncle Roger, later known as Dodger, secured more than 30 jobs in an astoundingly successful and chequered career. As a rolling stone he adroitly leapfrogged all opposing contenders with the panache of an athlete of Olympian magnitude.
mental image
I was a callow youth at the time when Roger advised me that I could clip the wings of the butterflies and reinforce my sense of superiority with a little imagination. The advice he advocated was simple yet bizarre. He insisted that I should picture my interviewers without clothes. Uncle Roger conveying a peculiarly deadpan expression propounded his theory thus: All it takes is a little imagination, my boy. You simply have to conjure a mental image of the persons holding your future in their hands in their birthday suits. I emphasize nude, as starkers under their clothes, do you understand
I nodded in reluctant agreement while he went on to clarify the importance of visualizing the big-shot inquisitors in their natural state: And if you feel the interview is going nowhere, or the employers are rude or trying to be patronizing just give them hell. Kick them up their  well you-know-where  and get the hell out of there. Its the image, dear boy, or rather the satisfaction of stripping them of that image of all-powerful control in your mind that counts most. And when I say projecting them in the raw, I mean the ultra form of unconcealed raw that has come to be commonly accepted as buck naked. Get it he barked.
I nodded again in acquiescence. After all he had been the undisputed champion of all roving job-seekers and a darn successful one at that. And in similarity to Julius Caesars immortal Veni, Vidi, Vici (I came, I saw, I conquered) Rogers line with a slight amendment should have read: I came. I worked. I vanished.
corpulent bullies
Having tried to practice the maestros technique, I must say quite honestly, that I am not quite sure this advice actually works to your advantage all the time. What I mean is it works sometimes, such as when I was alone in the ring with a quartet of grossly corpulent bullies with slack jaws and even slacker blancmanging bellies and bottoms. They were all confrontational and offensive. I had already decided I was not going to work for this gang of goons at any cost.
Rogers theory was rather simple really. All you had to do was permit your vision to do a complete unabbreviated full undress-rehearsal on all high-flying interrogators.
The only problem I had at that interview was not being able to stifle my mirth and laughing out loud at my own perceptive vision of the shapeless slobs in the buff while pointing my finger at their pathetic flaccid endowments. After all, it was my rascal Uncle Rogers technique, of viewing the world of corporate frivolity unclothed in all its undisguised threadbare magnificence or rather threadbare insignificance.
But it is a whole different kettle of fish when you face a panel comprising solely women. I was a successful managing editor then and I imagined I had developed a persona of calm, focused authority. That was until I attended an interview at a top-selling womens publication in Hong Kong for a job as a humour columnist. I strode briskly into the board room to find I was alone in the ring with a quartet of sophisticated and vivacious career women.
itchy forefinger
The enchanting interviewers all stood up and shook my hand. I restrained my itchy forefinger from its accustomed palm tickling fixation. One of them, a buxom beauty thrusting a dainty hand said: Hello, Im Talula, and went on to introduce her colleagues. Talula resembled a delectable gelatine dessert. She even moved like a delicious jelly with a grace and expressiveness that was accentuated by her ample curves. My mind waxed poetic as she sashayed back to her chair. Talula does the hula. Alleluia! I thought to myself. She outshone them all this exotic jolly jelly, with the equally exciting exotic name.
I eased myself into a chair opposite. The entire bevy resembled huntresses having spotted their prey. I tried to calm my nerves by thinking of them as naked prey, but only for a moment. I knew I was on pretty precarious ground, treading on decidedly feminine preserves. I tried to expunge any thoughts of Uncle Rogers undraping techniques from my minds eye. In this case I was doing so with extreme difficulty.
They asked about how I would rise to a challenge. Only a quarter of my thoughts had actually been on the conversation.
I came out of my sensuous reverie and said: I beg your pardon One of them smiled benignly and repeated: How would you rise to a challenge with a suicidal deadline I answered honestly: In more ways than one. Mainly by an upsurge of inspiration. And thats the naked truth.
They had the grace to blush and cross their pretty legs as if in choreographed accord. That gave me the chance to retract my own relaxed, outstretched posture and cross my extremities as well.
They seemed perceptive as well, the entire shebang of this corporate covey and appeared to be reading my mind. They looked at one another smiling slyly. This was Talulas cue. She grinned mischievously and said: Just one more question. It may sound unconventional but besides your column you will also have to undertake some speaking assignments on our behalf.
The question is to test your presence of mind. Do you mind
Okay shoot! I fired back. Blushing slightly Talula posed the million dollar-a-year question: What part of your body would you hide if you were on the street completely naked
I hesitated for a split second before returning fire in a blaze of inspiration: My face, obviously, so no one would know its me! The beautiful bevy clapped their dainty hands in approval.

Galle: India have ruled opening batsman Lokesh Rahul out of the first Test against Sri Lanka starting Wednesday due to viral fever.
Rahul, who scored a half-century in a two-day warm-up match last week, stayed in Colombo as the rest of the squad practised in Galle.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India said Monday that Rahul has no major health concerns but will miss the first Test as a precautionary measure.

The 25-year-old averages over 44 in 17 Tests since making his debut for India against Australia at Melbourne in 2014. He has scored four hundreds and seven half-centuries.
Shikhar Dhawan, who replaced injured Murali Vijay in the 16-man squad for the three-Test series, and Abhinav Mukund are the other openers in the Indian squad. India, the world number one side, are to play three Tests in Sri Lanka. AFP

Rain on the buds
National Institute for the Improvement of Children's Literature was proposed by the academia and educationists in the country recently to promote the reading habit among children.
The proposal came with the commemoration of Munidasa Cumaratunga's service and to mark his birthday (July 25, 1887).
The main functions of this institute,it was proposed, would be to help writers and work together with them to promote reading habit among children; develop children's literature; identify creative skills and literary forms that enable the child to grasp innovative competencies; serve as a national and international organization and as a centre for cooperative activities among other relevant bodies; hold seminars, workshops, discussions and to carryout awareness programmes; publicize, educate, research and help such activities and financing and leading; serve as a central body in the present library network to disseminate relevant publications' make literacy development activities and programmes through schools, public libraries and other organizations and to launch collaborative programmes with relevant organizations to develop inter-cultural relations, ethnic cohesion and pluralism.
Society needs creative people for cultural, product and service development. Bringing a society to a higher standard of creative ability in literature is a uphill task for a country such as Sri Lanka where the traditional west-oriented educational pattern is predominant. World history has proved that any civilization with creative people is independent.
Literary creativeness can be developed by improving reading consciousness of children from their childhood. Therefore, implementing a children's literature programme is timely. The outcome of the venture is to enhance not only the creative ability of children in literature, but also in science and technology.
Children should have an understanding of their country, such as its socioeconomic, historical and geographic aspects, as well as cultural and national values. When they become responsible citizens, they can decide what society needs and work accordingly. They would understand their responsibilities and their elders.
Better reading patterns
They would learn to respect norms and values in society and for them, racial disparity would be insignificant. In a society with people who value literature, it is easy to improve character and capabilities of children in innovation, loving kindness, brotherhood, tolerance, self-esteem, morality, and educational and worldly attainments.
It is needed to observe the avenues to develop children's literacy activity that lays the foundation for a better reading pattern. Therefore, reading as well as information and communication literacy coupled with moral values would make children fit for the emerging ethical and knowledge societies.
In this respect, the mass media can play a major role. The library service should be used to improve readership and creativity among children. The library system in Sri Lanka has two parallel services; the public and the school.
In this respect, the collection of children's literature should be balanced, multiple and pluralistic to offer a better library service for the juvenile.
The writers must have a sound understanding to produce literary works to fulfill the interests of children and to use a simple language style to explain stories and incidents which inculcate good characteristics and abilities in children.
Many of our writers in juvenile literature use a language which is more suited for adults. Munidasa Cumaratunga. Martin Wickramasinghe and Ven. S. Mahinda Thera used a simple linguistic pattern during the 1920s and 1960s'. The contribution made by later writers is appreciable. Our writers have a great opportunity to make use of the literary tradition devised by Munidasa Cumaratunga and the like.
Literary forms such a translations, short stories, folklore, culture and national history are important. Adapted works from science writings and works on other cultures are also useful to make children have a balanced mind. In India, a device called Talking books have significantly improved children's reading skills. Patriotism is promoted through the epics of Mahabharata, Ramayana, Jathaka and biographical stories such as Mahatma Gandhi and other writings available from the Indian literary market. Children have been well trained in reading, and guided to improve their reading skills in developed countries.
The United States, Russia, Japan and China are some examples. Reading is done with the help of audio-visual material and other illustrative aids such as handbooks, pictorials illustrative and comical items, paintings, maps, the internet and modern IT technologies.
Sound library framework
The collection of children's literature in Sri Lanka is inadequate. Its organization, management and dissemination have to be carried out scientifically within a better library framework. Moreover, the selecting and developing a juvenile literature collection and an allied tradition is a must.
Producing reference materials and sources related to children's education is an area that needs attention. Popular world cartoons and strip comic weeklies could be used for children, if they are adapted suitably to the Sri Lankan context.
Difficulties faced by a writer or a literary creator in juvenile literature should be promptly taken into consideration. Responsible parties must take steps to lay a healthy foundation in this regard. This type of activity is an urgent need to improve educational perspectives.
Establishing an organization to develop children's literature under the sponsorship of the government is urgent. The Sri Lanka Child Protection Authority's mission is to safeguard and protect child rights. It should be the central unit that cooperates with relevant departments and sections in juvenile literature locally and abroad. The service of the Sri Lanka Book Publishers Association has to be applauded in this regard.
The National Youth Council, National Institute of Education, Sri Lanka National Library and Documentation Services Board, mass media, Ministries of Education, Educational Services, Cultural Affairs, Social Services and the entire library system are basic units which could shoulder this activity. Support from global organizations such as UNESCO, UNICEF, UNDP and non-governmental organizations can be immensely useful to realize the purpose.

Rangiri Dambulu temple issues to be resolved in weeks
The issues surrounding the Rangiri Dambulu Cave temple will be resolved in the next few weeks, Archaeological Director General Prof. P B Mandawala said.
He said discussions have taken place between monks of the temple, the Mahanayaka Theras and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam as to how the temple should be operated as a world heritage site and a private monument. The disparities between the monks, the authorities, Archaeological Advisory Board, Central Cultural Fund and the minister have been resolved with the parties reaching consensus how they should go about operations of the temple.
The agreements reached by the parties are verbal, but they will be put into writing soon, Mandawala said.
Asked if the temple is closed for tourists, Prof Mandawala said, the temple is not closed.
Asked if the conservation of the temple is taken care of by the Archaeological Department, he said they were asked to leave the temple premises by the monks following the dissonance that escalated earlier between monks of the temple and the minister after the latter making a request with regard to temples income by ticket selling to tourists.

On a roll
She stood out among her colleagues because of her talent with the pen. Next she made her mark in a less trodden area: roll ball. Senuri Perera is a multi talented young girl who has shown her skills in two areas poles apart. The grade 11 student of Anula Vidyalaya, Nugegoda, has embarked on her wordsmith skills when she was in grade nine.
Writing started off as a past time but soon turned into a passion. My first translation was Barbara Parks Junie B Jones and Some Sneaky Peaky Spying. It is a book for teenagers and rotates around a boy who engages in mischief at school, Senuri explained.
Some of her translations are Mura Ballo Saha Vurkayo, Ronnie Ge Pimma, Hima Minisage Abhirahasa, Kauthakagaraye Maraka Abhirahasa, Kannadiyen Mathu Vu Holmana, Othuthu Soyana Pinchi Kella, Avasana Alukuna, Avaman Vu Kumariya, Kakul Thune Kasiya and Minimaru Sevanalla.
I love reading and once a story captivates my heart I translate it because I think other children too would like to enjoy the story, she said.
She has given her writing a small break as she is preparing her G C E Ordinary Level examinations these days. She hopes to follow the maths stream hoping to become a pilot one day.
Her books have captivating art work to go with the enthralling story. The drawings are done by her sister, Ushiri Perera who is studying at Devi Balika Vidyalaya. Her father, Ajith Perera, is an engineer. Her mother, Kamani Mangalika is a house wife.
Speaking about her other passion: roll ball, Senuri noted that though the sport is new to Sri Lanka, it is a very popular sport in the west.
Both me and my sister engaged in table tennis first. We were studying at Girls High School, Mount Lavinia, then. We got through the scholarship examination and entered our present schools. We had to give table tennis a break because of this. My father came from abroad these days and he brought skates for both of us. We had to use the Bellanvila and Torrington tracks for our practices because Sri Lanka does not have proper skating tracks. We got into the speed skating stages and then got into the roll ball sport, Senuri said adding that you need to be good on your balance to excel in the sport.
They were able to acquire a coach later who trained the girls on roll ball. She and her sister were soon able to make it to the Roll Ball World Cup Team 2017. They joined the 12 member team (six players and six extras) and took part in the fourth Roll Ball World Cup matches which were held in Bangladesh in February.
This was the first time that a girls team from Sri Lanka had taken part in the event. Apart from translating and roll ball Senuri is also a skilled swimmer. She has won places for her house at the school sports meets. Six more of Senuris translations are due to be published soon.

Severe drinking water shortage hits drought affected Apura
There has been a large scale scarcity of drinking water in the Anuradhapura district.
People in the Anuradhapura district, especially those in rural areas, are facing a severe shortage of drinking water due to the prolonged drought. Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake told the Daily News that the distribution of drinking water through bowsers, which was confined to six DS Divisions, have now been extended to 11 DS jurisdictions.
Accordingly, steps have been taken promptly for the distribution of portable water to nearly 15,000 families in Vilachchiya, Nochchiyagama, Thambuttegama, Thalawa, Padaviya, Kahatagasdigiliya, Rambewa, Nachchaduwa, Ipalogama, Galnewa and Thirappane DS divisions. The GA said further that, usually one person gets 5-6 litres of drinking water per day.
It is learnt that arrangements are being made to provide drinking water to every family affected by the water scarcity under the supervision of District Disaster Management Assistant Director Deshapriya Bandara .
In the meantime, considering the supply of drinking water as a matter of emergency, the Government Agent has taken measures to hire a fleet of additional bowsers from the district on payment of an allowance to bowser owners. He made a request from bowser owners to provide their bowsers through the divisional secretaries, treating this as a social service, rather than profit. He further said that already he has requested for 28 bowsers from the Disaster Management Ministry.

Sri Lanka continues to be an important South Asian source market in terms of visitors arrivals for Singapore with Sri Lanka arrivals topping the 100,000 mark in 2016, said G B Srithar at a press briefing held in Colombo recently.
To celebrate and sustain this relationship, Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in partnership with Singapore Airlines also organized a road show in Colombo to promote Singapore as destination wherein over 80 Sri Lankan travel agents and 27 Singaporean stakeholders participated.

SL vs. India: First Test begins tomorrow

India will look to extend their domination in Tests when they take on a jaded Sri Lanka in the first game of a three-match series starting here tomorrow, back to a place where they were humiliated before soaring to world No.1.
Virat Kohli and Co. would be keen to avenge their embarrassing loss at the Galle International Stadium in 2015 when they crashed to an embarrassing loss on day four after being bowled out for 112 while chasing 176.
A lot has changed since then as a young and aggressive Kohli has turned into a mature captain, who has led the side to 12 wins out of 17 Tests against West Indies, New Zealand, England, Bangladesh and Australia in 2016-17 season.
The Indian team will be looking to take that confidence into this three-match series, which heralds the onset of a new season, and more importantly, another overseas cycle.
It also marks the second coming of Ravi Shastri at the helm of affairs. The team has been on-tour for five days now, and collectively they seem to have put the entire saga of Anil Kumble's premature departure as well as the dramatic coach- selection process behind them.
With Shastri back in charge, along with Bharat Arun guiding the bowlers, there is atleast a familiarity about the team's setting. It is perhaps the only positive aspect of this lengthy, at times distasteful, saga.
In that light, Shastri will also be wary about what playing at Galle entails for visiting teams.
It was the 'team director' who had roused his hurting troops before the second Test in Colombo, and it worked just fine as India rallied from 1-0 down to take the series 2-1.
It was the first taste of victory away from home for this young team, as also a welcome change in results after successive losses experienced in South Africa, New Zealand, England and Australia previously.
As such, that series win not only marked the culmination of a learning process but also laid down the path for an impressive record in the next two years.
Combining the 2015-16 and 2016-17 seasons, India have lost only one out of 23 Tests (against Australia at Pune) since that defeat in Galle.
This superlative run has bred certain all-round consistency within the squad, starting from the top of its batting line-up until the very end. So much so that the bench strength is replete with ready-made options.
It is the reason why the team management is not utterly worried even as KL Rahul has been ruled out of the first Test owing to viral fever.
The Karnataka-opener was just returning to the international arena after recuperating from a shoulder injury that kept him out of action since March, when he was laid low again after the two-day practice match in Colombo.
It means skipper Virat Kohli will have to go in with Shikhar Dhawan and Abhinav Mukund as first-choice openers. Before the tour began, the two batsmen were competing for one spot.
Dhawan had been relegated from first-choice to third- choice option after the West Indies series last year and then was dropped for the Australia series.
Mukund played in the Bangalore Test against Australia but scored only 16 runs in two innings, so this is another welcome chance for him to impress again.
Beyond the opening slots, the rest of the batting order -- from Cheteshwar Pujara, Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane -- picks itself. Two years ago, India made the mistake of playing five bowlers here and paid dearly as the shortened line-up was unable to handle Rangana Herath in the fourth innings.
It remains to be seen if Kohli is willing to take a similar gamble again, and if not, Rohit Sharma is expected to return to the Test line-up for the first time since he last played against New Zealand in Indore.
While R Ashwin is set to play his 50th Test, the composition of India's attack will be a matter of debate right until toss time. If Kohli does pick five bowlers, there is no doubt he will go in with an extra spinner in Kuldeep Yadav.
Even so, which two pacers will he opt for In the first half of the home season, Mohammad Shami and Umesh Yadav were the preferred pairing, with Ishant Sharma benched and Bhuvneshwar Kumar made to wait for optimal conditions.
The hosts have been set back with their own set of problems. They are still undergoing a tough transitional phase, with Graham Ford stepping down as coach and Nic Pothas asked to perform interim duties.
In order to boost their support staff, Chaminda Vaas and Hashan Tilakratne have come on-board as bowling and batting consultants, respectively.
Meanwhile, new Test skipper Dinesh Chandimal will be unavailable owing to pneumonia. In his absence, Herath will lead Sri Lanka leaving Angelo Mathews to concentrate on his game.
The left-arm spinner took 11 wickets in the one-off Test against Zimbabwe, and will be an ever-present factor in this series against India as well.
Lanka will also be bolstered by the return of pacer Nuwan Pradeep, who last played Test cricket against South Africa in January.
Dhananjaya de Silva has been called up as Chandimal's replacement, but it is the inclusion of left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara that will excite the hosts.
The 30-year-old is yet to make his Test debut, but he boasts of 558 wickets in 99 First-Class matches, making him an ideal foil for Herath.
Squads:
India: Virat Kohli (c), Shikhar Dhawan, Lokesh Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Rohit Sharma, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Abhinav Mukund.
Sri Lanka: Rangana Herath (c), Upul Tharanga, Dimuth Karunaratne, Kusal Mendis, Angelo Mathews, Asela Gunaratne, Niroshan Dickwella (wk), Dhananjaya de Silva, Danushka Gunathilaka, Dilruwan Perera, Suranga Lakmal, Lahiru Kumara, Vishwa Fernando, Malinda Pushpakumara, Nuwan Pradeep.

Sri Lanka keen to extend Indias Ramayana circuit
Sri Lanka is preparing to be part of the ambitious Ramayana circuit India is planning for tourists. The Indian government is identifying places connected with the Ramayana, while Sri Lanka has already identified 71 locations across the island nation for inclusion in the circuit.
The Ramayana describes how Sita, Ramas wife, was kidnapped by Ravana and taken away to Sri Lanka. Hanuman then launches a grand operation, building a stone bridge across the sea, to rescue her.
Sri Lankan has appointed a committee to identify more places, Tourism Development Minister John Amaratunga told the DH.
He was speaking on the sidelines of the 99th edition of the India International Travel Mart, organised by Sphere Travelmedia and Exhibition, which concluded on Sunday.
Amaratunga said, the government had entered into an agreement with the Indian government to create a full circuit.
We are closely working with various Indian state governments to link all places. The two countries share a 5,000-year-old relationship, he said.
Excavation is on for more places described in the Ramayana. We aim to complete the entire circuit by the end of this year. Just like Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we look at Sri Lanka and all south Indian states as one unique unit, housing the maximum Ramayana spots, he added.
The two governments are also working closely on the Buddhist circuit. Not many know that the Buddha visited Sri Lanka three times.
The spots he visited are not so well known either, said Indian Deputy High Commissioner to Sri Lanka V. Krishnamoorthy. He said, Sita stayed at Sita Vyasa in Sri Lanka and was taken to Ussangoda.
More than 320,000 tourists from south India visited Sri Lanka last year and a similar number of Sri Lankans visited India, he said.

Sri Lanka will always be special for Ashwin
GALLE, Monday: Ravichandran Ashwin, who will play his 50th Test against Sri Lanka this week said Sri Lanka would always be special after he resurrected his career there in 2015.
To come back to a place where I did really well last time in 2015 is like a dream come true, because it was some sort of a momentous occasion for me then because I was on the way back into the Test side, he said.
It brings back a lot of good memories, coming back to the same venue.
I think every Test match a blessing from here on, he added.
The lanky bowling all-rounder has scored 1,903 runs and bagged 275 wickets in 49 Tests since making his debut in 2011 against the West Indies. He has scored four centuries and picked 25 five-wicket hauls.
The 30-year-old Ashwin who will be one of Indias key players in the match starting in Galle on Wednesday, the first of three Tests, hailed Indias rebuilding effort to become the number one Test side.
Ashwin believes life has come full circle for Virat Kohlis India since their last tour of Sri Lanka in 2015.
India lost the Galle Test then but bounced back to beat the hosts 2-1. That spurred them on to regain their number one Test crown a year later.
In 2015 I think we were sandwiched in the middle of a leadership takeover. Virat had just taken over in Australia and we came here having played one Test in Bangladesh, Ashwin said.
We had set ourselves a lot of goals for each other and I would say we have achieved them and come out with flying colours over the last couple of years as a group.
We have produced a lot of good cricketers. Some young cricketers have come in and put their hands up and some others have excelled really. That includes me, (Ravindra) Jadeja, Puji (Cheteshwar Pujara).
Sometimes I feel that even good cricketers lose out in this particular team because of the quality we have in the dressing room, he added.
Ashwin became the fastest bowler to 250 Test wickets in a one-off match against Bangladesh in Hyderabad in February, his 45th Test. AFP

SriLankan now offers highest number of destinations in its history
SriLankan Airlines online destination count reached 41 recently with the addition of Coimbatore, the highest ever in the flag carriers aviation history.
With the recently launched routes to Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam, as well as the seasonal flights to Gaya and Varanasi which will resume in August, SriLankan will soon be operating 126 scheduled flights a week to 14 destinations in India  serving more Indian points than any other international airline.
This regains SriLankan the title of the foreign airline with the largest reach into India  a solid and distinct advantage that will help SriLankans commercial efforts and its quest to become a regional carrier of note.
In addition to opening these new routes, SriLankan has also implemented several other network changes from July 15 in line with its strategy of adapting its route network to align with the current market realities.
These include: new daily non-stop flights to Guangzhou, China (eliminating the previous Bangkok stopover); new five times a week non-stop flights to Hong Kong, China (eliminating the previous Bangkok stopover that had operated for decades); flights to Bangkok, Thailand increased from daily to three times a day, to cater to the demand and to enhance network connectivity; and flights to Delhi, India increased from daily to 11 times a week.
SriLankans destination count is set to increase further from the upcoming winter season, as it launches new daily non-stop flights to Melbourne, Australia. This represents SriLankans re-entry to Australia after a hiatus of 16 years. The airline has already seen very strong forward bookings on this route  which gives confidence that it is the right choice. Further expansion of services on strategically important routes are also planned for the winter season.
Two new A320neo aircraft and the first A321neo aircraft have joined SriLankans fleet during the year, with two more A321neo aircraft due to join before the end of the year.

Supreme Court stays garbage dumping at  Muthurajawela till August 3

The Supreme Court today further extended its Interim Order till August 3, preventing authorities including the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) from dumping garbage in the Muthurajawela Sanctuary.
Three-judge-bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Anil Goonaratne and Justice Nalin Perera made this order pursuant to a fundamental rights petition filed by 35 five residents in the close proximity of the Muthurajawela Sanctuary seeking an Interim Order directing the authorities not to store or dump garbage in the Sanctuary.
Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam appearing for the respondents had informed Court that the CMC was not disposing garbage at the Muthurajawela Sanctuary.
The petitioners cited Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), CMC Municipal Commissioner, Urban Development Authority (UDA), Central Environment Authority (CEA), the Wattala Pradeshiya Sabha and six other parties as respondents.
The petitioners further stated that the petitioners and their families and other residents of the close proximity of Muthurajawela Sanctuary have been severely affected and continue to be affected by this dumping.
The petitioners further stated that the area in question is declared a sanctuary under the Flora and Fauna Protection Act by the gazette dated 31.10.1996 in recognition of its vast bio-diversity.
The petitioners further stated that the Muthurajawela is also a large paddy field and it also consist of water canals, marsh lands and the forest.
As per the register of the Agrarian Development Office of the area shows that the total extent of paddy fields in the Muthurajawela amount to 635 acres and a marsh and mangrove amounts to 7,000 acres, the petitioners added.
The petitioners stated that by the said action of dumping garbage in to the sanctuary without any authority or following property procedures, the authorities who allowed and commit such acts have violated the Laws of the country including Section 33(1) and 34(1) of the Agrarian Development Act No.46 of 2000, Section 7(1) (h) (i), Section 7(1) (c) (ii) of the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance.
The said acts done by the CMC have infringed Fundamental Rights of the petitioners as well as of the members of the general public guaranteed to them by them by Article 12(1) and 14(1) (g) and the Fundamental Right to life which is also constituted and guaranteed by the Constitution of the republic.
The petitioners further sought a declaration on the respondents to take necessary actions and appropriate steps to ensure that no garbage is deposited and dumped in the Muthurajawela Sanctuary.
Senior Counsel Dr. Sunil Coorey appeared for the petitioners.

Thai cops bust $3 million phone scam gang
THAILAND: A gang of 44 people from China and Taiwan have been arrested in Thailand for running an elaborate phone scam that conned $3 million from scores of victims, police said Monday.
Raids on houses in the capital Bangkok and the sleazy resort town of Pattaya snared the well-organised gang, whose targets were mainly based in China.
Police seized homemade sound-proof booths used to call the victims, who were carefully selected for their vulnerability.
There were about 120 victims of this fraud, which was worth about 100 million (baht) ($2.9 million), an officer from immigration told AFP, requesting anonymity.
Nineteen of the suspects are from China and 25 from Taiwan.
Posing as police, bank officials or money laundering inspectors the suspects spun stories of financial irregularities linked to the victims bank accounts.
They told victims their bank accounts had been frozen due to criminal activity such as drug dealing, Immigration Police Chief Natthathorn Prousoontorn told reporters on Sunday.
They then persuaded the victims to transfer money to clear the cooked-up problems, through other officials working with the gang.
Each fraudster played a different role... some pretended to be bank officials... some pretended to be police.
The victims lived alone and had no-one to consult before falling for the scam, Natthathorn added.
With porus borders, cheap living and large communities of ex-pats to hide amongst, Thailand has long been a regional hub for crime gangs.
Recently immigration police have arrested hundreds of foreign criminals in a good guys in, bad guys out policy, as the kingdom looks to shake out crooks based in the country. - AFP

Theron on equal pay, female action stars and Bond
Carlize Theron has a message to audiences: See female-driven movies, and studios will make more.
I always say to studios, Make more female-driven movies,  Theron said. They said, We would if people go and see them. So go see those movies!
Theron gave a wide-ranging talk at Comic-Con on Saturday in promotion of her upcoming film Atomic Blonde in which she addressed the Hollywood pay gap, her own pet peeves about female action star clichs and whether or not shed be open to playing a female James Bond, now that even Doctor Who has been made into a woman.
On the Bond question, posed in a statement by her old co-star Chris Hemsworth, Theron said shes all for it, but is fine leaving that one over to Daniel (Craig) or Idris (Elba).
Ill do Lorraine, she said in reference to her Atomic Blonde character  a ruthless British spy on a mission in Berlin near the end of the Cold War.
I think that this character is someone who can hopefully live and breathe in that same format, Theron added.
Atomic Blonde hits theaters on July 28 and is a project Theron has been developing for years. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly writer Sara Vilkomerson in Comic-Cons Hall H, Theron said that she was waiting around for something very specific and when that role wasnt coming to her, she went out in search for it. She and her production team found an unpublished graphic novel that would become the film.
Theron likes Lorraine because she is a bit of an enigma. One of her quibbles with action films centered on female protagonists is that the characters are always given a backstory or a justification for why they became warriors.
We dont need to lose a child or a husband or have some kind of revenge story to become a warrior, Theron said. (Lorraine) exists. Shes simply her. We dont ever over-explain why she exists or why shes any good at her job.
Going along with the theme of female empowerment, Theron also celebrated director Patty Jenkins success with Wonder Woman. Jenkins directed Theron in her Oscar-winning performance in Monster 17 years ago.
We need to have more women make these movies for sure, Theron said. She hopes that Wonder Womans success and that of Atomic Blonde will help move the needle in getting more female-driven movies made and more movies from female directors.
Theron also addressed the issue of the gender pay gap in Hollywood, saying that she put her foot down with The Huntsman: Winters War, where she demanded to have the same pay as Hemsworth. Universal Pictures executives did not even argue with her, she said.
She acknowledged too that she is in a unique position where she can pick and choose roles and when she works, and that not all actresses have that luxury. With social media, we need to keep this conversation going, Theron said.

Atomic Blonde will begin screening from July 28 at MC Colombo, Empire Arcade, City Cinema Mt Lavinia (4.15pm), Savoy Premier, Liberty lite Excel World and other film theaters islandwide

Tri Forces, Police to curtail the spread of dengue
As Colombo and its suburbs see rising cases of dengue, the Army, Navy, Air Force , Police and Civil Defence Force members stepped up their campaign to help control the spread of this mosquito borne plague. Colombo city has seen a rise in dengue victims, partly owing to the issue of garbage disposal which has become a major issue in itself. It is disheartening to see many citizens not taking any interest to keep their environment clean, and help the nationwide alert to restrain the breeding of mosquitoes. The Public Health Inspectors are under much pressure to control these sites, as they seem to be stretched to the limit.
forces engaging in clean up activities
Since July 1st, the following numbers of troops have been involved in visiting houses and setting up clinics that offer free blood testing to the most vulnerable areas - Army (337), Navy (220), Air Force 230, Police and STF (568) and Civil Defence Force (245). These teams have been active in Kalutara, Gampaha and Colombo. They have been able to visit 38,245 residences (as at 15 July) and business premises. Some of the residents of Colombo had various opinions on this campaign. Many were of the opinion that the local Police and PHIs should implement the existing laws to prosecute those who by their wilful negligence propagated the breeding of mosquitoes. On the other hand, some were mildly disappointed that the Tri- Forces should come to check premises for dengue as they feel that the dignity and decorum of the uniformed men must be used only for national disasters like flood and landslide relief operations, where the military displayed their prowess and courage in helping the civil population. This scenario of deploying them for dengue related programmes has been the topic of debate even in the past. Nevertheless the Tri- Forces have been humble to accept this new mission and move forward to eradicate the plague as someone has to take the lead in prevention.
Director of the Police Environment Unit SSP Chulasiri said, Every police station has an Environment Unit, and our officers have supported the ongoing campaign to eradicate dengue. Clogged drains and waterways need to be cleared. It is time that people shared the responsibility of keeping their homes, gardens and environment in an orderly manner.
The Commander Security Force Head Quarters  West, Major General Sudantha Ranasinghe has been guiding his men in the Western Province, Galle and Matara regions.
He said, We are working closely with the AGA and health officials of these areas, and supporting them in this massive campaign. Parents must take care of their homes and keep their children safe.
At the end of the day it is they who fall victim to the fatal sting of the stealthy dengue mosquito. If the citizens had done their part, the plague would not have reached these alarming levels, which has caused the death of so many children.

Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe is the only minister who had been attentive to the demands of the port employees, aside from former Minister Lalith Athulathmudali, Suhada Port Workers Union Chairman Lal Bangamuwage said.

Bangamuwage added that the minister had taken a decision not to privatise the eastern terminal of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), while the recruiting procedure of the employees to the port authority would be amended, as it was required by the ports employees.
He said, the measures would be taken to reactivate the Piya Puthu Foundation in recruitments to the SLPA.
The Chairman further said, there is a shortage of over 300 trained labourers at SLPA and the minister had been notified about it. The parties who contributed to the sale of the Hambantota Port complain the Government for selling it, while the Government at least acquired 30 percent of the ownership of the Hambantota Port, Bangamuwage added.

## Title: Ummah at war

Ummah at war
The ummah is at war with itself. What other way is there to describe the brutal bloodletting by Muslims of Muslims in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Afghanistan, Turkey, and, of course, Pakistan.
Ummah means, the whole community of Muslims bound together by ties of religion.
To be fair, the ummah has not mattered for a long time to the governments or peoples of Muslim lands. State-to-state relations among Muslim countries have been astonishingly independent of religious identity. They have depended instead upon perceived self-interest, domestic politics and the whims of rulers. Just look at the evidence.
Pakistan was created on a religious premise. But, in the days of the Suez Crisis of 1956, Pakistans position was ambiguous. It refused to side with Gamal Abdel Nasser after he nationalised the Suez Canal and threw out the British. On the other hand, India was active in the Non-Aligned Movement, fully pro-Arab, and loud in support of liberating Palestine. To show gratitude, King Saud bin Abdul Aziz paid a state visit to India and declared that Indian Muslims were being treated well. There was outrage across Pakistan. Newspapers exploded in anger when Jawaharlal Nehru, on his return visit to Riyadh, was greeted by the king and with street banners in Riyadh bearing the slogan rasul-ul-salam (messenger of peace).
It is time to give the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation a decent burial.
Muslim neighbours
Dawns editorial of Dec 1, 1956, bitterly criticised the Arabs and Nassers hatred of Pakistan, and love of Bharat and its Nehru. It went on to suggest that such sensate bias and blind prejudice may well be examined by psychiatrists. In other words, the Arab worlds greatest hero of the moment was denounced as crazy.
Today, Pakistan has disputes with both its Muslim neighbours, Afghanistan and Iran. Iran occasionally lobs artillery shells over to Pakistan, as does Afghanistan. Pakistan has reciprocated with its artillery, while PAF jets brought down an Iranian drone last month. Ironically, Pakistan has excellent relations with one of its neighbours  China, a communist state that has banned the beard and burqa in its only Muslim-dominated province. India has good relations with both Iran and Afghanistan. And, Indias trade with China far exceeds Pakistans trade with China.
It is not just Pakistan. The Muslim monarchies of Saudi Arabia and Qatar, both Wahabi, are practically at war with each other now. Teeny tiny Qatar, say the Saudis, is acting too big for its boots and cannot conduct its own foreign policy. Qatar has dismissed the Saudi-UAE demand to close down Al Jazeera, the Arab worlds only independent news source. In response, all Qataris and their families, as well as 15,000 dancing Qatari camels, have been expelled from Saudi Arabia.
Last year, Saudi Arabias highest civilian award was conferred upon Hindu fundamentalist Narendra Modi by King Salman. The Saudi king left Kashmir and pellet guns unmentioned.
Saudi Arabias war on Yemen shows the emptiness of the ummah notion. Directed against one of the worlds poorest Muslim countries, it has so far has killed 7,600 and wounded 42,000 Muslims. Most casualties have resulted from air strikes of the Saudi-led multi-national coalition. Pakistan has shown little concern. I have yet to see a single TV news report or evening talk show discussing the Yemen war.
Ending Israeli occupation of Palestine was once the ummahs grandest cause that cut through the Shia-Sunni divide. But now, Saudi Arabia is fast nearing rapprochement with Israel. Both countries see Iran as the greater enemy. After the failed Arab Spring, Sisis Egypt and the Gulfs monarchies fear Iran as an insurrectionary power and prefer to work with Israel. Palestine is unmentioned.
Where does this leave the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), whose job is to bring together and represent the ummah Based in Saudi Araba, it has 57 member states and calls itself the collective voice of the Muslim world. The OIC has had nothing to say about wars that have consumed Syria, Iraq, Libya, or Yemen. Nor is it relevant to any other conflict between Muslim States or that within them. It has yet to give a single cent to desperate refugees who, instead, must rely on the West. (Sri Lanka had Requested observer status in 2008)
Pakistan bought into the OIC fantasy early on. But the euphoria of the 1974 Lahore meeting organised by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto has gone with the wind. What is left is the magnificent flag-adorned building on Constitution Avenue in Islamabad that serves as the headquarters of Comstech, the highest scientific body of the OIC, for which Pakistan pays the lions share of its operating expenses.
Wonders of science
Comstech is charged with promoting science within the ummah. This is a futile and misplaced effort because science does not have a religion. Add to this the abysmal quality of science in Muslim countries (with Turkey and Iran only partly excluded). Prime Minister Suhrawardy once famously remarked, zero plus zero plus zero is after all still zero. While he said this of the Arab bloc during the Suez crisis, its still truer about scientific cooperation.
It is time to give the OIC a decent burial and end the fantasy that Comstech can serve as the centre of Muslim science. Among the benefits, Comstechs staff could be put to good use promoting science in Pakistan with the building turned into a public science library or science exploratorium where Pakistani children could be introduced to the wonders of science.
If Muslim States have paid no attention to the ummah, non-state actors have paid even less. They have slaughtered tens of thousands of co-religionists. The Afghan Taliban and the Pakistani Taliban are like two wings of the same bird. One kills Afghan Muslims, the other kills Pakistani Muslims. - Dawn

Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets : A sci-fi mess
There are times when Ive been loyally in Luc Bessons corner  the visual splendor of Subway (1985), The Big Blue (1988) and La Femme Nikita (1990) established him as a master of what the French call Cinma du Look. And 1994s The Professional  with Jean Reno teaching the assassins game to a very young Natalie Portman  went deeper, blending style with a nurturing sense of humanity. Plus, theres a lot to be said in favor of both his sci-fi extravaganza The Fifth Element (1997) and last years next-level ScarJo-evolution whatsit Lucy. But Besson has also screwed up badly through the years: The less said about the Joan of Arc fiasco The Messenger (1999) and the very visibly animated turkey Arthur and the Invisibles (2006), the better.
So what to make, then, of his latest passion project Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets Its as gorgeous as anything the French filmmaker has made and as empty as a Trump tweet. You either go with it or you dont. You can make the effort, but after a punishingly 137 minutes  and Valerian does not get better as it goes along  your enthusiasm is likely to collapse. Still, it must be said that this overstyled fantasy is anything but a cynical cashgrab in the Michael Bay manner. Never once do you think that Bessons heart isnt in it. Thats what makes this such a noble failure rather than fresh evidence of a faltering career.
Sci-fi space oddity
Set in the 28th century, Valerian is based on a series of French graphic novels by Pierre Christin and Jean-Claude Mzires that the director says hes been reading since childhood. Its clear that the 58-year-old filmmaker is trying to capture the childlike wonder he felt when he first encountered this sci-fi space oddity. But charming naivete can also seem, as it does here, a little like arrested development.
And I have to say, the actors dont help. Dane DeHaan stars as Major Valerian, a special-ops agent assigned to maintain order in the universe, or at least in the human territories. Its a big job for this sylph-like manchild and despite numerous feats of derring-do, never once does he seem remotely up to the task. DeHaan can act: Check him out in Chronicle, The Place Beyond the Pines and Kill Your Darlings. But here, hes mostly asked to joke and flirt until stuntmen take over for the dangerous stuff.
But if its hard to root for Valerian, its even harder to muster up interest in his partner, Sergeant Laureline. As played by model Cara Delevingne with a smirk that just wont quit, Laureline is way ballsier than Valerian, who still looks in need of a mothers love. She can pose and preen like an expert in her space gear  and those eyebrows!  but theres no there there. In place of characters we get attitudes. Sorry, that just doesnt cut it.
Space invaders
So with two black holes where our daredevil lovers should be, Besson is left pushing the spectacle, an area that puts him on solid ground. The fillmaker has created a whole new world of creatures that delight the eye as his duo zip around Alpha, the City (all together now) of a Thousand Planets where species from all over the universe gather like a United Nations of space invaders to talk peace.
Still, theres no peace for Valerian and Laureline until they rescue Commander Arn (Clive Owen, looking really, really uncomfortable ), whos been kidnapped by endangered aliens who appear to have flown in from Avatar, and ... sorry, recounting the drag-ass plot is putting me to sleep. Anyway, its merely a platform for guest appearances by famous actors who should know better. Ethan Hawke plays a pimp named Jolly, an excuse for the director to indulge his taste for kinky intergalactic sex games, though he even seem timid about getting his freak on here. (You expect batshit crazy from Besson but you wont get nearly enough of it this time.) The only bright spot here is Rihanna, playing a shapeshifting stripper named Bubble who does a kind of music-video dance-off that brings the film to life for a few startling minutes. Hollywood hasnt done right by #Riri  first Battleship, then Annie and now this  but she has something this movie desperately needs: star quality.
All thats left, really, is dazzling production design and 3D that admittedly serves the movie instead of substituting gimmicky murk for thrills. Is there a message that Besson is eager to get out The man has a tin ear for dialogue, but he also has a vision, and someone has given him a $200 million budget to fulfill it. We do know his plot involves a search for a precious pearl. And for the first 20 minutes or so, Valerian is a jewel-like representation of everything you want a Luc Besson movie to be. Then the pearl goes back in the oyster. And everyone is left wondering, what just happened

## Title: War heroes are not murderers, murderers are not war heroes

War heroes are not murderers, murderers are not war heroes
With the arrest of former Navy Media spokesperson Commodore D.K.P. Dassanayake, the usual media spectacle accompanied by the drumming up of rhetoric seems to have commenced. Many sing praises of the Commodore and relate tales of his bravery while in service and allege that the Government was and continues to be on the hunt for war heroes.
Uniforms don't make heroes
How such connection is made is lost to both, the observant reader and the average citizen. Dassanayake was not arrested for his actions committed during the war against terrorism. He was arrested as a suspect for the kidnapping and disappearance of 11 individuals with the aim of collecting ransom through them. A person does not become a war hero just because he wears a uniform. On the other hand, he is not given the authority or licence to commit any lowly act just because he is a member of the defence establishment. The argument is a simple one; if a person acts in violation of the law, he should be punished. It is clear that those who want to sell the war hero label in Dassanayakas case are only doing that to achieve their own petty political ends. In 2000, the army was losing all its major camps; camps such as Elephant Pass were falling like dominoes into the hands of the terrorists and as the Army lay under siege at Jaffna Fort, it was Major General Janaka Perera who gave the necessary leadership to rescue the soldiers trapped in Jaffna. But during the Rajapaksa regime, he was under severe mental and physical pressure and all those who speak on the rights of war heroes today, did not utter a word in support of Major General Perera then. A similar silence was adopted by these so-called patriots when former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka who led the final fight against the terrorists was continuously persecuted. Society was suppressed to that extent during the Rajapaksa regime.
This is not the first or second time that a member of the Police or Army has been arrested for murders or abductions. On August 6, 1996, Krishanti Kumaraswamy was found raped and murdered; her mother; Rasammas 16-year-old brother; Pranavan and a family friend, Kirubarakaran, were strangled and their bodies cut into pieces, were found buried in an army camp. Five suspects from the Army and Police were convicted for these acts. A senior official of the Army was convicted, along with a few other members, for the disappearances of 30 school students from August to November, 1989. In the incident of October, 2000, in Bindunuwewa and in the rape and murder of 16-year-old Premawathi Manamperi on April 16, 1971, the law was enforced on the members of the security forces who committed the crimes, with no special privileges awarded to any of them. Thus, when you compare this incident to our history, this is not an unusual occurrence.
Commodore Dassanayake
The arrest of Commodore Dassanayake was set in motion when former Navy Commander Admiral Wasantha Karannagoda lodged a complaint with the CID in Colombo on May 28, 2009. His complaint was against his personal security officer, Lieutenant Commander Sampath Munasinghe, who had been tasked with investigating links directly or indirectly with the LTTE. The same complaint was investigated by the Navy Provost Marshal Captain Senaka Hanwella, who, when he conducted on-the-spot investigations at a house used by Sampath Munasinghe, found in room number 8 of that house; NICs, passports, credit cards, mobile phones and other personal items of people who had been kidnapped over a long period of time. Among them was a cheque for Rs. 760,000 from the Bank of Ceylon bank in Mt. Lavinia from the account number 049568, a green promissory note bearing no A 3323 for the sum of Rs. 500,000, a pink promissory note bearing number A 5656 for Rs. 400,000; a Commercial Bank pass book holding account number 8020019831, a Bank of Ceylon passbook holding the account number 7960595 and a HNB passbook holding the account number 002020330398, for a person under the name of Sampath; another HNB passbook for the account number 002093553, a passport bearing the number N1431844 under the name of Stanley Leon, a NIC with the number 601772809V under the name K.A. Anton, a NIC with the number 790683021V under the name of Thiyagaraja Jegan, a NIC with the number 584201179V under the name of N.S. Leon, the NICs of Amalan Leon and Roshan Leon; their passports and the mobile phone of a foreigner called Mike Ogan who was living at Ramanadan Flats, was found in the room. Captain Hanwella took all items found into his custody and handed them over to the CID on May 30 for further investigation. It is to be noted here that by this time, Sampath Munasinghe no longer engaged in official naval duties and had got accustomed to a life undercover.
'Navy Sampath'
Sampath Munasinghe had come to be known increasingly as 'Navy Sampath' and when Admiral Karannagoda was the Commander of the Eastern Naval Forces, he worked as an officer in the Trincomalee Naval Intelligence Unit. He came to be known as a talented officer who had uncovered many important information on the LTTE and its operations in the area. When Admiral Karannagoda took over as Navy Commander, he appointed Sampath as his personal security officer. The relationship between the two were close and Karannagoda often treated Sampath as he would his own child. Sampaths influence in the Navy thus was quite significant and many officers came to him if they wanted their transfers adjusted. It is not clear as to what brought about the breakdown of trust between Karannagoda and Sampath but the rumours over the breakup are many.
In the meantime, Karannagoda came to know many suspicious activities surrounding Munasinghe. Among such complaints was the kidnapping of five students for ransom worth millions. As soon as information on the kidnapping came to light, the Navy Commander had ordered the Navy Intelligence Unit Investigator, Ananda Guruge to conduct an internal investigation into the incidents. The disappearances had been made known to the Commander by Captain Jagath Jayantha Ranasinghe. The youth who were kidnapped were Pradeep Vishwanathan, Thilakeshwaran Ramalingam, Rajiv Naganathan, Mohamed Jilal Jamaldeen and Mohamed Saajith. Ranasinghe had revealed all details through a text message to Commodore Udayakeerthi Vijaya Bandara.
Abductions in play
Having kidnapped the youth, they had called Rajiv Naganathans parents and asked that they pay a sum of Rs. 10 million to release their child, but had later reduced the sum to Rs. 1 million and had informed the parents that the money be paid to Sampath, an officer close to the Navy Commander.
The CID, in their investigations, were also able to uncover that out of the NICs and passports handed over to the Department, four of the individuals were reported to be missing since 2008.
Of those missing since 2008, was Stanley Leon, a resident of No. 47/1 Aarippuwala East, Aarippuwala. He had come to Colombo with his son Amalan Leon and the foreigner Mike Ogan to apply for a visa to the United Kingdom. They were staying at the Ramanadan Flats in Kotahena. On August 25, 2008, Amalan and Stanley were kidnapped by an unidentified armed group. The NICs found at Sampaths official residence was that of Thiyagaraja Jegan from Trincomalee. Jegan, who was working at a jewellery shop in Colombo 13, went missing in 2008.The CID was able to get many useful information regarding the abduction when communicators attached to the Sri Lankan Navy Signal Corps; Aluthgedara Upul Bandara and Lakshman Udaya Kumara, who were working under Sampath Munasinghe, were questioned. Upul Bandara, a resident of Raththota, Matale, had mentioned that in 2008, they were informed by Munasinghe that five suspicious individuals would pass Badowita Road, Dehiwala, around 10 pm and that they needed to be arrested. Lieutenant Commander Hettiarachchi and a group had gone in a van at the time to arrest them. They also brought their 5559 black motor car along with them. The tip-off on the economic situation of Naganathans family was given to Munasinghe by Anwer Ali, alias Haajiyar, who was in the intelligence service at the time. Anwar Ali is a resident of Dehiwala.
Rajiv Naganathan was a student from a Colombo International School and he was abducted a day before he was to leave to the UK for his higher studies. He had shown great interest in cricket as well and his Advance Level report card states that he had received 2As and one B. He was to be a doctor. His parents had also decided to gift him a BMW vehicle for having passed his tests. His birthday parties were held in famous hotels and all these factors came into consideration when he was chosen as a likely candidate to be held for ransom.
On the day before he left, Naganathan had gone out for dinner with his friends to Mount Lavinia near St. Thomas' College and his plan was to get a haircut in a famous salon and then meet Anwar Ali afterwards.
Based on the information that has been uncovered thus far, Rajiv was kidnapped and brought to the Colombo Navy Camp in Chaithiya Road. He was next sent to the Navy Camp situated near the Navy Jetty in Trincomalee; this is considered to be one of the biggest naval camps in the country.
Call for ransoms
The camp was initially under the British and it was officially taken over by the Sri Lankan Navy in 1957. Several artilleries used during World War II can still be seen here. There are tunnels and warehouses in the camp which they used to store bullets and gun powder. Rajiv and the group were taken to the camp were kept inside one of the underground prisons called the Gun Side. They later kidnapped Anwer Ali as well over issues related to ransom.
He was kidnapped when he was returning from Katunayake to Colombo. The CID has found enough evidence to prove that all who were kidnapped were kept in the Trincomalee Navy Camp. Rajiv had also phoned his house from the Navy Camp.A person called Annachchi had called Rajivs father Govindar Swamy, demanding Rs. 10 Million as ransom to release his son. After negotiations, the ransom was reduced to Rs. 5 million. The ransom taker had asked him to come to Naarammala and when Swamy asked whether he could come to Welisara, the ransom taker had said he would let him know after talking to 'big annachchi.' Meanwhile, on January 15, Rajiv had phoned his father. Govinda Swamy wanted to know whether it was truly his son who was talking to him on the phone; therefore, he had asked a few personal questions also from Rajiv and after that, he had confirmed that it was his son. Rajiv had told everything that had been going on. In April, 2009, Swamy had got another call from a person called Heshan and he had said that his son would be released if he pays the ransom. Heshan, meanwhile, had let Rajiv talk to his parents over the phone several times.
Rajiv had informed his father that he had been brought to Trincomalee from Colombo. Having confirmed his suspicions that his son along with others had been kidnapped by the Navy and were in their custody, Govinda Swamy had approached his friend, Minister Felix Perera for his assistance in their release. Minister Perera had verbally as well as through written request contacted the Navy Commander about it but no action was taken. Further evidence of the fact that the kidnapped were in Trincomalee was found in Anwer Alis cousin, Sirajs phone on 23 March 2009.
Sampath has caught me. Please inform DIG Kamaldeen and save me, was the message sent by Ali to his cousins phone. On 26 July 2009, Siraj received a phone call from Ali.
This is the last day they are going to keep me here. Please save me, said Ali to Siraj at the time. That was the last time he contacted him.
It has now become very clear that all of them were kidnapped for ransom and the person named Annachchi had also contacted Thiyagaraja Jegans mother and asked a ransom of Rs. 1 million from her too. In negotiations, thereafter, the amount had been reduced to Rs. 500,000 and she was asked to bring the money to an area in Thambalagamuwa. When she had done so, the person who showed up had tried to run away with the money.
It is very evident that a group connected to the Sri Lanka Navy was behind the abduction. It has been revealed that former Lieutenant Commander Sampath Hettiarchchi, who was engaged in special activities related to Sri Lanka Naval ship Parakrama and former Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagodas personal guard Wasantha Munasighe, had used the officers under him to kidnap them. Around 11 individuals from Colombo, Wattala, Kotahena, Dehiwala and Katunayake areas, have been kidnapped. Having made to held in captivity in secret in Tricomalee Navy Camp, they were made to disappear. The present Commodore Sumith Ranasinghe was the then officer in charge of Sri Lanka Navy Jetty when they were held in captivity.

A welcome move
Almost all other problems pale into insignificance beside the garbage problem that has affected the entire country. One can gauge the magnitude of the problem when considering that more than 700 tons of solid waste has to be removed from Colombo alone per day.
The recent collapse of the garbage mountain at Meethotamulla that resulted in 40 deaths was a wake-up call to everyone, from the authorities to the householders, that the issue has to be taken seriously at least now. The dengue epidemic, though not a direct result of garbage accumulation, has compounded the problem and forced all stakeholders to search for an urgent solution.
Now Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka has been tasked with resolving the garbage and solid waste issue, having launched several successful measures to contain the garbage problem in a previous turn as Environment Minister. He has accepted the challenge, knowing the gravity of the issue.
As Minister Ranawaka stressed, the dumping of garbage in landfills is pass. Instead, we have to look for alternatives that actually make use of garbage. Thinking along those lines, the Government plans to initiate three projects in the Western Province next month to generate electricity using municipal solid waste. This initiative forms the basis of measures to find a permanent solution to the festering garbage crisis in urban areas. Making compost fertiliser is another method and Minister Ranawaka has already announced compost programmes that use 300 tons of garbage per day. Around 100 tons are being recycled. Many other countries already have similar programmes and there is no doubt that they can be replicated here.
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had taken a keen interest in addressing the garbage issue long before Meethotamulla. President Sirisena appointed a three member task force comprising Ministers Champika Ranawaka, Faiszer Musthapha and Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya to pilot the garbage disposal project in the Western Province and specifically Colombo. As Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and Minister Ranawaka stressed both international support and latest technology should be used to address the garbage crisis. The Government has focused on finding permanent solutions to the garbage crisis that remained unresolved by successive governments for decades, they said. There will be a scientifically managed sanitary landfill in Aruwakkalu in the Puttalam district.
The ban on polythene and polystyrene coming into effect from September will also go a long way towards addressing the garbage issue. The best way of addressing this issue is reducing the quantity of garbage in the first place. With close to one million lunch sheets being discarded in Colombo alone every day, one can imagine the extent of the problem. Although many varieties of polythene are now biodegradable, this process still takes many years during which time the polythene fills the landfills. Polythene is clearly not a sustainable solution for our environmental problems. The onus is on our scientists and researchers to develop suitable alternatives to polythene which are just as convenient and cheap. Paper is one alternative that can easily be recycled  the older generations will remember the paper bags and gotu which were in vogue before the advent of polythene. Nelum and Banana leaves are already being used as lunch sheets by many establishments, but there are just not enough of them around for one million lunch packs per day. Hence the importance of looking for alternative materials. Our universities must play a leading role in this effort.
The Government alone cannot resolve this problem 100 percent. Public response and participation are essential. The first thing to bear in mind is the value of the 3Rs  Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. Reducing household and commercial waste is essential. If we cook just the amount of food we can eat, there will be nothing left to throw away. If we reuse a bag for shopping (yes, even a polythene one), it will drastically cut down on the siri siri bags that end up in landfills. Awareness on recycling is almost non-existent  the authorities must launch a campaign on recycling through the print and electronic media that will educate the public on what kind of materials and goods can be recycled. It is also vital to reduce electronic and electrical goods wastage  many of these items are Built for Disassembly and can easily be recycled.
One should try to avoid goods that may harm the environment. PET bottles are a good example. Unlike the glass bottles which have to be returned to buy new ones, PET bottles are single-use items which then have to be discarded. The Government should contemplate bringing in laws that restrict their use, but we can do our bit by minimizing PET purchases.
Education is a vital part of the chain. Children should be encouraged from very young days to separate garbage according to type and not to waste food indiscriminately so that the next generation will be much more knowledgeable and responsible on garbage. Technology will also have marched on by then, finding solutions to todays vexed problems. Until then, everyone must chip in to waste less.

WIM, IFCs Top 50 womens awards seek to promote gender equality
Promoting gender equality among the women closest to you; your wife, your sister, your daughter, can lead to significant change in the landscape of a country. Sri Lanka especially needs this change, as the constraints restricting womens participation in the labor force are behavioral and social in nature, according to Dr. Idah Z. Pswarayi-Riddihough, World Bank Country Director for Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
Dr. Pswarayi-Riddihough was speaking at the recent Top 50 Professional and Career Women Awards 2017, where women business leaders, both corporate and small and medium entrepreneurs, as well as women in the public sector and civil society, were recognized for their achievements. The event was held at the Taj Samudra.
The awards were presented by Women In Management (WIM), in partnership with IFC, a member of the World Bank Group.
This award is not just a personal achievement, its for the nation, for our future generations. I have been traveling for the last few years to many neighbouring countries as a guest speaker for Women in Business and I regret to say that only Sri Lankan women are uncomfortable receiving awards. Everywhere else, women are so competitive. They believe in themselves, and that they deserve to be recognized. They believe they can be the nations mentors. Sri Lankas women leaders too should endeavor to win awards, to motivate and mentor the next generation following them, said Dr. Sulochana Segera, Founder of Women in Management.

Witness reveals crucial evidence
Following an order made by the Treasury Bond Commission, former PTL CEO Arjun Aloysius handed over all his communication devices including his mobile phone and the laptop to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID)investigators at the Commission premises yesterday evening.
The order included Aloysius to surrender all personal communication devices used by him in the years 2015 to 2016 to the CID team which is attached to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue.
Aloysiuss lawyer said to the Commission that one of Aloysiuss Apple mobile phones was destroyed in Singapore.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda said that the Commission would like to know in detail how this destruction took place.
Kodagoda alleged that the so called destruction may have been an attempt to suppress materials relevant to the matter probed into.
The Bond Commission testimony yesterday revealed that Arjun Aloysius, the former CEO of Perpetual Treasuries had paid a lease amount of close to 8.7 million on behalf of the family of the then finance minister Ravi Karunanayake, for a fifth-floor super luxury condominium apartment at the Monarch residencies.
Giving evidence, the former owner of the apartment, a witness identified as Muthukudaarachchige Vinodini said that she met both Arjun Aloysius and the wife of Minister Karunanayake, Mela, at the Penthouse apartment 5PH2 in January 2016.
Mela Karunanayake came to the penthouse accompanied by two body guards. We spoke casually with each other and I remember Mrs. Karunanayake saying it was difficult for politicians to find houses for rent. Then Mela took a telephone call, Vinodini said.
DSG Yasantha Kodagoda, who was leading evidence, asked if the telephone conversation was heard by the witness.
No, I was not in the vicinity when Mela took the telephone call. Following this conversation, Mela told me that a person known by both me and her will come to the Penthouse. the witness said.
Vinodini said the person who arrived at the apartment was PTL former CEO Arjun Aloysius.
He was surprised and clearly not expecting to see me. We greeted each other and Aloysius asked me if the apartment will be rented with or without the furniture. Vinodini earlier said that she knew Aloysius, first through her schooling at the Colombo International School and thereafter as a friend of a person she had a relationship with.
After inspecting the house, Aloysius told me that he will rent out my apartment, Vinodini said. She added that it was clear that the Karunanayake Family would be the residents.
Justice Jayawardena asked if Mela Karunanayake and Arjun Aloysius inspected the house together. The witness did not recall the specifics.
When Aloysius told me that he would rent out the apartment, I found the arrangement to be a bit awkward, so I said I will think about it. Vinodini said. The witness said she later came to a verbal agreement with Aloysious to rent out the apartment.
The DSG then asked the witness if it was clear to her that the house was to be rented on behalf of the Karunanayakes, and Vinodini replied in the affirmative.
But I particularly told Arjun that I will rent the penthouse to him and I did not want more than one party involved in the transaction. She said.
Explaining how the agreement was signed, Vinodini said she initially refused to enter into a lease with the company proposed by Aloysius lawyers because the company through which he was trying to lease the apartment did not have Aloysiuss name in the board of directors or shareholders.
She said that then, Aloysius reverted with another company, namely Walt & Rowe Associates, a direct subsidiary of his holding company Perpetual Capital Holding Limited.
The Director board of the company comprised Arjun Aloysius, his father Geoff Aloysious and another individual. She said Aloysius paid Rs. 7.3 million for the lease and an additional payment of Rs. 1.4 million in cash for the transaction.
Pointing out the method of transactions, DSG Kodagoda asked the witness to identify how the transactions took place.
Accordingly, marking documents, it was revealed that Perpetual Holding Limited had deposited a cheque to Walter & Rowe and the same amount was paid by Walter and Rowe in a cash cheque to the witness on February 8, 2016.
The witness the elaborated that following articles on certain websites on Aloysius renting out a penthouse on behalf of Former Finance Ministers family, Arjun Aloysius gave her a telephone call.
He called me and requested to destroy the lease agreement we signed for the penthouse. Aloysius told me that he got rid of the lease agreement in his possession. Winodini said.
She also said such a request coming from Aloysius was confusing and I decided not to destroy the document. She submitted the original copy of the lease agreement of the penthouse to the Commission.
Justice P.S.Jayawardena while going through the document observed that the lease agreement quite correctly has been registered under the land registration department and said destroying the original lease agreement is purposeless. The witness said such a decision indeed was a senseless thing to do.
The witness thereafter said the Karunanayake family bought the penthouse a few months after the six-month lease was over, in late 2016, for Rs.165 million though a company named Global Transportation and Logistics Pvt Limited. Minister Karunanayakes wife and daughter are Directors of the company.
Kodagoda asked Vinodini when two CID officers approached her on 22 March 2017, if she assumed that the officers knew about the transactions which had elaborated on. The witness said she understood that the CID was already aware of the complete transaction.
Kodagoda asked if anybody who is directly involved in the transaction she testified on contacted her or her family members. Vinodini responded that Minister Ravi Karunanayake had been in contact with her father recently, however she was not aware of the reason for these contacts. She had earlier stated that Minister Karunanayake and her father had maintained a close association over several years.
The witness who testified before the Commission was represented by lawyer Suren de Silva who requested that the Commission not divulge the identifying information of the witness or her family members or permit the media to do so.
The Commissioner Justice P.S. Jayawardena said the Commission cannot order media on their reporting but requested that media ethics should be observed when reporting the proceeding taking this request into account.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda pointed out that the witness has expressed a fear of a life threat after providing statements to the CID and the Commission, and noted that it was thus appropriate for the commission to take appropriate protective measures.

World Cup heroine Shrubsole lives out Lords dream
London: Anya Shrubsole said her match-winning display in Englands Womens World Cup final win over India at Lords on Sunday was proof that dreams can come true.
The 25-year-old pace bowler turned the match on its head with a spell of five wickets for 11 runs late on as England snatched a nine-run win.
India were on course for victory at 191 for three, chasing 229.
But they were dismissed for 219 to deny captain Mithali Raj a winners medal in what the star batsman said was her last World Cup match. Just days before the final Ian Shrubsole, Anyas father, tweeted a picture of his then nine-year-old daughter watching him play in a club final at Lords, with the caption: What a place! Id like to play here... for England... in a World Cup final.
Following her stunning display in front of a sold-out Lords, Shrubsole, whose return of six for 46 was the best by any bowler in a Womens World Cup final, joked: Dads Twitter profile has gone through the roof!
If someone had said to me that all this time later Id be at Lords, winning a World Cup final, I would have laughed them away - you never think that sort of thing happens.
Recalling that childhood visit to Lords, Shrubsole told BBC Radio Five Live: I remember the day, I remember watching him in that game -- I dont remember saying that but I guess it just shows that dreams can come true.
This World Cup altered many entrenched perceptions regarding womens cricket, with Kapil Dev, captain of the India side that won the 1983 mens World Cup final at Lords, telling the Hindu newspaper: Mithalis team too has won the hearts of the nation.
I know that not every daughter will become a champion, but I am sure that the mindset of parents is bound to change now.
He added: Honestly, I was not a keen follower of womens cricket, but I am their biggest fan now. I am sure... people will pray to be blessed with daughters. Hats off to them.
Shrubsole agreed this World Cup had marked a turning point for the womens game, with the final drawing a global television audience of 100 million according to some estimates.
I think its a watershed moment for womens cricket, said Shrubsole.
The final was a really fitting tribute to the whole tournament, which has been brilliant from start to finish.
We obviously set out to win, but we also want to inspire women and girls to play cricket and hopefully our win, and the way we have played, has done that.
As for the thrilling conclusion to the final, Shrubsole -- also involved in a run-out -- said: Once we got Raut it just gave us a little bit of hope, a little chance with the new batters coming in under a huge amount of pressure.
There threatened to be a late twist when, with India nine wickets down but still in sight of victory, Jenny Gunn dropped an easy catch to reprieve No 11 Rajeshwari Gayakwad.
But Shrubsole -- who struck a first-ball four to seal a two-wicket semi-final win over South Africa after England almost snatched defeat from the jaws of victory -- bowled Gayakwad next ball.
In the end, Englands total in the final of 228 for seven, featuring Natalie Scivers 51 and valuable late-order runs had proved just enough.
Its still pretty surreal to be honest, said Shrubsole.
Youve always got to believe you can win no matter what the score and no matter what the game situation.
We fought until the end and it came off. AFP
