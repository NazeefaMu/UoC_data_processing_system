Merchandise exports up by 3.7% to US$ 1.04 bn in August
The external sector performance remained subdued in August 2018. During the month the deficit in the trade account narrowed marginally compared to a year earlier as the rise in export income outpaced the growth in import expenditure.
Meanwhile, other inflows to the current account continued to be modest in August 2018 with a marginal increase in earnings from tourism and a decline in workers remittances.
On a net basis, the financial account of the Balance of Payments (BOP) recorded outflows during the month, due to withdrawals of foreign investments from both the government securities market and the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and continued debt service payments. These developments, alongside the broad based strengthening of the US dollar, continued to exert pressure on the exchange rate to depreciate, thus necessitating intervention by the Central Bank in the domestic foreign exchange market to curtail undue excessive volatility in the exchange rate. As at end August 2018, gross official reserves amounted to US dollars 8.6 billion.
In August 2018, export earnings increased at a faster pace than the growth in import expenditure narrowing the deficit in the trade account marginally, on a year-on-year basis.
Nevertheless, on a cumulative basis, the trade deficit expanded during the first eight months of 2018 in comparison to the corresponding period of 2017. Surpassing US dollars 1 billion for the third consecutive month, Earnings from merchandise exports increased by 3.7 percent
(year-on-year) to US dollars 1,037 million in August 2018.
This growth was mainly driven by higher performance in industrial exports while agricultural and mineral exports declined. Under industrial exports, earnings from textiles and garments increased
in August 2018 reflecting increased demand from the USA and non-traditional markets such as India, Japan, Australia and Canada despite a decline in exports to the EU market. Further, export earnings from rubber products rose during the month due to the better performance in all sub categories, particularly rubber tyres.
Earnings from petroleum products increased substantially in August 2018 due to higher export prices of bunker and aviation fuel in line with rising fuel prices in the international market, although a reduction was recorded in export volumes.
Export earnings from food, beverages and tobacco also increased during the month due to the good performance in manufactured tobacco and vegetable, fruit and nuts preparations, particularly in coconut related products.

More body parts found from Indonesian jet
INDONESIA: Indonesian search teams Tuesday recovered more remains at the site of a crashed Lion Air jet that plunged into the sea with 189 people aboard, as a report said it had suffered an instrument malfunction the day before.
The Boeing-737 MAX, which went into service just months ago, crashed into the Java Sea moments after it had asked to return to Jakarta on Monday.
Flight JT 610 sped up as it suddenly lost altitude and then vanished from radar 12 minutes after take-off, with authorities saying witnesses saw the jet plunge into the water.
The accident has resurrected concerns about the patchy safety record of Indonesias aviation industry.
Search teams have filled ten body bags with limbs and other human remains, Muhammad Syaugi, chief of the Indonesian national search and rescue agency told Metro TV. Dozens of divers are taking part in the recovery effort.
The parts were taken for identification and DNA testing at a Jakarta police hospital, where distraught relatives gathered, including Hari Setiyono whose son-in-law was on the doomed plane.
My daughter has no husband, my grandchild no longer has a father, Setiyono told AFP.
The remains of a baby were among those found, according to national deputy police chief Ari Dono Sukmanto.
Another 14 bags filled with debris have also been collected, including shoes, items of clothing and a wallet.
Everything on the surface of the water has been collected, Syaugi said.
Indonesias National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) said there were 178 adult passengers, one child, two infants, two pilots and six cabin crew on board flight JT 610.
Among them were the planes Indian captain, 20 Indonesian finance ministry employees and Andrea Manfredi, an Italian former professional cyclist.
The search and rescue agency all but ruled out finding any survivors late Monday, citing the discovery of body parts that suggested a high-impact crash in water some 30-40 metres deep off the coast of Indonesias Java island.
We are prioritising finding the main wreckage of the plane using five war ships equipped with sonar to detect metal underwater, said Yusuf Latif, spokesman of the Indonesian search and rescue agency.
Both the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder -- which could be key pieces of evidence -- are still missing.
The plane had been en route to Pangkal Pinang city, a jumping off point for beach-and-sun seeking tourists on nearby Belitung island, when it dropped out of contact around 6:30 am (2330 GMT).
Lion Air said the plane had only gone into service in August. - AFP

No foreign mission said decision was wrong
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said that most foreign embassies had based their statements on the present situation by referring to the English text of the Constitution which is grossly misinterpreted.
He noted that most statements had hoped that the incidents unfolding in the country were legal and constitutional. No one said we did something wrong, he said.
The Minister also said that they have requested the foreign missions which issued travel advisories to revoke it considering the current situation. In 2001 when a government was sworn it, nearly 61 individuals were injured in various incidents related to the transition of the new government, said Minister Samarasinghe. In this instance only one person was killed and two others were injured. We ask these missions to reconsider the situation and revoke their travel advisories.
The Speaker over the weekend called for a meeting with the party leaders on the current political climate.
He had reportedly referred to the meeting as being informal and an opportunity for party leaders to explain their rationale behind the new appointment. The meeting lasted no more than 15 minutes during which we thanked the Speaker for giving us the opportunity to speak. We showed him that the President has the right to convene or prorogue Parliament on his own accord, which the Speaker accepted.
The Speaker had cited that a document containing the signatures of 126 MPs calling to convene Parliament had been received by his office. He said that he has written to the President and has requested his opinion on the matter.
The Parliament was not supposed to sit until November 5 anyway, said Minister Samarasinghe. The President has merely prorogued it for eight days, which is not very long. When Parliament meets on 16th, it will be a mere ceremonial sitting and not an opportunity for anyone to contest legality of this appointment.
According to Minister Samarasinghe, the Speaker spent the rest of the meeting allotting time for the other party leaders to meet with him personally. We showed him that we acted in accordance with the law which was followed up by the issuance of the two gazette notifications making both actions, the revocation of the Prime Ministers post and the appointment of a new Prime Minister legally binding.

Once upon a time  tales told twice
I have two books lying on my table. One is a compilation of eight folktales titled as Eight folktales from eight countries (Rataval Ataka Janakatha Atak) as adapted by the well-known writer Piyasena Wickramage. The other is a translation of a science fiction written by Bhadraji Mahinda Jayatilaka in English titled as Purple Planet that has won an award for the best childrens book translated into Sinhala Amritha Wickramage titled as Dura Eta Dam Polowa. Both books attempt to capture a subject filled with reality transformed into fantasy.
I say thus the former work that is basically is folk, orally transmitted through the ages down by the humans who wanted to raise questions on why what and how things exist, as they are.
As Malinowski once stated all folktales remain to be the legacy of the folk knowledge orally transmitted transcending the cultural barriers. In turn when science fiction came to be written down by such writers as Jules Verne and HG Wells they too were influenced by this legacy. Today the time has come to realize that both genres, folk and sci-fi are fantasies, which in turn answer some of the same questions like, what, why and how things happen.
Resourceful mission
I am not going to address these issues at length. Instead, the primary attempt in the folk compilation happens to be the depiction of similarities in the resourceful mission of the folktale narrates drawn from eight nations. They include New Zealand, Greece, North America, Mexico, Nigeria, Ireland and Japan. The compiler Wickramage as the epilogue to the compilation states has been spending a certain period in New Zealand in a library utilizes a library from his benefit in the process of obtaining folk material for a wider field of studies. In a relaxed manner, the compiler cum adaptor of these folk narratives attempts to provide new meanings to certain age-old adages linked to folk narratives.
One such concept is the rationale behind the term once upon a time. The term is common to all the nations not only as a catchphrase but also as an oral transmission form, despite the categories such as parables, fairy tales and religious narratives. Henceforth the references to unseen forces such as gods and goddesses are regarded as invisible and undiscovered cosmic forces that transcend the mere findings.
References too are made to similar studies of the pantheon of gods upwards and downwards with special reference to the god of gods Zeus. The qualities such as over=pervading compassions in the hearts of humans are treated as the most powerful spiritual force unfathomable.
As most folktale researchers like James Fraser has underlined, it is quite difficult to perceive how the great folk narratives came to be created. It is still a mysterious factor that lay embedded in the realm of the human research process. The life-giving forces to humans via rivers, seas, mountains and the process of rituals linked to them too are sensitively captured in these narratives.
Magical issues
Even though the term magic realism is used today by the post-modernistic critic today, the term has its roots in folklore. As some folk narrative revolve around, magical issues such as bringing back to those who are dead and passed away, the narrative form itself may visualize the roots in folklore common to the orient and occident. It is actually the mask and the face, identified as false and real.
The healing processes of great folk medical doctors as seen in the folk narratives though branded witchcraft may be rediscovered in the most modern rediscoveries in the medical field today. One good example is the therapy or chiktisa as it is known by the medical healers. A modern reader of folk narrative, I feel may get a chance to rediscover some of these literary nuances via the compilation. Then coming on to the childrens book, Dura Atha Dam Polowa as translated by Amritha Wickramage, the reader may have the chance of entering into the more modern standpoint on the scientific stance as regards the advent of a child into an alien planet where he discovers his own living conditions in a different manner. The fascinating science fiction revolves around the imaginative journey of a child these realms of aliens enable him to gather not only mere information but also about flying saucers and the various discoveries made on the same.
Amritha is cited as a scientist settled in New Zealand. This is her third transaction. To her credit, she has written seven books so far. The two works have to be regarded as gifts of a father and a daughter providing knowledge o with the masses.
The narrative technique mostly used in the process of communication is observed as a dialogue that embraces a spoken dialect. Perhaps the fascinating fantasy deserves this flavour over and above the classical flavour. Both books are well illustrated in order to add colour to the narratives. The eight folk narratives as selected from eight cultures and the science fiction from our culture created as make-believe could tend to give way for a comparative interpretation as a classroom exercise in creative communication patterns. I feel that as classroom creative exercises both in literature and communication are waning off from teaching, these works could enable a healthy stimulation for the teacher as well as the student.

Open-air museum along Australian coastline
For the 22nd year, Sydneys Bondi Beach has been invaded by incredible pieces of sculpture. This year, Sculpture by the Sea welcomes over 130 artists from 21 countries who have created an open-air exhibition through their contemporary sculpture. The event, which was started by volunteers in 1997, draws large crowds over the course of its three-week run.
For the 2018 edition, numerous international artists joined 70 Australian sculptors participating in the event which runs from October 18 to November 4. Of particular note is a strong contingent of Chinese artists. Eight artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing (CAFA) are participating thanks to the involvement of Lv Pinchang, CAFAs Dean of Sculpture.
Other sculptures move away from realism, such as the work by Italian-Australian artist Alessandra Rossi. Her multi-component work Cairn is part of a new series that recalls the man-made stone piles that have been constructed by many cultures since pre-historic times.
In this new series of work the abstraction and simplification of form contains the light and colors of the landscape in which it is placed, exposing the hidden and the imaginary, in a balancing act between fragility and impermanence, writes the artist in a statement.
Until November 4, the public is invited to immerse themselves in more than one mile (2 km) of coastline dotted with art. There are also free artist talks, tours, an indoor sculpture exhibition, and a sculpture conference at the Sydney Opera House to round out the program. Toward the end of the event, one sculptor will receive the Aqualand Sculpture Award, winning a cash prize of $70,000 AUD and seeing their sculpture gifted to the Harbour Trust for permanent display at George Head in Headland Park.

People celebrating political transformation  - Ven. Galaboda Gnanissara Nayake Thera
The public is celebrating the political transformation which took place in the country with pride and joy, Hunupitiya Gangaramadhipathi Ven. Galaboda Gnanissara Nayake Thera said.
He made this observation delivering an anusasana when the new Education and Higher Education Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe called on him at his temple and received the blessings of the Maha Sangha before assuming duties at his new Ministry yesterday.
Ven Gnanissara Thera said the fact that there was no upheaval among the people regarding this transformation proved that they happily accepted it.
Ven Gnanissara Thera said a majority of people elected a President by casting their votes in his favour. A government in partnership with the UNP existed for nearly three-and-a-half years.
There was no uproar among the people who elected a government with UNP partnership against the recent political transformation.
No one among the public criticised or wept when President Sirisena took this decision.
His observation was that the people had been burdened with a multitude of problems and lived in fear during the last three-and-a-half years.
People who ruled the country during the last three-and-a-half years should rethink whether they had looked into the problems and difficulties people encountered and resolved them.
Education and Higher Education Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said they removed Prime Minister D. M. Jayaratne who had 162 votes in Parliament and appointed Ranil Wickremesinghe who had only 41 votes even without officially intimating D. M. Jayaratne of his removal. That letter is still lying in the Presidents files. A lot of things harmful to the country had happened during the last three-and-a-half years. The responsibility of correcting that wrong had now devolved on them.
The programme of work undertaken by the former government had been harmful to the country. They could not allow the continuation of that programme according to their conscience.

At half year the Companys domestic sale was lower by 3% at Rs. 2,136 million as against Rs. 2,184 million of the previous year, whilst the export sales stood at Rs. 1,390 million as against Rs. 898 million of the previous year, reflecting a growth of 55%.
Sales during the second quarter of FY2018-19 was Rs. 1,878 million, which reflects a growth of 12% when compared to the corresponding period of the previous years figure Rs. 1,679 million.
The domestic sale stood almost at par with that of the previous years similar quarter at Rs. 1,121 million as against Rs. 1,100 million.
The Management of PGC made special efforts to expand their sales in the export market in a bid to offset the domestic setback. Thus the high growth seen in the export market is the outcome of the initiatives proactively converted to sales in the newer markets. PGC has demonstrated its capability by achieving export sales for the quarter of Rs. 757 million as against the Rs. 579 million received in the similar quarter of the previous year which depicts a growth of 31%. The export volumes to Canada, USA, Vietnam and India took the lead among the increased export sales.
Whilst during the quarter the company ensured a top-line growth of 12%, gross profit margins fell from 21% to 10% with the quarter ending at a loss of Rs.8.5 million as against the profit of Rs. 49 Million in the previous year similar Quarter.
The gross profit during the period under review was severely impacted by the fuel increase which in turn has directly impacted the prices of raw materials, packing material and transportation costs.
The margins further declined due to the increase in LPG costs by 35% and furnace oil increase by 15%. The published results are only partly impacted by this, with the full impact being yet to be felt in the future quarters. In this situation, the Company has been compelled to pass on part of the inflation to the second half of the current financial year.
The change in consumer demand trends have also impacted the gross profit. Due to the increase in levies and taxes, the final products are becoming more expensive. This has resulted in the consumer shifting towards smaller pack sizes.
With this in mind the company is in the process of investing in a new bottle production line which would enable the additional downstream equipment capacity to increase the production quantity of smaller bottles.

PMs appointment in accordance  with Constitution - Ali Sabry, PC
President Counsel Ali Sabry in his opinion on the reading of the Constitution has pointed out that the Presidents appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister was done in accordance with the Constitution.
There is a Constitutional law discussion which has arisen after the President decided to swear in former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister of the country.
Former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe continues to claim that he is the Prime Minister. It is interesting to study the Constitutional Provisions governing the appointment and/or seizure of the post of Prime Minister in terms of the law. In other words the Supreme Law of the land, he noted in a statement to the media.
Sabry highlighting Article 42 (1) of the Constitution as, 42. (1) There shall be a Cabinet of Ministers charged with the direction and control of the Government of the Republic.
Thus formation of the government begins with the formation of the cabinet. In that scenario the President who is the head of the Cabinet of ministers [Article 42(3)] can appoint a member of Parliament who in the Presidents opinion is most likely to command the confidence of the Parliament
Further he points out Article 42 (4) which states, The President shall appoint as Prime Minister the Member of Parliament, who, in the Presidents opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament.
The President in terms of Article 43(3) of the Constitution is entitled at any time to change the composition subject and functions of the Ministers.
Once the President and the Prime Minister decides to form the cabinet. Such Cabinet shall be restricted to numbers specified in Article 46 (1)(a) Article 46(1)(b) of the Constitution which restricts the number of cabinet members to 30 and deputy and state ministers to 40.
The outgoing cabinet was beyond the aforesaid numbers. Thus it was only possible to form such a large Cabinet in the event of a National Government.
A National Government is specified in Article 46 (5) of the Constitution which reads as follows;
For the purpose of paragraph (4), National Government means, a Government formed by the recognised political party or the independent group which obtains the highest number of seats in Parliament together with the other recognized political parties or the independent groups
Accordingly and admittedly the National Government which was formed ceased to exist as one of the constituent parties thereof namely United Peoples Freedom Alliance [UPFA] had withdrawn from the said Government. In other words, the Government of the day upon the withdrawal of UPFA ceased to exist. Thus, the necessity to form a new government had
Constitutionally arisen.
Next logical question is when the National Government ceases to exist what happens to the Cabinet and the Prime Minister
When the government had fallen there cannot be a cabinet. The Cabinet ipso facto dissolves.
It is important to look at the provisions in Article 46 (2) of the Constitution which talks about the Prime Ministers post and his tenure in office.
Article 46 (2) reads as follows;
The Prime Minister shall continue to hold office throughout the period during which the Cabinet of Ministers continues to function under the provisions of the Constitution unless he 
(a) resigns his office by a writing under his hand addressed to the President; or
(b) ceases to be a Member of Parliament.
Accordingly, with the withdrawal of UPFA the then existing unity government and the Cabinet of Ministers cease to exist so does the Prime Minister. Hence, the post of Prime Minister had fallen vacant. Thus its a new beginning which begins with the formation of the new Government.
First of such test is for the President to invoke Article 42(4) of the Constitution.
command the confidence of Parliament.
Accordingly, the President appointing a Member of Parliament who in the Presidents opinion is likely to command the confidence parliament is perfectly constitutional.
At this point in time which is an interim period until such time the Parliament is convened and the Prime Minister is to prove his majority what matters is the Presidents opinion. President Maithripala Sirisena in his opinion had appointed Hon. Mahinda Rajapakse as the Prime Minister of the Republic.
It goes without saying whoever who is appointed as the Prime Minister, shall show his majority in the Parliament to continue to function in the said position.

PMs appointment  constitutional - Govt
The incumbent government led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa denied allegations that appointing the former President as Prime Minister was unconstitutional and unlawful.
Government spokesmen said the disparity on the interpretation of the constitution has led to misgiving.
Addressing the first cabinet briefing, United Peoples Freedom Alliance spokespersons, Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe and MP Keheliya Rambukwella rejected claims that the country has been cast into anarchy adding that the conferment of a prime minister position was done in accordance with the constitution.
There is a disparity in the English translation of Clause 48 (1) of the constitution which has led many to believe the appointment of the Prime Minister is unconstitutional, said Minister Samarasinghe reading out the English and Sinhala texts. Former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe seems to have forgotten to refer to the Sinhala text. According to the Sinhala one, appointment of former President Rajapaksa is in keeping with the law and in a court of law the Sinhala text prevails.
Minister Samarasinghe said that on Friday (27), General Secretary of the UPFA had written to the Speaker of their intention to exit the coalition government.
When the party with the majority leaves the coalition, cabinet is dissolved by default. The position of the PrimeMinister who is part of the cabinet becomes redundant and falls vacant.
MP Keheliya Rambukwella said that the President has exercised his rights in accordance with the law which was followed by two gazette notifications making it legally binding.
Who is causing the most unrest and instability If the UNP wishes to seek redress they should do so either through Supreme Court or Parliament without bringing people on to the streets. Minister Samarasinghe said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had emailed Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera on Saturday seeking a clarification to which the latter had replied quoting two gazette notifications and Clause 48 (1) of the constitution.

The eagerly awaited and the much hyped UNP protest rally which promised to show over 50,000 faces ended with only10,000 of its numbers turning out.
One of the protesters who came from Matara said that they attended the rally not to show solidarity to former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe but to look for a new leader. Ranil Wickremesinghe has once again showed that he is a failed leader and we do not want history to repeat itself again, he said.He said the UNP was in the Opposition for a long period and once again they have been pushed into this position due to the weak leadership of Ranil Wickremesinghe. We want a new leader like Sajith Premadasa to carry this party forward, they said.
Another supporter from Colombo who attended this rally said they want Sajith Premadasa to lead them and they attended this rally to give this message. Ranil Wickremesinghe at the last Party Convention said he would lead the UNP until 2030. However if he remains for at least one year there wont be a UNP for him to lead as it would be divided in to several fragments.

Ranil no longer PM - Chirantha Amarasinghe
Civil activist Chirantha Amarasinghe in a statement yesterday said the moment the unity government was dissolved with the withdrawal of the majority party, the Cabinet of Ministers in which MP Ranil Wickremesinghe holds position as Prime Minister would no longer function under the provisions of the Constitution.
Excerpts from the statement:
In the context of recent media reports and statements made by former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in relation to the appointment of the new Prime Minister MP Mahinda Rajapaksa, many unbiased non-political legal experts I consulted referred to paragraph 46(2) of the Sri Lanka Constitution (including the 19th Amendment) which states, The Prime Minister shall continue to hold office throughout the period during which the Cabinet of Ministers continues to function under the provisions of the Constitution unless he .
Thus the moment the unity government dissolved with the withdrawal of the majority party, the Cabinet of Ministers in which MP Ranil Wickremesinghe holds position as Prime Minister would no longer function under the provisions of the Constitution.
Therefore, MP Ranil Wickremesinghe would no longer be Prime Minister.
Article 42 (4) of the Sri Lankan Constitution states, The President shall appoint as Prime Minister the Member of Parliament who in the Presidents opinion is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament.
The use of most likely means it does not have to be certain. As the Sri Lankan President is the Executive, the appointment is made in the Presidents opinion.
I wish to remind you that when MP Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed as the Prime Minister in January of 2015, he did not have a majority in Parliament.
In defence, it is being pointed out by MP Ranil Wickremesinghes side that the unity government Cabinet formed under Articles 46(4) and 46(5) of the Sri Lanka Constitution was an expansion of his existing Cabinet, and therefore, the withdrawal of the party would default it to the original.
To my understanding it is a statement which has no grounds in the Constitution.
I condemn the Constitutional Council formed by the so called good governance government and call it a complete fraud. It is aimed at depoliticising (meaning remove from political activity or influence) the public service and is tasked with maintaining independent commissions.
Seven out of ten of its members are politicians which is an utter joke which other countries and the United Nations have not uttered a word about for the past three years. I take this opportunity to condemn the United Nations for keeping silent with regard to the said matter.

Rerun  of the  Cowboys
The 70s decade aka the golden era of Sinhala cinema saw enthusiastic film directors making films of diverse genres.
Whilst art house films were made by a handful of veterans in this period, an array of comedy films too were made by a set of experienced directors that attracted the masses.
Each of these films enjoyed a healthy market share.
Kolamba Sanniya a comedy film directed by Manik Sandrasagara of Seetha Devi fame grabbed the attention of filmgoers overnight to become a box office film. The film was screened in 1976.
The story of Kolamba Sanniya revolves around some village folk lead by Andiris (played by Joe Abeywickrama) who move to Colombo after winning a massive amount of money from a lottery ticket.
Jakolis being the close associate of Andiris in the cinema was none other than the comedy king of Sinhala cinema, Eddie Jayamanne. Deneweka Hamine, Freddie Silva and young Geetha Kumarasinghe breathed life to other characters.
The film also cast a different character called Nirwasthara Mahaththaya who is hired by Colombo bound Andiris to teach his team the etiquettes practiced by Colombo 7 people.
Andiris and Jakolis sending the next-door foreign lady, a pumpkin wrapped in toilet paper was so amusing. The song Dum Barabaage in the film too thrilled the audiences.
A remake of Kolamba Sanniya directed by Harsha Udakanda is now being screened as Kolamba Sanniya Returns.
The original screenplay has been subtly changed by Harsha to add value to the storyline. New changes brought in to the story make it more contemporary.
Seasoned actor Sarath Kothalawala plays the role of Andiris in Kolamba Sanniya Returns. Other characters are played by Meneka Maduwanthi, Rajitha Hiran, Sanett Dikkumbura, D B Gangodatenna, Kumuduni Adikarai and Rasika Nimali Delwala.
Sarath Kothalawala remarkably does justice to Andiriss character to remind filmgoers of Joe Abeywickramas original performance in the 1976 film. Meneka Maduwanthi harmonizes her character so well with that of Sarath Kothalawala.
Kolamba Sanniya Returns is co-produced by Sahan Abeywardene, Shermal Dilshan and Dineth. Camera is handled by Janith Gunesekera. Music scores are done by Gayan Udawatte.

RICS Sri Lanka elevates countrys Real Estate Development and Construction
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) was founded in London as the Institution of Surveyors, after a meeting of 49 surveyors at the Westminster Palace Hotel on 15th June 1868. In 1946, King George VI granted the title Royal and in 1947 this professional body became the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
Being an organization with a strong global presence, RICS involves in the promotion and enforcement of highest international standards and regulations in diverse disciplines pertaining to the development of real estate and construction.

These professionals are specifically trained, certified and regulated under a single code of ethics and regulations, which demands conforming to required standards and the resolute practice of transparency and consistency to avoid conflicts of interest.
During the colonial rule, surveying profession was an established practice in Sri Lanka, where it gradually evolved from Municipal Assessor  to the Government Valuer by 1924, parallel to the time when Royal Charter was bestowed upon the Institution of Surveyors. RICS Sri Lanka was established in 2003, in a bid to extend the globally acclaimed RICS services to the country, while giving an opportunity for local professionals and the potential surveying students to obtain the prestigious Royal Charter accreditation.
Candidates seeking RICS membership are required to qualify in Assessment of Professional Competencies (APC) pertaining to their respective disciplines including Valuation, Quantity Surveying, Facilities Management, Project Management and Land Surveying. RICS membership manage and utilize limited resources, maintain ethics and professional integrity, in addition to facilitating Continuing Professional Development.

Property Development and construction is one of the main key areas to a countrys growth, with the potential to make a significant contribution towards the national GDP. With the advent of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Valuation expertise of Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in particular will be high in demand.
These professionals will play a pivotal role in the appraisal of assets of individual entrepreneurs and organizations who are enlisted in the Stock Exchange with a bearing on the share prices.
RICS acclaimed members will not only contribute their expertise in real estate and construction projects varying from small scale projects to mega development projects, but also involve in infrastructure development such as highways harbours as well as power generation facilities which will support Sri Lanka to unlock its untapped potential and shape the future of real estate and construction.

RIU successfully winds up Real Estate Roadshow in London for 2018
The Research Intelligence Unit (RIU) has successfully concluded its autumn Real Estate Roadshow in the United Kingdom, generating strong interest from potential investors, both of Sri Lankan origin as well as UK based entities and fund managers.
It was held at the Arab British Chamber of Commerce in Mayfair and this was RIUs second UK event for the year. It follows the successful Investor Forum conducted in May at the Sri Lankan High Commission in London. The initiative is part of RIUs strategy to promote Sri Lankas real estate and investment opportunities globally and to provide clear and reliable information for investors looking to invest in Sri Lankan real estate.
The autumn road show kicked-off on 6 October with the sponsorship of a dinner dance organised by the Old Thomians Association of UK at One Great Street, Westminster. The event included a Champagne Reception, followed by dinner and live music. A large number of high net-worth individuals of Sri Lankan origin expats attended.
On October 10, the 11th Annual International Real Estate Finance Forum (IREF) was held at the Arab British Chamber of Commerce (ABCC). A special message from the Minister of Public Enterprises, Lakshman Kiriella, was read out with a view to instilling confidence amongst the participants. The event was a full day of discourse and discussion with the participation of interested investors and leading personalities such as Robin Griffiths (ECU), Mohamed Tariq (IDB), David Testa (DDCAP) and Paul Tostevin (Savills). The Forum was followed by the IREF Emerging Markets Awards and dinner.
The IREF was immediately followed by a series of EXPO evenings on 11, 12 and 13 October. The RIU Sri Lankan Property Exhibition at ABCC focused strongly on generating sales for Sri Lankan developers by connecting them to the diaspora HNIs and London based property investors.
The final stop on the roadshow was at the Long Room, Lords Cricket Ground, London. Organised by the Executive Committee of the British Sri Lankan Association, the annual flagship event of the association was an opportunity to celebrate the successes achieved by the British Sri Lankan community.
Royalty graced the occasion along with a large number of diplomats, sports personalities, investors, investment companies and other groups of professionals.
Founding Director and CEO of RIU, Roshan Madawela, said, Tour presented a unique opportunity for real estate professionals from Sri Lanka to position the investment opportunities on the Island to not only the diaspora community but to a much broader audience, effectively placing Sri Lanka on the map as a viable emerging market for London based investors.
Moreover, he said that the week-long series of events facilitated almost 1,000 face-to-face meeting opportunities as well as other benefits like brand promotion which will have a long term benefit to the developers.
Leading developers who took part in the roadshow included Shangri-La, Altair, Dustin Thani, Blue Ocean, Capital Trust, Global Housing, H & H Golding and White House.

A salutary move
The declaration made by President Maithripala Sirisena that the much delayed Provincial Council Election will be held soon would be welcomed by those who cherish democracy. Elections are the lifeblood of democracy as the saying goes and any attempt to postpone elections on some pretext is unacceptable in a democratic setup.
It is in this manner that Provincial Council elections were circumvented by the former regime through a process of gerrymandering with legislation in Parliament. Currently six PCs are without people's representation and are run by Administrative Officers.
Speaking at the Vap Magul ceremony in Tissamaharama, President Sirisena said that six Provincial Councils are in a helpless state due to lack of a precise political leadership or guidance. The officials can accomplish tasks to a certain extent with circulars, but there must be a people-oriented political leadership that offers better services, he pointed out.
True, administrative officers are mere ciphers, working in accordance with ARs and FRs as is the case. They lack contact with the populace, particularly in rural areas where the peoples needs are more in evidence. They tend to merely issue orders and leave it at that without bothering to see if the task is completed, which is typical of Sri Lanka's public service. On the other hand, politicians get more involved to ensure the people receive the full relief, since they are elected representatives and they would want the voters to repeat the favour next time around. President Sirisena who is an accomplished grassroots politician is only too aware of this.
Provincial Councils were introduced as part of the Indo-Lanka Accord with the intention of devolving power to the provinces, as a means of inhibiting any separatist ambitions they may entertain. This is indeed a praiseworthy proposition. But in practical terms, provincial councils have come to be known as white elephants guzzling public funds for little or no return.
It is also common knowledge that our provincial councils are packed with siblings and progeny of Parliamentarians and serve as a finishing school of sorts for the next step of entering Parliament. This state of affairs should end and our PCs made a truly representative body that comprises individuals who are aware of the true aspirations of the people. Above all, it is essential to ensure that provincial councils are corruption free and public funds utilized for the maximum benefit of the people. The Western Provincial council was embroiled in a controversy recently after ordering expensive chairs and air fresher machines. Such incidents should not be repeated in other provincial councils.
As stated above, PCs were originally intended as a mechanism of devolution for the people of the North. However since this was legally not possible all nine provinces were given PCs, although it was only in 2013 that the North got theirs, due to the intervening war years. However, the North continues to languish behind the other provinces, a fact that was brought home by the President.
At the same Vap Magul ceremony the President said that the people who were given responsibilities failed to respond to the issues of the people of the North during the last three and half years, adding that the proposed housing projects for the people of the North were limited to mere Cabinet discussions.
What the President left unsaid was that it was difficult to reach consensus on this and other important issues by a Cabinet which was divided. Clashes during Cabinet meetings were the norm then with no consensus reached on virtually anything. As a result much of the work was deferred or put off altogether resulting in development work coming to a standstill.
Now, with the advent of the new regime that is composed of members belonging to a single political party consensus is bound to emerge on the direction the economy and the country should move. Hopefully, the new Cabinet would take up the matter of the housing projects in the North at the first instance while also attending to other issues affecting the people who underwent much suffering.
Meanwhile, the observation made by General Secretary of the National Economic Council (NEC) Prof. Lalith Samarakoon, which we carried on our front page yesterday, that investor and business confidence in the economy should be a priority under the new dispensation, should be considered with due seriousness by the new rulers. He said the political transitional period needed to be managed prudently and the Government should be serious about our credit worthiness.
It is only too well known that investor confidence was low under the former regime with foreign investors pulling out of the Bourse. No worthy project got underway despite grandiose pronouncements like the Volkswagen car assembly plant which later became an object of much derision.
The main reason for the breakdown in investor confidence was political instability. No investor would risk his money in a situation where the two main leaders of the Government held diametrically opposite views on such matters as the direction of the economy. This issue has now been resolved much to the relief of all concerned stakeholders.

Sharma, Rayudu tons set up Indias 224-run ODI victory
MUMBAI, Monday: Rohit Sharma hailed his "game-changer" partnership with fellow centurion Ambati Rayudu to set up India's 224-run win over West Indies in Monday's fourth one-day international.
Sharma, who smashed 162, and Rayudu, who made 100, put on 211 runs for the third wicket to power the hosts to 377-5 after electing to bat first at Mumbai's Brabourne Stadium.
India then bowled out the tourists for 153 in 36.2 overs to lead the five-match series 2-1. Paceman Khaleel Ahmed and left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav took three wickets each.
Skipper Jason Holder hit an unbeaten 54 for West Indies after they were reduced to 101-8 and staring at the prospect of suffering their biggest ever ODI loss. They lost to South Africa by 257 runs in 2015.
It was India's third-biggest victory margin after their 257-run triumph over Bermuda in 2007 followed by the 256-run mauling of Hong Kong the next year.
The day belonged to Sharma who took apart the West Indies bowling, hitting 20 fours and 4 sixes during his 137-ball stay at the crease.
"Very clinical performance from us after losing two early wickets," said Sharma, who also took three sharp catches while fielding at slip, after receiving the man of the match award.
"A big partnership was the game-changer, and in all four games we've had big partnerships that have allowed us to stay in the game and post big totals."
Sharma -- the only batsman to hit three ODI double centuries -- took control after the hosts lost their in-form captain Virat Kohli for 16.
Sharma put on 71 runs with opening partner Shikhar Dhawan, who was the first to go off pace bowler Keemo Paul for 38.
Kohli, who came into the game at the back of three successive centuries, was caught behind off paceman Kemar Roach. He has accumulated 420 runs in his four innings of the series so far.
While Kohli hit 140 in India's opening win, his next two tons had contrasting results with the second match ending in a tie and West Indies winning the third game.
'TOO MANY RUNS'
Sharma, who made an unbeaten 152 in India's opening win, got to his 21st century in just 98 deliveries and went on to register his seventh 150 plus score in 192 ODIs.
Off-spinner Ashley Nurse finally got Sharma's wicket as the batsman sliced the ball to short third-man and Chandrapaul Hemraj took an excellent catch.
Rayudu kept up the pace at one end to get to his third ODI century but was run out soon after reaching the three-figure mark.
In reply, West Indies lost three of their top batsmen for just 20 runs, including two run outs that spelt disaster for the tourists' chase.
The 20-year-old Ahmed then rattled the opposition middle-order with his left-arm pace bowling as he returned career-best figures of 3-13 from his five overs in just his 5th ODI.
Yadav then spun into action to wipe off the West Indies tail with three lower-order strikes.
"We didn't play well enough today. We allowed them to score too many runs. We never got going with the bat and the application definitely was not there," said Holder.
"The structure of the team probably needs to be looked at and obviously I want to get up the order as well," said Holder, who bats at number seven.
The fifth and final ODI is on Thursday in Thiruvananthapuram. AFP

Shifting the economy  to top gear
As Sri Lanka faces the twin evils of a political as well as an economic crisis, National Economic Council (NEC) Secretary General Prof. Lalith Samarakoon in an interview with the Daily News spelt out the dangers of what we are looking at and the possible measures the government could take to bring the economy back from the brink.
Excerpts follow:
Q. Could you explain what the roleof the NEC has been so far and what it has achieved
A. The National Economic Council (NEC) was established last year to create an institution where economic decision-making takes place in a disciplined and systematic manner, rather than in an ad hoc or inconsistent manner.
At this point, we are strengthening the NEC. It has three important pillars: economic affairs, financial affairs, and fiscal affairs. So we can map out the entire economy with these three components. We have deputy secretary generals in charge of each section and we are recruiting more people and moving to our new office at WTC in November.
We are also forming a National Think Tank to get experts of various kinds to help with national economic matters. The NEC also proposed a jobs-and-growth programme  an economic revitalisation strategy to be included in the next Budget where the focus is creating jobs and enhancing the income of the people in this country.
I proposed a national economic programme which was accepted by the NEC and consisted of macroeconomic and microeconomic growth strategies at the grassroots level, and also, structural reforms that are needed for the countrys economic progress. It was through the National Economic programme that the NEC proposed the Rapid Rural Economic Programme (RREP). However, it was later taken over and renamed by the Finance Ministry and implemented as Gamperaliya. The implementation was not in the way that we proposed.
Gamperaliya and the loan programme, Enterprise Sri Lanka, are good, but later it took a political turn and whether it was really creating entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka is a question. Did the programme actually undertake a feasibility study of the proposals put forward and only then issue loans Was that procedure followed It is doubtful.
What we proposed through the RREP was to provide Rs. 50 billion for a three-year project and in every grama niladhari (GN) division, 10 projects would be identified  either individual or small company  and they would be given seed capital to start their enterprises. The main aim was to create jobs. We have around 14,000 GN divisions. We can give seed capital to at least 150,000 and even if one creates two jobs per project, we have 300,000 jobs created.
Providing entrepreneurs with loans and having them build their businesses is very difficult. They have to bear the burden of the loan too. Usually, entrepreneurs are funded by venture capitalists who can take that risk, not through loans. Also, the success rate of new businesses is low. If you start 100, only 10 would succeed. And when we give all these people loans, they are going to be in trouble, and then Enterprise Sri Lanka says that the government would subsidise these loans, and that would be through state banks, funded by the Treasury. Eventually the entrepreneurs wont pay, affecting the banking system.
Because of this, by next year, the number of non-performing loans would increase, creating a big issue in our banking system. We need to recognise this and create a real production economy through jobs. And the state cannot do that, so we need to develop small- and medium-scale entrepreneurs. That is what we have proposed, and we are awaiting funding. If we receive the necessary funds, the NEC will implement it.
One of the key things we also did was to discuss the fertilizer issue with paddy farmers. We brought 200 farmer organisation leaders to the Agriculture Ministry for the discussion and it was very clear that what they wanted was not cash but fertilizer. So we reformulated the fertilizer subsidy as a kind strategy, not cash.
We also met with a lot of local industries and spoke to them of their issues. In terms of things with which we did not agree, we did not endorse the automatic fuel pricing formula strategy. The NEC also advocated not shifting the Public Debt Management from the Central Bank to the Finance Ministry.
There are 10 members in the NEC: the President (Chairman), Prime Minister, Finance Minister, Central Bank Governor, NEC Secretary General, Secretary to the President, Secretary to the PM, Finance Ministry Secretary, Secretary to the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry, and the Cabinet Secretary.
It is important to realise that we have a very methodical way of handling economic matters.
When economic matters are brought to the NEC (even through line ministries), we first have technical meetings where we discuss the matter with the relevant stakeholders and if approved, then we take it to the formal meeting of the NEC, and thereafter, to the Cabinet for approval. Here you see the political authority and the bureaucracy working together. The President and PM working together, and we report directly to the Cabinet.
This is a systematic process of economic decision-making and this is important no matter which government is in power. If you are to manage a countrys economy, you need a centralised system where ideas are filtered, without ad hoc decisions made, or line ministries putting their own Cabinet papers about the economy. And solutions have to look at the social, economic and environmental aspects and this institution has the capability to do that. We have thus created that framework and it is within that framework that economic decisions would be made in future and we assure the people and investors that we have created a disciplined approach. This creates predictability and trustworthiness in the economic system.
The NEC will also provide guidance and review of Budget proposals.
Our country should be growth-oriented. Growth is at a low rate. In the last three years, it fell further. In 2017, we recorded the lowest growth rate after 16 years with 3.3 percent. Considering our economic issues, we need strategies that would raise incomes of families and that can only be done through higher growth. So the Budget should focus on higher growth and outline how that should be that be done: through private industry, FDI or small- and medium-scale enterprises.
We also discussed the depreciation of the rupee many times at the NEC and heard from the Central Bank and the Finance Ministry and brought key industry figures and academics from around the country to a NEC meeting and asked them for their views.
We want to give people a forum to come and express their views freely so that the policymakers can listen to them when crafting their policies.
At present, the Budget scheduled for November has been postponed. So there needs to be another Vote on Account and thereafter, the Budget is probably going to be presented by January.
We want to strengthen the NEC so that no matter which government, we will have stable economic policy decision-making. We are going to bring in an Act of Parliament to make it a statutory and permanent body of the government. A year later, we now understand the best possible way to manage the NEC.
Q. Could you speak of thecurrent economic situationwe are in
A. There are certain fundamental factors we have to recognise. One is the low economic growth. In the last four years, it has shown a decreasing trend (2014  5 percent, 2015  5 percent, 2016  4.5 percent and 2017  3.3 percent).
To resolve our economic issues, we need to grow consistently at about 810 percent for 10 years. But low growth rate was always what we saw, and it never really took off.
Second is the depreciation of the rupee. We know that the depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee has accelerated in the recent past. As of Friday, the rupee depreciated by 12 percent this year, the highest between 2010 and 2018; in 2012 it was at 10.4 percent. This is a good indicator of the state of the economy. If you look at why, the answer is that we have twin deficits  Current Account and Budget.
Of course, the depreciation of the rupee has been worsened by external factors such as the increase in US Federal Reserve interest rates, but that was 100 percent predictable. In 2015, we were told they would increase interest rates, and the first increase was in 2015. The Federal Reserve also said there would be increases in future too. We knew that too. So we should have been more prepared. We should have encouraged more FDI  only last year we got US$ 1.9 billion, otherwise it has always been less than US$ 1 billion. All along, we did not attract FDI on a large scale, and our foreign reserves never developed.
In the Current Account balance this year we have a deficit of 2.9 percent. In 2017, it was 2.6 percent. This is high. This means that our imports are greater than our exports, more demand for foreign exchange than supply. And as the Current Account deficit grows, it affects our foreign exchange reserves.
In 2017, we had a 5.5 percent budget deficit, in 2016 it was 5.4 percent, and in 2015, it was 7.6 percent. In our country, after 2010, the Budget deficit has never been below 5 percent. The lowest was 5.4 percent. And this year, 5.3 percent. We have a very high budget deficit which is not sustainable.
The current economic crisis is common to many countries, but we need to overcome these twin deficits and develop Budget and Current Account surpluses.
To have a Current Account surplus, we need to have more exports and like the government was saying, have an export economy, but sadly, it was something we have been saying from 1977, and it is not something we should be saying in 2018 too. What did we do all these years
The Budget deficit is a sign of not developing an export sector to compete in global markets and we have lived beyond our means.
When a common currency was agreed upon in Europe, all countries agreed to two rules: the Budget deficit should not be more than 3 percent, and the debt to GDP ratio should not be more than 60 percent in each country. But many did not follow this and are now in crisis.
Even the so-called developed countries fell into crisis because they deviated from economic fundamentals. This is a good lesson for us.
Our debt to GDP ratio last year was 78 percent, this year it is 77 percent. Along with the 5.3 percent Budget deficit this year, the pattern is clear. It is not necessarily the amount of debt, it is whether we can afford it and pay back.
From 20192023, we have a large mountain of debt to repay. Next year, we have to pay back over US$ 5 billion, and from then on, US$ 46 billion in foreign debt (principal and interest).
This is the reality any future government will have to tackle. We can look at short-term solutions, but we have now exhausted even those options, we have now come to the end of our journey.
We now have only US$ 78 billion in foreign reserves and we need at least US$ 5 billion for four to five months imports. With the rest, we have to pay back loans. We have around US$ 1.4 billion invested in Treasury bonds and capital markets, and the worse the crisis, the faster they will leave.
In my opinion, we need to have at least US$ 14 billion in foreign reserves to be comfortable.
We need to tell the people and politicians, this is the reality. If this political crisis continues, with such an economic situation, there will be big problems.
The government should be serious about preserving our creditworthiness; it is critical to maintain investor and business confidence in the Sri Lankan economy. If we lose that, we will have trouble raising money for the loans we have to repay. Whichever government comes into power, we have no alternative but to take loans to repay loans and that can be done only if our credit ratings are good. It is important that the economy is handled prudently and carefully during this period of transition. We need to maintain our ability to borrow from international markets. Credit rating agencies are watching us closely.
We are in a very tricky situation. We need to recognise this and manage the economy during this difficult situation. We need to maintain fiscal discipline and move towards a growth strategy. The next Budget would be functioning in this economic crisis and will be a decisive one and would have to tackle these issues.
We have had positives, but right now the negatives are outweighing them. The responsibility of the government in the next six months is to stabilise the economy. FDI and export growth cannot be done overnight.
So in the short term, that includes imposing certain import controls on non-essential luxury items and establishing a monitoring mechanism to ensure that exporters bring back export revenue within the stipulated 120 days  we may have to even look at shortening that time period.
Also, we need to think of emergency lines of credit, borrowings, and credit facilities from other Central Banks and governments to build foreign reserves.
Then our own capital markets have to be developed, including capital formation and savings.
In the recent past, the government wanted to increase revenue through taxation, but that alone will not solve our problems. Tax policy has to be reviewed in the next Budget. It is a burden to the common people, businesses are complaining about it, and changes in the tax policy are ad hoc.
Also, we have a luxury state structure with wasteful expenditure not suited to our country. So the Budget should focus on reducing wasteful expenditure; the state can then give concessions to the people and tax luxury items (which is fair). If the people are not with us, nothing can be done. They need to live on their wages.
Our economic philosophy should be liberalising trade carefully by looking at the advantages and disadvantages of bilateral agreements. We have to look at their feasibility. We have to trade with other countries, but we have to be careful whether we need to sign multilateral and bilateral agreements without analysis first.
Then domestic agriculture must be made profitable through proper subsidies, incentives and marketing. This is also important for food security. It is fundamental to our thinking.
Lastly, local industries which are contributing to our economy, GDP, jobs and income need to be encouraged. Existing industries should be given incentives and protection as necessary. For example, the government introduced the sugar tax for health reasons. It was fair, but it affected local fruit juice manufacturers who were mostly selling to local retailers. Their prices went up by Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 and sales reduced.
On the other hand, the Agriculture Ministry and other agencies were promoting fruit cultivation and production, but they couldnt sell with this tax. This is an example of inconsistencies in taxation. When we spoke to the Finance and Health Ministries, they said they cant change the tax and then the local manufacturers were complaining. So when we make policies, they have to be balanced.
Local industries must be preserved; all countries from Thailand to Japan to the US are doing this. Trump is renegotiating trade deals as the US experienced large-scale job losses and erosion in the industrial base as a result of free trade agreements and globalisation. When the world is moving towards protectionism, we have to understand that there is a reason for this. Even China is focusing on developing its domestic economy. We are trying to repeat what was happening 20 years ago, and not responding to current market trends.
If we integrate too much into the global market, global shocks will always affect us. To minimise this, we need to have our own domestic markets developed; we can trade, but first we must protect our own.

Speaker cannot challenge  Presidents powers - NFF
National Freedom Front (NFF) Media Spokesman Mohammed Muzammil said yesterday that Speaker Karu Jayauriya does not have any powers to challenge the Presidents Executive powers.
He said the Speaker has made various statements about the prorogation of Parliament by President Maithripala Sirisena.
The President has special powers to prologue Parliament for two months under extraordinary circumstances, but so far he has prorogued Parliament by only 11 days.
Speaking at a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, Muzammil said if the Speaker tries to convene a Parliament that has been prorogued by President Sirisena, he too becomes a part of an anti-government conspiracy.
We hope that he will not tarnish his image by getting involved in this matter. Even on earlier occasions, several former Presidents did not inform the former Speakers when they prorogued Parliament. There is no legal requirement to inform the Speaker. If the Speaker has any problem with regard to this, he should consult the Attorney-General. Otherwise, he can obtain a determination from the Supreme Court, Muzammil said.
The Speaker cannot challenge the Presidents decision which is consistent with the Constitution. The AG has in fact ruled that the Presidents decision is legal and lawful, he said.
People again have hope of a new journey for the country as a result of the Presidents brave decision taken last Friday. The UNP-JVP coalition is obstructing the new journey of the government. Although they acted as separate parties, various comments made by these party members show that they have a connection with each other. All of them want the reconvening of Parliament, he said.
The powers belonging to the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary are enshrined in theConstitution. Parliament cannot challenge the Executive powers of the President. There is no provision that the Prime Minister should be appointed with the approval of Parliament, Muzammil said.
NFF MP Padma Udaya Shantha said the UNP wants to destabilise the country by organising protests in Colombo with the participation of underworld gangs and extremists. They want to show the international community that this country is unstable.
But we have strong patriotic forces to defeat all these efforts, he said.
Former Minister Sajith Premadasa brings crowds to the protest to show his ability to become the next leader, while former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe brings crowds to consolidate his leadership in the party, Udaya Shantha said.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist with regard to the assassination plot on the President and the former Defence Secretary, he said an investigation should be conducted to probe how former Minister Rajitha Senaratne has the voice recordings of Namal Kumara and DIG Nalaka Silva while the investigation is being conducted by the CID.

Sri Lankan entrepreneurs  discuss innovation challenges
A panel of high-profile Sri Lankan entrepreneurs, many of them graduates of Australian universities, discussed the challenges and opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka, at an event organised by the Australian High Commission and Australia Sri Lanka Alumni (ASLA) on October 25, in Colombo.
The Innovation and Entrepreneurship Q&A highlighted the need for business, finance and government to be more tolerant of the risks associated with entrepreneurial activity. It also emphasised the private sectors leading role in fostering a broader cultural change in attitude toward innovation and entrepreneurship.
The need to address challenges faced by female entrepreneurs in setting up a business, assuring financial institutions of their credit worthiness and building a credible brand, were other key discussion topics.
All the panellists pointed out that in order to take greater advantage of the countrys location in relation to the South and East Asian markets, Sri Lankan businesses should think regionally and globally.
The Q&A session was moderated by Bernadine Jayasinghe, award-winning TV news anchor and presenter, with an audience of Australian alumni and other guests. The panel of innovators and entrepreneurs comprised Lahiru Pathmalal, alumni of University of Queensland and Founder and Managing Director of Takas.lk; Manik Suriyaaratchi, alumni of Swinburne University and Managing Director, Omega Global; Raj Alagendran, alumni of University of Wollongong, and Chief Operating Officer at CurisOne; and Selyna Peries, Director Business Development at Seyln. Australian High Commissioner Bryce Hutchesson said, Events such as this and the networking they encourage are another way in which Australia is seeking to help build a critical mass of Sri Lankans with an interest in how the economy can be more outward-looking and resilient.
The Australia Sri Lanka Alumni network has been established to connect the many thousands of Sri Lankans who have studied in Australia. This number is growing fast. There are more than 10,500 enrollments by Sri Lankan students to study in Australia in 2018.
Another key focus of the discussion was the challenges faced by women entrepreneurs in setting up a business, assuring financial institutions of their creditworthiness and building a credible brand.
All panellists said Sri Lankan businesses should take greater advantage of the countrys location.

Large-scale currency fraud unearthed
Suspects collected millions: Police
Panadura Walana Central Police unearthed a massive currency fraud running to millions of rupees through banks when they arrested four foreigners while conducting a raid at a house at Temple Road in Mount Lavinia on Saturday.
Police took into custody three laptops, four counterfeit currency notes of Rs. 5,000 denomination, five mobile phones, a bundle of receipts and suspicious documents.
Three Ugandan nationals and one Nigerian allegedly engaged in the fraud were taken into custody for questioning.
Police traced the fraud when they arrested the Nigerian possessing five Rs. 5,000 counterfeit currency notes, while he was in Batakettara in Peliyandala on Friday.
He came out with the information when he was questioned. Later, Walana Central Police raided the rented house at Temple Road and arrested the other suspects who allegedly misled businessmen and others to credit to the accounts of the suspects to the value of prizes offered to them regarding a draw under two foreign companies.
They had told businessmen that there was a draw conducted by two foreign companies and the prizes had reached the Katunayaka International Airport, and that to release the items, the prize winners had to deposit money to the bank accounts of the three suspects and receipts should be forwarded to the address given by them.
According to Walana Central Police, the four suspects had collected millions of rupees in this way and dispatched money to foreign banks under their names.
The Counterfeit Currency Investigations Branch is expected to take over investigations in this regard. The suspects had been in operation for the last three to four years in Sri Lanka, police said.

Symphony for  little souls
The much acclaimed Josephian Choir bearing the flamboyant title St. Cecilias Choir of St. Josephs College will perform at the Lionel Wendt on November 4 at 7 pm in aid of the medical needs of HIV positive children. This is their second choral event in aid of children needing medical care, this year.
Symphony for a Child is the brainchild of Srima Jayasekera, an accomplished pianist and an excellent teacher who spent much of her life in London. She was also driven by a burning passion to help children with medical needs, back in Sri Lanka. Thus, the yearly concert featuring the best in the western music tradition was put together as a much-awaited event at the Regent Hall in Central London. With funds so raised, she was able to maintain two childrens wards and a play area at the IDH Hospital Angoda.
In recognition of her work in aid of the needy children in Sri Lanka, Jayasekera was honoured by his Royal Highness Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall at a reception at St. Jamess Palace, London.
She did not stop at that but went on to help rural youth in pursuit of excellence in its full gamut going from primary education even up to a PhD. She as always epitomizes the human craving for compassion by demonstrating how far a single person can go to make this world a better place.
Thus, Aunty Srima, the 86 year old musician as she is popularly known, has combined her dual driving forces  passion for music and compassion for those suffering and has come forward to present her famous annual charity concerts in Sri Lanka since her return to the Island a few years ago.
This year through a measure of fortuitous circumstances she, in partnership with the Sri Lankan AIDS Foundation, has obtained the involvement of the Josephian choir, locally and internationally known as St. Cecilias Choir of St. Josephs College, Colombo. They will be the main performers in this years concert which will also include a few other renowned musicians and dancers.
The Josephians are well known for their celestial performances in Sri Lanka, Rome, Jerusalem and Bethlehem. They possess a great variety of styles and language skills culled from the ancient to the modern.
The envisaged concert will commence with their rendition of the National Anthem in splendid four-part harmony followed by Va Pensiero [Verdi] which is also known as The Slaves Chorus sung in Italian. Continuing will be Handels For Unto Us which is an exciting and demanding composition.
Then comes a poignant, modern Latin piece Stabat Mater. Daniel Vaz, a 16-year-old soprano with the honour of winning a prestigious scholarship to the UK at the conclusion of an island-wide competition conducted this year by the British Federation for Performing Arts (Sri Lankan Section), will sing the rousing Climb Every Mountain from the musical Sound of Music. This segment will end with a stirring African chorus Baba Jetu.
In the post-interval segment the Josephian singers will present the popular ABBA Medley with the fine elegance it demands. Geeyakin Messe will come next followed by the Tamil oldie Pathu Pada Va. Moving on to the dance segment they will present Somewhere My Love and Falling in Love. Next comes a solo version of the Sinhala pop song Chandrayawan, backed by the tenors and basses. The concert will conclude with the excellent version of the sadly sweet Italian song time to say goodbye
The concert is so arranged as to include the ChoralSpectrum, RavibanduVidhyapathi Dancers, Amithya Liyanage, Rushanie Fernando, Darshana Amerasinghe, Manoj Wijeyawardene, Antonette Wheelan, Lakmal Nanayakkara and soprano Ridmavi Anthony, all performing multiple forms of artistic expressions. Also, await the piano and violin performances of young Yevan Athurupanda.
This noteworthy event is sponsored by the Sri Lanka AIDS Foundation to help children affected by AIDS and is presented under the guidance of Sirima Jayasekera, a legend in her own right.

Almost 10 percent of children in Raja Rata lose protein along with urine, a recent study revealed, said Dr. Channa Jayasumana of the Raja Rata University.
This is an initial sign of impending kidney aliments, he said, and added that water filters should be installed in all schools to provide drinking water to schoolchildren, Dr. Jayasumana said.
The farmer population in Raja Rata is prone to kidney problems. Each farmer family had at least one kidney patient among them, he said.
He said while people were subjected to cancer and kidney problems, others engaged in a power struggle are giving scant regard to this problem.
He said the Anuradhapura district had recorded 44,000 kidney patients.
There are nearly 80,000 kidney patients throughout the country.
Altogether, 25,000 kidney patients had succumbed to the disease in recent times," he said.

Thompson breaks three-point record as Warriors gore Bulls
Chicago, Tuesday: Klay Thompson scored a record-breaking 14 three-pointers as the Golden State Warriors maintained their blistering start to the season with a 149-124 demolition of the Chicago Bulls on Monday.
Thompson broke teammate Stephen Currys NBA record for most three-point field goals in a single game of 13 when he nailed his 14th three of the night midway through the third quarter at the United Center.
The 28-year-old Thompson -- who has struggled to find his scoring touch in the opening weeks of the season -- finished the game with 52 points as the Warriors improved to 6-1 in the Western Conference.
Thompson had set the tone for a superb display in the first quarter when he exploded for 22 points to help the reigning NBA champions surge into a 44-28 lead.
The Dubs put up another 48 points in the second quarter, and reached the halftime buzzer leading by an incredible 42-point margin at 92-50.
With the game as good as won, it became simply a question of whether the red-hot Thompson would surpass Currys three-pointer benchmark.
Thompson tied Currys mark with his 13th three of the night with 7:12 remaining in the third quarter and then bagged his 14th with just under five minutes left after coolly draining a shot from the edge of the arc.
Unsurprisingly, Thompsons 52-point haul led the scoring with Curry adding 23 points and laying on five assists.
Kevin Durant had 14 points while Alfonzo McKinnie came off the bench to weigh in with 19 points. Quinn Cook also had 14 points off the bench.
Elsewhere on Monday, the eagerly anticipated match-up between the leagues last two unbeaten teams, the Eastern Conference-leading Toronto and Milwaukee, saw the Bucks run out winners by 124-109.
The Bucks were missing Greek star Giannis Antetokounmpo, who was placed in the NBAs concussion protocol earlier Monday after suffering a blow to the head against Orlando at the weekend.
The Raptors meanwhile were missing Kawhi Leonard, opting to rest the star forward for the contest.
With Antetokounmpo missing, the Bucks spread the scoring around with no fewer than seven players reaching double figures.
Ersan Ilyasova led the scoring with 19 points while Malcolm Brogdon and Eric Bledsoe both had 17 points apiece.
The Bucks now lead the Eastern Conference with seven wins out of seven and are off to their best start since 1971-1972, a season after the club won its only NBA crown. AFP

Trump plans tent cities for Central American migrants
US: US President Donald Trump said Monday his administration was planning to build tent cities for thousands of Central American migrants making their way through Mexico to the United States.
The announcement during a Fox News interview came as the Pentagon announced it was deploying 5,200 active-duty troops to beef up security, and follows weeks of heated anti-migrant rhetoric from the president ahead of crucial midterm congressional elections next week.
If they apply for asylum, were going to hold them until such time as their trial takes place. Were going to hold them, were going to build tent cities, were gonna build tents all over the place.
Were not gonna build structures and spend all of these hundreds of millions of dollars. Were gonna have tents, theyre gonna be very nice, and theyre going to wait, and if they dont get asylum they get out. He added that asylum seekers would remain in detention while their claims were being processed, a move which he said would deter would-be applicants from coming to the US.
If you wanna wait, they dont usually get asylum. You know that. The problem is they release them in and then they have the trial, three years later, and nobody shows up.
But we are gonna, unlike Obama and unlike others, were going to take the people, were going to put them in, and theyre gonna wait.
When people find out that happens, youre gonna have far fewer people come up. Trump has been campaigning intensively for weeks, frequently hammering on the migrant caravan issue and stoking anti-immigrant concerns among voters.
He is expected to hold 11 rallies in the days ahead of the November 6 midterms, which Washington pundits are characterizing as a referendum on his presidency. - AFP

Voice in the  wilderness
All authentic prophets, modern or ancient, were voices in the wilderness yet never wavering from their stand, never compromising with power, prestige or pelf, always consistent, comprehensive and compassionate. Dr Mervyn D. De Silva is one such rare prophet from Sri Lanka in our times. I had, now and then, read some of his articles in the newspapers but this collection is a real boon to all those who are interested in the common good of not only the people of Sri Lanka, especially the poor, but of the whole world.
The world today, for those who have eyes to see and ears to hear and for intelligent and objective observers, has sunk into decadence, economically, socially, culturally, morally, ethically and seems to be immersed in a quagmire of unprecedented superficiality.
There are wars between Nations, ethnic and religious groups, social upheavals between haves and have-nots, heinous forms of crimes, domestic violence, political violence, breakdown of law and order, revolutions and counter-revolutions; corruption by the mightiest, politicians, bankers and business men, blatant violations of time-honored principles and codes of conduct and decency; blatant violation of constitutions, democracy, the judiciary and the executive organs of administration. - Page 9. Though the author starts this paragraph with the words The world today actually it is all about the current ugly situation in our own country, Sri Lanka. And that is what the subtitle of the book says: The failed Neoliberal Paradigms of Economics, Politics, Governance, Society and Science in Sri Lanka and Globally
Agriculture is the specialty of Dr Mervyn and eradication of poverty is his chosen goal in life. For him the two are connected but the powers that be are so ignorantly and culpably superficial about this connection it is tragic. the governments undertaking utterly puerile tamashas in the rural paddy fields (1977) and farmer seminars in the capital city (1996) reveals the truth that the crux of the success of the modern techniques of food production and the massive support it requires have not being properly understood by the rulers.  page 34.
Dr Mervyn has consistently shown that the root cause of every unjust and evil aspect of society is economic poverty. Whether it is hunger and starvation, violence and terrorism, overseas slave labour and human trafficking, drugs and prostitution, inequality and income disparities, ill health and failure in education, are all due to the basic fact that the majority cannot make ends meet at the end of the day. For him the eradication of poverty is top priority and the ethical, moral, social and political imperative of any responsible government.
His scathing attacks on the Washington Consensus institutions, The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization are unmatched by any leftist rhetoric. Nothing escapes his eagle eye: Glasnost-perestroika, GATT and RCN (Remote control neo-colonial status) Debt crisis and Aid, Structural adjustments, Mad cow disease, Free market, super NGOs, Privatization and Ecological disasters. He exposes their hidden agendas, double standards and hypocrisy, objectively and fearlessly.
He was in the planning ministry and later an MP in the SirimavoBandaranayakegovernment. He comments on why planning became anathema, what the proper role of the ministry is, the presidential responsibilities, performance monitoring and reorganization of the ministry. He reveals with great clarity and responsibility how democracy in our country began to erode from the seventies onward. Today it is a mere faade and the people are left utterly helpless, politically stranded and their dignity dragged in the mud.
The articles are all relevant to the immediate socio-political needs of the country; searching for solutions to vital problems; analyzing the situation and critiquing it; but always Dr Mervins basic tenets are clear and demanding; the unitary status of the country, the inalienable sovereignty of the people, a legislature of honest, committed ladies and gentlemen untainted by corruption and nepotism and the top priority of a sustained campaign to eradicate poverty not in some hazy future but within a planned rational time frame and clear deadlines.
A victim of government wrath when he exposed the Dambala Hoax Dr. Mervyn has paid dearly for his uncompromising stand against injustice, dishonesty and corruption. As the director of Tulana, Fr Aloysius Pieris SJ states; Dr De Silva insists that there can be no question of abandoning those in need.
The dire need of the hour, if we want to save this country intact for another generation, is for us all good and honest people to rouse ourselves and work together to bring about the downfall of the present governing kleptocracy; this indeed is the last plea of Dr Mervin in his collected articles; it is on page 302; Patriotic countrymen with brains, guts and courage take up the gauntlet, get on the phones, make e-mail connections, contact anyone prepared to help, assemble groups, contact professional associations, inspire confidence, do more and talk less, dont throw cold water. Lets take one step in the right direction. If the people lead, the leaders will follow our attempts to end this unapologetic barbarism. Rise up to the occasion please.
I dream somebody taking his articles and translating them into Sinhala and Tamil and publishing them,one by one, serially,in our national vernacular newspapers. I wish very much my dream comes true soon.

What your hand foretells
In general, the human being has changes in the hand in terms of shape according to the native country and region. Intelligence and talents are denoted from the shape of the hand, lines, the length of the thumb and its nature.
In both hands, ring finger is higher than the pointer and having longer indicate the fortune. Not only that but also the size and the colour of the joints of thumb indicate the achievements of the life and vice versa. This is a major sign of luck. If you have this feature on your palm, you can choose the right path to win, hence, you are able to increase your economic strength. In this case, if the centre of the ring finger consists with ring lines which are in the middle of the joints, then it must be understood that the economic strength is higher. If the two or three lines flow from the top of the finger, they will become famous for everywhere in the world. The whorl of the top joint of the ring finger is centered, it is certain that a person is a famous person. If there is a small island on those vertical lines which means he will be a leader in all aspects, such as wealth, education, and fame.
If there are two or three clear lines on the mount of Sun that is clearly known to you, he/she is definitely famous. The distortion of the heart line and the mount of Venus which can result in malicious acts in another word he is a notorious person. It is also a sign of the stars position in the mount of Sun.
The mount of the Mercury at the base of the small finger is one of the salient features of the economic strength of a person. There is a distinct feature of the area being the location of a few lines, which, in addition to those lines, is a major factor in the ability to become rich in terms of intelligence and the knowledge. Further, if the top joint of the small finger is longer than the other joints, it is a sign of intelligence. He/She can achieve success in terms of knowledge. The four joints in the small finger are also very rare. It is a growing feature of intelligence and tenderness. Those who have that feature are the successful people who involved in books, magazines and newspapers.
The main factor in rising fame, prestige and dignity is the mount of Venus located at the bottom of Thumb. If the mount is gradually tall and brightly coloured, it means that the person is a tycoon. The mount of Venus is vigorous in each and every famous and rich person. Moreover, I have empirical evidence that the mount of Venus has become more prominent in everyone who involved in the media, music and arts in my 46 years of practice.
There are two main factors in showing the power of the mind. The thumb is a prominent finger. According to its size, colour and shape, ones skill and ability are shown. The thumb shown on this figure is once having a glimpse of the reward and strength of the fastest man in the world. The flexible finger of all those who are in big fortunes will find is low.
The location of cross-links between the links is a characteristic that can be achieved with great effort. In rare cases, the thumb is shown in four joints. The presence of such a cross-lying line with the nailed joint of the thumb endings is a powerful feature. The position of such strong crossways in the middle is the position of physical strength.
The most powerful athletes in the world have a special characteristic that has won and win. The books have not given much importance to this matter. To achieve success in life, it requires good health. Especially the physical strength and power of women are shown in the bracelet lines. There are three to four lines of strong straits on the wrist. Those who have such bracelet lines are rich and powerful and well-known for longevity.

Why does not Ranil go to Courts
Why does not former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe go before the Supreme Court if his removal is illegal, asked Pivithuru Hela Urumaya General Secretary and Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila yesterday.
The former Prime Minister and the United National Party (UNP) will not petition the Supreme Court because they know very well that removing the PM is legal and and in accordance with the Constitution, MP Gammanpila said.
Addressing a press conference held at the JHU headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said only the Supreme Court has the power to interpret the constitution.
Only the Supreme Court can interpret the constitution. But still no one has sought a ruling from the Supreme Court, Gammanpila said.
Gammanpila said the former PM should follow the comply and complain in the law.
He should comply and vacate Temple Trees after handing over all state properties and then leave and after that make a formal complaint to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court accepts the Sinhala translation of the constitution as the final and not the English translation which is always used by the former PM, he said.
If he does not like to go and file a plaint in the Supreme Court, he can get the signatures of 113 MPs and hand it over to the Speaker in order to table a no confidence motion against Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and oust him,he said.
The former ministers can enter their former offices during official working hours after informing the acting Secretary of the relevant Ministry and take their personal belongings back under the supervision of the acting Secretary.They cannot enter their former offices after hours informing the former secretaries of ministries like the former Petroleum Resources Development Minister did, he added.

Former Prime Minister  was sworn in sans  majority stake in 2015
Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe and MP Keheliya Rambukwella also argued that in 2015 when Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in as the Prime Minister, he did not have the trust of the majority in Parliament.
He came to power with the backing of 41 members. We at the time had 161 members. No one questioned his appointment, everyone believed it.
MP Rambukwella added that even after August 2015, the Prime Minister still failed to retain the majority.
We believe that at least 70 percent of the population stands with our decision to form the new government and that the appointment of a new Prime Minister should be based on who yields the most trust within parliament.
No where in the Constitution does it say majority rule, added Rambukwella.
Minister Samarasinghe and MP Rambukwella called on the media to refrain from demeaning a political decision taken by Vadivel Suresh, a UNP MP to join forces with Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.
How do you know why he had met Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, Asked Minister Samarasinghe.
Do not demean his political decision to meet leaders of either party. It is purely his prerogative, he said.
Deputy Minister Vadivel Suresh had told the media that he met the newly appointed Prime Minister as a matter of courtesy.
Photos of the Minister meeting both leaders went viral on social media suggesting that the MP was bought over by the new government.
That is a very shallow decision and thinking on your part, Minister Samarasinghe rebutted.
One of the first decisions taken by the new Cabinet was to revoke a decision taken by former Minister of Mass Media and Finance to appoint a Central Bank Deputy Governor to the position of Commissioner General of the Inland Revenue Department.
The President said that he was not in agreement with the decision taken by the former Minister of Finance and that within the next week, a suitable person would be nominated and selected for the position of the Commissioner General of the IRD, Minister Samarasinghe said.
In other Cabinet decisions, CWC MP Arumugam Thondaman who was appointed as the Minister of Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development had sought approval of the Cabinet to establish a Tamil school within the Wattala Pradeshiya Sabha, which the Cabinet confirmed.
It was also decided that Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa would meet with the Elections Commissioner on the upcoming Provincial Council elections.
It was proposed by the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local government Faiszer Musthapha that the upcoming elections be looked at and to decide upon which system the polls should be held.
The Elections Commission will further discuss this matter with the new Prime Minister.

PM cannot hold position once Cabinet dissolves
Education and Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, State Plantation Industries Minister Vadivel Suresh and Deputy Wildlife and Tourism Minister Ananda Aluthgamage said that they defected not for personalities or bribes but on principle.
They were addressing the media during a briefing held yesterday at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute, after taking up posts in the new government.
The trio highlighted their reasons for joining the new government and added that they still were members of the United National Party (UNP).
Minister Rajapakshe said that disagreements in the previous regime over its policy of leasing out the Hambantota Port to a Chinese company for 99 years, the Central Bond scam, the insistence of former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to hand over the Colombo East Terminal to India without Presidential or Cabinet approval, a new Land Act to be introduced, the governments actions in Geneva, as well as the irresponsible drafting of legislation for the local and provincial government elections, were some of the reasons for his defection.
State Minister Suresh, in the meantime, said his request from the former PM to intervene on behalf of the estate workers and increase their wage to Rs.1,000 per day had gone unheeded, but President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa had agreed to it. He added that he only knew he would receive the portfolio when he was called to the Presidential Secretariat on Monday evening. Deputy Minister Aluthgamage said he was frustrated with the party for the last three years as power was concentrated at the top, with very little concern for the grassroots.
Rajapakshe said that the President's actions were constitutional and that if he could appoint former PM Wickremesinghe with just 47 members in Parliament in 2015, he also had the powers to appoint Rajapaksa as the new PM. Further, he said that the 19th Amendment stated that if the Cabinet stood dissolved, the PM would no longer hold his position. At present, however, the challenge was going to Parliament to pass a interim or Budget, or if they had to face a Motion of No Confidence from the UNP.
'Do we have the numbers' that is the question, he said.
According to the Parliament order paper, the first order of business was the Budget; So the priority of the government is the Budget. If we cant take the government forward, the President has to dissolve the Parliament.
The United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) desires that, so they may vote against it, Rajapakshe said; The results may mean that the UNP will lose more seats.
When asked if the President had the powers to dissolve Parliament prior to 4 years as stipulated under the 19th Amendment, he said that under the Westminster System, the Constitution has inherent powers allowing the President to do so, if he feels he cannot carry out the business of the government. Either way, a defeat of the Budget could spell a general election.
He added that the Speaker could not summon Parliament once the President had prorogued it and that the Speaker had conceded to it in writing yesterday and requested that the President take into consideration the demands to have Parliament summoned: Only the President can convene Parliament now and once that is done, the Speaker will have his powers to summon the restored Parliament.
A journalist questioned Rajapakshe as to why he voted against the previous No Confidence Motion (NCM) against Wickremesinghe if he did not support him. He said that the Joint Opposition and Mahinda Rajapaksa provided no alternative candidate and that he refused to support a move which could cause instability in the country:
When the PM asked me about the NCM, I said I was going to vote against it not because I liked him, but because I did not want the country to fall into chaos, given that it would take months to find a new PM at that time. As journalists questioned whether they would have the numbers required in Parliament to run the government, Aluthgamage replied, We left knowing we have the numbers; we left to win.

Those involved in proroguing Parliament now shedding crocodile tears
Politicians who were involved in the most controversial incidents such as proroguing Parliament are now shedding crocodile tears claiming that President Maithripala Sirisena has violated the countrys democracy by proroguing Parliament for only 11 days, UPFA Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma said.
He was speaking at a media conference at the Prime Ministers Office yesterday.
During the Parliamentary history of the country, Parliament has been prorogued 24 times. Some of those incidents were very unpleasant and anti-democratic, the MP said.
MP Alahapperuma said in 1991, then President Ranasinghe Premadasa prorogued Parliament to buy time to scuttle an impeachment motion against him, and in 2015, Parliament was dissolved before presentation of the COPE report by D.E.W. Gunasekera. He alleged that former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe was behind these two incidents.
The Budget 2019 was scheduled to be presented to Parliament on November 5 and since the present government needs some time to prepare the Budget, Parliament was prorogued only for 11 days. The US State Department, international forces and Wickremesinghe are trying to misinterpret this incident as a violation of democracy, Alahapperuma said.
He said the European Union and US State Department are attempting to intervene in this domestic issue at the request of former Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and India, Russia, China and other countries do not intervene in our domestic issues.
Without any hesitation, Wickremesinghe called for the UN peacekeeping force to be deployed to Sri Lanka and he didnt make this type of requests to defeat the LTTE. But none of these foreign elements acted like this when the elections were postponed for a long period, he said.
He made a request from the Bhikkus who are going to chant pirith at Temple Trees to chant Parabhawa Sutta and Atanatoya Sutta for 100,000 times and he also asked the police to take necessary measures to ensure the security of former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who held the Prime Ministers position and Opposition Leaders position four times.
Speaking at the media conference, UPFA Parliamentarian Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said that Sri Lanka is not a country ruled under the Westminster system of Parliamentary government and the Constitution is a combination of the French and US government systems. So the Executive President has the authority to take the decision of the position of Prime Minister.
Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara said that under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, anybody can file a fundamental rights case against the President if the appointment of present Prime Minister is illegal. But without doing that, Wickremesinghe is seeking assistance from Western diplomats.
The US State Department and some other international institutions are making various statements and they are using the word arbitrary and we ask them to remove that word from their statements, he said.
Nanayakkara said the JVP is also fulfilling a contract of the UNP by forcing the President to convene Parliament. We are not opposing that. But the Executive President has to fulfill his responsibilities before convening Parliament. Parliamentarians Mahinda Yapa Abeywardane and Sisira Jayakody also spoke at the media conference.

Time to prioritise green logistics  development initiatives and policies
The International training programme on Green Freight and Logistics Development has concluded at the Thai International Cooperation Agency in Bangkok, Thailand, recently.
The training programme aims to promote awareness of the importance of sustainable practices in the transport and logistics industry by bringing together 19 participants from various countries spanning three continents; Burundi, Cambodia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Jordan, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao PDR, Madagascar, Malawi, Morocco, Panama, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Tunisia, and Zambia.
While addressing the final session of the training programme, Chitral Jayawarna, Deputy Chief Manager (Communication & Public Relation Division), Sri Lanka Ports Authority, has stressed the importance of applying green logistic initiatives and policies in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka going to implement green logistics development initiatives to develop the projects and already mapping the strategies for developing the projects such as green warehousing facilities, e-Docs (Electronic Document Management System),e-Port Permits issue system, e RTGs and some e initiatives for logistics operations, he said.
He also added by saying that the transport sector should have to restructure with new technologies to reduce carbon emission.
Sri Lankan government is encouraging people to use electric vehicles. Currently, more than 15% of vehicles are electric vehicles in Sri Lanka; this is a benchmark in the region. It is time government to subsidies for more green initiatives such as green transportation to get maximum benefits while protecting the environment.
Sri Lanka can promote electric bike and three-wheelers. It is very important and convenient transportation mode suit for Sri Lanka. Statistically, in 2017, close to 35 million electric bikes were sold globally and out of over 90% was in China alone. In 2016 the total electric bike fleets on Chinas roads were about 20 million.
The market projections indicate that the global electric bike sale could reach 40 million in 2025, and about 50 million in 2035 and could be completely electrified by 2045.
Freight transport is responsible for around 90% of all logistics emissions. The logistics creates around 10-12% of logistics emissions. Logistics-related Green House Gass (GHG) emissions typically 3-15% of carbon footprint of consumer goods (Source: SLoCaT, World Economic Forum).
New Urban Agenda is very important to sustainable development; therefore, New Urban Agenda for Sri Lanka is very vital. New Urban Agenda was unanimously adopted at the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III), serving as a new vision for our cities and municipalities for the next 20 years.
UNDP demonstrated its full support to the implementation of the New Urban Agenda with the official launch of its Sustainable Urbanization Strategy.
The Plan recognizes that rapid urbanization and changing demographic patterns are challenging conventional thinking on development pathways and that addressing urban challenges requires cross-cutting, integrated applications of expertise and investment, customized for each country and circumstance and driven by global best practices and international standards.

Asian football  body signs major  marketing deal
Kuala Lumpur, Tuesday: Asia's football body has signed a major commercial rights deal with sports marketing agency DDMC Fortis aimed at securing the financial future of the game in the region for the coming years.
The deal gives the agency, a joint venture between Chinese and Swiss groups, exclusive rights from 2021 to 2028 starting with the final qualifying round of the 2022 World Cup, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) said in a statement.
The AFC did not say how much the agreement was worth but reports put it at $3.4 billion, a huge boost for the rapidly growing football scene in Asia.
"This is a most significant day in the history of the AFC," the body's president Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa said as the deal was signed Monday in Kuala Lumpur, where the AFC is based.
"With the signing of this contract, the AFC can guarantee its member associations that the game in Asia has tremendously solid financial foundations from which to build."
DDMC Fortis CEO, Patrick Murphy, said that the group "strongly feel that, in cooperation with the AFC, we are in a position to transform the way Asian football is organised, enjoyed and commercialised across Asia".
DDMC Fortis is a joint venture between Swiss group Fortis Sports and China's DDMC Sports International. The new deal signals an end to a long-running commercial partnership between the AFC and Lagardere Sports and Entertainment.
The announcement came ahead of an AFC congress Wednesday in Kuala Lumpur, in which Sheikh Salman will be seeking support for a re-election bid next year.
The Bahraini royal first took the reins in 2013 when the AFC was still reeling from a corruption scandal which saw his predecessor, Mohamed bin Hammam, banned from football for life.
At the AFC Congress next April, Sheikh Salman could face a challenge from Saudi Arabia's Adel Ezzat, head of a new regional bloc, the South West Asian Football Federation.
Delegates arriving ahead of this week's meeting voiced support for the Bahraini. Anura De Silva, president of the Football Federation of Sri Lanka, said that Sheikh Salman's position looked solid.
"Sponsorship is booming under his leadership," he told AFP.
"The increase in sponsorship reflects his credibility and he is transparent in his job." AFP

Ball-tampering: Why it cut Australian cricket so deep
MELBOURNE, Monday: The Australian cricket team was once held in such high esteem that former prime minister John Howard joked he held only the second most important leadership role in the land, after the national Test captain.
But the sandpaper-gate scandal has changed perceptions of the men in the famous baggy green cap, perhaps irrevocably, while the image of governing body Cricket Australia has also been seriously tarnished.
The controversy erupted when batsman Cameron Bancroft was caught trying to alter the ball using sandpaper in the third Test at Newlands in South Africa.
To the outside observer, the affair may have seemed more farcical than shocking.
Bancroft infamously hid the sandpaper down his trousers when television cameras caught him scuffing the surface of the ball, and then captain Steve Smiths evasive answers at a press conference dragged his team further into the mire.
Smith, Bancroft and fellow conspirator David Warner initially thought the fuss would blow over quickly. After all, the punishment for ball-tampering was only a one-match suspension.
Plenty of high-profile international cricketers had received minor punishments and escaped with their reputations intact after being found guilty of the same offence.
The list includes Englands Mike Atherton, Shahid Afridi of Pakistan and current South African skipper Faf du Plessis (twice).
But public reaction to the Australians behaviour was furious, Smith was stripped of the captaincy and all three players received lengthy bans.
The scandal also cut a swathe through Cricket Australia management, with Sutherland, coach Darren Lehmann and team performance boss Pat Howard all heading for the exits amid claims they fostered a toxic team culture.
HEADBUTT THE LINE
To understand why the backlash was so extreme, it helps to bear ex-prime minister Howards observation in mind.
And as ABCs national sports correspondent Mary Gearin pointed out when the scandal broke, Australias cricketers enjoy a unique place in the affections of their fans.
The national mens cricket team has had a century and a half of brand dominance, she wrote.
Our team, like it or not, resides right near the heart of our national identity, and allowed a space in our psyche that absolutely no other team, or entity, enjoys.
For decades, the Australian Test side has adopted a prickly, uncompromising demeanour on the field that former captain Steve Waugh said was intended to bring about the mental disintegration of opponents.
Rival fans accused the Australians of being boorish and insulting, with even some of their own supporters uncomfortable with their antics.
But players defended themselves, insisting they played hard but fair.
Theres a line. Well headbutt the line but we wont go over it, spinner Nathan Lyon said last year.
The ball-tampering scandal not only crossed the line but obliterated it, leaving the national teams reputation in tatters.
Waugh said there was genuine shock among Australians that their team would resort to cheating.
Fairfax cricket writer Jon Pierek said in the wake of the scandal that the Australian public were clamouring for their cricketers to drop the ugly behaviour and transform into players they could once again adore. This is the moment Australian cricket must shed its bully-boy reputation and a win-at-all costs attitude that has ripped the game apart, he said.
In an effort to meet those demands, Cricket Australia commissioned an independent review of its culture and practices.
The review was released on Monday and it was scathing of the sports governing body, labelling it arrogant and controlling in a quest to win at all costs. AFP

## Title: Bank Credit:  Bank Business or  National Money
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

Bank Credit:  Bank Business or  National Money
Banking is synonymous with deposit-taking and lending (credit) for profit. They take deposits by paying interest and lend deposits by charging interest. The difference between interest charged and interest paid is the net income available to cover all operational expenses and a profit margin to bank owners. Therefore, bank credit is a risky business although we think that banks enjoy a ready-made profit to stay in marbled buildings. Deposits also are credit we grant to banks by taking risks as there is no risk-free business in this world.
In economics, currency is first stage of money. Banks deposits and credit that arise from currency are the two sides of the coin that create money. Bank credit is financed by deposits. Proceeds of credit again become deposits and the continuing turnover between credit and deposits creates money. As such, bank deposits constitute the major part of money held by the public (i.e., 93.2% of Broad Money M2). Therefore, bank credit is both business and national money. As the amount of money in the economy has to be guarded for its value and safety to be consistent with the requirements of the real economy and its potential, banking is immensely regulated by the monetary policy and prudential regulation. Therefore, when we deal with banks for deposits or borrowing, we have to be patient as bank-hands are tightly tied by both themselves and regulators for the safety of everybodys money. This does not mean that the bad never happens. See Graphic
Given the technicality and complexity of the subject, this article covers only how banks mange credit in their business.
Economic Role of Credit
Economies are essentially credit societies with credit instruments ranging from currency to various debt instruments. Currencies are promissory notes to repay their face value by the government. Bank credit is a promissory note signed by the borrower agreeing to repay to the lending bank. Credit market and bank credit are the two layers of credit delivery. In credit markets, credits instruments are designed, priced, issued and re-traded openly. Large corporates and governments with publicly assessed credit-worthiness borrow in the market. Bank credit is the dominant layer of credit in the world while the most part of credit markets also is funded by bank credit.
The intermediation, i.e., banks borrow as own liabilities and lend as own assets, is the bank credit mechanism. Borrowings are mostly short-term and liquid. Deposits (major borrowing) are repayable on demand. Banks pool these savings and lend short-term, medium and long term to finance economic activities, consumption, production, trade etc. Therefore, banks pool and re-distribute both credit and underlying credit risk across the economy as a business which fuels the economy. Nobody can live without credit.
Bank Credit Products and Profit
Banks offer credit products to suit financial needs of the economy, both retail (households and small businesses) and wholesale (large corporate and governments). Overdrafts, corporate credit, business credit, export and import credit, mortgages, micro, small and medium industry finance, agriculture and pawning are some categories. Financial guarantees and credit lines are unfunded credit products offered on fees to facilitate transactions.
Bank balance sheets (assets and liabilities) are generally 90% credit on both sides. Only nearly 10% is capital used for risk-absorption, fixed assets and technology for bank operations. The interest margin (net interest income) is the cost of intermediation to the economy. The margin should be high enough to cover risks of credit, bank operational cost and a return to bank owners/capital, but low enough to reduce the transactions cost to the economy. The lower the margin, greater the efficiency in intermediation. Banking technology, financial literacy and inclusion and credit ecosystem help lower the intermediation cost through better credit discipline and lower cost structure. Therefore, the most single indicator to assess bank efficiency is the interest margin that varies across banks due to differences in their cost and risk structures.
Bank Risks on Credit
As bank operations and balance sheets are credit-based, bank risk profiles also are largely credit-based. Any credit is necessarily risky as it has to be recovered in uncertain future. The credit or default risk is the possible non-repayment of credit with interest as due. The liquidity risk is the cash-flow difficulties to make routine payments, deposit withdrawals, loan disbursements, etc. The liquidity risk is inherent in intermediation due to the tenure mismatch in deposits and credit as longer-term credit (illiquid assets) is funded by short-term deposits (liquid liabilities). Various operational risks also arise from weaknesses in credit delivery and deposit-taking systems. Therefore, banks have to charge a sufficient premium from borrowers to cover all such measured risks that vary across banks due to their different risk profiles.
Credit Risk Management
Bank management is necessarily the credit risk management, given the significance and magnitude of credit portfolio for bank sustainability. Credit losses reduce bank income and assets. If the loss is high year after year, bank capital gets eroded and its solvency is threatened. Unmanaged credit risk is the cause of many problem banks and failed banks around the world.
Therefore, banks must have a well-managed credit delivery system to ensure that suitable credit products are offered, each borrower is assessed to be a good risk and all precautions are in place to cover all possible credit risks. A bank cannot just lend as and when customers request. That is why borrowers confront delays and difficulties when borrowing from banks.
Bank risk-focused credit delivery system contains several layers, a few of which are highlighted below.
1) Bank Credit Policy
This covers credit products, terms of conditions and internal controls. Banks have to do market surveys and design credit products to gain a market share within its capital base/size. Credit evaluation process, internal controls on approvals and credit administration including credit follow-ups and recoveries also are key parts of the credit policy.
2) Credit Evaluation  6Cs
Banks should lend only if the borrower is fully trustworthy to borrow and payback. Bank credit literature contains 6Cs of borrower/credit evaluation. They are Capacity, Capital, Collateral, Conditions, Character and Confidence, that each borrower has to pass.
Capacity is the borrowers economic hygiene such as cash-flow stability and established business profile. Capital is the borrowers contribution to the activity to be financed by credit. Collateral covers external securities such as property and sureties that the borrower has to provide as safeguards to banks in the event the loan goes sour. Condition is the general economic environment and borrowers business industry. Character is the personal profile of the borrower. Confidence is the trust the borrower creates in the bank by satisfying other five Cs. Although 6Cs have been evolved from business/corporate customers, it is equally applicable to all borrowers, but at different strengths.
Banks have developed internal credit rating/scoring systems covering various data items under each C to test individual borrowers. Therefore, prospective borrowers have to satisfy their banks with necessary information to pass the 6Cs based-evaluation test. Borrowers treated outside the above test, e.g., related-party lending, invariably end up as sour risks.
3) Non-performing Loans (NPL) Monitoring
Loans that become arrears against the repayment plan are NPL. In general, banks wait for 3 monthly installments or 90 days in arrears of the due repayment to classify loans as NPL, inclusive of all loans of respective borrowers. To be more prudent, one installment or 30 days in arrears are adequate to detect early warnings of sour loans. Borrowers confronting repayment problems even if repayment is in order are classified as NPL for better monitoring. No further loans should be granted to keep loans performing (ever-greening). In rescheduling of NPL, rescheduled loans should continue to be in NPL category at least one year to re-test the borrower.
The NPL classification helps banks in two ways. First, banks can keep a close follow up/extra caution on doubtful borrowers. Second, banks can assess and monitor the banks overall perceived credit risk estimated as the ratio (%) of NPL to total loan book. The NPL ratio is a test on the efficiency of bank credit evaluation system. Given the real-world uncertainties, an NPL ratio of 1% to 2% may be manageable but alarming. A 2% of NPL ratio means that the bank capital ratio, if 10% of assets, is effectively around 8%.
Banks must not take interest receivable/accrued on NPL into income and loans/assets to avoid over-statement of profit and loan book. It should be kept in suspense account until interest is recovered in cash.
4) Loan Loss Provisioning/Impairment
In general, banks further classify NPL to identify bad and doubtful NPL and allocate funds out of bank income regularly to cover those NPL losses. Loans in arears in 6-12 installments (doubtful loans) and more than 12 installments (loss loans) are allocated with specific provisions such as 50% and 100%, respectively, on the outstanding loan net of interest in suspense and the realizable value of underlying collaterals. However, more prudent banks identify all borrowers with bad track-record as doubtful and make provisions. A general provision at least 1% of total performing loan base is also prudent to keep an additional cushion to cover general credit risk. Otherwise, bank profit is over-stated and used for payment of bonuses and dividends while the bank bottom line is weak. Such provisions can be written back to income when NPL are recovered or set-off without a threat to solvency when NPL become losses.
Banks also can compute Net NPL ratio, net of specific provisions and interest in suspense, to monitor the actual bank exposure to NPL. If the net NPL ratio is 0.5%, it can be easily written off to clean up bank books, pending realization of collaterals.
5) Collateral Valuation
Value of credit collaterals such as property, equities and debt securities fluctuate in markets. Bursts of asset bubbles from time to time erode asset collateral values and foreclosures. Therefore, banks must regularly value collaterals based on average trend values to estimate their recovery values. Otherwise, loan loss provisions may be under-stated. Further, collateral values should be discounted to calculate provisions as the recovery of total collateral value is quite problematic.
6) Control of Credit Concentrations
Excessive concentrations of credit in certain big customers, volatile sectors/industries and asset markets must be controlled in proportion to bank capital and total loan book in order to avoid excessive dependence because such concentrations are risky and contagious across banks. In western markets, bank exposures to asset markets have been the cause for almost all banking crises when asset bubbles burst. Periodical bursts of asset bubbles funded by bank credit hit banks twice, first, default of credit granted for asset purchases and second, erosion of asset collaterals on existing credit.
Sri Lankan banks experienced a burst of world gold bubble in 2013 causing a significant rise of pawning NPL from 0.8% to 13% and a fall of pawning portfolio to a half (i.e., pawning declined to 8% from 23% of total loan book). Banks have to adopt conventional loan-to-value ratios (LTV) based on trend average value of assets/collaterals to reduce the excessive exposure to asset markets. Therefore, a largely diversified loan book with prudent LTV helps bank sustainability although it may affect bank profitability.
7) Control of Maturity Mismatch
Banks generally classify their assets and liabilities in different time/maturity buckets based on their remaining maturity periods such as less than one month, 1-2 months and 3-4 months in rising order and manage portfolios in each time-bucket to keep the negative assets-liabilities mismatch cumulative up to a short period, e.g., 3 or 6 months, at a low rate of total balance sheet (i.e., 10%). This helps to reduce fundamental liquidity problems. Accordingly, cash-flows can be managed to iron out routine daily mismatches.
8) Beware of Structured Credit Products
During the last three decades, western financial markets underwent a considerable rate of financial engineering to invent innovative credit products such as securitization, asset-backed securities and credit-default-swaps (CDS) to trade bank credit in the market. Therefore, banks started selling their credit portfolios to investment banks who repackaged them, sliced them into marketable bonds with external credit ratings and issued bonds in the market for trade among investors. CDS (credit insurance products) were structured to trade credit risks underlying such bonds in the market.
As a result, banks gave up conventional relationship-based retail banking and credit evaluation. Instead, banks borrowed heavily from money markets to lend. Unevaluated loans and sell-off such loan books to investment banks, mostly owned and supported by banks with warehouse credit lines, were bank routines to take credit risk out of bank books. This resulted in excessive leverage, subprime lending (liars ledger) and heavy exposures to asset markets. Some banks heavily invested and traded in such structured products. This innovative credit risk management strategies opened up banks to both market risk and liquidity risk excessively in place of the sold-credit risk and largely contributed to the last global financial crisis 2007/09.
These innovative products prevail in markets. Therefore, banks should be extra cautious if they go after such innovative products, despite banking is essentially relationship-based retail lending and deposit-taking.
9) Capital Charge for Credit Risk
Banks generally estimate credit risk ratings (weights) for various loan categories and calculate bank capital required to cover estimated risks. For example, risk rates of 0% for government loans, 20% for high rated corporates, 35% for residential housing loans and 100% for commercial property loans can be applied to calculate minimum capital, i.e., 12% of risks, required to cushion credit risk. This means that credit risk not covered by capital is 88% which has to be managed by banks externally. Capital charge helps banks to build up capital without waiting until credit risks actually hit causing bankruptcies. Banks can economize capital by cleaning up high risk-rated loans.
10) Control of Leverage
Banks are highly leveraged (rate of assets over bank capital) as they grow excessively on borrowed funds with less capital. All bank problems and crises are connected with excessive leverage. Therefore, banks should control their balance sheet growth by monitoring the leverage at a sustainable level (i.e., 10 or less) by building up capital. The risk-based capital (i.e., Basel Capital Standard) is one of leverage restraints.
Tracking the credit-to-deposits ratio (CDR) at around 70% is a conventional measure to keep the credit expansion/leverage as well as bank liquidity within the control. If the CDR is 110%, the bank has lent all deposits and an additional 10% from market borrowing which is risky. A CDR is 70% means that 30% of deposits are in liquid assets which is a prudential safeguard.
11) Data Warehousing and Mining
Banks must use modern IT to have all borrower information, both current and past (at least 10 years) in a data base environment to analyze portfolio characteristics by types of business, purpose, borrower-status (sex, age, corporate, retail, etc.), geographic location, economic shocks, loan size, etc. Such information can be used to estimate credit risk ratings across identified categories. The best practice is to apply these risk ratings for prospective borrowers in similar categories at the time of credit evaluation. For example, if the loss rate on retail trade credit to young borrowers in middle income is 2%, there is no harm in applying a 2% risk rate in credit evaluation of all new borrowers in this category.
12) Credit Ecosystem
Bank regulation and supervision, loan recovery laws, credit information bureau, external credit raters, external auditors and external valuers cover the ecosystem that promotes the credit culture and discipline of both banks and borrowers and provides a guarded pitch to take prudent risks. The system has immensely helped credit risk management as reflected from the significant reduction of banking sector net NPL ratio (net of interest in suspense) from 14.7% in 1998 to 2.5% in 2017.
As both credit and deposits are inter-related in banking businesses with risks, banks and customers may look at the NPL ratio along with other prudential ratios of individual banks published in their quarterly financial disclosures to assess differences in risks on both sides of bank balance sheets. However, such statistics involve in complex accounting definitions and judgements that general public will never grasp. Therefore, banks need to distribute customer-hand books in a common format approved by the regulator to educate the public for better discipline among both customers and bank staff on banking business and its hygiene.
Accordingly, all bank depositors and borrowers need to understand the environment in which banks operate to serve them with prudential safeguards.

Today is World Cities Day
Better City,  Better Life
The city is where most of us live and work. The city today is home to much of humanity. In recognition of the Citys special place in our lives, the United Nations has designated today (October 31) as World Cities Day.
The general theme of World Cities Day is Better City, Better Life, while each year a different sub-theme is selected, to either promote successes of urbanization, or address specific challenges resulting from urbanization. This year, the United Nations has selected the theme Building Sustainable and Resilient Cities because cities need support to become resilient and develop their capacity to absorb the impact of hazards, protect and preserve human life and limit damage and destruction of public and private assets while continuing to provide infrastructure and services after a crisis.
Every week, 1.4 million people around the world move to cities in addition to the transient population on working days. Such rapid urbanization can strain local capacities, contributing to increased risk from natural and human made disasters. But hazards do not need to become disasters. The answer is to build resilience -- to storms, floods, earthquakes, fires, pandemics and economic crises.
City planners
Cities around the world are already acting to increase resilience and sustainability. Bangkok has built vast underground water storage facilities to cope with increased flood risk and save water for drier periods. In Quito, the local government has reclaimed or protected more than 200,000 hectares of land to boost flood protection, reduce erosion and safeguard the citys freshwater supply and biodiversity. And in Johannesburg, the city is involving residents in efforts to improve public spaces so they can be safely used for recreation, sports, community events and services such as free medical care. Cape Town has an aggressive programme to conserve water. Colombo too has an ongoing flood mitigation programme.
More than half of all people live in cities and planned human settlements, and that proportion is projected to grow to two thirds by 2050 when the world population will reach nine billion from todays seven billion. Urban areas already are hubs of energy, innovation and economic dynamism. Using these factors as a template, city planners must design cities for the future with resilience in mind.
There is already buzzword for future cities  they will be smart cities where everything and everyone will be connected via the Internet of Things (IoT) concept, although many experts have raised security and privacy concerns. In fact, a recent report issued in the USA predicted that Cities around the world could spend as much as US$ 41 trillion on smart technology over the next 20 years. The market for smart city technology is predicted to reach US$ 760 billion in just four years.
Traffic snarls will be a thing of the past with driverless cars that can communicate with road signals and with each other. With cities becoming virtually collision free, there will be massive savings in terms of insurance and health costs. There will also be no need to own a car when you can call up a driverless car at any time  which will also obviate the need for most parking spaces which can then be used for other purposes.
Energy will be supplied mostly or only by renewable sources. New power grids will use two-way communication between the utility and customers to make more efficient use of energy. All waste materials will be recycled via solar-powered trash compactors. Most people will be able to work from home via always-on connectivity, which will further reduce the need for personal transport.
It is clear that the public sector alone will not be able to accomplish all these, which will cost billions of dollars in the long run. There is a clear case here for Public-Private Partnerships. The authorities should form a broad network of stakeholders to turn our key cities to smart cities.
Colombo is seeing a rapid transformation and will look much different in just four or five years  scores of high rise buildings are coming up, new flyovers are taking shape and unseen aspects such as sanitation are getting as makeover. Colombo is already home to nearly one million permanent and transiting residents and the figures will go higher as rural to urban migration continues.
The city is the pivot on which the economy revolves and in Colombos case, it is responsible for a good part of the countrys economic performance. But for all its importance, Colombo has basically been an unplanned city with ad-hoc developments that had not taken future population and other projections into account. Now we have an opportunity to correct these mistakes and build back better so that the entire city populace will benefit.
Planned urbanization maximizes the capacity of cities to generate employment and wealth, and to foster diversity and social cohesion between different classes, cultures, ethnicities and religions. Cities designed to live together create opportunities, enable connection and interaction, and facilitate sustainable use of shared resources. Local urban planners have now taken these concerns on board not only in the case of Colombo, but also for Kandy, Trincomalee, Jaffna and Galle among others.
Key initiatives
It is a vision for cities that are safe, accessible, affordable, resilient and sustainable, which is just what we want to see in a city such as Colombo. City planners worldwide will also have to address problems such as crime, drugs, pollution and poverty which have taken their toll on hundreds of millions of city-dwellers.
Over the next few decades, urbanization will be driven by several key initiatives - the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Agenda for Humanity, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
The term Anthropocene has been used to describe the times we live in because it is an era indelibly shaped by human activity. The Anthropocene is fundamentally marked by urbanization. Data from the World Bank shows that in 2017, 54.7% of the worlds population  4.1 billion people  lived in urban areas.
Asia is home to many of the worlds mea cities. The Beijing- Tianjin- Qinhuangdao corridor has a population of over 100 million. In the future, there will be a sprawl of mega urban centres from Beijing to Bangkok to Jakarta to Mumbai. Although cities across Asia are growing apace, only three (Singapore, Tokyo, and Kobe) are in the top 50 of the Mercer Quality of Life index. Singapore offers the best quality of life of all Asian cities, according to the Survey. Colombo is the highest ranked South Asian city, but still occupies only the 137th place out of 231 cities. At least 15 Asian cities are in the bottom 50 of this ranking. The challenge before Asian leaders is to make these Asian cities livable for the present and the future.
Cities face a myriad of challenges from overpopulation to traffic, but all these problems have answers and solutions. City planners and Government authorities must work together to resolve the problems and present viable solutions. Sustainability is the keyword as cities brace for the future. If we fail to address these dire problems right now, the future will be bleak for the next generations. Our cities deserve a better deal with an eye on the future.

China says no interference in internal affairs in SL
Colombo, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) - The Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka dismissed allegations made by an MP claiming that China was funding certain parliamentarians amid current political crisis.
In a statement released on Monday, the embassy said such allegations were groundless and irresponsible. As a friendly neighbour, China is paying close attention to the situation change in Sri Lanka, the embassy said.
It is a matter of internal affairs and China has consistently supported the principle of non-interference in other countrys internal affairs. We believe that the Sri Lankan government, parties and people have the wits and ways needed to deal with the current situation, it added.
Wickremesinghe has called the move illegal and called on Parliament Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to summon the parliament immediately so he could prove his majority.
President Sirisena has suspended parliament till November 16.

Maintain discipline in universities
According to newspaper reports, police have arrested 16 undergraduates who had been forcefully occupying the administrative block of the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka. These students are now in police custody.
The university has been made out bounds for the 16 undergraduates and students from the Faculty of Technology had staged a protest demanding that their fellow undergraduates be taken back without any conditions.
A group of students was subjected to the disciplinary inquiry over ragging several students in the university.
After the inquiry, the University Grants Commission UGC has decided to dismiss the studentship of four students in the Technology Faculty.
Discipline in universities has become a big problem. These students are given all the facilities free of charge. Tax payers are paying for their education.
Most of the tax payers in Sri Lanka are poor people. Some of them are living without any facilities. The university students are provided with all the facilities.
Go to a school in a village and see the facilities available. They do not have proper school buildings, proper classrooms, proper washrooms, proper canteen, proper library, required number of teachers.
However, the university students are provided with all these facilities free of charge. Tax payers are paying for their education.
In the case of private universities, parents are paying for their education. Sometimes several lakhs of rupees per year.
We should not allow these few indisciplined students to ruin the higher education of Sri Lanka.
We studied in the Peradeniya University about 40 years back. We also had problems. We never misbehaved like this. We respected our university teachers. We did not cut lectures. We did our practicals very well. We used the library facilities. Some of us were provided facilities to stay in halls. Some others were boarded in houses outside the university. We had financial problems. We had language problems. We had to repeat examinations. But we did not fight with the university management. There was discipline in universities.
We very kindly request the government and the university authorities to do everything possible to maintain discipline in universities. There are very few trouble creators, may be less than five percent. Please do not allow these trouble creators to ruin the university education of thousand others.
University administrators should be very firm. They should not get scared of students. They must do the right thing. Once a decision is taken, it should never be changed. All this is done for the benefit of the students, for the benefit of free education, for the benefit of our country.
University is not a place for some rude or mad students to come and play the fool.
It is a place to produce intellectuals to our society. Government, university teachers, university administrators and all other relevant parties should do their part to maintain discipline in universities. Forty years back we had that discipline. Let us re-establish it again.

The Supreme Court ruled Nasheed could not be detained by police or prison authorities until his appeal against his controversial 13 year jail sentence for terrorism is heard.
Nasheed was branded a fugitive from justice when he went into exile in 2016 after seeking medical treatment abroad. He risked arrest if he ever returned to the Maldives under President Abdulla Yameen, who jailed or exiled most of his opponents. But he suffered a surprise defeat last month and vacates the top job on November 17. - AFP

## Title: Dance devoted to Yakshagana
## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C
## Date: Wednesday, October 31, 2018 - 01:00
Dance devoted to Yakshagana
One of the classical dance forms based on the Karnataka State of India is called Yakshagana. It is an admixture of folk and classical dance forms of India. In Karnataka, the dance form was called by different names. The northern part of Karnataka called it Doddaata. It is said that in Mysore it was known as Moodalapaya. But later it was refined and called Yakshagana.
Another folk dance was called Yakshagana Bombeyaata. (It was a puppet show). Yakshagana can be considered as a classical dance form of Karnataka.
Important elements
It is a drama based dance form. And almost it is similar to the Bhagavatha Mela dance drama of Tamil Nadu. Like most of the other Indian classical dance forms, this Yakshagana is also deeply rooted in the Hindu religious epics, but it was mostly cherished by the Vaishnava cult. It is based on four important elements such as dance, drama, music and dialogue. Most of the themes reveal the dharma doctrine by showing the struggle between good and evil. In the end, the triumph of good over the evil is well depicted.
The music is provided by professional musicians known as Bhagavathars who use two main instruments. One is a Maddale and another is Chande. But Chande is not always used, except for certain scenes and circumstances. The Maddale is a drum. The dance drama is based on certain stories generally called Prasangas which were written during the 17th century and thereafter.
The ragas selected for the dances must suit and reflect the different emotional moods of the scenes. For instance, certain ragas such as Thodi, Mohanam and Savari ragas are used to portray sorrow. The style of singing is entirely different in Yakshagana. The language of the music is in the Kannada language.
Rhythmic tempos
The instrument Chande is used only for certain scenes such as violence, war and terror. Among all the scenes, the most enjoyable is from Mahabaratha and Ramayana. Different emotions are exhibited through a variety of footwork and Gathi Petha (different rhythmic tempos). The important characters are introduced to the audience which is called Voddolagas. The characters dance and enter the stage with a variety of hand gestures (Muthras) and footwork (steps) with different beats. Generally introducing the male characters to the audience is common in most of the folk-based ritual dances. The stage where the performances take place is called Rangasala which is installed in the temple grounds. And it is a temporary shed built with bamboo poles and decorated with fresh mango leaves.
Like ancient folk dances, classical dances and dramas of olden days Yakshagana were also staged throughout the nights. Like all others Indian classical dances and folk dances, Yakshagana is also based on the Natya Sastra. Therefore, it has a lot of similarities, resemblance, links and relationships, with other Indian dance forms. Especially, it resembles the stances, jumps, vigorous movements, make-ups, dressing and subtle graceful facial expressions of Keralas State dance Kathakali and the folk dance of Tamil Nadu known as Therukoothu. Like Kuchupidi and Bhagavathamela in between the dances, the dialogue takes place. As in many ancient Indian classical dance forms, the female characters are played by the males alone. A variety of hand gestures (muthras) which are common in Bharatha Natyam, Kuchupidi and Kathakali are used in Yakshagana. For instance, Pathaakam, Mirugashirusam, Kadakamugam, Musti are some of the hand gestures used in this dance form. Thandava and Lassiya the two different important concepts of oriental dance forms are equally used in the dance drama. It provides enough and equal opportunities to use the Angika Abinaya, Akariya Abhinaya, Vachika Abinaya and Saathvika Abhinaya. Each character has a distinct type of make-up. When the characters do their allocated roles through Angas (limbs or organs) it is considered as Angika Abinaya.
Variety of ornaments
Different types of dresses, headgears, colourful turbans, beautiful crowns, kiridam and chest kavasams, shoulder kavasams, and rich glittering grand dresses, a variety of ornaments, are especially worn by the participants in the form of Akaraiya Abinaya (dressing) of Yakshagana. Often the decorations and dresses resemble the Kathakali dancers.
The interpretation of the songs through dialogue in between the songs, or when they dance for the Bagavathars songs, by interpreting through Abhinaya could be considered Vachika Abhinaya (Oral interpretation). When the characters perform their roles with full emotional involvement, it can be regarded as Sathvika Abhinaya (Abhinaya with emotional interpretation).
Yakshagana ends with Mangalam as other classical dance forms of South India. The dance drama ends before sunrise. As other classical dance forms, Yakshagana is also subjected to innovations. Yet, many traditional professional artists, gurus and art lovers, want to maintain the pristine purity of the art.

Dead Brazilian footballer almost decapitated
SAO PAULO, Monday: Brazilian football was in shock on Monday after authorities announced the death of 24-year-old midfielder Daniel Correa, who was found almost decapitated with his genitals cut off.
His parent club, Sao Paulo FC, whom he joined in 2015, paid tribute to Correa with its players holding a minutes silence before training on Monday.
Correa had been on loan at second division Sao Bento when he died.
Sao Paulo said in a statement that he was found dead this weekend. Other Brazilian clubs and players also paid tribute.
Police in the southern Parana state said Correas body had been found in a rural zone on the outskirts of the state capital Curitiba on Saturday.
Authorities said an investigation into his death was advanced and that members of his family would be interviewed.
A police source told Folha de S.Paulo newspaper that Correas throat had been slit with a blade so wide that his head was almost entirely cut off. His genitals had also been severed.
Brazil is one of the most violent countries in the world where last year a record 63,880 people were murdered, some 30.8 per 100,000.
The United Nations considers a murder rate greater than 10 per 100,000 citizens as the threshold for endemic violence.
Once a prospect at Brazilian giants Cruzeiro, the powerhouse club from his home state of Minas Gerais, Correa made his professional debut at Rio de Janeiro outfit Botafogo in 2013, alongside Dutch great Clarence Seedorf.
With a talent for dribbling, fans dubbed him Daniel Messi.
But a serious knee injury in 2014 curtailed his progress and Correa was never able to fulfil his early promise.  AFP

Earths wild animal population plummets
FRANCE: Runaway consumption has decimated global wildlife, triggered a mass extinction and exhausted Earths capacity to accommodate humanitys expanding appetites, the global conservation group WWF warned Tuesday.
From 1970 to 2014, 60 percent of all animals with a backbone -- fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles and mammals -- were wiped out by human appetites and activity, according WWFs Living Planet report, based on a survey of more than 4,000 species spread over 16,700 populations scattered across the globe.
The situation is really bad, and it keeps getting worse, WWF International Director General Marco Lambertini told AFP. The only good news is that we know exactly what is happening. 
The only good news is that we know exactly what is happening. For freshwater fauna, the decline in population over the 44 years monitored was a staggering 80 percent. Regionally, Latin America was hit hardest, seeing a nearly 90 percent loss of wildlife over the same period. Another dataset confirmed the depth of an unfolding mass extinction event, only the sixth in the last half-billion years.
Depending on which of Earths lifeforms are included, the current rate of species loss is 100 to 1,000 times higher than only a few hundred years ago, when people began to alter Earths chemistry and crowd other creatures out of existence. Measured by weight, or biomass, wild animals today only account for four percent of mammals on Earth, with humans (36 percent) and livestock (60 percent) making up the rest.
Ten thousand years ago that ratio was probably reversed.
The statistics are scary, said Piero Visconti, a researcher at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria and one of 59 co-authors of the 80-page report. Unlike population declines, extinctions are irreversible. For corals, it may already be too late.
Back-to-back marine heatwaves have already wiped out up to half of the globes shallow-water reefs, which support a quarter of all marine life.
Even if humanity manages to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) -- mission impossible, according to some scientists -- coral mortality will likely be 70 to 90 percent.
A 2C world would be a death sentence, a major UN report concluded last month.
Half-a-century of conservation efforts have scored spectacular successes, with significant recoveries among tigers, manatees, grizzly bears, bluefin tuna and bald eagles.
If we didnt make those efforts, the situation would have been much worse, Lambertini said.
But the onslaught of hunting, shrinking habitat, pollution, illegal trade and climate change -- all caused by humans -- has been too much to overcome, he acknowledged.
Scientists call it the great acceleration, he said in a phone interview. - AFP

"We are exercising vigilance and avoiding all demonstrations or large political gatherings," England spokesman Danny Reuben told AFP.
"We are aware of a political demonstration today, but for us it is all about preparations for the first Test."
Reuben said a four-day practice match in Colombo would go ahead as planned, despite the troubles in the capital.
England take on Sri Lanka in the first Test at Galle, in the south of the country, on November 6. England are due to stay in Sri Lanka until November 27 when the third Test ends. The dispute between sacked prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Rajapakse has already hit Sri Lanka's cricket establishment.
On Sunday, bodyguards for Petroleum Minister Arjuna Ranatunga, Sri Lanka's captain when they won the 1996 World Cup, opened fire at a crowd as they moved to rescue him from Rajapakse supporters. One man was killed and two others were wounded. Ranatunga was arrested Monday on an allegation of ordering the shooting, but was released on bail. AFP

Exploring  the human soul
Soulscapes by Dillai Joseph, an art exhibition that explores the human soul in its barest form was held recently at Lionel Wendt Art Gallery.
Dillai Joseph is a self-taught artist who later honed her skills under the tutelage of Nadine David. The latter was a student of David Paynter. The innermost desires, awakened feelings, beastly hungers and dormant daydreams find their place on canvas in her portrayal of the 'I' within every woman. Her work speaks of an aim to provoke a sense of exploration of oneself; she looks at the deep nature of the woman within, beyond a body of just flesh and skin.

Former PM's rejection of President's decision leads country to tense situation - FNO
The Federation of National Organisations (FNO), in a statement issued on November 29, said a tense situation is building in the country owning to the former Prime Ministers rejection of the constitutional decision made by President Maithripala Sirisena.
Therefore, the FNO requested President Sirisena to declare a state of emergency to prevent this tense situation from leading to clashes.
The statement signed by the FNOs convenor Dr. Gunadasa Amarasekera said the relevant political party had the democratic right to withdraw from a national government.
Such a political decision will abolish the national government and the Cabinet, according to Section 46 (2) of the Constitution.
The statement said that in this situation, the President had two options. One is to reappoint Ranil Wickrmesinghe as Prime Minister again if he can command a majority in Parliament.
If that is not possible, the President can appoint another parliamentarian whom he thinks can gain a majority as the Prime Minister.
No one believed that the former Prime Minister, who has a long experience cannot understand such a simple provision in the Constitution. Similarly, if the former Prime Minister can muster majority support in Parliament, he could do so when Parliament meets on November 16 or nearby date.
Apart from this, the Attorney General too had endorsed the decision made by President Sirisena as constitutional and legal.
The challenging of the Presidents constitutional decision has caused a constitutional crisis which may lead to clashes among parties resulting even in a civil disturbance.
This situation was building up at a time when an alleged conspiracy to assassinate the President and disrupt national security.
Therefore, the President is bound by the Constitution to prevent such a situation from arising.

FUTURE MINDS ON WILDLIFE
Great: and they are in safe hands judging what I saw they had put on their canvases not concentrating on their artistic skills but focused in what they had in their young minds. Hundreds of children from Grade 9 upwards from around the country were given the opportunity to meet, discuss ways and means how they could make a positive contribution to save wildlife and conserve the echo system to save the green pastures and waterways to sustain wildlife.
The ideas were varied and significant and to bring out their talent.
came in a big way with their members helping the young artists, encouraging them to express their young ideas.
Elephant was given the priority by most children, they had captured the harrowing, heart-rendering trauma the animals have gone through the moment the night train ran over them at Habarans.
Many had recorded the tragic incident where five elephants were brutally killed and among them one mother whose baby-fetus snatched away even before it was born by the rolling wheels and lay dead next to its mother.
There were other paintings of the jumbo in lighter vein, many in their herds roaming in their lush environment.
One or two were depicted killed, by guns and traps laid. It was hearkening to note how young generation knew what was happening in the wilds and it crossed my mind that they will be better guardians of nature and her wilds than today's generation.
One little artist said no even to perahara elephants while another abhorred them being looked like exhibits, these awesome animals. Their dignity and majesty well inculcated in all young minds.
Moving away from the subject of elephants, the big cat took the pride of place. Atop trees, playing hide and seek for their prey or frolicking among their young cubs. Here again, one or two young artists brought out the torture inflicted on the big cat unbelievable with great pain, invading into their territory with guns and traps to destroy nature's glory.
The minds were young and tender but the concern mature. They showed the elders how to respect each and every species in their own terms. Some also sent the message to the temples and all who held elephants in captivity in heavy chains, making them work hard, pulling and piling logs. One youngster poured her heart out on an innocent dead bear, killed for no reason. Others painted big cats and tigers caged in the zoo looking at the world from within iron bars plucked away from their natural homes and held in captivity.
Most cats were looking on with tears pouring down. I thought some of these little ones were emotional enough to feel their grief. There were the ones determine to send the message that animals must never be in captivity, that they are born free like all of us and their home is the lush wild. One painting revealed the depth of 'ahimsa" to animals by Buddha and another Jesus holding on to a lamb. Bothe Masters preached kindness to animals according this little artist.
FISHING CAT
One young Lady painted a touching message not to tamper with cubs of the fishing cat. She was focused on few cubs in a hole in the tree trunk watched by her mother from a distance. She also did not forget to put up a sign they should be left in their natural habitat and not for adoption or captivity. What a thoughtful and caring one she was. The others, apart from the elephant were focused on the tiger, cheetah, sloth bear, deer, wild boar, birds, reptiles, even bees and butterflies. etc, and many more along with their habitats and conservation.
THE WILDLIFE AND NATURE PROTECTION SOCIETY
conduct awareness programmers on preservation and sustenance of fauna and flora, they are taken on expeditions to expeditions to explore the thicket to savour and have close contact with nature and the glory of wilderness.
And at the end of the day, I am sure they will grow up in partnership with nature and as dedicated professional wildlife officials, among them who will take over the baton from The Youth Wing of the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society and face the future.
I am also hoping against hope, there will be another MENAKA GANDHI among them I also take this opportunity to thank profusely the media who pushed this cause with determination to save and sustain wildlife, especially The Elephant without whose dedication wildlife would have laid neglected, you are still continuing your wonderful quest and the nation is grateful.

Guiding light to discipline
Head Girl of Holy Cross College Gampaha Prashansa Gunawardane believes in being a powerful force for good. She believes in striving for an ideal. Above all, she believes in other people. Perfect Prefects features Gunawardane who is determined to make a change.
Gunawardane points out that younger people ought to be inspired by a role model who faces challenges in life without hunting for ways to get rid of them, who live with integrity, optimism, hope, determination and compassion. And most of all someone who can overcome any challenge, through strength and hope.
One is Nicholas Vujicic, whos a Christian Evangelist and a Motivational speaker. He is really a great inspiration. He took all his disabilities as challenges and now he is a great example and a great personality, and he uses his utmost strength to motivate all citizens worldwide. Hes unstoppable and stands strong with faith and confidence, said Gunawardane
Religious background
Being a student of Holy Cross College from grade one itself, has provided her with the atmosphere to form up her character socially, emotionally and ethically. With the religious background and all holy activities, she was able to build up her spirituality and love towards God.
With the excellent academic background, I have been able to gain a good quality education, which is a guiding light to become a knowledgeable and an intelligent girl. As my dear Alma Mater provides me with the platform to display my talents and skills of singing, debating, acting, announcing, and public speaking, I have been able to build up a balanced personality as an all-rounder and to add up positive qualities to my character. From grade Eight upwards, as I was elected to hold Primary and Junior Prefectship, I have been able to build up a personality with leadership qualities such as passion, self-confidence, authenticity, assertiveness, optimism, courage, flexibility and adaptability, perseverance and understanding, which was a major reason to be qualified as a Senior Prefect. The school influenced and changed me, to an entirely different character with the enhancement of all positive character traits and especially leadership qualities within me, explained Gunawardane.
She firmly believes that as we are humans we can change the world. Gunawardane stressed that because we are humans, with intelligence, with feelings and with the ability to proceed according to what we think, we have the possibility of changing the world.
Common aim
As an individual, we cannot change the entire world, but yes, we can do something. When all individuals of the whole world begin with doing something to change the world we can change the world. My preference is first to become the change that I wish to see in the world. I believe that once, every single person begins to think so, its effortless to achieve the common aim of changing the world and making a difference, said Gunawardane.
Gunawardane is Arts Stream student following English, Information and Communication Technology and Greek and Roman Civilization. She dreams of working as an Announcer or a TV Presenter, publishing novels.
My ambition is to become a Lawyer because I really hate injustice and inequality. Therefore my utmost aim is to take the lead with the weapon of justice and to help people who are suffering mainly because of injustice, to use my voice to speak the truth, work on behalf of discriminated people and stand high for what is right, stated Gunawardane.
Gunawardane is passionate about the matter of eradicating poverty from the world. She is convinced that if every individual helps one needy person and if all governments, social welfare groups and individuals work for it, of course, we can attain the objective of eradicating poverty.
Equal rights
And along with it, one of my greatest passions is woman empowerment and working for woman rights. I, in fact, the desire to rise up my voice and set off to help each woman to get inspired and motivated and to work for equal rights. Lend a hand to each and every woman to prove the purity and potential of womanhood, prohibit prostitution as a means of earning money for living, voicing up in order to stop rapes and sexually abusing and evade overruling of women. As a female, I want to do my maximum to create a pleasant and free atmosphere to all women who live in fear, loss of hope and isolation. And to motivate all women to raise womanhood up to the high principles and to stand against violence, elucidated Gunawardane.
Her message to the youth is that first one should build up attitudes that are suitable for a leader. She commented that its a must to have a balanced personality, which will definitely bring forth a positive impact on being a great and influential leader.
Make use of your passions for good, always speak aloud when you have to, it will inspire and fuel up to make a difference in the world. Be unique, be independent, whenever you deal with a team, open yourself to others ideas and viewpoints and understand one another.
Inspiration
A leader must be committed to the welfare of a community. He or she should build up a character that can withstand any challenge or obstacle. Each and every leader must certainly turn out to be an inspiration to all others. All the young people must understand that the outer society is comprised of a diversity of people who are holding different opinions. We must be able to live independently rather than depending on others for everything. Each individual must be able to stand alone with confidence and with a strong attitude, which will be an easy way to survive in a large society. And definitely its a must, to respect others ideas and to be helpful and caring, thatll help to stand long, in a massive and a complicated society, explained Gunawardane.
She loves reading adventure stories such as Hunger Game series, Lord of the Rings, mystery stories, Harry Potter and a great variety of Classics, such as Pride and Prejudice, Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights. She enjoys mystery and adventure stories creating a feeling of excitement and tension. She loves to read about fear, danger, war, victory and magic since they bring out amusement.
When I read the novel Jane Eyre, I was so much inspired by the character of Jane Eyre. She is at the top of my listing of favourite characters. I find her character so extraordinary and unique, because of her character traits and attitudes. She is very much principled, determined and strong-willed, which are important qualities. She was able to forgive the people who wronged her - indeed thats a major positive quality. She is a person who relies on herself and her own intelligence. Though her life was bitter at first, she displays initiative, resilience in the face of challenges, honesty, depth, clarity and a massive capacity of love and to be loyal. To me Jane Eyre is a perfect role model to follow, as she prevails against everything that is thrown at her from the world, points out Gunawardane.
Real inspiration
One leader she admires is Barack Obama the Former President of the USA, who is a real inspiration and a great example to many leaders. She points out that in general, he is a good husband to his wife and a caring father to his children. His humble nature is revealed in his personal life.
He never promised anything beyond the limits of his office nor set himself as a Saint. He offered hope and change to all Americans, which was even a motivation to all people worldwide. Obamas campaign used the slogan change we can believe in. Belief in change is a fundamental, foundational quality of his leadership. He is a person who makes endings into beginnings. He empowered others to speak up about the things impacting their lives. He had the attitude of We, not I. Its a major attitude that should be within every leader, who works with a team to achieve a common aim together. From his character all leaders find a superior quality which should be developed within all leaders, that is a leader must be a great communicator and of course a great listener, and definitely a great speaker. This passionate character influenced me to learn through his life.
Lastly, I take this as an opportunity to thank my dear beloved parents who are always by me just as my guardian angels and who always motivate me to be unique. A special thanks goes to Rev. Sister Principal, Rev. Sister Vice Principal, all the Rev. sisters and teachers of the staff, for helping me to reach up to this level, said Gunawardane.

Hair and how!
People often keep memoirs to honour loved ones who have passed away. One woman wanted to honour her mothers life and decided to keep an unusual memento; she decided to keep locks of her deceased mothers hair. And now she needs help from someone whos willing to make a dress out of it.
The 61-year-old, from Bristol, has launched an appeal to find a factory capable of creating the dress. The woman, who wants to remain unnamed, says shed been collecting her mothers hair for four years before she died, and has set aside around 15,000 for the dress to be made.
The woman posted the request on fashion manufacturing marketplace Sewport last week, but due to the unusual nature of her request, has been unable to find a manufacturer or seamstress to work with her.
Shed been collecting the hair since her mum fell ill in 2014 and didnt initially know what to do with it until recently.
The request states that the manufacturer who takes the job will need to recreate the ballroom-style dress, with the sleeves, neckline, bottom trim and bodice decorated with the hair.
She would like the dress to be as authentic as possible and has sketched out what she would like it to look like.
The daughter has said that 15,000 has been put aside for the creation of the dress, as she knows its weird. She would like the dress completed before next August  one year on from her mothers death.
It states that she wants the outfit to replicate her mothers wedding dress from 1953 and also stated that she has one full box of hair, which she hopes will be enough.
Obviously its not every day we get requests like this through, and despite having more than 500 manufacturers on site, no ones shown any interest in carrying out the work yet, said Boris Hodakel, Sewport founder.
The lady, who has asked to remain anonymous, is just looking for someone to help her create a final memento of her mother. Our goal is to give everyone, from professional designers to students, the chance to create exactly what they have envisioned  even if it is a dress made of hair.

Harry, Meghan not affected  by New Zealand quake
NEW ZEALAND: A 6.1 magnitude earthquake rattled parts of central New Zealand Tuesday, where British royals Meghan and Harry are on tour, but officials said it caused no major damage.
The quake was felt in Wellington during a session of parliament, prompting lawmakers to stop deliberations and seek refuge as a precaution.
There was no tsunami threat and the quake was not strongly felt in Auckland, where the touring royals continued with a public walkabout on the citys waterfront.
Reporters travelling with the couple said they did not feel any tremors during the quake, which the US Geological Survey (USGS) gave a magnitude of 6.1.
New Zealands official GeoNet seismic monitoring service said a 6.2 quake struck at a depth of 207 kilometres (128 miles) in the central North Island about 340 kilometres northeast of Wellington.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said it was widely felt across the centre of the country, despite the depth of the epicentre, and urged Kiwis to check on those around you.
Civil Defence Minister Kris Faafoi said there had been no reports of damage or injuries.
I think some people might be a little nervy and thats understandable but its just a case of following those safety messages and being prepared, he told reporters.
I think if there was anything major wed know by now. Faafoi said proceedings in parliament house were temporarily suspended because of heavy shaking in the building.
We all felt it in the house, I was in there at the time... and just for the immediate safety of those in the house (the speaker) saw fit to suspend proceedings, he said.
I think that was the wise thing to do as we felt it quite heavily. New Zealand lies on the boundary of the Australian and Pacific tectonic plates, which form part of the so-called Ring of Fire, and experiences up to 15,000 tremors a year.

How far have we come in fielding since 2015
Three years ago Sri Lankas interim head coach Jerome Jayaratne labelled the national cricket teams fielding standards as the worst in Asia.
To quote Jayaratne: We are now the worst fielding side in Asia, we were never behind Pakistan but now we have gone behind them. India proved that they were better than us and even Bangladesh are fielding better than us.
Other than the bowling which is holding the team together, the batting, fielding and fitness has let us down, Jayaratne said. It's a lot to do with the fitness levels. The way our guys are fielding they are carrying excess weight and we are in shambles.
The big question that needs to be asked now is how far have we improved in our fielding and catching since then. To be frank its not much.
The catching display that Sri Lanka put up in the one-off T20 international against England at the R Premadasa Stadium was one of their worst in recent times.
No team that spills three catches within the space of two overs in a T20 match can afford to finish on the winning side. The worst part is that all three catches were dropped off one batsman Jason Roy who went onto score a blazing half century  69 off 36 balls to lay the foundation for Englands challenging total of 187-8. Had the first catch offered by Roy at 34 been taken England would have been four down at that stage for 65 runs in the ninth over and Sri Lanka who ended up with a total of 157 would not have been chasing 188, but something less than that and may have even won the contest. Roy was to receive further reprieves at 41 and 53 due to some butter-fingered catching.
One of the most talked about fielding lapses even today is the one that cost Sri Lanka a place in the ICC Champions Trophy semi-final in 2017 at Cardiff against Pakistan where they threw away a brilliant opportunity to defend a below par total of 236. Thisara Perera put down what could only be described as the simplest of chances given by Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed at mid-on off the luckless Lasith Malinga off whose bowling three chances were missed. Sarfraz then on 38 went onto score an unbeaten 61 and steer Pakistan to win the Champions trophy final against India after defeating hosts England in the semi-final.
Looking at todays performance, well, I thought we were pathetic once again. If we had held those catches, it would have been a different story, especially at very crucial times. First over, and towards the end, and where we let go of Sarfraz was very crucial. Being an international team well, I thought weve improved a little bit, but today was not really our day, Mathews said at the post-match press conference when asked if Sri Lanka was the worlds worst fielding unit.
Sri Lankas fielding standards today are a far cry from a country whose fielding was rated one of the best in the world in the nineties and early 2000s. There is no doubt that fielding improves with confidence and confidence is built on victories which has been few and far between for the current team in the past two years where performances have sunk to a level that they have been unable to improve from their position of eighth rank in the ODI standings for more than a year.
Sri Lanka were lucky that they were not asked to qualify for the 2019 World Cup through a qualifying round for had that happened the chances of them coming through ahead of nations like West Indies Afghanistan and Zimbabwe would have been highly questionable.
That doubt has arisen not only from the fielding point of view but also from the batting aspect where legendary cricketers like Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan have been hard to replace. This has led to tinkering with the batting order from match to match which has made matters worse where the top order batters come for a match without knowing which position they are going to bat next. So much for building of confidence.
An emphasis was laid ahead of the recently concluded ODI series against England which Sri Lanka lost 3-1 that batting positions would remain untouched but injuries to players and bad weather forced changes to take place when overs were curtailed.
Consistency has not been part of the teams genre for quite some time and unless they can achieve that they will always struggle to perform against top level sides. It is what the present side which is quite a young one, lacks. They were brilliant in their ground fielding but the catching left much to be desired. The good old saying that Catches win matches still holds true to this day. Unless Sri Lanka can achieve a level of consistency in that area they will only be performing well in patches.

Indias Ahmed warned for  Samuels send-off in ODI
Mumbai, Tuesday: India paceman Khaleel Ahmed has received an official warning for aggressively charging towards West Indies batsman Marlon Samuels in the fourth ODI in Mumbai, the International Cricket Council announced Tuesday.
The 20-year-old Ahmed fell foul of the global governing body's code of conduct during the 14th over in West Indies' chase on Monday when he yelled at Samuels after taking his wicket.
"The left-armer, after having Marlon Samuels caught in the slips by Rohit Sharma, advanced aggressively towards the departing batter, which, in the view of the on-field umpires, could have provoked a reaction from the Windies player," said an ICC statement.
Ahmed, who has played five ODIs since making his debut in September, returned career-best figures of 3-13 in India's 224-run crushing win over West Indies to lead the five-match series 2-1.
One demerit point has now been added to Ahmed's disciplinary record after he admitted the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by match referee Chris Broad.

Industrial Development Board  conducts Digital Marketing survey
The Industrial Information Unit of the Centre for Entrepreneurship Development and Consultancy Service, under aegis of the Industrial Development Board of Ceylon (IDB) conducted a seminar recently on Digital Marketing via Facebook, Google and You Tube for the benefit of Small and Medium Entrepreneurs (SMEs) at the IDB Auditorium, Katubedda, Moratuwa.
As Small and Medium Entrepreneurs (SMEs) play an important role in improving the national economy of this country, they needed to be assisted to improve their vital role they play, by studying the variety of aspects of global economy to fit themselves with the new trends.
A considerable number of representatives from both State and private sector were present along with the Small and Medium Entrepreneurs (SMEs) at the inaugural seminar.
Thilina Karunanayake, a lecturer from the Marketing Department of the Kelaniya University addressed those present, encouraging them to pursue the fields they have chosen with trust and confidence as there lies their future.
It is claimed that the Sri Lanka Government planned to digitalize the activities of the entire State sector and this move in turn will impose those in the business world to recognize and improve their qualities and capabilities to do business with the world at large. The concept of digital marketing will have a greater impact and help immensely to improve the role of the Small and Medium Entrepreneurs (SMEs), who compose a greater part of the national economy.
Apart from this, the IT Unit of the IDB has decided to continue with a series of seminars and workshops to enhance the knowledge of those directly involved in the SMEs with the support of IDB Chairman, Mahinda Jinasena, IDB Director General, P.L.U. Rathnamalala, Human Resource Development Directress, Malani Ganegoda, IT, Assistant Directress, Swarna Wijekoon and Director Marketing and Media, Sarath Udayasiri.
We are confident the proposed seminar and the future workshops would help to eradicate any fear SMEs entertain and make them voluntarily adapt to new technology and pursue vital trends, which are most beneficial to them in the long run, IT sources said.

KOICA supports Mullaitivu water quality project
The completion of the second stage of water quality enhancement project was celebrated in Maritimepattu in the Mullaitivu District on October 25.
This is a three-year project which is being conducted by Lamp INGO and funded by KOICA for villagers in the Maritimepattu Division where some people are suffering from Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).
The ceremony was attended by KOICA Country Director Lee Dong Ku, Mullaitivu District Secretary Ketheeswaran, Lamp INGO Sri Lanka head officer Seo Jin Tae and International Manager Ahn Tae Ju and the villagers who will be provided with safe drinking water.
The main drinking water for the villagers was obtained from ground-water wells which are contaminated with agricultural chemicals and fertilizer, which was the main reason for the cause of water-borne diseases and CKD.
However, with the 60m deep well, operated by Lamp INGO, the people will be able to get safe drinking water at a low cost. Furthermore, a resident autonomy committee has been organised and will carry out action to maintain the water facility effectively.
Ketheeswaran said: This town was affected by the war, so people are in need of many things to sustain their lives. I would like to thank Lamp INGO for giving us the prerequisite, water. We will make sure that the facility is managed well so that the people can have a better life.
I also want to specially thank KOICA, which made the project happen.
Lee said: Safe drinking water is essential for a healthy life. Pregnant women, the elderly, and infants with weak immunity in particular need safe drinking water.
KOICA Sri Lanka office places high priority on development projects in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
KOICA in cooperation with WFP supports increasing resilience to drought by establishing community and household water harvesting systems and recently, KOICA also signed a multi-year partnership with UNICEF for the Kilinochchi district to provide better educational opportunities for young people.

Studying literature enables one to better understand social situations, history, ones own emotions, and various cultural practices. It also makes one more empathetic.
Literature should be studied for a richer life. Without it, we miss out on so much. Think of all the places we get to go, people we get to meet, situations we get to experience without ever leaving our living rooms! Without reading about these people, places, events, we quite possibly would never experience similar situations. By reading about them, discussing them with others, thinking about how we would react in similar situations, we are learning. We are gathering information and tools for our life toolbox. Every book you read changes you...even if only slightly. You are a different person on the other side of it whether you recognize it or not. You are learning, collecting material, developing a personality, discovering likes and dislikes about yourself. You are studying the human condition, and this is important because you are part of the world itself.

MATHEMAGICIANS!
Several species with their own peculiar characteristics exist in nature and sometimes they may even surprise us with extraordinary abilities. Elephants are spectacular creatures also known for their memory and it turns out there may be more to these gentle giants. A new experiment has revealed that math skills of elephants are closer to those of human beings than any other animal. This was revealed when researchers successfully taught an Asian elephant to use a giant touch screen that showed math problems.
The 14-year-female was able to choose from pictures which contained the most items and pointed at them with her trunk. This is the first evidence of animals having cognitive characteristics which are similar to human counting.
Meanwhile this isnt an ability that Asian elephants share with two species of African elephants. The Scientist

Lalith is a member of the well-known de Mel family from Moratuwa. His great-grandfather, Johannes de Mel, bought hundreds of acres of Crown land to plant coconuts, from the King of England, who owned all the land in Sri Lanka at the time. His father was Clinton de Mel. His mother, Lois, died when he was seven.
De Mel recently launched his book which traces his journey to become the first Sri Lankan on the main board of a Top 100 Company in the UK. It is a narrative of his career from his school days at St. Josephs College, where he was instrumental in introducing rugby, straight through to Cambridge University and then returning to work for Shell where he honed his marketing skills and got caught up in motor racing.
Switch then to the British multinational Reckitt and Colman, where in the days of expatriate managers he rose up the ladder in a quick succession to the top, and then spent time in the Brazil business which prepared him for his greater international role to earn a place inthe Main Board of the Group, a top 100 company in the UK, while also being the first and only Sri Lankan to do so. He was also recognised as the Godfather of the Groups pharmaceutical business.
When he retired, a cluster of opportunities was awaiting him. His company retained him to do a years consultancy to develop a long term strategy for their pharmaceutical business, and he also became a British Government nominated Director of CDC plc, a government owned entity created to support development in poorer countries.
He returned to Sri Lanka to and was invited by the then President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga to be the Chairman of Sri Lanka Telecom at a time when it went into a private public partnership with NTT.
He went on to be called upon for a number of high profile roles in the Government sector. These included his terms as: Chairman of the Board of Investment, Senior Advisor to Ministry of Finance overseeing the monitoring and implementation of major government infrastructure projects, Director of Peoples Bank, Director of the State Enterprise Management Agency, and Chairman Tourism Cluster of the National Council for Economic Development. He worked free in all his government appointments and took no remuneration.
He also made his experience available to a number of private sector companies, serving on the Boards of John Keells Holdings, Hemas Holdings, First Capital, Piramal Glass, Serendib Hotels and Delmege Forsythe. Narratives and anecdotes from his experience in these companies are included in the book.
