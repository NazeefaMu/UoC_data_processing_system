Kate Middleton turns editor for a day

UK: Prince William's wife Kate Middleton today turned guest editor for the UK edition of The Huffington Post to tackle the stigma associated with the "heart-breaking" and "devastating" issues of mental illness among children.
The Duchess of Cambridge launched "Young Minds Matter", a global initiative as part of her role as patron of a number of children's charities, including Place2Be and Action on Addiction.
"For too long we have been embarrassed to admit when our children need emotional or psychiatric help," she wrote in one her first blog posts for the news website.
"Like most parents today, William and I would not hesitate to seek help for our children if they needed it. We hope to encourage George and Charlotte to speak about their feelings, and to give them the tools and sensitivity to be supportive peers to their friends as they get older," the 34-year-old mother of two said on a more personal note.
"We know there is no shame in a young child struggling with their emotions or suffering from a mental illness."
The royal is carrying out her editorial role from a temporary newsroom set up at the royal couple's London home of Kensington Palace.
In preparation for the day, Kate had already helped to commission a series of articles, blogs and videos from several leading figures in the mental health sector.
The issue has been close to her heart since she married the second in line to Britain's throne in 2011.
"I often heard some heart-breaking stories about lives that had been torn apart, with devastating impacts for all involved, particularly children. What I did not expect was to see that time and time again, the issues that led people to addiction and destructive decision making seemed to almost always stem from unresolved childhood challenges," she writes. The Huffington Post published data showing that one in three parents worry that they will look like a bad mother or father if their child has a mental health problem.
Stephen Hull, editor-in-chief of Huffington Post UK, said: "The duchess has been extremely helpful in connecting us to the people who are working hard to tackle this issue."- PTI

Nepal to rebuild historic Dharahara Tower on its own

NEPAL: Nepal has decided to rebuild on its own the historic Dharahara tower that was turned into rubble during the April 2015 earthquake.
Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and his Cabinet ministers today decided to contribute their one month's salary as seed money to rebuild the monument.
A citizens fund will be established under the campaign "I will construct Dharahara" from Wednesday that will contribute towards the reconstruction.
As many as 180 bodies were found in the rubble after the tower collapsed on April 25 last year. Over 9,000 people were killed in the earthquake.
The department of archaeology said 754 historical, cultural and religious monuments in 20 districts, including the 61-metre-tall Dharahara, were damaged in the quake and its aftershocks.
Among them, 133 were reduced to rubble, while 621 sustained varied degrees of damage.
Oli, while inaugurating the reconstruction process of Dharahara at Sundhara today, announced to give a month's salary - Rs. 61,820 -- for the citizen's fund for the reconstruction of the tower.
He also requested all Nepalese people living in and outside the country to donate funds for the reconstruction.
"Dharahara is a symbol of our unity and strength, it is an identity of all Nepalese. It has to be reconstructed under the fund collected from each individual," said Mr Oli. Dharahara, built some 250 years back, was the tallest building in Kathmandu and could be seen across the valley. - IANS

Oxygen was present on Earth far earlier than thought

UK: Small levels of atmospheric oxygen had already developed on Earth about 3.8 billion years ago, much earlier than previously thought, a new study has found.
Reconstructing the emergence and evolution of life on our planet is tightly linked to the questions as to when and to what extent Earth's atmosphere became oxygenated.
Most researchers agree that the oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere happened in two major steps - the first during the Great Oxidation Event about 2.5 to 2.4 billion years ago, and the second during the Late Neoproterozoic Era around 750 to 540 million years ago.
The latter is thought to have been the cause for the emergence of animals during the 'Cambrian explosion' around 540 to 520 million years ago. Researchers, led by Robert Frei from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, found evidence for the presence of small concentrations of oxygen on Earth 3.8 billion years ago.
The researchers analysed Earth's oldest Banded Iron Formations (BIFs) from Western Greenland.
BIFs are marine chemical sediments originally comprised of alternating layers of silica and iron-hydroxides and are widely used as geochemical archives.
The reason for this is that they retain information on the composition and presence of oxygenation/reduction processes in ambient seawater and on the interaction of the atmosphere with Earth's surface.
The researchers used concentrations and isotope compositions, ie variations of the same elements with different atomic weight, of the elements chromium (Cr) and uranium (U) present in the BIFs.
Chromium and uranium were used as these elements weather rapidly when continental landmasses are exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as oxygen (O2).
After weathering, they are transported to the oceans by rivers, where they are deposited with chemical sediments and serve as geochemical signals of weathering by ROS.
The fact that the analyses of the BIF layers from Western Greenland show elements that require presence of oxygen in the atmosphere opens up for the possibility of evolution of the earliest primitive photosynthetic life forms as early as 3.8 billion years ago. - AFP

He played under Muditha Fernando in the under 15 division one and they were Runners up to Royal College, Colombo and in the next year he led the side and lost to St Peter's College in the semi finals.
