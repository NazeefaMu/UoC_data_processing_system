Countdown to the Cargills Sarasaviya Film Awards 2018 begins
Quality of content has never mattered more !
The Cargills Sarasaviya Film Awards is one of the most prestigious film award ceremonies to be held in Sri Lanka. Winning an award is considered to be one of the highest honours that can be bestowed upon a film artiste. It is a rare opportunity and one that is truly special and close to ones heart. And on August 3, at the BMICH, history will be made, when film artistes who have appeared in the films of 2016 and 2017 are given their day. This is Cargills Sarasaviya Film Awards 2018.
Sarasaviya Awards is presented each year by the Sarasaviya weekly newspaper in collaboration with the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited (Lake House).
Chairman ANCL, Krishantha Cooray stated that the film industry in Sri Lanka and the Sarasaviya Film Festival is one that evokes strong sentiment stating that it is an honour to be associated with it.
On April 10, 1963 Sarasaviya paper was launched at Lake House to contribute to a cinema culture that is noble and of high standard in art form. So in May 10, 1964 the first Sarasaviya Film Festival began. The intention of Lake House was not profit or glory but the intention was to create something of a certain standard and quality. The aim here is to bring together popular culture with aesthetic value onto the same platform. It is certainly a great achievement for those who win these awards as the Film Festival is held in great esteem by its viewers. This is a golden opportunity for the winners and a matter of pride for all involved. ANCL and Cargills will never interfere in the process of selection. It is completely transparent and impartial, said Cooray.
Cooray mentioned that it is pleasure being a partner with Cargills and this time as well as on previous occasions in the past, the endeavor will most certainly be a success. Cooray pointed out that in the life of any artiste there is a desire to win a Sarasaviya award. It is a pillar of strength to the Sinhalese Cinema industry.
Editor Sarasaviya newspaper, Aruna Gunaratna said that we can be proud of the Sarasaviya Film Awards which is an occasion to be celebrated openly.
This is a huge and momentous festival and must be loudly proclaimed to the whole country. In the history of Cinema in this country, Cargills Sarasaviya Film Awards without doubt holds a special place. It is has great prestige attached to it and is unrivalled and this cannot be disputed. ANCL has always been of service to this country. It is because of ANCL that this film award ceremony is in existence. The Sarasaviya film awards ceremony began in 1964 giving the film industry in Sri Lanka a much needed boost, said Gunaratna.
Gunaratne pointed out that the film industry in Sri Lanka with its traditions owes much to the Cargills Sarasaviya Film Awards.
Sarasaviya Films Awards is a film festival that has overshadowed other competition. The competition this time is big and is keenly contested. This film festival and its panelists are impartial, transparent and completely fair. There will be a variety of awards including the Lester James Peiris Award in remembrance of that great director who nurtured generations. In this country there was a relationship between the cinema and the press with Lake House and the Regal Cinema facing each other. When Asokamala was in the process of being brought to the screen the main papers of Lake House  Dinamina, Silumina, Daily News and Observer gave publicity, said Gunaratna.
Executive Director Ceylon Theatres Ltd, Sanjaya Niles, pointed out that Cargills is a name associated with retailing, food and financial services in Sri Lanka and that it is a lesser known fact that Cargills is part of the CT Holdings group which has had an association with the Sri Lanka film industry for many years.
The course of the company was set by our visionary leader and late chairman Albert. A. Page. He took over the reigns of Ceylon theatres with one purpose and that was to entertain people. Way back in 1956, Ceylon Theatres began the first film production and processing facilities in the country with the establishment of Ceylon Studios ltd. Thus paving the way for development of local film production and expertise. Ceylon Theatres has produced notable films, namely Nidhanaya, Ada Rae, Kusumalatha and Akkara Paha.
Even in difficult times the company continued to invest in the sector expanding and upgrading the film screening facilities for the benefit of the patrons, said Niles.
Ceylon Theatres does not produce movies today but boasts the largest number of movie screens in the country- 15 screens in Colombo, Jaffna, Kandy, Negombo, Gampaha and Nuwaraeliya with plans for 21 new screens across eight locations. It is committed to the further development of this sector.
With our long history the promotion of Arts and Culture in Sri Lanka, Cargills and the overall CT Holdings group of companies steadfastly believe in the artistic skills and the talents blossoming in Sri Lanka. We believe that the movie industry will continue to grow and expand on the strong foundation of past successes. The recognition of the artiste is a vital step in the continued development of the industry and we wish Sarasaviya 2018 festival every success, said Niles.
Veteran actor Ravindra Randeniya too expressed his ideas by saying that the quality of local cinema is measured by the Sarasaviya Film Festival. He won the Best Actor award in 1984, 1985, 1989 and 1990.
The difference this film festival has made to our lives as artistes, and the support it has given to us is something that no other organization has been able to do. It is something that is totally dedicated to the industry and welfare of the artistes. It had done so much for me which I cannot express in words. This is something that is invaluable to me and it has etched my name in cinematic history. I strongly feel that this film festival needs to continue into the future. It is special and it has powerful meaning for me. The name of Cargills is legendary in Sri Lanka. We can place our faith in Cargills and Sarasaviya, said Randeniya

Record-breaking keeper saves penalty, but Egypt fall to Saudis
Volgograd, Monday: Essam El Hadary, the oldest player ever to appear at a World Cup, marked his record achievement with one outstanding penalty save for Egypt but was powerless to stop a second in a 2-1 defeat by Saudi Arabia on Monday.
The 45-year-old goalkeeper flew to his right to make a spectacular stop in the 39th minute from Fahad Al-Muwallads spot-kick, awarded for handball, at the Volgograd Arena.
But Saudi Arabia scored deep into stoppage time in both halves, with Salem Al-Dawsaris last-gasp winner securing their first World Cup victory since a run to the last 16 in 1994.
Mohamed Salahs Egypt still have not recorded a World Cup finals win in three appearances, despite the Liverpool talismans superb opening goal.
El Hadary was 45 years and 161 days old when he took to the field as the two already-eliminated teams in Group A played only for pride.
He smashed the age record set by Colombia goalkeeper Faryd Mondragon, who was aged 43 years and three days when he played against Japan in Brazil in 2014.
Salah was named in the starting line-up as expected and thrilled an Egyptian-dominated crowd of 36,823 by opening the scoring in trademark fashion after 22 minutes.
The 26-year-old controlled a long ball over the top with one touch of his left boot at pace and did not break stride before lobbing a deft finish with the same foot over the onrushing goalkeeper Yasser Al-Mosailem.
Salah at least had the consolation of scoring Egypts first goal from open play at the World Cup since May 27, 1934, when Abdulrahman Fawzi netted in a 4-2 defeat by Hungary. The Egyptians were still clinging onto their lead when the Saudis were awarded a controversial second penalty deep into first-half stoppage time as Fahad appeared to pull the shirt of the covering Ali Gabr before going down in a heap.
But after a VAR-induced review that took almost five minutes to complete, Colombian referee Wilmar Roldan decided to stick with his original decision.
It was second time lucky from the spot as Salman Al-Faraj took responsibilty from 12 yards and El Hadary could not repeat his heroics as the first-half clock ticked past 51 minutes.
El Hadary made his debut for Egypt in 1996, a year before his Egyptian teammate Ramadan Sobhi was born.
He is older than three coaches at Russia 2018 -- Roberto Martinez of Belgium, Serbias Mladen Krstajic and Aliou Cisse of Senegal.
The Pharoahs captain lived up to his nickname of High Dam with two stunning saves from headers in the second half.
But in the fifth minute of second-half injury-time, Al-Dawsari popped up in the box to beat El Hadary with the last kick of the match and secure a famous Saudi win. AFP

## Title: Reviewing Judicial Recusal Guidelines

Reviewing Judicial Recusal Guidelines
When a judge recuses himself (or herself) from hearing a nationally important case and the hearing is postponed, it becomes a disturbing news for any layman. If recusal happens four times in the same case resulting long postponements, then its natural for the layman to become worried. The obvious question he might ask, is; What happens to the Common Law and doctrine of the Duty to Sit
At this point the two doctrines  Recusal and Duty to sit - need to be clarified.
Recusal (of a judge) means excusing oneself from a case because of a potential conflict of interest or lack of impartiality. It is an ancient civil law concept fundamental to democracy and due process. Prior to the 19th Century, judges were allowed to preside in situations that today would almost universally be considered improper. Disqualification of judges for bias was rare, and except for those cases that contravened the core principle that no man should be a judge in his own case, only a direct financial stake in a case usually disqualified a judge. This view persisted into the 20th Century.
The second point is Duty to Sit doctrine. This doctrine emphasizes a judges obligation to hear and decide cases, without fear or favour, affection or ill will, unless there are compelling grounds for disqualification. Professor Upendra Baxi, scholar and professor of law at the University of Warwick, UK, addressing a seminar in 2016 said that we need to question why there is recusal, and whether reason for such recusal is needed or not. He added that there is a Doctrine of Recusal as well as Doctrine of Duty to sit and since these two doctrines are conflicting to each other, a balance must be sought between the two in the interest of true justice.
Gotabhaya issue
The subject matter of recusal has surfaced in the recent past mainly due to a specific case filed by the former Defence Secretary, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. He filed a FR petition in 2015 seeking a stay order preventing his arrest by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID), which was probing the controversial MiG deal, the Avant Garde issue and the share purchase of Apollo Hospital. The case was first taken up on May 13, 2015. Since then, four justices of the Supreme Court have recused themselves from hearing the case.
The situation has become more intriguing on account of the fact that no reasons were given by the judges for their recusals. The fact that judges, at different times, have recused themselves from this particular case have led to speculation specially since the public is not aware of the reasons for such withdrawals. One might even wonder, whether our respected and learned justices are abdicating their constitutional duties and responsibilities.
Solutions
Fortunately, the voluntary recusals by judges in Sri Lankan jurisdictions have been few and far between. However, some believe, that due to rapidly changing political and social scenarios in our country, it may become most routine in time to come.
Notwithstanding criticism that the duty to sit doctrine is an out-dated doctrine, which some believe needed to be buried in todays context, judges of the American Supreme Court have continuously drawn sustenance from the duty to sit doctrine on the assumption that the doctrine was activated by public policy reasons.
Keeping aligned with the international thinking, what can we, in Sri Lanka, do to effect changes in recusal procedure A legal expert involved in the constitutional reforms process speaking to the Sunday Observer recently, explained how critical it was for the current system to be reviewed with provisions made available for similar circumstances. Appointing ad-hoc judges from the Court of Appeal was one option, the expert said. If the trend continues, the Chief Justice would then have to discuss the matter with other judges and decide how to proceed.
New Zealand experience
Perhaps, we could learn a lesson or two from New Zealand experience. In March 2017, New Zealand introduced Recusal guidelines for their Supreme Court.
The guidelines were published in accordance with s 171(2) of the Senior Courts Act 2016. The following are some extracts from the guidelines of New Zealand:
1. The guiding principle is that a judge is disqualified from sitting if in the circumstances there is a real possibility that in the eyes of a fair-minded and fully informed observer the judge might not be impartial in reaching a decision in the case. An instance is where a judge has a material interest in the outcome of the appeal.
2. The test is a two-step one requiring consideration of: (a) what are the circumstances relevant to the possible need for recusal because of apparent bias (b) whether those circumstances lead to a reasonable apprehension the judge may not be impartial.
3. The test requires ascertainment of, first, what it is that might possibly lead to a reasonable apprehension that the judge might decide the case other than on its merits and, secondly, whether there is a logical and sufficient connection between those circumstances and that apprehension.
4. Once leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been sought, each judge has a duty to acquaint all colleagues in the Court with any known circumstances which may give rise to a concern among the litigants, or the public, that the judge might not be impartial in the case. Every judge is similarly under a duty to bring to the attention of all other colleagues any circumstances which may lead to such a concern in respect of any other judge.
5. If, after discussion of the circumstances with all other judges, the judge concerned is satisfied there is a real possibility that he or she cannot act impartially or is satisfied that a fair-minded and fully informed observer might reach that view, the judge will decide not to sit on the appeal.
6. In any other case, after such discussions, the judge will issue a minute addressed to the parties to the litigation drawing their attention to the relevant circumstances and inviting them to indicate if they have any views on whether the judge should sit on the appeal. The minute will indicate that in addition to indicating their views and drawing the judges attention to any additional matters thought relevant, if a party objects to the judge sitting on the grounds raised or any other grounds, counsel should say so. The minute should set a time for response by the parties.
7. If an objection is received, that will be determined by all the judges available, other than the judge who is the subject of the objection. Those judges may call for submissions and hear the parties as they think appropriate.
8. If no objection to the judge sitting is received, all judges will consider any material provided in response to the judges minute but the judge concerned will decide whether or not to sit.
9. Where a party (of its own motion) considers there to be a possible conflict of interest, a memorandum must be filed at the earliest possible opportunity setting out the particular circumstances giving rise to the alleged conflict. The Court will (usually) ask for a response from the other parties. Subject top paragraph 10, the objection will be dealt with in terms of paragraphs 5 and 7of these guidelines.
10. Recusal applications made at a hearing or close in time to the allocated hearing date of an application or an appeal are generally not appropriate. If an issue of conflict of interest is raised at this late stage, the Court hearing the application or the appeal will usually deal with the matter.
The other guidelines clarify about disclosure of conflict of interest: principles and practice.
New Zealand has separate guidelines for High Courts and District Courts.
Introducing guidelines for Courts is a highly sensitive issue. Hence, there needs to be a lot of discussions among stakeholders need to be done before a decision is taken. It could be done either through judicial initiative or by legislative intervention, whichever is agreeable for all. Clear and forthright standards would enhance the courts credibility and the public trust.

Adrift
Sea-worthy see!
Our union with her happens suddenly. The opening scenes link us with her trapped under debris. We need not be told what has struck. The torn mast sail and the rest of the ship wreckage say it all. A catastrophic event has happened, for sure. Hurricane Probably. But we are not privy to the details yet. Not yet until we are more than halfway through the movies running time.
If Baltasar Kormakurs Adrift is ever to hold a special place in our hearts that should be because of his directorial excellence  of course, together with the dextrous cooperation of his cinematographer. Kormakur has no respect for (or maybe has no faith in) the established norms of filmmaking. He deconstructs the plot and gives prominence to the core theme  suffering, that is  over overreaching climax effect.
Where a conventional filmmaker or a movie buff would consider it most ideal to have the story flown from a proper beginning to an end, Kormakur harbours a different design. He thrusts the roles of the scriptwriter and his own to the dimness and pulls the cinematographer out into the daylight. And yes, Robert Richardson deserves mention in this essay for that matter.
Richardsons distant shots of the yacht made small in the almost ripple-less aquamarine vast ocean recede the soul of the audience into a philosophical plain. He syringes new emotions to the true story that happened in Tami Oldham Ashcrafts life. The vast blue ocean is not as sweet as it seems for a solitary female with no sign of human civilisation in sight. The frequent camera moves from distance in slightly different angles makes us not bored at all. Reminiscent of Vincent Van Goughs The Starry Night painting, the ocean shots surge emotions in the viewer. Those emotions may need fresh definitions.
Adrift belongs to the adventure genre. But it is not some childish cowboy type adventure, thankfully. It is the real-life adventure. Many reviewers of Adrift make reference to All Is Lost (2013). On the surface level, both films could be similar. But on a philosophical terrain, it bears more similarities with Life of Pi, where spirituality and the real-life adventure go hand in hand. Like Pi Patel, Tami Ashcraft (starred by Shailene Woodley) is a vegetarian. But how far can she sustain her philosophy  especially in the middle of a struggle for life in a 40-day expedition amid a yacht rubble She finally swims down under the ocean to pierce a fish and eats it raw  an eerie scene even for non-vegetarian. Many more experiences of such weight are inevitable when you are struggling for life at sea for over a month.
The alternation between the past and present scenes is confusing. The story demands that confusion in order for the viewer to empathise with the core theme of the story. Halfway through, the genesis of the tragedy unravels.
Tami Oldham Ashcrafts partner Richard Sharp is entrusted with a tempting job: taking a 44-foot yacht on a 4000-mile expedition from Tahiti to San Diego. The job is tempting because Sharp is a sailor and both are adventure-freaks. Everything is calm before the storm, the Hurricane Raymond taking charge of the yacht reducing it to almost debris. With Sharp washed overboard, the audience calls up for a moment how Tami was trying to rise over the wreckage in the opening sequence of scenes.
The love between them develops in the alternation of the scenes from past and present. The mutual interests nurture the love. So to say, we share her heartbreak and anguish over losing her fianc. That figure  41 days  is a go figure best believed in the widescreen plots centred on a sea adventure. But it is an actual figure. Tami Oldham Ashcraft actually struggled for survival for 41 days at sea. Kormakurs film is an adaptation of her memoir: Red Sky in Mourning: A True Story of Love, Loss and Survival at Sea. In conventional terms, the closing scenes of the film recede into anti-climax. But then again, the story does not cry out for the climax. It is a story of true-to-life adventure, love and above all a titanic tragedy.
Could Tami actually save her partner Or was it her hallucination, a probable condition caused by the tragedy We are in the dark. But that is not important either. What matters most is that one courageous woman weathered a storm. She did that against all the odds, living off peanut butter and water running out fast!
Robert Richardson (cinematographer) and Shailene Woodley (Tami) together weave that epic poem of the 41-day tragedy. How could one woman survive for 41 days Writing down the emotions is not that easy. Capturing it on the camera is even more difficult. Playing it out could be the toughest job.
Over the first 10 days, she had the physical courage to go through the trauma of her forehead bruise stitch. But that physical courage gradually ebbs away as food, dry clothes, usable water and other supplies run down. Her facial skin shrinks and once-rosy lips darken. She has to wear the same garment for days (sans upper undergarments) and given to nudity at one point. She runs into sudden hopes but very soon becomes a victim of dashed hopes. Worse still, she has to look after her partner whose leg injury may turn out to be lethal at some point. But her feelings for her partner are hardly a diminishing factor. The meagre leftover of food supplies, she feeds her partner (however hungry she looks in eyes) first.
Maybe you dont want to read her story in black and white. Many viewers might not, after being made awaken to a widescreen ordeal. At any rate, Adrift is a classic requiem for all what Tami Oldham Ashcraft underwent in 1983.

From crisis to sustenance  Part 31:
Skillful organic and inorganic growth strategy opens door to increased opportunities
Organic growth of a business is what comes from a companys existing businesses, as opposed to growth that comes from buying new businesses. It is marked by increased output, customer base expansion, or new product development, as opposed to mergers and acquisitions, which are known as inorganic growth.
Businesses are able to achieve organic growth through proper growth planning and by selecting the best strategies available to them. For example, by examining Ansoffs matrix, businesses can select from market penetration, market development, product development and diversification to grow their revenue organically.
This type of growth is important because investors want to see that a company in which they are invested, or plan to invest in, is capable of earning more than it did the prior year - a feat that often reflects in a higher stock price or increased dividend payouts.
Inorganic growth can be desirable as long as it is being paid for with a companys cash, rather than debt or equity financing. A combination of both organic and inorganic growth is ideal as it diversifies the revenue base without relying solely on current operations to grow market share.
The mega retailers report comparable data on a quarterly basis to give investors and analysts an idea of their organic growth. For e.g., Walmart grew its comparable sales by 2.6% in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2017/18. It was a clear example of organic growth that Walmarts CEO attributed to accelerated sales (and increased demand) in the firms fresh meat, bakery and produce departments. In addition, the retailer said its eCommerce sales jumped 23% year over year.
However, with a large number of e-commerce-related acquisitions in the preceding years and quarters, this figure is not reflective of organic growth.
A risk analysis of organic vs. inorganic growth

If company A is growing at a rate of 5% and company B is growing at a rate of 25%, most investors opt for company B. The assumption is company A is growing at a slower rate than company B, and therefore has a lower rate of return. There is, however, another scenario to consider. What if company B grew revenues 25% because it bought out its competitor for $12 billion In fact, the reason company B purchased its competitor is because company Bs sales were declining by 5%.
Company B might be growing, but there appears to be a lot of risk connected to its growth, while company A is growing by 5% without an acquisition or the need to take on more debt. Perhaps company A is the better investment even though it grew at a much slower pace than company B. Some investors may be willing to take on the additional risk, but others opt for the safer investment.
Strategies
There are 3 strategies for organic growth and expansion: Intensive Growth, Integrative Growth and Diversification Growth.
(1) Intensive Growth
Let us look at the major intensive growth strategies. Igor Ansoff s matrix provides four different intensive growth strategies:
Market Penetration - the firm seeks to achieve growth with existing products their current market segments, aiming to increase its market share.
Market Development - the firm seeks growth by targeting its existing products to new market segments.
Product Development - the firms develop new products targeted to its existing market segments.
Diversification - the firm grows by diversifying into new businesses by developing new products for new markets.
The first strategy - Market penetration seeks to achieve three main objectives:
1. Maintain or increase the market share of current products  this can be achieved by a combination of competitive pricing strategies, advertising, sales promotion and perhaps more resources dedicated to personal selling. Secure dominance of growth markets.
2. Restructure a mature market by driving out competitors; this would require a much more aggressive promotional campaign, supported by a pricing strategy designed to make the market unattractive for competitors
3. Increase usage by existing customers  for example by introducing loyalty schemes.
Typically, this strategy is most effective when the overall market is growing,
The second strategy - Market development includes the pursuit of additional market segments or geographical regions. The development of new markets for the product may be a good strategy if the firms core competencies are related more to the specific product than to its experience with a specific market segment. Because the firm is expanding into a new market, a market development strategy typically has more risk than a market penetration strategy
The third strategy - product development may be appropriate if the companys strengths are related to its specific customers rather than to the specific product itself. In this situation, it can leverage its strengths by developing a new product targeted to its existing customers. Similar to the case of new market development, new product development carries more risk than simply attempting to increase market share.
The fourth strategy - Diversification is the riskiest of all four since it requires both product and market development and may be outside the core competencies of the company. In fact, this quadrant of the matrix has been referred to by some as the suicide cell. However, diversification may be a reasonable choice if the high risk is compensated by the chance of a high rate of return. Other advantages of diversification include the potential to gain a foothold in an attractive industry and the reduction of overall business portfolio risk.
(2) Integrative growth
This is a growth strategy in which a company increases its sales and profits through backward, forward, or horizontal integration within its industry. A company may acquire one or more of its suppliers to gain more control or generate more profits (backward integration). It might acquire some wholesalers or retailers, especially if they are highly profitable (forward integration). Or finally, it might acquire one or more competitors through acquisition (horizontal integration).
Backward Integration: A company engaged in production of a product may integrate, backward up to the sources of raw materials. This would ensure continuous supply of raw materials for the production processes of the company. The acquisition of a textile mill by a ready-made garments manufacturer is a case of backward integration.
Forward Integration: A company may decide to grow through forward integration with the distribution channels of its products. It may acquire certain distribution channels to have a greater control over the distribution of its products. The manufacturer of ready-made garments may take over certain retail shops to ensure ready market for his products.
Horizontal Integration: It takes place by merging of units engaged in manufacturing similar products or rendering similar services. That means competing firms are brought together under single ownership and management. For instance, if two or more sugar mills are combined under the same ownership, it will be a case of horizontal integration. The benefits of its type of integration are economies of large scale operations and evasion of unnecessary competition.
Conglomerate Growth: A company is said to follow the conglomerate growth strategy if is acquires another firm which is engaged in altogether different line business and is using different trade channels. In other words, it seeks its future growth through entering lines of business unrelated to its present market channels or technology. For instance a textile company may take over units engaged in chemicals, fertilizers, sugar, electrical equipment, etc.
Integrative strategies are usually considered when the intensive growth strategies have been exhausted and consist of Mergers and acquisitions. They are high risk and costly undertakings whereby 100 per cent success cannot be guaranteed to deliver on the value or efficiencies that were expected. These are therefore activities that need to be thought through carefully.
(3) Diversification
These strategies involve widening a companys scope across different products and market sectors. It is associated with higher risks as it requires the company to take on new experience and knowledge outside its existing markets and products. The company may come across issues that it has never faced before. It may need additional investment or skills.
On the other hand, however, it provides the opportunity to explore new avenues of business. This can spread the risk allowing the company to move into new and potentially profitable areas of operation
Typically, this strategy is utilized only after all other growth strategies within current markets have been exhausted as diversification can be very risky. The first three growth strategies can normally be pursued with existing core competencies. However, diversification requires organizations to acquire new skills, technologies and facilities.
The development or acquisition of new core competencies can be achieved through various methods, such as: strategic alliance or Joint venture, licensing or distributing or importing product or service lines produced by another company.
There are two major types of diversification: concentric and conglomerate.
Concentric diversification means the new venture is strategically related to the existing lines of business, while conglomerate diversification occurs when there is no strategic fit or relationship between the new and old lines of businesses.
If a company is considering diversification as a growth strategy it must be sure to utilize marketing research to minimize risk. Marketing research is essential because an organization needs to determine if customers in the new market(s) will potentially value and purchase the new products or services.
One must use creativity, experience and in-depth market understanding to evolve strategies that are logical and fact-based and which have the highest probability for success. And success is determined by the quality of strategic thinking and implementation capabilities.
By itself, the organic growth of a company does not mean much. Marketers must look beyond that to explore all integrative and diversification strategies to grow the business dramatically so as to achieve both bigger market presence and profitability.

SL to cultivate Cannabis in large scale for medical purposes
Since United Kingdom and Canada has lifted the ban for cannabis, now Sri Lanka can grow cannabis for medical purposes, export the production and earn millions of dollars. cannabis cannot grow in cold countries, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing media during a press conference held in Colombo yesterday he said that a Cabinet paper had been presented to cultivate Cannabis with the assistance of Armed Forces. Initially around 100 acres of cannabis will be cultivated.

Speedy  Rubik'S  cube juggler
It is estimated that less than 5.8 percent of the world's population can solve the Rubik's Cube. But one boy in China can solve three -- while juggling them -- in 5 minutes, 6 seconds.
12-year-old Que Jianyu demonstrated this talent last December on the set of Dream of China, a Chinese reality talent show, local news and entertainment site Shanghaiist reported on its Facebook page on Tuesday.
Christmas came early for the boy that day, when two judges from the Guinness World Records who were also present gave him recognition for the fastest time recorded solving three Rubik's Cubes while juggling them.
It's not the first time Que has been awarded the GWR. When he was seven, the boy set a record for being the youngest person to solve a 3x3 Rubik's Cube blindfolded. Que is also listed on the World Cube Association.
Que's talent has earned him popularity among children's talent shows, according to the South China Morning Post, which described his appearance on a children's talent show in Australia called Little Big Shots, where he solved three Rubik's Cubes using his hands and feet.

Sri Lanka seek share of spoils against West Indies
BRIDGETOWN, monday: A three-wicket burst at the start of the days final session put the West Indies in the ascendancy before heavy rain washed out the remainder of play with Sri Lanka at 99 for five in reply to the home sides first innings total of 204 after two days of the day/night third and final Test.
Shannon Gabriel, the wrecker of the Sri Lankans in the drawn second Test when he claimed a 13-wicket match haul, made up for a wayward and wicketless first spell with two successes while captain Jason Holder claimed the other to leave the tourists in a precarious position going into day three.
Roshen Silva and wicketkeeper-batsman Niroshan Dickwella will continue the Sri Lankan effort on the third day, weather permitting, as they seek victory to earn a share of the spoils in the three-match series at Kensington Oval in Barbados on Sunday.
Gabriel snapped a 59-run third-wicket partnership between Kusal Mendis and Danushka Gunathilaka when he bowled Mendis, Sri Lankas most prolific batsman in the series, for 22. Holder then accounted for Gunathilka, who had been reprieved just before the dinner break when dismissed off a Miguel Cummins no-ball, by trapping him LBW for 29.
Dhananjaya de Silva also fell leg-before to give Gabriel his 19th wicket of the series and the West Indies were pressing hard for more success before the threatening showers put an end to the night session of play.
Lahiru Kumara had earlier triggered a West Indies lower-order collapse with the last five wickets going down for 36 runs after they resumed from the overnight position of 132 for five.
Kumara, the fast bowler who has emerged as the tourists outstanding performer with the ball in this three-match series, broke the productive sixth-wicket partnership between Shane Dowrich and Holder which had frustrated the Sri Lakans on a rain-affected opening night as they rescued the home side from the depths of 53 for five.
Dowrich, who has enjoyed his best-ever series with the bat, highlighted by an unbeaten 125 in his first innings of the campaign in Trinidad, eventually fell for 71 on the second afternoon, trapped LBW by Kumara.
When Dowrichs demise was followed shortly after by the dismissal of Devendra Bishoo, taken in the slips off Kumara, the West Indies captain displayed an even more aggressive intent.
But it was to prove his undoing as Dilruwan Perera snared an excellent diving catch at gully to get rid of Holder for a topscore of 74 off Kasun Rajitha, who finished with figures of three for 68.
Perera got involved with the ball by having Cummins taken at short-leg as the West Indies tail showed none of the resilience that was in evidence earlier in the series.
Kumara polished off the innings by having Gabriel caught behind to lead the effort by the Sri Lankan bowlers with four for 68, raising his wicket tally in the series so far to 15.
Kemar Roach compensated effectively for Gabriels early inaccuracy by removing openers Kusal Perera and Mahela Udawatte cheaply at the start of the Sri Lankan reply. Then came the resistance from Gunathilaka and Mendis until the reintroduction of the ace fast bowler at the start of the final session brought the desired reward. AFP

Stop separating children
The issue of separating children from families has dominated headlines globally due to the zero tolerance policy on migrants in the United States. Since rescinded in Washington, the numbers are around 2000+.
What are some of the long-term issues these children might face
The younger you are when youre exposed to stress (the longer, more prolonged stress), the more likely you will have negative health outcomes caused by dysregulation of the stress response. If youre confronted with danger your body produces cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrineinflammatory hormones to protect and help you deal with dangeressentially allowing a fight-or-flight response. So your heart rate goes up, certain cortical areas shut down and you are able to fight back. When that happens over long periods of time and a child is constantly exposed to a threat, it leads to dysregulation of the stress response. The hormones are elevated and stay elevated, meaning they dont go back down to normal levels once that threat has gone away. So if you remove a child from a parent theres a constant threat for who knows how long, and that change in the dysregulated stress response leads to architectural changes in the brainwhich means that in the future children might end up with serious learning, developmental and health problems.
Theres a famous, 17,000-patient study called Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), which shows that adults who had more adverse childhood experiences are much more likely to have chronic medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, higher rates of cancer and a decrease in longevity. We dont know if these are going to happen to these children. But theres no reason that it wouldnt, so its really worrisome that the government is actually endangering the lives of children.
Child Rights Convention (CRC)
The Convention declares that children should not be separated from their parents against the will of the parents, except when there is a judicial decision that such separation is in the best interests of the child. This can occur because of abuse or neglect, or because of separation of the parents.
In the latter situation, the child should have access to both parents, even if in the care of one. The provision that this can be foregone if such is the childs best interests should be applied only in the event of a judicial decision.
The child has the right to have his or her views heard in respect of all matters affecting him or her, which would include the above. The Convention also asserts that the principle that both parents have common responsibilities for the upbringing and development of the child should be recognized.
What are we doing
A survey of Child Care Institutions (CCI) and the institutionalized children in Sri Lanka was undertaken by the National Institute of Social Development (NISD) for the Department of Probation and Child Care Services, sponsored by the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) 2013.
There has been a similar survey conducted ten years ago but it is clear that the reasons for the institutionalization of children have been drastically changed in todays social, cultural and economic context of the country. It states, it has become clear that children are institutionalized unnecessarily as a result of not considering institutionalization as the last resort for care and protection of children. However, since institutionalization of children does not ensure the best interest of children and have a negative impact on their development, well-being and future, it is important to provide care and protection for them within a family environment in all situations possible.
We have callously and recklessly without sensitivity pursued a practice in violation of our obligations under the CRC to institutionalize children using the Courts. If 2,000 was sufficient to upset a majority of citizens in the United States, 14,000+ being the second highest number after those in prisons in this country should make us feel ashamed of ourselves.
The medical answer to what we do to children having separated them ostensibly in the best interest of the child is in this article. The reality, therefore, is at 18 we release to society adults we have damaged due to apathy and gross lack of sensitivity to the emotional needs, thousands of children. Without naming and shaming several of our rights based institutions it suffices to say the State if needed can be asked to pay in the millions by way of damages.
The solution is not to separate but rather to mend relations, heal wounds and address the issues which cause grief and chaos within families.
Our officers in the Women and Children desks of the Police entrusted with marching to Courts with children and parents or probation officers tasked with reporting on family circumstances have the required expertise to reconcile and or find many of non-institutional options to stop separating children from families.
It though is not an alibi for our incompetence and failure to act in the best interest of the children in most instances. We have at the periodic under the Committee on the Rights of the Child at the UN stated, the Back to Home programme now covered the whole country, which is confirmation we have taken children away from homes.
****
Key findings
* There are 14,179 children in 414 institutions located in all nine provinces in Sri Lanka.
* Out of the total number of children residing in institutions at the time of the survey, 8,538 were females (60.2per cent) and 5,641 were males (39.8 per cent) indicating an overall sex ratio of 153.4 girls for every 100 boys.
* Although the children are referred to CCIs for a maximum period of three years, the majority of the children, both boys (40 per cent) and girls (37 per cent), have stayed on an average of 2-5 years in the CCIs. It is also required to make arrangements to send the child back to his or her family within three Years.
* 50 per cent of the children had a single parent whilst 32 per cent of them had both parents. However, 18 per cent (2,562 children) of children in CCIs had no parents and therefore were orphans.
* The percentage of abandoned children and abused children are 22 per cent and 14 per cent respectively which were the main two types identified in this category.
* Among 414 CCIs, 33 per cent had children with special needs.
* 23.9 per cent of male children and 20.7 per cent female children reported mental health and hearing difficulties.

We could do well to follow these recommendations given to us at the periodic review in 2018 which states:
Committee on the Rights of the Child Concluding observations on the combined fifth and sixth periodic reports of Sri Lanka, February 2, 2018.
Children deprived of a family environment
The Committee, drawing the State partys attention to the UN Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children (see General Assembly resolution 64/142, annex), emphasizes that financial and material poverty should never be the sole justification for removing a child from parental care, for receiving a child into alternative care or for preventing a childs social reintegration, and recommends that the State party:
(a) Ensure that families who are destitute are provided with the necessary means to provide care for their children;
(b) Support and facilitate care for children in their families of origin, including single-parent families, establish a system of foster care for children who cannot stay with their families, with a view to reducing the very frequent institutionalization of children, and implement mechanisms to expand and stimulate the reintegration of children into their families

Sri Lankan born Councillor Kairul Kareema Marikar was recently elected as the Mayor of Harrow Council from the West Harrowward, Labour Party. She is the first Sri Lankan to hold such a post. Having worked her way up, Marikar in a telephone interview with Daily News said no challenge was too difficult for a determined woman and that the basic rule of politics everywhere is to understand the plight of the common man.
Excerpts follow:
Q: Could you please give us a few highlights of your journey from working as a Food and Beverage Manger at Queens Hotel in Kandy to Harrow Council in London in 2010
A. I studied at Girls High School Kandy and went into catering as I lost a few marks to enter university. So I did hotel management and worked at Renuka Hotel as the House Keeping Manager and then at Queens Hotel as the Food and Beverage Manager. At the time I got a scholarship to Switzerland but I could not go because my mother did not approve. I was a woman and alone, she said. Unfortunately it shouldnt have happened, but I was the youngest and it happened.
Kareema as Mayor.
I got married through a proposal and moved to London in 1990. My marriage was not successful and I suffered through domestic violence. Because my mother selected him, she felt guilty. But I never wanted to show my sadness to the family and my mothers guidance was there for my three children. I do not regret my divorce.
I wanted a divorce when I just had only my daughter, but then the family did not approve of divorce and things and I had to go back to him. Finally, it came to a stage where I could no longer live with him, he thought with three children I would be scared to leave him, but I was actually happy to leave him. Then I did.
After my divorce I did many jobs, even worked at customer sales at Sainsbury (supermarket) and started studying nursing and mental health. At one point I even worked at the House of Commons Kitchens. It was then that in 2003, I bumped into my local MP, Harrow West MP Garret Thomas, I told him I had personal issues to discuss.
He asked me about many things about Sri Lanka, because I knew a lot about it and then he said why dont you join the labour party I took little steps, at the grassroots, planning of elections, etc from that day in 2003, after my divorce, I worked with the party, then they put me to contest a ward and I won it.
There was another Sri Lankan Muslim man in another ward and he told my aunty that he could not believe that I won. This is the mentality of our people.
Then I contested a second term. I want to do some good here.
Q: Do you still work in mental health
A. Yes, I still work as a mental health nurse. I balance my roster and when I am free, I work.
By 1995 my son was born, and I wanted to learn about healthcare to nurse my children and then I got interested in it and by 2010, I was fully qualified as a mental health professional.
Q: How was it getting into politics Did you take to it naturally
A. I am a peoples person. My father and uncle were politically involved, my brother is still a councillor in Kandy. We have that capability. I have won the hearts of my constituents. My ward was a Conservative ward but I made it Labour.
Q: How did you turn it to Labour from Conservative
A. Thrice a week, I went from house to house getting to know the people in the ward. You have six months to campaign, so I went from door to door and explained who I am and what I am. I personally, have gone through a lot, and I could connect with the common issues of the people. The Conservative candidate there I realized did not connect with the people, he was too high fly and did not understand them. I was sympathetic to the people, and I know the hardships of a normal single mum.
Q: How difficult or easy has it been managing such an ethnically diverse ward such as Harrow
A. We have in total 248,000 people here. Among them 20,000 are Gujaratis and 8,000 are Sri Lankan Tamils. We have 80 places of worship, 158 different languages spoken and are one of the highly religiously diverse boroughs. We are also one of the safest but we have a problem at the moment because of the Police cuts. There are people who are behaving badly. But we have made it clear that the council, police and myself will not tolerate any radicalisation, Islam or otherwise.
Q: Do you think that prejudices against female politicians are the same in both Harrow and in Sri Lanka If not what are the main differences for women contesting for public office
Kareema Marikar.
A. I learned about the 25 percent quota for women in Sri Lanka. Main challenge I think is from the leaders of the faith. The holy book has not said that women should not come forward and do this and that. The Muslim preachers have to understand that this is the 21st Century and you have to preach the religion in a peaceful and modern way. I am a Sri Lankan and my attire is the Osari (Kandyan Saree).
I used to wear the hijab but after the twin tower attack 9/11 in America, I was attacked because of it. So I read the Quran and it said that if there is a risk, you can remove it. So I did that. I am hoping to go back to it in future but not now because of my own safety.
As a Muslim, going into politics is not hard, but the Muslim male politicians should not put the women under the thumb.
In UK, politicians are more disciplined, but in Sri Lanka they are not. You need to go by the ethos of the country you live in.
Q: Do you think you would have gotten into politics if you were here Or would you have achieved the same success
A. No, because I was working as a Food and Beverage manager in Sri Lanka. My family was very broad minded, we were even called the Sinhala Marikkars because my uncle was the Post and Telecommunication Minister. I got a good education in Girls High School, but still there is a perception, Ah she is a woman!, that perception is still there in Sri Lanka.
I have many female friends there in good positions, but as a Muslim woman they will point fingers at you but you need to overcome that and take the country in the right direction.
It is a wrong perception. This is not the past, this is the future. My attire is the Osariya, and when I dont cover my head, people think I am a Buddhist. In London, I went to a school event in Osariya, there was a girl who asked me Oh you became Buddhist, that was wrong! A male politician wears the National to stand out but not us
Q: According to you, what are the most important aspects a local council has to focus on when serving its people
A. when you are in a local council, funding is a major issue. But any local council should go to every road and check what the real needs are. Go to and see about the road development, street lights, and develop the needs of the area; that should be the priority of the local government councillor. Regeneration and infrastructure development is important.
Then as a local councillor or MP, most important is, that you not misuse your powers. Not do things to benefit your family and yourself and not break the code of conduct.
Q: Since assuming office at the Harrow Council in 2010, you have progressively reached the pinnacle of local government, do you have any plans of entering national politics Do you eventually plan to enter the UK Parliament
A. I would like to. I meet up with my local MP, who I started my politics with. I have taught him that Sri Lanka is multi-cultural. The problem was that only the Tamil communities problems were heard loud, drowning out the rest. The voter base was more Tamil community so they had the monopoly within the Party. But after I joined, I am breaking the ice for all communities, and the MP of Harrow knows when I speak, I speak from the heart and I speak the truth.
If I get the opportunity, I will take it.
I would like to come back to Sri Lanka but doing politics in Sri Lanka is different, there has to be changes. There are people who live there who are saying they are fed up of living there.
Q: Any advice you might have for aspiring young Muslim female politicians in Sri Lanka
A. They should come forward, not just sit there and think of just cooking, eating and having children. They should come out and change the country for the better. Keep your culture and who you are and develop the country.
People cannot say politics is not good and do nothing. You have to go and raise your issues to the local councillor and make your voice heard. That is the way you go to sort out the issues.
So give your knowledge to the country and community and serve them.
Being felicitated at the local Sri Lankan association.

Twenty-three people die daily due to road accidents

Twenty-three people die daily due to road traffic accidents and nearly9000fatalities are reported annually due to the same, Non Communicable Diseases Unit Director Dr.ThilakSiriwardana said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Promotion Bureau (HPB) in Colombo he said that majority of deaths are reported due to accidents.
Providing a resolution he added that the media, especially radio channels can play a leading role in preventing accidents.
Traffic Police Division Deputy Director ASP W.D.A.Dhananjayasaid that annually around 3000 get killed due to road traffic accidents and one third of the total number of accidents related deaths occur due to road traffic accidents.
The low road discipline of Sri Lankan people is the main cause for road traffic accidents, he said.
By June 25 a total of 1459 individuals have been killed due to road traffic accidents. Annually 900 pedestrians die while attempting to cross the road.
Assistant Commissioner (Technical) of the Motor Traffic Department J.A.S.Jayaweera said that at the moment there are 7.1 million registered vehicles in Sri Lanka and 5.2 million of them run on roads.
The number of drivers can be similar. But the issue is 80 percent of them are not safe. Three wheels and motor bicycles are considered as unsafe vehicles. The people should be discouraged top buy those two types of vehicles.

Uruguay win group as Suarez inspires 3-0 win over 10-man Russia
Samara, Monday: Luis Suarez helped fire Uruguay into the last 16 of the World Cup as Group A winners on Monday after opening the scoring in their 3-0 win over host nation Russia, who had a man sent off.
A pinpoint free-kick from the Barcelona star and an own goal from Denis Cheryshev put Uruguay 2-0 up inside 23 minutes in Samara before Edinson Cavani added their late third in Samara.
Russia were reduced to 10 men after 36 minutes when right-back Igor Smolnikov was sent off for two yellow cards in a match that will be a reality check for a team that easily won its first two matches.
This is the first time Uruguay have won all three group games at a World Cup finals.
The South Americans will play their last-16 tie in Sochi this Saturday against the Group B runners-up, either Spain, Portugal or Iran.
Russia, who had sealed their spot for the last 16 before the match, will have the consolation of a days extra rest and huge support at Moscows Luzhniki Stadium when they face the Group B winners on Sunday.
Uruguay stamped their authority early in the group decider.
When Russian midfielder Iury Gazinsky fouled Rodrigo Bentancur on the edge of the area, Suarez expertly placed the direct free-kick in the gap between the out-stretched glove of Russias goalkeeper and the post on 10 minutes.
Uruguay doubled their lead when Diego Laxalts shot took a wicked deflection off the leg of defender Cheryshev and flew past the despairing Akinfeev on 23 minutes.
It was heart-breaking for Cheryshev, who scored twice in the 5-0 trouncing of Saudi Arabia in the opening game.
To compound Russias problems, Smolnikov was sent off after scything down Laxalt just eight minutes after his first booking.
Smolnikov, one of three changes from the team which enjoyed a 3-1 win over Egypt, was on the verge of tears as he trudged off with the home crowd stunned into near silence.
Russia coach Stanislav Cherchesov responded by taking Cheryshev off and slotting Brazilian-born Mario Fernandes into the vacant right-back berth.
Despite the numerical disadvantage, Russia had opportunities to get back in the game as they kept battling.
With 20 minutes remaining, the video assistant referee turned down Russian appeals for a penalty after Artem Dzyuba appeared to be elbowed in the face by Diego Godin.
Moments later, a badly-hit clearance kick by Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera was snapped up by the Russians and Dzyuba fired just over the bar from 14 metres out. AFP

Net interest income accounted for a 38% increase over the previous years figure, reaching Rs.2.7 billion from Rs.1.9 billion.
Operating profits for the year under review grew exponentially by 43% to Rs.1.9 billion from the previous Rs.1.3 billion. Net profit amassed to Rs.1 billion, growing by 40.3% on the back of outstanding performance built on prudent financial stewardship. Net profits for the previous year stood at Rs.726 million thus leading the company pass the billion rupee milestone in profits.

Meanwhile, assets climbed to Rs.38.4 billion from the previous Rs.30.6 billion, accounting to a growth of 25.2%. Vallibel Finance far exceeded the lofty ideals we set when we chose it to carry the groups name.

World Cup Group qualifying scenarios for knockout rounds
MOSCOW, Sunday: With the second series of World Cup group games completed on Sunday, qualification for the knockout rounds is now clearer.
The top two teams in each group go into the last 16. In the case of teams finishing level on points, FIFA has put in place seven tie-breakers starting with goal difference and then the number of goals scored in all group matches.
If two or more teams are equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings are determined as follows:
* points obtained in the group matches between the teams concerned;
* goal difference in the group matches between the teams concerned;
* number of goals scored in the group matches between the teams concerned;
* fair play points determined by red and yellow cards at the tournament.
* drawing of lots.
Here is where things stand in each group going into final round-robin matches.
GROUP A
Russia and Uruguay are through and all that is left to decide is who will top the group when they meet on Monday. Russia have a superior goal difference so a win or draw will send the hosts through as group winners to face the runner-up in Group B.
Neither Egypt nor Saudi Arabia have any points but with the Saudis shipping six goals, anything but a win will see them finish last.
GROUP B
Spain and Portugal sit top of the group on four points with Iran on three and Morocco eliminated with no points so far.
Spain and Portugal are also level on goal difference and goals scored and, since they drew, if their final results are the same the group could be decided by fair play points.
Spain have the advantage at the moment with one booking against the two of Portugal.
Portugal need at least a point from their final match against Iran to guarantee a place in the knockout round. Iran would secure their spot with a win and could also go through with a draw if Spain lose to Morocco.
Spain face winless Morocco with a point needed to guarantee progress.
The winner of Group B plays the runner-up in Group A, either Russia or Uruguay.
GROUP C
France, on six points, top the group and have secured passage to the next round but will need a point against second-placed Denmark (four points) in their final match to clinch first place. Denmark could finish first, second or third.
A Denmark loss coupled with an Australia win over Peru, who have yet to earn a point, could see the Socceroos sneak through on goal difference. Since Denmark and Australia drew, they too could be split by fair play.
Australia, with three yellow cards, currently have the edge in this respect on the Danes, who have four.
Peru have been eliminated but will finish third with a win.
The winner of Group C will meet second place in Group D
GROUP D
All sorts of outcomes are possible here with Croatia, on six points, through but the other three teams still in the hunt.
Croatia will top the group if they beat or draw with Iceland.
Nigeria, on three points, will secure their spot in the last 16 with a victory over Argentina, who sit bottom of the group on one point behind Iceland on goal difference.
A draw may also be enough for Nigeria even if Iceland beat Croatia, depending on goal difference.
To go through, Argentina need to beat Nigeria while hoping Iceland lose to or draw with Croatia. If Iceland and Argentina both win, to move to four points, they will be split by goal difference.
Iceland must win to have any chance but also need the other results to go their way.
The Group D winner will face the Group C runner-up.
GROUP E
Only one thing is certain in Group E and that is Costa Rica, without a point, will be going home.
Brazils last-gasp win over Costa Rica took them alongside Switzerland on four points, with Serbia on three.
Wins or draws for Brazil against Serbia and Switzerland against Costa Rica will send both through.
Serbia must beat Brazil to qualify but a draw could see them through if the Swiss are beaten by Costa Rica by more than one goal.
The winners of Group E face the second-placed team in Group F.
GROUP F
This was another group that changed dramatically after a stoppage-time goal as Germany, facing potential elimination, pushed themselves right back into the mix by beating Sweden.
Mexico, on six points, are in the driving seat, with Germany and Sweden both on three.
Mexico will qualify with a win or draw against Sweden. They can also move on with a loss to the Swedes if Germany lose to or draw with South Korea, who have no points.
Germany will go through with any win should Sweden fail to beat Mexico.
Another scenario could see Germany advancing on a better goal difference with a victory over South Korea even if Sweden beat Mexico.
Sweden can qualify with a win over Mexico and a Germany loss to South Korea. If both Sweden and Germany win it is possible for the Swedes to advance on goal difference.
Despite two losses South Korea still have a slim chance of advancing but they would need to beat Germany and hope both that Sweden lose to Mexico and that the goal difference goes their way.
The winner of Group F will meet the runner-up in Group E.
GROUP G
England and Belgium are guaranteed to progress but their finishing positions will be decided by their meeting on Thursday.
Both on six points, they have identical goal totals so a draw would mean top spot going to the best-behaved team. England are currently on two yellows to the three of Belgium.
Tunisia and Panama have no points ahead of their meeting, where a draw would secure third place for the North Africans.
GROUP H
Japan and Senegal will advance with draws against Poland and Colombia respectively. Should Senegal and Japan both draw with the same score, they will be split by fair play; Senegal have five yellow cards to Japans three.
Colombia will progress if they beat Senegal and a draw will suffice if Poland beat Japan. Poland have been eliminated.
The top two teams in the group will face either England or Belgium.

Lanka governed by Buddhist principles
Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said Sri Lanka does not require a military dictatorship because it is governed by Buddhist ethics and culture.
He said the development of the country depends on ensuring justice and equality rather than military dictatorship.
He said so during a programme to distribute sports equipment at Mirigama, recently.
We came to power to govern the country under the Yahapalanaya concept. We dont govern the country by killing and hurting people. No one is allowed to establish a military dictatorship in the country. As a Buddhist country, we have been following Buddhist ethics since birth. We are not in need of a military dictatorship, he pointed out.
We should stand against the people attempting to establish a Hitler leadership, disregarding races and religions. We should not be afraid to make decisions. When I was the Ports Minister, I was not afraid to sack thieves.
I followed the same principle in the Petroleum Ministry, too. The President and Prime Minister should take action against culprits. Thats what the country needs rather than a Hitler dictatorship, Minister Ranatunga added.

Legal approaches key to nutrition-based socio economic development
Secretary to the President, Austin Fernando yesterday told a South Asian forum in Colombo that legal approaches should be made to ensure that nutrition becomes a compulsory issue in socio economic development.
Delivering the key note speech at a South Asian roundtable forum on Putting the Lens on the Consumer in Nutrition-Sensitive Agriculture and Food Systems in South Asia in Colombo, Fernando said, It is the poor who suffer most from lack of nutrition.
Emphasis on agricultural systems will not automatically culminate the demands easily. It is easy for the rich to get attention for research, political patronage, and financial support even through multilateral, bilateral or national budgets and media. This could be countered by legal stipulations for compulsory qualitative improvements for nutrition and food systems. Law is not everything, but in our countries it can do a lot.
The forum to be concluded today would deliberate on some appropriate subjects on demand creation for nutrition in the food system by the poor, public private sector involvements and partnerships. It was organized by the South Asia Food and Nutrition Security Initiative (SAFANSI) together with the World Bank.
Development partners and donors are making nutrition-sensitive agriculture and food systems a central feature of their support of agriculture investment. In this exercise it is important to engage private sector collaboration to practice nutrition-sensitive agriculture and food systems, Fernando said.
He also emphasized on the political commitment and efforts to make agricultural policies and programs nutrition sensitive, particularly in the region.
In complex social and especially demographic spreads it appears a great challenge to face. Because, malnutrition rates remain alarming in the region it also has to be addressed seriously. Even in Sri Lanka, where the health indicators are among the best in the region, the nutrition indicators do not match with those, particularly the nutritional status of children, women and adolescents. It varies from district to district and even in certain areas based on the conflict situation we were faced with for a few decades.
When nutrition data are not in keeping with the overall socio economic development in the country it indicates a potential future risk for the health of the nation and development of the country. With a growing aging population the status will be made further complex.

Two companies favoured for tender
SriLankan Airlines Administrative Manger R. Ferdinands yesterday said the tender to supply duty free goods was offered to two companies for seven years without following proper procurement or tender procedures during former Chairman Nishantha Wickremasinghes tenure.
He told the Presidential Commission investigating into alleged frauds taken place at SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka that the tender to supply duty free items is renewed once in every six month, but these companies were offered the contract for seven years continuously under Wickremasinghe's administration.
He said that addresses and Board of Directors of the two companies were the same.
Ferdinands said that then administration had failed to include how these goods should be supplied to the SriLankan Airlines in the bilateral agreement.
The Commission chaired by retired Supreme Court Judge Anil Gooneratne met at the BMICH yesterday.
He said the supply of duty free goods had not been carried out properly after 2010, and the two companies that received tender to supply goods for 2011 had interacted with tender board members before the tender was granted.
Ferdinands showed the emails exchanged between the companies and the Tender Board members to the Commission.

On the brink, Argentina handed a final shot at World Cup salvation
SAINT PETERSBURG, Monday: Held by Iceland and humiliated by Croatia, Argentinas World Cup could already have been all but over, but Lionel Messi and the rest of Jorge Sampaolis troubled squad have one final shot at redemption against Nigeria on Tuesday.
Victory against the Africans, who Argentina have beaten in all four previous World Cup meetings, will secure qualification for the last 16 as long as Iceland dont shock already-qualified Croatia.
Even if Iceland claim a first ever World Cup victory, Argentina could still progress on goal difference.
However, bouncing back will take a huge improvement in performance and strength of character so far unseen from the two-time world champions in Russia.
The Argentina federation were even moved on Saturday to confirm that Sampaoli would continue for the final group game among rumours of a rift between players and coach.
I get the feeling theres a general anger at the heart of the team, said Argentinas legendary 1986 World Cup-winning captain Diego Maradona.
Im furious and very upset inside, because anyone who wore that shirt cant see it being trampled like that by a Croatian team that isnt Germany, that isnt Brazil, that isnt Holland or Spain.
For all his heroics with Barcelona at club level, Messi is still often compared unfavourably in his homeland for his inability to recreate Maradonas success for the national team.
Messi led Argentina to the World Cup final four years ago and consecutive Copa America finals in the following two years, but all three ended in defeat.
And his 31st birthday on Sunday only served to highlight how time is running out for Messi to win a major international tournament.
Without the five-time World Player of the Year, though, it is highly unlikely Argentina would even have qualified.
Messi salvaged a disastrous campaign under three different managers with a hat-trick away to Ecuador in the Albicelestes final qualifier.
In their hour of need, Argentina need Messis best once more.
Leo is fine, insisted veteran midfielder Javier Mascherano, who knows Messi better than most having spent eight years as his club team-mate at Barcelona.
He is a human being who has his frustrations because things havent worked out, but so are we all.
Like it our not, we are the runners-up from the World Cup and we have to show it.
So far in Russia, Messi has been held scoreless. He missed a penalty among 11 unsuccessful shots on goal in a 1-1 draw with Iceland before failing to make any meaningful impact in an error-strewn Argentine display against Croatia.
A month on from Messis rescue mission in Ecuador, he sat out a friendly as Nigeria beat Argentina 4-2 back in November to highlight how reliant even a squad containing Sergio Aguero, Gonzalo Higuain and Paulo Dybala remain on their number 10.
It is the most critical situation I have experienced, along with the Ecuador game, said Argentina midfielder Lucas Biglia on Sunday. But sometimes you have to cling to something.
Argentina are clinging to the hope their captain bails them out again.

Chorusing for a cause
For the past few months, there was music in the air for Sujatha Vidyalaya, Nugegoda. The Sujatha Vidyalaya choristers spoke the language of music, underscoring its ability to unite all universal realms. They not only had a rich experience at their debut participation at an international choral event, but also managed to bag both silver and bronze prizes at the Kuala Lumpur International Choir Competition (KLICC) 2018.
The event has been taking place in Kuala Lampur, Malaysia, for three consecutive years. The previous events were titled MICF 2016 and KLICC 2017. Choir groups from Malaysia, Indonesia, China and the Philippines took part in the event. The Sujatha College choirs represented Sri Lanka.
A friendship concert had started off the event on May 11. Then the senior choir competed in the youth category while the junior choir took part under the childrens category. There was also an open category at the event.
The choir which competed for the youth category had 21 members. The girls were divided into soprano and alto. Four altos comprised the choir while the rest sang in soprano. Around 22 choirs from different countries competed with them. The choir sang the songs When You Believe and Celine Dions Im Alive at the event. They had decided on those two because the songs and their beats were quite different from each other.
We got to know about the event through a parent who works at a travel agency. She sent us the information and encouraged us to take part. We too realized that this is a chance for the students to show their colours on international stage. So there was a lot of enthusiasm to take part, teacher in charge of Western Music at Sujatha Vidyalaya and Highlands College Tharanga Abeygunawardena said.
Speaking to the Daily News choir leader Uleena Udabage said that that the experience has been memorable as well as exciting.
We sang a Sinhala song - Bathiya and Santhushs Sri Lanka Matha for the friendship concert and that gave us a lot of confidence to face the actual competition. It was like a warm up round, she said adding that she has been a member of the choir from grade six.
We have done well at all island singing competitions too and had won many accolades. It was a different atmosphere at the international event. We were both nervous as well as excited to take part. However our experience in taking part in national competitions helped us adjust ourselves for the competitive nature of the event, she expressed.
Tharuki Ranasinghe says that they managed to learn a lot from KLICC.
We were able to watch the performances by other choirs and learn from them. Malaysia won the gold and Indonesia bagged the silver in the youth category. We were overjoyed that we managed to clinch the bronze. The Malaysian choir performed exceptionally and I was enthralled by their performance, she enthused.
Nimasha Panditharatna is in grade seven. She says that the practice sessions went on till around 7 am early mornings. They had also practiced during holidays because there had been very little time for preparations.
Besides singing I am into badminton. I have loved singing from childhood and have been in the junior choir from primary onwards. Some might think that being a part of a choir demands a lot of time. True, you have to be dedicated to it but there is time for studies and other extracurricular activities too if you plan properly, she opined.
Chirani de Silva notes that she would encourage other students to join a choir because it enriches ones life experiences.
They too can take part in international choir competitions and win like us. I was a part of the primary choir too, she said with a smile.
Enuri Jayasinghe says that the most challenging moment in the competition was when they sang Im Alive.
That was a tough one but we managed to pull it off in the end and impress the judges, she said.
Dulyaa Dissanaike Bandara advices choristers of other schools to work hard so that they can win anything.
Cooperation, team spirit and hard work helped us win the event. Our colleagues were overjoyed by our win and wished us well, she added.
The Sujatha Primary Choir comprises of 33 members who took part in KLICC 2018. They sang Somewhere Only We Know and Try Everything for the event. Six choirs from Malaysia competed in the Childrens Category along with the Sujatha Vidyalaya Junior Choir. Sujatha Vidyalaya Junior choir bagged the silver prize at the event. Nadeeka Bakmiwewa and Supushpi Jayasundara were the teachers in charge of the junior choir who went for KLICC 2018.
Most of us were new to the choir so we had to practice a lot. We were selected out of an audition. The teachers fine tuned our singing and we got to show our talents at the Sparkling Sujathians annual concerts, Junior Choir leader Senulima Dhananji Thirinamma said.
The Sujatha Vidyalaya choristers said that they would like to thank their principal Pushpa Kalubovila and all those who helped them in their path to success.

LTTE and ethnic conflagration in 1983
On June 20, in the article Whither Sri Lanka Economy - Part II, the following statement was included; ethnic conflagration in 1983 which was totally mismanaged by President JR who by not declaring an emergency for three days literally promoting the brutal murder of around 1,000 Tamils in Colombo and destroying their property. This gave rise to the birth of the LTTE .
Is this correct As everybody knows Prabhakaran who became the leader of the LTTE killed Mayor of Jaffna, Alfred Duraiappah in 1975. With a known history like that, why do some people continue to say the LTTE or the terrorism started due to 1983 incidents And if it is so, how many persons from Colombo and other areas who were affected by 1983 incidents joined the LTTE.
According to available records, almost all LTTEers were from the North and East.

Clinical Colombia send sorry Poles packing with 3-0 victory
KAZAN, Russia, Sunday: Colombias World Cup campaign roared back into life with a thumping 3-0 victory over Poland on Sunday which delivered a warning to their rivals and sent the disappointing Poles tumbling out of the tournament.
Defender Yerry Mina scored the opener in the 40th minute with captain Radamel Falcao and winger Juan Cuadrado putting the gloss on the Group H win with two goals in five minutes in the last quarter as the desperate Poles chased the game.
Midfielder James Rodriguez, winner of the Golden Boot at the last World Cup, returned to the starting lineup after injury and played a part in two of the goals as Colombia got back on track after their opening loss to Japan.
The victory puts the South Americans in third place in Group H on three points behind Japan and Senegal, who shared a 2-2 draw earlier on Sunday to move to four points apiece.
A Colombia victory over the Africans in their final first-round match in Samara on Thursday would secure a spot in the last 16 and keep them on target to at least match their charge to the quarter-finals in Brazil four years ago.
We were playing under the pressure of having to win and there could be no mistakes, said Colombia coach Jose Pekerman.
As time went by we managed to impose the quality of this type of football that we have. The team played as a unit in all its segments and the football emerged from this unity.
For Poland, the optimism fostered by their quarter-final spot at Euro 2016 and a strong qualifying campaign proved to be misplaced as prolific striker Robert Lewandowski drew a blank and they slumped to a second successive defeat.
Maybe thats all we could do. Lets be frank, its not like we lost by a whisker, said Lewandowski.
I was alone, we fought, I fought, I did everything I could, but fighting is not enough to win World Cup matches, you also have to have quality and we had too little of that.

Two constables attached to Nittambuwa Police have been interdicted for allowing two suspects, involved in a stabbing incident apprehended by residents in Thihariya and handed over to them, to escape from police custody, a spokesman for the Gampaha SPs office said.
He said two youths who arrived at a shop selling durian fruits in Thihariya had kicked up a row with the shop owner.
During the row, the shop owner had received a stab injury and he had been dispatched to hospital in a Suwa Sariya ambulance. Neighbours had flocked to the scene and caught the two suspect youths and alerted the police on the hotline.
Thereafter, they had handed over the two suspects to two constables who arrived at the spot. But the two suspects had escaped from police custody after using a ruse.
The neighbours had brought the matter to higher police officers. Gampaha ASP Mahinda Udugama, who held an initial inquiry into the matter, has ordered the interdiction of the two constables and intimated the decision to them on June 24.
Disciplinary action is to be taken against the two constables for bringing the police service into disrepute.

Crime and punishment
Ven. Galabodaatte Gnanasara Thera is the man in the news these days. He has eclipsed both the President and the Prime Minister as the chief protagonist in the media theatre or the theatrical media. Whatever he could complain of Ven. Gnanasara Thera cannot complain that he has received no publicity.
As is known he was convicted by the Homagama Magistrate for criminally intimidating Ms. Sandhya Ekneligoda, wife of a disappeared journalist in open Court. This verdict has led to a mass hysteria among a section of the Buddhist clergy and the laity. They cry foul and some even challenge the authority of the Court.
The controversy is more on the dress code of the prison. According to the law and practice convicted prisoners have to don a special dress called a jumper. All convicted prisoners have worn and are still wearing it. Among them at the moment are 15 members of the Buddhist Sangha. Nobody, not even the Maha Theras objected to the practice until Ven. Gnanasara Thera was convicted Why this difference
There was not even a whimper by either the Buddhist clergy or the organised laity when dozens of young Buddhist monks were arrested, disrobed and tortured by law enforcing authorities. Nobody spoke against disrobing Buddharakkhita and Somarama Theras convicted for conspiracy to assassinate Prime Minister SW R D Bandaranaike. Why this opposition only now The whole issue has become so knotty that only a sober analysis could establish what has happened and why.
Misleading devoted Buddhists
First, Ven Gnanasara Thera has committed a crime. Second, he has been convicted after a due legal process. Third, he is given the prison uniform to wear, according to law. This is the legal side. Fourth, any challenge to it could also be made legally by an appeal. This the Thera had done and is at large now on bail in his priestly attire.
What is abominable are attempts to forcibly change the verdict upturned by exerting pressure in the form of mass demonstrations and sit-ins etc. and misleading devoted Buddhists. The public should have a right to criticize verdicts of the judiciary and if the law is to be changed there is a legal procedure to be followed. It needs a revision of the law or a new law to be passed by the legislature in which the sovereignty of the people is vested. However, it needs a prior public discourse that is different from isolated groups with vested interests provoking people for agitation as is happening at this moment. The latter is a dangerous method that could lead to a breakdown of law and order and rule of anarchy. Prison officials are blamed for they are public servants doing their official duties. They cannot be faulted for it. The Sangha should not decide on state matters. They are free to give advice but not to interfere. The age of theocracy is past gone. Of course we understand that there are backward elements in our society who want to revert to theocratic of monarchial rule. We should overcome them.
The saffron robe of the Buddhist monks should not be allowed to be desecrated. True. But how does it happen How to prevent it One way to prevent is to disrobe known criminals such as convicted prisoners. On the other hand, if the long arm of Justice cannot touch the saffron robe criminals would don it freely to enjoy immunity from arrest.
Major crimes
Another argument of the learned and pious Maha Sangha is that it is unfair to convict Ven. Gnanasara Thera for a minor offence when others who committed major crimes are freely roaming the streets. There is no doubt they should also be convicted according to the law, if proved guilty. But if one is to wait till all persons responsible for major crimes are convicted there will be no conviction at all. Another question is why the venerable Sires failed to mention this fact when other persons were convicted for even lesser crimes, such as the conviction of a schoolgirl for stealing coconuts.
It was reported in the media that Minister Duminda Dissanayake, supposed to be a close confidante of the President has visited Ven. Gnanasara Thera in prison. We saw a picture of the Minister coming out of the prison gate with a beaming smile on his face. Now what was the message the visit signified No one would be wrong to interpret it as a sign of solidarity with the Thera. That would mean slighting the Judiciary and law enforcement officials who laboured to secure the verdict.
There is also talk of a presidential pardon. It was also hinted at a press briefing by a Minister. Again what message would such a pardon give What special reason is there to give a special pardon Of course, there are past precedents where Presidents have pardoned convicted murderers, rapists and other convicted criminals, some of whom later even got elected to the legislature. The people, however, do not wish the incumbent President to follow his predecessors on such matters. That is why he was elected over others.
It is also alleged that there is a conspiracy by NGOs and the international community against Ven. Gnanasara Thera, a strong defender of Buddhism. Even if it is so, who gave an opportunity to them None other than the Ven. Thera by abusing and threatening Ms. Ekneligoda.
Incidentally, we would like to be enlightened on the contribution of Ven. Gnanasara Thera to the preservation and development of Buddhism. Is it the hate speeches he delivered prior to anti-Muslim attacks in Aluthgama or his storming of Ministry offices or his general aggressive conduct
Finally, it must be mentioned that the noble Bhikkhus and their followers are playing a dangerous game that could ignite religious and ethnic hatred and lead the country to a catastrophe worse than that of July 1983.

Death penalty for homicide
Galle High Court Judge Manjula Thilakarathne, yesterday, imposed the capital punishment on a convict in a homicide law suit.
The convict, Kanda Kalasi Udaya Kumara alias Podi Pol of Rathgama, who was disclosed in court as a member of a gang of organized crimes, was thus given the death penalty.
The criminal, together with Naiduwa Handi Jagath Bandula and Naiduwa Handi Thusith Indula, had been indicted for homicide of Godawatte Liyanage Lalith Prasanna by shooting on October 13, 2001 at Palliyapitiya in Rathgama Police division. However, the other two suspects were acquitted and released as the prosecution failed to frame sufficient charges against them.
It was further revealed in courts that the convict sentenced to death penalty had been punished with a suspended jail term of 10 years RI and a fine of Rs. 10,000 as he was found guilty of an offence of keeping hand grenades in his possession by the Balapitiya High Court on September 26, 2011.
During the trail, it was also disclosed that the criminal was a bailed-out offender who had been indicted for homicide that occurred at Manimulla in Ambalangoda on August 12, 2011 and keeping illegal fire arms with ammunition in his possession.
Correspondingly, in another case, he had been indicted for an attempted murder of two persons by causing fatal injuries on April 14 2012 of which case extracts were sent to the Attorney General by the Galle Magistrates Court.
At the time of the declaration of the verdict, Sergeant Sunil represented Rathgama Police and State Counsel K.V. Indika prosecuted.

Destinys  Child in talks to record  Charlies Angels soundtrack
Destinys Child has reportedly been approached to record a song for the new Charlies Angels movie.
The legendary girl group topped charts around the world when they released Independent Women in 2000, which was first featured on the soundtrack to the Charlies Angels film starring Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu.
A new reboot being helmed by Elizabeth Banks is now in the works with Lupita Nyongo and Kristen Stewart both rumoured to be starring in the project, and a source has claimed that the studio is keen for Destinys Child to repeat history and create a new track for the feature.
Sony Pictures credits the groups smash hit, Independent Women, for much of the last movies success and is actively courting the group with hopes they will reunite to record another song for the forthcoming reboot, the insider told Metro.co.uk.
And though the source alluded that the trio - which consists of Beyonce, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams - are interested in the gig, the Survivor singers wish to open negotiations that will ensure they have autonomy over the project.
The group is open to a reunion but the delay has been caused by the fact that they would like complete ownership of their name and music as both are still owned by Beyonces father Mathew Knowles (who managed Destinys Child), the source explained. If they can come to an agreement that works for everyone the group will then begin talks with Sony about the soundtrack.
The three-piece are said to be especially excited about their potential involvement due to the possible inclusion of Lupita, who was first rumoured to be up for an Angel role last September.

Dogs  can be allergic to humans
Spring has sprung, and with the longer days and warmer weather comes one dreadful thing: Allergies.
Believe it or not, our pets can suffer from many of the same allergies that make us miserable. It is very rare, but they can even be allergic to you! Meet Cruella, the pup in the Ripleys family allergic to humans!
Ripleys Lead Researcher Sabrina Sieck adopted Cruella in 2014 and soon after, realized something wasnt right. It started with a mild skin irritation, progressed to constant itching and culminated into a nearly hairless puppy.
According to vets, she was healthy. Sabrina tried different diets, baths, and to keep her somewhat comfortable, Cruella wore a Lycra body suit. When none of it worked, allergy testing revealed Cruellas surprising diagnosis: Human dander.
Just like you can be allergic to cats and dogs, cats and dogs can be allergic to you!
The best way to combat this, in Cruellas case, was immunotherapy. All of her allergens were whipped up into a customized serum designed to desensitize her allergies, using proteins of the allergens themselves to slowly teach Cruellas immune system to tolerate people. Over about 6 months, Cruella was set! She still takes a pill on the day to day, but simply to manage her condition, just as you would a Claritin or Zyrtec.
Other Weird Allergies
Cruella is a rare case, but there are some other seriously strange allergies out there!
Water: Aquagenic uticaria is no joke! This allergy causes the skin to break out into hives whenever it contacts water. Severe sufferers may only be able to handle a few moments in the shower and be unable to drink a glass of water or even cry without pain. The good news is this typically only lasts a few years, not a lifetime.
Fish Smell: Yes, smell! If youre fish allergy is intense enough, even the smell of fish can cause a reaction. With a sniff, youre actually taking tiny particles into your nasal cavity. Notably flounder and hake are the smelliest culprits.
Food (like all of it!): Food allergies are common, but in 2009 we learned of Kaleb Bussenschutt, who is violently allergic to any kind of food or drink. Consuming anything would cause brutal ulcers to erupt in his stomach. Weirdly enough, Kaleb could eat ice and drink one specific brand of lemonade, but anything else was forbidden. Doctors are still stumped on this one. Ripleys

Dwindling water levels spell disaster for paddy cultivation
As a result of insufficient rains, the 2018 Yala paddy cultivation in Anuradhapura is in a quite backward position according to the data of the Anuradhapura Assistant Agrarian Development Commissioner Asanka Somawansa.
The number of farmers that have obtained the Yala fertilizer subsidy is 27,146 where the landscape under paddy cultivation is just 50,125 hectares. The 2018 Yala cultivation season is now reaching its end.
The initial plan that 88,000 farmers to be facilitated to cultivate 78,000 hectares have been an utter failure, Fertilizer Secretariats Anuradhapura Assistant Director Ajith Kumara said. He mentioned that so far only 3,500 mt of MOP, TSP and Urea fertilizer have been issued out of the quantity envisaged to be sold at subsidized rate was 25000 mt.
Anuradhapura Agrarian Assistant Commissioner said further that only under 25 percent of the 3,400 minor irrigation tanks come under his department in the district.
Quoting an example, he pointed out that in Kebithigollewa agrarian development jurisdiction, the irrigable landscape was 16,500 acres and only 20 acres have been cultivated in current Yala.
Somawansa said that in majority of 42 agrarian development jurisdictions, there has no paddy or additional food crops cultivation realized at all.
In the meantime it is reported that the water levels in the 13 major tanks in the district have been fast dwindling and under these tanks, out of the total irrigable landscape only 25 percent have been under cultivation.
The Anuradhapura District Farmer Organization has shown their utter displeasure over the decreasing number of drought relief beneficiaries from 141,000 families down to 48,426.

ERDOGAN WINS AGAIN
TURKEY: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has won tightly-contested presidential polls, the election authority said Monday, extending his 15-year grip on power as the opposition complained bitterly about the conduct of the vote count.
Turkish voters had for the first time cast ballots for both president and parliament in the snap elections, with Erdogan looking for a first round knockout and an overall majority for his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).
The stakes were particularly high as the new president will be the first to enjoy enhanced powers, without even a prime minister, under a new constitution agreed in an April 2017 referendum strongly backed by Erdogan but which opponents say grants autocratic powers.
Erdogan defeated his nearest rival Muharrem Ince with an absolute majority of more than half the vote without needing a second round, said the chief of Turkeys election authority, Sadi Guven.
I have been entrusted by the nation with the task and duties of the presidency, Erdogan said in a victory address at his Istanbul residence, vowing that the new presidential system would be implemented rapidly.
Turkey has given a lesson in democracy to the entire world, he added, pointing to an 88 percent turnout.
Erdogan won 52.5 percent in the Presidential poll while Ince, of the secular Republican Peoples Party (CHP), was on 31.5 percent, state-run Anadolu news agency said, based on a 99 percent vote count.
If confirmed, the figures would show Erdogan polling on a similar rating or even stronger than his 2014 election victory where he won his first mandate after over a decade as prime minister.
Celebrations erupted outside Erdogans residence in Istanbul and AKP headquarters in Ankara, with crowds of flag-waving supporters, AFP correspondents said.
Erdogan flew in triumph to Ankara where he held his traditional victory speech from the balcony of AKP headquarters at 3:00 am. The winner of this election is each and every individual among my 81 million citizens, he declared.
The usually loquacious Ince however remained silent, tweeting only that he would make a statement later on Monday.
Trailing were Selahattin Demirtas of the pro-Kurdish Peoples Democratic Party (HDP) with over eight percent in third and Meral Aksener of the nationalist (Iyi) Good Party with over seven percent.
Erdogan also declared victory in the Parliamentary election saying that the alliance led by the AKP and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) had won the majority in parliament.
A count of 99 percent of the votes showed that Erdogans AKP and the MHP would win 293 and 50 seats respectively, enough for an easy majority in the 600-member chamber.
The HDP was polling 11.5 percent, well over the 10 percent minimum threshold needed, to win 67 seats which would make the party the second largest opposition faction in the new chamber.
Celebrations erupted in the Kurdish-majority city of Diyarbakir, with people letting off fireworks into the sky, AFP correspondents said.
Its success is all the more remarkable given the HDPs Demirtas has campaigned from a jail cell after his November 2016 arrest on charges of links to outlawed Kurdish militants.
Erdogan had faced an energetic campaign by Ince, who has rivalled the incumbents charisma and crowd-pulling on the campaign trail, as well as a strong opposition alliance in the legislative poll.
But the CHP expressed unease over the conduct of the count, accusing Anadolu of being over hasty in publishing results that favoured Erdogan. Its spokesman Bulent Tezcan said Anadolu had published a count of over 90 percent of votes while in fact short of 40 percent had been counted.
Several world leaders supportive of Erdogan, including Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, called to congratulate him on his victory, the presidency said.
Erdogan also warned anyone against casting doubt on the results: I hope nobody will harm our countrys democracy by casting a shadow on the election system and its results in order to disguise their failure. Erdogan has overseen historic change in Turkey since his Islamic-rooted ruling party first came to power in 2002 after years of secular domination. But critics accuse the Erdogan, 64, of trampling on civil liberties and autocratic behaviour.
The President has for the last two years ruled under a state of emergency imposed in the wake of the 2016 failed coup, with tens of thousands arrested in an unprecedented crackdown which cranked up tensions with the West.
Erdogan has also campaigned against the backdrop of increasing economic woes including high inflation and a currency that has sometimes been in freefall.
And although Erdogan dominated airtime on a pliant mainstream media, Ince finished his campaign with eye-catching mass rallies, including a mega meeting in Istanbul on Saturday, that gave hope to the opposition. - AFP

France bank on slow-starter Griezmann to come good at World Cup
MOSCOW, Sunday: World Cup contenders France are waiting for star striker Antoine Griezmann to hit his stride as they aim to secure top spot in Group C against Denmark on Tuesday.
Griezmann signed an extension with Atletico Madrid through to 2023 last week despite strong interest from Barcelona, but the 27-year-old has yet to find his best form in Russia.
While he scored from the penalty spot in an opening 2-1 win over Australia, his sluggish start to the tournament mirrors his early travails at Euro 2016 where Griezmann finished as top scorer.
I think he will get stronger, I hope he does. That was the case at the Euros, he started slowly and finished very strong. Im not worried about him, said Chelsea forward Olivier Giroud.
Griezmann scored six goals as France finished runners-up to Portugal at the European Championship, clicking into gear as the competition progressed and netting five times in the knockout stages.
He has had a long, gruelling season. Hes played a huge number of matches, added Giroud, with Griezmann helping Atletico claim a third Europa League title.
When you have a bit less in your legs, its harder to be at ease on the pitch, but hes still very important for us.
Griezmann himself admitted there is room for improvement as France target a deep run at the World Cup.
Im going to get better and Im sure the level everyone expects, including myself, is going to come quickly, he told French TV channel TF1.
Didier Deschamps side are already qualified and would clinch first place with a draw in Moscow, a result that would also send Denmark through as runners-up irrespective of Australias result against Peru.
Bayern Munich midfielder Corentin Tolisso is keen to avoid Croatia in the last 16, even if finishing top could mean a blockbuster clash with Lionel Messis Argentina.
Croatia will come out of Group D, so above all we have to avoid finishing second to avoid meeting them, said Tolisso, who started the first game against Australia.
Between Nigeria, Iceland and Argentina, they are all good teams. We know the Argentines have very strong individuals, notably Lionel Messi, he added. You never know whats going to happen in a match. But we know the last 16 will be difficult, regardless of the opponent.
Second-placed Denmark beat Peru 1-0 in their first game before a 1-1 draw with Australia to extend their unbeaten run to 17 matches.
Age Hareides side are looking to reach the latter stages at a World Cup for the first time since 2002.
France may be considered among the favourites and have six points but they have not been finishing off opponents, Hareide told Danish newspaper bold.dk. They have been pushed to the wire to get the points.
They played well in the friendlies, but have not played well so far in the World Cup, he added.
Yussuf Poulsen is suspended after he collected a second booking in as many outings against Australia, the forward picking up a harsh yellow card following a VAR-awarded penalty.
Denmark are hopeful midfielder William Kvist will return at some stage after breaking two ribs and suffering a punctured lung against Peru, although it wont be in time to face France.  AFP

Galle to become South Asian hub of Tourism  PM
The foremost objective of the Tourism Police is to transform the Galle region as the tourist hub of South Asia, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Galle.
He was addressing a forum on the Development Plan for Galle and its suburbs, held on Sunday at the Galle Fort Marine Museum premises.
All illegal constructions within the Galle Fort should be removed and state organisations located in the Fort area shifted without delay. However, no destruction should be caused to Galles heritage in the process, the Prime Minister further stressed.
Galles New Development Plan with the aim of promoting tourism should be implemented while preserving and protecting the precious World Heritage Site of the historic Galle Fort. No fortifications should be permitted according to the whims and fancies of individuals or organizations.
Even government institutions should follow the provisions of the new City Development plan in making alterations to any existing buildings and in new constructions, he further observed.
He also requested the officials to list out the state organisations which have informed their readiness to shift from Galle Fort and specially instructed them to initiate the respective course of action according to a fixed plan. Prime Minister also stated that illegal constructions at the Galle International Cricket Stadium should be also removed, accordingly.
Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Rathnayaka said that many of the government establishments in Galle Fort have asked for further dates to shift their organisations from the Fort.
However Prime Minister Wickremesinghe reiterated the need of expediting the process.
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardana, Land and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Gayantha Karunathilake, Sate Minister Piyasena Gamage, Galle District Parliamentarians Wijepala Hettiarachchi and Bandulala Bandarigoda and a host of government officials participated at the occasion.

Inquiry into Pugollagama archaeological site damages
GN, four NHDA officials interdicted
The inquiry made into the alleged damages caused to archaeological monuments in a land at the Pugollagama village in the Ipalogama Divisional Secretariat division of the Anuradhapura district, while carrying out land-clearing activities to accommodate a housing scheme provided by Anuradhapura Government Agent (GA) R. M. Wannainayake, had concluded recently.
Under the instructions of Government Agent Wanninayake, the additional government agent (land) held the inquiry, which was primarily against the Ipalogama Divisional Secretary. The Grama Niladhari involved in the incident had been interdicted along with four Anuradhapura National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) officials.
Investigations revealed that when written instructions were provided by Irrigation Minister Duminda Dissanayake to the Ipalogama Divisional Secretary on April 4, to suspend further proceedings of the housing project as there were concerns raised regarding the selection of beneficiaries, the Divisional Secretary had informed the NHDA to discontinue the project temporarily. However, the Grama Niladhari in the division had not been notified regarding the matter. Subsequently, Anuradhapura District Parliamentarian Chandima Gamage had laid the foundation stone for the housing scheme on April 9. The project had then continued from April 9 to 11 and again from April 17 to 19 sans the supervision of government officials. It was revealed that the Puliyankulama Grama Niladhari was transferred to the Manewa division following the foundation stone-laying ceremony.
The new Grama Niladhari who had reported for duty at Puliyangkulama was not informed regarding the housing scheme as well as the archaeological reservation site in the division. It had been further disclosed that only on April 25, the Ipalogama Divisional Secretary had summoned the Grama Niladhari said that while clearing the land, the Pugollagama archaeological monuments had been damaged.
Thereafter, Archaeological Department officials inspected the site and lodged a complaint at the Ranajayapura (Ipalogama) Police Station. Police said that as a report had not been submitted by the Archaeological Department regarding the damages, the inquiry file would not be submitted to the Attorney-General for further instructions. Speaking on the case against the offenders, the Anuradhapura government agent said the damages were caused due to negligence, lack of coordination and poor supervision, adding that he had instructed the 22 Divisional Secretaries in the district to not release land for any development project without obtaining recommendations from all stakeholder agencies and notifying divisional development committees and the district land utilisation committee, as such procedures were compulsory.

Gota questioned by FCID
Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa visited the FCID yesterday and gave a statement following an order issued by the Court of Appeal regarding a complaint made against seven people including him for the alleged misappropriation of several millions rupees of funds belonging to the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation for erecting a mausoleum and a museum in memory of his late parents. The recording of Gotabhaya Rajapaksas statement lasted for about two hours. The FCID has already recorded statements from the other six persons from time to time.
The Land Reclamation and Development Corporation also functioned under the Defence Ministry.
The FCID had received a complaint alleging that millions of rupees belonging to the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation had been spent on refurbishing the tombs of Gotabhaya Rajapaksas late parents D.A. Rajapaksa and Mrs. Rajapaksa at Medamulana and for building a mausoleum with an appropriate surrounding and a museum despite the Corporation functioning on borrowings.
The FCID after conducting investigations into the complaint inspected the said mausoleum and relevant files at the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation after questioning and recording statements from relevant officials there.
Thereafter, the FCID also recorded a statement from Gotabhaya Rajapaksa too and submitted a report to the Attorney General for taking legal action under the Public Property Act against seven persons including Gotabhaya Rajapaksa for alleged misappropriation of millions of rupees belonging to the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation.
Meanwhile, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa submitted a Writ Petition Number 391-2017 in the Appeal Court seeking an order preventing his arrest saying the charges made against him did not come under the purview of the Public Property Act.

While people in todays development countries were living in Caves with limited facilities, our ancestors were even exchanging Ambassadors and Trader representatives with Egypt, Rome and China which were very developed during that time. There were also two international harbors in Mannar and Hambantota, the Minister said. He also disclosed that Ceylon had also given a credit facility to one of the traders in 300 BC.

Govt. aims to achieve prosperous, happy citizenry: Minister Ranawaka
The aim of the government is to achieve a happy citizenry of an economically prosperous and socially equitable nation, living with perfect harmony with the natural environment, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, yesterday.
He said the government is working towards this dream that can be realized in the foreseeable future. He added that the Western Megapolis is simply a grand plan to develop the entire Western Province as a single Megapolis to achieve the status of a high income, developed nation by 2030.
He made these observations yesterday, delivering the keynote address at the opening ceremony of the four-day FIDIC-ASPAC Conference 2018, held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH).
The minister said leading American scholar Robert D. Kaplan in his book titled The Monsoon said that the world stage is well-set for the re-emergence of the Monsoon Asia as the global economic powerhouse as well as the geopolitical theatre of action.
The minister said as Sri Lanka is in the middle of the region, it has a potential for a Megapolis in South Asia. The government has a vision to make the Western Megapolis one of the top 10 most livable cities in Asia.
The minister said the guiding philosophy of development is holistic and inclusive and based on economic growth and prosperity, social equity, environmental sustainability and individual happiness.

Grandmaster in a flash: Indian prodigy chess champ at 12
NEW DELHI, Monday: A 12-year-old Indian boy described as unstoppable by his proud father has become the worlds second youngest chess grandmaster ever.
Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa, the son of a bank employee from the southern city of Chennai, achieved the feat with some aggressive play at an event in northern Italy that ended Sunday.
Praggnanandhaa -- whose 17-year-old big sister Vaishali Rameshbabu is also no slouch at the game, being a two-time youth chess champion -- was aged 12 years, 10 months and 13 days when he won the title.
But this was too old to beat the current record-holder, Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine, who was 12 years and exactly seven months when he made the grade in 2002.
Praggnanandhaas father said that his son, who practises six hours a day and watches past matches online, was not even four when he first started taking an interest in chess.
However he said that the family could not afford to pay for extra travel and training for both the boy and his sister.
But the passion in him to play chess was unstoppable, I had to give in and put him in coaching classes. And he has been unstoppable since, the 53-year-old, who has the same name as his son, told Indian media.
He was just six years old when he came second in the under-eight national championship. That is when I knew that I cant hold him back because of our financial situation, he told online paper The News Minute. A predecessor to chess is thought by some to have originated in India in the sixth century AD, from where it spread to Persia and developed into the Game of Kings it is today.
However in modern times it only achieved major popularity in India when Vishwanathan Anand became the countrys first grandmaster aged 18 in 1988 and dominated the game in the 2000s.
On Sunday the five-time world champion congratulated Praggnanandhaa.
Welcome to the club & congrats Praggnanandhaa!! See u soon in chennai, he wrote on Twitter.
He plays other outdoor sports too when he wants to relax his mind, the prodigys father said.
When his focus is not on the board, he is quite a handful. But he saves most of his aggression for the chessboard, he said. AFP

## Title: Importance of Financial Reporting for Transparency

Importance of Financial Reporting for Transparency
Bushman, Piotroski and Smith (2003) identified that the availability of information was considered to be a key determinant of the efficiency of resource allocation decisions and growth in an economy. Availability of information is linked to corporate transparency, defined as the widespread availability of firm-specific information to those stakeholders outside the firm. Corporate reporting plays a significant role in facilitating corporate transparency.
Corporate reporting involves periodic dissemination of firm-specific information. This could be either voluntary or mandatory or a combination of both. Three broad aspects can be identified with regard to corporate reporting: (1) financial disclosures; (2) governance disclosures; and (3) the audit quality of these disclosures. This article will address the financial disclosure aspect of transparency and considers its drivers: the accounting principles used to recognize and measure financial disclosures; and its timeliness together with the audit quality pertaining to financial disclosures.
Transparency and GAAP
Financial statements have got the highest importance for any sort of business. In fact one could say that the financial statement is the summary of the whole years performance. A financial statement is prepared in the transparent way as its a source which will attract the investor and create desire among them for making an investment in that company.
Transparency in financial statements means that the statements should be user-friendly and clear, and everything should properly be disclosed. Companies that understand the importance of transparency and financial reporting are also well informed about the psychology of the investors. A complex and opaque financial report gives little understanding about the true risks involved and real fundamentals of the company. One main concern while preparing the transparent financial statements, therefore, is that it should be interesting and easily understandable. The use of hidden entries and complex accounting and financial terms should be minimised and both favourable and unfavourable sides should properly be elaborated.
While making the financial statements transparent, one also have to ensure whether they are in compliance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In the Sri Lankan context GAAP comprise the Sri Lanka Financial Reporting Standards (SLFRS) promulgated by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) which are virtually the same as International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Consequently, compliance with SLFRS makes the financial statements easily understandable internationally.
Agency Problems and Financial Reporting
Resolving agency problems is integral to corporate governance and transparency. Two types of agency problems can be typically identified in the corporate world. The first is that the interests of the board of directors and shareholders are aligned but the interests of management are not. The second type is that the interests of the board and management are aligned with each other but their interests are not completely aligned with the interests of shareholders.
These agency conflicts are reduced through both formal and informal measures. Formal measures include corporate charters, employment contracts, listing requirements and other regulations whereas many important governance functions are carried out via informal measures.
According to research findings by Verrecchia (2001), managers typically have better firm-specific information than non-executive directors and shareholders, but they may not always truthfully report information that is detrimental to their personal interests, such as information about poor performance or their consumption of private benefits. Boards, which largely consist of non-executive directors, and shareholders, are therefore typically assumed to be at an informational disadvantage when monitoring managers.
Thus, one important role for financial reporting is to provide non-executive directors and shareholders with relevant and reliable information to facilitate their mutual monitoring of management and, in the case of shareholders, their monitoring of directors.
Qualitative Characteristics in Financial Reporting
The Conceptual Framework for SLFRS identifies qualitative characteristics which enhance the usefulness in financial reporting to ensure high level of transparency in the above context.
Relevance (the need to disclose all material information) and faithful representation (the need to provide complete information which are neutral and free from error) are considered fundamental to the quality of financial statements.
The Conceptual Framework further identifies four other characteristics which are considered to enhance the usefulness of financial information: (1) Comparability (ability to compare with the past information of the company and with the information of the other companies in the industry); (2) Verifiability (Ability of different knowledgeable and independent observers to reach consensus); (3) Timeliness (provision of information at the right point in time to influence decision making); (4) Understandability (Ability to understand information with reasonable effort).
Independent Audit
The above characteristics will support the users to mitigate the agency conflicts thus increase the degree of transparency of the activities taking place in the company. Other than making the financial statement with proper elaborations and making it reader friendly, it is necessary to ensure completeness of the transactions leading to each of the figures and they are truly recorded in making the financial statement transparent. An independent audit will add value by improving the process as high level of auditing and cross checking ensures compliance with GAAP and true and fair presentation of the financial statements.
The recent addition to the Auditors report requiring disclosure of key audit matters and mitigation of audit risks arising therefrom can be considered as another step forward to enhance transparency of financial reporting.

Ivory Icon
Pasquelge Don Augustine Ivor Dennis made his radio debut in the 1950s. Dennis took part in a song competition of the then Radio Ceylon. He sang one of the famous notes of the time: Sunil Santhas Waren Heen Sare. No one dared challenge Sunil Santha who was a living legend in his own time. The maestro was confused this time. He could not make out whether it is his voice or not. If not for a small variation, the maestro would have dismissed what he heard over the radio as his own.
Once he detected that the voice does not belong to him, Sunil Santha wanted to discover and explore the origin. He discovered the Romen Catholic singer hailing from Seeduwa. That discovery led to a budding relationship between a master and a disciple.
The 1950s was an amazing decade. It was the decade that introduced originality to the rising national identity. The Bandaranaike government introduced the Sinhala-only policy. Dr Lester James Peries made an attempt to Sinhalise the cinema. Rekhava and Sandesaya are an offshoot of that attempt. In parallel with Lester James Peries, we cannot forget Sunil Santha. And in parallel with Sunil Santha, we cannot forget Ivor Dennis, for he carried on the formers legacy this far.
On various occasions, Sunil Santha recommended his disciple. In such a backdrop, Ivor Dennis had the rare opportunity to come forward. He stood for Sunil Santha on numerous occasions. He travelled overseas (such as Japan, India, Indonesia, Italy, England and New Zealand) as well representing the leading singer of Sri Lanka. He was recognised for his vocalist capacity in a singing competition at the Asian Broadcasting Union in New Zealand in 1986. Yet he never overlooked the nitty-gritty of the career. Dennis received training as a playback singer.
Come 1958, and Ivor Dennis received his appointment as an A grade singer. As the recipient of the Best Singer for Hima Kathara film, Dennis made a lasting impression in the film music industry with his contributions to cinematic works such as Madhura Madhu, Pancha Madhura, Ran Walawa and Seegiri Gee.
Dennis is well known for his music composed to Kurulu Paradiseye written by Thilak Sudharman Silva. Leslie Botejus Abhimananeeyavoo Navodeye Hiru also elevated Dennis to an upper echelon. With that fame, Dennis launched his cassette titled Abhmana Gee in 1984.
Dennis was now gathering momentum in the industry. He was made Consultant to the Government College of Music. That position enabled him to work with another batch of greats such as WD Makuloluwa and Premasiri Khemadasa. His association with Khemadasa is noteworthy for any student of the Khemadasa chapter of Sri Lankan musicology. Dennis was often a standalone voice of the Khemadasa musicals. A number of notable works include Raja Weda, Pirinivan Mangallaya and Manasawila. Both Khemadasa and Dennis illumed beyond horizons thanks to each other.
If Sunil Santha played a pivotal role in bringing Ivor Dennis out, Fr Marcelline Jayakody did an equally instrumental role. Dennis stepped into the vocalists pedestal with the church music. He sang the songs of Fr Marcelline Jayakody and Fr Moses Perera (whose nephew happened to be Sunil Santha).
Ivor remained faithful to Sunil Santha as his ever obedient disciple. Dennis could be deemed as the leading Catholic singer of the country owing to his immense contribution. Following his music composition to Fr Moses lyrics, Dennis then went on to join the Pubuduwa in 1974 in order to syringe a new episode to the musical prayers. Two cassettes, Ape Pavulen Oba Mahimaya and Obe Wethi Rajindo, were launched as a result. Dennis shouldered the challenging task of composing music to all the tunes. All this paved the way for him to be the recipient of the OCIC award in recognition of his service to the Catholic music.
The Rasanjalie Kala Kavaya, an art circle, is a brainchild of Ivor Dennis. The art circle flourished with the participation of several leading figures such as Jackson Anthony, Ralex Ranasinghe, Leslie Boteju, Tony Ranasinghe, Kumarie Munasinghe, Malkanthie Pieris, Joe Dambulugala, K Francis, Alexis Fernando, Francis Horana and Anthony Molligoda. Dennis also sang for the songs of Fr Cyril Gamini.
Ageing did not distract him. He was very much involved in his territory. Like he was an obedient disciple to Gurudev Sunil Santha, Dennis could also produce a generation of skilled disciples.
He will be etched in our memories not only as the most outstanding disciple of Sunil Santha but also the leading vocalist of an unusual combination (patriotic songs and hymns).
Ever thought of how you could get rich and famous in a fortnight Play cricket No. For that, you have to be a male and have a hair-do similar to a crows nest made of pieces of straw. The easiest way to become a demi god these days is to get selected as a superstar, singing other peoples songs. Is this plagiarism Is this wrong No. Not when it happened in the past. Aditha Dissanayake penned these sentiments a few years ago.
Her opinion is noteworthy given the fact that most upcoming singers choose the songs of the veterans to climb the ladder of success. With Dennis, the story is different. As Dissanayake places on record, most of the incumbent generation would not have been familiar with Sunil Santhas famous notes of the 1950s if not for Ivor Dennis.
Ivor Dennis was not into plagiarism. He was the godsend to carry on the Sunil Santha legacy for posterity.

Kane, Buttler and Hamilton star on great weekend for English sport
MANCHESTER, Sunday: Harry Kane's World Cup hat-trick was the centrepiece of an extraordinary weekend for English sport as the men's football, rugby union, rugby league and cricket teams all triumphed, Lewis Hamilton took the flag at the French Grand Prix and golfer Matt Wallace won the BMW International Open in Germany.
The England rugby union team got the ball rolling on Saturday as they ended a run of six straight defeats, including five in full internationals, with a 25-10 victory over South Africa in Cape Town.
The three-match series may have already been lost, with England kicking-off 2-0 down, but six penalties from the boot of stand-in skipper Owen Farrell helped the side end their worst run under Australian coach Eddie Jones, while recalled fly-half Danny Cipriani provided the accurate grubber-kick that set up Jonny May's try.
Later on Saturday, England's rugby league side beat New Zealand 36-18 in a ground-breaking match in Denver designed to raise awareness of the 13-a-side code with US sports fans.
Elliott Whitehead scored two tries and debutant Jake Connor scored one and set up two more.
The run of sporting success continued on Sunday, with England easing into the last 16 of the World Cup with a 6-1 rout of Panama in Russia.
Kane bagged a treble, John Stones scored twice and Jesse Lingard struck a fabulous goal, with England 5-0 up before half-time in what was their biggest-ever victory at a World Cup.
All six goals received raucous cheers at the other Old Trafford -- Lancashire's headquarters rather than the Manchester United ground of the same name -- where England were playing Australia in a one-day cricket international.
England were facing defeat at 114 for eight, but Jos Buttler's unbeaten 110 saw them to a thrilling one-wicket win and a first-ever 5-0 series sweep of world champions Australia.
Elsewhere defending champion Hamilton returned to the top of the Formula One standings by leading from start to finish to win the French GP.
It was a first victory in the race for four-time world champion Hamilton, who was aided by Sebastian Vettel's opening-lap crash with Valtteri Bottas at the Paul Ricard circuit.
By contrast, Wallace came from two shots off the lead to hit a final round seven-under-par 65 to win by one stroke in Pulheim.
Wallace was already in the clubhouse when both Martin Kaymer and Mikko Korhonen failed to equal his four-round total of 278.
The duo had to settle for a share of second place along with Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen, whose record-breaking round of 61 could not deny Wallace victory. - AFP

The latest ecstatic,  elastic rubber-band contraband!
My column last week titled the The sling, the zing and the sting elicited quite a bit of response from a few of the last living colleagues of that era. I received a buzz from D. P. Wicks, who astoundingly is still part of the editorial, who witnessed the shenanigans chronicled in the column.
DPW who we affectionately referred to as Wicky, called and regaled me with more stories about the sharpshooter nicknamed Jules featured in the last column. Wicky was, and doubtless still is, the most concise and articulate Sinhala-to-English translator I have ever encountered, anywhere. He was an asset to the editorial and his cheerful disposition was equally appreciated by his colleagues driven by stressful deadlines.
Wicky should know, because he sat literally cheek-by-jowl to Jules desk. Despite his unobtrusive presence, Wicky was afforded a ringside seat to observe closely the rascality that emerged when Jules stretched his luck too far with his obsessive rubber-slinging larks.
Wicky, amid gales of guffaws recounted the several violent theatrics that did emerge culminating in some pretty good punch- ups  a rather jolly good outbreak of old newsroom furore.
Rubber band shooting may have been a snap for the trigger-happy rubber slinger until that ominous day when two of his victims snapped back. Wicky says amid more infectious laughter: Jules did not realize that some people were like rubber bands, willing to stretch but eager to snap back into place at the first opportunity.
One would have imagined that the full-scale action drama that ensued would have weaned Jules of his compulsive preoccupation for life following a huge altercation where he was used as a punching bag. But not Jules, who carried on regardless in the same vein of a zillion rubber bands in his resilience.
As I mentioned in my last column as children and also as incorrigible adult delinquents, most of us tried making a rubber band gun out of our fingers, making for hours of fun. Making an impromptu rubber band hand-zinger was also educational learning as to those aspects of physics such as tension and torsion. We learnt to maximize the slinging power of the rubber and to observe that there are limits to how much force can be applied before its structural integrity is compromised. I have found that I achieve the best results when I dont try too hard to aim before releasing the projectile. Through constant practice you will develop the necessary muscle memory and instinctive aim for taking fast shots as they present themselves.
Another feature that this technique provides, beyond accuracy, is auditory. People will hear the sound of air being displaced as the rubber band passes them  its impressive and a little bit scary. You could liken it to a giant mosquito whizzing past your ear.
It is sometimes best to miss intentionally. Flinging a band, for instance, and hitting your target spot-on is not as effective as hitting an object close to him. The very sound of a clip twanging against a convenient target close to his ear, such as a computer screen, unnerves the victim far more than if it had actually struck him physically.
This will allow you to engage in a shock and awe campaign that will ultimately identify you as a force to be reckoned with. Well, you probably wish elastic precision was around when you were a kid because they are making some seriously awesome, highly precise rubber band guns that look like they would fare well on the battlefield.
So what it really means is that no more firing rubber bands at office mates one at a time, while aiming with your index finger.
You might be too old for that sort of horseplay now  or hey, maybe you're not  but you won't be able to resist the old-school style of the Model PPK and Model Rubber Band Guns. James Bond has probably never stumbled into a rubber band fight, but on the off chance he did, the PPK would be his weapon of choice.
Modelled after 007's own handgun and made with hard maple and walnut, it's easy to load, solidly built, and capable of semi-automatically firing five consecutive rubber bands at up to 20 feet. As we said its your license to sting.
The PPK model crafted from solid wood is easy to load and fires five bands at up to 20 feet. The PPK is the perfect size for teens and adults, making this the lethal combo to unveil your inner James Bond.
In all likelihood, this rubber band gun wouldn't stand a chance against Ernst Stavro Blofeld or Goldfinger, all Bonds super-villain adversaries. But seeing as though it comes with 50 rubber bands, it'll at least keep you amused for hours. Whether you're tormenting your enemies or enforcing elastic justice, you won't find a better tool for the job.
Certainly mankind has moved a step forward to the future and a step away from the past when writing was developed. Now ideas could be preserved for all time. Another leap forward in our collective evolution was when the first wise-ass realised that rubber bands could be stretched and shot at coworkers. Such fun! The time has come, children, to combine these two great leaps of development into one awesome little toy. The Rubber Bandit Rubber band shooting pen is just that toy.
It looks like a pen. By jove, it is a pen! But it's also a great rubber band shooter. Just click and it springs-off a rubber band. To be sure, it turns your writing instrument into a projectile launcher. And think about the stealth when you hit your target and then look as if you are busy writing an important report. You see, shooting rubber bands never went out of style. The pursuit simply went underground and stuck with the cool snipers. At least that is the story we have been telling ourselves.
The design of the Bandit pen is both simple and genius. Stretch a rubber band between two little nibs - one near the top and one on the part you click to get the pen to write.
Now your pen is armed and dangerous. Just point, click, and fire. And as a bonus, I reiterate it actually works as a pen. That way, no one will know you're packing heat. Spy-tacular!
It can be used with any type of rubber band. Penmanship, however is up to your skills. Ive requested the grandkids to gift me one for my birthday that happens to be round the corner. And to spoilsports who may object to my request will be subjected to a stinging sensation unless they agree to stop sniffin my contraband! [emailprotected]

MAS partners with ADEC Innovations
MAS Holdings (MAS), a leading manufacturer of intimate apparel, sports, swim and performance wear, has invested in CleanChain, a software solution from ADEC Innovations, in its quest to be a zero toxic manufacturer.
CleanChain, will be used by the group to manage its chemical usage throughout MAS global manufacturing operations and supply chain.
As part of its zero toxic commitments, MAS needed a process and reporting system that provides inventory registration and management, usage tracking and dashboard views for each of their facilities spread across the globe. After reviewing a number of different solutions, MAS selected CleanChainas it offered a number of unique features not offered by other software companies while allowing them to create solutions beyond the potential of their manual approach.
MAS,in collaboration with ADEC Innovations, has implemented CleanChain with an aim to fulfil their specific reporting needs. MAS has since facilitated the adoption of CleanChain at 20 chemical intensive manufacturing facilities including Australia, Bangladesh, China, Germany, Honduras, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Jordan, Mexico, Sri Lanka, United Kingdom, United States, and Vietnam.
We needed to more proactively and systematically manage the vast amounts of chemical information across our global operations,Sharika Senanayake, Director Environmental Sustainability, MAS Holdings, said. Since implementing CleanChain and collaborating with the ADEC Innovations team, we have transformed our inefficient and labour-intensive processes into a comprehensive system that helps us better understand and reduce risks, as well as reduce our manual burden and the associated costs of aggregating supply chain data, he added.
MAS attributes significant improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of chemical management across their supply chain to CleanChain. An early adopter of the platform, MAS joined in 2016 and has since played an important collaborative role in improving ADEC Innovations pioneering chemical information management solution.
ADEC Innovations is thrilled to partner with MAS Holdings in the deployment of CleanChain within their organization and across the supply chain, Robert A. Francisco, President, ADEC Innovations, noted. Elaborating further he said, Our collaboration supports MAS Holdings continued commitment to being a proactive and forward-thinking organization with products, plans and strategies that focus on sustainability.

Michael Tissera
At long last I got the opportunity through Leo Wijesighe to meet the much talked about Michael Tissera whom I met at his residence at Nawala. Although aged 78 he still looked the neat smart cricketer I used to epitomize as a budding cricketer.
As we started the ball rolling he mentioned to me that he has nothing to do with the administration of the present set up at the moment, and for very good reasons too, well more of that later. Michael mentioned to me that cricket came naturally to him and he was fond of reading cricket books, playing book cricket and collecting pictures of famous cricketers of the day. He was boarded at S. Thomas College and as was the case he got involved in many sports that were available at the school by the sea. He took a particular liking to tennis and was good at tweaking the tennis ball and bowled leg spin and googlies, which was spotted readily by one of the masters in charge of the first eleven team. As a result he was invited to bowl for the first eleven guys for two days and in next to no time he was summoned to play against St Benedicts in the first eleven team at the raw age of 14. Michael stated that although his school cricket career with the first eleven team spanned five years it was not a great one having only scored a hundred against Wesley College in 1958. He noted that he captained S Thomas in 1957 and 58 and his rival captains were Michael Welle and Lorenz Pereira respectively. He had another year left in him but he opted to leave school.
Michael had more success in club cricket by playing for the NCC. He recalled playing for the Daily Mirror Eleven in 1961, with some of the West Indian cricketers after their famous series in Australia where they tied a Test match in Brisbane, they were returning to England to play league cricket and it was a sort of a whistle stop engagement, he reminisced that he got a hundred in that match and according to reports published at the time it had been a magnificent knock.
As is the case I too had to ask some of the run of the mill questions! And here goes,
Michael was of the view that Sir Garry Sobers was simply fantastic and his first choice as the best he had seen, followed by Tom Graveney (long Tom), Norman ONeill, Ted Dexter, Doug Walters and Ian Chappell whom he mentioned as a magnificent captain.
Out of the present lot Tissera had high praise for Kusal Perera, Kusal Mendis and Dhananjaya de Silva and as regards Mathews, Michael was emphatic that a half fit player who ever he may be cannot contribute 100% to the team and would jeopardize the team plans. He also added that due to Mathews fitness issues its worse since the vital batting all rounder was missing.
He was 100% against politicians being office bearers in any sport.
Michael was of the view that the present team had a long way to go and stressed the point that it was not the talent which he said was there in abundance but harnessing that vital ingredient.
Michael was questioning the validity of having 14 to 15 clubs and according to him some of them are not having basic facilities and are like white elephants.
Michael pointed out the fact that in 2000-2001 a provincial tournament was started and all five teams had sponsors and Kumar Sangakkara and Muthiah Muralitharan commended the set up very well.
Michael was critical of the womens cricket team losing to lowly placed Thailand and he was at a loss why a player in the caliber of Chamari Attapattu was left out. (The author feels that Hemantha Devapriya resigning after that debacle was a good omen and the others should follow suit). Michael further added that during Nihal Kodithuwakkus tenure as the head coach of cricket the team fared much better and some girls of the present team still rings him up for advice.
Michael said that during the period between 2001 and 2018 there were 7 interim committees and Tissera questions why oh, why should they have interim committees when the elected bodies have done so well.
SHOWN THE DOOR
He also stated that when he was at the helm and put the house in order by sorting out discipline, planning and cricket matters in general after 6 or 7 months the higher ups then had shown him the door and have said thank you very much.
Although the enthusiasm and the fan fare that were inculcated to our fans after the World Cup triumph in 1996 has somewhat eroded all is not lost stated Michael. There is a lot of money in the game and he quoted IPL in India where they have done extremely well, the same could not be said of our equivalent.
Michael noted that we both have similar cultures but why we cannot succeed is due to mismanagement.
According to Michael the discipline, manners and the etiquette went down the drain in the last ten years and people of good quality are hard to find. In his days there was no match fixing, and bowlers did not bowl wides or no balls to get paid since there was no money involved.
The bookies in India started the rot.
Michael harped on the fact that the players to play well needed a stable mind. He further said, The last couple of years we have sacked two or three coaches, sacked Ford for no reason, brought Asanka from nowhere he was away for 20 years and the high performance manager left and Hathurusingha came, had seven captains in the last year.
Michael further added that if the captains are not sure whether they are coming or going obviously the players are not sure because they are walking on thin ice not sure of their place.
This malady has also gone to umpires and there is no continuity and when one set of businessmen takes charge and then another set takes up and the whole thing has gone topsy-turvy, Michael concluded with a furrowed brow.

Mistakes to avoid while applying make-up
Make-up can be your best friend or your worst enemy, depending on how you use it. Find the right blush for your skin tone, dont wear waterproof mascara daily and dont go overboard with your love for matching your everything with your outfit, suggest experts.
Make-up artiste Mouna Lall, and Jason Arland, senior manager at Artistry, have listed the dos and donts of make-up:
* The biggest mistake is not using a moisturising cream. One must wash and apply a cream or moisturiser depending on the skin type at least 15 minutes before pruning the skin.
* Always use a primer which helps the foundation to have a smooth surface to settle on. This makes make-up last long.
* If you have dry skin, any kind of moisturiser can be used where as if you have an oily skin then only water based foundations should be used.
* It is important to know how to apply foundation. We make big mistakes like using both our hands and rubbing it away instead of tapping and placing it on the skin with two fingers or a brush.
* Confusing correctors and concealers is a major confusion people often have. Correctors are for correcting ones skin tone whereas concealers will conceal the corrector and foundation, giving an even skin tone.
* Use a fine mineralised powder just to set the make-up base to avoid a heavy cakey face as the natural make-up look is in fashion.
* Matching same colour eyeshadow, lipstick and nail polish with clothes is a big no as the look becomes one-dimensional and is not appealing to the eyes. If you wear a pink outfit with gold work, then the eyes can be brown gold or smokey with only lipstick matching the dress.
* Heavy punched in the face kind of smokey eyes is a big turnoff. Blend it well.
* Go for a blush that is closest to your skin tone. Fair and medium skinned people can try the rosy pink and peaches. Nude, red and brown coloured blush look best on people with dusky and deeper skin tones.
* Using same colour lip liner all over the lips and following with lipstick is important for the lipstick to have a long stay and not leave a line after a while.
* Waterproof mascara is amazing, but not always. The water-resistant formula can dry out your lashes causing them to break easily. Also, removing the waterproof mascara takes a whole of effort which can again damage your lashes. Keep it reserved for weddings and parties.

Mohamed Salah given honorary citizenship of Chechnya
Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has been given honorary citizenship in Russias Chechnya republic by Ramzan Kadyrov, the strongman ruler who has been accused of human rights violations including the widespread torture of gay men.
Kadyrov handed Mr Salah a decree declaring him a citizen and pinned a medal on his chest at a dinner in honour of the Egypt team, who are training in Chechnya during the World Cup.
Mohamed Salah thanked us for our surprisingly warm and good hospitality, great affection for the team and excellent conditions for their stay and training, Kadyrov, who was banned last year from his beloved Instagram, wrote on Russian social network VK. Im sure our Akhmat club and the Egypt team will at some point hold a friendly match in Grozny.
Human rights defenders have condemned the approval of Chechnya as a World Cup training base due to its crackdowns on LGBT people and activists.
Alexander Agapov, president of the Russian LGBT Sport Federation, said he had questions for FIFA, the Egyptian football association, the Liverpool team and Mr Saleh about the dubious honour bestowed on him.
It is unacceptable for a footballer who should talk about equality and acceptance of all people in football to receive an award from a man who rejects any equality and acceptance of LGBTi people, who is accused of persecuting gay people and human rights defenders, Mr Agapov said. At least five died after Chechen authorities rounded up and tortured hundreds of gay men in a witch hunt last year. One victim said he was kept for 12 days in a cell doused in blood and repeatedly beaten with a club until he could no longer stand.  Daily Telegraph

Election Commission Report states
Multiple registrations struck off register
The names of 126,481 electors, which were revealed to be multiple registrations, had been deleted from Electoral Registers last year, states the Election Commission Performance Appraisal Report for the year 2017.
The report was tabled in Parliament last week. It stated that steps were taken to register them only under one eligible address.
Instances where two or more persons have been registered under the same National Identity Card number were also revealed at the inquiries conducted through correspondence with relevant electors, the report noted.
The highest number of multiple registrations amounting to 21,238 had been from Gampaha, while 19,832 multiple registrations had been found in Colombo. The number of multiple registrations in Kalutara had been 7,724, while it was 6,490 in Nuwara Eliya, 6,419 in Ratnapura and 6,302 in Kurunegala.
The Commission had also investigated and deleted from the Electoral Register the names of 31 persons, who were serving terms of imprisonment for various offences. The Commission in its report has noted with concern the gradual drop in the percentage when it comes to registration of new electors.
The total number of registered electors in 2016 and 2017 were 15,611,970 and 15,760,867, respectively. This is an increase of 148,897 electors when compared to 2016, but in 2015 the registered electors grew by 190,765. Therefore, even though there was a numerical increase in the number of electors, the percentage of increase has decreased considerably compared to 2015. It should be noted that all citizens including political parties and civil society activists should draw their attention in this regard, the report highlighted.
As per the report, the Commission has recognised six new political parties in 2017 after going through 94 applications.
The names of the newly recognized political parties are United National Freedom Front, United Left Front,Workers National Front, National Unity Alliance, National Front for Good Governance and Socialist Party of Sri Lanka.

Namibia humiliate Tunisia 118-0 in Rugby World Cup qualifier
JOHANNESBURG, Sunday: Namibia scored 18 tries to humiliate Tunisia 118-0 in a 2019 Rugby World Cup Africa qualifier this weekend while Kenya upset Morocco 28-24 in another second-round match.
Seeking a sixth consecutive appearance at the four-yearly rugby union global showcase, Namibia top the table with a maximum 10 points from two matches.
Kenya come next with five points from a bonus-point victory in Casablanca, followed by Morocco (three) and Zimbabwe (two) while Uganda and Tunisia are pointless.
The table toppers after the round-robin competition go to the World Cup in Japan while the runners-up get a second chance in an inter-continent repechage tournament. Lesley Klim, who plays for English second-tier club Doncaster, and Johan Corne Greyling scored four tries each for merciless Namibia, who led 52-0 at half-time. Chrysander Botha got three, Wian Conradie, Johan Deysel, Pieter-Jan van Lill, Damian Stevens, Johann Tromp and Max Katjijeko one each and they were awarded a penalty try.
Cliven Loubser kicked eight conversions, PW Steenkamp four and Botha one at a Windhoek stadium named after current Namibian state president Hage Geingob.

New Authority to develop villages in the plantations
The Government is to set up a new authority to develop new villages in the plantation region of Sri Lanka.
The Bill to set up an Authority known as the New Villages Development Authority for the Plantation Region has been issued yesterday, and it will soon be presented to Parliament by Hill Country, New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Minister P. Digambaran.
The new villages will replace the existing line room housing in estates with single houses and improved basic infrastructure facilities within those estates.
The Authority will be responsible for coordinating the planning and implementation of development projects in the plantation regions.
The Government, with this move, aims to include the plantation community into the social mainstream by socio-economic, cultural and infrastructure development in the plantation region. The new Authority will work hand in hand with other natiwonal, provincial, and district level implementing agencies in the plantation region.
The Authority will facilitate the issuance of title deeds for the legal occupants of the houses in the estates to grant them house ownership. It will assist the youth in the estate sector to enter the tertiary and higher educational institutions to pursue education. It will also promote alternative livelihood opportunities and provide necessary guidance and inputs in respect of them to the estate communities.
Strengthening conservation measures aimed at minimizing physical degradation of land and water resources and eliminating environmental pollution in estate lands, and identifying hazardous sites in consultation with the National Building Research Organization and National Disaster Management Centre are also functions coming under the proposed Authority.
The Board of Management of the proposed Authority will consist of 13 members including seven ex-officio members. The ex-officio members are from seven Ministries, namely the Plantation Industries, Finance, Public Enterprise Development, Provincial Councils and Local Government, Housing and Construction, Land and Hill Country, New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development. One of the appointed members will be from the Planters Association of Ceylon to represent the plantation companies.

Nutrition-Sensitive Agriculture; Focus more on end consumer - WB Country Director
South Asian governments are increasingly focusing on improving the nutrition conditions of their citizens and they are not only becoming signatories to international agreements and commitments. They are keen on reviewing ways in which they can reverse the trend at home- a positive way to address the issue, Dr. Idah Pswarayi-Riddihough Country Director for Sri Lanka and the Maldives World Bank said.
Speaking at a South Asian roundtable forum on Putting the Lens on the Consumer in Nutrition-Sensitive Agriculture and Food Systems in South Asia in Colombo yesterday Dr. Pswarayi-Riddihough said, the governments can further push this positive trend by focusing more on the end consumer and how they make choices on what to buy and eat. South Asias average stunting rate is estimated at 33 percent; while that for wasting is estimated at 12 percent.
In this backdrop, a group of South Asian stakeholders - including government and private sector officials  is currently holding a forum in Colombo to discuss how to create more effective nutrition-sensitive agriculture and food systems in South Asia. It was organized by the South Asia Food and Nutrition Security Initiative (SAFANSI) together with the World Bank.
The roundtable forum to be concluded today, will probe into what actions are needed to improve nutritional choices through consumer engagement with the private sector and governments. Engaging the public and private partners allows a partnership to form building on key factors such as taste, affordability and tradition, all key drivers to how and what we eat, she said.
Dr. Pswarayi-Riddihough pointed out that although there is much emphasis on nutrition-sensitive agriculture production and distribution of nutritious food, there is also a critical need to better understand the end consumer and how they make choices on what to buy and eat.
Also to work together with producers and consumers to improve nutrition is another need. Private food markets continue to be the primary platform through which consumers engage; as such there is a need to collaborate with the private and public sectors. It is also quite clear that enhanced food safety standards, naturally nutritious foods and food fortification require collaboration between the public and private sectors to get to scale.
It is important to continue to disseminate information on nutrition in ways and using target groups. A life-long chain of educating consumers is another requirement as each stage in life requires different nutrition.
She added, As the poorest are hardest hit by poor nutrition, a focus on improving their accessibility to good food should be ensured. Its no secret that fresh fruit and vegetables are often not the cheapest foods. In addition to improving agricultural chains to reduce their costs it is also possible to teach people how to grow some in their own back gardens.
A central theme to the South Asia Food and Nutrition Security Initiative (SAFANSI), the key organizer of this event is - strengthened commitment and increased capacity for more effective and integrated food and nutrition security actions. While the World Bank manages and administers the SAFANSI trust-fund, the funding is provided by the UK Government and the European Commission.
The approach SAFANSI has endorsed is to not focus on a single agency, sector, or official as responsible for food and nutrition security. Rather, it tries to engage all sectors, all of government and including regional bodies - focusing on sharing lessons and solutions that can be adapted by others.
The partners of the event include SUN, SNV, Food Industry Asia, Nutrition International, UNICEF, LANSA, HarvestPlus, Public Health Foundation of India, Tata Trusts, and Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems for Nutrition. The Government of Sri Lanka and the Presidential Secretariat were the hosts.

Ocean Pollution: is it on your boardroom agenda
We all know that human activities are threatening the health of the worlds oceans. More than 80 percent of marine pollution comes from land-based activities. From coral bleaching to sea level rise, entire marine ecosystems are rapidly changing.
Each square kilometer of ocean has 63,320 such particles floating at the surface, according to one recent study.
The 2016 United Nations Frontiers report estimates that East Asian seas are worst hit with levels some 27 times higher than average. Microplastics have been detected in environments as far-flung as Mongolian mountain lakes and the Arctic Circle. But what does that mean for human beings
From plastic bags to pesticides - most of the waste we produce on land eventually reaches the oceans, either through deliberate dumping or from run-off through drains and rivers. This includes:
Oil
Oil spills cause huge damage to the marine environment - but in fact are responsible for only around 12% of the oil entering the seas each year. According to a study by the US National Research Council, 36% comes down drains and rivers as waste and runoff from cities and industry.
Fertilizers
Fertilizer runoff from farms and lawns is a huge problem for coastal areas. The extra nutrients cause eutrophication - flourishing of algal blooms that deplete the waters dissolved oxygen and suffocate other marine life.
Eutrophication has created enormous dead zones in several parts of the world, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Baltic Sea.
Seas of garbage
Solid garbage also makes its way to the ocean. Plastic bags, balloons, glass bottles, shoes, packaging material  if not disposed of correctly, almost everything we throw away can reach the sea, starts destroying corals to creatures.
Decomposes very slowly, is often mistaken for food by marine animals. High concentrations of plastic material, particularly plastic bags, have been found blocking the breathing passages and stomachs of many marine species, including whales, dolphins, seals, puffins, and turtles. Plastic six-pack rings for drink bottles can also choke marine animals.
This garbage can also come back to shore, where it pollutes beaches and other coastal habitats.
Sewage disposal
In many parts of the world, sewage flows untreated, or under-treated, into the ocean. For example, 80% of urban sewage discharged into the Mediterranean Sea is untreated. Even in Sri Lanka the Sewage in major cities like Colombo are not treated in 95% of the areas of urban living and finds its way to the ocean. This sewage can cause human disease and lead to beach closures.
Almost every marine organism, from the tiniest plankton to whales and polar bears, is contaminated with man-made chemicals, such as pesticides and chemicals used in common consumer products. Some of these chemicals enter the sea through deliberate dumping.
For centuries, the oceans have been a convenient dumping ground for waste generated on land. This has continued as the accepted practice.
Damage
The Shippers Academy Colombo has taken an initiative to educate the people through the workforces, CEO Rohan Masakorala said that about 80% of the workforce is with the private sector and if corporates can start educating the employees and through that we can reduce the waste flowing to the ocean via the land, it is not an expensive mechanism as we believe education can eradicate the damage and manages ocean pollution, we as an organisation is specifically focusing on plastic as Sri Lanka has been identified as a major contributor to plastic ocean although being a small island.
We are having the first workshop on June 28, at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce with Marine Environment Pollution Authority (MEPA) to start this work as a long-term project, its our small way of contribution towards to SDG 14, and if the corporate board rooms take it seriously we have a winner Masakorala added.

An ode to death by greenery
Alnwick Castle in Northumberland, England, plays host to the small but deadly Poison Gardenfilled exclusively with around 100 toxic, intoxicating, and narcotic plants. Surrounded by the beautiful 12-acre Alnwick Garden, the boundaries of the Poison Garden are kept behind black iron gates, only open on guided tours. Visitors are strictly prohibited from smelling, touching, or tasting any plants, although some people still occasionally faint from inhaling toxic fumes while walking in the garden.
Though Alnwick Castle does feature many benign botanicals, the poisons growing behind its black iron gates are deadly. Jane Percy, who became the Duchess of Northumberland in 1995, was tasked by her husband to find something to do with the castles vast commercial space that had fallen into disuse.
Wanting to set her garden apart from others, she drew inspiration from the Medici poison garden in Italy and decided to make her own oasis of lethality.
The garden contains exotic plants like the Brugmansia of Brazil which can cause paralysis and death, along with common English plants like laurels whose smell can render people unconscious.
Despite warning visitors not to smell, touch, or taste her plants, people have regularly ignored these warning and have been found passed out in the garden.
The garden also contains a variety of illicit drugs, including cannabis, coca, and poppy. The facility uses these plants to further teach the science of apothecary plants and how they can be used.
Toxic plants in the garden
Strychnos nux-vomica: All parts are toxic, leading to convulsions and death via suffocation.
Hemlock: Muscular paralysis which stops people from being able to breathe (famously used to kill Socrates).
Castorbeans: Inhibits cells from producing proteins, causing pain, inflammation, hemorrhaging in the digestive systems, and vomiting blood.
Digitalis: Nausea, yellowed vision, blurry vision, seizures, and death.
Deadly Nightshade: Blurred vision, rashes, slurred speech, and hallucinations.

Paine promises beaten Australia will be WC force
Manchester, Sunday: Australia captain Tim Paine insisted the reigning champions would be "right in the thick of" next year's World Cup despite a 5-0 one-day international series loss to 2019 hosts England.
Paine's men were on course for a morale-boosting win when they reduced England to 114 for eight in the fifth ODI at Old Trafford on Sunday.
But they were ultimately made to pay for posting a total of just 205 themselves as Jos Buttler's unbeaten 110 saw England to a thrilling one-wicket win with nine balls to spare.
Australia, who still have a lone Twenty20 international at Edgbaston on Wednesday before their tour ends, arrived in England without six senior players.
Former captain Steve Smith and his deputy David Warner, two of the world's leading batsmen, were both given year-long bans for their roles in the ball-tampering scandal that marred a Test match against South Africa at Cape Town in March -- a fiasco that led to Paine being parachuted in as the new skipper.
They were also without injured Ashes-winning fast bowlers Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood, while all-rounder Mitchell Marsh was sidelined too.
Yet even when they have been at full-strength, Australia have struggled in ODI cricket lately, with Sunday's loss a 16th defeat in their last 18 completed matches in this format.
But for all England are now number one in the ODI world rankings, they have never won the World Cup, with the last of their three losing appearances in the final back in 1992.
Australia, by contrast, have won the World Cup five times and Paine believes they can draw on a reservoir of knockout knowledge come next year's edition.
"We have a number of players who are out, whether they are back or still injured, we're not sure," he said. "What I do know is...we have a number of players in this squad who have played in and won World Cups, so they know what it takes.
"I've heard a few times that this team doesn't have a plan, or it doesn't know where it's going, but we have a clear direction. "We know we are a long way off the mark at the moment but a World Cup is not for 12 months and we know when we get our best team on the park, playing our best cricket, we are going to be right in the thick of it."
But whether 33-year-old wicket-keeper Paine is involved remains open to question.
It appeared the combined cares of captaincy and keeping were weighing heavily when he dropped a simple catch during the fourth ODI in Durham, while he scored just 36 runs in five innings this series.
Alex Carey, Paine's heir apparent with the gloves, topped that in just one knock when the 26-year-old, playing as a specialist batsman, made 44 on Sunday.
"I've said a few times before when you are my age it's a bit foolish to look ahead," Paine also told reporters. "Certainly, I am really looking forward to captaining the Test team and continuing how I have been playing in that format. AFP

Postal employees asked to report to nearest PS office
The Post Master General yesterday requested employees of the Postal Department on strike to report to the nearest office of Postal Superintendent (PS) if they are unable to report to their designated office, Post Master General D.P.R. Abeyratne said in a press release yesterday.
He said the Deputy Post Master Generals and the Divisional Superintendents of Posts have been directed to provide all facilities to such employees of the department. The Department has arrived at this decision after taking into consideration a number of reports of harassment to postal employees who continue to report for duty from various parts of the country.
The statement said a public service has been disrupted with the ongoing strike, and the leave of all postal employees have been cancelled to provide continued service to the public.

## Title: The postal strike
## Supertitle:

The postal strike
The advice given by the Mahanayake of the Malwatte Chapter, the Most Venerable Tibbotuwawe Sri Sumangala Thera to the Postal Unions, currently on strike, hopefully, would make the strikers realize their folly and return to work. The counsel, coming from the Mahanayake, no less, should make the leaders of the Postal Trade Unions unbend from their rigid positions.
The Chief Prelate told the Convenor of the Postal Trade Union Front R.M. Chintaka Bandara, who called on him, on Sunday, that it was the public who are the ultimate victims of the spate of strikes currently sweeping the country. The Ven. Thera also observed that there should be a degree of flexibility, both, on the part of the government, and, the striking unions, if a solution is to be found. The Malwatte Prelate told the Trade Union leader that all strikes, whether postal or otherwise, finally inconvenienced the public, and a rigid stance by the parties concerned could only exacerbate the problem. Bandara alleged that the government was pursuing a policy of oppression instead of finding solutions to the problem of public servants.
By meeting with the Mahanayake, the Convenor of the PTUF obviously wanted their cause highlighted. Earlier it was the politicians and sportsmen who visited the Chief Prelates to seek their counsel.This is only the second occasion that a Trade Union leader had entered the sacred abode of the Mahanaykes to complain of an alleged injustice by the authorities. Earlier the President of the powerful GMOA, it was, who did the honours. However nothing seems to have come off that meeting with the chief custodians of the Dhamma. If anything, they seem to have hardened their stance when one would have thought that meeting the prelates gave enlightenment to the good doctors. Hopefully, the Postal Union leader would not lead his flock on the same path taken by the doctors.
The Postal Unions are demanding an overhaul of the present salary structure and for the introduction of a Service Constitution. These are matters that could well be sorted out through discussions. They certainly are not matters that warrant some 27,000 postal workers downing their tools. The strike, which has entered its second week, has brought with it chaotic scenes at the Central Mail Exchange with mountains of unattended mail and parcels that may also contain vital drugs and medicines sent to patients from friends and relatives abroad. Hence, like in the case of the doctors strikes, the current postal strike could also affect the ailing, with serious consequences. Hence, the need for both sides to thrash out matters behind closed doors.
Postal Services Minister M.A.M. Haleem, speaking in parliament, suspected a hidden political hand driving the strikers, while the Post Master General has threatened to suspend the payment of the June salaries of the striking postal workers. The Postal Unions in their turn have threatened to convert their present satyagraha campaign into a death fast if their demands are not met. Other public sector Trade Unions too are poised to express their solidarity with the striking postal workers, and, if this happens, a chaotic situation is bound to ensue that would be grist to the mill of the Joint Opposition.
The government, therefore, should work out a solution to the crisis and avert a full blown work stoppage in the public sector. Both sides should come down from their hard line positions and agree to meet half way in resolving the matter. Like the Most Venerable Mahanayake Thera observed, strikes have become all too common in this country today, which is not the ideal recipe for a nation trying to find its feet after a three decade long civil war. With major elections in the offing, there is bound to be similar work stoppages from time to time in the run up to the polls, with Trade Unions acting at the instance of power hungry politicians who have built a massive war chest during their years in power just for such occasions.
Hence, the government ought to be fully alert to such machinations and firm action taken where necessary. True, the Yahapalanaya government can take pride in restoring democracy and granting total freedom of speech, assembly and trade union rights. At the same time, it should also not ignore its obligations towards the public at large. Maintaining essential services is one of these key obligations. It should not shy away from harsh measures, when the occasion demanded. Saboteurs and mischief makers should be identified and dealt with firmly. Needless to say, there are obvious moves to create unrest in the country and drive away potential investors. Targeting the economy, the government's political opponents know, is a surefire way of making it unpopular.
Not just on the Trade Union Front. There are also disinformation campaigns currently on to poison the minds of the people, particularly the majority community, against the government. One such canard presently being spread is the alleged move by the government to downsize the army. A JO MP was seen the other day, giving a press conference to highlight this matter, when the Military spokesman had repeatedly denied the story. The government should device strong measures to counter such attempts.

Prelates call for spiritual mindset during Poson Poya
King Devanampiyatissa met Arahat Mahinda Thera at the foot of the Mihintale rock 2,326 years ago on a Poson Poya. Thereafter, a massive spiritual and cultural revolution took place making both the king and the subjects nonviolent and righteous. In this context, I feel that the President and the Prime Minister should inaugurate the Anuradhapura national Poson religious festival with the blessings of the Mahasanga and for the spiritual benefit of the devotees commemorating the Mihindu Buddhist vision, making it a tradition to be followed annually, the Chief Sangha Nayaka of the Nuwara Kalaviya and the Ruwanweli Chethiyamaradhipathi Ven. Pallegama Hemarathna Nayaka Thera told the Daily News, referring to the National Poson Festival this year.
The Nayaka Thera said further that the both government and private sector authorities should discourage the holding of carnivals, musical shows and unwarranted commercial advertising, underestimating Buddhism and its unique teachings, during the Poson Poya and the two days before and after the Poya.
It seems that some government agencies and private sector institutes organise commercially-friendly programmes, enterprises, and trade promotion campaigns targeting the devotees visiting the Anuradhapura and Mihinthale sacred zones for Poson religious observances. The Thera appealed to devotees to focus on the religious observances.
The Mihinthale Rajamaha Viharadhipathi Ven. Walawahengunuwewa Dhammarathna Nayaka Thera said that Buddhists commemorates the 2,326 Mihidhu Jayanthi or the 2,326th National Poson festival tomorrow.
The Thera said that it was a pity that some groups were used to celebrating this unique event adhering to non-religious techniques, provocative conduct, appearance and anti-social activities not befitting a genuine Buddhist.
He appealed to devotees, especially the youth, to avoid all unethical behavior and be exemplary Buddhists.
