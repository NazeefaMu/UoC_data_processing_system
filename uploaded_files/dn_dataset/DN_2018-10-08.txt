Anuradhapura farmers await water
Seventy three major tanks in Anuradhapura are drying up and major reservoirs in the area received only a little rainwater in the past few months, Irrigation Department Water Management and Training Director Wasantha Bandara Palugaswewa said.
He told that farmers were cautioned to use rainwater as much as possible to prepare land for cultivation and use tank water sparingly.
The farmers said it is a risk to cultivate now because they lost a few kannas in the drought. They are given packs of dry food worth Rs. 5,000 each, Somawansa said.
Water levels of 3,000 small tanks are very low and the issue will worsen in the 2018/2019 Maha season, he said.
We expected to cultivate 132,000 hectares in the 2018/19 Maha season. But we are compelled to cultivate only 1,21,170 hectares or even less if we do not receive rainfalls, he said.
About 36,384 mt of fertiliser subsidy will be distributed among 150,000 paddy farmers at a cost of Rs. 2,537 mm for the Maha season. A farmer then will have to spend only Rs. 500 on a 50 kg bag of fertliser, Anuradhapura District Agrarian Development Assistant Commissioner Asanka Somawansa said.

Hambantota Port may become forward military base for China  US VP
US Vice President Mike Pence in a speech at the Hudson Institute on Thursday said the Hambantota Port may soon become a forward military base for Chinas growing blue-water navy.
China uses so-called debt diplomacy to expand its influence. Today, that country is offering hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure loans to governments from Asia to Africa to Europe to even Latin America. Yet, the terms of those loans are opaque at best, and the benefits flow overwhelmingly to Beijing, Pence said.
Just ask Sri Lanka, which took on massive debt to let Chinese state companies build a port with questionable commercial value. Two years ago, that country could no longer afford its payments  so Beijing pressured Sri Lanka to deliver the new port directly into Chinese hands. It may soon become a forward military base for Chinas growing blue-water navy, he said.
Vice President Pence was delivering a speech on the topic The Administrations policy towards China at the Hudson Institute on Thursday.

Indian Ocean confab in Colombo on October 11-12
The Indian Ocean: Defining our Future conference which aims to create a platform for Indian Ocean littoral states and major maritime users to discuss issues of mutual interest and concern, will be held in Colombo on October 11-12.
This conference is held at a time when the Indian Ocean has emerged as one of the worlds busiest and most critical trade corridors, carrying two-thirds of global oil shipments and a third of bulk cargo and hosting the most critical Sea Lanes of Communication (SLOCs), directly impacting global trade and economy.
The conference will explore the regions strongest challenges and opportunities in a two-day symposium featuring international dignitaries and experts from the littoral states and beyond. Sri Lankas geographical location in the Indian Ocean and its long history of peaceful engagement with the international community makes it an ideal convenor of such an international conference.
The conference, scheduled to be held at Temple Trees, is an initiative of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe with the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The inaugural address of the conference will be delivered by President Sirisena while Prime Minister Wickremesinghe will deliver the keynote address. The UN Secretary-Generals Special Envoy for the Ocean, Ambassador Peter Thomson will also address the inaugural session.
The inaugural session titled Navigating Challenges and Prospects in the Indian Ocean: Towards a Shared Understanding will include key policymakers such as Indian Deputy National Security Advisor Pankaj Saran, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the US State Department Alice G. Wells, Director General of the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China Yi Xianliang, and Deputy Director General at Department of International Relations and Cooperation, South Africa, and Chair of the Committee of Senior Officials of IORA, Dr Anil Sooklal.
The speakers and participants will focus their discussions on four thematic areas, namely, The Indian Ocean Economy: The New Global Growth Pole; Life below Water: Reframing the Oceans as Development Spaces; An End to Uncertainty: Safety and Security at Sea; and Reinforcing International Law in the Indian Ocean: United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and Emerging Issues.
The conference is expected to lead to a multilateral diplomatic conference to be held early next year in Sri Lanka building on the work of this conference and moving towards an understanding among littoral states and major maritime users that would contribute towards greater peace, security and prosperity in the Indian Ocean.
It is envisioned that events of this nature would further augment the governments policy towards transforming Sri Lanka into a regional trading, logistics and financial hub.
The conference, which is a Track 1.5 exercise that includes policymakers and senior government officials along with academia, is organised by the Office of the Prime Minister, Foreign Affairs Ministry, and the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute in collaboration with the Global Maritime Crime Programme of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).

Main suspect dies in escape bid
The main suspect in the Weligampitiya shooting incident died after drowning in the Dadugama River in Ja-Ela during an escape attempt, at around 4 am on Saturday.
The suspect attempted to escape while he was being brought to the Peliyagoda Police Station from Nochchiyagama by police officers.
He was the main suspect in a shooting which occurred at the Weligampitiya Junction in Ragama, on September 30, where a woman was killed when gunmen opened fire at her car which was apparently mistaken for another.
The suspect, Ilandari Dewage Sanjeewa Sisira Kumara, alias Amunugoda Sanjeewa (44) was arrested by the Kelaniya Divisional Crimes Investigation Unit, in Nochchiyagama, Anuradhapura, on Friday (5) night.
According to the Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara, on their way to Colombo, the suspect had asked the accompanying police officers on several occasions if he could use the toilet as he had an upset stomach. The officers had stopped the vehicle several times for him to relieve himself. When he reached the Dadugama River, the suspect had informed the officers once again that he wanted the vehicle stopped to go to the toilet.
After getting out of the vehicle, the suspect had suddenly attacked the police officer on duty on his head and jumped into the Dadugama River, although handcuffed. The police officers had also jumped into the river and brought him back. However, he died on admission to the Ragama Hospital, Gunasekara said.
The suspect is an ex-Army Special Force soldier who resigned in 2004. He was identified as the main supporter of Ganemulle Sanjeewa alias Makilangamuwe Sanjeewa who is in remand custody in connection with several criminal cases and murders.
The deceased was earlier charged for possession of a hand grenade in Weliweriya, committing two murders in the Peliyagoda and Weliweriya areas, committing theft of over Rs. 7 crores in Peliyagoda and several other crimes, SP Gunasekara said. Revealing further information regarding the shooting incident which took place on September 30, the police media spokesman said that the shooting was targetted at Kalu Ajith alias Pathdanduwana Ajith on the order of Ganemulla Sanjeewa.
But, Anne Rasika Royel (40) who was driving a car with her nine-year-old daughter inside was shot dead by mistake. Pathdanduwana Ajith and another person, who are suspects in several ongoing court cases related to murder and attempted murder, were returning from the Peliyagoda Police Station when the incident happened. The duo has been ordered by court to report to the Peliyagoda Police Station and the Terrorism Investigation Division every Sunday in connection with their ongoing cases.
The car used by Amunugoda Sanjeewa and the other suspect Ibrahim Raheem in the September 30 shooting was found in the Athurugiriya area three days after the incident. They had hired the vehicle from a rent-a-car shop in Kandy. Ibrahim Raheem was arrested by the Special Crimes Investigation Division on October 3. Investigations into this crime are being conducted under the special supervision of the IGP, Gunasekara said.

Nomination of persons to CC to be finalised by Wednesday
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday said the nomination of persons to the Constitutional Council(CC) is likely to be finalised by Wednesday (10th).
The Speaker told the Daily News the remaining vacancies would be filled soon after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe returns to the country from a visit to the United Kingdom. He added that this is likely to happen on October 10 or soon afterwards.
The Speaker will send the names of the new CC members to the President for appointment as soon as he receives the final nominations.
The Speaker is yet to receive the list of nominations for the five members to be nominated by the Prime Minister and Opposition Leader and the nominee from the other political parties.
President Maithripala Sirisena nominated Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe as the Presidents representative to the CC last month.
The Speaker holds the Chairmanship of the Constitutional Council while the Prime Minister and Opposition Leader are ex-officio members.
Another five members are appointed by the President, on the nomination submitted by both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition.
From these five members, three should be civil society representatives. One other person is appointed by the Members of Parliament from a political party other than the parties to which the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition belong.
When, inquired about possible nominees to the CC the Speaker said he was not in a position to discuss any names but added he would send the nominations to the President as soon as they are finalised.
However, the Daily News learns that the three civil society representatives are likely to be Senior Lecturer in Law at University of Colombo Attorney-at-Law N.Selvakumaran (Dean of Faculty at Law 2000  2012), Educator and Diplomat Javed Yusuf and Diplomat Jayantha Dhanapala who was Sri Lankas official candidate for the post of UN Secretary-General, before withdrawing from the race on September 29,2006.
However, there is opposition to the nomination of Dhanapala from some sections, the Daily News learns.
Although CPA Executive Director Dr.Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu was to be nominated as a civil society representative, the Joint Opposition is opposing the move, it is learnt.
Meanwhile, Justice and Prison Reforms Minister Thalatha Athukorale and former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa are likely to be nominated to the CC by the Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader.
The 10-member CC is the apex decision making body that recommends the appointments to the Independent Commissions and high ranking positions such as the Attorney General, Auditor General, Parliament Secretary General, IGP, Chief Justice and Supreme Court Judges etc.
It remains defunct since last month following the expiration of the three-year term of six members.
Meanwhile, current Chief Justice Priyasath Dep completes his term on Friday (12). Constitutionally, the President must forward the name of his nominee for Chief Justice to the Constitutional Council which must then approve the nomination.
If the appointment of the Chief Justice is delayed the President can appoint an acting Chief Justice for a period of 14 days. If the appointment of the CJ gets delayed due to the lack of a quorum in the CC, the most likely person to be appointed as Acting Chief Justice will be Senior Supreme Court Judge, Eva Wanasundera, government sources said.

Dissanayake said the Airline had to incur heavy expenditure on fuel during the relevant period.
Although SriLankan Airlines Chief Executive Officer Kapila Chandrasena and members of the higher management knew in advance about the possibility of escalating fuel prices, their main attention was on the Via Capital Business Plan. The Airline had to bear excessive expenditure on fuel due to the nonchalance and disinterest shown by the higher management.
He said Bank loans too were used to pay for fuel.
