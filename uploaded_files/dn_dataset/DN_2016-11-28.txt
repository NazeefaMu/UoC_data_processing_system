Sri Lanka beat Zimbabwe to one-day trophy
Bulawayo: Sri Lanka capped a productive month of cricket in Zimbabwe by lifting the triangular series trophy on Sunday, beating the hosts by six wickets in the final.
Having comfortably beaten Zimbabwe in both Tests in Harare at the start of November, Sri Lanka added another trophy to their haul as half-centuries from captain Upul Tharanga and Kusal Mendis saw them chase a target of 161 with more than 12 overs to spare.
Although regular skipper Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal missed the entire tour due to injury, Sri Lanka rarely felt their absence as they lost just one game in the process of clinching the tri-series, which also involved the West Indies.
Full credit to the guys, everyone has done a really great job over the series, said Tharanga.
We have found some new players as well who have put their hands up and performed well.
Zimbabwe pulled off a stunning comeback to beat the West Indies in their last round robin game and reach the final, but could not repeat the feat when their batsmen failed again on Sunday.
A reshuffle saw openers Brian Chari and Chamu Chibhabha both left out, with Peter Moor promoted to the top of the innings and Tarisai Musakanda given an international debut.
But on a drizzly morning, they still lost their openers inside the first five overs to slip to 19 for two.
Musakanda and Craig Ervine were able to revive the innings with a 53-run stand for the third wicket, only for Jeffrey Vandersay to end the resistance as he Ervine caught and bowled for 25, then had the debutant caught at slip for 36.
With Sachith Pathirana dismissing Sikandar Raza Butt and Malcolm Waller in the space of three overs, and Vandersay taking care of captain Graeme Cremer to record figures of 3 for 50, Zimbabwe slid to 133 for seven.
Zimbabwe had recovered from 89 for seven to post 218 for eight against the West Indies, but there was no such fightback on Sunday as Asela Gunaratne grabbed the final three wickets in the space of just four deliveries to end the innings inside 37 overs.
With a seemingly simple target in front of them, Sri Lankas top order were too hasty to knock it off and let Zimbabwe back into the match as a result.
Recalled to the Zimbabwe side for the first time since he was forced to remodel his action, left-arm seamer Brian Vitori dismissed Sri Lanka's top three to reduce them to 44 for three at the lunch interval.
But after the break, Tharanga and Mendis returned with a calmer mindset, and quietly batted Sri lanka into a position of dominance as they added 75 for the fourth wicket. We knew we only had to get one good partnership going, said Tharanga. Mendis batted very well, and from there it got easier and easier.
Mendis fell for 57 with Sri Lanka requiring another 44 runs for victory, but captain Tharanga saw his side across the line to finish unbeaten on 57 and leave Zimbabwe wondering what could have been.
To get to a final is always nice, but we were a bit disappointing today, said Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer. We didnt think our day would end like this.
Kusal Mendis won the Man of the Match award for his fine knock of 57 in the tri-series finalagainst Zimbabwe at Bulawayo on Sunday. Mendis also won the Man of the Series award. AFP

Ashwin fifty gives India edge after England fightback
MOHALI, Sunday : Ravichandran Ashwin hit an attacking half-century to give India the edge after England's bowlers dented the hosts with quick wickets on day two of the third Test in Mohali on Sunday.
India were 271 for six at stumps with Ashwin (57) and Ravindra Jadeja (31) at the crease. The hosts trail by 12 runs in response to England's first innings score of 283.
England leg-spinner Adil Rashid claimed three wickets while seam bowler Ben Stokes chipped in with two wickets to hurt India.
Ashwin and Jadeja revived the innings with an unbeaten 67-run stand for the seventh wicket after India lost four of their batsmen in the final session. Ashwin struck his second successive fifty as he smashed eight boundaries during his 82-ball stay at the crease so far.
He combined with the left-handed Jadeja to take the attack to the opposition in the final hour of play as the duo scored at over four runs an over.
India were cruising nicely at 148-2 until tea, after which a resurgent England wreaked havoc to claim three wickets in the space of 19 deliveries and eight runs.
India, who rode on half-centuries from skipper Virat Kohli, Cheteshwar Pujara and Ashwin, were reduced to 156-5 before bouncing back.
Rashid struck on the second delivery after tea to end Pujara's dogged resistance as Chris Woakes completed a great running catch from deep mid-wicket.
Pujara (51), who recorded his 11th Test half-century, put on 75 runs for the third wicket with Kohli (62) and showed tremendous grit during his 104-ball stay.
Rashid then got a struggling Ajinkya Rahane for nought in his very second over of the session after trapping the batsman lbw.
But it was Jos Buttler who drew the biggest cheers from the visiting crowd after his sharp fielding from point got debutant Karun Nair (4) run out with a direct throw. However Kohli stayed composed to record his 14th Test fifty as he soldiered on with Ashwin to try and rebuild the innings. Stokes claimed the prized wicket of Kohli after the star batsman was caught behind.
Stokes, who was reprimanded on Saturday for using offensive language after getting out and exchanging words with Kohli, put his hand over his mouth as the skipper walked back.
Kohli had put up stubborn resistance against a disciplined English pace attack that put up a strong show on a pitch expected to turn as the match progresses.
Earlier, returning wicketkeeper-batsman Parthiv Patel (42) gave the hosts a sturdy start before being trapped lbw off Rashid in the fourth over after lunch.
India lead the five-match series 1-0.
