Africa, Asia vulnerable to spread of Zika Virus :WHO
SWITZERLAND: The Zika virus linked to a microcephaly outbreak in Latin America could spread to Africa and Asia, with the world's highest birth rates, the World Health Organization warned as it launched a global response unit against the new emergency.
The WHO on Monday declared an international public health emergency due to Zika's link to thousands of recent birth defects in Brazil.
"We've now set up a global response unit which brings together all people across WHO, in headquarters, in the regions, to deal with a formal response using all the lessons we've learned from the Ebola crisis," said Anthony Costello, WHO director for maternal, child and adolescent health.
"The reason it's a global concern is that we are worried that this could also spread back to other areas of the world where the population may not be immune," he told a news conference in Geneva on Tuesday.
"And we know that the mosquitos that carry Zika virus - if that association is confirmed - are present ... through Africa, parts of southern Europe and many parts of Asia, particularly South Asia..."
Costello added the WHO was drafting "good guidelines" for pregnant women and mustering experts to work on a definition of microcephaly including a standardised measurement of baby heads.
"We believe the association is guilty until proven innocent," he said, referring to the connection drawn in Brazil between the Zika virus and microcephaly, a condition where babies are born with abnormally small heads.
"Mass community engagement" in areas with the mosquitos and their breeding grounds, and rapid development of diagnostic tools are essential to curbing the virus, as a vaccine may be years away, said Costello, a paediatrician.
Sanofi has launched a project to develop a vaccine against Zika, the most decisive commitment yet by a major vaccine producer to fight the disease.

Airstrikes destroy ISIS radio station in Afghanistan
AFGHANISTAN: US airstrikes have destroyed an ISIS-operated radio station in a remote part of eastern Afghanistan, officials said on Tuesday.
"Voice of the Caliphate" radio was destroyed by two US airstrikes, according to a US military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief media on the subject.
Army Col. Mike Lawhorn, spokesman for the US-NATO mission in Afghanistan, said US forces conducted two "counter-terrorism airstrikes" late on Monday in Achin district, in the eastern Nangarhar province, without elaborating.
An ISIS affiliate has emerged in Afghanistan over the past year, with a military presence in districts near the border with Pakistan. The radio station was broadcasting illegally across Nangarhar, calling on fighters to join the group and threatening journalists in the provincial capital, Jalalabad.
Afghan officials had said they believed the broadcasts were coming from mobile facilities that could be moved easily back and forth across the mountainous border.
The spokesman for the Nangarhar governor, Attaullah Khogyani, said the strikes had also killed 21 ISIS supporters, including five who were working for the radio station.
The station was set up in late 2015, following months of fierce fighting between ISIS group militants and the Taliban, who also maintain a significant presence in the region. Although ISIS and the Taliban both want to impose a harsh version of Islamic rule, they are bitterly divided over leadership and strategy, with the Taliban narrowly focused on Afghanistan and ISIS bent on establishing a worldwide caliphate. Radio is a powerful medium in Afghanistan, where most people do not have televisions and only 10 per cent of the population has access to the Internet. Nearly everyone has access to radio, with around 175 stations operating across the country.
The US State Department recently added the ISIS Afghan affiliate to its list of foreign terrorist organizations.

'FCID: Foremost enemy of those who ruined country'
The FCID has become the foremost enemy of those who skimmed the wealth of the nation, said JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
Addressing a press conference yesterday at the JVP office in Battaramulla, he said all the thieves who robbed public money are now standing against the FCID.
"Some deputy ministers within the government itself are stating that the FCID is not legal, a matter that must be settled within the Government. The FCID is operating under the IGP. We believe such a special unit must exist to take action against those involved in large scale frauds. It is the FCID which investigated on persons such as Basil Rajapaksa, Johnston Fernando and Yoshitha Rajapaksa. That was the reason why they are so scared of it," he said.
He further said the arrest of Yoshitha Rajapaksa was based on two major questions. "One was how a capital of Rs. 234 million was found to commence the CSN. What we tell former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is to say how this money was found and get his son released. If that money is not from the salary of Yoshitha or Mahinda and the income from the Medamulana Walauwa, then it should definitely be Treasury funds. In other words public funds. Should not those who robbed the public money be punished Under the Money Laundering Act, such money could be taken over. There is enough evidence to proceed on this matter," he added.
He said the arrest of Yoshitha was not an act of political revenge, adding that it was a result of legal action taken jointly by the Police and the Court.
He said the JVP will give its fullest support for the investigations taking place on bribery and corruption, adding that they would never give up the fight until the thieves are brought to book.
"Investigations concerning nearly 35 cases of corruption and bribery have been completed and sent to the Attorney General. However, the Attorney General is yet to reply to over 30 of them. Therefore legal action have been delayed," he said.
Referring to comments made by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake to his allegations in Parliament on the import of undervalued Prado jeeps, Dissanayake challenged Karunanayake for an open debate on TV.

Formation of new political party is likely - Dilum
There is an increased possibility of the formation of a new political party or front resulting from the crisis situation in the SLFP, said Kandy District UPFA Parliamentarian Dilum Amunugama.
He said there is a clarion call by SLFP grass roots supporters for the formation a separate party saying that they would never vote for the SLFP again even if its campaign was led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. He said Rajapaksa should provide the leadership to the new political party or front formed at the request of the people.

'Gammanpila, MR's nemesis'
The same fate that befell the proverbial goat who got his head stuck inside a pot will befall former President Mahinda Rajapaksa due to the antics of the group led by Udaya Gammanpila, said Rural Economy Minister P.Harrison.
The Minister said so addressing a meeting held at the Animal Production and Health Department office at Gannoruwa on February 2.
He said the Wimal , Gammanpila duo who had won elections by getting onto the SLFP bandwagon were trying to hang on to Mahinda Rajapaksa continuously because they had no future.
Instead of visiting the Abhayarama temple and indulging in politics it would be better for the former President bow out of politics gracefully and enjoy life in retirement.
Minister Harrison said the country spent nearly Rs 40,000 million on milkfood imports annually which amounted to a daily expenditure of about Rs 10 million. As such steps should be taken to further improve local milk production to ease this heavy burden on the country's exchequer.
He said a programme had also been launched on the initiative of the President to make the country self sufficient in green gram, kurakkan, meneri and ground nuts.
Ministry Secretary Renuka Ekanayake and Hewaheta UNP organiser Shanthini Kongahage were also present on the occasion.

Julian Assange 'will surrender' if UN rules against him


Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has said he will turn himself over to UK police on Friday if a UN panel rules he has not been unlawfully detained.

He took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in west London in June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over a sexual assault claim he denies.

In 2014 he complained to the UN that he was being "arbitrarily detained".On Twitter Mr Assange said he would accept a decision against him but hoped to walk free if it went in his favour. The UN's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is due to announce the findings of its investigation into Mr Assange's case on Friday. The panel of legal experts took evidence from the UK and Sweden. It has made previous rulings on whether imprisonment or detention is lawful although it does not have any formal influence over the British and Swedish authorities.

Return of passport

Australian Mr Assange was originally arrested in London in 2010 under a European Arrest Warrant issued by Sweden. He was granted asylum by Ecuador and entered the country's embassy in Knightsbridge after the UK Supreme Court ruled the extradition against him could go ahead.

His Wikileaks organisation posted secret American government documents on the internet and Mr Assange says he believes Washington will seek his transfer to the US if he is sent to Sweden.

In the statement published by Wikileaks on Twitter, Mr Assange said: "Should the UN announce tomorrow that I have lost my case against the United Kingdom and Sweden I shall exit the embassy at noon on Friday to accept arrest by British police as there is no meaningful prospect of further appeal.

"However, should I prevail and the state parties be found to have acted unlawfully, I expect the immediate return of my passport and the termination of further attempts to arrest me."

Last October, Scotland Yard said it would no longer station officers outside the Ecuador embassy following an operation which had cost it 12.6m. But it said "a number of overt and covert tactics to arrest him" would be deployed to arrest Mr Assange.

Two months earlier, Swedish officials said they were optimistic about reaching an agreement with Ecuador which could pave the way for the questioning of Mr Assange in London. (Source : BBC)

'Nobody should interfere with legal proceedings'
The minor political parties which are trying to divide the SLFP to achieve their selfish motives are bound to face the same fate that befell Nasruddin's donkey, Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa said.
He made this observation addressing the media yesterday at the Government Information Department.
Minister Zoysa further said that as an Advisor of the party Mahinda Rajapaksa has to play a vital role of protecting the SLFP. Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike and as the Present Chairman of the party President Maithripala Sirisena too have a responsibility to safeguard the party without letting it to be divided.
"By accepting the party leadership, President Maithripala Sirisena has made a great contribution towards the betterment of the party. The SLFPers who are currently holding ministerial portfolios in the government haven't joined the UNP." he said.
He also added that the government of consensus was formed only for two years to face both local and international challenges successfully. "But, we compete at the elections separately".
Responding to a question raised by a journalist about Yoshitha Rajapaksa who is currently remanded in Welikada Prison, Minister Zoysa said that Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family should be protected by the government as former president of the country. "But nobody can intervene with the legal proceedings against him or his family members".
"The team of Pythagoras such as Vasu, Dew and Dinesh were among the first to raise their hands in support of the 100 Day programme of the government. Now they criticizing us," he said.
Minister Zoysa further added that the SLFP lost 30 percent of its minority vote at the recent elections because of a brother of former Presdient Mahinda Rajapaksa.

A third of migrants sailing to Greece are children: UNICEF
SWITZERLAND: Children now make up over a third of the migrants making the perilous sea crossing from Turkey to Greece, the UN said, as two more babies drowned off Europe's shores.
For the first time since the start of the migrant crisis in Europe, there are also now more women and children crossing the border from Greece to Macedonia than adult males, according to UN children's agency UNICEF.
The figures emerged as Europe struggles with its biggest movement of people crisis since World War II, with more than a million people fleeing war, violence and poverty risking life and limb to reach its shores last year.
"Children currently account for 36 percent of those risking the treacherous sea crossing between Greece and Turkey," the UNICEF spokeswoman Sarah Crowe said.
"Children and women on the move now make up nearly 60 percent" of those entering from Macedonia, she added.
The figures mark a significant shift since June, when 73 percent of migrants were adult males and only one in 10 were under the age of 18. Marie Pierre Poirier, UNICEF's special coordinator for the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe, said women and children were even more vulnerable to the dangers of trying to travel to Europe.
"The implication of this surge in the proportion of children and women on the move are enormous," she said in a statement.
"It means more are at risk at sea, especially now in the winter, and more need protection on land."
Underlining her point, the International Organization for Migration said Tuesday that one in every five who drowned last month while trying to sail from Turkey to Greece was a child, with minors accounting for 60 of the 272 deaths.
Including during January, a total of 330 children have died in those waters over the past five months, many of them just metres from shore, the organisation said.
The drownings continue a grim trend that accelerated last year when nearly 4,000 people died trying to reach Europe by sea.
The plight of children was brought home last year when the body of Syrian toddler Aylan Kurdi was found washed up on the shore of the Greek island of Lesbos, horrifying the international community.
The bodies of two more babies were recovered by the Turkish coastguard in the Izmir province on Tuesday along with seven dead adults, just days after another 37 people drowned off another part of the coast.
Children were among the dead, an AFP photographer said, although the exact number was unclear.
The EU on Tuesday urged Greece to check the flow of asylum seekers to its shores, including better registration and security checks, or risk having border controls imposed with other members of the passport-free Schengen zone.
Greece responded by saying the army will do more to help police and port authorities deal with the new arrivals.
In January, almost 62,200 migrants and refugees entered Europe through Greece, most of them from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, the IOM said, close to a third of them unaccompanied minors. The Europol police agency warned Sunday that youngsters arriving alone were particularly vulnerable to exploitation, abuse and trafficking.
More than 10,000 unaccompanied children registered after arriving in Europe over the past 18 months to two years had disappeared, the EU's law enforcement agency said.

US fortifying Europe's East to deter Putin
US: President Barack Obama plans to substantially increase the deployment of heavy weapons, armored vehicles and other equipment to NATO countries in Central and Eastern Europe, a move that administration officials said was aimed at deterring Russian from further aggression in the region.
The White House plans on paying for the additional weapons and equipment with a budget request of more than $3.4 billion for military spending in Europe in 2017, several officials said Monday, more than quadrupling the current budget of $789 million. The weapons and equipment will be used by U.S. and NATO forces, ensuring that the alliance can maintain a full armored combat brigade in the region at all times.
Though Russia's military activity has quieted in eastern Ukraine in recent months, Moscow continues to maintain a presence there, working with pro-Russian local forces. Administration officials said the additional NATO forces were calculated to send a signal to President Vladimir V. Putin that the West remained deeply suspicious of his motives in the region.
"This is not a response to something that happened last Tuesday," a senior administration official said. "This is a longer-term response to a changed security environment in Europe. This reflects a new situation, where Russia has become a more difficult actor."
It is not clear how Russia will react to the fortified military presence along NATO's eastern border. Since the signing of a cease-fire agreement last year, Putin's government has tried to ease tensions with the West. Officials said the Russian government was eager for the U.S. and Europe to roll back economic sanctions, which suggested that it would not escalate tensions over the new military commitments.
But outside analysts were surprised by the magnitude of the increase in military funding for Europe, which is part of an overall budget request of $580 billion for the Pentagon. Obama, according to a defense official, is also going to ask Congress for a 35 percent increase - $7 billion - to fight Islamic State militants.
Some analysts said the increased funding and deployments would certainly rattle Russia. Among the countries where the equipment and additional forces could be deployed are Hungary, Romania and the Baltic countries, Pentagon officials said.
"This is a really big deal, and the Russians are going to have a cow," said Evelyn N. Farkas, who until October was the Pentagon's top policy official on Russia and Ukraine. "It's a huge sign of commitment to deterring Russia, and to strengthening our alliance and our partnership with countries like Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia."
While the increase in funding for Europe is significant, the administration is proposing that the money come out of a separate war-funding account that is meant to pay for operations in the conflicts in Iraq and Syria, as well as the continued U.S. military presence in Afghanistan. That means it is a one-time request, not necessarily a continuing commitment, built in to budget requests beyond 2017, officials said.
"It's a way to get around the budget caps" imposed on the Pentagon, said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
But, Harrison added, the budget workaround may not succeed in reassuring fretful Eastern European allies because it leaves the decision on what do about future military spending in Europe for the next administration.
"If you want to be reassuring to our allies in Europe," he said, "you've got to show you've got a future plan."
Administration officials said the new investments were not just about deterring Russia. The weapons and equipment could also be deployed along NATO's southern flank, where they could help in the fight against the Islamic State or in dealing with the influx of migrants from Syria.
"Initially, we were focusing on reassurance," said one of the senior officials, who, like the others, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal military planning. "But while that was happening, we were stepping back and asking how to address the changed environment in a more programmatic and consistent way."

Will march forward to establish good governance - PM
The United National Front (UNF) will march forward with the coalition of all parties that intend to establish good governance, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister made this observation yesterday, following an MoU signed between the Democratic Party (DP) led by Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and the UNF at Temple Trees.
He said all Tamil political parties too have pledged their support to form a National government.
LTTE leader Prabhakaran had demanded the people not to raise the National Flag. Those who pose themselves as patriots have also requested the people not to hoist the National Flag to celebrate independence. The Prime Minister said that those who identify themselves as patriots, have refused to hoist the National flag, when all communities have joined to take the country forward. The future political journey of the Democratic Party will be in coalition with the United National Front, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said. Stating that he started his political journey with the United National Party, Field Marshal Fonseka added that his future journey in the political arena would not be hard when working with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Fonseka said that he contested the 2010 Presidential Elections as the common candidate to fight against a corrupt rule, adding that he would continue to raise his voice against corruption.
UNP General Secretary and Public Enterprises Development Minister Kabir Hashim and Ministers Lakshman Kiriella, Malik Samarawickrama, Rajitha Senaratne, Ravi Karunanayake and Deputy Minister Ruwan Wijewardene were present.
