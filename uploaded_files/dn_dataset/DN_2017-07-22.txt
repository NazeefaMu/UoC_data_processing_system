Need to reverse damage caused
Minister Daya Gamage, ICAPP Asia-Europe Bureau Vice Chairman:
Primary Industries Minister and United National Party Senior Deputy Chairman Daya Gamage was appointed ICAPP Asia-Europe Bureau Vice Chairman at the International Conference of Asian Political Parties (ICAPP), recently.
The International Conference of Asian Political Parties (ICAPP) was launched in Manila in September 2000 to promote exchanges and cooperation between political parties with various ideologies from different Asian countries.
This is to enhance mutual understanding and trust among Asian countries, and to promote Asias regional cooperation through the unique role and channel of political parties. The primary focus of the Regional Leaders was on climate change in the region and how to overcome challenges.
Minister Gamage speaking at the conference said, A systematic change of behavior is needed. This means immediate investment and worldwide use of renewable energy sources such as solar, hydroelectric and wind power. At the same time, we have to reverse the damage through recycling every gram of plastic and metal used.
I must stress that although developed countries may have been the initial contributors to global warming and climate change, as Asia develops, we must not make the same mistakes they did. Instead, we must develop to be more energy-efficient and reduce our impact - especially as Asia is home to almost 2/3 of the world's population. It is critical that we get our house in order before looking over to see what our neighbors are doing, the minister added.
He said Asia is home to more than half of the worlds population and to most of the worlds production which makes it one of the most dynamic regions in the world, with huge economic potential.
Therefore, national co-existence and collaboration among economic structures, and institutions of Asia and Europe are of utmost importance for moving towards the future.
Both regions should nurture this relationship towards greater integration, he said.

AG says amendments to Inland Revenue Bill at committee stage
The Attorney General yesterday informed Supreme Court that several amendments are to be brought to the proposed Inland Revenue Bill at the committee stage in Parliament.
Additional Solicitor General Farzana Jameel with Deputy Solicitor General Arjuna Obeysekere appearing on behalf of the Attorney General made these remarks in response to ten Special Determination petitions challenging the Inland Revenue Bill taken up before Supreme Court yesterday.
The Attorney General insisted that Section 67(1), (2), (6) and (7) of the Bill to be deleted and will introduce new sections during the committee stage in Parliament. The sixth Schedule of the Bill relating to Insurance Business is to be amended.
ASG Jameel stated that the present bill was a complete departure from the existing law. It is to provide for several omissions in the present law.
The bill is to provide for simplicity, transparency, easy administration and prevent unnecessary clogging of tax appeals. It will introduce a new system of administrative review.
Under Article 148 of the Constitution, Parliament has full control of public finance.That means Parliament can decide on the sources, allocation and means to keep checking on public finance. The present Bill gets its legitimacy from the 2017 budget proposals. The proposed law is not arbitrary.
Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana appearing on behalf of the petitioners informed Court that residents and non-residents are taxed at the rates given in the first Schedule. Accordingly the highest ratios are as follows; When annual taxable income is between 1.8 M to 2.4 M, 16%; 2.4 M-3 M, 20% and Exceeding 3 M, 24%.
Therefore an individual could be liable to a maximum of 24% of his annual income, Vitharana added.
On the contrary Companies engaged solely in the following businesses are taxed at the rate of (only) 14%; i.e:-
(a) Conducting agricultural business, (b) Providing educational services,(c) Engaged in promotion of tourism,(d) Providing information technology and (e) Business of exporting goods and services.
Therefore, the tax liability of the individuals engaging in the above trades, businesses (eg; farmers, tourist guides, teachers, IT technicians etc) may go up to 24%. However the liability of the companies engaging in the same trades, professions, businesses will remain at 14%., Mr. Vitharana said.
The petitioners counsel further stated that through this process, thousands of people daily engaged in the above trades, etc., will be placed in unfair competition with companies with less tax liability. This is amounting to unequal treatment and violation of Article 12(1) and violation of freedom to engage in employment, trade, vocation et (Article 14(1)(g), Article 3 of the Constitution.
Ten petitioners including MP Bandula Gunawardane and Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) Secretary Amal Randeniya are seeking a declaration that bill shall become law only through a two-third majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum.
The petitioners stated that a bill titled Inland Revenue, a Bill to provide for the imposition of income tax for any year of assessment commencing on or after April 1, 2017 was presented to the Parliament and placed on Order Paper of the Parliament on July 5, 2017.
Further hearing fixed for July 24.
Presidents Counsel Nijel Hatch with Romesh De Silva PC, Sanjeewa Jayawardane PC, Manohara De Silva PC and Senior Counsel Kanishka Witharana appeared for the petitioners.
Additional Solicitor General Farzana Jameel with Deputy Solicitor General Arjuna Obeysekere and Senior State Counsel Gnanaraj appeared for the Attorney General.

The tournament will be worked off from July 24 to 28 at RCGC. This was revealed to the medis during press briefing at the RCGC recently.
Addressing the gathering RCGC president Lal Dias said, the RCGC Open Golf tournament which is played as an Open Golf Championship where all golfers in the country can participate was inaugurated in 1970 and was open to all golfers, both professionals as well as amateurs. It was a true test of golf with 4 rounds of stroke play to determine the champion golfer of the year.
The RCGCs resident professional H.L Premadasa won the championship the first three years, after which Sri Lankas best golfer ever, Nandasena Perera won it a record 7 times. Club amateurs Pheroze Billimoria and Rusi Captain won it twice and once respectively. Other winners included Jessie Perera, while in 1995 which was the last time it was played, Tissa Chandradasa took home the trophy.
Club captain, Ranil Pathirana went on to say that due to unavoidable circumstances the RCGC Open was discontinued and this year, has been resurrected by the Clubs GM, Nalin Jayatilleke, with Altair having come forward as principal sponsor of this prestigious tournament.
There will be over 100 of the best mens golfers in the country vying for the top spots. There will be a cut off after the first two days, after which the best 30 golfers will advance to the final two days. We have over 60 entries and this has attracted most of the professional golfers in Sri Lanka and is the only open tournament that is played other than the Sri Lanka Open. Top favourites of this years tournament are Sri Lankas veteran golfer and Asian Games silver medalist Nandasena Pereras son Mithun Perera as well as Anura Rohana, Prabagharan, and N. Thangaraja, said Nalin Jaytilleke, GM, RCGC.
Director Indocean Developers, Pradeep Moraes and Jay Dias, Head of Sales and Marketing, Altair were also present at the media briefing.
Moraes said that Altair was particularly pleased to support this tournament as in keeping with its
title open to all strata of competitors based solely on competency and membership or club affiliation was not a restrictive factor. Providing the opportunity for a broad field of Sri Lankan
talent to showcase their skills after a period of 22 years is certainly a pleasing prospect. As Altair always stands for uniqueness and change, we are all out to bring that good change to Lankan golf in future.
The winner will be awarded a trophy and a chash prize of Rs 100,000 while cash awards will be given to top 30 golfers.

Battling the internal enemy
A friend of mine told me I am not sure of your conclusion that we cant handle many things at once. GoSL is wasting millions of money and hours in utterly useless things. It needs to priorities and first implement the mandate given to them. As for CTF, rather than acknowledging its recommendations GoSL has rejected them from the very beginning and denied ownership.
I stood ground and argued back we cannot agree now to foreign judges and I have repeatedly suggested majority Tamil speaking judges to be used from a selected pool. Why are they against that He answered, The issue is not judges. The judicial system itself is corrupt and is not geared to punish war crimes or crimes against humanity. Therefore, the call for special courts and international judges is valid. Any selection in Sri Lanka will be done by the government which is hell bent to safeguard war heroes'. The most important point is the call for international jurisdiction comes from TAMIL VICTIMS. If we can suggest a better way, we need to engage with victims and discuss with them and find a way forward. Even the recent UN fact finding mission found massive flaws in the judiciary and security forces THAT DEFINITELY NEED REFORM.
Democratic revolution
Yes we need reforms but we cannot dismiss the democratic revolution made by the people in this country. Nobody could believe a sitting Executive President who mobilized the majoritist establishment in fascistic manner could be defeated. Yet that happened due to the mass intervention led by mostly professionals including lawyers. Latter played an important role. The mass intervention demolished the fascistic enhancement in judiciary and administration. Pro Mahinda chief justice was thrown out by the Bar association activists. No doubt those armed forces are not cleansed in the same way. But investigation has gone to the level of commodore is inspite of intervention of some leaders.
President Sirisenas Cabinet complains two weeks ago not just for his ministers to hear but for the whole country to know. Not that the likelihood of a silent understanding between the Rajapaksa clan and the higher echelons of the UNP was not known all along, but the President saying it set off a flurry of speculations about the relationship between the President and the UNP, and the future of the unity-government itself. The Presidents complain may not have surprised anyone, but his claim at the Cabinet meeting  that if things were left to him he would have done everything in three months, is not viable. We remember that in October last year President Sirisena publicly took to task officials in the CID, FCID and the Bribery Commission for their allegedly disrespectful handling of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and Navy Commanders over allegations of abuse of authority and financial misdemeanours in Avant-Garde enterprise.
Political calculations are considered to be the main reason for the general lack of progress in corruption investigations, even total inaction in some instances.
It is commonly suspected that the UNPs calculation in protecting the Rajapaksas and giving them political space is to keep the SLFP divided and benefit the UNP electorally. On the other hand, President Sirisena, protecting military officials from investigation is necessary to counter the patriotic claims of the Rajapaksas. Some say the political hypocrisy in this triangular relationship is quite transparent. What may not be readily apparent is the cultural common ground over corruption for which all of us are responsible.
War is a man-made disaster that demolishes civilizations made by unknown generations. In the end what are left are not just death, injuries and destruction, but undying suspicion and distrust. To heal, it will take time but great leaders with humanistic ethics could do wanders. They have to stand against plunder and exploitation creating the need to communication, understanding.
Faith can be created in the modern world by standing for equality, autonomy and the right of self determination; and then only sense of correcting the wrong done to a community is possible. In this venture, Lankan Government is harassed and beaten by a fascistic majoritist group making it faltering, despite promises to its own people, as well as to the international community.
Lankas three-decade war between basically Sinhala soldiers and Tamil guerrilla military organisation arouse because Lankan government failed to address the grievances of Tamil speaking people. It was seen as a conflict between major Sinhala nationality and the minor Tamil nationality. Tamil clandestine army was named Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the war killed an estimated 100,000 civilians, left many more injured and displaced, and widened a seeming unbridgeable rift between the minority Tamil nationality, and majority Sinhala nationality.
United Nations Human Rights Council
After an October 2015 pledge to the United Nations Human Rights Council to address justice and accountability, Lankas Government in 2016 embarked on a nation-wide consultation to find ways to deliver answers. The Government entrusted the task to an 11-member Consultation Task Force (CTF), representing a cross-section of Lankas ethnic, regional, and religious groups. Nearly half of the team, including the head of the CTF, was women. The consultation process was a complicated one.
The CTF recruited representatives of local civil society, political, feminist, healthcare and religious leaders as Zonal Task Force members (ZTF), who could conduct consultations on the ground across the various districts and provinces. These findings were accepted as valuable to indicate how human rights and social-economic rights should be improved in a new constitution. However, pressing need was to propose a new constitution sans executive presidency but with a substantial devolution giving power over land and police to the provincial councils. This was undertaken by the investigation carried out by Lal Wijenaike committee. People participated with many valuable proposals. On this basis under the leadership of the Prime Minister discussions are continuing in order to bring a proposal for a new constitution; to be debated in the constitutional council.
Hence it is incorrect to say that Lankan Government has let the important initiative of the CTF to languish. Officials travelling abroad boast about the consultation process and herald it as a signal of the Governments determination to abide by the Human Rights Council resolution.
However, it has to come behind the effort to resolve Tamil national problem and the problem of executive president. Government report by CTF is not banished into silence. Meanwhile many task force members, both national and zonal, are absorbed in the struggle against fascistic Mahinda group. While many joined the effort with a fair degree of commitment, they are aware that the Lankan State had undertaken many commissions of inquiry which in the end led to no redress so far.
A CTF member described both the exhilaration of the process and the attendant disappointment: The consultations gave way to an amazing non-patronizing community of supportthe best thing about the experience is that people had ideas. But by January 2017, I was wondering: what the hell ZTF members, particularly community leaders who have spent years building relationships of trust, feel they are bearing the brunt of public rage over the lack of action. They feel exposed, and are confronted daily by their communities, yet another failed promise but this time by trusted local leaders. They are very angry with us, people have lost their faith, even with me, one ZTF member told Human Rights Watch. And now, I also have lost faith.
This disappointment is due to misunderstanding of the political crisis. Lankan government is struggling against an internal enemy fed by fascistic ideas. There are sabotage actions taking place throughout the country. Some are obvious some are very subtle.
Facing this menace Yahapalanaya is struggling to satisfy UN human rights conditions. The Government of Lanka has publicly acknowledged the findings of the consultation report and ensures that its recommendations are appropriately implemented through robust justice mechanisms.

Brexit: Tough negotiations ahead
Negotiations on Britains exit from the European Union (EU) took place in Brussels this week. Talks were stalled soon after they began due to differences. European Union Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier charged that Britain has come unprepared for the talks.
In their first meeting Barnier agreed with British Brexit Secretary David Davis agreed that the exit process and terms must be negotiated before talks on the future relations between Britain and the European Union could be discussed. Davis left in few minutes and talks were continued by officials.
EU has insisted that three issues should be given priority in the negotiations and that they must be taken together and not in isolation. They are 1) financial settlement 2) rights of EU citizens in the United Kingdom and 3) Northern Ireland border.
EU has estimated the amount Britain would have to pay for commitments to the EU at around  100 billion. Britain, however, is not ready to pay that amount. In fact it has so far not considered financial settlement seriously though Brexit Secretary Davis has acknowledged its commitment to pay.
EU also insists that its citizens in the UK must be granted the same status that they enjoy now even after Brexit, It will maintain the status quo of UK citizens in the EU even after Brexit, said Barnier.
The UK, however, proposes to grant settled status to EU citizens after five years of residence. There are 3 million EU citizens in the UK.
Britain is facing a difficult situation at the Brexit talks. It is not only the financial settlement that is its worry. EU says that after leaving the EU Britain would not have the privilege of internal market rules in its trade with the EU and British exports to EU would be subject to custom duties in the 27 member countries of the EU transport costs also would soar. Barnier warned that it would not be possible for Britain to keep all benefits of the common market after they leave. No sector by sector participation is also possible, he added.
Time is also a constraint on the negotiations. With or without any agreement Britain will have to leave the EU on March 29, 2019- two years after Britains decision to leave was communicated to the EU. Time flies, said Barnier.
EU is also apprehensive of a change in Government in Britain before the exit date. Hence it desires some participation by the Opposition in the talks. This is especially because of the internal divisions within the Conservative party.
Iran fulfills JCPA commitments
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has certified that Iran has followed to the letter all commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPA) agreed by Japan with five permanent members of the UN Security Council -the United States, China, Russia, United Kingdom, France- and Germany on July 14, 2015 during the second term of the Obama presidency.
According to the agreement Iran pledged to restrict certain aspects of its nuclear development programme and the other party agreed to remove all nuclear related sanctions on Iran. The agreement does not prevent Iran from proceeding with its ballistic missile programme.
During his election campaign President Trump pledged to withdraw from the agreement.
However, that would have meant the US reneging on the Agreement which would place it in an embarrassing position as an unreliable State party to international agreements.
The certification by the AEIA and the advice of senior officials of the administration compelled President Trump to reluctantly certify that Iran has fulfilled its obligations. Yet he imposed new sanctions on Iran contrary to the undertaking given in the JCPA.
These sanctions include listing several individuals and certain entities including the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as terrorist.
North Korea ignores call for talks
North Korea has ignored the call of South Korean President Moon Jae to hold military talks between the two Koreas last Friday (21) as a means of lessening the tension in the Korean peninsula. North Korea insists on the ending of joint US-South Korea military exercises as a pre-condition for talks with the South. President Moon promised to engage the North in dialogue during the election campaign. The offer for talks was made subsequent to North Korea successfully testing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, which has earned the wrath of the United States, Japan and most countries of the world. It is the fifth in a series of nuclear tests it conducted recently. President Moons call is in contrast with the policy of the former South Korean regimes practice of imposing sanctions on the North in retaliation for the latters nuclear tests. President Moon Jae has said that the offer stands and called upon the North to respond. US President Donald Trump, on the other hand, has even threatened to use all options, including military strikes to halt North Koreas nuclear development programme.
North and South Korea technically at war as no peace treaty was signed between the two Koreas at the end of the Korean War.

CEA wont accept EIA reports
Expert panelon Uma Oya Project:
Questions regarding panels honesty and professional integrity:
Certain inaccurate information at media briefing:
The Central Environment Authority (CEA) yesterday informed the expert panel which prepared the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) on the Uma Oya Multipurpose Project that it would not accept any EIA reports or any other reports directed to the Authority until a full investigation is carried into their statements on the Uma Oya Project. In a letter sent to the panel, the Authority noted that their statements have given rise to questions regarding the panels honesty and professional integrity.
They have mentioned certain inaccurate information in a media briefing they held on Thursday (20). The CEA is conducting an inquiry into that and until such time, the CEA will not accept any EIA report prepared by that team,said CEA Chairman Prof. Lal Mervin Dharmasiri speaking to Daily News.
The Expert Panel headed by Senior Professor of Zoology of the University of Sri Jayawardenapura, Swarna Piyasiri, and senior Professor of Engineering of University of Peradeniya, K.D.W. Nandalal had stated to the media that their EIA on the project in 2009 had clearly indicated the possibility of a drawdown of groundwater through weaker zones into the tunnel affecting domestic and irrigation activities in the surroundings.
The CEA in their letter pointed out that that the report submitted to them simply indicated that there might be a slight possibility of a drawdown of groundwater through weaker zones but that it would not have a significant impact on the groundwater level of the area.
Furthermore,the panel had stated that they recommended that the the CEA continuously monitor groundwater level fluctuations in the area around the tunnel trace, especially along major fracture zones connected to the tunnel during construction and operational stages.
But, the CEA point out that the panel seem to not know the mandate of the Authority, The CEA is only responsible for the recommendation of approvals or proposals and not for the implementation of projects. Furthermore, the CEA having studied the EIA identified a possible groundwater drawback and included the continuous monitoring of groundwater as one of the conditions for approval,the letter stated. The expert panel consisted of 19 consultants; a hydro geologist, a tunnel engineer, soil scientist,water quality expert, archaeologist, irrigation engineer, fauna and flora geologist agronomist, infrastructure engineer, resettlement expert and an electrical engineer.
Centre for Human Rights Rajith Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon had earlier written to the CEA as well as the Vice Chancellor of the University of Sri Jayawardenapura asking that these academics be blacklisted for their false EIA report. In June of this year, residents of Bandarawela staged a protest as the Uma Oya project had drained all their water sources. Furthermore, the project had to be suspended due to a leak of close to 80 million litres of water per day through its tunnels and was causing the houses and surrounding ground areas to cave in.

Dengue eradication at fisheries harbours
The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry on Thursday launched a mosquito eradication programme in all fisheries harbours concurrent to the National Dengue Prevention Programme.
Accordingly, the ministry and Fisheries Harbours Corporation jointly implemented the dengue eradication programme. It was launched in 20 fisheries harbours. The programme commenced from Dikowita Fishery Harbour premises, Wattala.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, State Minister Dileepa Wedaarachchi and others participated.
It is planned to carry out such programmes every week in due course.
Minister Mahinda Amaraweera addressing the media said there was a large number of abandoned fishing vessels in fisheries ports and a majority of them were Court productions.
They have become dengue mosquito breeding grounds for many years. The minister said over 181 such fishing boats are at the fisheries harbours at present. The Fisheries Ministry has received this information from a field survey carried out by the Fisheries Department.
Steps will be taken to destroy or remove them on the advice of the Attorney General, the minister said.
The minister added that the relevant letter will be submitted soon to obtain the approval of the Attorney General. He said the release of plastic waste to oceans is a serious environmental problem. Many empty plastic bottles enter the fisheries harbour premises through the breakwater.
According to Dikkowita Fishery Harbour data, a total of 50,000 bottles were removed from the Dikowita Fisheries Harbour. It was revealed that at least one plastic bottle had been released at least one and two hours a day.
The minister said steps should be taken to minimize the use of plastic and releasing them into the ocean, and to take legal action against culprits.

Horton, Sun clash gets world champs off to a bang
Budapest: Australias Mack Horton and Chinas Sun Yang will resume their bad-tempered rivalry in the pool when the swimming section of the world aquatic championships starts on Sunday.
Horton ended Suns four-year domination of the 400m freestyle event in spectacular style at last years Rio De Janeiro Olympics after branding Sun a drug cheat in the build-up. Sparks are expected to further fly with both also registered to swim over 200m, 800 and 1500m freestyle in Budapest. Mack is looking forward to it, Swimming Australia chief executive Mark Anderson said ahead of Sundays opening 400m showdown.
Hes in good form. Not only in the 400m but the 1500m. There will be great entertainment in both of those races and the swimming world will be watching with interest, added Anderson with a large dose of understatement. The 800m freestyle will be an especially intriguing battle with Italys long-distance expert Gregorio Paltrinieri also in the mix.
Horton and Sun will be battling to be the fastest from Sunday mornings 400m heats into the evenings final and their grudge War in the Water rematch will take star billing at Budapests Duna Arena.
Hungarys Iron Lady Katinka Hosszu will be out to maintain her grip on the 200m and 400m individual medley events she has dominated in recent years. Hosszu has entered six individual events, including the 100m backstroke -- one of three events in which she won Olympic gold last year -- in a punishing schedule, but her priority will be defending her 200m and 400m medley crowns. Expect fireworks over the longer distance after Hosszu took two seconds off the world record over 400m when she struck Olympic gold in Rio last year.
By (the time of the world championships) I will know each and every little stone of the Duna Arena, said Hosszu. This pool is so beautiful, that it also puts a little pressure on us Hungarians though. Its up to us, now we all have to swim fast.
China, third in the medals table in swimming events in 2015 in Kazan, will also look to backstroker Fu Yuanhui to defend her 50m title.
A hilarious video went viral of Fus reaction after discovering she had won joint bronze over 100m at the Rio Olympics and the 21-year-old will be hoping for more goofy smiles in Budapest.
The USA, a powerhouse in the pool, will bring a young team -- with an average age of 22 -- shorn of stars Michael Phelps, who has retired again, and Missy Franklin, who sits out Budapest after surgery on both shoulders last year.
Teenagers Regan Smith, 15, and 17-year-olds Robert Finke and Dakota Luther will race in the backstroke, freestyle and butterfly respectively. Katie Ledecky, the Stars and Stripes gold-medal and record-breaking machine, will be the star attraction in Sundays 400m freestyle womens heats and finals.
Such is Ledeckys form that she raced her male counterparts -- including 2012 Olympic champion Nathan Adrian -- during the American pre-Budapest camp.
She was racing the guys in training camp, and they were doing all they could not to lose. It was nuts, team-mate Lilly King revealed. They were the Olympic freestylers. It was crazy.
Expect Ledecky to challenge her own 400m, 800 and 1500m freestyle world records in Budapest.
Britains Adam Peaty looks to be a shoo-in for the 50m and 100m breaststroke titles -- and also wants to lower his own world records in both events. Im half a second quicker if not more than Rio. I want to go and get my titles again, push down on the world records. Its all achievable, Peaty told news.oc.uk.
Peaty is threatening to be the first under the 57 seconds barrier over 100m with South Africas Cameron van der Burgh pushing him hard.
There promises to be a battle royal in the womens 100m freestyle with Swedens Sarah Sjostrom having narrowly missed Cate Campbells world record of 52.06secs.
Australias Campbell is sitting out Budapest, but her sister Bronte is the reigning world champion.
However, the names to beat are Simone Manuel of the USA and Canadas Penny Oleksiak, who tied for gold in Rio last year. AFP

Investing in innovation
Necessity, they say, is the Mother of Invention. This is true of most of the things that we take for granted today, from aircraft to radio. Today, Sri Lanka is faced with an acute dengue crisis. Everyone has to chip in to resolve this crisis of epidemic proportions. We have to think outside the box to tackle this issue.
This is where Research and Development come in. Sri Lankan doctors are now working on introducing drugs such as Rupatadine to control the menace, while biological solutions such as Bti have been proposed. On a worldwide scale, efforts are being made to launch a dengue vaccine. A recent report projected that a successful dengue vaccine could have a market worth US$ 1,250 million by 2027.
While a vaccine may take a few more years to be commercially available in Sri Lanka, there are far simpler steps that we can take to control the spread of the deadly disease. The key to eradicating dengue from our midst is eliminating the breeding grounds of the mosquito that acts as the vector. This is not a very costly task.
However, not all nooks and crannies in a house, building or garden can easily be seen as access could be limited. An overhead rain gutter is a good example. And climbing onto such structures to look for the mosquitos breeding sites may be dangerous.
Enter Chirantha Guruge, a Public Health Inspector (PHI) attached to the Galle Municipal Council who has produced an instrument which helps to detect the dengue mosquito, Aedes aegypti and indeed, any other mosquito species. Guruge says his instrument helps to easily detect the dengue mosquito found in gutters, concrete slabs, toilet pits and higher elevations in homes and buildings.
Introducing his novel creation at the Galle Municipal Council premises, Guruge said he used a vehicle reversing camera battery, monitor, aluminium pipe and a battery charger to make his instrument. The production cost was only around Rs.10,000. It can be used to detect mosquitoes to a height of about 20 feet. The instrument has easy mobility as it could be hung on the shoulder.
However, the instrument in its current form is not perfect. For instance, it has no recording facility. Guruge told reporters that he could further develop with novel features if a person and/or institution comes forward to assist him. Most inventions in Sri Lanka never really see the light of day due to the lack of commercialization. We see very good inventions on television and in newspapers, but there is no progress beyond that initial bout of publicity.
The Sri Lanka Inventors Commission (SLIC) and other related agencies must intervene to further test and commercialise Guruges very useful invention. There is no doubt that a number of companies will be interested in refining and commercializing this product. One advantage of commercialization is that it gives the producer economies of scale, which leads to a lower price for the final product in a few months. We need all the resources we can muster to fight dengue and this invention would be a valuable asset.
The Government has recognized the important role played by inventors like Guruge. Last year, the Cabinet decided to designate October 26 as National Inventors Day. Incidentally, October 26 is the birthday of one of Sri Lankas most respected inventors Dr. A.N.S. Kulasinghe.
The SLIC does an exemplary job in holding the Sahasak Nimavum (literally 1,000 Inventions) exhibition which showcases products and inventions by Sri Lankans from all age groups and all walks of life. In fact, some of the best inventions seen recently have been submitted to the exhibition by schoolchildren. Some of these inventions have since been turned into commercial products. Sri Lankans have regularly won Gold and Silver medals at the International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva (Salon des Inventions de Genve). Among the recent award winning inventions presented in Geneva by Sri Lankans were: A Rail Gate Control System Using Fuzzy Logic, Peripheral Nerve Stimulator Needle with Extended Function, Smart Jacket and Safety Coconut Husk Feeding Mechanism to Extract Bristol Fibre from the Traditional Fiber Extraction Process. These are diverse inventions that serve a variety of useful functions.
It is also important to obtain patents here and abroad for the work of our inventors, before someone from another country copies or patents a similar product. Once a patent is obtained, no other individual or company can lay a claim to that particular invention.
By focusing too much on theoretical subjects, our schools and universities could be veering children away from hands-on subjects and creative thinking. The latter is especially required for creating inventions. Many Government servants too could be having hidden creative and innovative talents which do not emerge to the surface due to the often stifling nature of bureaucracy, bound by AR and FR. The heads of Government institutions must encourage their subordinates to be innovative and creative. After all, such innovative ideas could eventually save time and public funds which can be channelled to diverse development and welfare projects.

Kaurs 171 leads India past Australia, into World Cup final
DERBY: India stunned defending champions Australia by 36 runs to secure a spot in the Womens World Cup final after an undefeated 171 by Harmanpreet Kaur provided the platform for victory on Thursday.
With their first win over six-time champions Australia in World Cup knockout cricket, India will now play tournament hosts England in the sold-out Lords final on Sunday.
"Harman's innings was exceptional and the bowlers have done really well. Winning a semi-final against Australia is a huge achievement," said India skipper Mithali Raj.
Australia, set 282 to win and what would have been a record World Cup chase if successful, got off to a terrible start as they lost three wickets inside the opening eight overs.
Despite some impressive hitting from Elyse Villani, who recorded her best ODI score of 75, they were never able to keep up with the required run rate and were dismissed for 245 with 11 balls to spare.
"Congratulations to India. We didn't get the start we wanted and lost too many wickets through the middle," said Australia captain Meg Lanning.
"We haven't really nailed a full game. We've had glimpses with the ball."
Earlier, Kaurs unbeaten 171 - her third ODI century, which came off just 115 balls and included 20 fours and seven sixes - underpinned Indias 281 for four.
India, who reached their only previous final in 2005, had experienced a disappointing start of their own as they sunk to 101-3, including the dismissal of inspirational captain Raj for 36.
However, Kaur, 28, revitalised the innings with a rapid fourth-wicket partnership of 137 with all-rounder Deepti Sharma.
Kaur, who scored her first hundred outside of India, was named player-of-the match. In a match reduced to 42 overs after heavy rain delayed the start until 13:45pm (1245 GMT), India looked likely to score under 200 until Kaur cut loose.
India, calling on their knowledge of the pitch, having won all four group stage matches they contested at Derby, decided to bat first after winning the toss.
However they were left in a perilous position when opener Smrti Mandhana (six) departed in the first over and Punam Raut (14) joined her in the pavilion not long after.
Kaur took on the role of aggressor as she and Raj made steady progress, before leg-spinner Kristen Beams bowled Raj for 36 having been dropped the previous delivery.
Kaur continued to attack in a merciless display of hitting, requiring 26 balls to move from her half-century to triple figures, when she was almost run out scampering a two to reach the landmark. That scare and the wicket of Sharma did little to deter her, using only 18 balls to then bring up her 150, as India smashed the final six overs for 79 runs.
India then had a dream start with the ball as Shikah Pandey bowled Beth Mooney (one) and Jhulan Goswami dislodged Lannings stumps, for the Australian captains first duck since August 2014.
When in-form Nicole Bolton was caught and bowled for 14 by Sharma, Australia were left teetering on 21-3.
Villani kept Australia within touching distance of the chase with a commanding 75 off 58 balls but her departure, dragging Rajeshwari Gayakwad to Manhana, ended those hopes.
Ellyse Perry became the tournaments top scorer during her 38 but guided Pandey to wicketkeper Sushma Verma to prompt a collapse.
A brutal 90 from Alex Backwell proved in vain as Sharma bowled her to end the semi-final and spark rapturous scenes.  AFP

Lack of PHIs hinders dengue eradication campaigns
The Puttalam district has only 49 Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) but the district needs over 86 PHIs. The Kurunegala district has a shortage of 14 PHIs.
The inadequate public health officers is a main reason for aggravating the dengue menace and other mosquito-related diseases in the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts.
At present the NWP deploys PHIs from other districts to cover up the shortage. Sri Lanka PHIS Association President Upul Rohana said the shortage of PHIs has created severe problems in dengue eradication programmes in many districts.

Mexico, Jamaica into Gold Cup semi-finals
Los Angeles Friday: Defending champion Mexico claimed the final semi-final berth in the CONCACAF Gold Cup with a 1-0 win over the offensively-challenged Honduras national team Thursday at the University of Phoenix Stadium.
Rodolfo Pizarro scored the only goal of the contest in the fourth minute, finishing off a nice passing series in front of the Honduras goal as Mexico took another step towards trying to win a record-extending eighth Gold Cup championship.
Orbelin Pineda started the play on the left side with a short back pass to Jesus Duenas, who redirected across the front of the goal to the back post, giving Pizarro an easy tap in.
Mexico advances to Sundays semi-final to set up a rematch of the 2015 final against Jamaica, who punched their ticket earlier in the day with a 2-1 win over Canada. Mexico and Jamaica faced each other in the group stage where they played to a 0-0 draw.
The semi-final will take place at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.
The USA and Costa Rica will square off in the other semi-final at AT&T Stadium on Saturday in Dallas, Texas.
Honduras is eliminated from the Gold Cup after failing to score a goal in four games. Their only win came when French Guiana had to forfeit their game in the group stage after they fielded an illegal player.
Mexico reached the semis despite fielding a B-team roster that includes just one player from their fourth place Confederations Cup squad.
The seven-time tournament champions Mexico are now unbeaten in 10 consecutive Gold Cup contests.
Mexico had several opportunities to add to their goal total, but either failed to get a shot on goal or the Honduras defense broke up the scoring chance.
Honduras had one last chance to equalize in the 93rd minute on a free kick but the ball sailed wide and deep, leaving them without a clear shot on net.
Honduras coach Jorge Luis Pinto said he was proud of the way his team competed.
I am not happy but somehow satisfied, said Honduras coach Jorge Luis Pinto. We won in behavior in the Gold Cup even if we didnt score or win.
- Figured it out - (strap)
Earlier Thursday, goals in each half from Shaun Francis and Romario Williams secured victory for the Reggae Boyz.
It wasnt easy, said Jamaican goalkeeper Andre Blake. Canada is a very good team. When we got the second goal I think we lapsed a little bit. They scored a beautiful goal. We figured it out and we won the match.
Jamaica got off to a dream start at the University of Phoenix Stadium when Francis scored after only six minutes.
Forward Darren Mattocks pounced on a stumble from Canada defender Steven Vitoria and darted into the area before squaring for Francis, who thumped his finish high into the roof of the net.
Mattocks almost doubled Jamaicas lead shortly afterward only for his shot to be well blocked by goalkeeper Milan Borjan.
Canada striker Cyle Larin went close six minutes before the break but his shot was parried to safety by Andre Blake.
Jamaica doubled their lead five minutes into the second half with a sublime goal from Williams.
The Charleston Battery forward picked up Mattocks layoff before curling his shot from outside the area beyond Borjan.

N. Korean economy grows at fastest pace in 17 years
SOUTH KOREA: Despite global sanctions over its weapons programmes, North Korea's economy grew at the fastest pace in 17 years thanks to a jump in exports and increased production in mining and other industries, the South's central bank said Friday.
The Bank of Korea (BOK) said the North's gross domestic product grew 3.9 percent last year -- the fastest since 1999 when it expanded 6.1 percent.
The hermit state does not officially release its economic data, and the Bank of Korea releases its annual estimates based on data compiled from state and private organisations.
The impoverished North has faced several rounds of UN sanctions over its push to develop nuclear weapons and relies heavily on neighbouring China -- its sole ally and biggest trading partner -- for fuel imports and mining exports.
Production in the mining sector -- which accounts for 12.6 percent of the country's economy -- increased 8.4 percent.
Production at heavy and chemical industries, also a key contributor to the economy, rose 6.7 percent, while overall exports expanded 4.6 percent, partly due to shipments of lucrative mineral resources.
China in February stopped coal imports from the North, facing increasing pressure from US President Donald Trump to tame its unpredictable neighbour, but has continued to trade other commodities including iron and iron ore, providing a lifeline to the isolated regime. China is reluctant to rattle the North's status quo, fearing an influx of refugees and the potential presence of US troops along its border under an unified Korea.
Despite sanctions, the North's economy has expanded due to the recent proliferation of hundreds of state-endorsed private markets where vendors sell everything from food to electronic gadgets imported from China.
Although North Korea denies any plans to reform and claims to be socialist, the regime has gradually opened the door to private enterprise under leader Kim Jong-Un, experts say.
Kim has also ratcheted up the country's nuclear programme, spending heavily to develop missiles that can hit the US mainland.
Analysts estimate that the private sector, broadly defined, could be responsible for anything from a quarter to half of the North's gross domestic product.

No decision to reduce 13-year school academic period: Akila
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam noted that the Education Ministry has not taken any decision yet to reduce the 13-year school academic period by one year. No decision has been taken to reduce the school academic period by one year as the Ministry has taken a policy decision that the 13-year academic period is compulsory for every student, he noted.
However, the Education Commissions resources said that the commission is going to suggest to the Education Ministry to reduce the study period by a year.
Responding to this, Minister Kariyawasam said, a policy decision has been taken to make compulsory of having the 13-year academic period and therefore the suggestion to reduce the study period by one year wont be implemented.
Meanwhile, there is a discussion to hold the Advanced Level and Ordinary Level examinations in December from 2019 aiming to reduce time wastage of students.
It has been estimated that a student can save around seven months from his/her academic period by holding both examinations in December.No sooner the Ordinary Level examination is over, these students can be entered to Advanced Levels promptly without waiting till the following August. As par the current practice,students who sit the Ordinary Level Examination in December have to wait for months probably until next August for the commencement of Advanced Level classes as there are no class rooms, an Education Ministry spokesman said.

No tax exemptions under new Inland Revenue Bill
The Policy of the new Inland Revenue Bill is that there are no exemptions and everybody qualified should pay income tax, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said yesterday. He said his personal opinion is that everybody should be given a income tax number although they pay income tax or not. He added that even the religious institutions should pay tax if they engage in business otherwise no.
Minister Samaraweera made these observations yesterday during a press conference at the Finance Ministry Auditorium.
He said that out of the tax collected, 20 percent is direct tax while 80 percent is indirect tax.
The Minister added that to bring about social justice the indirect tax should be reduced to 60 percent and direct tax should be increased to 40 percent.
Queried by the media, Minister Samaraweera said that there are some doctors engaging in private practice, architects,lawyers and teachers etc who earn massive amounts of money who should pay income tax.
He said that they would find ways to collect those taxes.
Questioned by the media on tax exemption, the Minister said that it was the politicians and officials that granted tax exemptions during previous regimes without any standard. There was no social justice, Minister Samaraweera said.
He further said that JVP MP Anura Dissanayake had said that this government is getting ready to collect income tax from beggars. It is wrong, the Minister said. But,if there are beggars who earn tens of millions, surely they would be taxed. When questioned by the media on certain statements made by the Joint Opposition in this regard, Finance and Media State Minister Eran Wickramaratne said even politicians should pay taxes if they earn.
There is no exemptions to them, the State Minister said.
But the statement that we impose the income tax on the poor is totally wrong. We even have increased the tax free allowance to Rs.1.2 million. It means even those people who earn a Rs.100,000 a month do not need to pay income tax.
He said that discussions are still in progress with all the stake holders and their views would be entertained.
State Minister Wickramaratne said during the Committee Stage debate, the government too would make amendments.
He also said as there are a few cases against the bill before the Supreme Court, the recommendations of the Court would be considered in Parliament.
Minister Samaraweera further said that the Bill would be debated in Parliament during the third week of August and would come into effect from the next tax year.

OJ Simpson granted parole, could be freed in October
Los Angeles: Disgraced American football legend O.J. Simpson, whose 1995 acquittal for double murder polarized the nation, was granted his release from prison Thursday after serving nearly nine years behind bars for armed robbery.
A four-member parole board in the western US state of Nevada voted unanimously to free the 70-year-old Simpson after a tense public hearing broadcast live by news networks.
An emotional Simpson, who bowed his head and mouthed thank you to the parole commissioners, could walk free as early as October 1.
Ive done my time, you know he told the parole board, which deliberated in private for just 30 minutes before announcing its decision. Ive done it as well and as respectfully as I think anybody can.
Simpson was found not guilty in 1995 of the grisly murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and a male companion, Ron Goldman, in a racially charged case that transfixed America and became known as the Trial of the Century.
But the former National Football League running back and actor was sent to prison in 2008 for his role in an armed robbery the previous year of two sports memorabilia dealers at a Las Vegas resort.
Simpson claimed at his trial that he was just seeking to recover personal items from the dealers and he repeated that explanation on Thursday.
It was my property, he said. I wasnt there to steal from anybody.
Simpson initially did not express any remorse for his actions but eventually offered to the parole board that he was sorry that things turned out the way they did.
I had no intent to commit a crime, he said. If I would have made a better judgment back then, none of this would have never happened.
Simpson appeared before the parole board by videoconference from Lovelock Correctional Center, the medium-security prison where he has been serving his sentence.
Seated behind a plain wooden table, he was wearing standard-issue blue jeans, a light blue button-down shirt, a white T-shirt and white sneakers.
Simpson walked stiffly -- the legacy of his years on the football field -- but appeared to have lost weight and looked healthier than during his last parole board appearance four years ago.
Ive spent nine years making no excuses about anything, Simpson said. My commitment to change is to be a better person.
Right now Im at a point in my life where all I want to do is spend time, as much time as I can, with my children and my friends, he said, before adding jokingly, believe it or not I do have some real friends.
Simpson said he intended to settle in Florida upon his release.
Also present at Lovelock was Simpsons eldest daughter Arnelle, who said she just wants her father to come home and held her hand over her mouth as the commissioners voted one-by-one for his release.
Simpsons sister Shirley wept openly.
Simpson was convicted in October 2008 of armed robbery, assault, kidnapping and other offenses after he and five associates -- two of whom were armed -- ambushed the two sports memorabilia dealers in a casino hotel room.
He was sentenced to a minimum of nine years in prison and a maximum of 33 years.
Bruce Fromong, one of the dealers, testified on Simpsons behalf on Thursday, saying his friend of almost 27 years deserved a second chance.
Im here to say that Ive known O.J. for a long time, Fromong said. I dont feel that hes a threat to anyone out there. Hes a good man.
The other dealer, Alfred Beardsley, died in November 2015.
Speaking to reporters following the decision, Simpsons attorney, Malcolm LaVergne, said he had not been entirely confident going into the hearing that his client would receive parole.
Mr. Simpson is obviously a very polarizing figure, he said. Hes very, very well loved. But also hes held in contempt by a lot of people.
- Fall from grace -
Orenthal James O.J. Simpson shot to fame in the 1970s with the NFLs Buffalo Bills after winning the prestigious Heisman Trophy -- the award for the best player in American collegiate football -- as a running back at the University of Southern California.
He retired from football in 1979 after setting numerous rushing records and went on to become an advertising pitchman and actor (The Towering Inferno, The Naked Gun).
In June 1994, Simpsons 35-year-old ex-wife, Brown Simpson, and Goldman were found stabbed to death outside her Los Angeles home.
Simpson was arrested after a low-speed car chase through Los Angeles that was broadcast live by television stations and watched by millions.
He was acquitted in October 1995 after a nine-month trial, a verdict that was greeted with disbelief by many Americans.
Public views on the African-American athletes guilt or innocence divided sharply along racial lines.
Simpson was subsequently found liable for the deaths in a 1997 civil suit and was ordered to pay damages totaling $33.5 million to the families of the victims.
Simpson has been out of the limelight while behind bars, but fascination with his story lives on.
O.J.: Made in America, a nearly eight-hour documentary about his murder trial, won the best documentary Oscar in February.
And a television mini-series, The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story starring Cuba Gooding Jr as the former NFL star, won nine Emmy awards. AFP

Over 6,000 AIDS experts gather in Paris
FRANCE: Over 6,000 HIV experts gather in Paris from Sunday to report advances in AIDS science as fading hopes of finding a cure push research into new fields.
In their 36-year battle, researchers have always come up short against the virus' guerrilla tactics -- hiding out in human cells and playing dead only to reemerge and attack as soon as treatment is stopped.
Today's research is about finding ways to keep the virus dormant with as few drugs and side-effects as possible.
And, of course, better ways to prevent infection in the first place.
Eradicating the virus from someone, where you completely get rid of every single viral particle, is very difficult, if not impossible, said AIDS expert Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) -- a branch of the US government's National Institutes of Health (NIH).
So what we're focusing more on is... called an ART-free remission, he told AFP -- using the acronym for anti-retroviral therapy.
The new buzzword is functional cure.
Unlike a traditional cure, where the virus is eradicated, the patient would still have HIV in their system.
But the virus would be so weakened that it cannot replicate, or spread to sexual partners, for a prolonged period of time -- researchers hope permanently -- without the need for daily drugs.
Though much improved since their revolutionary arrival in the 1990s, anti-retrovirals have side-effects which can include diarrhoea, skin rashes, nausea, insomnia and headaches.
And providing a lifelong supply to millions of people is a costly affair.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends ART for every one of the 36.7 million people living with HIV today. By 2016, some 19.5 million were getting it, according to UNAIDS.
The cost of treatment, in poor countries, ranges from $85 (74 euros) per person per year, to over $1,200 in cases where the first line of available drugs fail to work.
Worried specialists say the need to switch treatment is now more common as the virus becomes resistant to first-choice medication.
We cannot afford to keep funding an epidemic of this proportion, said Linda-Gail Bekker, HIV vaccine researcher and president of the International AIDS Society hosting the conference in Paris, where lab scientists in 1983 identified the discovered the virus that causes AIDS.
The long-term plan is if we can reduce our treatment pool... through remission, then that will be fantastic, she added.
Among the many promising, but as-yet-elusive strategies being probed, is getting people on medication as soon as possible after infection -- seemingly the best hope, especially in newborns, for long-term remission.
Other hopeful possibilities include injections of virus-fighting antibodies, boosting the patient's own immune system with a so-called therapeutic vaccine, or long-acting injectable forms of ARV, experts say.
Only a few people have achieved drug-free remission to date.
They include a group of 14 patients started on drugs in a French trial within 10 weeks of infection, who were able to stop after three years and have stayed healthy for several years since then.
Two years ago, a French teenager was reported to have been in remission for 12 years after stopping her medication.
In the United States, the so-called Mississippi Baby was in remission for 27 months after being given ART for the first 18 months of life, but the virus rebounded in a major let-down for researchers.
People are realising that no matter what you do, for the most part.... when you stop therapy almost everybody rebounds, said Fauci.
Another research priority is prevention. As work on a vaccine -- the holy grail -- continues furiously in several countries simultaneously, much research is dedicated to the more immediate challenge of reducing infection through sex.
A far cry from the ABC (Abstain, Be faithful, Condomise) message of the 1990s, the new angle of attack includes such interventions as drug-doused vaginal rings and male circumcision to limit virus spread.
And then there is PrEP -- short for pre-exposure prophylaxis, which involves healthy people taking ARVs as protection.
It is an expensive option, but early trials have shown it does lower the risk.
The July 23-26 conference happens amid concerns that funding for HIV research and treatment programmes may be under threat.
US President Donald Trump has proposed to cut the 2018 NIH budget, for example, and not to increase the life-saving PEPFAR AIDS relief fund.
Our extraordinary scientific progress against HIV and our ability to address all of the scientific challenges still before us are threatened by a weakening resolve to fund HIV science, said a conference statement. HIV is not over, added Bekker. With 1.8 million new infections last year, bringing to nearly 40 million the number of people who will need life-long treatment, there is still an epidemic of extraordinary proportions, she said.
If we take our eye off this ball, we will find ourselves backsliding in scary ways.- AFP

Patali Champika tasked with clearing canals
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka has been entrusted with the task of clearing the blocked canals in and around the Colombo city.
The Cabinet Sub-Committee which met on Wednesday has given full authority to Minister Ranawaka in this regard. The minister, who was previously given full authority to ensure proper and efficient garbage disposal in Colombo, had shouldered the task successfully during the past few weeks. The new assignment comes on the heels of this success.
Ranawaka said he would shoulder the task of clearing the canals from today by coordinating with all relevant institutions. Starting from July 5, 754 individuals have been arrested within 14 days for illegal dumping of garbage on the roadside.
Garbage disposal is constantly supervised and daily reviews are conducted at 7 pm at the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) hall with the attendance of Colombo, Moratuwa, Kotte, Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia, Kelaniya and Kaduwela Special Commissioners and the OICs, Engineers, PHIs and garbage collecting private companies namely Abans and Care Cleaning.

Pay special attention to deliver govt. services to NE: Vajira
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena yesterday said the officials should pay special attention to deliver government services to the North and East.
If we are to rehabilitate the people in the North and East, we must guide and support them, Minister Abeywardena said.
He was addressing government officials at Temple Trees recently.
We must remember that earlier they had a system. When they finished their O/Ls and before they go for their A/Ls, they had to undergo three-month military training. Thereafter, they became fighters and when they died, they were buried with great honour and memorials were built in their names and their families looked after, the minister said.
Today they have no system. If we dont change this situation, we automatically become a government that is shown to be lax in the peoples welfare. To prevent this, the President and the Prime Minister has asked that we pay extra attention to them, the Minister said.
The Ministry has launched the third phase of the Nila Mehewara - Presidents Peoples Service - National Programme in Kurunegala, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya and Mannar.
It will take all government services to every divisional secretariat and Grama Niladhari division in the districts for a day to help the people in the area have access to the state services.
The mobile government service deals with issues of birth certificates, NICs, pension, drivers licenses, granting of spectacles, health services, advisory services, land problems, and IDs for the elderly among others. It will provide beauty courses, loan services, employment opportunities, disaster management services, clinics, self-employment opportunities and all other government services.
The first and second phases of the programme were held in Polonnaruwa and Galle.
Reports sent to the President from the District Secretariats of Vavuniya and Kilinochchi had worried the President and he had asked all his Cabinet ministers to pay special attention to develop North and East, the Minister said.
The 30-year-long war had resulted in many people not being used to government services in a long time,
In Kilinochchi, a 60-year-old man applied for a drivers licence for the first time. In the Manthai Divisional Secretariat, around 80km from Mullaitivu, a family received the deed to their land after 70 years. Manthai had not had a visit from a single government agency after 2009, we took 38 agencies that day, the Minister said.
The Oddusudan Divisional Secretariat has 27 grama niladhari divisions, but only 12 have grama niladharis, the rest had retired. New people should be hired immediately, the Minister said.
In the Galle district, 16,205 people were given their NICs during the programme. Around 18,282 people were finally given copies of their marriage, birth or death certificates. In Polonnaruwa, 3,005 people were granted permits or deed to their lands.
Some may think that all these complaints would put the government servants in these areas in trouble, but that is not the case. We must understand the problem. On average it costs a person at least Rs 3,000 to get his NIC done as he goes from one place to another to get it done, the Minister said.
In Kurunegala alone, the District Secretariat had 80,000 applications pending for NICs.
These issues mean that many do not get to vote, Abeywardena said.
The Nila Mehewera thus far has received over a million complaints from people in five districts, the Minister said.
The minister asked the relevant ministries to encourage and praise the officials who render their service to the programme. Thee mobile services are to be rolled out other districts soon.

Preliminary work on land acquisition underway
Kurunegala, Habarana Railway Track::
Preliminary work of the land acquisition for the construction of the proposed new railway line from Kurunegala to Habarana via Dambulla is now underway.
A Sri Lanka Railways Spokesman told the Daily News that the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB) has completed the projects feasibility study while the technical evaluation on the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is also being conducted.
This project expects to provide convenient transportation for people in the Eastern and North Central Provinces and to achieve provincial development aims by connecting the Dambulla Economic Centre with the railway network, he said.
The railway track will serve the dual purpose of passenger transport and transporting of coal, flour and fuel from the Eastern Province to other Provinces.
The spokesman said since transporting these items by roads is costly and creates adverse environmental impacts; this is the suitable option for all sectors.
We need to increase goods transportation by trains as it is the best profitable avenue to the Sri Lanka railways, he said. The project has aimed to minimise the traffic congestion on the Kurunegala-Dambulla road, transport agriculture harvest easily and minimise delays on the Colombo-Batticaloa/Trincomalee rail track.
The project will be implemented considering the EIA to reduce the impacts caused by the proposed road construction to the people living surrounding areas. The railway line will also be constructed avoiding the elephant corridors in Habarana and the surrounding areas.
He said the length of the proposed Kurunegala-Habarana railway line is 84 kilometres and will run across the commercial towns of Dambulla and Sigiriya in the North Central Province.

Papaya leaves to treat dengue patients:
Health Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne had stated that scientific research should be done in order to find out whether it is good to use the juice of Papaya leaves to treat dengue patients, Health Ministry sources said.
According to sources, Minister Senaratne had stated that there is a common belief in Sri Lankan society that the juice is good for dengue patients. The juice is discovered in Sri Lanka. Drugs are being manufactured both in India and in Australia using papaya leave juice. He had stated this during a ceremony held at Sri Lanka Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation in Colombo recently.
Still no scientific findings on this products. But dengue experts and specialists do not accept that the juice is good for dengue patients. The effect of papaya leave juice on dengue patients should be ascertained through scientific research. There are other drugs that cure diseases, the Minister stated.
Ayurvedic drugs do not harm the human body like Western medicine. In last year (2016) US $ 64 billion worth Ayurvedic drugs had been sold in the world. Sri Lanka export Ayurvedic drugs to Switzerland and we need to export drugs to many other foreign countries. Sri Lanka needs to capture the world market, the Minister stated.

part of Colombo Swimming Club demolished:
The Road Development Authority had taken measures to demolish part of the Colombo Swimming Club, yesterday.
The act was carried out following a court order obtained by the authority.
The development took place while the Colombo Swimming Club was in communication with the Lands Ministry and the Highways Minister with regard to the divestiture of the land. The history of the Colombo Swimming Club (CSC) dates back to the 1930s - the colonial era in Sri Lanka.
We were surprised by this turn of events which unfolded early this afternoon, as we had been in communication with both Land Ministry and the Highways Ministry regarding divestiture of this land.
In fact we have received two letters from the Land Ministry dated March 29, 2017 and June 6 2017, that our request was being considered, and that they were awaiting details regarding compensation offered before proceeding to evaluate our request.
We have not received any communication from either the Land Ministry or the Highways Ministry informing us that our request had been rejected, an e-mail, generated by the Colombo Swimming Club management to be circulated among its members, said.
No matter all our explanations and production of documents in our possession, the RDA insisted on executing the court order, without even giving us any time whatsoever to make alternate arrangements or appeal to higher authorities, it also added.
Sources close to the Swimming Club management said they would work with relevant state authorities to resolve the matter.

Richmond  203 years of Excellence
Richmond College, Galle, a premier educational institution in Sri Lanka with an unparalleled history completes 203 years of incessant existence on 25th July 2017. Beginning as the Galle School in 1814 it took a little more than six decades before it was renamed Richmond. During her 203 year long journey she passed several milestones.
With the British subjugating the entire country in 1815 the native monarchy ended. The first missionaries from England were the Baptists and from the Church of Ireland and with the presence of the Anglican Chaplains they all began to actively propagate their brands of Christianity. In 1813, six of the Missionaries of the Wesleyan Methodist Church led by the Rev Dr Thomas Coke to set sail to Ceylon accompanied by William Ault, James Lynch, George Erskine, William Martin Harvard, and Thomas Hall Squance, Benjamin Clough and, John Mckenny destined for Cape of Good Hope. The Rev Dr Coke died at sea on the 2nd of May and committed to the deep the next day. The other missionaries arrived in Bombay and five of them came to the Galle Harbour on 29th June 1814. The governor, General Sir Brownrigg of the country had prior knowledge of their arrival and sent his Brother-in-law the Rev Bisset, the senior Chaplain to meet and confer with the Missionaries and to learn about their future plans and report to him. General Brownrigg on hearing of their plans suggested that they start schools to teach English to the natives while engaging in preaching and was promised pecuniary assistance of fifty Rix dollars (the legal currency at the time) for each school they started. The Governor made this suggestion with foresight. He foresaw the need of an educated native workforce if the country was to be developed and progressed.
The Missionaries held a meeting on 4th July 1814 in the Queens House Galle, the first Wesleyan Methodist Conference heralding the beginning of the Methodist Mission in the country, and by ballot decided the stations for the six missionaries to occupy. William Ault was selected to labour in Batticaloa, James Lynch and Thomas Hall Squance to occupy Jaffna, George Erskine to Matara, and Benjamin Clough to remain in Galle, and William Martin Harvard, to occupy Colombo after his arrival.
Benjamin Clough was visited by the Maha Mudaliyr of Galle, Don Abraham Dias Abeysinghe Amarasekera on 25th July 1814, on hearing that Clough was to start a school soon, he offered his deceased brother Balthazars vacant house to start the school. The house was built in 1712 by the Dutch, in upper Dickson Road, Galle, and was known as Doornberg.
Mission documents record, Mr. Clough, after acknowledging the liberal offer of the Mudaliyr, went to view the premises, which are about a mile from the Fort, and only a stones-throw from the house of the generous proprietor. They are situated in a very retired and romantic spot; and appeared in most respects to be so eligible, that Mr. Clough did not hesitate to accept of the liberal proposal. He immediately had his luggage removed; and was thus, without any expense to the Mission Fund, placed at once in a situation of comfort and respectability; and in circumstances of all others the best; calculated to promote his improvement in the language, and his usefulness among the natives. His school was soon commenced, and attended by some of the most intelligent boys on the island. The date is recorded in the Rev Cloughs journal archived in the library of the School of African-Asian Studies (SOAS), as 25th July 2014.
The school became very popular with more and more natives seeking to study under the Rev Clough. In 1815 the Rev William Harvard joined his brethren in Galle. The Rev Erskine had returned to Galle by this time abandoning his school in Matara due to disinterest by the natives though it was opened with much enthusiasm. The Rev Harvard was to soon move to Colombo as planned earlier.
The Rev Erskine took over from Clough when he left to Colombo with Rev Harvard. A large Dutch built house in Galle was initially taken on rent but later purchased by Erskine on behalf of the Methodist Mission, and the school was moved to Galle Fort. That building is today the main hall of Southlands Girls School. Although no reason is adduced for the relocation in mission records it could be argued that it was due to societal reasons prevailing at the time. The Mission continued to use Doornberg for many more years and billeted the unmarried missionaries who started coming to the country and also it was a temporary abode for missionaries of several other denominations who came to Ceylon in the second decade of the nineteenth century.
In 1816, the Rev John Mckenny too came to Galle failing to secure permission from the Governor to establish a mission in South Africa and joined Erskine. In 1817, the Rev Mckenny established the first Wesleyan Methodist Vernacular School in Bone vista, Unawatuna, Galle which was later abandoned and the Anglican Church took possession and is called the Bone vista School. He then started the second English School of the Galle School in Ja Kotuwa, Mglla together with a female department (in later years it went on to become the Rippon Girls School), a vernacular school and a caste based school at the request of the natives belonging to that caste living around Mglla. He also started the first Anglo-vernacular school in Minuwangoda, Galle and several other schools in the suburbs. All these schools although on different foundations was the same Galle School.
The Methodist Mission opened many more small schools in Galle but the parent School was the Galle School in Fort. The Superintending missionary of Galle supervised the school with locally recruited teachers. It is said that the all scholars sat together and took instructions, irrespective of caste, creed, ethnicity, religion or social standing Richmond can take credit for being the pioneer school to eliminate caste, creed, and ethnic rivalries in schools.
In 1829, Lieutenant-Colonel William MacBean George Colebrooke and Charles Hay Cameron, in 1830, two Royal Commissioners, came to Ceylon to study and report on administrative, financial, economic, and judicial reforms. They submitted five reports between December 1831 and May 1832, and they became the reports of the Commission of Eastern Enquiry. Colebrooke proposed drastic changes to the Civil Service and recommended that the public service should be freely open to all classes of persons according to their qualifications and the government implemented the proposals in 1833. He proposed that the government actively take part in the education and proposed the establishment of a School commission to make policy decisions, on education and supervise all schools in the country to ensure a uniform system of education.
Colebrooke observed that the English missionary societies have formed extensive establishments in various parts of Ceylon, and it would be unnecessary to retain the government schools in situations where English instructions may already be afforded. He also proposed to disallow teaching of scripture during the school hours and suggested it be taught either before or after regular school hours. With this recommendation the government schools conducted by Anglican chaplains were discontinued leaving schools sponsored by other denominations to continue. The School Commission was established in 1834, but soon ran into problems due to inter denominational rivalries on the teaching of the scripture and was discontinued and a new Central School Commission was established in 1841. The first Methodist female School was started by the Rev William Bridgnell in 1842, which is today known as Southlands Girls School. Colebrooke wanted the vernacular schools abolished, but the Methodist Mission did not agree to the proposition. It was after the Central School Commission in 1841 that vernacular education was encouraged again.
The Central School Commission offered a grant to all schools willing to be supervised and conducted according to commission proposals and formed a list of all schools who agreed to the proposition. The Galle Boys and the Girls School on consenting to get the grant, too was taken into the list which was incorrectly interpreted by many as a government takeover. In the history of education in Sri Lanka the government took over schools only in 1962, and not in any other year. Those schools that became eligible to the grant continued to be supervised by the respective sponsoring societies.
The Rev Joseph Rippon who became the superintending Missionary in 1851, purchased an abandoned mountainous property in Galle known as Mount Seymour or the Sillerys Hill in 1857 and sought permission to start a High school, an industrial school, a school for females and a farm. His proposal was not sanctioned but he was asked to move several native schools, the Anglo-vernacular school operating in Minuwangoda and the female school in Magalle to the hill to save the rent paid to private properties in conducting the schools. The School in the Hill was then called the Richmond Hill School and the female branch, the Richmond Hill Girls Boarding School.
The educational system took another decisive turn in 1865 with the discontinuance of The Central School Commission. The government changed its policy of giving the grant to schools based on their performance deviating from the earlier policy of allowing grants on predetermined criteria like student population and the number of tutors. The schools were subject to government inspection and the grant had to be earned based on performance and the progress made. Schools had to be upgraded from their present status if they were to earn an enhanced grant. Thus, many vernacular schools were upgraded to Anglo-vernacular schools and the Anglo-vernacular schools were converted to high schools.
The Rev Rippon returned home in 1861 with his health failing. The Rev Nicholson came after him and pursued the Rev Rippons dream of establishing a high school. In 1863 the Society sanctioned to upgrade the Anglo-vernacular school in the hill to a high school and to rename it as Wesley College. Unfortunately due to pressure from the Colombo elite it was moved out from Richmond Hill, and the Dam Street School was elevated to a high school and is the present Wesley College.
The Rev George Baugh who was serving in Kandy returned home in 1873 with his sick wife who did not survive the voyage and died at sea. He remained in England for some time and having remarried, returned in 1874. He too pursued the Rev Rippons dream of a high School in the hill with perseverance and commitment and it was sanctioned in 1875, to convert the Anglo-vernacular school in the hill to a collegiate School by connecting the Mglla English School and renamed it the Galle High School with the Rev Samuel Langdon at the helm. Six years later, during the tenure of the Rev Samuel Hill he suggested to rename the school to Richmond College.
Under Langdon the school became popular and progressed rapidly. One year after the school was converted to a collegiate school, several Scholars gained entrance to the newly formed Ceylon Medical School in 1877, while several were successful in the Calcutta University examination. Langdon served three years and was transferred to Kandy.
From the beginning of Richmond as the Galle School in 1814 until it was converted to a collegiate School in 1876, the Superintending Missionary of Galle administered the school and he amounted to the Principal.
Beginning with the Rev Benjamin Clough in 1814, as many as twenty-one Missionaries Superintended the School until it was converted to a collegiate institution in 1876. The Rev Samuel Langdon became the first Missionary Principal of the school. The school was vested in the Government in 1962 until which time the school was under the Wesleyan Methodist Mission during which period there were seventeen Methodist Missionary, and three Ceylonese Methodist Principals. The first Buddhist Principal Mr D G Welikala was appointed in 1962. Since then the school has had ten Principals up to the present times. Of all the Principals Richmond had seven were old boys. Mr Claude Ivor de Silva who took care of the school until it was taken over is the oldest living principal now aged 94 years.
For a school to exist uninterrupted for two hundred and three years is a great achievement and being the oldest Wesleyan Methodist School in Sri Lanka and Asia is prestige.
Several Richmond Missionary Principals left an indelible mark in the College History. The Rev Samuel Langdon is credited with introducing Science to Schools in Sri Lanka; the Rev James Hone Darrell Memorial Hall of the college built in 1898 by the Rev Darrell is an engineering marvel that has no pillars to support a high tiled roof and had withstood the test of time for more than a century. The Rev W J T Small is credited for being in the forefront with the Buddhists in the Temperance movement.
In 1876 the Rev George Baughs unremitting efforts to convert the school to a high school paid off and it became a High School. For many years misinterpreting the transformation of the Anglo-vernacular school in Richmond Hill to a High school or a collegiate institute was taken as the beginning of the school. The Methodist Church of Sri Lanka recently made a proclamation correcting the error as seen from the image.

Roger Federer stands tallest of all as Wimbledons history man
Roger Federer cemented his reputation as the greatest player to grace his sport by lifting a record eighth Wimbledon title with a one-sided victory over Marin Cilic, whose thin hopes of an upset were popped by a blister that troubled his movement and tormented his mind.
It was an afternoon of sustained emotions but scant drama. Federer, a great Wimbledon favourite since winning his first title in 2003, raced through the match in one hour and 41 minutes and dropped only eight games in a 6-3, 6-1, 6-4 procession.
This victory meant the Swiss master, who turns 36 next month, surpassed the big-serving American Pistol Pete Sampras and the Victorian-era great, William Renshaw, who claimed seven. Staggeringly, Federer also became the first man to win Wimbledon without dropping a set since Bjorn Borg in 1976. It is very special to win eight titles, said Federer. Wimbledon was always my favourite tournament, and will always be my favourite tournament. My heroes walked the grounds here. Because of them I think I became a better player, too. And No8 obviously means a lot to me because to be part of Wimbledon history is truly amazing.
What made this victory more remarkable still was that the era when Federers racket played like a Stradivarius, and the American writer David Foster Wallace compared watching him to a religious experience, had appeared over for good last year. He was approaching his 35th birthday.
He had not won a Grand Slam since 2012. And, worse still, he was struggling with a knee injury  sustained whilst running a bath for his twin daughters  which forced him out of the game for five months.
But the thousands walking along Church Road to the All England Club for Sundays final understood that the Federer of 2017 was a player miraculously reborn, having won the Australian Open in January and 32 of his 34 matches this year. And so it proved as he dismissed a hobbling Cilic with minimal fuss.
It wasnt supposed to be that easy given the 6ft 6in Cilic was in the form of his life. Few knew, however, that he had a huge blister on his foot after his semi-final against Sam Querrey.
It meant that every time he made a sudden movement it felt like an electric shock up his leg. Understandably it screwed up his mind  and his groundstrokes. I tried to block my thoughts, said the Croatian.
I tried to block the pain. But even in the warm-up I was testing my movement going side to side and I was too slow.
That was evident in his play, with Cilic clanking 23 unforced errors compared to only 16 winners.
Federer did not initially sense anything was wrong with the giant across the net. Even though it was his 11th Wimbledon final it could have been the first given his early nerves.
He served two fidgety double faults in the opening two games and also faced breakpoint at 2-2. The 15,000 inside Centre Centre held their breath. Yet Federer survived and in the next game broke his opponent before running away with the first set.
Cilics movement was increasingly tortured, and at 3-0 down in the second set he called for the trainer, who bandaged him up. It did little good. In a blur he was two sets down and staring into the abyss.
As the third set began, and the clouds were finally burnt off by the sun, the Croatian tried to mix things up by serving and volleying.
But such was the whip and dip in Federers backhand return he was having to play his volleys off his bootlaces.
At this point there was only going to be one winner. By the time Cilic found himself breakpoint down at 3-3 the strained cries of Cmon Marin! were growing in number and intensity. Most of the crowd probably still wanted Federer to win but they also wanted more tennis. He was in no mood to oblige. A decisive break soon arrived, along with this most precious of victories.
Afterwards he repeatedly waved at his four children, three of whom were sat on the balcony above the NBC TV studio transfixed by the applause for their father.
They were surely not the only ones. Thousands of teenagers watching yesterday would not have been born in 2003 when Federer beat Mark Philippoussis to claim his first title.
The good news for us  if not his rivals  is that Federer intends to be back again in 2018. I still love to play and my wifes totally fine with it, he added, smiling.
Shes my No1 supporter. Shes amazing. And because Im playing a little less, I feel like Im working part-time these days, which is a great feeling. The tennis gods have been kind to Federer at Wimbledon this year.
Andy Murray hobbled out with a hip problem. Novak Djokovic was given the elbow by an inflamed joint. And Rafael Nadal was sunk by a 34-year-old Luxemburger, Gilles Mller, who suddenly played the best tennis of his career. But on the evidence of this fortnight Federer would have been tough to topple whoever was on the other side of the net. While this was his 19th grand slam victory, another record, few would bet against more coming his way.
For even now, in the autumn of his career, he stands tallest of all. The eternal  and the immovable.

Seekkuge Prasanna to miss Northants T20 Blast
LONDON: Northants spinner Seekkuge Prasanna will miss the entire 2017 T20 Blast competition with a hamstring injury.
The 32-year-old Sri Lanka leg-spinner had re-signed for the county after playing 11 times in T20 last season. Northants already have South Africa spinner Tabraiz Shamsi lined-up for the next two games as a replacement.
"We have looked for potential replacements but we're going to stick with our own," head coach David Ripley told BBC Radio Northampton.
"It reminds me of when Seekkuge got called up for Sri Lanka last season - we hunted high and low for replacements for five games and in the end we got nowhere.
"Those five games went pretty well for us with our own and then on Finals Day we hoped Seekkuge would be back, he didn't make it but we had people step up to the plate."
Shamsi has already made an impact at Northants in this season's T20 Blast, taking 2-20 against Durham and 2-24 versus Birmingham, helping them to victories in both games.
He was due to cover only the first three games with Prasanna on international duty with Sri Lanka.

SL listed Human Rights Priority Country for second time
Sri Lanka for the second year, has been listed as a Human Rights Priority Country HRPC, by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the United Kingdom. In a report commissioned for the British Parliament, titled, Human Rights and Democracy, Sri Lanka has been commended for the progress it had made on human rights thus far, but still, the report concludes that
much remained to be done.
In the report, an HRPC is qualified by the present human rights situation in the country; the countrys human rights trajectory and UKs ability to influence changes. In reference to Sri Lanka, the reports first reference was the way Sri Lanka has made progress against some of its commitments toward human rights. It applauded Sri Lanka for the establishment of its Office of Missing Persons.
This was an important step towards reconciliation, although it is yet to come into operation, the report stated.
The report also lauded the current Constitutional reforms process underway. The report says, It is hoped that this will address issues of devolution and introduce a Bill of Rights. It also commended the Sri Lankan Government for committing itself to repeal the much criticised Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Yet, although it applauded the countrys efforts regarding Constitutional reforms, reconciliation and the establishment of the OMP, the report also criticized Sri Lanka too. The report singled out Sri Lanka for discrimination against LGBTQ people, specifically the transgender community, adding that inter communal tensions remained a point of concern.
Tensions were fuelled by hate speech by members of extremist nationalist groups, the report stated.
The report also claimed that while the government participated in UNs visits to the country, there was concern about the standard of detention centres and continued cases of torture.
In addition to Sri Lanka, the other countries listed as HRPCs are: Afghanistan, Bahrain, Peoples Republic of Bangladesh, Burma, Burundi, Central African Republic (CAR), China, Colombia, Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (North Korea), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, the State of Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs), Libya, Republic of Maldives, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Yemen, and Zimbabwe.

SLC Presidents XI batting crumble to spin
Gunathilaka, Thirimanne score half-centuries:
Sri Lanka Cricket Presidents XI put up a feeble display of batting against Indian left-arm spinners Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav to collapse from 139-1 to 187 all out on the first day of the two-day practice match played at the CCC grounds yesterday.
By stumps India had replied with 135 for three wickets.
The Presidents XI top order was bolstered by a 130-run stand between Danushka Gunathilaka and skipper Lahiru Thirimanne who both made half centuries.
Gunathilaka struck 11 fours in his 74 scored off 97 balls and Thirimanne a sedate 59 off 125 balls that included two sixes and five fours.
Jadeja broke through for India by dismissing Thirimanne and Dhananjaya de Silva (0) in one over and ran out Gunathilaka to affect the collapse. The rest of the Presidents XI innings folded up tamely with Jadeja picking up four wickets and Yadav three with his left-arm chinaman.
Opener Lokesh Rahul struck a 58-ball half-century (7 fours) before being dismissed. Abhinav Mukund (0) and Cheteshwar Pujara (12) both fell cheaply to Vishwa Fernando but skipper Virat Kohli (34) and Ajinkya Rahane (30) saw India through without any further loss for the day.

SLFPers must note mandate of Party leader, President Sirisena
What appears to be the emerging divisions within the SLFP, possibly posing a threat to the coalition of National Unity that comprises the present government, is a key aspect in the politics of today. The talk is of a group of SLFP members crossing over to function as an independent group in the Opposition, while there is also considerable speculation about a group of MPs from the Joint Opposition (JO) moving over to the government, without the UNP.
These likely manoevres are being heated up due to the approach of next month, which completes two years after the General Election of August 2015, which led to the forming of the Grand Coalition of National Unity which remains today without its grandeur, but as a functioning and necessary coalition.
Those talking much of a possible shift of SLFP members from the government to the Opposition, and even to the JO, point to the disagreements with the UNP, and especially to the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, remaining in this key position in government. No doubt there are issues regarding the powers that SLFP members holding Deputy and State ministerial positions under UNP Ministers, and even aspects of their office premises.
These are inevitable disputes within a coalition, made worse by the fact that most SLFP members came to the government only after the UNP won the larger number of seats in the August 2015 General Election. They are not members who moved to support the Presidency of the Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena after the Presidential Poll of January 2015.
In the August General Election the UNP, led by Ranil Wickremesinghe, emerged as the largest or first party with 93 electoral seats with 45.66% votes, and 106 parliamentary seats with the National List members. The SLFP, within the UPFA, led by President Maithripala Sirisena emerged next or second with 83 electoral seats with 42.33% votes, and 95 parliamentary seats with National List members.
What those from the SLFP within the government who are now leading the call for a break from the UNP-SLFP coalition, do not realize is that the present National Unity government they are in, as a coalition, is mainly due to the national mandate given by the people to President Maithripala Sirisena to be President in January 2015. He remains the head of any government that is to function under his term of office, which he has reduced to five years.
The government of National Unity emerged under his leadership, and the position of Prime Minister, also follows the January 2015 mandate of the people, which did not get the support of these SLFP members.
It is good to recall that in his manifesto for the January 2015 Presidential Poll, Maithripala Sirisena clearly stated who would be the Prime Minister under his presidency. As he states in the first chapter  My Vision  in the manifesto:  to carrying on this programme by a National Government comprising members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the United National Party and the Jatika Hela Urumaya. The present Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, shall be appointed Prime Minister of this National Government. The peoples mandate did come for that position.
Not much strength
This does not give much strength to the SLFP members in government to make a major push to call for a government without the UNP, although they may have good political and populist reasons for doing so. They must also remember that President Sirisena, as the head of the SLFP, clearly refused to endorse Mahinda Rajapaksa as a Prime Ministerial candidate of the UPFA in August 2015, and even said that if MR comes to a situation of claiming that position, he would appoint someone else. While the cheap politicking of many who did not win election by votes, but came in through the back way of the National List, may give a good public show off when the government is facing many issues causing public concern, it will be good for them to be aware of their own personal weaknesses, and dependence on President Sirisena for the positions they hold in politics and governance today.
While making public statements about jumping from the Government to the Opposition  Joint or Independent  they should also take note of the weaknesses the JO is facing today. While the JO leader Mahinda Rajapaksa keeps postponing the Full Moon when the government will be overthrown, there is considerable uncertainty within the JO on its functioning. It cannot meet the call by a section of the Sangha to move away from Constitution drafting, it is definitely on the back foot on the SAITM issue, and is faced with a new image problem over Uma Oya.
The JO is a shaky political outfit. This is seen with Wimal Weerawansas National Freedom Front (NFF) moving out of it to function independently. This is a leader and a group that has different political goals, than the JO can commit itself to. And, there is also that single MP, Roshan Ranasinghe moving out to be independent of the UPFA. In such situations, the anti-government and anti-UNP voices of the SLFPers within the government, who do not criticize President Sirisena, had better give ear, first to the call by the President to be patient till December 31, and next to the mandate that President Sirisena received to form the National Government in January 2015.
The twirl of politics may give them many tempting possibilities. Yet, despite considerable public dissatisfaction, and even anger, at the policies of the government, especially the delay in fighting corruption, there are no signs of a readiness to accept those whom the people rejected twice in 2015.
There is more time under this Presidency and Government, for a new public campaign and organisation to emerge with the necessary political thinking to change the government, and possibly, the political system in Sri Lanka.
SAITM  the real issue
The government has got over a part of the SAITM issue with the transfer of ownership of the Neville Fernando Hospital to the State. The GMOA will no doubt keep shouting its objections about this, as it tries to continually confuse the people over what the real SAITM issue is. What is necessary is for the government to come to grips with the issue of how students who have passed the GCE O and A levels, with the requirements to enter the state medical faculties, but fail to enter these institutions due to lack of space, will be given the opportunity of medical education.
The question of extending private education facilities to medicine is the key issue that calls for quick and clear action by the government. Hardly any government voice commenting on the SAITM issue goes into this matter. Very little is asked as to how the GMOA accepts foreign private education for those who cannot enter local state medical training facilities.
There is hardly anything said about the District Quota system on the selection of students for medical education, which echoes the hardships that Tamil students from the North had in seeking higher education, not so long ago. Such restrictive district quota systems have no place in a democratic society, and should not hamper growth of the medical profession. These matters need a free and clear public discussion, which will push the GMOA much more back, than a Graded Medical Officers Association (a rival GMOA). The need is not to divide the medical profession, but resolve the issue of all students seeking medical education.
The government will also have to address the situation caused by the strike by medical students for the past five months, which is now being raised by the GMOA, which encouraged them to boycott lectures. While a sympathetic approach could be useful, there is also the necessity to remind these students of the consequences of being absent from lectures and practicals for such a long period.
The disciplinary approach to this should not be excluded, while leaving room for sympathetic consideration. It is good to remember that very soon there will be another intake of students to the medical faculties, and the current boycott of classes by students could lead to a major delay in the new admissions.
It is good to underscore the biggest shame for the GMOA was how it made Prof Carlo Fonseka, such a senior medical professional, at 84 plus years, and a teacher to most doctors today, having to worship the GMOA leaders (possibly his students, too), in asking them not to strike over his role in the SLMC, in the midst of the current Dengue epidemic.
Prison visitors
It is interesting to see the moves to have new conditions to restrict foreign professionals, who are officially on investigative visits to this country, from visiting the prisons and prisoners. The national prisons are kept out of the Defence institutions for very good democratic reasons. Whatever action the government may take on future prison visitors, what is important is to understand that having persons in prison detention, in remand or as suspected terrorists, for many years without any charge or trial, is certainly unacceptable in a democratic society, and especially in a society that claims to give importance to Human Rights.

Small farmers can help revive rural economy: PM
Helping small farmers will revive our rural economy, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
The Prime Minister was speaking as chief guest at the inaugural ceremony for Lanka Livestock 2017.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that without modernising the small farmer and helping him grow, the economy would remain stagnant.
He made a special plea to those in the private sector, explaining that it would play a major role in this economic revitalisation programme.
After his speech, and a larger introductory ceremony that included a traditional Sri Lankan dance performance and certificates of appreciation given to the exhibitions sponsors, the Prime Minister toured the grounds of the SLECC (Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre), meeting various representatives from the 150-plus international participating companies and brands from 17 countries, including Germany, Thailand, Singapore, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, USA, UK, Denmark, Italy, China, India, Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, Turkey, and, of course, Sri Lanka.
The theme of the exhibition, Transformation and Modernisation of Sri Lankas Livestock Industry, was prevalent throughout the corridors of the SLECC. Technological advances, as well as various types of feed and equipment for dairy processing, livestock breeding, and waste management, were on display. Representatives from the respective companies were eager to explain how their respective products would benefit the Sri Lankan agricultural field and rural economy here more generally.
Lanka Livestock 2017 is Sri Lankas first ever international culture, feed, and livestock production exhibition. Taking place at the SLECC from July 20th to July 22nd, the exhibition aims to provide a platform that will provide suppliers of agriculture, feed and livestock production equipment and supplies to meet farmers, plantation owners, feed producers, veterinarians, processors and integrators.
Over 3,000 relevant people including farmers, breeders, feed manufacturers, veterinarians, university academics, students, and dairy and meat processors are expected to attend.

The sport that is like rugby in water
BUDAPEST: Its a brutal battle won by the team who can best master its dark arts.
Water polo is not for the faint-hearted and, below the surface, fierce competitors push its rules to the limit.
Away from the eyes of officials, players will kick and punch each other in pursuit of victory.
We always hold the enemy, Hungarian water polo player dm Decker tells CNN. (We) catch the bathing suit, sometimes punch, (and kick).
Some (say) the most important things happen under the water.
Hungary head coach Tams Mrcz appears to favor rough play, even practicing moves designed to go undetected by the refs.
Water polo is like rugby in the water -- or worse -- because the referees cannot see anything, he admits. Ninety percent of the guys (bodies) are under the water.
We like this kind of playing, he adds. We practice (how to wrestle) under the water. The guys call this kind of practice victory, (as in) only the victory counts.
The goal is not to be violent, but sporting aggression is part of our game.
US mens captain Tony Azevedo, however, thinks violence in the sport has gotten out of hand.
Its definitely the most physical game out there, and the referees dont see whats going on, he told inquirer.net in 2011. Its a brutal game, and in the end its not as finessed as youd like to see.
You want to see some good goals and nice moves and in the end it turns out to be a boxing match.
BLOOD IN THE WATER
Decker will be testing his combative skills alongside his Hungarian teammates, starting Friday at the FINA World Aquatics Championships. Once again, the pressure of an entire nation will rest on the teams shoulders.
Water polo is engraved into Hungarys athletic heritage: The country has won nine of the 26 Olympic water polo events and medaled 15 times, figures that blow its competitors out of the water.
The sport cemented its place as the de facto national pastime following the Blood in the Water match in 1956 -- a clash between the Soviet Union and Hungary, that for many reflected the troubles of the two nations during the devastating period of the Cold War.
The countrys historic success has inspired younger generations to try to become the next Tams Kss, Hungarys most decorated water polo player who led the team to three straight Olympic golds between 2000 and 2008.
When we were children, everybody was dreaming about the gold medal, says Mrcz, the current coach who was also part of that gold medal trilogy as a player. Also the same thing (happens) now: All the children who are coming to the pool would like to become Olympic gold medalists,
Despite Hungarys previous dominance, Mrcz knows competition at the upcoming tournament -- led by favorites Serbia -- will be fierce.
Its very difficult now in international water polo because at this moment there are a lot of very good teams, he says.
Since their first victory in the 1936 Olympics, the heat has beeen on Hungary players like Balzs Erdlyi.
There are a lot of expectations, he says. The media and the people on average expect us to get a gold medal every time, so its big pressure on us.
His teammate Decker, however, says the pressure is an added incentive. When I play in the water and I just look around and see 8,000 people, some people feel pressure, he says, but for me its a motivation and it gives me big energy in the hardest moments.  CNN

SSC bags Premier League title after three years
The Championship that eluded the SSC for a period of three years has been retained once again by SSC. What is unique about this years Championship was it was won by the budding youngsters that represented SSC, whilst most of the senior players were on National duty in South Africa and Australia. This signifies the depth of cricket talent, scouted and nurtured by the SSC, has yielded the fruit of exuberant youth prevailing in the club.
The performance of the players does not reflect very much in the statistics. This is due to the fact that most players were on National duty at given times and the players that replaced the National players were equal to the task. As for the batting as many as 6 centuries and 23 half centuries were scored towards winning the championship. The centuries were scored by Danushka Gunathilake , Dimuth Karunaratne , Minodh Banuka and Sachitra Senanayake [1] and out of the 23 half centuries Charith Asalanka the Under 19 schoolboy cricketer of the year and Under 19 national captain lead the way by scoring 5 half centuries. In terms of the bowling, Sachitra Senanayake leads the way by capturing 43 wickets along with Jeffrey Vandersay behind him with 39 wickets, Vandersay also had a rich hall of five wicket hauls and ended up with two match bags of 10 wickets, whilst Vimukthi Perera chipped in with 25 and Kasun Madushanka 27 wickets, making valuable contributions with the bat when needed to showcase his all-round ability.
Danushka Gunathilake leads the batting averages with an average of 70.0 and a strike rate of 79.24 by scoring 2 centuries and 2 half centuries in as many as 7 innings. K. Kulasekera with 415 runs with 3 half centuries, M. Banuka with 474 runs with a highest score of 146 runs to his name and a half century along with Dasun Shanaka with 4 half centuries too made valuable contributions towards SSC annexing the championship.
To cap it all Sachitra Senanayake was the best player of the team by scoring 380 runs and not only capturing 43 wickets but also responsible for 18 catches which speaks in volumes of his ability to perform under pressure at times using all his international experience to lead SSC to the Championship.
To say the least the diehard Cricket Committee was headed by the dynamic and charismatic Trinity/SSC fast bowler of yesteryear and SL poolist Samantha Dodanwela, a firstclass cricketer of repute and his able Committee that comprises of a yet another group of first class cricketers of no mean repute, Mahinda Halangoda, Michael de Zoysa, Thilina Kandamby, Shamal de Silva, and Cricket Coordinator Naveen Perera.
The Cricket Committee has also gone a step further in obtaining the services of a brilliant all-rounder, during his time, by appointing Gayan Wijekoon as the Head Coach together with another first class cricketer Sudharshan Guruge as its manager, to bring about the required skill acquisition, mental toughness and disciplines that are the hallmark of a champion side.
The SSC Executive Committee spearheaded by Tommy Ellawela, the president has also given the required impetus by obtaining a lucrative sponsorship and also provided the players further, with the required facilities by way of Gym, Indoor facilities, side and center turf training facilities along with a swimming pool to ensure that the players are well looked after and managed in water based training and recoveries.
The additional support staff by way of a fielding coach qualified and well experienced physio and trainer has been along with the team together with Gayan guiding them to the cherished prestigious domestic championship 2016/17.
The younger players that represent SSC from the outstation has been provided with in house dormitory facilities, nourishments and medical facilities to ensure that all players are well managed this is in addition to the players been paid a match fee that has been deposited to the players account on a regular basis.
The present group of SSC youngsters are now challenging the senior players by finding their way into SLC development squads and SLC representative teams. The players that have excelled during the season has once again caught the eye of the National Selectors and a few of them have found their way to play against Bangladesh, ICC Champions Trophy in England and the touring Zimbabwe national team, whilst a few players have taken wing to play competitive league cricket in England. SSC is now planning to take part in the International Club T20 Tournament with the invitation of Singapore Cricket Club, which will be held from 11 to 14 of August. During the last five occasions this tournament was held, SSC won it thrice and also became the inaugural champions.

T20 is evolving so fast it is radically redefining cricket
Twenty20 cricket is easy to deride. This is a format invented by a marketing survey. Its surrounding razzmatazz  everything from pitch-side jacuzzis to cheerleaders to all those nicknames, deliberately ludicrous and yet instantly forgettable  has often seemed designed to make spectators forget that they were actually watching cricket.
Yet take a step back from the surrounding glitz. What you will see is a game that, because of its very youth, is evolving at a rate that might be unmatched throughout all sport. With every year cricketing received wisdom takes another hit: T20 unsentimentally disregards the sports old tropes unless they deliver victories.
You have to be a lot more precise because you have no time to make adjustments. In Test matches you assess by sessions; in one-day cricket you assess by overs; in T20 cricket you assess by balls, explains Phil Simmons, who coached West Indies to victory in last years World Twenty20.
That West Indies team have a fair claim to being T20s greatest ever side. On the field they married unrivalled six-hitting depth with canny bowling that combined spin, pace and chicanery. Less well-known, in defiance of the image of a triumph for raw skill over planning, was the teams reliance on data. Every day during the tournament Simmons talked to Gaurav Sundararaman, the teams consultant analyst, for half an hour or more. He was a very good help in going through the opposition and things that we could try on different grounds, says Simmons. The thing about data is its how you use it. Our players used it very well.
Data informed the West Indies decisions during the tournament. They knew that South Africa struggled against spin, so played an extra spinner and used Chris Gayles off-spin for three overs against their left-handers. Andre Russells poor economy rate at the death led to him bowling earlier in the innings. When batting, Russell was told to anticipate the slower ball, which had dismissed him 15 times in T20 games in 2015; he did so spectacularly during the epic semi-final run chase against India. And they opened with a spinner, Samuel Badree, in every match; spinners are consistently more economical than quicks in the opening overs.
Statistical analysis encouraged West Indies to invert one of crickets great axioms  to always bat first. West Indies won the toss every game, and chased every time: A huge advantage, Simmons reflects. Last year, 72% of teams in T20 cricket decided to bat second; 55% of games were won by the chasing team.
Perhaps most significant was West Indies embrace of boundary-hitting above all else. In their semi-final heist of 193, the West Indies batsmen played out 50 dot balls, 23 more than India - but hit 11 sixes to Indias four. As balls whizzed off Caribbean bats like fireworks set off into the night sky it reflected a batting approach that prioritised strike rate over average.
The West Indies strategy recognised a common refrain of analysts: wickets have been systematically overvalued in T20, holding totals back. The average team loses only 5.8 wickets an innings, and big-hitters are often wasted too low in the order. Realisation of this is pioneering radical new approaches to batting, embodied by Sunil Narine in this years Indian Premier League. Normally a bowler, Narine was promoted to open. He was dismissed once every 10 balls, but for an average of 17.23. If that sounds underwhelming, if replicated by every batsman it would comfortably clear the T20 average score and, indeed, total 16 runs higher than a team batting at Joe Roots strike rate. In these figures lie a fundamental truth: T20 is no adjunct to the longer formats. It is a completely different sport.
While Test cricket has always fetishised numbers, the paradox is that the shorter the format the more useful they are. In Test and even one-day international cricket there are relatively few matches, a paucity of useful individual player data and so many variables from game to game that team analysts believe old data on a player becomes redundant after two years. But T20 is ideally suited to data analysis. There are fewer variables from match-to-match  pitches tend to be similar, and match scenarios far more repetitive  and leading players can play 50 T20s a year, providing a proper sample size for data-mining. And, unlike in international cricket, teams in T20 leagues need to be able to quantify a players precise worth when assembling their squads.
The use of data is being accelerated by more outside voices, unshackled by crickets rigid orthodoxies. They want to keep track of everything in pursuit of a competitive advantage, recognising how far behind baseball T20 remains in its use of numbers. In the coming years that will change. Finally, the sport is gaining proper data on fielding  the runs fielders save, or cost, and the wickets they effect, or squander  which is increasingly influencing team selection. It is also impacting fielding positions; Richard Barker, the analyst for Englands 2016 T20 Blast champions Northamptonshire, foresees that the long stop will return to being a legitimate fielding position, because of modern batsmens propensity for ramps and scoops. Data could also salvage one of crickets most cherished lost species: the specialist wicketkeeper. Lower-order batsmen face so few balls  the average No7 faces seven balls an innings  that Barker believes picking the best keeper could be prudent.
Some metrics borrowed from baseball will become common, like wins above replacement, measuring a players added value compared to an average cricketer in the same position. Barker, a devotee of analytics in American sports, also predicts that boundary slogging percentage  how many balls a batsman needs to hit a four or six  and a variant of baseballs late-inning pressure situation, rating players on how they perform in clutch situations, could soon become common parlance.
Teams are becoming more assiduous in sizing up the ground dimensions and match-ups in a game and adjusting their team selection accordingly  for instance, picking a bowler specifically to target a star opposition batsmans vulnerability, notes AR Srikanth, Kolkata Knight Riders team analyst. Before Northants quarter-final victory over Middlesex last year, Barker compiled a 25-page dossier dissecting all facets of the opposition for the captain and coaches. The ceaseless quest for competitive advantage will take cricket into new terrain. Batsmen playing themselves in is an unaffordable indulgence when four balls equates to more than 3% of the teams innings. Trent Woodhill, one of the growing breed of specialist T20 coaches at the vanguard of crickets new-age thinking, believes that batting cages will soon prepare the next man in. Its only superstition dressed up as tradition thats stopping it, he says, encapsulating the T20 revolutionaries contempt for crickets conventional thinking. A lot of what players do on game day is based on praying to the cricket gods or what theyve always done rather than actually getting ready for that first ball.
Men like Woodhill are driving forward change at an almost unfathomable rate. One of the next frontiers will be batsmen using virtual reality headsets. These can neurally prime batsmens brains before they face their first ball, explains Cathy Craig, who has been developing VR sets for cricket. The ECB is visiting a demonstration of her equipment in August.
Another new battleground will be teams encouraging playing to use wearable technology to track their precise movements - like pace and agility in the field, how quickly they turn while batting and how much they tire. Ultimately this may culminate in a debate, like in basketball, about how much wearable technology teams can mandate their players to wear.
In T20s early years, the shortest formats wider impact on crickets ecosystem sometimes seemed more interesting than the game itself. T20 today, a world of ceaseless innovation and conventions being inverted at a dizzying pace, does not need any embellishment.

Travel goods to U.S. EXEMPTED FROM DUTY
Travel goods from Sri Lanka will enjoy duty-free entry to the United States, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said yesterday.
In a statement, the Ministry said bags, wallets and backpacks will enjoy duty free status after previously coming under a tariff of 6 to 20 percent. The statement followed a decision by the United States to approve the inclusion of travel goods from all GSP beneficiary countries among which Sri Lanka is one.
According to the ministry the consequences of the decision by the United States are far-reaching, with positive effects on the Sri Lankan economy a likelihood.
Following this concession, Sri Lankas travel goods exports to the United States will have the potential to regain the market share previously enjoyed by Sri Lanka by making the country among top 10 suppliers to the US market, once again, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in its statement.
The United States decision would benefit the Sri Lankan economy in other ways, the ministry said. This development would bolster the local manufacturing industry and investments in this industry. It would also lead to the creation of new jobs in the travel goods manufacturing sector in Sri Lanka.

Vaas takes over as bowling coach
Bangladesh CB interested in Ramanayake:
Chaminda Vaas will replace Champaka Ramanayake as Sri Lanka's bowling coach. Ramanayake, who resigned after the series against Zimbabwe, cited personal reasons for ending a two-year stint following his reappointment in 2015.
SLC made Vaas appointment official on Friday, saying the former fast bowler will guide the pace attack for the India tour of Sri Lanka. Since August 2016, Vaas has been working with Sri Lanka's feeder squads into the national team.
Ramanayake has said he is considering several options for his next assignment. ESPNcricinfo has learned that the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) is firm in its interest to bring him back under its wing. It is not clear what role he is being offered but there's a strong suggestion, especially with Courtney Walsh's appointment as Bangladesh's bowling coach, that Ramanayake will be assigned to the BCB's high performance unit.
Ramanayake was the first bowling coach appointed by the BCB in March 2008 after heading Sri Lanka's fast-bowling academy for seven years.
He is highly regarded among the current lot of Bangladesh fast bowlers, particularly for guiding many of them in their youth during his stint. He has often been credited with the rise of Rubel Hossain and Shafiul Islam.
For Vaas, the role is only temporary for now, but he has done the job in the past, having been the national team's bowling coach between February 2013, and April 2015. He has also had coaching positions with New Zealand and Ireland in brief stints.
