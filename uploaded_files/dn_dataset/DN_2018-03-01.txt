Construction sector, a major contributor to our economy
The construction sector is making a major contribution towards the country's economic progress. According to statistics, the construction sector has achieved the second position in the industrial sector in the third quarter of 2017, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
The construction sector has been making vast strides in projects such as the Colombo International Financial City, Southern Expressway extension, Colombo outer circle highway and Colombo metropolis and suburban housing projects.
The Minister was addressing the gathering at the CIDA Awards 2017 ceremony, held at the BMICH, under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena recently.
The Minister who said that they hoped to streamline strategies and the legal framework relating to the construction sector through five gazette notifications, added that the national construction policy approved on the initiative of the President and the Prime Minister, had fulfilled a dire need for the progress of the construction sector.
The demand for construction technicians outnumbered the supply available. The dearth of trained and talented technicians and professionals was a great drawback in the development of the construction industry. Many firms in the construction industry clamoured for permission to bring technicians from abroad to fill the gap. However, the government could not approve that request as a matter of policy, Minister Premadasa said.
When the yahapalana government assumed office, the Construction Industry Development Authority (CIDA) launched a programme titled Shilpa Saviya under which nearly 12,000 masons, carpenters, electricians, plumbers and iron benders have been trained. Minister Premadasa said the import of foreign labour was not a proper solution to the shortage of construction technicians. The government and the private sector should make a joint effort to resolve this problem locally. He therefore requested the private sector to provide worksites for training of technicians under the Shilpa Saviya programme and also provide them with additional allowances.

Government has forgotten problems of the people
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Leader and Member of Parliament Anura Kumara Dissanayake said yesterday the government has forgotten the problems of the people as a result of the power struggle between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Addressing a media briefing held at the partys headquarters in Pelawatte, Battaramulla, he said the government has a responsibility and a duty towards the countrys people. However, after the local government polls, both President and Prime Minister have forgotten the problems faced by ordinary people and are fighting to consolidate their respective power bases. Now, there is anarchy in the country. The economy is really chaotic, he said.
Foreign direct investment is not coming in as the rupee has depreciated. There are over 50,000 undergraduates without jobs. Consumers are helpless due to skyrocketing prices of essential food, but the rulers of the country are constantly working to consolidate their power without providing solutions to the problems faced by the people, Dissanayake said. Even though the people have taught a good lesson to the government at the recent election, rulers are still not thinking about the problems faced by the people.
Although the paddy harvesting season has begun, there is still no proper mechanism to purchase paddy from the farmers. Both the President and the Prime Minister are attacking each other by forgetting the problems of the people.
Although the government promised to do an effective Cabinet reshuffle for the benefit of the people and the country, this is an attempt to please each other.
If the rulers further forget to provide solutions to the peoples problems, we will launch massive public agitation campaign in the near future, he said.
He further said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has been accused of shielding corrupted individuals.
We will not extend our support for Ranil Wickremesinghe to continue in the Prime Ministers
post any longer. We will also not join hands with any party in Parliament, but will remain independent, he said.

Ananda College who began the schools season strongly but have failed to maintain that momentum will be hoping that they can get their act together for the Big one against traditional rivals Nalanda College when they meet in the 89th Battle of the Maroons cricket encounter for the Dr NM Perera memorial trophy on March 3 and 4 at the SSC grounds.
All-rounder and 4th year coloursman Asela Sigera has guided his school to three outright wins in 13 outings against Zahira Colombo, Dharmapala Pannipitiya and Lumbini in their Under 19 Inter School cricket tournament this season. They have suffered a loss to St. Joseph's College. Ananda have also recorded five first innings victories and lost two on the first innings.
Skipper Sigera has scored 450 runs and performed with the ball as well claiming 52 wickets. The leading run getter of the team is deputy skipper and 4th year coloursman Lahiru Attanayake with over 700 runs under his belt inclusive of a century and seven half centuries. His best was 108 not out against Trinity College.
All rounder and 2nd year coloursman (right hand bat and medium pacer) Dushan Hettige is one of the key performers of the team with 620 runs inclusive of three hundreds and three half centuries with a highest score of 114 against Trinity College.
All rounder Daminda Reshan is another player to watch having scored over 300 runs including a century against Maliyadeva and bagging 34 wickets. Another key role player is right hand batsman and pacer Shamal Hirushan with 411 runs and 30 wickets.
Other top order batsmen who are expected to contribute are Kanishka Ranthilakage (500 runs) and Kavindu Gimhana (300).
In the Battle of the Maroons history Ananda leads the tally with 12 wins against Nalandas six with 71 drawn. The last victory in a Maroons Battle was recorded by Ananda at the Big Match in 2003 under Duminda Kularatne.
Ananda College has produced many talented players to the national team such as Anuruddha Polonowita, Sunil Wettimuny, Sidath Wettimuny, Ajith de Silva, Brendon Kuruppu, Arjuna Ranatunga, Marvan Atapattu, Sanjeewa Ranatunga, Thilan Samaraweera, Tilan Wijesinghe, Hemantha Wickramaratne, Chandika Hathurusingha, Avishka Gunawardena, Thilina Kandamby, Akalanka Ganegama, Muthumudalige Pushpakumara, Nishantha Ranatunga, Mahela Udawatta, Mithra Wettimuny, Dhammika Ranatunga, Charith Senanayake, Dulip Samaraweera and the current Sri Lanka Test cricket captain Dinesh Chandimal.
The first half century, the first century and also the first double century for Sri Lanka in Test Cricket were scored by three Anandians  Arjuna Ranatunga, Sidath Wettimuny and Brendon Kuruppu respectively. Kuruppu incidentally is the only wicket-keeper in the history of Test cricket to score a double century on debut.
The Anandians are coached by Ramesh Perera with Amal Fernando as his assistant.

Former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran will be arrested for sure, said Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine Rajitha Senaratne, adding that people ask questions Mahendrans arrest, but nobody talks about the initiatives taken to arrest Udayanga Weeratunga. Addressing the Cabinet press conference yesterday at the Government Information Department, the Minister said that even the media reported on the bond scam continuously and not about the corruption that took place under the former government.
Corruption is corruption, no matter who does it, he said.
A red notice has been issued to arrest Weeratunga. That is not an easy task. We have to go through several procedures to issue it. Similarly, Arjuna Mahendran will also be arrested. Minister Senaratne said that the police cannot arrest him when the investigation is going on and added that now the court has given the order to arrest.

Big match season heats up Platinum,  Gold and Silver title chase
The 2018 inter-school big match season got off to an interesting start with the first of the four key traditional games in Colombo. Apart from the Thurstan-Isipatana encounter, there were a couple of other big matches, including the inaugural Battle of Friends annual limited over encounter between Christ King College Tudella and Loyola College Negombo at Saravanamuttu Stadium.
Isipatana held Thurstan to an exciting draw in their 55th annual cricket encounter played at SSC grounds last weekend. Chasing a victory target of 254 runs from a maximum of 57 overs, Isipatana were tottering at 153 for seven wickets when the play was called off after 52 overs due to bad light.
The three other main big matches in Colombo  the Battle of the Golds, Battle of the Maroons and the Battle of the Saints will be played during the month of March, generally known as the big match month.
With the oldest uninterrupted inter-school cricket encounter in the world  the Royal-Thomian known for its high traditions for 14 decades, due to begin its latest edition next Thursday, school cricket will be at its best, generating tremendous interest and excitement.
While the big match fever hits the main cities around the country, the race for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year will reach its climax. Voting for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest, conducted under three divisions - Platinum, Gold and Silver, is gradually reaching its peak as schoolboys and their supporters show a special interest towards their respective school teams during the Big Match season.
Becoming the Obsever-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year will be the ultimate dream of every schoolboy cricketer as they are acutely aware that such high recognition would take them closer to securing a place in Sri Lanka national team in the coming years. That common belief is justified as there have been enough and more examples from the day the first-ever Observer Schoolboy Cricketer Ranjan Madugalle was selected to play for Sri Lanka at the Prudential World Cup tournament in England in 1979.
Merely a couple of months after becoming the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in the inaugural year (1979), the then Royal captain found a place in the Sri Lanka team for the second ICC World Cup tournament. Just out of school after leading the Reid Avenue boys at the centenary Royal-Thomian cricket encounter, Madugalle made his Sri Lanka debut against India in Manchester exactly on his 20th birthday.
It turned out to be a perfect birthday celebration for Madugalle as his team, then Sri Lanka only an associate member of the ICC without Test status, beat much fancied India by 47 runs in their first round match of the 1979 World Cup tournament.
Three years later, Madugalle and the very next winner of the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title Arjuna Ranatunga (in 1980 and 1982) were selected to play for Sri Lanka in its inaugural Test  against England way back in February, 1982. Both of them grabbed the memorable opportunity they got to score half centuries. Ranatunga (54) became the first ever Sri
Lanka batsman to score a half century in Test cricket. Minutes later, Madugalle (65) completed his half century in Sri Lankas first innings.
For many past Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year winners, the mega title they had won at Sri Lankas oldest school cricket awards show remains the most memorable moment in their lives. Despite going places and winning many International Awards, they still value the cherished moment at the mega event.
One such legendary Sri Lanka cricketer is former national captain turned Cabinet Minister Arjuna Ranatunga. You may go places and win many other international awards, but an award won at Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year event remains the most memorable in every cricketers life, said
Ranatunga in a recent interview. Winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Award twice remains the most cherished moment in my life Ranatunga was quoted as saying. He further added that those titles won from 1980 to 1982 had given him tremendous inspiration and confidence when he had stepped into the international arena.
When a schoolboy is adjudged the Best Batsman, Best Bowler, Best All-rounder or the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year, thats a tremendous boost for a youngster, who could then aim at club level and international level thereafter, he added.
Former Nalanda captain and member of Sri Lankas World Champion team in 1986, Kumar Dharmasena, the winner of the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award in 1989, had said that it was one of the greatest moments in his career as a cricketer.
Winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title was a big inspiration.
That helped and encouraged me to play for Sri Lanka. Winning such a mega award gives a huge image and confidence to a schoolboy cricketer to go places. We were determined to reach the top of the ladder and did so with dedication, said the ICC Elite panel umpire who had now competed 50 Tests as an ICC umpire.
Sri Lankas first and the most prestigious school cricket award show will be celebrating its 40th milestone this year, continuing the rich traditions maintained by the countrys flagship English newspaper, the Sunday Observer. With SLT Mobitel stepping in as the principal sponsor 11 years ago, the contest has gone from strength to strength. It all began way back in 1979 at a time when there had not been a single School Cricket Awards show. Forget about an awards show altogether, but there had not been an organized inter-school first XI tournament at that time. Schools engaged in first XI cricket had only their friendly and traditional inter-school matches.
Beside Madugalle, who subsequently went on to captain Sri Lanka and now serves as the Chief Match Referee of the ICC, the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest has produced some of the top Sri Lanka cricketers who had prominently marked the country in the world cricketing map.
That ever-growing list of galaxy of stars includes Sri Lankas World Cup-winning captain Ranatunga and the worlds highest wicket taker in Test cricket Muttiah Muralitharan.
Ranatunga, who captained Sri Lanka to the World Cup triumph way back in 1996, was adjudged Observer Schoolboy Cricketer in 1980 as an emerging star from Ananda College, Colombo.
He had that rare honor of winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer Award twice (in 1980 and 1982), a feat achieved by only a handful of schoolboy cricketers, including former Sri Lanka captain and ICC Match Referee Roshan Mahanama. Spin wizard Muralitharan first came to limelight as a schoolboy cricketer from St. Anthonys College, Katugastota by capturing over 100 wickets each in successive seasons. He was adjudged the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer in 1989.
Apart from Madugalle, Ranatunga, Mahanama, Muralitharan and Dharmasena, several star cricketers have won this coveted award. Among them are Sri Lankas world cup stars Asanka Gurusinha and Marvan Atapattu to name a few.
As a brilliant schoolboy cricketer from St. Servatious College, Matara, Sanath Jayasuriya too had won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Outstation title in 1988.
That alone speaks the high traditions maintained by the Mega Show which continues to produce champion cricketers.
At a time when there had not been a single awards show for schoolboy cricketers or an organized inter-school Under-19 two-day tournament, the Sunday Observer and its publisher Lake House understood the need to inspire the countrys budding cricketers. That had given birth to the countrys biggest School Cricket Awards show.
It is heartening to see that several others have followed the Sunday Observers initiative to hold similar awards shows to commend the achievements of schoolboy cricketers after every season. But the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year remains as the Mother of all Shows.

Citizens' Mail
Common sense, not so common!
In our blessed island of Sri Lanka, non-adherence to road rules causing traffic congestions and accidents have always made it to the headlines of the news bulletins of print, radio and TV. During the past year, the government has taken a few measures with the objective of curtailing the traffic congestion especially along the streets of the Megapolis. One such measure is the implementation of the Bus Lanes and new Bus Stops.
The other day, I was walking along Maradana Road, when I noticed that a new bus stop has been put up at a stones throw away from a leading school in Colombo. This particular bus stop does save students of this school the hassle of crossing the streets in which the motorists show no concern towards the pedestrians. Well, that seems to be a great idea, isnt it However, this morning the bus stop had become a car stop for a few hours when a car parked itself exactly on the area demarcated for buses to stop and board pedestrians. Surprised by this act, I walked towards the car to check if the driver was still in the car and it turned out to be that he was. This car did not budge a bit for a few hours until I left the place.
By the way, this bus stop is right opposite a Police Station which is also in close proximity to the school.
This might seem to be ridiculous, but let us also consider the impact that acts of this nature have on hapless pedestrians and passengers. On that note, I shall list out two major weaknesses which I can derive from this incident.
1. The process of issuing the driving licence
When it comes down to issuing the driving licence, the rules and regulations seem to be very strict on paper. But what happens in reality is the complete opposite. Certain training centres have their own agents to ensure that the drivers who train under them are not compelled to undergo the stringent process of testing which certifies the capability of the driver. I have known certain individuals who bribed the officials just before the written test which merely consists of questions such as identifying road signals. Therefore, RMV should ensure that every Dick, Tom and Harry are not issued licences but only given to those who actually pass their driving test.
2. The traffic police
Those of you reading this might recall how many a police officer have requested for santhosams when drivers/riders are caught for traffic offences. While we, the students, are being taught that policemen are responsible for maintaining law and order and safeguarding the people, the manner in which they act in reality is obviously ironical.
Dear motorists (who offend rules as a practice), it is highly recommended that you use something known as common sense which will undoubtedly be highly effective in curtailing road accidents. As for the driver who parked his car at a bus stop, do keep in mind that a bus has 6 wheels while a car has 4 and that stop is in fact allocated only for the vehicle with 6 wheels!

Dickwella axed for Hero Nidahas trophy tri-series
First choice wicket-keeper for quite some time Niroshan Dickwella has been dropped from the Sri Lankan squad of 15 named for the three-nation T20 international Hero Nidahas trophy from March 6-18 at the R Premadasa Stadium.
Dickwella has not been in the best of form in recent ODI and T20I matches and his wicket-keeping duties will in all probability be filled by Kusal Perera who has returned to the side after an injury.
Dickwella has made only one half century in his last 17 ODI innings since scoring back to back hundreds against Zimbabwe at Hambantota last July and, in T20Is, he scored only 39 runs in three innings in India last December and made 11 in the first T20I against Bangladesh recently before being dropped for the second game.
Test captain Dinesh Chandimal who led Sri Lanka to victory over Bangladesh in the tri-series and T20 internationals in the absence of injured white ball captain Angelo Mathews, has been handed the task of leading his country once again in the T20 format.
Fast bowler Suranga Lakmal has been named Chandimals deputy
Other notable changes in the squad are the return of fast bowlers Nuwan Pradeep and Dushmantha Chameera and the inclusion of batsman Dhananjaya de Silva, whose last T20I appearance was against South Africa in January last year. These three players replace Dickwella, Jeffrey Vandersay and Shehan Madushanka (injured) from the Sri Lanka squad that won the T20I series 2-0 in Bangladesh.
The Hero Nidahas trophy tri-series commences on March 6 with Sri Lanka meeting India. Bangladesh are the third team taking part.
SRI LANKA SQUAD OF 15: Dinesh Chandimal (Captain), Upul Tharanga, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Dasun Shanaka, Kusal Perera, Thisara Perera, Jeewan Mendis, Suranga Lakmal (Vice Captain), Isuru Udana, Akila Dananjaya, Amila Aponso, Nuwan Pradeep, Dushmantha Chameera, Dhananjaya de Silva.

Glory of renunciation
King Suddhodana had not been blessed with the opportunity of hearing theDhamma, even though a majority in Jambudweepa had enjoyed the doctrine of the Buddha. He had not seen his son for six years since the renunciation and when he heard that Sakyamuni was at Weluwanarama on his Sasanic tour, the impatient Kingdispatched a minister accompanied by a retinue of several thousand followers to invite him toKimbulwathpura. Nine ministers were sent at different times.
The present day Nepal which adds to the prestige of one time Jambudweepa within the Buddhist world was none other than the Kingdom of Kapilavasthu also known as Kimbulwathpura, was ruled by King Suddhodana of the Sakya dynasty. Nestled in a tranquil location these royal cities were hailed as the most venerated cities occupying a unique place in religious history. What was this due to It was mainly due to the fact Bosath Siddhartha the future Thathagatha in his last life, born to the worthy Sakyan couple, renounced all his luxury and attained Buddhahood for the relief of the humanity. He emphasized that by truly and sincerely following the light of the Dhamma (his teachings), they could lead noble lives, develop their minds, practise loving kindness (Metta) and bring about peace and harmony.
Worried king
King Suddhodana had not been blessed with the opportunity of hearing the Dhamma, even though a majority in Jambudweepa had enjoyed the doctrine of the Buddha. He had not seen his son for six years since the renunciation and when he heard that Sakyamuni was at Weluwanarama on his Sasanic tour, the impatient King dispatched a minister accompanied by a retinue of several thousand followers to invite him to Kimbulwathpura. Nine ministers were sent at different times.
The anxious King was disappointed as no one returned. They had all been attracted by the Supreme Dhamma of the great Master andhad all become true Arahants now. The King in dismay quite determined turned to Minister Kaaludai  Prince Siddharthas playmate, born on the same day and requested him to invite his son on his behalf to come to the city.
He accepted it instantly, but on condition that he be given permission to enter the order.
Hence he was sent with yet another thousand followers who listened to theDhamma and became his disciples. After a week describing the panaromic view of the way side in 60 stanzas the Buddha was informed of the honoured invitation of his father. He said Oh Lord of heroes, the time has come for you to visit the Sakyans coming down from the Bhageeratha generation for their emancipation.
Gnathi Sanghahanang
Saadhu Udai Karissami Gnathi Sanghahanan well I did accept invitation - expressed the Buddha and set out from Weluwanarama to Kimbulwath on Medin Full moon day.
A distance of 60 yojanas is said to have covered by the Buddha paving the way for the wayside devotees to gather merit and attain Nibbana. Sakyamini was able to put through a large number. But on arrival Sakyans did not worship him, due to pure ignorance which could be termed as false pride considering him junior to them. This compelled him to use his unique psychic powers  Yamaka Prathihara  the Twin Miracle by which he could emanate at will fire from one half of the body and water from the other half.
Moved by the amazing performance, the King worshipped Sakyamuni at once followed by the proud Sakyans, reminiscing the two previous occasions that the King worshipped him.
Sandakinduru Jatakaya
Amidst the Sakyan crowd, the absence of Queen Yasodhara, the wife of Prince Siddhartha, was a prominent factor, which made the Buddha to go to her knowing that she was a faithful and sincere character throughout samsara. Recollecting the strong bond they had in their previous lives, he delivered the sermon of Sandakinduru Jataka reflecting the true love and devotion of a faithful wife.
The weeping Yasodhara who was at his feet holding them was praised for her exemplary behaviour, finally attaining Sotapanna. Her next interest was to enter the order for which he gave no reply as it was not the correct time. Prince Rahula and Nanda were ordained while the others venerated the Buddha who blessed them with overwhelming compassion.

Grand  conclusions and islanders skills
What a fabulous and gruelling season this league has been ...right from the word go ...decent match scripts crafted by seasoned experts carefully concealed in their tested armchairs  And performance levels that showed a degree of meticulous preparation.
There was little doubt or hesitation about the inform quality or ability to change gears as required....or to motor up the park, win the turnover and plenty for that bank of expert finishers to seal the deal.
Kandy quite pleasingly averaged 30+ per game and 40+ if at home inside the Nittawela cauldron. Their fanatical fans enjoying the form whatever the weather or special magic the visiting opposition, threw at them. The inevitability of the big W growing stronger with each game they played and gelled as a team.
What a grand season for skipper Gayan, grabbing the double and good news at home too ...his personal performance level marching up together with his team's ...and closing the challenge without breaking a sweat ...half time scores mighty misleading...
except for CH&FC and Havelocks pushing them down to the wire ...Life was pleasing ...with nothing missing, both sides of the pitch.
The achievement a telling testament to the lions passion for the code and discipline to keep wracking ....up the big {W's}...with solid tactics to finish as they had planned ...fundamentally, a degree of patience that clearly set them apart from all clubs in Sri.
Both league and Clifford Cup the glittering Dialog/Sri Lanka rugby partnership shining bright into the Colombo skyline...with the game stepping up past all issues that sounded a few alarms
The TMO and referee button, always good to wire up our soapbox brigade and pundits with lots to chew. All part of the game and much glamour to boot ...with our warriors on film.
Much will waxed about how we get this game to the next level...and can our islanders league step up to match the pro Japanese or Hong Kong league structure anytime soon
Will expatriates be allowed back to boost gates and balloon the season at the highest altitude of quality
Will there be separate investment for clubs to handle the facility and player upgrades next season
Will there be more floodlit games next season....which really make it a telling experience for players and fans
Will the other clubs install floodlights and TV facilities
Will there be giant screen replays at all matches in division 1 2018/19
A few relevant thoughts that need careful scrutiny and a good kick upstairs to add to our islanders league....progress must be the beacon to guide our rugby thru troubled waters and calm winds to see us home.
The school season looms with mega anticipation and a lot more besides...it's billed to be the most competitive ever and old boy association season, bigger than ever!
The phenomenon of school rugby is beyond conventional contemplation...it's really a magical mystery tour of our rugby rich stables ...parents, teachers, school old boys and coaching staff to complete the holy alliance.
The endurance of craft and strategy, the most vital components for a successful campaign in division 1 ...player and injury management sharing the same priority for the duration, on the same platform.
Much is being said about teams with traditional strength ...but expect everything...an all or nothing theory each game this season...starting March 2.
I am impressed with the rest of our rugby family about the quality and set up for all the top division teams ...even more telling is the fans and following...serious numbers to support and inspire performance every subsequent week ...irrespective it is a massive adrenaline charged fixture list and food to everyone there...family and school kids to see their colours stand up under pressure...
Let's wish all the stables islandwide for the best competition ever. It's all about skills, heart, fitness and mind that separate the better team in the middle. Preparation is key and arming these young warriors with principles and respect is vital ...the essence of clean hard natural is key to everyone being a winner.
I understand it is a difficult concept to grasp ...but I rather think it a vital intravenous shot of pure rugby values be inculcated and drilled into all school players from U12 up ...that way we breed a generation of true pure rugby knights, who live the code and the values that stand us islanders apart from day 1.
The stage is set ...the international 7s season bids our national squad a warm welcome to the Hong Kong 7s...my mind racing with intimidating impact and heaps of colours that made the trip absolutely unforgettable...9 player visits and the mind still warmed up for more!
Blessings to our 7s team and hopes for inspiration after the club season, let's get our 7s muscles twitching as required, the mind performance ready and the body armed for the tour.
Bula bula Sri islanders...big hearts, bigger minds!

President directs heads of state banks:
Hundred loan schemes for SMEs
President Maithripala Sirisena has given instructions to the Finance Ministry, the Central Bank and to heads of state banks to implement a comprehensive programme of 100 types of joint loan schemes, within the next few months.
This is to provide assistance for local small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and businessmen to uplift their businesses. The President gave these instructions during a meeting held with the heads of state banks at the Presidential Secretariat, yesterday.
The objective of this programme is to encourage local small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and businessmen to induce a new revival in the field of local industry.
The President also instructed the Finance Ministry to provide a report to him within the next two weeks regarding this task, which is to be implemented within the next few months.
The President stressed the importance of paying attention to the proportion of the profits earned by state banks flows to the public. President Sirisena further said that it is very important in the economic processes of the country the relevant benefits flow towards the general public as well as to the entrepreneurs.
The President also highlighted the need for a broader publicity campaign to educate the public on these loan schemes and the President pointed out that one of the main issues that many entrepreneurs face are the issues related to the terms and conditions and documents required of guarantors when obtaining loans. He also stressed the importance of creating an environment to grant loan for entrepreneurs without any inconvenience.
President Sirisena advised the bank chiefs to implement special programmes targeting unemployed graduates to develop them as entrepreneurs. He said that while providing these benefits to people, it should be done without any political intervention and advised the officials to take assistance from the village officers while implementing these programmes.
State banks should be public friendly and courteous with the people who look forward to obtain loans and services, the President said and advised the chairpersons of state banks to instruct the office bearers to provide a healthy service to the public.
President Sirisena pondered on the fact that since Sri Lankan banks were victims of commercialisation and it has adversely affected identifying social problems and giving loans for the development of the country in a positive manner.
He inquired about the loan schemes which are currently dusbursed for local small scale and medium scale entrepreneurs by the Central Bank, the Peoples Bank, State Mortgage and Investment Bank, including state banks under the Finance Ministry and stressed the importance of considering the proposals made by entrepreneurs in implementing such loan schemes.

Inside story of  Maligakande Vidyodaya Pirivena
Dr Mahinda Relapawas latest legal publication titled as Maligakande Vidyodaya Pirivena Viharaye Nadu Theendu (Judgements of Maligakande Vidyodaya Piriven Viharaya) was launched at the Vidyodaya Piriven Hall (Hikkaduwa Sri Sumangala Mawatha, Maradana, Colombo 10) recently. Most Venerable Niyangoda Vijithasiri Mahanayaka Thera chaired the occasion. Chief Justice Priyasath Depp was the Chief Guest. The first copy of the book was presented to Venerable Balangoda Sobhitha Thera. Dr Wickrama Weerasuriya delivered the keynote address. Among the special guests were Venerable Ittepane Dhammalankara Mahanayaka Thera, Venerable Anamaduwe Dhammadassi Mahanayaka Thera, Venerable Vendaruwe Upali Mahanayaka Thera and Venerable Pallegama Sirinivasa Anunayaka Thera. The Supreme Court Judges Eva Wanasundera, Buwaneka Aluvihare, K T Chithrasiri, Priyantha Jayawardene, Prasanna Jayawardana, Vijith Malalgoda, L T B Dehideniya and Nalin Perera also graced the occasion.
The Vidyodya Pirivena was founded due to the efforts of Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera, who is considered to be one of the pioneers in the revival of Buddhism and the tradition of oriental education during the 19th Century in Sri Lanka.
The land at Maligakanda (a suburb of Colombo) and funds for its foundation were donated by the philanthropist Andiris Perera Dharmagunawardhana. Both Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera and Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera, following their success in the Panadura Debate, played key roles in its development.
Their aim was to train educated orator monks to save Buddhism from the decline it was undergoing due to colonial rule, and for that purpose it was made the study of logic compulsory in pirivena education.
The Pirivena taught Buddhist studies as well as pseudo-sciences such as astrology, which were widely accepted and held in high esteem in traditional society.

Kandy SCs  memorable season
Today rugby is very popular in the central hills with the success Kandy Sports Club had this season sweeping everything before them to win the league and knockout titles without losing a single match.
It was a joyful occasion for Kandy who carried away another trophy displaying and outplaying their opponents showcasing their lofty standards. They made history by becoming the first team to win the Clifford Cup on 22 occasions since 1992.
They continued to walk the local rugby world like a colossus this season both in the league and the knockouts.
Kandy SC has won the Clifford Cup for a consecutive period of ten years between 1995 and 2005 (the competition was not held in 1998) and six consecutive years between 2007 and 2012. In 2006 Kandy withdrew from the tournament (due to dispute over the ground allocation).
The years they have won are 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, In the years 1954,1955, 1969 and 1978 they were placed second.
In Sundays Cup final they beat a fighting Sri Lanka Navy XV at Longden Place. Among those who graced this memorable event and enjoyed the top class rugby dished out by Kandy were Dialogs Group Chief Marketing officer Amali Nanayakkara, Sri Lanka Rugby president Asanga Seneviratne and Vice President Lasitha Gunaratne.
The rugby on show was befitting a cup final; where both teams were locked in a tense battle in the first half using all their rugby skills.
The game began with Navy forwards dominating the proceedings. But whenever Kandy won possession they looked very dangerous with their three-quarters running the ball in splendid fashion. Still the sailors prevented Kandys penetrative moves with some terrific tackles by their forwards.
Both teams displayed a willingness to throw the ball around but neither got too close to their opponents line in the first quarter.
The winners displayed some excellent running rugby to show theyll again be hard to stop in the race for the grand win. Everyone was impressed by the work rate of the winning team, the power of the players looked good and their work rate. It was a team effort that resulted in victory.
Many seem to have forgotten those glorious moments of Kandy, but there are still a few who remember the part played by promoters, one such person is former Royalist Malik Mr. Rugby Samarawickrema. Maliks name is a household in the game of rugby.
He played for Royal College as a scrum half from 1966 to 1968 and CR & FC, Low Country and was also a member of the Sri Lanka Presidents XV.
He hung up his boots in 1977 and became a great promoter of the sport, and today in the field of rugby he is the undisputed king maker. It was Samarawickrema who brought Kandy to its present standard through his knowledge and experience.
A big hand should go to the rugby committee headed by former captain Lasantha Wijesuriya. The champion Kandy SC squad comprised Gayan Weeraratne (captain), Damith Dissanayake, Richard Dharmapala, Shehan Pathirana, Oshan Perera, Buwenaka Udangamuwa, Dimitri Wijetunga, Thilina Wijesinghe, Jason Dissanayake, Nigel Ratwatte, Lavanga Perera, Fazil Marija, Lasitha Aththanagoda, Danush Dayan, Dhanushka Ranjan, Asitha Ratnayake, Roshan Weeraratne, Yakoob Ali, Arshad Jamaldeen, Piyumal Manchanayake, Anurudda Wilwara, Ganuka Dissanayake, Uchitha Jayasuriya, Shashika Jayawardana, Heshan Kalhara, Srinath Sooriyabandara, Suhiru Anthony, Ashan Darling, Tharindu Chathuranga, Sanushka Abeywickrama, Heshan Jansen, Diluksha Dange, Kasun Srinath, Chathura Seneviratne, Lakshitha Ranaweera. Coaching staff - Sean Wijesinghe, Saliya Kumara, team manager - Kapila Silva, Sanjeewa Perera and masseur and Siva Kumar.
This was the last game of Fazil Marija, who once again was the cynosure of all eyes and he signed off with another magnificent display.
A player of international class Marija who mesmerized opponents and spectators with his magnificent and inspirational play is not likely to be seen again.

Moral discipline as seen in Buddhism
Moral discipline in Buddhism is not a rocket-science invention of an exceptional mind, but a rational and a practical code based on verifiable facts. That is whyProf. Max Muller of the Oxford University said that Buddhist moral code is the most perfect which the world has ever known.
All Buddhists are well aware of the four Noble Truths as preached by Buddha: that the life is full of suffering (Duhkha), that there is a cause of this suffering (Duhkha-samudaya), it is possible to stop suffering (Duhkha-nirodha), and there is a way to extinguish suffering (Duhkha-nirodha-marga).
Buddha also advocated Noble Eightfold Path (aryaastangika-marga) as a way to extinguishing the sufferings: right understanding, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.
Mid-twentieth century saw the collaborations between many renowned western psychoanalysts and Buddhist scholars on Buddhism and western psychology. They found out that Buddhism and Western Psychology overlap in theory and in practice.
Over the last 60 years, experts have analysed many commonalities between Buddhism and various branches of modern western psychology like phenomenological psychology, psychoanalytical psychotherapy, humanistic psychology and cognitive psychology.
Buddha was a unique psychotherapist. His therapeutic methods helped millions of people throughout the centuries. The Buddhist perspective of moral discipline is a vast subject spread throughout the teachings of the Buddha. Currently many people seem to be very much alive to the subject of Buddhist moral discipline (sila), perhaps because moral discipline is fast slipping away from the thinking and behaviour of too many human beings.
What is moral discipline
Before investigating the Buddhist view of moral discipline, it is necessary to see what is meant by the term moral discipline in general. This word indicates the distinction between right and wrong or good and evil in relation to actions, volitions and character. A moral sense is said to mean the power to understand the difference between right and wrong especially when viewed as an innate quality of the human mind, which is described as the moral faculty.
Moral concepts are terms involving ethical praise or blame, concerned with virtue and vice or rules of right conduct. Here, moral virtue is distinct from intellectual virtue just as moral laws are different from legal and institutional laws. Other aspects of moral discipline include moral rights, moral force, moral responsibility, moral courage, moral behaviour and moral victory.
Buddhist view
What is the criterion of moral discipline according to Buddha The answer is found in the word of advice given by the Buddha to the young samanera Rahula. "While you are doing a bodily action, you should reflect on it: 'This bodily action I am doing  is it leading to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both Is it an unskilful bodily action, with painful consequences, painful results' If, on reflection, you know that it is leading to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both... you should give it up. But if on reflection you know that it is not... you may continue with it. (Rahulovada Sutta)
The Buddhist view is that moral behaviour flows naturally from mastering one's ego, desires, cultivating loving kindness (metta), and compassion (karuna). The foundation teaching of Buddhism, expressed in the Four Noble Truths, is that the stress and unhappiness of life (dukkha) is caused by our desires and ego-clinging. The "program," for letting go of desire and ego is the Eightfold Path.
Ethical conduct - through speech, action and livelihood - is part of the path, as are mental discipline - through concentration and mindfulness - and wisdom.
The moral conduct in Buddha's teaching is centred around internal or individual rather than the things external to the individual. Buddhist practice of moral discipline is not done out of fear of any person or super-natural power. An external agent does not impose it. It has to come from within. It is the basis for further mental development.
Taming behaviour
In essence, moral discipline is the practice of taming bodily and verbal behaviours. The noble eightfold path explains it beautifully: Samma Vaca, Samma Kammanta, Samma Ajiva) or right speech, right action, and right livelihood. The next three factors may be treated together, as collectively they make up the path for moral discipline (silakkhandha).
Though the principles laid down in this section restrain immoral actions and promote good conduct, their ultimate purpose is not so much ethical as spiritual. They are not prescribed merely as guides to action, but primarily as aids to mental purification.
Refraining from false speech, slander, harsh speech and gossip is the practice of right words. Right actions are refraining from killing other beings, stealing and sexual misconduct. Right livelihood is refraining from livelihood that harms other beings, such as selling weapons, poison etc.
Need for moral discipline
Today, as a society, we are amidst a state of turmoil. Cherished ethics are being upturned. The forces of materialistic scepticism have turned their dissecting blades on the traditional concepts of what were considered humane qualities.
Yet, any sane person will understand that ethical issues play the most important role in his relationship with himself, his family and the society. For ethics has to do with human conduct. The need for ethics arises from the fact that man is not perfect by nature; he has to train himself to be good. Moral discipline in Buddhism is essentially practical in that it is only a means leading to the final goal of ultimate happiness. On the Buddhist path to the state of perfect well-being, each individual is considered responsible for his own fortunes and misfortunes. Each individual is expected to work his own deliverance by his understanding and effort. The Buddha's mission was to enlighten men as to the nature of existence and to advise them how best to act for their own happiness and for the benefit of others.
The theory of Buddhist ethics finds its practical expression in the various precepts. These precepts or disciplines are nothing but general guides to show the direction in which the Buddhist ought to turn to on his way to happiness.
In Buddhism, the distinction between what is good and what is bad is very simple: all actions that have their roots in greed, hatred, and delusion that spring from selfishness foster the harmful delusion of selfhood. They are called Akusala Kamma. All those actions which are rooted in the virtues of generosity, love and wisdom, are meritorious-and called Kusala Kamma.
The criteria of good and bad apply whether the actions are of thought, word or deed.Moral discipline in Buddhism is not a rocket-science invention of an exceptional mind, but a rational and a practical code based on verifiable facts.
That is why Prof. Max Muller of the Oxford University said that Buddhist moral code is the most perfect which the world has ever known. The Buddhist moral discipline is well illustrated in the Sigalovada, Vyagghapajja, Parabhava, Vasala, Mangala, Metta and the Dhammika suttas, in the Dhammapada.

New Law and Order Cabinet Minister in two weeks
Co-Cabinet Spokesman Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday said a new Cabinet Minister for Law and Order will be appointed in two weeks and the decision to appoint Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka has not yet been finalized.
The Minister said the Prime Minister was sworn in as the Law and Order Minister for only two weeks. Proposals were brought to appoint Field Marshal Fonseka as the Law and Order Minister but he was abroad when the Cabinet reshuffle took place, the Minister said.
The Minister was responding to a question from a journalist at the weekly Cabinet media briefing held at the Government Information Department, yesterday.
There is nothing strange in appointing Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Law and Order Minister and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa also took the same Ministry under his purview for a period of nearly two years, said the Minister.

New look policy
The much awaited Cabinet reshuffle finally took place last Sunday but has left in its wake more uncertainty. It has not been the stabilising factor that it was touted to be for the National Unity government which is grappling with the losses encountered at the recent local government elections.
The elections were a loud wake-up call for both partners in the government, the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) because their common rival, the newly formed Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) swept the polls and captured 45 per cent of the vote.
In the aftermath of the election President Maithripala Sirisena assured SLFP parliamentarians backing him that he would initiate a change that would be felt. Following this, there were suggestions to remove Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe from office, so as to give the National Unity government a new look.
Initially, when this was proposed to the UNP with the suggestion that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya be made Prime Minister, Jayasuriya politely but firmly rebuffed the move. Thereafter, attempts were made by SLFP MPs to collect signatures for a motion of no-confidence against the Prime Minister. Obviously, they could not obtain the required number of signatures, so those moves came to naught.
Cabinet reshuffle
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe remained calm in the face of all this and appeared before the media stating that he would remain in office according to the Constitution which has, in the wake of the 19th Amendment, no specific clause where the President can remove the Prime Minister from office.
It was against such a backdrop of political events that the Cabinet reshuffle took place. That it was earlier scheduled to be held on Wednesday last week but was postponed twice until it eventually took place on Sunday indicated that there was much debate, discussion and disputes related to it.
For most observers, the reshuffle was an anti-climax. What was expected was a complete overhaul of the Cabinet, the retirement of a few seniors past their prime and the introduction of young blood. That could have conveyed the impression that the Unity Government was indeed genuine in mending its ways after the verdict from the electorate.
That did not eventuate. Instead, only a few portfolios changed hands and that too only among UNP ministers. The changes in portfolios were also restricted mostly to exchanges among ministers. The only new Cabinet minister was Ravindra Samaraweera who has been elevated to Cabinet rank as Minister for Sustainable Development and Wildlife.
Perhaps the most significant change was the appointment of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as Minister of Law and Order, a post earlier held by Minister Sagala Ratnayaka who took oaths as Minister of Youth Affairs and Southern Development instead.
Battle against corruption
In fact, the key ministry of Law and Order was a bone of contention in the lead up to the reshuffle and was one of the reasons why it was delayed. The UNP was keen to appoint Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to that Ministry. It was argued that being a military man with a track record of achieving his objectives, he was ideally suited to lead the battle against corruption.
The UNP parliamentary group strongly favoured this idea. That was because the feedback they received from their electorates indicated that not dealing with the alleged corrupt activities of the former regime and not bringing its offenders to book was a major factor in the UNP being relegated to second best at the local government election.
Fonseka himself, never shy to state his ambitions made public remarks that if he is given the portfolio he would clean up the mess in six months. It is understood that an influential section of the SLFP was against this move and urged President Sirisena against appointing Fonseka to this portfolio.
Following the reshuffle where Prime Minister Wickremesinghe took oaths as the Minister of Law and Order, it was reported that the Prime Minister would hold the portfolio for a few weeks. Thereafter, a new minister would be appointed, these reports said.
Initially, there was speculation that Thalatha Atukorale would be appointed Minister of Law and Order. Atukorale is now Justice Minister as her portfolio of Foreign Employment was assigned to Minister Harin Fernando in the reshuffle in addition to his portfolio of Digital Infrastructure.
However, at a subsequent press briefing, Cabinet Spokesman Minister Rajitha Senaratne was to say that the portfolio would indeed be assigned to Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka. Observers however note that Dr. Senaratne is quite generous with his statements at these briefings and most of his predictions in the past have not become reality.
The other notable but much anticipated change in the reshuffle was the swap of subjects between Minister Lakshman Kiriella, who is the Leader of the House and Minister Kabir Hashim who is also General Secretary of the UNP. Hashim is now the Minister of Higher Education and Highways while Kiriella is the Minister of Public Enterprise Development as well as being Minister of Kandurata Development.
It is no secret that that there has been widespread criticism of the Cabinet reshuffle, despite announcements that more changes are to follow, possibly involving the reshuffling of SLFP Ministers. The Cabinet did not get the anticipated new look and there was no infusion of young blood although Ajith P. Perera and Dr. Harsha de Silva were elevated to the rank of state ministers, alongside the sole SLFPer to be sworn-in, Piyasena Gamage who took office as State Minister for Youth Affairs and Southern Development.
Many UNPers were dissatisfied with the reshuffle and two have already said so. The first was the State Minister for Foreign Affairs, Wasantha Senanayake. Leaving the Presidential Secretariat after the swearing -in ceremony, Senanayake said that the first part of a comedy produced by the Government had been enacted and that a second part was due shortly. I dont know how people will react, they may laugh, cry or pelt stones, Senanayake said.
UNP leadership
A day later, State Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training Range Bandara also stated that the Cabinet reshuffle would not benefit the UNP in any way. Bandara however is fighting his own internal battle in the UNP. He has already offered his resignation as the UNP organiser for Anamaduwa and is now urging for a change in the UNP leadership.
There is speculation within the UNP that a section of the SLFP is only buying time by seeking to thwart major changes to the Cabinet such as the appointment of Field Marshal Fonseka as Law and Order Minister. UNPers are concerned that the SLFPs putsch to oust Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe still continues with the tacit backing of the dissident faction of the party who now form the SLPP.
They note that the Cabinet reshuffle that took place last Sunday will not improve the UNPs image in the eyes of the public.
In fact, it may have taken a further beating as there is a general public sentiment of dissatisfaction over the reshuffle which amounted to only cosmetic changes between the same colleagues.
At this stage, what is certain is only that there will be yet another reshuffle. Whether that will remedy that perception or lead to more dissatisfaction within the ranks of the UNP remains to be seen. With less than two years to go for the next presidential election, time is running out, not just for the Sirisena faction of the SLFP, but also for the UNP.

Pakistan ban Shahzaib Hasan for year
LAHORE, Wednesday: Pakistan Wednesday hit former opener Shahzaib Hasan with a one-year ban and a million rupee ($9,050) fine for a spot-fixing incident that rocked the country's Twenty20 League last year.
Hasan, 28, was a member of Pakistan's World Twenty20 winning team in 2009 but had not played any international cricket in the past eight years.
Hasan, who was playing for the Karachi Kings, was one of six players charged with various breaches of the Pakistan Cricket Board's anti-corruption code during the second edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) held in the United Arab Emirates.
"Hasan has been banned for one year and fined one million rupees on one charge and we have requested for more action against him on inducing other players for fixing," board legal adviser Taffazul Rizvi told the media.
Hasan, an aggressive opener, played three one-day internationals and 10 Twenty20 internationals before losing his place due to poor performance in 2010.
The PSL was rocked by scandal in February last year when it was announced that several players were caught in a spot-fixing incident.
Spot-fixing involves determining the outcome of a specific part of a match rather than the overall result, and is therefore harder to detect than match-fixing.
The PCB formed a three-man tribunal which later banned Sharjeel Khan for five years (two and a half suspended) while Khalid Latif was banned for five full years and fined one million rupees. Mohammad Irfan was banned for one year (six months suspended), Mohammad Nawaz for two months (one suspended) and Nasir Jamshed for one year.
The third edition of the PSL is currently being staged in the UAE, with two play-offs in Lahore and the final in Karachi on March 25.
The PCB took extra measures to stem spot-fixing, with all six teams in this year's league monitored by anti-corruption officers.
Pakistan has a history of fixing, with former captain Salim Malik and Ataur Rehman banned for life in 2000. A spot-fixing case during Pakistan's tour of England in 2010 ended in five-year bans on then Test captain Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir.
Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria is also serving a life ban on charges of spot-fixing during a county match in England in 2009. AFP

Path cherished for centuries
Magganatthangiko settho saccanam caturo padaVirago settho dhammanam  dipadanam ca cakkhuma -273.
Esova maggo natthaanno dassanassa visuddhiyaEtamhi tumhe patipajjatha marassetam pamohanam  274.
The best of paths is the Eight-fold Path. The best of truths are the four Sayings. Non-attachment is the best of states. The best of bipeds is the Seeing One. - 273.
This is the only Way. There is none other for the purity of vision. Tread this path. This is the bewilderment of Mara.-274
-Quoted from The Dhammapada  by Venerable Narada Thera - Magga Vagga- verses 273 & 274.
Noble means good, great, perfect or highest in value. The Noble Eight-fold Path is the path that leads to the end of Dukkha. It is also known as the Middle Way (Majjhima Patipada). Dukkha is the unsatisfactory nature in life.
Things that are impermanent by nature apparently look like things that are permanent. So the worldly being (Puthujjana) holds on or clings to these fleeting objects. Thus the individual tries to satisfy himself/ herself, but fails to no avail. This is Dukkha, the unsatisfactory nature in life. When practiced earnestly, the Noble Eight-fold Path leads to emancipation, helping one to put an end to Dukkha or pain.
The two extremes are self-indulgence and self-mortification. One needs to avoid these two extremes and tread along the Middle Way if one is to be happy in life. Giving too much of pleasure to the body is self-indulgence whereas torturing or giving immense pain to the body is known as self-mortification.
Self-mortification
Before becoming the Buddha, when He was Prince Siddhartha, leading a life of pleasure in the Royal palace, the path He chose was self-indulgence. The moment the Prince renounced worldly life and opted to live as a hermit in the forest, the path He selected was self-mortification.
The hermits at the time harboured a firm belief that torturing the body would serve as a solution in emancipating themselves. As such Prince Siddhartha too inclined towards the practice of torturing the body. For instance, practices like eating less food, sometimes only a fruit that falls down beside Him, meditating in the hot sun etc.
The eight factors of the Noble Eight-fold Path are namely Right view, Right thought, Right speech, Right action, Right livelihood, Right effort, Right mindfulness and Right concentration (unification of the mind).
Right view- In one way it is: understanding of the Four Noble Truths: the unsatisfactory nature in life (Dukkha), the cause of Dukkha, the cessation of Dukkha, the Path that leads to the end of Dukkha.
In another way, it is: understanding the reality in life. Apparently, worldly things are permanent; but the reality is: Every phenomenon (except Nibbana) is subject to change, impermanent. That is the uncertainty in life.
Right thought- Thoughts of renunciation (Nekkhamma Sankappa)-
This could also imply letting go here and now. That is to use material (worldly) things with understanding, considering the need, rather than the greed.
Thoughts of non-anger (Avyapada Sankappa)-
Not to be angry with anyone and harbor thoughts of destroying any life but to radiate boundless thoughts on Loving-Kindness to all sentient beings (Metta).
Thoughts of non-harming (Avihimsa Sankappa)-
Not to harm any living creature but to be kind to all living beings.
Right speech- It is the correct use of words. One refrains from wrong ways of speech: Lying, backbiting (telling tales), gossip or idle talk and abusive language/ speaking harsh words. When one refrains from such talk, then naturally pure words would spring from ones mouth. Such words would be pleasing and soothing to the ear.
Right action- It is to perform meritorious, good deeds. Kusala means skillful. Kusalakamma or Skillful actions are as follows: to refrain from taking the life of another (including oneself), to refrain from taking what is not given and to refrain from sexual misconduct. The precept to refrain from taking any intoxicants is not included here, as suppose this precept is violated, it would cause the violation of any of the above mentioned three precepts.
Moreover, the meritorious deeds one could perform are Generosity (Dana), Virtue/ Discipline/observance of the precepts (Sila) and meditation/mental culture (Bhavana). These are known as the three kinds of meritorious deeds (Thrivida punya kriya).
The ten kinds of meritorious deeds (Dasa punya kriya) include the above three kinds of meritorious deeds and the other meritorious deeds are attending the daily chores such as keeping the home, the school and the temple clean and tidy (Veyyavacca), honouring or having due respect to the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha, teachers and elders (Apacayana), transference of merit (Pattidana), rejoicing in others merits (Pattanumodana), expounding the Dhamma/ having Dhamma discussions/ publishing books on Dhamma (Desana), listening to the Dhamma (Suti) and straightening of ones views (making an effort to realize the impermanent nature of all worldly phenomena, understanding the Four Noble Truths) (Ditthijjukamma).
Right livelihood- It is to refrain from the five illegal trades: selling of animals, selling of flesh, selling of poison, selling of weapons and selling of liquor.
When one refrains from these five illegal trades, then one could make ones living through rightful means.
Right effort- It is the four ways of putting forth effort (Satara sammappadana virya) in ones practice:
To keep refraining from the evil not yet arisen.To refrain from the evil already arisen.To perform the good not yet performed.
To perform the good already performed again and again and bring such good deeds into fruition.
Right mindfulness- It is to be mindful in what you do.
Kayanupassana  being mindful in ones bodily movements: when breathing in and out, walking, standing, sitting and lying down, reflecting over the loathsomeness of the body, reflecting over the four great elements of the body namely solidity, fluidity, heat and air, reflecting over the nine stages of the corpse when discarded after death (Nava sivathikaya) etc.
Vedananupassana  being mindful on sensations arising in the body. The three kinds of sensations arising in the body are namely painful sensation, pleasurable sensation and neutral (neither pleasant nor painful sensation.
Cittanupassana It is to be mindful and aware of thoughts arising in the mind: the lustful mind, the lust-free mind, the mind filled with hatred, the mind free of hate, the ignorant mind, the mind free of ignorance (the knowing mind), the scattered mind, the collected mind etc. Dhammanupassana  being mindful amidst the occurrence of the five hindrances, the five aggregates, the six sense doors namely the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and mind and the arising of the seven factors of enlightenment (Sapta Bojjhanga) etc.
Right concentration  the unification of the mind gained through focusing ones mind on a particular object (something moral, free of lust, hate and delusion). As an example: In Anapanasati meditation, the object is the breath whereas in Meditation on Loving-Kindness, the object is metta (Loving  Kindness)
Noble Eight-fold Path
In the Noble eight-fold Path, the factors Right speech, Right action and Right livelihood are categorized as Sila. The factors Right effort, Right mindfulness and Right concentration are categorized as Samadhi and the factors Right view and Right thought are categorized as Panna(Wisdom).
Reflecting on the Noble Eight-fold Path in the right way is being attentive in this present moment. Being mindful and aware in this present moment with clear comprehension thus is known as Yoniso Manasikaraya.
Abhikkhante patikkhante sampajanakari hoti,Alokite vilokite sampajanakari hoti,Samminjite pasarite sampajanakari hoti,Sanghati pattacivara dharanesampajanakari hoti,Asite pite kayite sayite sampajanakari hoti,Uccara passava kammesampajanakari hoti,Gate tite nisinne sutte jagarite bhasite tunhibhavesampajanakari hoti,
One is aware, for instance, in visiting a religious institute and attending the religious activities there and afterwards in leaving and returning from the religious institute; this could also suggest being aware at the start of a certain task, the time of attending the task and at the end of the task, or else when engaged in walking meditation, one makes oneself fully alert and conscious of what one is doing;
when looking ahead and looking around,when bending and extending ones limbs,
when carrying ones outer cloak, ones upper robe and ones almsbowl (for a monk)/ when wearing clothes and using cup and plate,
when eating, drinking, chewing and savoring,when urinating and defecating,
when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking and remaining silent one makes oneself fully alert.
After all, just as a physician diagnoses a patient and prescribes medicine accordingly so does the Blessed One gives us two prescriptions: One is Sila, Samadhi and Panna (Wisdom) and the other is Dana, Sila and Bhavana. These are to be followed in our daily lives.
Further the Blessed One proclaimed: Imassakalebarassalokan capannapemi, loka samudayan ca pannapemi, loka nirodhan ca pannapemi, loka nirodhagamini patipadan ca pannapemi.
In this fathom-long body I perceive the arising of Dukkha, the cause of Dukkha, the cessation of Dukkha and the path that which leads to the cessation of Dukkha.
One may fail in ones endeavor to follow the Noble-eight fold path and be good. However, no matter how many times one fails one should do the right thing in his / her following approach as the Dhammapada verse goes:
Yo ca pubbe pamajjitva  paccha so nappamajjatiSomam lokam pabhaseti  abbha muttova candima.
Whoever was heedless before and afterwards is not; such a one illumines this world like the moon freed from clouds.

President instructs immediate resettlement
The government has given priority for the resettlement of farmer families being evacuated in order for the Lower Malwathu Oya Reservoir Project to be carried out smoothly. President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed relevant authorities to immediately begin the resettlement process before commencing the main construction components of the project. In order to avoid any complications similar to those being experienced by the Anuradhapura Yan Oya Reservoir scheme, where construction work for the resettlement programme is lagging behind.
It has been planned to block the Yan Oya near Thanthirimale with a 3.5-km long main dam. At present, the surveying of the resettlement landscapes is in progress.
The capacity of the proposed reservoir is 169,440 acre-feet and the landscapes being acquired for the project is around 10,900 acres. The estimated cost for the project is Rs. 12.5 million. The main objectives of the project are providing irrigational water to cultivate around 35,000 acres in the Anuradhapura and Mannar districts; providing drinking water to people in the Anuradhapura, Vavuniya, and Mannar districts; and to address the annual flood threat being experienced in the Malwathu Oya downstream areas.
Referring to the present situation of the project, Anuradhapura government Agent and Lower Malwathu Oya Reservoir Project Progress Review Committee Head R. M. Wanninayake told the Daily News that a landscape of around 22,000 acres have been identified in Kaluwila, Narawila, Nalanda, Gatamuna, Randeniya, and Handapangoda for the resettlement of 600 farmer families.
"There are several problems to be resolved. Some of the locations selected for resettlement programme come under the high-conserved jungle belt of the Wilpattu National Park, belonging to both wildlife and the forest conservation departments. This issue has arisen regarding the landscapes proposed to be given as muddy lands to families being evacuated from the Handapangoda, Dematamalgoda, and Thanthirimale divisions," the government agent said.
With regard to the destitute families in the Thammennaalawaka in Medawachchiya Divisional Secretariate divisions, the muddy lands planned to be provided could be allocated close to where the affected families currently reside at, instead of providing accommodations in the south bank area, Wanninayaka added.
He added that as such, alternative muddy lands could be demarcated in more suitable and less forested zones along the south bank.
According to the government agent, those who are currently deprived of both muddy lands and highlands could be provided with such lands in adjoining areas located in the said south bank zone.
Wanninayake further said that if the resettlement programme has been adjusted as such that the highly conserved landscapes within the Wilpattu National Park would be intact and protected and added that the human-elephant conflict could be thwarted, while the productivity of the new settlement is enhanced. He said he would submit a report including the proposed recommendations and adjustments to the government.

GALGAMUWA TENSE DUE TO WATER ISSUE:
PROTESTERS AGAINST COMPANY BOTTLING WATER
A tense situation had erupted at the Thambuttegama town as police fired tear gas and water cannons at protesters who were pelting stones at the Thambuttegama Police Station yesterday.
The Police Media reported that the police had arrested 39 men and five women in the process.
Tambuttegama Police in the meantime have also reported that four of its officers had incurred minor injuries during the clash and were admitted to hospital.
A large number of villagers had gathered near the police station staging a protest blocking the Kurunegala-Anuradhapura road at the Police Junction in Thambuttegama, in protest against water of the Rajanganaya Wewa being given to a Chinese company.
The protestors claimed that the Rajanganaya Wewa provides water to 17,000 acres of cultivations by the villagers, but the authorities had now given permission to a Chinese bottled water company to utilise the Rajanganaya Wewa water, depriving the farmers of water for their cultivation.
The entire village had joined in the protest which blocked the Kurunegala-Anuradhapura main road, causing heavy traffic congestion.
However, when contacted for comments, the Police Media Spokesmans Office said they had not received any information regarding the incident.

Psychotherapy of the Buddhas approach
Surely, if I am worthy of any affection or care, Sidhuhatt will come and see me  Bimbadevi
K K S PERERA 
Neutralised the pride of relatives; respondedto anxieties of Yasodharavo and prince Nanda-The Buddha spoke caringly to Yasodharavo, telling of her boundlessvirtues inherited from previous lives. She had indeed been repeatedly of great backing to him. Her pureness, her devotion,her gentleness, had been precious to the Bodhisattva when he aspired to triumph over enlightenment, the highest objective of mankind. And so virtuous had she been that she favoured to become the wife of a Bodhisattva.The realities of mind are more important than realities of body  WilliamJames- American Psychologist.
Leading men in the psychological field like Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Otto Rank and Adler used hypnosis as the basis for examining the cause, but gave up developing the concept of Free Association, another skill that the Buddha practiced as well. The Buddha attached lot of importance to development of cooperation and attachment between therapist and patient; quite a few modern psychologists have professed this line of treatment.
Psycho and neuro-pathological complications are now receiving admirable attention in scientific training, exactly what the Buddha taught 26 centuries ago. Modern medicine confesses that there is an ultimate inter-dependence of mind and body at all phases of physical ailments. Buddhist teachings however, go a step further; it adds more importance to mental faculties, it says mind is the fore-runner of all sensations and occurrences.
Childhood relations
King Suddhodana, was particularly concerned about meeting his son. Nine messengers carried his request to Buddha asking him to visit Kimbulwattpura; all of them became followers and stayed back at Rajagaha Nuwara. Finally, the king turned to Kaaludai, the childhood friend of Sidhuhath. Buddha left Rajagaha in a two month-voyage delivering Dhamma to inhabitants on the way, before reaching Kapilawastupura onMedin Poya day.
Buddha had to exhibit delusionary effects to neutralize the pride of his relatives using his psychic powers, Yamamaha. The following morning the Buddhas entourage was on alms rounds, where he had to explain his ancestry to a shocked father who objected to him. The king and other family seniors in the kingdom received the Buddha with great reverence except Yasodharavo, the mother of Rahula. She chose to stay inside her chambers. The most passionately focused event was the meeting between the Buddha and Yasodharavo that took place at the Suddodhanas palace. The king sent a message to Yasodhara who replied in the negative. Instead, she expected the Buddha to visit her chamber.
Surely, if I am worthy of any affection or care, Sidhuhatt will come and see me  Bimbadevi
Unassertive character
Having learnt that she had turned down the appeal, the Buddha, accompanied by his two chief disciples Sariputta and Moggallana straight away walked to her compartment signifying his unassertive character and well-mannered regard for his former partner in samsara.
Bimbadevi not having seen me for a long time, she is extremely distressed, unless you allow its natural course her heart will slash. In the event she touches me lets not prevent her She was relaxing in her room dressed in uncaring fabrics, and her haircut. As the Buddha cross the doorstep from the wealth of her warmth, like a brimming bowl she was unable to hold her admiration. For a moment she failed to recall that her precious man was now the noblest of the world, she seized his feet and wept frantically. However, seeing that the king was present, she rose. By allowing Bimbavo to spend-off her grievance in that harmless wayhe taught the world a lesson in Psychotherapy.
Sabbe Satta Ummattaka-Buddha said it is hard to find a being in perfect bodily health: but indeed far more challenging to find a completely mentally well person- Roga Sutta [Annguttara Nikaya].
Leading men in the psychological field like Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Otto Rank and Adler used hypnosis as the basis for examining the cause, but gave up developing the concept of Free Association, another skill that the Buddha practiced as well. The Buddha attached lot of importance to development of cooperation and attachment between therapist and patient; quite a few modern psychologists have professed this line of treatment.
The two-way or dialog form sermonizing used by the Buddha has a close parallel to what todays psychiatric approach to mental patients. Buddhist psychotherapy cures mental sicknesses, enables understanding of the working of their conscious and unconscious minds. One can use it to build up his own mental wellbeing in todays stressful society. The aspects that cause mental illnesses are recognized as kleshes or mental destructions. The fundamental vision behind this method is found in Sabbasava Sutta, Satipattana Sutta, and Vattupama Sutta-[Majjima Nik.,]
Saga of celestial nymphs
Buddha visited his step-brother Prince Nanda the next day at his palace, who was planning to get married to the most gracious woman of the time, Janapada Kalyani, the loveliest girl of the kingdom the next day. As he was leaving them, Buddha gave over his bowl to Nanda. Janapada Kalyani saw the prince walking away and requested his quick return. Kalyani was highly thrilled with the prospect of her marriage. Prince Nanda expected the Buddha to take back the bowl near the entrance to monastery; he did not do. So, Buddha had taken him to the monastery to give up house-hold life.
At the monastery he was inspired by the arguments of the Buddha and accepted the renunciation, but his willpower was weak and feeble. He was pined for his gorgeous bride with strong sensual longings, which gradually affected his health. However, Rev Nanda spoke to colleagues thus;
I am discontented with leading the sacred life, friends, I am unable to bear the holy life, which was communicated to the Buddha; Nanda Thera admitted the fact, saying, The warm and loving words and her beloveds tears enthused me deeply and continues to do so. The Buddha, who with his heavenly eye saw that Nanda, with a little strength of mind, could grasp the Dhamma and supreme satisfaction of insight. He thought of a little psycho-analytic therapy to retain him without disturbing his present frame of mind. The Buddha asked him to accompany him to the Himalayan range; the Lord took him by the arm, left Jeta-wood and appeared among idols of Thawatimsa. Hundreds of pink-footed nymphs had come to minister to Sakkra, the chronicle says.
Celestial Nymphs, Janapada Kalyaniand the charred monkey
What do you think, Nanda, who is more beautiful, fairer to look at, and more appealing [Buddha made Nanda witness a scene of a charred body of a female monkey in a Chena.] Kalyanie or the gorgeous celestial nymphs Replying Nanda said, compared to these nymphs that girl is like the charred body of the female monkey. The Buddha practicing a bit of psychology of his immature mind assured him to get him any of those nymphs as his bride to be, on condition that he will not leave the monastery. Revered sir if you guaranty I shall be content with monastic life he quickly replied.
Buddha was the physician and the surgeon of the psyche. He believed in treating the cause, not the symptoms [Nidhana], exactly what they practice in modern psychotherapy. According to Dhamma, all human chaos are basically mind related and stems from three harmful motivating factors, namely, attraction Lobha, repulsion Dhosa and delusion Moha. The story of the prince had been unjustly distorted in many a script. Nanda though in his excitement agreed, when he reached the monastery where other monks questioned his initiation for monk-hood, they laughed at him and called him menial and hireling, he felt humiliated, embarrassed and he eventually saw his motive as the basepsychotherapy worked; and renouncing desire soon he gathered up his nerve. Realised the coarseness of all compounded things and endeavoured for attainment and Nanda became an Arhant. It was an instant where Buddha used his skills in psycho-therapy.
Our legendary writer, author, and intellectual Martin Wickremasinghe once said, Psycho-analysis was not initiated by Sigmund Freud, but by Jataka story teller.

Rosy urges EC Chairman to intervene in ensuring 25% quota in LG bodies
Mayor-elect of Colombo Rosy Senanayake expressed her frustration at the failure of the political parties to ensure 25% mandatory female representation in Local Government bodies.
Addressing the Womens Day event organized by the Ministry of Tourism Development and Christian Affairs and the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority on February 28, Senanayake urged the Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya to make the necessary intervention in this regard.
In the run up to the election, he was very firm in making sure that every political party contesting the election fulfills the 25% mandatory representation of women on their nominations lists. In fact, nomination papers presented by some parties were rejected as they did not meet the mandatory representation, she explained, delivering the keynote speech at the event.
But now, Senanayake said, political parties are reluctant to ensure the 25% representation in Local Government bodies. They are not ready to provide female candidates an opportunity. I have spoken to the Elections Commission Chairman many a time, in this regard. I have urged him to intervene, she said.
They are looking at every possible excuse to deprive female candidates of the opportunity to represent Local Government bodies. They are going through each and every clause to find a contradiction. This has to stop, Senanayake stressed, adding that she could not see the newly elected members of the Local Government bodies taking oaths before the 10th of next month.
The Mayor-elect, however, commended Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for his initiative to introduce a mandatory female representation.
We fought the good fight for a long time. If not for the Prime Minister, I must say, we would still be fighting the good fight, she added, stating that the entire Parliament voted in favour of this new legislation.
Senanayake said women, who are the majority of the countrys population, should have a fair representation in every sector, at every level.
She also stressed for the need of more female participation in the tourism sector, especially in the hospitality industry.

The members are: Jayatheepa Punniyamoorthy, Major General Mohanti Antonette Peiris, Dr Sriyani Nimalka Fernando, Mirak Raheem, Sumanasiri Liyanage and Kanapathipillai Venthan.
OMP Chairman Peiris speaking to Daily News said all members would meet next week to decide on their future course of action and how the office would be set up.
The OMP (establishment, administration and discharge of functions) was established through Act No.14 of 2016 and amended by Act No.9 of 2017 and came into effect on September 15.
The Act stipulated that the OMP would, Provide for the establishment of the office on missing persons; to provide for the searching and tracing of missing persons; to provide assistance to relatives of missing persons; for the setting up of a database of missing persons; for setting out the procedures and guidelines applicable to the powers and functions assigned to the said office; and to provide for all matters which are connected with or incidental to, the implementation of the provisions of this act.
In December 2017, the Constitutional Council nominated the names of seven persons to the OMP, having selected them from over 100 applications and the 2018 Budget allocated Rs 1.4 billion for the OMP.
The OMP is one of the four big transitional justice mechanisms proposed by the government, o0thers being an office to handle reparations, a truth commission and a judicial mechanism to address allegations of wartime abuses.
According to the last Paranagama Commission appointed to investigate into missing persons; close to 19,000 persons have been confirmed to have gone missing during the three decade war. The UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has recorded 12,000 cases of enforced disappearances related to the Janatha Vimukthi Perumuna (JVP) uprisings and during the armed conflict between Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)and the Sri Lankan government forces from 1980 to 2010.

Bangladesh received a jolt with skipper Shakib Al Hasan not receiving a go-ahead on his finger injury from his doctors in Bangkok and continues to remain doubtful for the upcoming tri-nation Nidahas Trophy.
The Bangladesh all-rounder, who consulted an orthopedician in Bangkok to take stock of his injury, has already been included in the squad for the tournament to be held in Sri Lanka. BCB took the bold step of naming Shakib in the side with a hope that he will recover during some point of the tournament. However, as per his doctor, he might need up to two weeks of physiotherapy before taking the field.
"We are yet to take any decision regarding him whether he will be treated in Bangkok or Australia or will return and do the rehabilitation here," BCB chief physician Debashish Chowdhury said on Wednesday.
"But his chance of participation is very slim. Still he can be part of the touring side in Sri Lanka if we opt to take him for mentoring the side with the hope that he can be available whenever he gets fit but that does not look to be possible during the tournament considering his condition," he further added.
According to BCB insiders, even if the all-rounder undergoes 10 days of physiotherapy, he will still require a few more days under observation before being ready to take the field, in all likelihood for the last game of the tournament if everything goes precisely as per plan.
"We are not clear about his status," chief selector Minhajul Abedin said. "But it is very unlikely that he will be available soon." BCB, earlier on Monday, had announced a 16-member squad keeping Shakib's injury in mind. At that time, it was expected that he will miss the first two games.

Shock treatment
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka has called on the government to implement a crash programme for the next 18 months that covers both, the social, and, economic aspects, affecting the masses. He said cosmetic and policy changes would serve no purpose at this particular time. The minister said he was working on such a programme in consultation with other ministries and it will be presented soon.
Minister Ranawaka, a professional engineer, and, known for his pragmatic viewpoints that even clash with that of the government he serves, no doubt, has come to his conclusion after a dispassionate assessment of the results of the recent LG elections, where the government fared badly, to it mildly. The voters certainly had responded in the manner they did due to many shortcomings, nay blunders, on the part of the government, that those like Minister Ranawaka thinks should be rectified, and, rectified fast, if it is to make any headway electoral wise.
They (voters) crave for quick fix solutions and are not enamoured by high flown concepts, or, principles and practices in true democracies that are taken for granted in the west. Nor, are they interested in long term macroeconomic policies with a long gestation period that may or may not bear fruit in the end. Features of good governance like the The Right to Information Act, or, political reforms like additional womens representation in parliament or the local bodies, laudable as they are, have no resonance with the ordinary public. Nor the promises to introduce the tools for modern techniques in education, or, the creation of industrial zones, in the rural hinterland. What the vast majority of our people need are the basics that would sustain them in their day-to-day lives.
This reality, sadly, had escaped the attention of the powers that be, in the Yahapalanaya government, for which it had to pay a heavy price at the LG elections.
But all is not lost. The government still has time to atone for its lapses and forge ahead determinedly by taking to heart the suggestion of Minister Ranawaka. Indeed, a crash programme, or, more precisely, shock treatment is what the government needs now to rouse it from its slumber and get its act together.
To begin with, a comprehensive study, or, a postmortem should be carried out on the election results to meaningfully ascertain where the government had been found wanting. It is very clear that, both, the rural, and, urban voter had turned their backs on the government in equal measure. While factors such as slashing of the subsidies, wholesale withdrawal of Samurdhi, falling back in the distribution of fertilizer to the farmer, lack of a proper programme to purchase his harvest, the lack of water for cultivation etc. were among the chief issues with the rural voter, while the extremely high cost of living, allegations of corruption in the government, the long standing garbage problem, failure to compensate the Salawa and the Meethotamulla victims, the haphazard distribution of school uniforms and textbooks, the alleged sale of national assets, were, no doubt sore points with the urban voter.
The inadequate and ineffective response to charges of witch-hunts carried out against the rana viruvas by the Joint Opposition, and, the virulent campaign that the country was on the verge of division, as a result of the new constitution (although the Consultative Committees includes JO MP) also played its part to a great degree in alienating both, the urban and rural voter, from the government. The lack of an effective counter to the half truths and falsehoods propagated by the Pro-Rajapaksa media too went a long way towards influencing the voters to vote as they did.
All these have to be tackled cumulatively, in whatever crash programme that is being suggested by Minister Ranawaka, if the government is to make any headway. Dealing piecemeal or prioritizing a few issues only will not make a difference.
Above all, putting up a united front by the protagonists too is of extreme importance if the Yahapalanaya government is to continue its preset journey sans hiccups. The infighting among alliance partners, too, made a not inconsiderable dent in the January 8 and August 15 combined Yahapalanaya vote, as the results show.
Be that as it may, with the Provincial Council elections only months away, the crash programme envisaged by Minister Ranawaka should get moving in earnest. The Joint Opposition, presently on a roll, by the successes at the LG polls have already planned countrywide rallies to mobilize the masses. No doubt, it will hope to obtain the maximum mileage by demonstrating its popularity, via the crowds, at these rallies. The government ought to respond to this effectively, by launching a counter propaganda blitz of its own.
But, first it should show results on the ground. It is only by addressing all its shortcomings that have been listed above that the government will be able to muster the support of the people. It certainly would need a crash programme to wrest the initiative.

Significance of Medin Poya: Revisiting the shattered bonds
It was a show of grandeur when the Buddha visited his hometown. Not only humans, but many kind of deities had also visited to witness the arrival of the Buddha. The Conqueror preached the nature of the Buddhahood. He taught the importance of following percepts.
When the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu for the first time after his Enlightenment he stayed at the Nigrodharama monastery. There he expounded the Dhamma to his relatives. King Suddhodana thought that the Buddha, being his own son, would not go anywhere, but would surely come to the palace for almsfood the next day; but he did not specifically invite the Buddha. However, the next day, he ordered almsfood to be prepared for him and his bhikkhus.
As there was no special invitation for almsgiving on that day, the Buddha and his bhikkhus went on their almsround. Before proceeding he considered within himself, 'Did the Buddhas of the past, upon entering the city of their kinsfolk, straightaway enter the houses of the relatives, or did they go from house to house to receive alms' Perceiving that they did go from house to house, the Buddha went along the streets of Kapilavatthu seeking alms.
Begging alms
On hearing of this seemingly humiliating conduct of the Buddha from his daughter-in-law, Yasodhara, the King greatly perturbed, went to the Buddha and said, 'Son, why do you ruin me I am overwhelmed with shame to see you begging alms. Is it proper for you, who used to travel in a golden palanquin, to seek alms in this very city Why do you put me to shame'
Whereupon the Buddha replied, 'O King, I am not putting you to shame. I am following the custom of my Buddha lineage. All previous Buddhas have lived by seeking alms.'
The King understood that this was the way of the Buddhas and accepted it.
The Buddha preached the blessings of monkhood and listening to that both Prajapathi Gothami and King Suddhodana attained Sotapanna stage.
The Buddha discovered his wife in his lay life Yasodhara was missing in the crowd. He came to know she is residing in the balcony, and he chose to go up himself to see her. Then he preached the Sandakinduru Jataka. Listening to the Buddha, Yasodhara developed an interest to become a nun. But the Buddha had other plans. So he wanted Yasodhara to wait a little.
Crestfallen heart
It was a show of grandeur when the Buddha visited his hometown. Not only humans, but many kind of deities had also visited to witness the arrival of the Buddha. The Conqueror preached the nature of the Buddhahood. He taught the importance of following percepts.
Pajapathi's son Nanda and Yasodhara's son Rahula became monks too during this eve. These two sons, especially his own grandson Rahula was much consolation for King Suddhodana in the absence of Prince Siddhartha. He became much crestfallen. So the Buddha issued an act not to make children monks without consent of their parents. He preached Dharmapala Jataka during this event, and the King became Anagami. This was coordinated by Minister Kaludai. The Buddhas never visit their hometown without invitation.
Kaludai, on the other hand, had done so much merits in previous existences so he could maintain good relationship among relatives.

SLSCA president commends  Mother of all Shows
Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) president and the Principal of Dharmapala College, Pannipitiya, Oshara Panditharatne commended the country's oldest school cricket award ceremony with a history of four decades, the Sunday Observer- Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest as the most successful and transparent school cricket award ceremony ever in Sri Lanka.
He assured continues support of SLSCA to the 'Mother of all Shows'.
Panditharatne also mentioned that since Ranjan Madugalle received the first schoolboy cricketer award in 1979, so many recipients of this prestigious award went on to shine in national and international cricket scene.
"I am proud as the Principal of Dharmapala College that during this 40-year stint Dharmapala has also produced a top award winner in late 90s when all-rounder Chinthaka Jayasinghe was adjudged the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in 1997," he said.
Panditharatne also emphasized that this high profiled contest has provided great inspiration to school cricket generations, lifting their profiles high while opening doors for them to club and national level cricket.
When asked about the decline in school cricketers entering national level straight, Panditharatne said cricketing greats like Arjuna Ranatunga, Aravinda de Silva and Mahela jayawardena entered the national team straight from the school, but it is a globally rare phenomena. "We saw Kusal Mendis and Dinesh Chandimal don the national caps soon after schooling in the near past.
But I must say the school cricket is doing fine and developing rapidly with the great support from Sri Lanka Cricket," he further explained. Commenting on the ongoing big match season, Panditharatne said disciplinary problems have been a big topic with the intensified competition and great efforts by the players, supporters, parents, coaches and old boys of the schools in recent times. But as a remedy for this SLSCA with the assistance of Education Ministry has appointed a supervision officer for each big match, so hopefully there will be less disciplinary issues this time, He concluded.

SPC seeks to amend PC elections law
The Southern Provincial Council endorsed a resolution seeking amendments to the new Provincial Council Elections Act recently passed in Parliament with a majority of 17 votes.
The resolution, signed by 18 councillors, was submitted to the Council Chairman requesting him to allow the resolution to be tabled in the House as an urgent item in the days agenda. Accordingly, Council Deputy Chairman Sampath Athukorala presented the resolution, seconded by councillor Weerasumana Weerasinghe.
The resolution demands that the proposed proportional representation structure introduced in the new law should be amended to read as 70 percent councillors who contested under the electoral basis be elected from list 1 and 30 percent be selected from list 2 according to the Proportionate Representation system. The present law dictates the above representations to be 50 percent each.
Presenting the resolution, Sampath Athukorala told the House that the new election law under which the recent Local Government polls were conducted, had created immense practical problems and distorted representations. The new proportionate representation mechanism introduced by the new Provincial Council Election Act would generate serious complexities, he said. Following the submission of the proposal, Provincial Minister U. G. D. Ariyathilake made a request to suspend the debate on the resolution as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party councillors had to take part in a special meeting convened by the Presidents Office. Thereafter, Opposition Leader Tennakoon Nilame also said that almost all the UNP councillors also had to go to Colombo for an urgent meeting and asked for a reschedule of the debate on the move.
However, Chairman K. A. Somawansa opted to take up the debate on the proposal with the remaining number of councillors numbering 29. Accordingly, councillors Chandana Priyantha, Saman Cyril Kumara, D.V.Upul, and Aruna Gunarathe participated in the debate.
Finally, Chairman Somawansa took a vote over the proposal for which 23 councillors voted for while six councillors voted against it. Three UNP members and three JVP members who were present in the House voted against the move.

Sri Lanka mulls SME globalising kick-off via highly active food sector
Sri Lanka mulls linking its considerable SME base to global markets through a highly active industry sub-sector. The SMEs, a core sector of Sri Lankan economy creating more than 50 percent of its employment, have their biggest presence in food processing sub-sector.
There is a great number of micro and SME enterprises active in this industry. In fact we believe that more than 40 percent of our SMEs are in the food processing sector said Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen on February 27. Minister Bathiudeen was addressing the Pro Food-Pro Pack industry awards event at Colombos Kingsbury Hotel. He was joined by visiting industry representatives from India and China as well as Sri Lanka Food Processors Association President Maliek De Alwis and its Secretary Thusith Wijesinghe. The evening event also launched the 17th Pro Food-Pro Pack exhibition to be held this August. Launched by the Industry and Commerce Ministry in 2001, this series has become one of the largest food, beverages, packaging and agri-business events in South Asia.
This expo series is only one of the initiatives by my Ministry to help the processed food and packaging sector. Since the launch of this series in 2001 there has been much progress in the processed food sector by way of improvements in technology, packaging, product development, and marketing. I am given to understand that more than 50 firms from India and China shall be taking part at this Augusts Pro Food-Pro Pack expo in Colombo. I call the industry representatives from India and China taking part at this evening to invest in our food and packaging sectors and partner with our sectors. Our efforts to develop these sectors are a part of our bigger plan to link these sectors to our exports said Minister Bathiudeen.
The Minister said, My ministry has launched many projects for these sectors. The most important is the setting up of Sri Lankas first Accredited Food Laboratory for SMEs by the Industrial Development Board. This is the first such facility for the SME food sector of Sri Lanka. This lab is also the first lab that is ready to test food products from all Districts of Sri Lanka and will use both local and international standards such as SLS and ISO. Small scale food makers in Sri Lanka is a sub sector that needs support. We are continuing the Industrial Productivity Market Competitiveness and sustainability improvement programme for the sixth year. So far 100 companies benefited in Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and ISO 14000 certifications under this program. We are also continuing the 'Developing Small Scale Food Industries by Improving Processing Technology' project for them to give access to technology. We have decided to expand this as an island-wide project. Specially the SME and micro food producers need support in packaging. Our project 'Facilitation of SMIs in food sector through packaging' helps them to upgrade promotions and marketing. Our research has shown that MSMEs need support to enhance their packaging and marketing.
This project will also take place in all districts and five companies from each district will be selected. In 2017 and 2018, the Ministry had invested Rs. 240 million towards food and packaging development projects.
Sri Lankas food processing industry employs 1.5 million workforce directly and indirectly and reports around Rs. 100 million in its annual domestic production.

St. Peters College Bambalapitiya go out as underdogs in the 84th battle of the Saints cricket encounter against St Josephs College fought out for the Rev. Fr. Maurice Le Goc Challenge Trophy which will be played on March 2 and 3 at the P.Sara Oval.
This battle of the Saints encounter started in 1933 with George Jayaweera (father of former Sri Lankan national under 19 cricket captain cum Royal College 1970 and 1972 1st XI captain Asitha Jayaweera and former St.Peters College 1974 1st XI cricket captain Ruwan Jayaweera) leading the St.Peters College outfit in the first encounter. So far out of the 83 encounters that have been played, the Peterites have won on 10 occasions. According to the form book of the two teams St. Peters will be coming into this game with mixed fortunes as underdogs having recorded five outright wins against Gurukula Maha Vidyalaya, Richmond College, St.Servatius College, Dharmaraja College and St.Anthonys College and losing three matches outright.
They are led by all rounder cum Sri Lanka national under 19 player Santhush Gunathilake who is the son of former Thurstan College cricketer Sirosha Gunathilake, Shalith Fernando is the leading run-getter for the Peterites this season with nearly 750 runs while all rounder and left handed batsmen Ranmith Jayasena with a tally of over 700 runs will be the mainstay of the Peterite batting department.
The other top run scorers are skipper Santhush Gunathilake over 675 runs, Shannon Fernando close to 650 runs, Sulakshana Fernando nearly 500 runs, Sachin Silva close to 350 runs and Prabasara Herath over 300 runs, they will be expected to make their contributions to bolster the Peters scoreboard.
There is no shortage of amour in their bowling attack and they will be banking heavily on two bowlers left-arm spinner Mohammad Ameen Miflal their top wicket-taker with over 100 scalps and off-spinner Sachin Silva who has taken close to 70 wickets. They have plenty more in the bowling department with Santhush Gunathilake who has also taken nearly 25 scalps along with Ruwin Seneviratne close to 20 wickets and Shivan Perera and Tariq Saboor over 15 scalps each to give the senior duo the backing they need.
The Peterites will once again be coached by their 1998 captain who scored a breathtaking 159 in the big match and Sri Lanka national cricketer Malinda Warnapura. Warnapura guided them to a sensational double by winning both the big match and the limited over encounters convincingly under all-rounder Vinu Mohotty in 2016.
St.Peters has produced many national cricketers who have gone on to represent the country with distinction - Clive Inman was one of the finest left handed batsmen in schools in the 1950's who later went on to play English county cricket for Leicestershire, Dr. H.I.K. Fernando - once rated as Asias best wicket-keeper, David Heyn, Tony Opatha, Keerthi Gunaratne, former Sri Lanka vice captain Roy Dias, Rumesh Ratnayake, Vinothan John, Amal Silva, Russel Arnold, Kaushal Lokuarachchi, Malinda Warnapura and Angelo Perera to name a few. Incidentally Inman holds the all time batting record for the highest individual score of the series - 204 not out in 1954.
The outcome of the match will depend on which side will have the upper hand of scoring more runs in the first innings due to the 60 overs restriction.

Staff shortage at Dehiattakandiya base hospital
The Dehiattakandiya base hospital coming under the purview of the Eastern Provincial Council is receiving step motherly treatment from the Provincial Council despite the facility being upgraded as an A grade hospital in response to a request made to the President, alleged Ven. Morawaka Narada, Chief Adhikarana Sanghanayake Thera of the Mahaweli C zone.
The Thera said that the hospital had been facing a shortage of staff of all grades for the last five years. Although several other hospitals in Batticaloa, Kalmunai, Akkaraipattu, Samanthurai and Nintavu had excess staff, the Provincial Health Ministry had failed to transfer such excess staff to the Dehiattakandiya hospital despite repeated requests.
Presently, there is an urgent need to fill existing vacancies created by the retirement, transfer and death of nearly 30 staff members. Ven. Morawaka Narada Thera said a new dialysis unit and a drug store were opened at the hospital by Deputy Health Minister Faisal Cassim.
It is learnt that plans are afoot to build a five storeyed OPD building and an ICU unit at the hospital. This would create a need for atleast 80 additional staff for the hospital according to a senior hospital official. The hospital catered to nearly 200,000 residents in the Mahaweli C. Zone.
The Thera said he hoped that atleast the Eastern Province Governor would look into the shortcomings of the hospital since he had taken over the administrations of the Eastern Provincial Council which is now defunct.

STF, a well-trained outfit: PM
The Police Special Task Force launched by late Ravi Jayawardene on the lines of the Special Air Service Regiment of the UK has become an example to other police forces in Asia, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister made this observation addressing the 35th anniversary celebrations of the STF Training School and the passing out parade of its 74th intake held at Katukurunda, Kalutara, recently.
The Prime Minister said the new STF recruits should be proud of being part of a well-trained outfit and requested them to safeguard its honour and prestige at all times.
The Prime Minister added that the government had taken many steps to strengthen and develop the police service since 2015 by allocating the necessary funding and other requirements.
A section of the STF had been engaged with the UN peace keeping forces adding to its international glory and prestige, he said.
Today, a modernisation programme is underway in the police service including the changing of its archaic laws and regulations for which Sagala Ratnayake made a great contribution as former Minister of Law and Order Peace.
Tranquility is a common hope and aspiration of the people as it ensured stability. The provision of security to the people is a major responsibility of the government apart from providing education, health facilities and economic development, the Premier said.
These are the basic principles on which the government fashioned the country's future well-being. Since the country is now free of terrorism, the STF is being deployed for the maintenance of law and order and combating organised crime and narcotics.
The Prime Minister said that recently, a member of the Maha Sangha opined that the country today is facing a menace which was more serious than terrorism. When he inquired what it was, the thera said it was the narcotic drug menace. He said the drug menace which has spread in villages was a threat to the lives of the future generation and requested him to combat it.
A Catholic priest present on the occasion also approved this viewpoint. That was the reason the STF was also being deployed for a joint effort to combat drugs in collaboration with the Police, Armed Forces, Health Ministry, Education Ministry, Youth Affairs Ministry and several others institutions, the Prime Minister said.

Stokes steers England home in second New Zealand ODI
MOUNT MAUNGANUI,Wednesday: All-rounder Ben Stokes set aside his off-field troubles to steer England to a six-wicket win in the second one-day international against New Zealand on Wednesday.
The 26-year-old produced a man-of-the-match performance in just his second appearance for England since being sidelined over a nightclub incident five months ago. Stokes took two wickets for 42 then hit an unbeaten 63 as England easily chased down New Zealand's target of 224 at Mount Maunganui.
"It was good to get a bit of time out in the middle," he said after England levelled the five-match series 1-1.
"It's good to get out here and train and implement it in the games to make sure I was out there at the end. Hopefully it's a stepping stone for other games coming up."
Stokes only joined England this month after pleading not guilty in a British court to a charge of affray, with the controversy forcing him out of the Australian leg of their tour, including The Ashes. After England finished on 225 for four in reply to New Zealand's 223 all out, captain Eoin Morgan was full of praise for his star all-rounder.
"Ben's a big character, big in our changing room, he lifts everybody in the side when he performs like he did today," he said.
"It's great to see him back in fine form."
Trent Boult made early inroads as New Zealand tried to defend their modest total, dislodging Jason Roy for eight and Joe Root for nine.
Jonny Bairstow made a rapid-fire 37, then Morgan and Stokes dug in for an 88-run partnership that had England at 144 for three after 25 overs.
Morgan notched his first ODI 50 in 11 innings off 48 balls before departing on 62 before Stokes brought up 50 off 54 balls with a six edged over the keeper's head.
Earlier, Black Cap spinner Mitchell Santner scored his maiden limited overs half-century as the New Zealand tail to give the home team's score some respectability.
Santner's unbeaten 63 off 52 balls was the highlight of New Zealand's innings, with in-form opener Martin Guptill also scoring 50.
But a superb fielding display from England saw New Zealand bowled out for 223 with two balls remaining.

Tearful adieu to Indias first female superstar
INDIA: Thousands of heartbroken fans lined the streets of Mumbai on Wednesday as India said farewell to Bollywood legend and India's first female superstar Sridevi Kapoor following her shock death from accidental drowning in a Dubai hotel bathtub aged just 54.
Some carried roses while others held photos of the late screen icon as they queued patiently to pay their final respects at a condolence service in the western Indian city.
It's a shock to believe that she is no more. We want to pay her one last visit today and thank her for all her wonderful performances, Nandini Rao, a 32-year-old teacher, told AFP.
Legends of Hindi cinema, including actresses Aishwarya Rai and Kajol, were among the mourners at the Celebration Sports Club in the Andheri West area of Mumbai -- the home of the Bollywood film industry.
Heavy security lined the streets to control the crowds, which included people who had travelled hundreds of kilometres to be there.
Several fans chanted prayers as Sridevi's body was brought the short distance from her home to the club at 9:00 am. I'm an avid Sridevi fan. I loved her smiling personality. She had such a commanding presence in the Indian film industry. Her death was so sudden and I feel terrible, 45-year-old Kuldeep Singh told AFP.
Sridevi's body is due to leave the ground at 2:00 pm to embark on its final journey. She will be cremated at a private Hindu ceremony later on Wednesday.
Sridevi was considered to be one of the most influential Bollywood actresses of all time and her sudden death at the weekend sparked an outpouring of grief in India.
Tributes poured in from fans and fellow actors as well as Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The star of hit films such as Chandi and Mr India drowned in her bathtub after losing consciousness late Saturday in a hotel in Dubai, where she was attending a wedding.
Police in the emirate said a post-mortem examination found that she had drowned after losing consciousness. On Tuesday they ruled out any foul play and released the body to Sridevi's family.
It arrived back in Mumbai on a private jet on Tuesday evening, accompanied by her husband, the filmmaker Boney Kapoor, and her stepson, actor Arjun Kapoor. Sridevi, born Shree Amma Yanger Ayappan in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, appeared in around 300 films and was awarded the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian award, for services to the movie industry. She made her acting debut at the age of four and her career spanned more than four decades.
Sridevi worked in India's regional Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam-language films before making her Bollywood debut in 1979.
She became a national icon with a string of blockbuster films including Mawali (Scoundrel) and Tohfa (Gift).
Sridevi took a 15-year break from the silver screen after marrying Kapoor but returned in the 2012 hit comedy-drama English Vinglish. Her most recent film was last year's Mom. Sridevi was set to see Jhanvi, the eldest of her two daughters, make her Bollywood debut in a movie scheduled for release later this year.

Tourism Ministry teams up with Tuk drivers

In an attempt to reign in Sri Lankas virtually unregulated tuk tuk industry, the Tourism Ministry is trying to create an accreditation for trained drivers.
On Thursday and Friday, about 100 drivers from the Colombo area went to workshops held by the Sri Lanka Tourist Three Wheeler Drivers Association, which is supported by the Tourism Ministry.
Most of the complaints we are receiving against tuk tuk drivers are related to high charges, and cheating, said Chief Inspector Prabath Vidanagama, the Officer in Charge of the Tourist Police Division.
But theres no regulatory mechanism in this field, he said. So we are organizing a team, especially in the Colombo area, to combat this.
Drivers went to seminars hosted at the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hospitality Management on topics like the history of Sri Lankan culture, interactions with police, basic language skills, and first aid.
Once we take them into our framework, then they are always with us, said Inspector Vidanagama. If they want to keep the accreditation, they must follow the regulations.
Vidanagama said the first 100 drivers will receive a sticker with a logo showing they are certified by the tourism ministry. The logo will be prominently displayed at Bandaranaike International Airport so tourists know to look for it.
Tuk tuks offer a very important service to tourists in Sri Lanka, said Tourism MinisterJohn A.E. Amaratunga, addressing the drivers on Thursday.This is a comprehensive measure by tourism authorities to address the problems in a sustainable way.

'Tutu' painting by Ben Enwonwu sells for $1.6 million

A famous painting that went missing for decades before turning up in a London apartment has sold for over $1.6 million (1,205,000). Often dubbed the "African Mona Lisa," Ben Enwonwu's "Tutu" smashed sale estimates at an auction in London on Wednesday.
One of a triptych of artworks created by Enwonwu during the aftermath of Nigeria's bloody civil war, "Tutu" disappeared shortly after being painted in 1974. Its whereabouts remained the subject of intense speculation for over 40 years before the portrait was discovered in a family home late last year.
Depicting the Ife princess Adetutu Ademiluyi (abbreviated as "Tutu"), the painting was subsequently authenticated and went under the hammer as part of Bonhams' "Africa Now" sale. The London auction house initially predicted a price tag of between 200,000 and 300,000 ($275,000 to $413,000), less than a quarter of the final bid.
According to Bonhams, "Tutu" was painted after Enwonwu encountered the princess walking in the Nigerian countryside. The artist created two other pictures of Ademiluyi, both of which remain missing.
The paintings grew in fame not only for their beauty but for the mystery surrounding their disappearance. The eventual discovery of "Tutu" is partly thanks to the efforts of Giles Peppiatt, Director of African art at Bonhams, who for years made it his mission to find them. People brought him a number of prints but they all transpired to be fakes. Then one day in December 2017, he finally found the real thing.
After receiving a tip, Peppiatt made a visit to a "modest" apartment in north London and discovered the painting had been hanging there for the last 30 years.
According to Bonhams, Peppiatt said: "I was absolutely staggered when I first saw the piece. The owners, who had inherited it, had no idea of its current value."
The family behind the discovery has chosen to remain anonymous. "On discovering the long-missing work," continued Peppiatt, "I felt a little like Howard Carter peering into Tutankhamen's tomb. When Carter was asked by Lord Carnarvon 'What can you see', Carter replied 'Wonderful things... Wonderful things.' And so it was for me on that dark December night."
"Tutu" was among 20 Enwonwu artworks made available at the Bonham's sale. His paintings "Negritude" and "The Female Form" sold for 100,000 ($138,000) and 110,000 ($151,000) respectively.

Wele Suda acquitted in drug trafficking case
The Colombo High Court yesterday acquitted and released Gampola Vidanage Samantha Kumara alias Wele Suda in a drug trafficking case, after perusing inconsistencies in the prosecutions evidence.
High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi made this order taking into consideration the discrepancies that arose during the prosecutions evidence regarding the quantity of heroin seized by police.
However, the order of this case would not be effective for the suspect as he was already on death row for a drug smuggling case at the Colombo High Court.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Wele Suda for possessing and trafficking of 6.07 grams of heroin in 2010.
It was revealed when the accused was arrested by Colombo Crimes Division (CCD), the seized quantity had been recorded as 83.4 grams of heroin. However, the quantity which was referred to the Governments Analyst had been recorded as 97.7 grams of heroin. It was further revealed during the prosecutions evidence that police has failed to send the production items to the Magistrates court even after the lapse of a month.
After perusing the inconsistencies in the evidence, the High Court decided to acquit and release the accused even without calling for defence evidence.
Wele Suda had been arrested by the CCD on May 27, 2010 in the Mount Lavinia area.
The Attorney General (AG) had indicted him under the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act No. 13 of 1984.
Presidents Counsel Nalin Ladduwahetty with Counsel Salika Gunawardena, Amila Palliyage, Thusitha Ranasinghe and Vajira Ranasinghe appeared for accused.

What Buddha pronounced 2,600 years ago, scientists discover only now
According to some latest reports from NASA, astrophysicists have, for the first time, discovered a population of planets beyond the Milky Way Galaxy. Researchers at the Oklahoma University in the US, have used an astronomical phenomenon called Microlensing, which helps to detect planets. Professors, who made the discovery, using a telescope in space, were so much overjoyed that they declared, We are very excited about this discovery. This is the first time anyone has discovered planets outside our galaxy, although planets are often discovered within our Milky Way.
Through the use of these high powered telescopes, located in orbit, scientists have been able to come up with some ideas on the formation of our own solar system including the presence of other planets.
As announced by the Professors, this may be the first time that planets have been discovered outside our galaxy by the present day scientists. Those planets they discovered, probably belong to another galaxy, since the universe is made up of billions of galaxies. While it may be true to state that no evidence of planets has been recorded before now in other galaxies, it is not quite correct to say that this is the first time anyone has discovered planets outside our galaxy.
Modern science
No doubt the modern science and the unbelievable discoveries of the great scientists of our time deserve all our highest praise and unequivocal respect. But at the same time, the well recorded history has convincingly revealed that the Teachings of the Buddha goes beyond the discoveries of modern science. Over 2,600 years ago, the Buddha spoke of life on other planets, and said there are thousands of suns, thousands of moons, thousands of continents (Anguttara Nikaya). The Buddha said, again, that there are many, many other galaxies with unaccountable number of planets having different forms of life akin to them, and that they are far apart from one another (Majjima Nikaya). Let us hope that modern astronomy will gradually disclose to the world the startling revelations the Buddha made 26 centuries ago with his wisdom (Panna/Pragna).
Different life forms
Commenting on the nature and composition of the universe, the Buddha explained that many forms of life exist in other parts of the universe, and that these forms of life are found in thirty-one planes within the universe, confined to three different spheres. Venerable Kirinde Sri Dhammananda Maha Thera, an erudite monk, with many publications on Buddhism to his credit explains as follows, the different life forms existing in the 31 planes.
Sensuous Sphere - (Kama Loka or the world of five senses)
 4 States of unhappiness or sub human realms: (life in hells, animal life, ghost-worlds and demon-worlds)  1 Human world.  6 Develokas or heavenly (celestial) realms.
Form World Sphere -  16 Rupalokas or Realms of Five-Material Forms. (Corresponding to the four levels of mental repose ( Jhana - Meditation)
Formless Worlds Sphere  4 Arupalokas or Formless Realms. (Corresponding to the four levels of mental vacancy (Samapatti)
The existence of these other-world systems is yet to be confirmed by modern science. However, modern scientists are now working with the hypothesis that there is a possibility of other forms of life existing on other planets. As a result of todays rapid scientific progress, we may soon find some living beings on other planets in the remotest parts of the galaxy system. Perhaps, we will find them subject to the same laws as ourselves. They might be physically quite different in both appearance, elements and chemical composition and exist in different dimensions. They might be far superior to us or they might be far inferior.

Women betrayed!
It has been over two weeks since the first ever Local Government Election with a female quota has been held. The gazette declaration establishing the councils however have hit a snag and it has now become clear that it would be delayed until March 20.
The main hurdle for this is the failure of the Elections Commission and the political parties to come up with a fair solution to implementing the 25 percent quota for women in all councils by law.
This begs the question of whether the quota has worked or has it caused more problems
The Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act No 16 of 2017 which brought in the 25 percent quota for women has been very clear on the fact that Local Government bodies in the country should fulfil the quota if they are to be established but it also leaves room for two exemptions which has created the current crisis.
The first exemption is that parties which win three seats or less are not bound to nominate women from their additional list. Further in the case of an overhang, the party which wins the extra seats does not get any bonus seats. This means that if women have not already won their wards through the first past the post system, the party with the highest number of seats (due to overhang) cannot nominate women from their additional list. Thus, the responsibility of fulfilling the quota falls to the party which wins the second highest number of seats. In the current context, the party which finds itself thus saddled with responsibility has expressed deep displeasure in finding themselves in such a situation.
Women betrayed
R.M. Premawathi (58) has worked for the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) in Bibile for the last 27 years. She has headed 71 societies since entering politics in 1991 including the partys district womens wing and attended 12-15 workshops on training women to become political leaders.
This year, she was asked to include her name in the nomination list for the Pradeshiya Sabha- she was told that her name would only be in the additional proportional representation (PR) list. She would not contest her electorate. Not surprisingly, her party lost the electorate but won two additional seats.
They have promised that one of the seats would be given to a woman, but I am not certain. I have the most experience and qualification for the seat, she said.
Premawathi is not the only female candidate now having to rely on their partys benevolence for a seat. The new system decreed that a minimum of 10 percent of women would contest the wards, whilst a minimum 50 percent of them would be put on the PR list.
Most parties had put up women to contest from weak wards and promised the majority that they would get a seat through the PR list if they won the ward.
This strategy to defeat the purpose of the quota has now backfired on many of the parties as they struggle to establish councils in the wake of not fulfilling the quota.
According to the Elections Commission, the number of women candidates elected to Local Government bodies has been increased to 595. Prior to 2018, there were only 86 women in local government, today, Deshapriya observed that through the FPP system alone, the increase has been over 10 percent.
Human Rights Activist, Shreen Saroor however noted that if the 25 percent quota was fully implemented, the increase would be between 1800-1900 women in local government.
In addition the overhang problem which is present in over 196 out of the 340 local government bodies; increasing the total number of members by 364 from 8,325 to 8,689 has made fulfilling the quota difficult.
Of this number, 10 Local councils have it the worst, with Deshapriya declaring that there was no way to bring in women to fulfil the quota in them.
Saroor however observed that the only way now would be to have more women selected through the PR list and all parties would have to collectively work out a way to bring in more women.
The fallacy that women cant win
Though the Elections Commission is still figuring out the total number of women who would go to councils, on the face of it, many female candidates this time have lost the wards they contested or canvassed in. This has led to many political parties opposing the quota and having more women in their fold.
More often than not, it is not the womens fault that they lost, explained Saroor.
Addressing a group of over 40 women gathered at the South Asia Partnership Sri Lanka (SAPSRI) in Rajagiriya recently, she asked women from both the South and North to explain their grievances and work out a way to move forward.
Niroshini Priyadharshika (43), a UNP candidate from Panama in the Eastern Province says that her party would have definitely won her ward if she had contested it, The man they put for my ward was not liked by many and he lost. Many said that if I had contested, the party would have won.
Priyadharshika had won much support in her village for her efforts in the Panama land struggle but her party asked that she contest from the additional list.
Soma Dissanayke, an entrepreneur running a successful business in Moneragala stood for the SLFP in the area and she too was put on the additional list, despite having popular support in the area.
In Puttalam, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) convinced Bisleah Bhutto (31) to run for office for the Puttalam Pradeshiya Sabha at the eleventh hour as the party simply struggled to fill the female quota in their nomination lists. The party had nominated her to an area where the party had little support- she lost.
We also had to face some men from my own party canvassing for the opposition party in the area, so that the people would not vote for women from their own party, explained Bhutto who had to face the additional cultural burden in the area.
Moreover, in the present crisis, many of her male colleagues have asked that the party not give additional seats to women, with some even threatening to resign if women are appointed to their council,
My colleague was pregnant when she campaigned for the party from Kalpitiya to Puttalam. The organiser who gave us his van to campaign now says that politics is no place for a woman. And that we should not ask for a seat, she added.
They used me; they did not train me for this. Every party did that, observed Bhutto.
Kulanthai Vadivel Jeyachandrika (42) alias Meena, who was chosen from the UNP to run for the Arayampathy Pradeshiya Sabha, similarly received very little party support after their initial encouragement to run. Having persevered on her own despite strong opposition, she lost her ward by 100 votes.
However, parties which made use of the female quota to their benefit have had strong women win their wards and support for their party.
Though the official numbers are still being calculated, sources from the ground show that the majority of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) women who contested for their seats have won. The SLPP also won a surprising majority in most areas of the country at the recently concluded election.
The SLPP looked at how they could use the new system the best possible way to leverage their power as a new party. Both the womens quota and the mixed system were used well. They got women from the grassroots to run and they got their men to support these women. This was a strategy they adopted- it was not about being progressive, its just being smart, noted Saroor.
Similarly, the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (TMVP) which mainly has its base in the East, decided to provide a 34 percent quota in their nomination list for women instead of the minimum of 25 percent.
As a result, their candidate Selvi Manohar (44) is today the Opposition Leader of the Batticaloa Municipal Council.
A poultry farmer by profession, this is the first time she has contested an election, I contested from the Manmunai North ward and had to face 15 other candidates who were all male. But I scored the second highest number of votes in my ward, she said.
She had joined the party in 2010 and had been working in the grassroots for some time before being chosen to contest, Most parties did not put the right women to contest, said Manohar.
Our leader realises that women can win given the right support, she said. Her party which won five seats at the Batticaloa MC has three men and two women.
In the upcountry, Central Provincial Councillor, Saraswathi Sivaguru from the National Union of Workers (NUW) had four women contest for local government bodies in Nuwara Eliya. All of them were voted in with one becoming the deputy mayor, pointed out Saroor.
Lalith Kulanayake (54), a UNP candidate and former member of a Pradeshiya Sabha in Panama won the second highest number of votes in the Ampara District. She achieved this feat despite other women claiming that they found it hard to win in an environment where men spent money on votes and alcohol.
If you are the candidate, you have to go forward and speak to the people, even if you go with a group of 50, you are the one who needs to speak. Some women allowed the men to speak on behalf of them, that does not work, she said.
We were always focusing on training women and building their capacity to contest. We did not think of the complications which would arise from the system and educating them on it and looking at which parties offer them the best deal, added Saroor.
Many of the female contestants who were pushed into the fray by the political parties today are bitter, one reason for this could be that they do not understand electoral system and were not educated in it,
We did all the hard work. Just because we were put on the list, it did not mean that we did not campaign. So I do not understand why they want to change the 25 percent quota. We need to be given a seat, said Komala Ilayathamby (52), an SLFP candidate who has been working for the party for the last 31 years.
She insisted that all bonus seats be given to women, not knowing that only 50 percent of the additional list comprised of women. She, similar to other women was simply told that if they won their ward, they would be given a bonus seat. They were not informed that it was up to the party hierarchy to decide on who would be given that seat, not even the Elections Commission can insist on that.
Womens Organisations had proposed that the additional list be prepared under a zebra (names of men and women alternated in the list) system or a zip (names in a set order) so that there is a transparent system under which women can be appointed but political parties had rejected these suggestions. Thus, the women now have to convince their own party organisers to give them space in local government.
The Elections Commission Chairman informed us, that they could not force political parties to implement the quota, said Womens Action for a Just Society Convenor, Padma Pushpakanthi; who is campaigning for the quota to be implemented across the board.
He asked us to appeal to the parties as protests will not help much, she added.
The female candidates working with her organisation however, are not too happy about simply staying put until the political parties throw them a bone.
The women were given extra seats, they did not take male seats, the quota created new seats. But now it looks as if the men will take that 25 percent too, said Saroor echoing the disappointment of other women.
The female quota in its pilot project has succeeded as well as failed depending on how it was used by the political parties concerned. The women point out that the technical snag with the overhang whilst needing to be amended at a future date should preferably not involve removing the quota altogether.
We cannot give up on the quota now. It has taken 20 years to get here. There are lessons to be learnt from this but that does not mean that it stops here, said Saroor.
The fight will go on until this 25 percent quota is ultimately implemented from Local Government to Parliament.
