Read and pick
For those who love to read books and discuss them with the friends or coworkers, October brings in good news. This is the National Reading Group Month, and its the perfect time to start or join a reading group.
Today is October 1, but not sure where to start
Take a stroll in the colonial grounds of the Mount Lavinia hotel.
Well, that is a dreamlike experience to a common man. Yet that dream will be materialised this month thanks to the meticulous efforts of Annasi and Kadalagotu team.
Captain Elmo Jayawardena had one primary objective when he founded and initiated the Annasi and Kadalagotu literary festival (AK LitFest): simply literature, simply local. With that slogan, the literary festival opened its doors to anyone interested in the arts.
Continuing to expand the borders of literature, the A&K (Annasi & Kadalagotu) Literary Festival will be back on October 21 at the iconic Mount Lavinia Hotel for the fourth consecutive year. Entrance for the full day festival is priced at only Rs. 100/- in keeping with the core objective of making literature available for all and aptly themed Simply Local, Simply Literature.
Born from the idea of providing a platform for anyone who loves literature and comes from all walks of life - since literature should be enjoyed in its own stride, even as you nibble upon slices ofAnnasi or Kadala in gotu over the past few years the A&K Lit Fest has brought together a variety of writers, poets, dramatists, musicians and artists in a range of panels that discuss writing, publishing, performing, travel, digital writing, and comics.
The panel discussions for this year, as in the past, promise to push the perimeters of literature by not confining to novel or poetry writing alone but explore the many other avenues in which ideas are expressed. The dialogues attempt to touch upon governance, writing in the digital era, science fiction, short films as well as an opportunity for debut writers.
Short Story Competition
A short story competition in all three language  English, Sinhala and Tamil - is being conducted parallel to the literary festival where writers can submit their pieces under the two age categories of 13-18 years and 18 years & above. Submissions can be made directly through the A&K Lit Fest website http://www.aklitfest.com/shortstory.php. The winners of the competition will be announced at the literary festival on October 21.
Creative Writing Workshops
Two creative writing workshops; for students and adults, will be held in the morning of the festival. Registration for these workshops is free. Since seating is limited, each workshop will only host 30 people. Registrations can be done through emailing Nishika on [emailprotected].
Book Launches
As done every year, the A&K Lit Fest will once again open its doors to writers who are looking for a space to launch their new books. The past years have seen these book launches help writers immensely as they provide them with an option to an otherwise expensive and tedious task of organizing a book launch. Those interested in launching their books at the A&K Lit Fest can contact Dhananath on [emailprotected] for more details.
The Mount Lavinia Hotel joins the festival as official venue partner, creating the ideal setting for literature to be enjoyed; seeped in its own history and picturesque beauty, with the Indian Ocean as the background.
Your only requirement is that orange-hued hundred-rupee note to settle the entrance ticket and be a noted participant of the event. And the rest was not what you could usually experience at the Mount Lavinia hotel another day.
The participants have the opportunity to browse local publications in all three languages: Sinhala, Tamil and English. The festival will also feature three attractive food outlets by the hotel with a variety of local food and beverages available at affordable rates. The food, of course, included kadala (chickpeas) served in gotu.
The festival will also provide provided grounds to book launches. The benefit of such a book launch is the opportunity to have their books launched in a historical place.
At the inaugural festival, Captain Elmo Jayawardane elaborated why he wanted to initiate a festival of this calibre.
Hundreds of prospective amateur writers pen or type their lines and pour their thoughts out to paper with humble expectations of getting published. That is the day-dream of anyone who loves to write. The reality is so very different. Most times it is a trudge from pillar to post with a dust-laden manuscript seeking that elusive door which seldom opens. Often the success rate is so low that the would be literati then admits defeat and becomes one more also wrote to add to the Dead Poets Society.
It is not the publishers fault. They run a business, it is not anybodys fault. It is just the way things are.
People love to write and they write and fail to publish and then they fade away discouraging the rest who are struggling to write.
So we need literary events. Places where pedestrian participation is given precedence. The stage must be for people who write. Not only from the top shelf, but from any rung in the ladder as long as they are writers and poets. That is the thought behind Annasi and Kadalagotu, Captain Jayawardane added.
The AK LitFest has focuses on giving the grassroots of Sri Lankan literature a platform to showcase their talents and also expose a wider Sri Lankan audience to the enchantment of literature.
AK is also about exposing as many as possible to the various different languages that compose Sri Lankan literature.

Recreating the lost garden
To find a masterpiece buried in the back garden, after it had been lost for a century, is the stuff of an Enid Blyton story. Yet that is exactly what happened to Rosamund Wallinger soon after she moved into The Manor House in the village of Upton Grey, near Basingstoke in Hampshire.
It was 1984 and Rosamund and her financier husband, John, had moved down from Paultons Square in Chelsea to start a new life in the sticks. The Manor cost less than 200,000 and was a good buy at the time, but the house was in a dreadful state, derelict and with many burst pipes.
The garden, which was overrun with weeds and brambles, had been neglected for decades. Rosamund, now 75, was no gardener, and she viewed the task of making that jungle presentable with some trepidation.
When she met Gilly Drummond, of the Hampshire Gardens Trust, she discovered that the gardens original design was by Gertrude Jekyll, one of the leading lights of the Arts and Crafts movement.
Born in 1843, she created more than 400 gardens across the world, and collaborated with Sir Edwin Lutyens, designing the landscapes around his famous houses.
Gilly also knew that Jekylls original drawings for The Manor House Garden could be found at the University of California at Berkeley. The seeds of an idea took root: Rosamund would recreate Jekylls garden exactly as it had been in its glory days.
This project came about mainly due to incredible good luck, says Rosamund. If the City had been doing better in the early Eighties wed have had more money and wouldnt have bought this house. And if its previous owners had been richer, theyd perhaps have put in a swimming pool and a tennis court, which would have made restoration work extremely difficult. As it was, there had been no damage done to it. It is true that the drystone walls had collapsed, but their Purbeck stones were still here, as were the shallow steps that are so typical of Jekyll. The garden was mendable.
In May 1984, copies of the 19 original plans for the garden, dated 1908 and 1909, arrived in Upton Grey from the University of California. Work immediately began on clearing incorrect trees and weeds, and digging out trenches for yew plants.
In the more formal gardens Rosamund sterilised and cleared soil before double digging and feeding it with manure. Plants and seeds, as prescribed by Jekyll, were ordered for delivery, as were all shrubs, roses and the yew plants for hedging. Sourcing this collection was surprisingly easy, as the great horticulturalist admired her plants more for their collective effect than their rarity or individual beauty.
Today you get the best view of the five acres of gardens from the slightly elevated terrace, from where a heavy oak pergola, hung with ships ropes, leads from the house down steps to the Rose Garden.
We have hardly made any headway into the garden before Rosamund is stopped and questioned by groups of visitors. At least 3,000 people pay to see the gardens in summer and each one gets a short lecture. Isnt this all quite a lot of hard work I find them very interesting and instructive, she says. They come mainly from overseas and some bring me presents.To me, creating this garden is like being an artist, and to be one you need to communicate. I dont think Id bother to do it if it werent for the visitors. Theres also something about nature that makes you want to share it with others.

Sabalenka clinches Wuhan Open
WUHAN 2018: A dominant Aryna Sabalenka thrashed Anett Kontaveit 6-3, 6-3 on Saturday to clinch the Wuhan Open in China, the biggest tournament win of her career.
The Belarusian cruised to her second WTA title, facing little trouble from Estonia's Kontaveit, who was unable to reproduce the sparkling tennis she played on her way to the final.
The 20th-ranked Sabalenka had often been unplayable this week in Wuhan with her mix of aggression, clever placement and a scorching serve, and left Kontaveit flat-footed several times as she raced to take the first set.
Kontaveit tried to fight back in the second set, matching Sabalenka game for game until 3-3 when her resistance was broken and the Belarusian took three games on the trot to win the title.
I try to be more calm on the court, not be aggressive with every shot, Sabalenka said after her win. I've started thinking more on the court. The Minsk-born Sabalenka is projected to climb to a career-best 16th after securing the Wuhan Open, a $2.7-million Premier 5 tournament which awards 900 ranking points to the winner.
Last month, the 20-year-old grabbed her first WTA title, winning the Connecticut Open, which is one category below the Premier 5 tournaments.
Her victory on Saturday not only made her the youngest Wuhan Open finalist and champion, but also the youngest player to win a Premier 5 tournament since Belinda Bencic won the 2015 Rogers Cup in Toronto at the age of 18.
Just too strong
Sabalenka, who was 111th in the world at this time last year, has rocketed up the rankings since and will now head to Beijing to compete in the China Open, hoping to continue her Wuhan Open form.
Kontaveit, whose impressive run to the final included a first-round upset of world number nine and 2017 US Open champion Sloane Stephens, found Sabalenka's power too much to handle. Her game was really aggressive and I felt the pressure straight away, said the 27th-ranked Kontaveit, who has said her aim is to finish in the top 20 at the end of the year.
She was just too strong today. The victory on Saturday also means Sabalenka still has a slim chance to qualify for the WTA Finals in Singapore next month.
Six out of eight spots at the annual tour finale are still up for grabs. Only world number one Simona Halep and Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber -- who both failed to impress in Wuhan -- have secured their places.
Qualification for the WTA Finals is one of the main targets for many players at this stage of the season, and nine of the world's top 10 played in the 2018 Wuhan Open as the frenzy for ranking points intensified. Earlier, Elise Mertens of Belgium and Demi Schuurs of the Netherlands beat Czech pair Andrea Hlavackova and Barbora Strycova 6-3, 6-3 to take the doubles title. - AFP

Sandalis plant nursery thrives with Thurunu Diriya loan
Starting a business and turning it into a successful venture is not an easy task. Every entrepreneur, small or big, has to face numerous obstacles including financial barriers.
The Enterprise Sri Lanka - Bank of Ceylon Thurunu Diriya loan scheme has given potential small-scale young entrepreneurs an opportunity to surmount financial barriers and reach their dream.
Sandali Kulathunga (24) who runs a plant nursery that bears her name  Sandali Plant Nursery  in Kimbissa, Dambulla, is one such Thurunu Diriya loan recipient.
Sandali is the middle child and the only daughter in a family of five. After finishing her Ordinary Level Examination at Weera Mohan Jayamaha Maha Vidyalaya, Dambulla, she followed the National Vocational Qualification Level 4 Certificate course in Plant Nursery Development at Inamaluwa Technical College and a course in Landscaping and Gardening at Matale District Vocational Training Centre, Dambulla.
With her qualifications, she started a plant nursery on four acres of her parents land, facing the Trincomalee - Dambulla main road, with the guidance of her father, who is currently working at the Agrarian Services Department.
Although she had four acres of land for her business venture, she was only able to run her nursery on a small scale due to economic difficulties. She came to know about the Thurunu Diriya loan scheme at the Technical College, where she followed the course in plant nursery development. She saw this loan scheme as a great opportunity to expand her business and applied for a loan.
Since she had all the requirements to receive the loan, she easily got through the loan application process and received the loan of Rs. 5 lakhs a few weeks ago. She used the loan to expand her plant nursery by buying a water pump to get water from the Dambulla Water Project and building a hut to house her plants and a small building for business purposes.
I could easily get through the process of getting this loan and SEDD was very supportive throughout this process. SEDD also conducted a two-day training programme to educate the entrepreneurs on how to conduct a business. This helped us to learn a lot of things that we did not know. She had praise for the Thurunu Diriya loan scheme and Small Enterprise Development Division (SEDD).
My future plan is to expand and develop my business by getting the maximum use of the four acres of land we own, she said.
The Bank of Ceylon in collaboration with the Policy Development Office (PDO) of the Prime Ministers Office, the Central Programme Management Unit (CPMU) of the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry and the Small Enterprises Development Division (SEDD) of the Youth Affairs, Project Management and Southern Development Ministry implemented the Thurunu Diriya loan scheme, which provides loans without a guarantor and collateral or with lenient guarantor conditions for young entrepreneurs who possess a degree or a recognised vocational certificate and who have been in business for not less than three years.
Further details of this loan scheme can be obtained from any branch of the Bank of Ceylon or from Divisional Secretariats islandwide.

Self-taught talent
Eighteen-year-old Angela Clayton adores historical fashion and costumery. Taking her love one step further she sews her own garments. The seamstress crafts long, flowing dresses fit for royalty and exquisite gowns that would make Cinderella the belle of the ball (without a Fairy Godmother).
Her projects take an incredible amount of skill, featuring complicated ruching, hand appliqu, and bodice forming. When each garment is complete, Clayton models her handiwork, taking on the look and attitude of the character who has inspired her.
With such complex patterning and construction, it might surprise you to learn that Clayton began sewing only three years ago. Originally, she was interested in creating things for cosplay, since it combined her love of creating, makeup, photography, and dressing up.
Since then, she has also translated her interest in history into garments that were worn many centuries ago, including the Renaissance and mid 1800s. Clayton is almost entirely self-taught. Thanks to the Internet as well as some trial and error, she dove into the hobby head first.
Despite her lack of formal instruction, shes not afraid to tackle the hard stuff.
If I want to create something, she writes, Ill do something regardless of how complicated it is.
This attitude will undoubtedly keep her learning and growing, leading her to her future goal of working in the costume industry.
Im not sure what job would suit me best, but I know I want to spend my life doing what I love, so it has to somehow involve sewing and dresses.

South Africa stutter before beating Zimbabwe
Kimberley, Sunday: South Africa had some anxious moments before beating Zimbabwe by five wickets in the first one-day international at the Diamond Oval on Sunday.
It looked like being an easy day for the hosts when Zimbabwe crashed to 117 all out, their lowest total in 39 one-day internationals between the two countries.
But South Africa also struggled on a pitch of variable and occasionally steep bounce, losing their first four wickets for 58 runs before a hard-hit 44 by wicketkeeper Heinrich Klaasen took them most of the way to the win.
It was a very indifferent wicket, said stand-in South African captain JP Duminy. There was always something in it for the bowlers. Even though we bowled well it was quite a tough total to chase down.
Opening bowler Lungi Ngidi took three for 19 to lead a potent South African bowling performance after Duminy sent Zimbabwe in to bat.
It was about keeping it simple, hitting your lengths and the wicket will do the rest, said Ngidi, who was named man of the match.
Duminys decision to bowl paid off almost immediately when Solomon Mire was caught at second slip off Ngidi without scoring. Although captain Hamilton Masakadza made 25 and Elton Chigumbura hit 27, Zimbabwe were unable to put together any substantial partnerships as the South African bowlers maintained control.
We were surprised how it played, said Masakadza. If we had scored another 50 or 60 runs we would have been more competitive.
Kagiso Rabada, Andile Phehlukwayo and leg-spinner took two wickets apiece to back up Ngidi.
Zimbabwe may have been unfortunate when Craig Ervine was the second batsman to fall, given out caught behind off Wiaan Mulder when replays suggested the ball may have missed his bat. No decision review system is in place in this low-profile series.
Tendai Chatara bowled an impressive opening spell, taking two for 12 in six overs to raise Zimbabwes hopes before Klaasen took charge. Klaasen hit 44 off 44 balls before he was fifth man out with 22 runs still needed.
Klaasen hit two successive sixes off left-arm spinner Wellington Masakadza before he was caught in the deep trying to hit a third.

Teaching the Literature of Mad Women
We narrate our lives in terms of timehow long something lasted, when something began or ended. In doing so, we downplay the importance of place and positionthe spaces where things occur, the spaces we are expected to fill, the spaces we are denied. The space of my life changes when I move to the Great Plains, for though Nebraska is wide and open, the margins of my life narrow, the walls of what is considered sane pressing in on me until I see myself as bulky, clumsy, on display. I spend more time in my new home, trapped in solipsistic contemplation of each pain and ache, space becoming so tiny I forget how good using the body can feel, forget the way I used to run or sprawl out. I am too busy trying to disappear.
When you are anxious you are confined to the space illness allows. The occupation is suffocating. Anxiety is compressed, dense, and claustrophobic, a million things packed in a tight mind. And it reduced even further on the Great Plains, the looming expanse pressing down on anxietys frantic nature until it reverberates. The first women settlers here went mad: lured by the promise of a lush utopia, they arrived to find isolation, barren earth whipped away by merciless wind.
Tornado eye
In The Bell Jar, Sylvia Plath describes the space of Esters depression as very still and empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo. If depression is the eye of a tornado, anxiety is where the storm tethers down, a fear funneling up and out for miles, growing wild and frenzied overhead.
Several years after I arrive in Nebraska, I teach The Bell Jar in a womens literature class for college juniors and seniors who are surprised to hear about the history of womens madness.
I designed this course around the long-standing notion that women are mad, I begin carefully on the first day, worried my students will know Ive planned the course because I have a personal interest in the subject, have had anxiety several years by now. I continue, Because a student last semester came to my office to talk about a paper and while doing so told me, All women are a little crazy, and I wanted to explore that common misconception.
Now, with a decade of teaching and anxiety under my waist-cinching belt, I recognize that I was not angry and afraid because of my madness. It was because of my gender.
(I dont say anything more about the student, that his fianc had recently left him and he called her that bitch and that slut when he talked with his classmates, or that he wrote war stories with all-male casts and enough explosives to blow up whatever was haunting him from his own military experience, or that he wrote opinion pieces for the universitys newspaper about the danger of feminism and why women shouldnt be allowed to wear leggings.
I didnt say that he stretched his legs wide in my office and said he rarely takes classes from women because theyre all a little crazy. Or that I chose silence, smiling because I knew what would happen if I did anything else.
Unexpected grade
Resist, talk back and face male anger, incredulity. Couch your opposition and face the same. Give an unexpected gradea D, a C, a B, the letter doesnt matterand be asked to explain yourself. Hear students say, Everything Is an Argument isnt a book titleits my ex-wife or The girls in my group were bossy, thats why I couldnt help. Overhear a student say, She wishes I raped her. Have male students shout at you, stand over you and point their fingers in your face, refuse to leave your office until the male professor next door intervenes. Have students write papers defending the multiple rape allegations against their fraternity house or about why the U.S. womens soccer team shouldnt be paid as much as the mens because womens muscles, like their brains, are smaller, or about how women wouldnt get raped so much if they would date nice guys. Have students write, I didnt really care about the course material, but shes hot on your course evaluations. The first class you taught The first assignment A student wrote a paper detailing why you should date him, then crossed his arms and argued at the back of the class for the rest of the semester when you ignored him. He took a class with you the following semester.
When the student looked me in the eye and said all women were crazy, I felt angry. Then the anger turned to fear. I blamed anxiety for making me too weak to prevent this, for being too afraid to react after it occurred. Anxiety, Id been told time and again, made me irrational and emotional. Its all in your head. Now, with a decade of teaching and anxiety under my waist-cinching belt, I recognize that I was not angry and afraid because of my madness. It was because of my gender.)
I watch students that semestermostly womenapplaud writers like Virginia Woolf, whose Angel in the House they compare to their mothers and grandmothers and times long before their own.
They are sympathetic to Pecola, the little black girl who descends into madness after being raped by her father and blamed by her town in Toni Morrisons The Bluest Eye.
They repeat, Your silence will not protect you, after Audre Lorde. They ask how they can Dive Into Wreck like Adrienne Rich. We read Jennifer Finney Boylan and other trans writers, and when we watch Boys Dont Cry and they learn Brandon Teena was murdered not far from our Nebraska city, they organize a campus film night.
They tackle complex texts, hold one another accountable. They are kind to themselves and other women.

Ideal solution for cholesterol
Three Soyfresh products to local market
Milk food, animal meat based food, chicken and other red meats are considered as food containing cholesterol. Intakes of such food directly supply cholesterol into the human body.
In addition the human liver also produces certain amount of cholesterol using saturated fat and transfat contained in the human food. Nevertheless high levels cholesterol in blood increase the risk of heart attacks and other complications in the human blood circulation system. High level of cholesterol falls under non contagious diseases and it has become a cause for people to suffer from cholesterol related complications. To combat above situation, H.E. Marketing has introduced Soyfresh a soya milk product into the local market. Soyfresh is produced in Malaysia using herbal soya cereals imported from Canada and marketed in more than 30 countries around the world and has won the confidence of cholesterol patients. Soyfresh contains ingredients successful in controlling cholesterol levels of patients showing high percentages of Lactose. Soyfersh stands high from other Soya milk products in the market due to its rich milky taste and it is free excessive Soya bean taste. It is available in strawberry and chocolate flavours.
HE Marketing has now introduced the three new soya products, protein plus, low sugar, and added calcium to the Sri Lankan market.
The selection of Soyfresh to serve in local star class hotels and in the outlets of Barista Coffee chain and the merging of Soyfresh as a natural herbal drink is a unique feature. Soyfresh provides the required protein amount to the body helping in maintaining an attractive slim body shape. As Soyfresh contain calcium and is free of fat it is an ideal drink for elders too. Particularly for elders suffering from calcium deficiency Soyfresh is an ideal supplementary drink.

Although the fare revision is made under the instructions of the Central Bank to institutions which did not revise charges even by 15 percent according to budget proposals relating to services produced by State institutions and their administrative costs, train fares had not come under revision for the last 3 years.
As such, the minimum charge of Rs.10 per third class, Rs. 20 per second class and Rs. 40 per first class will remain the same under the revision of fares.
Season ticket fares will also come under the revision, but the percentage charged will not change. Accordingly, the percentage of 9 times the single trip charge changed for public servants and the 24 times single trip changed for private sector season ticket will also remain the same.
The season ticket charges for school, university and pirivena students will be six times the normal fare of a single trip.
The rail fare revision is being made after 10 years but still train fares will remain lower than bus fares even after the bus fare revision.

World Habitat Day falls today
Waste no more!
The world habitat days was declared by the United Nations General Assembly in the year 1985. First Monday of October every year was dedicated as the World Habit Day. The theme this year is Municipal Solid Waste Management
What is solid waste Solid waste refers to a wide range of garbage created by human and animal activities discarded by as unwanted and useless. The main creators of solid waste are residential, industrial and commercial activists in the given municipal areas.
Warm and humid climate makes solid waste extremely putrid. The waste therefore has to be removed and disposed of quickly, efficiently, and safely before it gives rise to bad odour, infectious disease, and other public health hazards. The Ministry of Local Government should develop a comprehensive and reliable garbage-collection system for all municipal councils and the other local authority areas. A proper methodology has to be adopted to collect and dispose of garbage on daily basis to prevent problems associated with the decomposition of organic wastes.
Solid Waste Management
Daily hundreds of tons of solid waste is disposed within Municipal areas. These wastes come from homes, offices, industries and various other agricultural activities and market places. If these solid waste is not properly collected, it can pollute the surroundings and it can seriously affect the health of human, domestic pets and our environment. The sources of solid waste can be classified as follows.
* Residential  Garbage of the residences can be classified as food waste, plastics, paper, glass, leather, metal, garden waste, cardboards, batteries, old mattresses used oil cans, tires, electronic items and discarded bulk households items etc.
* Commercial  can be referred to hotels, markets, restaurants, stores and office buildings. Solid waste generated from these places are food waste, paper, carboard materials, glass, metal and other hazardous waste.
* Construction and demolition waste. This includes new construction sites, demolished sites, building renovation sites, road construction sites. Solid waste produced in these sites are waste building materials, broken concrete, wood, rubber, plastics, glass, wire and dirt.
* Municipal services; Solid waste generated by municipal services include dirt collected by street cleaning, landscaping, recreational areas, parks and beaches etc.
* Biomedical Institutions  Hospital, medical equipment and chemical manufacturing institutions. Hospitals produce syringes, bandages, used gloves, drugs, plastics, food waste and chemicals.
In all these cases proper and scientific disposal has to be done, else they will cause a huge health problem to the neighbours and to the environment.
Solid Waste Management can be considered as a multi-disciplinary effort associated with the control of its generation, storage, collection, transport/ transfer, processing and disposal of the solid waste materials to safeguard a range of issues like public health, environmental and esthetic value of the area.
In addition, solid waste management needs to include proper planning administration, financial and the legal functions.
The collection and disposal of Municipal Solid Waste has become a widely discussed issue among the public, local politicians, and planners, particularly in the urban areas. Haphazard disposal along the roadsides and other public places have led to a number of problems such as, environmental pollution, water contamination, and increase in epidemic diseases.
Dumping of waste materials
Dumping of waste materials in this manner make biodegradable materials to rot and decompose under unhygienic and uncontrolled conditions. After a few days of decomposition, the decomposed material emanates foul smell and become a breeding ground for different types of diseases causing insects and other infectious organisms.
This spoils the aesthetic value and the land values in the area. Solid waste from industries are a source of toxic metals and hazardous wastes and chemicals that may be injurious to human life and the soil.
This may affect or can alter the productivity of the soil in the particular area. Toxic chemical can seep in to the soil and pollute the ground water. Hence it is obvious that the financial viability of waste management systems are more complicated than that of a commercial enterprise.
The administrations of non-hazardous waste in urban areas is a bounden duty and the job of Local Government authorities. The Management and administration of hazardous waste material is the job of the generator subject to local and national laws and regulations prevailing in such areas.
Rapidly increasing urbanization and economic development is one reason to witness heaps of municipal solid waste. Most of the municipal councils still try to meet the challenge of preventing environmental degradation due to unsystematic solid-waste management.
Open burning of solid waste, becomes a health hazard that need to be addressed. Solid-waste management has become an important issue in all the municipal and other local authority areas of Sri Lanka. It needs to be resolved through an integrated community, private and industrial sector, with policy-based approach adapted by the Ministry of Local Government, with regard to all local authorities.
Provisions in the National Environmental Act and its amendments and special regulations made by the Minister of Environmental and Natural Resources especially refers to municipal solid waste.
Municipal Council Ordinance and by - laws relating to Solid Waste Management are enacted for the inspection, supervision, segregation, storage, collection, discharge, transportation, processing, treatment and disposal of solid waste generated in private and public places. There are public health inspectors in the divisions to take legal action against illegal dumping and other violations. We do not know to what extent the prosecutions have been carried out against the violators of the Law.
The primary objective of solid waste management should be to minimize and to eliminate the adverse impacts of waste material on human- health and the environment. If this objective is realized it will finally lead to economic development and a better quality of life of those who live in the said local authority areas. It is the responsibility of municipal councils to improve the environment for the good of the community. The improper management of solid waste gives rise to problems of health, sanitation, and environmental degradation.
The following are a few methods of solid waste management.
* Sanitary landfill - This is the most popular solid waste disposal method. Garbage is basically spread out in thin layers compressed and covered with soil.
* Incineration - This method involves burning of solid waste under high temperature until the wastes are turned in to ashes. The good side of this method is that it reduces the volume of waste drastically.
* Recycling  Identification of resources in the process of taking useful but discard items for the purpose of recycling.
* Composting  Only biodegradable materials are used in composting. Good quality environmentally friendly manure is formed from compost and can be used in agriculture.
A proper environmental regulatory frame work has to be in placed to maintain high standard of hygiene and measures to prevent and control air and water pollution, and to manage hazardous waste and municipal solid waste.
Municipal Councils need to balance environmental protection and economic development through collaborate relationship between the Central Environment Authority and the key economic development and promotional agencies within the municipal council area.
A systemized solid waste management is an integral part of environmental conservation that should be observed by the individual members of the community, corporate members and the municipalities. This will keep the environment clean and reduce health and settlement issues.
The Ministry of Local Government has to develop a comprehensive garbage collection system island-wide and train the municipal and local authority officials by providing them with adequate training and infrastructure facilities to finetune the present systems adopted by the Municipal Councils.

West Bromwich move to the top
LONDON: West Bromwich Albion moved to the top of English football's second-tier Championship table with a 3-2 win away to basement club Preston on Saturday.
Leeds United's 1-1 draw away to Yorkshire rivals Sheffield Wednesday and Middlesbrough's identical result at Hull on Saturday created an opening which the Baggies duly exploited by beating Preston.
Jay Rodriguez gave West Brom the lead early in the second half before Andrew Hughes's free-kick drew Preston level at Deepdale.
But a Ben Davis own-goal restored West Brom's lead in the 73rd minute.
Dwight Gayle's curling 25-yard free-kick put the Baggies 3-1 up before Alan Browne pulled a goal back for Preston late in stoppage time.
West Brom's win left them a point ahead of both Middlesbrough and Leeds.
Boro's Britt Assombalonga scored his fourth goal of the season only for hosts Hull to gain a point through Jarrod Bowen's penalty after Daniel Ayala fouled Chris Martin.
Elsewhere, Sheffield United came from behind to win 3-2 away to second-bottom Millwall.
The Blades Billy Sharp had a penalty, given for handball, saved by Lions goalkeeper Ben Amos.
But Sharp gave United the lead at the New Den when he headed in Kieron Freeman's cross before half time.
Jake Cooper equalised for the London club with a header and Millwall went ahead through Lee Gregory.
But two goals from David McGoldrick, the first a penalty, the second a stoppage-time winner, meant the Blades left south London with three points.

I walked out of the cinema going machines that walk. I couldnt believe it. That was pretty much it, that inspired me! he told Guinness officials.
The film didnt just inspire Denton to break a world record, it inspired his career - he was part of the team that brought BB-8 to life in Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens.

Wrungness in translation
Ursula Andkjr Olsen is one of Denmarks most important contemporary poets. A poets poet and a critics darling, she won the prestigious literary award Montanaprisen in 2013 for her 214-page poem Det 3. rtusindes hjerte (Third-Millennium Heart), from a judging committee who hailed Olsen as one of the wildest and sharpest intellects in Danish contemporary poetry.
In 2015 Olsens sequel to Third-Millennium Heart, a book-length mirror poem titled Udgende Fartj (Outgoing Vessel), received the Danish Critics Prize from a committee who described the poetic work as an eruption of anger and a philosophical manifesto, a wail and a hymn, an interrogation of metaphysics, a critique of our age, and a future utopia.
Voice and form
Last year, my translation of Third-Millennium Heart was co-published by Broken Dimanche Press and Action Books in the US. Continuing from where Third-Millennium Heart left off, Outgoing Vessel is written in the same voice and form, and with a similar structure: a series of poetic suites that all make up one large poem, with a ritualistic repetition of certain lines and images.
One literary critic noted in the Danish broadsheet Politiken that while Third-Millennium Heart was about grief and capitalism, Outgoing Vessel is about grief and science fiction. The grieving over multiple abortions, which gave Third-Millennium Heart its wild depth, is still there; however, in Outgoing Vessel, grief has become a hard orb, hidden far inside the speakers distant interior. In there, utopian hopes of change loom. When offered to translate Olsens poetry into English three years ago, I was both excited and terrified. In addition to experiments with puns, syntax, and neologisms, her work contained a multitude of subtle cultural, scientific, and mythological referencesand had largely been deemed untranslatable for these very reasons. As I launchedor rather fellinto translating Olsens poetry, I first discovered how difficult it was to render her use of voice.
Icy and cynical
The speaker in both collections is an ambiguous character: abusive yet a victim; fiercely emotional yet icy and cynical.
In order to find this narrative voice in translation, I picked ten poems from completely different partsor should I say temperamentsof Third-Millennium Heart and tried to find a sort of median tone. I went through at least fifteen drafts of those ten initial poems before finding a voice I was satisfied with.
Compared to Third-Millennium Heart, the pleasures and perils of translating Outgoing Vessel are exactly the same. For instance, I chose to transform and (mis)translate many of Third-Millennium Hearts capitalism-neologisms in order to make them more impactful (or just more fun) in English.
A neologism such as vksthund (direct translation: growth-dog) became a charging bulldog in my version, replacing growth with Wall Streets Charging Bull, an American symbol of aggressive financial optimism and prosperity. In another case, I seized an opportunity to translate matriarkatet (the matriarchy) to the matriarchate, which denotes matriarchy and connotes the (free) market as well as Mother Market, a concept/character introduced in the same poem.
Similar neologisms and opportunities for wordplay in translation populate the pages of Outgoing Vessel, excerpted in this issue of WLT.

The elderly must be protected like our children
Taking care of the elderly counts the same as protecting our children, because both childhood and old age are two important stages of life where assistance, love and protection are needed more than in any other stage of life.
This uniqueness found in children and the elderly is highlighted by the act of designating World Childrens Day and the International Day of Older Persons on the same day, by the United Nations.
Older people deserve equal respect and acknowledgement for their dedication and commitment to contributing to a world free from fear and free from want. A robust arrangement must exist to ensure our senior citizens are well protected and cared for and to make sure that their needs are addressed. Children need to be strengthened to move forward in achieving their goals without being overwhelmed by emerging challenges. Providing them with the best education, health care and other facilities has been the priority of this government in its efforts to brighten their future.
I believe that our collective endeavours will assure a secure world for both our children and our senior citizens.

China highly professional in project assistance
China has been prompt and highly professional in the selection of projects and disbursements of funds which Sri Lanka has found to be lengthy and time consuming in other multi-lateral and bi-lateral relationships, said Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama addressing an Economic Forum on the Belt and Road Initiative held in Chengdu, China last week.
As a result Sri Lanka was able to mobilise Chinese support in time, he said.
Dr Amunugama however said that most developing countries have increased their debt burden in relation to international multi-lateral and bi-lateral lenders. China has played a positive role in suggesting a conversion of debt to equity in many of the projects that were launched with Chinese assistance.
The future will therefore be more complex in the realization of investment for infrastructural development. While the World Bank, ADB and AIIB have enhanced their lending capacity many borrowers are inhibited by the debt ceilings imposed either by the IMF or by their own budgetary constraints.
Recent developments in the areas of trade and commerce, with the imposition of new tariffs and trade embargos, will finally affect the development effects of the poorer nations. I would like to suggest that we appoint a high level group of eminent persons to examine ways and means of overcoming their debt difficulties.
The Minister also said that Sri Lanka is strategically located in South Asia and is known as the Pearl of the Orient. President Xi Jinping at the inaugural meeting of the Belt and Road initiative was kind enough to say that Sri Lanka is not only the pearl of the orient but also the Pearl of the Belt and Road co-operation.

It is the duty of all local exporters to convert Lanka in to a export- oriented country to achieve the objective of prospering its economic growth, 99X Technology CEO Mano Sekaram urged addressing the 26th annual National Chamber of Exporters (NCE) Awards ceremony held in Colombo.
Sri Lankas Netherlands Ambassador Joanne Doornewaard was the Chief Guest. Over 50 Sri Lankan exporters of local products including agricultural, rubber, tea and spice and spices based products were felicitated at the ceremony.
Delivering the keynote address Guest of Honour Sekaram valued the service rendered by local exporters to prosper the economy and thanked the National Chamber of Exporters for their untiring support extending towards our exporters to market their exports.
Since Sri Lanka has no large domestic population such as India and China to drive the economic growth by domestic consumption, we have to increase our exports to convert Sri Lanka as an export oriented country, he said.
He also highlighted the invaluable service rendered by Sri Lankan exporters and said statistics revealed that Lanka would be able to reach a record foreign exchange target due to the tireless efforts of our exporters.
NCE, President Ramal Jayasinghe said the Lanka export sector should be developed to the maximum to achieve the expected goal and said the Chamber also actively participated and contributed to the development of the export sector. He said the problem Lankan business community faced was the impacts of the impending free trade agreements and other matters such as lack of skilled labourers and the affects of increased taxes imposed on Lankan export sector.
Senior Vice President NCE Ramya Weerakoon said their prime objective is to provide all award winners to gain national exposure among clients, prospective buyers and business partners both locally and internationally.
The Vice President also valued the bilateral relations between Sri Lankan and Netherlands that have existed with the mutual understanding between the two nations. She said this awards ceremony for exporters was inaugurated in 1992 and continued uninterruptedly for the last 26 years. She said such recognition of exporters will undoubtedly take their enterprises to greater heights .
Netherlands Ambassador Joanne Doornewaard also highlighted the longstanding trade relationship with Sri Lanka.

Govt ready for power challenge
Sri Lankas communication sector has hit top spot in the world and the country is capable achieving this feat in the power and energy sector as well, asserted State Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, Ajith P. Perera addressing the annual conference of the Organization of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka last week in Colombo.
Perera said Sri Lanka has made huge strides in renewable energy production and in the past two years itself through the Soorya Bala Sangramaya project have added 181 mw to the national grid which could be valued at US$ 200 million. This was through sola roof panels and solar parks put up in rural areas.
State Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, Ajith P. Perera
The Minister however cautioned that corruption had been a huge bane in the development of renewable energy in the country in the past. A few individuals with permits were commanding a monopoly in the sector, he said. The government with a very ambitious effort has been able to do away with that draconian permit system and for the first time in the history of the country tendered two 10 mw power plant projects. The Electricity Board used to purchase a unit of electricity from private suppliers at Rs 23.10 and from the first tender itself by creating competition the government was able to bring it down by 50 percent to Rs 12 per unit. He said they called tenders for 60, 1mw projects around the country and was capable to bring down the average solar power unit which stood at 23.10 to Rs 17.10. The government subsequently tendered another 90, 1mw projects and according to the latest tender the average cost of purchasing a unit of solar power has come down to Rs 15.40 a reduction of 40 percent. Similarly tenders were called for two 10 mw power projects where they were able to negotiate Rs 11.82 and 12.20 respectively for a solar power unit which is a 50 percent reduction. The minister said within a couple of months they would call tenders for a 70 mw wind power, 150 mw solar power and two 100 mw solar power plants in Siyambalanduwa and Pooneryn. Perera said the governments ultimate goal was to move to 100 percent renewable power production by 2050.
The Electricity Board plans to construct a 100 mw wind power plant in mannar and the cost of producing unit of electricity using wind power was $ 0.5 per unit. This is in contrast to Sri Lankas current electricity generating cost of US $ 0.8 per unit.
To achieve this, the power sector should be converted into a smart grid and the road map to the smart grid has been approved by the Cabinet last week and the process is expected to be completed within the next five years. The country will require 60 lakhs of smart meters and this would be produced by a local factory, he said. To coordinate these activities a control room has already being put up in Battaramulla with an investment of Rs 3 billion.

Govt should encourage  import of electric cars
In the wake of escalating fuel prices the government must look at bringing in more tax concessions and provide other facilities to encourage the import of electric cars, said Director at IMEX LINK (PVT) LTD, Kirilopona, Amara Wijegunasekara.
He said that around four years ago the tax on electric car imports were reduced but was removed two years ago. However the present Minister of Finance and Media, Mangala Samaraweera has reduced a duty on eclectic car imports to a certain extent. But this is not enough, he said.
Director at IMEX LINK, Amara Wijegunasekara
Wijegunasekara said that they were the pioneers in introducing the Electric vehicle Nissan Leaf to Sri Lanka in 2013 February and even to date keeps importing more electric cars. We import them direct from our joint venture company in Uk, ADB Global.
He said that today electric vehicles are preferred by all over the world and new R&D in to this segment has helped to create cars like Tesla Electric Car which could travel over 900 KM from one single charge. Benz, Renault, BMW, Jaguar and all other European, Korean and Japanese car manufacturing too are now producing high-end electric vehicles.
A recent study done by Loughborough University London shows that over 250, 000 new direct and indirect employment has been created since the introduction of the electric cars to UK and each year the country saves 51 billion pounds from fuel that would have gone to the use of petrol cars. He said that in Japan, Europe and UK government also provides special subsidies for people using electric cars.
He said that in addition to zero emissions the electric car also dont use engine oil as well.
Commenting on Sri Lanka he said that the infrastructure for electric charging points are now getting in to place. The latest is the two points at the Southern Expressway and also several hotels too have charging points for electric powered vehicles. The IOC fuel stations too would soon have charging points.
He said that in a bid to provide new electric cars to Sri Lanka, IMEX LINK (PVT) LTD will be introducing three new models to the Sri Lankan market soon. The Hyundai KONA would be a SUV that could drive for 480 Km in a single charge while Hyundai IONIQ and Renault ZOE too could be drive over 300 Km from single charge.
He also said that today due to the efficiency, new innovations and most importantly more miles from single charge electric vehicle are turning out to be the main car of the family and no longer the second car.
Solar powered car would be still been developed and it would take at least another decade before it becomes a reality.
He said that IMEX LINK (PVT) LTD, is also member of the Vehicle Importers Association and Eclectic Vehicle Club (EVC) which is working closely with the government.
We are also in the process of getting the approval to implement a successful method to dispose used electric car batteries efficiently so that Sri Lanka could import electric car batteries.

Our children have been freed from many economic and social ills
It is a popular saying that the film of childhood cannot be screened once again. Childhood, which enriches an individual with wisdom that could be used during the entire lifetime, is also the most cherished period of life in which a human being blossoms and is coloured with a shining golden hue.
As adults, it is a great opportunity bestowed upon us to peep into the world of children, which is vividly decorated with picturesque colours and divine tunes. It is my belief that International Childrens Day invites us to look at children with heartfelt emotions and fond memories of our childhood which cannot be relived and remains only in our memories.
We have been able to free our children from most of the economic and societal challenges which hindered us during our childhood. By providing education and health services to every rural village without any discrimination, we have been able to reach the satisfactory levels of social development similar to those of developed countries. Acting against child labour and ensuring every childs right to education, we have been able to ensure the fulfillment of the requirements of all international agreements and conventions.
However, there is one legacy of our childhood that is lost to the children of today. That is the freedom of childhood that we have enjoyed.
It is our responsibility and duty as adults to find out the ways to give back the childhood freedom and the vivid, coulourful abstract world which has been stolen from todays child due to highly competitive education, urbanisation and the transformation of lifestyles.
I am confident that the International Childrens Day programmes organised this year under the theme, March with courage, Provide strength to children will remind us of that responsibility.
While declaring my fullest commitment to the aim of the International Childrens Day to ensure a secure world for children, I wish the programmes organised to mark International Childrens Day every success.

Privileges we enjoy today obtained by our elders
A privilege of adulthood is the ability to perceive the world with the understanding of life filled with knowledge and experience and filter different perceptions with the wisdom gained over the years. According to Eastern philosophies, adulthood is the philosophical era of life. Thus, most philosophers and scientists established their finest approaches during their mature adulthood.
Moreover, we, with respect, must mention that all the rights and privileges we enjoy today as humans have been achieved for us by our elders.
I trust that such proud citizens are entitled to due respect and the theme of the International Elders Day, Lets celebrate the excellent senior citizens who won human rights for us, was chosen to bring back that discourse on stage.
I believe that a warm relationship could be built between the young and the adult by finding ways and means to harness the increasingly aging populations into the field of human progress and take steps to utilise their invaluable experiences gained over the years to enrich the efforts to increase productivity.

Scarcity of Glyphosate despite ban removal
Glyphosate is not available despite the removal of its ban, tea industry sources said.
Though the ban on Glyphosate is lifted for specific use in tea and rubber a plantation, the country is yet to receive the fist consignment. We do hope that this will be resolved by mind-October to avoid further issues with regard to exports in the future, said Chairman Planters Association Sunil Poboliyadde speaking at the AGM.
He said that they were made to understand that unless Glyphosate was made available to the growers in Sri Lanka, Japan might very soon lose the confidence they have with Sri Lanka tea and go into the other origins for their purchases.
The only alternative for Glyphosate MCPA is not accepted by Japan, he said.
He said the tea industry was in stable position after having suffered a prolonged period of four years with low prices. During the past year the prices improved to a record high level of Rs. 600 to 700 per kilo. Unfortunately, during the latter part of the last financial year, the prices started to decline again and now they stand at an overall average of Rs. 550.
There have been many seasons for the drop, starting with the issue with Russia where they detected the beetle inside a container.
We also have many trade issues especially with Turkey and some other export destinations with trade sanctions affecting the low grown leafy tea market.
Commenting on the workers he said that they were glad that the unions agreed for productivity based wage structure at the last revision and also to look at a revenue sharing model which needs to be aggressively pursued for the sustainability to the industry.
He said the production of rubber has shown a slight increase but it is way below compared to the production recorded five years ago. The natural rubber price is mostly governed by the price of Petroleum which has not changed much during the past year.




Rubber plantations are shrinking and the main cause for this decline has been the diminishing extents of rubber land, and also the climate change which has had an adverse impact in harvesting.
He also said that Palm Oil plantations too are facing an issue as the government encourages the sector and now they are discouraging it without proper research. The industry had imported seedlings worth Rs. 450 million in the nurseries but is unable to plant them out in the field due to a ban imposed by the government.
It has come to a crucial point where there is no solution but to put out these available plants with north-east monsoon rains. Otherwise, the companies would have no alternative but to discard the plants losing millions of rupees.
Among other critical issue is the ad hoc acquisition of plantation lands. Most lands lost in the plantation sector are the most high yielding and profitable lands with easy access. We are aware that land is required for housing etc but acquisition priority should be for bare land or lands with low productivity.
Meanwhile Chief Guest Minister of Labour Relations Ravindra Samaraweera said that as the industry faces challenges from the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the planters must take advantage of the opportunities that would come in the form of automation and digitization to improve productivity.
He however said that the industry will never be able to do away with the human element. He also appealed to the industry stake holders to look after the people who work on estates to ensure the highest standards of welfare in estates for the workers.

US-listed shares of Asias most valuable public company rose early on Thursday but then erased gains to end the day down 3 per cent. While Alibaba makes money from its core businesses, including online marketplaces Tmall and Taobao and payment platform Alipay, it also has far-flung investments in sports content, microchips and facial recognition technology.
As Alibaba continues to invest in New Retail initiatives, the consolidation of lower margin businesses such as Cainiao, Ele.me, and Lazada is shifting the long-term margin profile of the core business, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note.
We expect managements ongoing focus on New Retail market share will continue to be a profitability headwind for the foreseeable future, said Sebastian, cutting his price target on the stock by US$5 to US$215.
In April-June, Alibabas gross margin was 11 per cent versus 29.2 per cent a year earlier, the lowest since the companys 2014 stock exchange listing. Profit margins at Alibaba are typically well above 20 per cent.
On Thursday, the company said it had formed a holding company for its food delivery platform Ele.me and food and lifestyle services firm Koubei, for which it had received over US$3 billion in new investment commitments, including from SoftBank Group Corp and Alibaba itself.
Quarterly net profit at Alibaba, led by Chinas second-richest man Jack Ma, plunged 41 per cent, hurt by a one-time charge for stock-based compensation paid to employees to account for a jump in valuation of its affiliate Ant Financial.
Without the charge, Alibaba said its net income would have risen by 33 per cent from the year-ago period. Excluding one-off items, the company earned 8.04 yuan per share, or US$1.22 per share, missing the average estimate of 8.15 yuan per share. Channel NewsAsia

TRIBUTE
Prof. M.T.A. Furkhan
A bold educationist
I have been a close associate of Prof. M.T.A. Furkhan from the time I joined the tutorial staff of Zahira College, Colombo; in May, 1972. When I was appointed the Vice Principal of that institution in 1984, we grew closer as friends.
We both worked at the Dr. A.M.A. Azeez Foundation after he was elected President of the foundation and I was elected Secretary at an annual general meeting held in 1994. We worked there until 2007 and are still members of it.
When Zahira faced problems between 1984 and 1987, I worked closely with the Board of Governors (BOG), especially with Prof. Furkhan. I can still remember how Prof. Furkhan, as the BOG Chairman, decided to close the college for two and a half months, and I feel that it was a wise choice. He is a bold, courageous and straightforward individual.
Prof. Furkhan was born in Balapitiya and received his primary education at Siddhartha College. He was later admitted to Zahira College, Colombo; in September, 1946. That was during Dr. T.B. Jayahs time, two years before A.M.A. Azeez assumed duties as Principal. Prof. Furkhan was boarded at the college hostel when Abdul Cader Issadeen was the warden. He received the N.H.M. Abdul Cader Memorial Prize for Islam (Junior) from the then Education Minister E.A. Nugawela in 1950. The professor was in the college boxing team and was also elected captain of the college wrestling team.
After completing his secondary education at Zahira, Prof. Furkhan joined the City of London College (now City University) and qualified as a company secretary and Chartered management accountant. He was elected CIMA President in Sri Lanka, as well as at the New South Wales branch in Australia. The professor was also awarded the CIMA Institute Plaque, CIMA Citation, the U.K. Institute of Chartered Secretaries Citation, and the CIMA Business Leader Award. He was the first Management Accounting Professor at the Sri Jayawardenepura University from 1973  1976. In 2017, he was the only Sri Lankan Management Accountant to be inducted to the Global Management Accounting Hall of Fame. Prof. Furkhan had rendered yeoman service to Zahira College while being part of its Old Boys Association (OBA). The college was taken over by the government on August 21, 1961; however, the OBA, with the support of the Maradana Mosque Committee, won the case against the government and took back the college on January 1, 1967.
Since May 20, 1982, Zahira College has been governed under the Board of Governors Act No. 18 of 1982. While the government ran the college, Prof. Furkhan was the OBA Secretary; and when the College was taken back, the Mosque Committee managed it. From 1969  1972 and again from 1983  1987, Prof. Furkhan was the President of the OBA.
The Maharagama Property Development Project was also initiated by Prof. Furkhan. After he submitted his proposal, the OBA received the BOGs approval to go ahead with the Project. Prof. Furkhan, M. Rizvi Rashad, M.L.A. Farook, M.T.A. Arif, A.S.M. Muzammil, M.M.A. Riza, Javid Yusuf and Saleem Hadjiyar were appointed to the OBA Sub-committee.
The plan to set up a college branch at Maharagama with 60 classrooms, a college hall, library, science laboratory, playground, and a hostel, was approved by the Maharagama Urban Council. However, its construction did not come to pass. Prof. Furkhan has also been the Zahira College Welfare Society President since 1998. When the Zahira College BOG (Incorporation) Act No. 18 of 1982 was passed, the following persons including Prof. Furkhan, constituted the BOG: Dr. M.C.M. Kaleel, MP Jabir A. Cader MP, retired Attorney-General A.C.M. Ameer, MP M.H.M. NainaMarikar, MP M.A. Bakeer Markar, A. Raheman Hathy, T. A. Jayah, Hussain Hashim, Rafi A Gaffoor, and Mohideen Cassim.
Prof. Furkhan has served the Zahira College BOG since May 20, 1982, except for the three years he served as the college principal. His name has gone down in the history of Zahira College as one of the founding members of the BOG. As a BOG member, he served in several committees such as the Buildings Committee, Maharagama International School Project Committee, Finance and Accounts Committee, and the Bambalapitiya Sagara Road Property Committee. He also served as a member of the College Educational Sub-Committee as well as the Heritage Committee. When the college celebrated its centenary, Prof. Furkhan was in the Dinner, Organising, Public Meetings, and Fundraising Committees. He was also the Patron of the OBA Centenary Executive Committee in 2014. I personally feel that Prof. Furkhan should continue to serve Zahira College as a member of the BOG, so that Zahira will have a good guide and pillar of strength.
The M.T.A. Furkhan Foundation established by the professor, provides financial assistance to underprivileged Muslim undergraduates. He also used his property in Balapitiyato to set up a community centre called the A.R.M. Thassim Centre in memory of his father. Prof. Furkhan is the founder of the Confifi Group of companies. At present, he is the Chairman of the Confifi Group and the Bairaha Group, and was also a leading personality in the hospitality trade when he was appointed President of the Tourist Hotels Association of Sri Lanka in 1990. The professor also received the Tourism Legend Award in 2008.
He was a member of the National Police Commission, National Finance Commission, Council of the Postgraduate Institute of Management, as well as the South Eastern University Council. Prof. Furkhan received the Deshabandu title in 1987 and the Deshamanya title in 2005 from former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
I cannot imagine Zahira College without Prof. Furkhan, and Zahirians will always remember the services he rendered in countless ways. They say that some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them. I believe Prof. Furkhan falls into the second category. The Muslim community and the nation benefitted from his services.
May Almighty Allah shower his blessings on him and his family.

D.Q.M. Sirimane
Man of integrity
Sri Lanka previously had two sets of lawyers: advocates and proctors.
The former were considered higher than the latter, although litigants sought the services of both. Advocates commanded higher fees and proctors only practiced civil law.
This ambiguous division was abolished later and all lawyers were called Attorneys-at-Law.
More relevant to this narrative was the fact that during the period under reference, the crown was represented by duly-appointed legal practitioners. In District Courts, they were called crown advocates and crown proctors. This particular story relates to a one-time crown proctor at the Balapitiya District Court, and Balapitiya has a long history of producing outstanding lawyers.
But here, our focus is on a lawyer who was from Bentota. He was D.Q.M. Sirimane. Between Bentota and Balapitiya is a village called Induruwa which decades ago, was thinly populated and verdant.
This writer had spent many a memorable school holiday in Induruwa at his maternal uncles residence. My uncle, W.A.C Sirisena, also happened to be a lawyer. He was a crown proctor in Balapitiya from 1956 to 1961 after beginning his legal practice in the 1940s.
His predecessors were leading figures. They were D.Q.M. Sirimanne and N. de Alwis. They were from reputed families in the Bentota-Elpitiya region. They were non-partisan in every respect and were of unquestionable integrity. One of the most notable facts about Quintus Sirimane was that he was the only proctor to reach the pinnacle of the judiciary: that of a Supreme Court Judge. He had joined the judiciary as a District Judge whilst in practice at Balapitiya.
It is perhaps relevant to mention that at the time of his elevation to the Supreme Court, his brother A.L.S Sirimane served as a judge of the Constitutional Court as well, which I believe was considered equivalent in rank to a Supreme Court Judge.
It was unusual if not unique for two brothers to serve in such high positions in the Judiciary simultaneously. Has there been a precedent in contemporary history Perhaps only in one such instance earlier. President J.R Jayawardenes father and his paternal uncle were both Supreme Court Judges. The Jayawardene family was pre-eminent in the legal profession of this country.
Quintus Sirimane had a son called Lal Sirimane, and he was a close friend of mine. A quiet and unassuming young man then, he was a Management Accountant who returned to the country after his studies in the UK.
He then joined a multinational company in the tobacco industry, which perhaps proved to be detrimental to him despite all other perks and fringe benefits the job afforded. It was Lal who related this astonishing tale of valour and independence demonstrated by his father against formidable odds. Lal never talked about his fathers distinguished legal career but for this episode and another, which were not known publicly.
At the time in question, the country had turned the political tides against the United National Party and returned the Sri Lanka Freedom Party to power. There was a powerful minister at the time who was close to the Prime Minister. The Minister attempted to influence judicial decisions in favour of his constituents, especially in election petitions heard before the Supreme Court. But Justice Sirimane had been ready when the minister walked into his chambers one morning for the purpose outlined above. He had asked the minister to leave the chamber at once.
Justice Sirimane had then sent a letter to the Prime Minister stating that he would resign from his post. However, the then Governor-General William Gopallawa had asked him to withdraw his resignation, assuring that he would take up the issue with the Prime Minister. If the resignation had been accepted and the matter became public, the implications would perhaps have been serious. People in the distant past were more conscious of their rights. The judiciary in a parliamentary democracy is one of its pillars, while the Supreme Court is the final court of justice.

Devoted family man
Ranjit Ella was my special buddy at Trinity. He was an unassuming guy who shunned the limelight, as well as a humble man and friend to all.
During our senior years, a few of us skieped school and spent most of our afternoons at a hideout we called Gustaff. Ranjit, I am sure you will see this from the beautiful place you are in and recollect the enjoyable times we had there and smile.
It was a haven where we shared our lunch, had siestas and engaged in debates, usually on minor matters, or simply gossiped and joked. Ranjit Ella contributed much to the bonhomie of the place; he possessed an unparalleled wit, coupled with the ability to deliver grounded advice. He was always ready to laugh.
Yet for all the life we had as boys and men, when the maker cometh, we have no choice but to leave. Ranjit my friend, there is deep sorrow in your parting so young, but also joy in the knowledge that you will achieve Nibbana far sooner than any one of us; your character and high values insured it from birth.
You were a fine man and husband to Sama, as well as a devoted father to Ayodhaya, Chulaka and Bahanuka. All of us, your friends, join to say a prayer for you; to wish you a wonderful and peaceful life in the hereafter.

Bangladesh must overcome mental block in finals: captain
Dhaka, Sunday: Bangladesh skipper Mashrafe Mortaza says his team must overcome a mental block in order to secure victory in crucial games after the Tigers lost their third international final this year.
The national side were praised for their spirited showing in the Asia Cup final on Friday against India, who clinched victory by three runs in a last-ball thriller. Replying to Bangladeshs modest 222, India gained victory only through a leg-bye off the final ball to secure their seventh Asia Cup title. The agonising loss was Bangladeshs third this year in a championship final. The Tigers lost to Sri Lanka in a tri-nation one-day international final in January before falling short against India in a Twenty20 tournament decider in March.
For some reason, it is not happening. If we can do it once, maybe it will be easier, Mortaza told reporters late Saturday upon returning from the Asia Cup venue in Dubai. Of course there is some mental block. Winning a tournament is important to overcome this hurdle.
Their next opportunity will come in October and November, when Bangladesh host Zimbabwe for three one-day internationals and two Test matches.
Mortaza said he was disappointed that Bangladesh had slipped again. But he urged his men to take the fighting spirit they showed in the Asia Cup final into their next fixtures.
There is no scope to say that we are happy after losing... we lacked many things, still we wanted to win it, he said.
But with the mentality the boys played, of course, it was outstanding. I will be disappointed if we dont see the same mentality or efforts in future. AFP

Celebrating children and elders
Today, we celebrate the Yin and Yang of Life: Children and Elders. It is the children of today who become the elders of tomorrow. On the International Day of Older Persons and International Childrens Day which fall today, we have to focus on issues affecting both segments. (Note that many countries now celebrate Childrens Day on November 20 to focus solely on children). But there is nothing wrong in celebrating these two facets of life together, as Sri Lanka does.
Almost 700 million people worldwide are now over the age of 60. By 2050, two billion people, over 20 per cent of the worlds population, will be 60 or older. The increase in the number of older people will be the greatest and the most rapid in the developing world, with Asia as the region with the largest number of older persons.
With this in mind, enhanced attention to the particular needs and challenges faced by many older people is clearly required. Just as important, however, is the essential contribution the majority of older men and women can continue to make to the functioning of society if adequate guarantees are in place. If our ambition is to, as the UN slogans say, Leave No One Behind and Build the Future We Want, the Nations of the World must address the population over 60 which is expected to reach 1.4 billion by 2030.
At the other end of the spectrum, there are nearly two billion children in the world (27% of world population). In 2050 there will still be an estimated two billion children, but they will be only 20% of world population as youth and elders take over. Many children the world over suffer from issues such as child labour, lack of educational opportunities, sexual and physical abuse, poverty, sickness, displacement as a result of climate change or conflict and malnutrition.
Here in Sri Lanka, the population above the age of 60 years was 2.5 million in 2012. Projections show that Sri Lanka would have an elderly population of about 3.6 million by 2021 and by 2041, one-quarter of the population would be elders. The total child population is estimated at 4.5 million. The Index of Aging, an indicator used to measure structural shift of the aged population in relation to child population, takes into account the number of aged persons of 60 years and above per 100 children under age 15. In 2015, there were 49 elderly persons per 100 children under age 15. This is more than a twofold increase from 19 in 1981.
From these statistics it is clear that we have to focus even more on the elderly population. Ageing is a global issue. Much of the global longevity revolution is down to falling infant death rates. People are simply living longer today thanks to medical advances (including artificial organs), better healthcare facilities, a generally better quality of life and effective support services for the elderly. In fact, scientists believe that the first person to live to 150 years has already been born somewhere in the world. With anti-ageing medicines, surgical implants of every kind and much better living conditions, it is not far off the mark.
Old people tend to have a worse quality of life in poor countries, but in a recent survey on where to grow old gracefully, Sri Lanka was placed 25th out of the 96 countries surveyed, which is the best in South Asia. Sri Lanka has scored very well in terms of three sub-indicators  social connectivity, safety and civic freedom. The Government pension scheme has been one reason for the relatively independent nature of many elderly persons.
The biggest obstacle for older people seems to be the lack of opportunities in many societies. With younger job seekers applying pressure from the bottom end of the employment ladder, there is often no gainful employment for the elderly once they retire from a formal job. If they have some sort of productive work, they can be more financially secure regardless of whether they have a pension or not. And with technology such as telecommuting, they need not report to an office for work, thus reducing any mobility problems. A recent German study found that, properly looked after, the old could be a boon to societies  a source of wisdom and experience in the workplace and elsewhere.
Most societies have been slow to embrace the positive aspects of longevity and to see older people as a resource. If that is accomplished, elderly people will have extended working careers as well as more self-reliant, healthy and independent living. Most people are able to work till 70 and should be given that chance, at least in vocations that do not demand excessive physical exertion.
Many countries, including Sri Lanka, have to grapple with the problem of a rapidly ageing population whose needs have to be met amidst various constraints. Science will only have some of the answers - Governments and societies have to find answers to the other questions posed by the rise of the silver generation.

Luxury apartment endangers citizens
Colombo has a novel skyline with high rise buildings. An apartment complex is built on the Baseline road by a leading construction company. The extent of land is 11.2 perches. It has seven floors and more than 12 housing units. One boundary is facing the Baseline Road and the side walls are facing the neighbours. The CMC approved plan to the land has the roadway through a side lane.
The contractor has obtained an entrance through the bus bay on the Baseline Road. One of the boundary walls has an opening extending to all floors. This opening on the boundary wall faces the entrance and gardens of two neighbours. Any solids, garbage fallen accidentally or thrown intentionally from such heights could be fatal. It also jeopardizes the privacy of the neighbours. This contradicts with the regulations of UDA, RDA, CMC and NWS& DB.
The RDA has already earmarked to further extend the Base Line Road by another four feet. The pillars and columns of the said construction fall in these lines.
The contractor has already, through the media, sold the property to possible buyers. When asked from the state institutions they said that this building contradicts all regulations. The proprietor of this construction company is a politically connected person.
As for the neighbours, the question arises how did the state officials authorize the construction of such a building What is the predicament of the unsuspecting buyers Would the state institutions UDA, RDA, CMC, NW & DB address the grievances of the affected and harassed neighbours

Del Potro savours 'amazing year' after injury hell
BEIJING: Juan Martin del Potro said Sunday he will go into this week's China Open enjoying the best moments of a career that came perilously close to being destroyed by injury.
The strapping but softly spoken 30-year-old is the favourite in Beijing with reigning champion and world number one Rafael Nadal out injured and Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer also absent.
The man fondly known as Delpo is ranked fourth in the world behind that trio and while there has never been any doubt about his ability, his career has been blighted by wrist injuries.
Del Potro, the 2009 US Open winner, was beaten by Djokovic in the final at Flushing Meadows in early September.
But that did nothing to dispel the notion that Del Potro is a man enjoying his tennis again having painstakingly rebuilt his career.
This could be one of the best seasons of my career, Del Potro, a popular figure in the locker room, said ahead of his assault on the China Open.
I won my first Masters 1000, at Indian Wells, I got my highest ranking ever this season (three) and another Grand Slam final after nine years.
It's an amazing year for me, but I also want to keep going because I like to pressurise myself, and I'm excited about that.
Looking deep within
Del Potro, who faces Spain's Albert Ramos-Vinolas in his Beijing opener, will head to the Shanghai Masters immediately after the China Open and is also chasing a spot at the season-ending ATP Finals. The Argentine, whose outsized 6ft 6in (1.98m) frame belies his gentle nature, is savouring being largely pain-free after multiple wrist surgeries.
He was unable to defend his US Open title in 2010 and reached a low point in 2015, playing just four ATP matches.
He has previously admitted that he was close to quitting tennis.
You have to find deep in your body the strength to be with the pain and injuries, Del Potro said of advice he would give to players struggling with injury.
He credits friends and others close to him for keeping him going in those dark days.
Now I'm here living the best moments ever of my career, he told reporters in Beijing.

## Title: Enable them, NOT dis-able!
## Supertitle: International Day of Older Persons and Children
## Section: Features

International Day of Older Persons and Children
Enable them, NOT dis-able!
The International Day of Older Persons has been observed on October 1 each year since 1991.
The focus of this years celebrations is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), as it turns 70 this year.
The 2018 themes main three goals are:
(i). To reflect on progress and challenges in ensuring full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by older persons;
(ii). To reaffirm the commitment to the same by States and
(iii). To engage broad audiences across the world and to mobilize people for human rights at all stages of life.
The Universal Children's Day marks the anniversary of the date that the UN General Assembly adopted both the declaration and the convention on children's rights - November 20 - but the day is celebrated on various dates in different countries  October 1 in Sri Lanka.
It seems that, as these two important international dates coincide here, most of the focus is on children perhaps the rights of the older persons do not get the recognition they deserve.
Inherent human rights  their significance
Human rights are indivisible, inter-dependent, universally agreed set of essential standards guaranteed to everyone automatically at birth without discrimination.
Full enjoyment of Rights is indispensable for seniors and children for four (4) main reasons.
(a). To provide protection from other people who might want to harm, hurt, oppress or marginalise us; (b). To protect our inherent dignity and basic humanity; (c). To enable our participation in daily life as equal members of society and (d). To empower us to live with equality, freedom, justice and peace.
Freedom from discrimination and the right to equality regardless of the varying degree of ability in day-to-day life are two of the vital basic human rights.
As life is about access to what we need day-to-day, it is fundamental to living and a prerequisite to enjoy most other rights  right to education, right to safety of life, recreation and employment included.
Hence, States have a legal obligation and moral duty to take steps to enable everyone - seniors and children in particular  truly to enjoy the rights and fundamental freedom provided by the International Conventions such as UNs Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (CRPD).
CRPD, which Sri Lanka ratified on February 8th, 2016  where Accessibility under article 9 is one of the 8 key pillars - is a legally binding agreement with comprehensive protection of the rights of persons with disabilities, and requires a commitment by each ratifying State for its implementation.
More important than pomp and pageantry
Time is pertinent to truly assess to what extent the expected and agreed RIGHTS of the two largest and important sectors of our population - Elders and Children, the life-giving spinal cord of our nation  are able to enjoy in the real world
Large and increasing numbers of persons in Sri Lanka, estimated at not fewer than 20% of the population, experience impediments to physical mobility.
These include seniors and those affected by numerous debilitating medical conditions, victims of accidents and the war.
In fact any one could become at any time mobility limited!
We wonder how many of our top key decision makers have realised and to what extent that the children and adolescent, due to their care-free life along with seniors, for different reasons, are the most prone at any moment in life, either for a short time or for a long time, to cause impediments to debilitate them
Rampant violations of rights in built environments
Sri Lanka enacted the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act No: 28 of 1996.
Clause 23(2) of this ACT stipulates: No person on the ground of Disability, [shall] be subjected to any Restriction with Regard to Access to or use of any building or place which any other member of the public has access to or in entitled to use.
The Ministry of Social Services has promulgated a comprehensive set of regulations approved by the Parliament  Ref: Gazette No: 1,4657/15 dated October 17, 2006. These have been further enhanced by a land mark Supreme Court order under SCFR 221/2009 on April 27, 2011. Over the past 12 years - in promoting the interests of seniors and children in particular - the Social Services Ministry and several of us have made valiant renewed efforts to implement and enforce these regulations properly.
Regretfully, the regulatory authorities have continuously failed  whether negligently or wilfully - to ensure compliance in full, BEFORE issuing Certificates of Conformity.
The Construction companies circumvent the Court Order and obtain Certificate-of-Conformity, in the absence of due Compliance.
As a result, key-parts of NEW Buildings, especially Toilets and Wash Facilities, Steps and Railings, Signage, Ramps and Entrances, fail to comply with specifications and requirements stipulated by the Laws.
The essential Buildings and Places recognised by the Laws include Hospitals, Hotels, places of Education and Higher Education, Supermarkets and Shopping complexes, ATM Machines, Sports Stadia and a large number of office buildings including those belonging to Ministries and Chief Ministers.
Turn letter of the Law into reality
If this escalating current state of non-compliance, IS NOT ARESTED NOW, when Sri Lanka is embarking on numerous Mega-development Projects, what is certain to happen
The next generations of seniors and children experiencing inevitable mobility impediments - numbers of whom will be much more than at present will be alienated from freely accessing and using the facilities therein at a wide range of New buildings and hence prevented from enjoying the next phase of Sri Lankas development.
If you remain inept and fail to bring constant pressure on decision makers, the world around would marginalise you and discriminate against you beyond expectations, perhaps for life.
As fate is no respecter of persons and positions, tomorrow will be too late for you and your loved ones.
Lack of equal physical access means denial of most rights and loss of productive opportunities. Physical obstacles to access send a message of unwelcome which is NOT good business thinking.
The quality of our life depends heavily on buildings and the built environment. Are they accommodating, safe and user-friendly Not yet!
How many children, adolescents and seniors continue to find access and safe use of the same facilities and opportunities their peers have in same society difficult
We often see children and seniors with badly twisted ankles, broken arms or wrists, back aches, vertigo or even arthritis and unable even to negotiate steps without excruciating pain.
Just think how it must feel constantly to be in that plight for a long time for any one of a hundred other causes  all due to poor design of parts of even NEW buildings which the public need to access and use in daily life.
Providing easier and safe modes of accessibility is a low cost feasible investment with rich dividends for all, enabling everyone to be more productive and more independent.
All places of Education, especially at all Universities and the mushrooming number of Institutes that offer internationally accepted degrees must be made by the State to respect the right to education of all children regardless of their varying mobility without discrimination through complying with Accessibility Laws and especially the Supreme Court order given on April 27, 2011
We are readier to offer sympathy and a helping hand, than empathy for empowering these people to enjoy even the basic rights with dignity.
Perhaps very many of you CAN take swift action whereas I can ONLY use words!
As many seniors, children and adolescents are STILL continually discriminated against and marginalised from so many daily needs and activities  economic, social and cultural  through no fault of their own but based on their state of disability then something is disastrously wrong, and to REMAIN VOCELESS - the world measure a civilised society by its inclusiveness towards all its citizens.
In this respect, Sri Lanka unfortunately still lags behind several other developing nations.

Equities hit a 5-year low
The Bourse ended the week on a negative note as the ASPI decreased by 42.72 points (or -0.72%) to close at 5,862.18 points, while the S&P SL20 Index also decreased by 14.76 points (or -0.49%) to close at 3,002.00 points.

Market capitalization meanwhile, decreased by 20.14% W-o-W (or LKR 20.14Bn) to LKR 2,752.86Bn cf. LKR 2,773.00Bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms)
The Diversified sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 40.81% (or LKR 0.68Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by JKH, Melstacorp & Softlogic Holdings which accounted for 95.69% of the sectors total turnover.
The Banks, Finance & Insurance sector meanwhile accounted for 28.42% (or LKR 0.47Bn) of the total turnover value, with turnover driven primarily by Sampath Bank & Commercial Bank which accounted for 65.66% of the sector turnover.
The Investment Trust sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 10.97% (or LKR 0.18Bn) to the market driven by Ceylon Guardian which accounted for 57.63% of the sector turnover.
Liquidity (in volume terms)
The Diversified sector dominated the market in terms of share volume, accounting for 20.56% (or 10.63Mn shares) of total volume, with a value contribution of LKR 0.68Bn.
The Banks, Finance & Insurance sector followed suit, adding 16.57% to total turnover volume as 8.57Mn shares were exchanged.
The sectors volume accounted for LKR 0.47Bn of total market turnover value. The Telecom sector meanwhile, contributed 4.76Mn shares (or 9.20%), amounting to LKR 0.06Bn.
Top gainers and losers
Adam Investments was the weeks highest price gainer; increasing 100.0% W-o-W from LKR0.10 to LKR0.20 while SMB Leasing [NV](+50.0% W-o-W), Tess Agro(+25.0% W-o-W) and Serendib Hotels[NV] (+25.0% W-o-W) were also amongst the top gainers.

In terms of volume, Softlogic Holdings & Dialog Axiata led foreign purchases while Ceylon Investment & JKH led foreign sales.
In terms of value, Softlogic Holdings & Melstacorp led foreign purchases while JKH & Sampath Bank led foreign sales.
Point of view
Negative investor sentiment continued to dominate Sri Lankan equity markets, and the ASPI ended the week on a negative note for the 3rd consecutive week.
On Tuesday, the ASPI hit a 5-year low of 5,833.58 (71 index point drop for the day) amid higher foreign selling on the back of worries regarding further rupee depreciation.
The LKR depreciated 3.8% against the USD in the last two weeks, bringing the YTD depreciation on the LKR to ~10.2%. Similar to most other EM/FM countries (which are facing higher currency depreciation in 2018 amid higher US rates), LKR pressure has partially stemmed from rising US rates and the USD.
So far this year, the US Fed has raised interest rate 3 times and indicated that a fourth hike in December is possible while 3 hikes are likely in 2019 and one more in 2020.
Although the Colombo bourse recovered on Wednesday (from Tuesdays LKR depreciation-led decline) by regaining 55 points, it failed to retain this positive momentum and the Index lost a further 25 points over Thursday and Friday to end the week ~38 points below the 5,900 mark (ie: 5862.18).
Meanwhile, despite Tuesdays higher foreign selling, the foreign equity sell-off on the bourse eased somewhat over the remainder of the week, with foreign investors recording a net outflow of just Rs.279Mn cf. Rs.743Mn last week.
Subsequently, the YTD foreign outflow on the Colombo bourse increased to Rs.6.1Bn (cf. Rs.5.9Bn).
The negative sentiment surrounding the LKR depreciation was also reflected in the weeks activity levels, and weekly turnover during the week declined 52% W-o-W to just Rs.1.7Bn cf. Rs.3.5Bn last week. Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from next weeks Central Banks decision on policy rates.
Inflation eases in Aug18 despite rising core prices
Headline inflation at the national level eased in August, in contrast to urban inflation levels which rose over the period to 5.9% Y-o-Y cf. 5.4% in Jul18 due to food inflation (7.5% Y-o-Y in Aug18 cf. 5.6% in Jul18).
The decline in inflation at the national level was largely driven by the reduction in food inflation (0.0% in Aug18 from 2.4% in Jul18) while non-food inflation rose to just 4.7% Y-o-Y in Aug18 relative to 4.3% Y-o-Y in Jul18.
The increase in non-food inflation was driven by higher i) transport costs, ii) health care, iii) housing, water, electricity, gas & other fuels, and iv) an increase in prices of alcoholic beverages & tobacco.
Upward price revisions to petrol and diesel in line with rising global crude oil prices led to an increase in transport costs while bus and taxi fares including three-wheelers were also revised upwards.
Moderating inflation levels (due to the easing of food prices compared to last years higher base prices) meanwhile led ADB to lower its inflation outlook for Sri Lanka to 4.5% (from 5.2%) in 2018 and 4.7% (from 5.0%) in 2019.
The ADB also noted that tightening Government consumption, stagnant fixed investments and lower net exports also warranted a downward revision in the countrys growth forecast to 3.8% in 2018 and 4.5% in 2019.
Meanwhile, greater import dollar demand led the LKR to hit an all-time low of 169.25 yesterday despite CBSL intervention.
The LKR has weakened ~5% against the USD during September and depreciated ~10% so far this year and the CBSL has reiterated that it will intervene during periods of excessive volatility.

First Aid comes to aid
A comprehensive First Aid Manual in Sinhala, Tamil and English developed by the St John Ambulance Sri Lanka was ceremonially launched at the Colombo International Book Fair (CIBF) at BMICH on September 25.
The Chief Medical Adviser, St John Ambulance in England and the Islands, Dr Margaret Austin graced the occasion as a special guest.
The occasion was also graced by other distinguished guests including the St John Ambulance Association and Brigade in Sri Lankas Batticaloa district president Al Haj A L M Meerasahibo.
Dr Kaushila Thilakasiri, a young doctor who is the DirectorTraining and Development, St John Ambulance Association and Brigade in Sri Lanka has coordinated and co-authored the manual with Dr Margaret Austin with the assistance of the honorary expert review committee.
The manual is done by adhering to the current European and UK Resuscitation Council guidelines and Advanced Trauma Life Support Course guidelines.
The objective of this practical manual is to instruct people of basic first aid skills and provide them with the knowledge needed to make a positive difference in the life of any ill or injured person who receives aid.
The manual discusses measures to be taken for common, mild, serious, and life threatening situations people may face, in a step-by-step-manner, using illustrations and photographs to help them understand the problem at hand. Speaking at the event Dr Margaret Austin said, the term First Treatment and National Aid has eventually become, First Aid.
Either directly or indirectly, every citizen is affected by injury or illness at some point. Hence it is important for all of us to be able to recognize emergency medical events having the basic knowledge and skills necessary to summon appropriate help and to provide basic care until that help arrives. My mother used to apply butter on burn injuries which is not done now. Now we do first aid the scientific way, she said.
Dr Margaret Austin currently is the chairman of the editorial board of the Tripartite Medical Committee developing the First Aid Manual which was awarded the Chairmans Special Award at the British Medical Associations Book Competition Awards Ceremony in 2009. She continues to update the manual for the purpose of First Aid teaching. She has helped edit the St John Sri Lanka with this new First Aid manual which will be the basis of all First Aid training. The manual will be sold to the general public for First Aid advice particularly in remote areas having limited availability to immediate healthcare.
Dr Kaushila Thilakasiri said in her career she has come across many patients and diseased people who would have benefitted and would have lived if they had proper first aid.
I hope that you will enjoy learning how to help those in need of emergency care and you will gain confidence in your knowledge and skills with the help of this manual. I recommend you to learn first aid and to refresh your skills on a regular basis. You can make a difference! said Dr Kaushila.
The first aid manual has been developed under the Social Enterprise Development Project of the St. John Ambulance.
International Division of the Order of St John provided the financial support for this publication. It is based on The Authorized Manual of St John Ambulance, St Andrews First Aid and the British Red Cross.
The First Aid Manual is designed and printed by M D Gunasena and Company.

Fitch Ratings Lanka Limited has assigned Serendib Finance Limited a National Long-Term Rating of A+(lka). The outlook is stable.
Serendibs rating is driven by Fitchs view that support would be forthcoming from its parent, Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC (CB). CBs credit profile and its ability to support Serendib is reflected in its AA(lka)/Stable rating, which is underpinned by its standalone strength.

Floods in Akurana
Akurana town and the adjoining area in the Kandy district were flooded following heavy rains on Saturday evening.
Akurana and a two-kilometre stretch towards Katugastota on the A9 road were totally submerged causing heavy damage to property as the Piga Oya started overflowing due to heavy rains.
A group of people in a bus which went under water were rescued by villagers near Akurana town.
According to police, around 50 vehicles were stranded in the floodwaters and the damage to property may run into millions of rupees.
Kandy Disaster Management Centre Assistant Director Indika Ranaweera said the floods were mainly due to unauthorised structures built near and across the Piga Oya.
He said due to this fact, if there is heavy rain, the Piga Oya starts overflowing and Akurana town gets flooded.
Ranaweera said this has happened on several previous occasions and added that authorities should take a decision about these unauthorised structures without delay.
The Meteorological Department says due to a low-level atmospheric disturbance in the vicinity of Sri Lanka, the prevailing wet weather is likely to continue during the next few days.

GANG RIVALRY CLAIMS INNOCENT LIFE
The Police believe that a 40-year old woman who was killed due to a shooting at Weligampitiya in Kandana yesterday was not the intended target.
The woman was shot dead while driving a car near Weligampitiya on the Negombo road by a shooter travelling in another car.
However, the Police believe the intended target was two suspected underworld members who were travelling in another car which was of the same brand and the colour to that was driven by the woman.
The woman had succumbed to serious injuries last afternoon after being admitted to the Ragama hospital. Kandana Police confirmed that a child had been present in the same vehicle in which this woman was shot. According to sources, the child was unhurt but in a state of shock.
According to Police, two persons who are suspects in several ongoing court cases related to murder and attempted murder were returning from the Peliyagoda Police station. The duo have been ordered by Courts to report to the Peliyagoda Police station and the Terrorism Investigation Division every Sunday due to their ongoing cases.
They had been returning in a white Honda-Fit car which was similar to that driven by the woman. Both cars had been travelling towards Negombo and were close to the Weligampitiya junction when the shooter travelling in another car opened fire.
The deceased has been identified as Warnakulasooriya Ann Rasika Royel, a resident of JaEla and the body is kept at the Ragama hospital for the post mortem.
The two suspected underworld gang members had later gone to the Jaela Police station to report the incident. The shooter is yet to be identified and the Police are conducting investigations.

Give Back Life to the marine environment
Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. (CCBSL) partnered with the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) to collect PET bottles for recycling, at the National Program of the International Coastal Clean-up Day at Daddala Beach in Galle. The event also included recycler Eco-Spindles Pvt Ltd. (BPPL Group) and volunteers from AIESEC partnering to demonstrate the positive impact of Harnessing the power of people towards an Ocean without Waste under the patronage and active involvement of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The initiative is part for The Coca-Cola Companys commitment towards help creating a World Without Waste. World Without Waste is the Coca-Cola Companys global goal to help collect and recycle the equivalent of 100 per cent of its packaging by 2030. This goal is the centrepiece of the companys new packaging vision in Sri Lanka as well. Through this, the Coca-Cola system in Sri Lanka intends not only to make packaging 100 per cent recyclable but also collect and recycle the equivalent of 100 per cent of its packaging in the country and work towards a cleaner and better environment.
Rear Admiral (Retd) Rohana Perera, Chairman of Marine Environment Protection Authority said, The risk of pollution of the ocean around Sri Lanka is increasing daily due to the influence of increased use of contaminants connected with development activities and increasing population. Large quantities of non-degradable waste get absorbed into coast and marine environments directly or through the waterways. The National Coastal and Marine Resources Conservation Week is proving to be highly effective in improving coastal and marine environments, while increasing public participation in marine conservation initiatives.
Country Public Affairs, Communications and Sustainability Manager, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Lakshan Madurasinghe said, The Give Back Life programs long-term vision is to work with host of strategic partners to deliver meaningful action towards a circular economy in which materials are used and reused to provide ongoing value. Following last years successful partnership of this same event, Coca-Cola is delighted to cement its association yet again in 2018. Most importantly, this national event is sending a clear reuse, reduce and recycle message to the citizens of the country. Our vision is to ensure that all our PET packaged material is recovered and recycled to minimize its environmental impact through the supporting of recycling programs and inspiring our consumers to recycle more, while creating livelihood opportunities for waste collection workers across Sri Lanka.
National Director  Partnership Development of AIESEC Sri Lanka Natasha Perera commented, AIESEC is delighted to take a proactive step in preserving our marine environment by partnering the International Coastal Clean-up Day. This event provided a unique opportunity for AIESEC volunteers to come together and give of their time and effort in cleaning our beaches while taking it upon themselves to spread the message of recycling. Sri Lanka is blessed with a wonderful marine and costal environment and it is in our interests, as youth and future leaders of the country, to ensure we preserve our environment.

Global IT Park, Minami Uonuma promotes Sri Lankan IT talents in Japan
Global IT Park Minami Uonuma initiated in 2016 with an aim to practice and promote open innovation between Japanese companies, Sri Lankan IT companies and other foreign IT companies. Adam Innovation came up with this concept through its global strategy consulting services for Japanese companies.
Japan is a very unique country. Compared to many other countries in the world Japan has deeply rooted business culture and extraordinary achievements. By the 1970s and 1980s, Japan extended its domination to the global electronics industry as it manufactured the majority of the worlds consumer electronics products. They introduced innovative and revolutionary new products such as the pocket transistor radio, the VHS recorder and the Sony Walkman, which created a totally new market that was similar to the Apple iPod and iPhone in recent years. Japanese electronics manufacturers also established a strategic foothold in the growing computer hardware industry, virtually Japans Bubble Economy: Nintendo monopolizing the market for semiconductor chips, circuit boards and other computer components  nearly everything except for CPU chip production, which was still dominated by American companies. In the 1980s, many people believed that the Japanese firms Sony and Hitachi would eventually acquire American electronics giants Intel and IBM, said President, Adam Innovations Co., Ltd, Kaushal Wawlagala.
In Japan, industries dominated by large business conglomerates keiretsu in Japanese. Typical keiretsu conglomerates were arranged in the form of a series of interlocking industrial corporations organized around a Japanese bank. There are also a large number of monozukuri companies who manufacture products and services for those keiretsu conglomerates. Monozukuri literally means production or making of things in Japanese. But, monozukuri is more than just crafting; it is a mindset, a spirit, a philosophy. It is the Japanese work ethic and the drive toward perfection, he said.
Due to this strong bond among Japanese companies, its really difficult for foreign companies to break this barrier. To have a business contract with a Japanese company is extremely difficult. I have seen many Sri Lankan companies are coming to Japan to start business with Japanese companies. They also initiate some good discussions. But, when it comes to business contracts it is almost impossible. That is one of the reasons we helped Sri Lankan IT companies to set up their Japan office in Global IT Park, he said.
Global IT Park is not just a business park to provide office space. It is a total support system for foreign IT companies. Even a Sri Lankan startup can start its office in Japan and be able to work with Japanese companies. We like to support startups because they approach problems differently, are constantly finding solutions, and are driven to make the most out of their time and work. Global IT Park has a good mix of startups and mature companies from Sri Lanka and India. We provide various support for them to get business in Japan. We conduct various business activities such as organizing regular business seminars and discussions with Japanese counterparts. We build partnerships with universities and business associations such as chambers and IT Associations. We conduct events and activities to build communication between Japanese and foreigners. We participate in major exhibitions too. Last year Global IT Park booth at Niigata Biz Expo got the highest number of B2B Meetings and number of visitors, he said.
Global IT Park is a very challenging project there are many things that we need to consider. There are language barriers and strong cultural barriers. More than that software development projects are not much visible to Japanese monozukuri companies as they are used to manufacturing hardware. Most companies do not have IT departments and top management do not understand the value of software. Therefore, the customer journey of closing a sale is long and time consuming. On the other hand, foreign companies expect quick wins. Thus, satisfying those two counterparts are extremely challenging. We utilize a lot of resources to create this harmony, he said.
Kaushal Wawlagala with executive delegation from Niigata Keizai Doyukai (Niigata Association of Corporate Executives), consists of top executives in Niigata companies
Last two years we spend a lot of time and money on PR activities as it is important to build awareness about technologies and foreign companies among Japanese companies. However, in last two years we were able to start a few amazing projects with Japanese companies and government entities. To name few, we developed a health monitoring application for Japanese construction and mining workers. We completed the phase one of the Ocular disease screening systems. We developed a multilingual restaurant App for foreigners to enjoy Japanese cuisine. We are in the process of developing a highly intelligent competency matching platform to match the skills and competencies for a particular project, Smart Parking Solutions, Foreigners registration system for City offices. Document Management system for large organizations, Smart toilet to monitor the health of senior citizens. Most of these projects are handled by Sri Lankan IT companies, he said.
We are very optimistic about the future of the Global IT Park. The government of Japan is to introduce a big stimulus package to motivate Japanese monozukuri companies to use new generation IT technologies. The Cabinet already passed the new Economic Policy Package to push up productivity through the use of technologies such as artificial intelligence, robots, IoT. This will help Sri Lankan IT companies to work hand in hand with Japanese companies to develop new generation technologies, he said.
Currently, there are six Sri Lankan IT companies registered at Global IT Park Japan. Those registered companies obtain the project and pass it to their Sri Lankan office for development. The management of those projects is done by the Japanese office together with Adam Innovations. This has high confidence and visibility for Japanese companies than directly passing a project to a foreign company, he said.
Sri Lanka has talented IT Engineers who can design and develop world-class solutions. We want to find good companies with a talented pool of such Engineers. This will help us to raise the bar of Sri Lanka in Japan and also to bring a lot of foreign revenue to Sri Lanka, he added.
Global IT Park in Japan is planning to showcase their new technologies in October Niigata Biz Expo and 2nd Anniversary events.

Government has safeguarded countrys image - Mangala
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that it was only this government that could safeguard the image of the country and protect Parliamentarians including Mahinda Rajapaksa from international allegations.
As a result of the measures taken by this government to build-up and maintain the image of the country, former President Rajapaksa is able to criticise the country internationally.
The Minister said so while participating in an event organised to establish UNP Pradeshiya Balamandala in the Matara electorate yesterday.
The event was held with the patronage of Education Minister and UNP General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam.
We have to get ready for an election. We have to face a few elections next year. That is why 2019 is equally important as 2015. We have to work with great dedication this time too, he added.
Minister Sanaraweera added that anyone can remember where the country was in December 2014. The country was just a stain of blood on the world map since it faced many allegations over human rights violations. The international community had been ready to conduct a probe even without our support. Because of the measures taken by this government, international organisations have placed their trust in us. If not for those measures, Rajapaksa would be tried by international courts, he said.
During Rajapkasa regime, the country lost the GSP Plus benefit and there was a ban on fish exports. But this government could obtain not only the GSP Plus benefit but we manged to get the ban on fish exports lifted.
This government was even able to set a record by exporting the largest ever fish consignment after the lifting of the European Union ban, Minister Samaraweera said.
He added that the fuel price formula was introduced by the government aiming to ease burderns of the people. But, unfortunately fuel prices have been steadily increasing since 2015 in the world market. But,once there is a drop in fuel prices,the people will definitely be benefited.
Rajapaksa, who did not carry out the court order to bring down the price of fuel,is talking about the fuel price formula now, the Minister noted.
He added that it is needless to mention the activities of the Rajapaksa regime.
We never sold state properties. It was Rajapaksa who sold those state properties. A part of port city had been sold to China. According to the agreement, China has ownership of not only the land but also of the air space. Besides, if there was a natural disaster and damage caused to the land, we would have to pay compensation to China, Minister Samaraweera said.

Govt initiatives for FDI will create opportunities
The Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI) held its 57 Annual General Meeting (AGM) recently in Colombo. Raja Hewabowala, who had been the Chairman CNCI for the past year was re-elected Chairman for another term of one year.
Presenting the Chairmans Review, Hewabowala said that the post war era with a peaceful atmosphere after a three decades war, the infra-structural development programmes in the country, measures taken by the government to attract Foreign Direct Investors will hopefully create more opportunities in the areas of business both to start and improve. However, the CNCI believes that such opportunities alone do not suffice to make a good businessman without know how and the direction. This is an important era where the chamber involves in filling the gap.

He pointed out that during the period under review, there have also been instances where the Sri Lankan industries have happened to face challenges. Global threats, natural disasters, labour issues, environmental issues, social and political issues coupled with competition have been among a bundle of challenges. The monetary an fiscal policy of the Government also created novel experiences to the local industries amid all these challenges.
He further said that the proposed Free trade Agreement (FTA) between Sri Lanka and China, ETCA with India and the already signed FTA with Singapore were significant factors to be concerned by the industrial sector. The Latest is the Singapore Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement, where the association believed that there were certain adverse implications to the industrial sector. We submitted the industrial concerns to the Committee appointed by the President, he said.
Hewabowala added that as the pioneering chamber for industries in the country, their endeavour was to create a level playing field for the local industries which should be free of undue constraints.
Hewabowala is a graduate in Rubber and Polymer Chemistry at the University of Moratwua. After graduation, he joined the paint industry as an employee and later decided to achieve his future aspirations with great confidence. In 1979 he started a company named Silicone Coatings with the brand name of Nippolac with only three workers. After 33 yeas in the Industry, Silicone Coatings (pvt) Ltd entered into a strategic partnership with Nippon Paint, which became the Asias number one paint manufacturer by 2012 . Hewabowala is also the Managing Director of Can-tec Printing and Packing (Pvt) Ltd, Speciality Construction Chemicals (Pvt) Ltd and Resin and polymer Technologies (Pvt) Ltd.

Hamilton wins in Russia to extend lead in title race
Sochi, Sunday: Lewis Hamilton increased his lead in this years drivers world championship to 50 points when he claimed an accomplished victory, aided by Mercedes team tactics, in Sundays Russian Grand Prix.
The defending four-time champion, who started second on the grid, was helped again by Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas, who allowed him to overtake and then defended him from attack by title rival Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari, as he battled to finish second.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who sat next to former F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone after a late arrival at the Sochi Autodrom, saw the Briton make the most of Mercedes strategy and a thrilling passing move on Vettel in what was an intriguing contest.
Bottas had started on pole and was unhappy at being asked to obey team orders that deprived him of a possible victory as he came home 2.5 seconds behind Hamilton, who looked sheepish about it all after the race.
Vettel finished third in the race and the German saw Hamilton extend his lead over him in the standings.
It was Hamiltons third win in Russia, his fifth in six races and the 70th of his career, confirming he has the momentum to clinch a fifth title triumph with five races remaining.
Kimi Raikkonen finished fourth for Ferrari ahead of Red Bulls Max Verstappen who marked his 21st birthday with a rousing drive, including a spell as race leader, from 19th on the grid.
Renault-bound Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo and Ferrari-bound Charles Leclerc of Sauber filled the next placings.
Kevin Magnussen finished eighth for Haas ahead of job-hunting Frenchman Esteban Ocon and his Force India team-mate Sergio Perez.
Mercedes team chief Toto Wolff left the luckless Bottas with no choice, but he tried to comfort the Finn afterwards.
Valtteri, this is Toto  a difficult day for you, difficult for us  lets get together and discuss it later, Wolff said. AFP

Hayleys Agriculture shares latest technology with A/Level teachers
In September 2018, at the request of the National Institute of Education, Hayleys Agriculture Training School, a training institution registered under the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC), imparted the best global practices of agriculture and the latest technologies to 60 A/Level Agriculture Science Teachers.
The training programme consisted of the following sessions: agricultural pest and disease management and chemistry; agricultural mechanization; agricultural irrigation systems and protected houses; drone technology; and electro-static spraying (ESS) technology.
The trainers from Hayleys Agriculture have received local and international training in the field of modern agriculture practices. These trainers, who have gained a wealth of experience by visiting overseas production facilities of world renowned R&D companies and witnessing best practices in crop management in sustainable commercial farming globally, shared their own experiences with the teachers.
The A/Level teachers who attended the programme from the Western and North Central Provinces not only received a theoretical knowledge of these technologies but were also able to touch and feel the products, and experience first-hand some of the innovative technologies that the company has introduced to Sri Lanka.
They were able to operate paddy transplanters, tractors, sprayers, combine harvesters and paddy threshers, tea harvesters, drones, drip irrigation systems and milking machines. Classroom training with audio visual aids showcasing world-renowned multinational companies such as Bayer Crop Science, DuPont, Syngenta and Kubota to name a few, were included in the training programme.
Hayleys Agriculture has a track record of over 50 years working closely with world-renowned companies involved in scientific research and has introduced the safest chemistries and new cutting edge technologies to the Sri Lankan farmer.
The company takes pride in divulging knowledge about best practices to the farmer to make agriculture more sustainable. Speaking to the media, Hayleys Agriculture Holdings Head of Human Resource Management, Vijitha Kumara said that the company has a large agriculture field force engaged in extension services for providing solutions to the farmer for crop health and optimum crop yields, and for educating the farmer on the importance to follow label instructions on safety with due consideration to the environment.
The prospect of reaching out to schools to encourage the next generation who would take on agriculture truly stimulates the enthusiasm of the trainers at Hayleys Agriculture.
We want the next generation to think positively towards engaging in agriculture. We want them to know that we can find the solutions to grow our food economically and efficiently while preserving the goodness of the crop, using best-in-class growing and harvesting practices. Involvement in agriculture should be seen as an exciting prospect holding promise for a better future and that is why we want agriculture education to make students believe that technology can positively transform agriculture in Sri Lanka to an exciting industry to be in, said Vijitha Kumara.
Approximately two million people or nearly one-fourth of the workforce, are still confined to the agriculture sector, which contributes just a mere seven percent to GDP.
The key problem of the Sri Lankan agriculture sector is that too many people within the agriculture sector produce too little. As a result, the income of the farmer continues to be low, thus constraining their bargaining power in the market.
Touching on this issue, Vijitha Kumara had this to offer, We have to keep pace with the rapid development in the agriculture sector in the world which is the only thing that would ensure the food security of Sri Lanka. Training programmes of this nature will ultimately transfer knowledge to the next generation of agriculturalists who would transform food production in Sri Lanka. The teachers who attended the training sessions said that the training programme was informative and will help them in encouraging students to make a career in agriculture.
This is what the country needs. We need to believe in agriculture at a time when rural youth are moving away from agriculture. We have to start from the school level, one of the teachers who attended the training session said.

Huge surge in Indonesia quake death toll
INDONESIA: The death toll from a powerful earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia leapt to over 1,000 yesterday, as stunned people on the stricken island of Sulawesi struggled to find food and water and looting spread.
The new toll announced by the national disaster agency was almost double the previous figure. Indonesian Vice-President Jusuf Kalla said the final number of dead could be in the thousands. It feels very tense, said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish baby boy at an evacuation centre in the gutted coastal city of Palu. Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies. Clean water is scarce. The minimarkets are looted everywhere. Indonesias Metro TV on Sunday broadcast footage from a coastal community in Donggala, close to the epicentre of the quake, where some waterfront homes appeared crushed but a resident said most people fled to higher ground after the quake struck.
When it shook really hard, we all ran up into the hills, a man identified as Iswan told Metro TV.
In Palu city on Sunday aid was trickling in, the Indonesian military had been deployed and search-and-rescue workers were doggedly combing the rubble for survivors -- looking for as many as 150 people at one upscale hotel alone.
There were also concerns over the whereabouts of hundreds of people who had been preparing for a beach festival when the 7.5-magnitude quake struck Friday, sparking a tsunami that ripped apart the citys coastline.
A Facebook page was created by worried relatives who posted pictures of still-missing family members in the hopes of finding them alive.
Amid the levelled trees, overturned cars, concertinaed homes and flotsam tossed up to 50 metres inland, survivors and rescuers struggled to come to grips with the scale of the disaster.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo travelled to the region to see the devastation for himself on Sunday.
On Saturday evening, residents fashioned makeshift bamboo shelters or slept out on dusty playing fields, fearing powerful aftershocks would topple damaged homes and bring yet more carnage.
Satellite imagery provided by regional relief teams showed the severe damage at some of the areas major sea ports, with large ships tossed on land, quays and bridges trashed and shipping containers thrown around.
Hospitals were overwhelmed by the influx of those injured, with many people being treated in the open air. There were widespread power blackouts.
We all panicked and ran out of the house when the quake hit, said Anser Bachmid, a 39-year-old Palu resident. People here need aid -- food, drink, clean water.
Dramatic video footage captured from the top floor of a parking ramp as the tsunami rolled in showed waves bringing down several buildings and inundating a large mosque. - AFP

Ronaldo is enjoying his football, he has integrated very well, said Allegri.
He's an extraordinary player, the passing is exceptional, and tonight was the best Ronaldo of the season, along with the high-level half-hour in Valencia. Ancelotti's first trip to his former club got off to a promising start when Jose Callejon volleyed for Dries Mertens to open the scoring after ten minutes.
But Ronaldo set up Mandzukic to head in the equaliser after 26 minutes.
The momentum then swung to Juventus with Ronaldo looking destined to score but the ball bounced off the left post and into the path of the onrushing Croat who tapped in the second four minutes after the break.
Napoli were a man down after Portuguese left-back Mario Rui was sent off after 58 minutes for a second bookable offence.
Napoli missed a chance to equalise when Arkadiusz Milik set up Callejon but the Spanish winger fired straight at Wojciech Szczesny.
But centre-back Leonardo Bonucci got the hosts third after 76 minutes when Ronaldo headed towards goal off a corner. Both teams are in Champions League action next week with Juventus hosting Swiss club Young Boys without Ronaldo who has a one-match ban after he was controversially sent off against Valencia.
Napoli play at home against last year's runners-up Liverpool.
Pellegrini revives Roma
Earlier Lorenzo Pellegrini came off the bench and lifted Roma to a 3-1 win over bitter city rivals Lazio to revive his side's stumbling start to the season. Eusebio Di Francesco's team had plunged into crisis after a 2-0 defeat to Bologna, but have now claimed consecutive wins for the first time this season after their 4-0 victory over Frosinone in midweek. The win ended Lazio's four-match winning streak in Serie A and lifts Di Francesco's side into fifth just behind their city rivals with 11 points from seven games.
We reacted as men today, which was what I had asked for, said Di Francesco.
This performance means the team hasn't lost its identity or idea of football. I saw the difference in their faces and their eyes today, and it showed on the pitch. Pellegrini came on after 35 minutes in place of Argentine Javier Pastore who hobbled off with a suspected calf injury.
And the 22-year-old transformed the must-win match in the Italian capital, opening the scoring just before half-time with a back-heel flick. Lazio ace Ciro Immobile missed a chance for the equaliser moments later, but made no mistake after 67 minutes with an angled drive following a howler by Roma's Argentine defender Federico Fazio.
But minutes later Aleksandar Kolarov fired Roma ahead again after Pellegrini won a free kick which the Serb sent through the Lazio wall, to achieve the rare exploit of scoring for both Roma and former team Lazio, in 2009.
Fazio made up for his earlier error with Roma's third goal, heading a Pellegrini free kick into the far top corner four minutes from time.
It hurts to lose a derby, said midfielder Marco Parolo, but we have to look ahead, this team has shown they are able to get up and start again. We are still ahead of them. Di Francesco's side take on Czech club Plzen in the Champions League on Tuesday.
Inter Milan look to move into the top three later Saturday when they play Cagliari in the San Siro.

Less tears more cheers for the Golden Years
Today, Monday October 1 is International Day of Older Persons. The aim of the annual celebrations to mark the event is about enabling and expanding the contributions of older people in their families, communities and societies at large.
Growing older does not diminish a persons inherent dignity and fundamental rights. The 2018 theme of the UN is Celebrating Older Human Rights Champions. What better way to celebrate this Day than by celebrating the older people around the world who dedicate their lives to championing human rights
Older human rights champions today were born around the time of the adoption of the UDHR in 1948. They are as diverse as the society in which they live: from older people advocating human rights at the grass roots and community level to high profile figures on the international stage. Everyone demands equal respect and acknowledgement for their dedication and commitment to contributing to a world free from fear and free from want.
Between 2017 and 2030, the target date for the Sustainable Development Goals, the number of older persons worldwide is set to increase by 58 per cent  from 970 million to more than 1.8 billion. By 2030, the number of people aged 60 and above will exceed that of young people aged 15 to 24.
After a lifetime of working, raising families and contributing to the success of this nation in countless other ways, senior citizens deserve to be treated with dignity. With people living and working longer, it is increasingly important that we appreciate the consequence of supporting senior citizens within our society.
The ageing process often brings about significant health, emotional, cognitive and social changes. Family members and caregivers should look to the principles of respect and consideration when dealing with the challenges which may accompany this process.
Yet even amid this frenzied rat race there are many young people who go out of their way to listen to the wisdom of the elderly or take a genuine interest in the stories the elderly may have to relate about the past. Remember they were young once too and many accomplished a great deal in their lives. One can learn from their wisdom the key to success.
As such, some of them could be considered more productive than their younger less experienced counterparts. Old is gold, claims the ancient hackneyed adage. But how old would one consider too old when it comes to hiring a golden oldster It might come as a surprise to many at what age employers consider people old. In many cases rejected job-seeker oldies are in their 50s and 60s and possibly 70s. Unfortunately in Sri Lanka as a general rule people become retirees around the ages of 55-60. Many of them are in their prime when they are relinquished to the geriatric paddock. Ability, experience, good health, temperament and an enterprising streak should be considered above all. Age in such cases is irrelevant. A good many oldsters are far more sprightly, dedicated and possess certain innovative qualities. Add to that vast years of experience and they are unmatchable candidates.
In fact, in many other countries they are asking retired people to think about going back to work in the capacity of their previous jobs to teach the green horns how to do their job. Its a great idea and one that will mesh both the young and old ideas to make for an almost perfect solution to any business problem. Although Sri Lankas intrinsic social values are fairly unique as far as most Asian cultures go, the care and treatment being meted out to a large segment of our greying population has become a worrying trend. Despite our inherent cultural heritage which subscribes to many religious attributes, such as filial devotion, the respect and care displayed towards the elderly have shown a shocking decline. Although all religious teachers talk about inherent social values, such concepts are fast eroding in Sri Lankan society.
True, a great many of these values such as filial devotion and strong family relationships still do exist among a fair section of the population. This is undoubtedly because of the ancient local traditions, where peoples lives centred mainly around religion and the family. But sadly, these values are eroding, largely because the younger generation chooses to identify with and involve themselves in the almighty rat race. In the rush towards personal economic success, people are forgetting the importance of all those attributes that are good and decent.
Why should our consumer-orientated, materialistic lifestyle make us lose focus of solid family values so that we, with unmitigated cruelty at times, relegate our parents to the limbo of the forgotten Many religious leaders have expressed grave concern that in this context a fair number of their devotees are no exception when faced by pressures caused by the race for material prosperity.
Several pathetic stories about neglected parents by their offspring have been brought to their attention. Besides acts of shocking neglect are the heart-rending tales of deceit, verbal abuse and even physical violence.
We see around us reprehensible acts of degrading torment for the family elders, who often give up the will to live. Yet often after the death of the victim whose last days on earth have been a living Hell, those same perpetrators make a show of public mourning and provide ostentatious almsgivings. Such pretentious sanctimonious acts is hard to comprehend.
Is economic success, all that important Does it have to take precedence over our own unique set of cultural and moral values, which the Western world views as perhaps ultra-conservative And do we as human beings have to resort to cruelty to the weak and ageing, when what is clearly needed are simple acts of kindness, generosity, thoughtfulness and compassion But what we see around us are many hypocrites who after profiting from parental inheritances - wealth and property at times signed under threats of shocking duress - being treated with appalling heartlessness.
No, we say, some things, such as strong extended family ties, are far more important than economic success and a better standard of living. If in our pursuit of profit and gain we lose sight of our duties and responsibilities towards our own elderly then it will be a sad day for all of us.
Clearly these middle-aged parents themselves guilty of neglect of their own parents should set an example to their own offspring in respecting their grandparents and the elders among the community. Rest assured that this will only remind them of their own vulnerability and mortality, where the Wheels of God could turn the same cycle. After all, money cant buy happiness nor could one put a value in monetary terms of parental care and love.

Rs.14.2 bn Treasury Bonds issued to SriLankan in 2010
LOSS TO NATIONAL CARRIER Rs.2.1 BN
The issuing of Treasury Bonds valued at Rs.14.2 billion to SriLankan Airlines in 2012 against Parliamentary and a Cabinet decision and breaching all regulations had caused a loss of Rs. 2.1 billion to the airline.
SriLankan Airlines Chief Finance Manager Yasantha Dissanayake disclosed this in his evidence before the Presidential Commission Investigating Alleged Fraud, Corruption and misuse of Public funds and assets in the SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering services and Mihin Lanka on September 28.
Cross-examined by Additional Solicitor General Neil Unamboowe PC, Yasantha Dissanayake said this exercise had caused an additional loss to the airline.
Additional Solicitor General Neil Unamboowe submitted the SriLankan Airlines annual reports for 2013-2014 and said this loss had been mentioned by SriLankan Airlines Chairman Nishantha Wickramasinghe in his message in the annual report and Yasantha Dissanayake accepted it.
Dissanayake said apart from the bonds issued in 2012, another stock of Treasury Bonds amounting to Rs. 12.6 billion had been issued to the airline in 2013.
These bonds totaling Rs. 14 billion had been issued in contravention of the Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance No. 7 of 1937.
He said these bonds had been issued on the initiative of then Treasury Secretary Dr. P.B. Jayasundera when Parliament and Cabinet had only sanctioned the issuing of Rs.500 million.

Municipal Councils and the Public Service
A friend, a retired accountant, owned a plot of land in the Dehiwela area with a long frontage to a major road. He had bought it thirty years ago as a residential property, but later, in view of the rapid transformation of the area, developed it into a shop/office complex. This was an investment he made with money saved during a lengthy assignment with an UN agency, overseas. Eventually, he intended to bequeath the property to his children.
However, sometime last year, my friend changed his mind and sold the land. In Rupee terms, he made a substantial profit. Despite his protestation that in terms of US Dollars, the gain has been modest, compared to what was paid in rupees in the late 1980s, the appreciation was impressive. This margin was undoubtedly the principal incentive to sell.
There were other reasons too. With the passing of time he found it increasingly difficult to manage the complex. His children had their own careers and took no interest in the running of the complex. Some of his tenants were routinely behind in their rental, defaulting on contractual payments, making it difficult for him to manage. With one tenant he had an on - going case in the District Courts, for his dues.
In addition, issues with the local government authorities, the Dehiwela Urban Council and sometimes with the Urban Development Authority, compounded his difficulties.
Like the title of that famous American movie - this is no country for old men. Every few weeks these authorities raise one issue or the other which require attendance at their office. When you turn up, nothing happens. Invariably the officer attending to the matter is not available, is too busy or the file cannot be located.
Rate payer left helpless
In more advanced countries there is a check list of requirements and if you are in compliance with this list there is nothing more to worry about. But here no one has a check list, as a result we dont know where we stand. Different people turn up with different issues. The common view is that they want a bribe, like vultures preying on the people. If you oil their palms the problem goes away for a while. I was not ready to do that. All my working days I tried to adhere to a basic standard in business matters. And of course, new taxes and levies keep appearing, the rate payer is left helpless. These things happen without any consultation or notice to the rate payer. It is unsettling to do business in this environment, you have to be ready to operate at that murky, uncertain level.
I have already distributed the money I got from the sale of the land to my children. But what gives me the greatest happiness is the knowledge that I dont have to go to the Dehiwela Urban Council anymore. Going to that place was a demeaning experience. It was as if an unprepossessing mob had taken over a public office, men with a low level of culture wielding power over the rate payers.
My friends demoralizing encounters with the public service are by no means isolated experiences. In the face of unpleasant circumstances, he chose to withdraw, remove himself from the reign of the Dehiwela Urban Council. Many do this, using different methods; instead of confronting the diminished public servant personally, they send accountants, clerks, peons and other agents to deal with the official, their personal dignity remaining unviolated. Not all can afford that comfortable option. For those who have to deal with the government, there are daily torments, denigrations to be endured.
However much one may wish to, for the vast majority there is no avoiding the State; from the cradle to the grave, big brother is with them like a shadow; professing the common good, but in truth, reducing the public to a state of a pitiable recipient of munificence. If a State provides the services it ought to, in the spirit meant to, there is no better friend. But when a State is unintelligent, inefficient and corrupt there is no worse liability for a nation.
In front of my house, right in the middle of Kirula Road, there is a manhole (there are many, including this!). About a month back, the metal cap covering the manhole came lose. As a result, when a vehicle goes over the manhole there is a loud noise, and thousands of vehicles go over it every day. If left unattended, sooner or later the loose cap could lead to a major road repair, if not a tragic accident. Public spirit moved me to look up the complaints section of the Colombo Municipality-Colombo East, the number given was 2514845. Several telephone calls, answered only after prolonged ringing, elicited the standard answer we will pass on your complaint to the relevant Sir.
The complaints section of the Municipality is indifferent, unaware of its own impotence, indulging in a meaningless exercise to no effect. Only another job has been created in the State sector, nothing more! Apparently, the complaints of the Colombo Municipality had no idea of either the location of Kirula Road or what a manhole is, demanding directions as well as an exposition of a manhole! I could well be reporting about something happening in another Planet!
Inefficiencies and corruption
After several days of inaction, the complaints phone was answered by a conspiratorial municipal employee I will give you the telephone number of the Supervisor in charge of your area. But dont tell him that I gave the number!. After all, why should the public know the telephone number of the person in charge of maintenance in their area!
The secret number given was 2513929. This Supervisor is a man of few words or was not comfortable explaining matters to a rate payer. His response was an excuse, mumbling that he has many things to attend to. Perhaps he is overwhelmed, or maybe he is overwhelmed easily. Several weeks have now passed, the manhole cap dances noisily, all day and all night!
These are only minor examples of the workings of a lumbering public service which has become the very opposite of what a service ought to be. Their inefficiencies and corruption has made the country a laughing stock, something which ought to be studied for its failures; systems which have served other countries well, failing miserably in this country.
Undoubtedly, there is the effect of the cultural DNA, a people who cannot rise to the requirements of an objective service standard; an outlook which can respond only to power or money. In other countries, a bribe can at least induce a kind of efficiency. But here, a bribe may stop something happening, or make a file disappear, but cannot ensure a positive result. A road supervisor may take a bribe to locate a manhole in a favourable site; but can he make it properly, to modern standards, leak-proof, with a cap that will not wobble after a few weeks The work standards he is used to, the culture in which he has grown up and now works, makes such a positive outcome, unlikely.
Excessively fussy
It is evident that after seventy years of self-rule, we have only managed to create a government which is less than competent. To telephone or write to a public servant is to be demanding, asking them to do something is not knowing your place, to criticize them is sheer effrontery. True, our taxes go to pay the remuneration package of the public servant, but that is the duty of the humble citizen. However, to demand service or expect any performance standards from the public service, is being excessively fussy.
From reading about the attitudes of public servant the reader may form a picture of an over-bearing, arrogant bureaucrat. This is furthest from the truth. In appearance most unimpressive; his, is not the proud bearing of a competent service provider, an able holder of office aware of the inherent worth of his service. The crassness of the public servant on the other hand comes, not from any sense of superiority, but from the realization of his deep seated inadequacies, insignificance, and inefficiency.
Across the waters surrounding us, there is a large world, rational and competitive. There are countries with sharp and effective administrations, looking for every opportunity to push their nations forward. They build industries, develop infrastructure, improve their service standards, enter into trade agreements, maintain a high quality education while also promoting their country in hundreds of other ways. To remain viable, we have to compete with such countries. This is a reality we cannot escape.

Murray pulls out of China Open
BEIJING: Former world number one Andy Murray has brought his season to a premature end, pulling out of the China Open in Beijing after reaching the quarter-finals at the Shenzhen Open.
The 31-year-old Briton is battling to regain top form and fitness following hip surgery in January but British media including the BBC said that he has suffered a minor ankle problem.
Murray was not included when the China Open draw was made on Saturday and also absent was world number three Novak Djokovic, who was offered a wildcard.
The China Open -- which begins this weekend -- has been hit by several high-profile pull-outs with Rafael Nadal not involved because of injury, Roger Federer saving himself for Shanghai and Serena Williams all absent.
Murray, ranked 311 in the world, previously said that Beijing would be his final tournament this season and he is carefully managing his schedule following his operation in order to get the most out of his creaking body.
He was beaten 6-4, 6-4 on Friday in Shenzhen by Spanish veteran Fernando Verdasco, although he defeated world number 11 David Goffin in the last 16 for the best win since his comeback.
Murray, a three-time Grand Slam title winner, will spend the winter working himself back to the sort of fitness levels that saw him capture nine titles in a stellar 2016 campaign, including his second Wimbledon crown and another Olympic gold.
It was another three matches, which is positive, said Murray after defeat to Verdasco.
But obviously I want to play better than that, I have higher ambitions than losing in the quarter-finals. I want to try to be better in these events.
I need to spend more time on the practice court and the gym so that I'm more robust and physically in better shape.
Juan Martin del Potro, the top seed in Beijing, will play Albert Ramos in his opener. -AFP

New Zealand beat Argentina to win sixth Rugby Championship
BUENOS AIRES: New Zealand won the Rugby Championship for the sixth time by beating Argentina 35-17 in Buenos Aires on Saturday as they put a stunning home defeat by South Africa behind them.
The All Blacks led 21-3 at half-time before a sell-out 50,000 crowd and scored first in the second half through substitute Patrick Tuipulotu.
New Zealands lock Samuel Whitelock receives the trophy after winning the Rugby Championship 2018 edition defeating Argentina 35-17, at Jose Amalfitani stadium in Buenos Aires, Argentina on September 29, 2018. AFP
Victory gave New Zealand an uncatchable seven-point advantage over South Africa ahead of their showdown in Pretoria next Saturday.
New Zealand have 21 points, South Africa 14, Argentina eight and Australia five with one round remaining in the southern hemisphere championship.
A shock 36-34 triumph in Wellington this month gave South Africa a glimmer of hope that they could overtake New Zealand and win the competition a first time.
But they failed to secure a bonus point as they ground out a 23-12 win over struggling Australia in Port Elizabeth earlier on Saturday.
That result left the All Blacks needing a win to secure the title and they outscored the Pumas by five tries to two to collect a bonus point as well.
No All Black was happier than fly-half Beauden Barrett who was successful with all four of his conversion attempts after missing four of six against the Springboks.
Argentina were first to score with star fly-half Nicolas Sanchez slotting an easy penalty after six minutes at the Estadio Jose Amalfitani.
But New Zealand reacted swiftly to falling behind and within two minutes were ahead as winger Rieko Ioane scored the first of his two tries.
Fellow winger Waisake Naholo came into midfield and played a key role in a move continued by Ben Smith before Ioane cut inside to score and Barrett converted.
Sonny Bill binned
Sanchez seemed certain to cut the gap to a single point from a close-range penalty but, to the amazement of the crowd, fluffed it.
Naholo changed from creator to scorer on 17 minutes, stretching to dot the ball down on the line after the scrummaging weakness of the Pumas was laid bare.
Barrett added the extra points and the world champions were 14-3 ahead midway through the half.
Ioane struck again with 30 minutes gone, scoring a try that infuriated the home crowd.
Codie Taylor appeared to knock the head of Bautista Delguy, but big-screen replays showed the New Zealander had been pushed first by an Argentine.
French referee Mathieu Raynal correctly awarded a try and Barrett converted from the touchline.
In-form Delguy was forced to retire after the accidental blow and Sebastian Cancelliere took his place on the right wing.
Argentina finished the first half strongly after All Black Sonny Bill Williams was sin-binned, but could not translate territory and possession into points and the All Blacks led 21-3 at half-time.
Sanchez wasted an early second-half chance to reduce the deficit when his penalty intended for unmarked winger Matias Moroni fell short and into the welcome hands of Naholo instead.
The Pumas were being let down at the set pieces with the All Blacks making life miserable for the South Americans at the scrums.
Both teams scored two tries during the second half with Tuipulotu and Anton Lienert-Brown crossing for New Zealand and Barrett and Richie Mo'unga converting.
Tomas Cubelli and Emiliano Boffelli were the Argentine scorers and Sanchez added the conversions.

No. 1 Halep retires hurt from China Open
Beijing, Sunday: World number one Simona Halep said that she was worried now after a persistent back problem forced her out of the China Open after just 31 miserable minutes on Sunday.
The Romanian never looked comfortable against Tunisian qualifier Ons Jabeur, losing the opening set of their first-round match 6-1 before calling it quits. The 27-year-old Halep suffered a back injury a week ago in Wuhan and she cut a forlorn figure after it ended her Beijing adventure prematurely.
The top-ranked Haleps departure is another blow to organisers in the Chinese capital, with Serena Williams missing from the womens draw and several big names also absent from the mens event. There is a pain, I couldnt move properly so thats why I stopped, Halep, who suffered a shock early exit from the recent US Open, said.
I dont know exactly what it is. I will go home, I will have an MRI (scan) and I will see.
Im just worried now, I feel sad that I couldnt finish, Halep added, saying that she feared playing was making the problem worse and she knew from the start of the match that she was struggling. AFP

No dividends received for EPFs 500 mn share investment in SriLankan in 2010
The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) had not received any dividends from its funds amounting to Rs.500 million invested to buy shares in the Emirates owned SriLakan Airliens in 2010 on an intimation received from the Bank of Ceylon.

Cross-examined by Additional Solicitor General Neil Unambowe PC, Mrs. Bandara said that proper and continuous observation and assessment of the EPF began only after 2015 and there was no such practices prior to 2105.
She said Cabinet approval had been given on July 6,2010 for the Bank of Ceylon and the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation to purchase only 43.63 percent of Emirates shares at SriLankan Airlines valued at 53 million US dollars. But breaching all regulations, the Middle Office of the Central Bank had taken this course of action in purchasing shares, according to documentary proof.
Witness said that the Bank of Ceylon had only informed that it would join hands with the Peoples Bank, National Savings Bank, EPF, ETF and the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation to purchase these shares.
She knew that apart from EPF, the other two banks had joined this exercise but she was unaware whether the other institutions had joined it. she said at the time this investment was made Ajith Nivaard Cabral functioned as Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and Dr.P.B.

Nutrition for healthy ageing
This week Dr. Lasantha Ganewatta, MBBS (SL), MD(Colombo), FRCP(London), MRCP (UK), DGM (Geriatrics)(UK), MRCP-SCE (Geriatrics)(UK) speak about the nutrition of elderly. She functions as a Consultant Physician attached to the Ministry of Health Sri Lanka. Dr Ganewatta has obtained qualifications in Geriatric (Elderly Care) Medicine from Royal College of Physicians, London and obtained on-the-job training attached to Geriatric Medical Ward in Queens Hospital, London, UK.
Q- What type of nutrition is required for elders
A - The process of ageing affects many aspects of well being in aged population. Nutrition in elderly is one of them. In spite of having nearly 12 percent of population who are more than 60 years of age in the country (this will be 30 percent by 2050), their nutritional requirements are poorly understood and inadequately addressed by both health professionals and their careers. Therefore, they are simply vulnerable to develop malnutrition and nutritional deficiencies. On the other hand, many elders are suffering from chronic diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, stroke, and memory impairments etc, which require dietary modification as a mandatory requirement in the management. Hence, nutrition in old age is mostly individualized according to their health background. Not only that but also their cultural preferences, financial situation, availability of foods, level of activity and food habits should be kept in mind. Considering all aspects, finally they shall enjoy the diet which they consume.
Q- What type of food should they be provided
A - They should be provided nearly 1/3 of starchy or carbohydrate rich food in the plate which needs to be composed of high fiber content like in legumes and whole grains. The hallmark of ageing is the gradual loss of muscle mass and strength. This is called sarcopenia. This phenomenon leads to many of the problems in elderly including frailty, recurrent falls, poor balance and postural instability etc. To maintain good muscle function, elderly people need protein rich foods like fish, meat, egg and pulses. Their protein requirement is nearly 50 to 60g per day in other words 0.8 to1g per kg body weight. Elderly do suffer from many micro nutrients deficiencies which need to maintain metabolism, immune boosting, memory functions and smooth-running body systems. The best way to recover them is to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. They are good sources of dietary fibers as well.
Bone health is paramount important in old age as they lose bone mass with time and vulnerable to develop osteoporosis. Hence, calcium and vitamin D rich foods are highly recommended. Milk and other dairy products, small fish and fruits and vegetables are good sources of calcium and vitamin D. No one should forget sunlight is a natural way to enhance your vitamin D levels.
Vitamin B and C, beta carotene, iron, zinc, large chain omega 3 fatty acids are some of the highlighted nutrients in elderly in addition to the above discussed. Fish, fruits and vegetables, nuts and dairy products are rich in those elements.
Finally, good hydration is very important to maintain their well being. 1.5 to 2 litres of fluid per day is advised for healthy individuals. If you have some illnesses like heart problems or kidney impairment your daily fluid requirement will be decided by your physician. Adequate hydration reverses many health-related problems in elderly including infections, acute confusional status, drug side effects, body itching etc.
Q- What type of food and beverages they should avoid to protect themselves from various health complications
A - As we discussed in the previous question, elderly suffer from chronic illnesses like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, kidney diseases etc. Or else they are more prone to develop one or more of them compared to younger counterpart. Therefore, they shall avoid sugar rich foods, high fat containing items and salt concentrated foods. 3g to 5g per day salt intake is healthy for them. Eating natural foods is always healthier than prepared foods those are high in sugars, salt and many unhealthy preservatives. Drinking water is the best fluid that we could offer them.
However, there is a cohort of elderly who are frail with very poor appetite and consume very little amount of foods. They need calories, protein, fat and other nutrients condensed meal which meets their requirement even with 2 or 3 mouthfuls. And also they need less restriction. We should make sure to provide their preferences with different tastes and different consistencies.
Q- Do elders need additional vitamins, minerals, supplements etc in addition to their daily food intake
A - Many of the family members who look after their old relatives request to prescribe nutritional supplements irrespective of their eating habits.
This mostly depends on the nutritional assessment of your elderly patient. If you find their consumption is inadequate to meet the requirement, you may prescribe some supplement provided they follow your advice for a reasonable period.
However, natural foods provide many benefits compared supplements. It contains number of nutrients in a single unit, is rich in fibers and are easy to absorb from gut compared to supplements. Therefore, nutritional supplements should not replace the healthy meal in elderly and better to consult your physician before you consume them.
Q- How important is nutritional assessment in elderly
A - When we practice Geriatric medicine or elderly care medicine we use different nutrition assessment tools in order to recognize current nutritional status of the individual as well as to assess their response to the nutritional intervention. In young people this assessment is not complicated as their height, weight and body mass index give a better idea of their nutritional situation. When it comes to old age, in addition to those parameters we should consider multi factorial aspects of their nutrition. Your assessment needs to address many of them. They suffer from many chronic illnesses, considerable number of them have element of depression they consume lot of drugs and with ageing they lose taste and smell sensation ultimately leading to poor appetite. They could not chew properly due to poor dentition. Food swallowing is also affected in some of them. As you know dementia and associated behavioral problems are frequent health related issues in old age where they cannot remember to eat meals and do not have hunger sensation. Not only that, aged gut is malfunctioning leading to poor digestion and absorption of foods. Most elderly have constipation which is an independent risk factor for poor appetite. You should not forget physical disabilities which can compromise from buying foods ready to swallow.
Food intake and final nutritional status in older individuals are multifaceted and need multi-disciplinary approach.
Q- How should elders balance their food intake and exercises How much sleep do they need
A - As we discussed in previous questions they need to have a healthy and balanced diet with some considerations to special requirements. Their meals need to have enough carbohydrates nearly 1/3 of the plate. Those shall be good sources of energy with fibers like legumes and whole grains. And approximately 1/5 to 1/6 of meal would consist of fat containing foods. And same amount of milk and dairy products. Elderly should take adequate amount of protein rich foods like fish, meats, eggs and legumes. Recommended value is 0.8 to 1g per kg body weight. They need to eat fruits and vegetables at least 1/4 of the meal. With all these they need to drink around 1.5 to 2 liters of fluid to maintain better hydration.
Accumulating evidence shows physical exercises improve their chronic illnesses and cognitive function. Not only that strength and balance training exercises will reverse or slow the process of sarcopenia. Recommendation is to do at least 30 minutes a day for 5 days per week. Brisk walking, cycling and swimming are good for their health. However, they need to get advice from their physician before commencing.
Sleep hygiene is important to improve the blood pressure, blood sugar, heart function, memory and ultimately physical well-being. They are advised to have 6 to 8 hours of healthy and uninterrupted sleep per day.
All these advice and recommendations are invariably beneficial to lead healthy old age.
Q- A lot of elders consume various types of herbal plants/herbs stating that they are good for diabetes, hypertension etc. Is this good or bad
A - It is a difficult question to answer. We do observe, some of our elderly patients prefer to have different herbs to improve their chronic illnesses. The medicine we use for their illnesses are studied in many aspects for many years in different populations prior to recommending for the prescription. Still they do have adverse effects and failures.
You may understand, if someone consumes an herb which is not well studied, no one could predict the benefit or the problem of it. On the other hand, adequate dosage and frequency of a medicine is fundamentally important to predict the treatment level. Some alterations in dosage are frequency needed in some illnesses like kidney and liver problems.
Those aspects are not addressed if you take herbal medicine on your own. Therefore, meet your physician and get correct advice which suits for your illness.

Pass the tortoise shell
The history of the book does not always involve the study of either history or books. As James Raven shows in this slim, engaging volume, the question of what sort of object might count as a book remains very much up for debate. The history of the book in the Western world has traditionally made book synonymous with codex  gatherings of leaves folded or stitched together  but in Professor Ravens geographically and chronologically wide-ranging account, it takes a variety of material forms: Chinese tortoise shells inscribed 3,000 years ago; Sumerian clay tablets impressed with cuneiform scripts; knotted string records, or khipus, used for record-keeping by South American Incan officials.
The boundaries of the book seem even less clearly defined in the era of the blog post and Kindle.
Furthermore, the history of the book might not capture the full range and diversity of a scholarly endeavour that now encompasses work in literary studies, sociology, anthropology and computer science. Data-driven projects such as the Open Universitys Reading Experience Database consider histories of book provenance and use on an aggregate scale. Advanced word and phrase search functions in databases such as Google Books and the HathiTrust Digital Library have allowed a computational approach to traditional literary-critical investigations concerning questions of style, authorship and literary influence.
Objects of inquiry
Online collections  among them Early English Books Online and Eighteenth Century Collections Online  have replaced reels of microfilm with digital images.
The field Robert Darnton described in the early 1980s as the social and cultural history of communication by print now involves objects of inquiry and methodological approaches that would have been hard to imagine even a few decades ago, such as work on born-digital archives (such as emails and Word documents) or computer models that can superimpose historical records of book ownership over geographic data.
It is a credit to What Is the History of the Book that it emphasizes enduring questions about the scope of book history while defining the parameters of the field in enough detail to advance towards a global, accessible introduction to the field of book history from ancient to modern times. The book also gestures towards emerging areas of scholarship, particularly in an illuminating chapter on the history of reading. Raven writes that reading is the most significant and challenging dimension of the history of books. Because it leaves few material records, reading remains one of the most elusive practices to capture in historical terms. For example, it is not always a silent, solitary activity. As Paul Saenger and other scholars have shown, there is significant evidence that many people in pre-modern Europe heard books more than they read them. But how can historians and literary critics account for a form of engagement with books that, more often than not, left no trace behind
Historicizing reading
The upturn in scholarly interest in readers marginalia in the past thirty years offers one way of historicizing reading. But as Raven reminds us, book usage . . . need not correspond to what is generally regarded as reading. Leah Price and Adam Smyth, among others, have investigated a range of activities that might also be considered under the rubric of reading  skimming books, recycling them, venerating them. In one of Prices memorable anecdotes from Victorian Britain, a woman is accused of matching her book bindings to the colour of her dresses. The earliest forms of Japanese woodblock printing, Raven points out, were associated with various forms of ceremonial practice and prayer that allowed the book to be displayed as a preventative shaman. Raven suggests persuasively that not reading is as much a part of the history of the book as reading, since ritual attendance to the book as a physical object may have been, for certain people, far more important than actual reading. The books ambitious scope inevitably leads to a sense that some areas have been given short shrift. Raven namechecks half-a-dozen scholars in a sentence and his references to international book historical scholarship (There followed notable published work from India, Mexico, Brazil, Japan, and South Africa, he writes in one section) can sometimes seem either overwhelming or too sweeping.
But Raven has written an admirably cogent account of the field that is accessible to the general reader and makes a strong case for a more culturally inclusive understanding of the book in history. A global history of the book, for example, places Gutenbergs printing revolution  a now contested narrative  in conversation with the origins of printing in Asia. The prevalence of unattributed and miscellaneous literary collections in Chinese books before the twentieth century troubles Western understandings of authorship and literary canon formation.
The advantage of imagining the book as a global phenomenon, Raven shows, is that it defamiliarizes a history we think we know, raising questions about the changing nature of reading and writing across time and space.

Power of a  planted seed
A home garden provides us a continuous source of nutritious and healthy food. Yet in order to maintain a successful and productive home garden we need to build a controlled environment. We call this controlled Environment  A Nursery. Green Thumbs speaks to District Agriculture Instructor, Office of Deputy Provincial Agriculture Rathmalana G.D. Udaya Kumara on Nurseries where plants are nurtured to perfection and introduced into the Home Garden.
One of the main reasons in maintaining a Home Garden is to provide the family with a continuous supply of Vegetables, Spices, root crops and fruits. The stock must be of good quality and it needs to be healthy. There has to be a daily supply of food from a variety of crops.
A Home Garden must be sustainable. Nurseries are vital to the growth of plants for home gardens and commercially. For commercial purposes plants are grown to be marketed, so farmers can earn an income. In a Home Garden, though the produce can be sold to shops, the main reason behind a home garden is to provide the family with their daily intake of food, said Udaya Kumara.
The idea behind a nursery is to develop the plant material which would otherwise grow poorly if immediately planted in the home garden.
A small nursery can be maintained in your home garden where the planting material can be developed. Raising a good crop depends on how good your nursery is. The nursery can protect the small plants grown within its confines from weather conditions, pests and diseases and it can ensure a high quality yield. The plants growing in the beds or in the pots can be observed so we can supervise its growth, stated Udaya Kumara.A nursery can be built in a place where there is ample sunshine, where it can be irrigated and in a place where there is no flooding. There could be vegetable nurseries, fruit nurseries and flower nurseries. However normally in a home garden we pay more attention to fruits and vegetables.
There are some vegetables that require a nursery  Tomato, Green Chili, Brinjals, Cabbage, leeks and beet. We need to keep in mind that some plants originate in small seeds. Because the seeds are small we need nurseries. They are not hardy plants that can survive if directly introduced into the home garden. The seeds are attacked by pests. Ants can eat the seeds. Also weather conditions can have an adverse effect. However there are plants that dont require a nursery. They can be immediately introduced to the garden. These are beans, ladies fingers and Dambala. They have large seeds, explained Udaya Kumara.
There are two types of nurseries  beds and pots. If you take pots there are different types. Polythene, Yoghurt Cups, Coconut husks, curd pots and ice cream containers. There is also new technology such as Sponge Pots and Geffy Pots.
When you take nursery beds if you add 1kg of top soil you need to add 1kg of organic manure. You can also mix 250g of sand and 250g of coir fiber. However this soil mixture has to be prepared further. This is because you need to destroy the bacteria, fungus and nematodes.
First we need to prepare the above soil medium when creating the nursery bed. Then we need to pour water on the bed. Then we cover the bed with polythene. Then we allow sunlight to fall. The heat that results will kill the bacteria and fungus. We keep it in this state for one week, pointed out Udaya Kumara.
Another technique we can use is to burn the soil. As before we prepare the nursery bed and the soil medium. Again we pour water. Then we apply a paddy husk layer 1  2 inches. We then apply straw over the bed. Then we again apply another second layer of paddy husk. Then we apply a second layer of straw. And we set fire to it. That should kill the bacteria and fungus.
After both these methods we plant the seeds in the beds. After planting these seeds we use the mulch to cover the beds. This mulch could be goniya or poly sack bag. When the plants appear the mulch is taken off and you have an active nursery. However it needs watering, weeding, fertilizer needs to be applied and pests and diseases need to be controlled. The plants then can be removed from the nursery and planted in the home garden.
There are of course additional advantages to planting in pots. Here the medium is prepared separately (1kg of top soil: 1kg of organic manure. Mix 250g of sand and 250g of coir fiber) and filled into the pots.
Here the root damage is less. When you grow the plants in the beds and remove them to re- plant them in the home garden, when removing them from the beds the roots get damaged. But when growing in pots the soil mound is removed from the pots and planted in the home garden so the roots do not get damaged at all. Also because the roots do not get damaged when growing in pots, the plant is not vulnerable to soil borne diseases. We know that when the roots are damaged there is a wound and bacteria and fungus enter into the plants because of the wound  through the wound, explained Udaya Kumara.
Also because roots do not get damaged, environmental conditions do not have that much of an adverse effect on the plants. Also because roots do not get damaged you can reap a good harvest in shorter time.

 Brinjals  3-4 weeks
 Tomato - 2-3 weeks
 Green chili  3-4 weeks
 Capsicum  3 weeks
 Cabbage  3-4 weeks
 Beet  4-6 weeks

Prepping soil for your plants
Its true that all plants need is sun, soil, and water. But thats not all there is to it. Good soil is critical for growing healthy, strong plants. Whether youre growing vegetables, flowers, or just a really nice patch of dandelions, you need to prepare your soil to get the best results.
Good soil has lots of organic matter (like decaying leaves and compost), nutrients for the plants, living organisms (like earthworms and fungi), and it needs to be turned or loosened so the roots can get oxygen and water can drain.
There are different ways to prepare your soil for planting.
Lasagna Method
Its not called the lasagna method because youre growing lasagna plants. With this method, you prepare the soil by layering different materials on top of each other, like the layers in lasagna
It starts like this: mow the grass or the weeds down as far as you can. Lay flattened cardboard boxes over the grass, right next to each other with the edges touching. Use moving boxes or non-shiny cardboard, and take off any tape because it wont decompose. Spray the boxes with enough water to dampen, and then stomp on them a bit to get them to settle. You dont want them to blow away before you get to the next step.
On top of the cardboard, put layers of newspaper. Again, dont use the slick ad pages but just the regular newspaper pages. Arrange them kind of like shingles so no weeds can grow through. Dampen again and stompcarefully this time, because youve got two wet materials to deal with.
The final step is to cover the newspaper layer with a thick layer (like 2 inches or more) of shredded leaves, straw, or other brown composting material. Then add alternating layers of green composting material, like veggie scraps, manure, lawn clippings, etc. and brown composting material.
It takes several months for the grass to die and for the lasagna layers to break down and turn into rich, useable soil.
Double digging
Double digging is a soil preparation technique that most people havent heard of. Its very labour-intensive and is used for plants with deep roots like carrots or beets.
Start by digging a trench one foot wide and one foot deep. It can be as long as you want it to be. Pile all the dirt you dig up into a wheelbarrow or put it on a tarp out of your way.
Then dig another trench next to the first one, also one foot wide and one foot deep with the same length. Go back to your first trench, and loosen the soil at the bottom of the trench (so youre digging the first hole deeper). Put the soil you dug up from the second trench into the first trench.
Lather, rinse, and repeat until you have dug all the trenches you need. Fill the last trench with the soil you dug up from the first one.

Private traders buy bulk of paddy harvest
Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) Chairman Upali Mohotti told the Daily News on Friday that the government had allocated Rs. 4,900 million for the purchasing of paddy from farmers during this Yala season, but the private sector has purchased about 98 percent of the paddy harvest.
The PMB was able to buy only two percent of the paddy harvest this year as private businessmen had offered farmers a higher price for their harvest, Mohotti said.
