Lankan hopes at Rio Olympics: NILUKA KARUNARATNE

The countrys undisputed badminton champion Niluk Karunaratne would have played cricket for Sri Lanka, if he had not opted for the shuttle sport as a teenager.
I played cricket for my school in under-15 division 1 tournament and our team emerged all-island champions. My father was in England at that time. But since his return after a stint in England, I was concentrating on badminton and opted to master that sport, Karunaratne told the Daily News.
Karunaratne is raring to come out with another sensational performance when he competes in the mens singles event at the forthcoming Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. The 31-year-old king in local mens badminton has made a vast improvement in recent times under his South Korean coach Kim Young Man.
It was the same coach who trained Karunaratne in Poland during his lead up to the last Olympic Games in London four years ago. Another proud product of Royal College, Karunaratne had the rare honour of becoming the overall captain of the Sri Lanka contingent for the last Olympics and sprang one of the biggest surprises at the London 2012 Games badminton competition.
He humbled eight-seeded Kenichi Tago of Japan in the first round of the mens singles 21-18, 21-16  the best performance by a Lankan shuttler in Olympic history. Thus Karunaratne had the honour of making it to the pre-quarter finals where he was knocked out by Indias Parupalli Kashyap after a fighting performance 14-21, 21-15, 9-21.
Impressed by the South Korean coachs efforts, Karunaratne has retained his services  this time under home conditions. Unlike for the last Olympics, I have been training in Sri Lanka for Rio 2016 Games and personally hired my previous coach who has worked hard with me for the London Games, he said.
I have improved a lot since the last Olympics. Since my appearance at the London 2012, I have beaten many top players. I am in good shape, making the ideal preparations for my second Olympic Games, he said.
I am in much better shape now, compared to where I was when I made my Olympic debut in 2012. I have played the longest match in world badminton for the past 20 years, beating Finlands No. 1 Ville Lang, he said.
The 14-time Sri Lanka national champion in mens singles has been in the international circuit since he was 18, beating many top ranked players. Unfortunately, he has not been fortunate enough to win a major championship in recent times, although he has come closer to winning international titles in Australia, Wales, Belgium and Iran.
Nevertheless, he has proved his might by beating some top shuttlers in international tournaments in Miami, Puerto Rico, Wales, Iran and Uganda.
He had come across top ranked players from Indonesia, Malaysia, Canada, England and Wales in the above tournaments.
Karunaratne, born on February 13, 1985 in Galle, took to badminton at the age of eight years like a duck taking to water, following the footsteps of his father Louvie Karunaratne, a former national level champion and a veteran coach. My father took me to witness some matches and even coaching sessions for his players when I was very young. That made badminton my passion from an early age, he said.
Only a year after making his debut in major competitions, Karunaratne won the Amazon Circuit, showing early signs of a champion in the making. It will be a Herculean task for anybody to better Karunaratnes record of becoming national mens single champion for 14 year. He has won the national singles title for nine consecutive years, bettering Ravi Kuruppus record of six times.
I know that I am both mentally and physically fit for the challenge ahead. I want to make use of every opportunity that comes my way and Olympics are no exception but a very special moment in my career. My aim is the make my presence felt and spring a surprise as I did the last time. I know I could do something, something special for my country, he added.
The recent banning of the Sri Lanka Badminton Association by the world governing body over a constitutional dispute (a few other national bodies in other sports too suffered the same fate) prevented Karunaratne from playing for Sri Lanka in several major international tournaments.
As a result, his international ranking in world mens singles has dropped drastically from 34th to 93rd.
Nevertheless, Karunaratne has not been starved of international competition. He found entry to several top tournaments at which he came across several top-ranked players in the world circuit.
Asked what his plans would be after the Olympic Games, the champion shuttler said he wishes to remain in the international circuit for a few more years. I will continue to play for the country, I have a few more years left in my career and would make every effort to make my country proud, he said.
The winner of the Royal Crown at his alma mater for his outstanding performance as a champion badminton player, Karunaratne said he has been training hard over the past several months, focusing fully on his second Olympic appearance.
It is a tough task ahead. But I am geared to face the challenge. I will definitely make my presence felt in Rio, said the overall captain of the Sri Lanka contingent for the last London 2012 Games. There are no short cuts in becoming a badminton champion. Hard work and dedication is the art, as in any other sport. You cannot produce a champion overnight and there are no instant recipes. It takes at least five years of hard training to become a national badminton champion, was Karunaratnes advice to those taking to the sport.

OKeefe (10/64 & 78 n.o.) presses for Test place : Pathetic batting hands Australia crushing win

Pathetic was how the Sri Lanka Board Presidents XI coach cum manager Piyal Wijetunge described his teams woeful batting performance when they were bundled out for a paltry 83 runs in their second innings to hand out to the touring Australians a crushing innings and 162 runs win on the third morning of the 3-day practice match played at the P Sara Oval yesterday.
The pitch was turning alright but no one batted well. It was not a track where you can be bowled out inside a session of play, said Wijetunge. The chief destroyer of the Board Presidents innings was once again left-arm spinner Steve OKeefe who finished with another five-for haul to end the match with impressive figures of 10 for 64.
The Malaysian-born New South Welshman has turned this match into one of his own by excelling not only with the ball but also with the bat as well.
Australia added another 43 runs to their overnight total of 431-9 to be all out for 474 with Jackson Bird being the last wicket to fall for 32 leaving OKeefe as the top scorer of the innings with an unbeaten 78 scored off 139 balls with nine fours. The two frustrated the home team bowlers for nearly an hour adding 58 for the last wicket.
OKeefes all-round contribution in the match is a kind of performance that the Australian tour selectors would find hard to ignore ahead of the first Test against Sri Lanka at Pallekele on Tuesday week.
OKeefe proved quite a handful for the Board Presidents XI batters as they surrendered meekly to be dismissed before lunch on the final day.
Their total capitulation in 20.5 overs was something that was hard to swallow. If this is the type of performance some of the future Sri Lankan players in the team can come up with then we have a serious problem ahead of us in terms of national team selection.
They were in fact one batsman short with opener Madawa Warnapura ruled out of the match with a dislocated left shoulder, but that was no excuse for this substandard batting performance.
Only two batsmen got into double figures  Shehan Jayasuriya (29) who was promoted to open in the absence of Warnapura and Asela Gunaratne (23), the rest of the batting was swept under the carpet by OKeefe after Mitchell Starc had given Australia the initial breakthrough with two early wickets.
How much turn the pitch offered cannot be judged by the Australian batting performance because they were exposed to only 54 overs of spin of the total of 132.3 overs their innings lasted.

Lankan team leaves for U18 Asian Schools Rugby Sevens today   : Adjusting from 15s rugby to 7s is not easy  coach Mushtaq

The selection panel of the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union (SLRFU) headed by chairman-Michael Jayasekara (S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia) ably assisted by Hisham Abdeen (Isipathana College), Kapila Knowlton (Mahanama College) and L.V. Ekanayake (St. Anthonys College Kandy) has selected the final 12-member squad for the upcoming Under 18 Asian Schools Rugby Sevens Championship.
The squad along with head coach M.J.M. Mushtaq and manager K.S.P. Karunaratne are due to leave for Hong Kong tonight.
Three players each from Isipathana College and Trinity College Kandy, two players each from S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia and St. Josephs College Maradana and one player each from St. Peters College Bambalapitiya and St. Anthonys College Kandy have secured a place in the Sri Lanka Under-18 Asian Schools Rugby Sevens squad.
The Championship is scheduled to take place in Hong Kong from July 22-26 at Kings grounds.
The national selectors finalized the 12-member touring squad yesterday. The team will be led by S. Thomas College wing three quarter Henakankanamge Naveen, the son of former Isipathana College and Navy SC centre three quarter H.K. Sisira. Sumudu Rankothge the Isipathana vice-captain cum centre will be his deputy.
Head coach M.J.M. Mushtaq in his first assignment as head coach of a national rugby team said, With the coaching staff we have made every effort to change the mindset of the players to face the tough opponents and go for victory against the likes of Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia, who have registered wins against us in the recent past.
We have a good set of forwards as well as three quarters. The players are in a good frame of mind and are hoping for a positive result. My only worry is that we did not have much time to practice as a team together. Its only a mere one week we did practice together. The boys were after the schools 15-a-side tournament, hence to get adjusted to playing style of Sevens all of a sudden is a very difficult task and definitely not that easy," said Mushtaq. "But with these talented players we will give our best shot.
Touring squad of 12:
Henakankanamage Naveen (Captain)  S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia, Sumudu Rankothge (Vice Captain)  Isipathana College, Chamod Fernando  Isipathana College, Harith Bandara  Isipathana College, Diyath Fernando  St. Peters College Bambalapitiya, Avishka Shiek  Trinity College Kandy, Diluksha Dange  Trinity College Kandy, Anuka Boyagoda  Trinity College Kandy, Christian De Lile  S.

They deserved the win  Pubudu Dassanayake: Nepal XI defeat MCC in Lords debut

Nepal inscribed another noteworthy entry in their cricketing history by winning on their first visit to Lord's on Tuesday in front of several thousand delighted fans.
On a sweltering day in north London, a Nepal XI defeated MCC by 41 runs after which the Nepal captain, Paras Khadka, led his players around the outfield to pay tribute to their typically exuberant supporters.
Having chosen to bat first, Nepal's every run was cheered to the rafters by a crowd of around 5000 that spread itself out across the Mound, Tavern, Edrich and Allen stands. Boundaries and wickets brought even greater outbursts of adulation and chants of "Ne-pal! Ne-pal! Ne-pal!" echoed around the old ground as Sompal Kami and Basant Regmi cleaned up the tail to dismiss MCC for 176 in pursuit of 218 in 50 overs.
The fixture was arranged as part of celebrations to mark the 200-year-old relationship between Britain and Nepal, with proceeds from the match going towards rebuilding work in Nepal after last year's earthquake.
MCC were captained by former Middlesex and Somerset allrounder Keith Dutch and included former Queensland batsman Clinton Perren and South Africa-born fast bowler Chad Barrett, who made his only first-class appearance for Northamptonshire two years ago.
Former Sri Lanka wicket-keeper Pubudu Dassanayake, who stepped down as Nepal coach last year after being involved in some of their greatest moments of recent times, joined the celebrations in the dressing room afterwards. Dassanayake has been back working with the side recently as a consultant, arranged by the ICC, and his pride in their achievement was obvious.
"These boys, the amount of work they put in, they deserve this, to come and play a game here," Dassanayake said. "They make a lot of sacrifices and fight always."

Previous regimes attempt at reconciliation:
Sending tri forces personnel before War Tribunal - PM
The previous government attempted to build up reconciliation by sending members of the Tri Forces personnel before a war tribunal, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickemesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
He further said the previous government promised UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon in May 2009, that the government was ready to send the Tri Forces members before the War Tribunal and promised the same to Darushaman. But when the leaders realised that they too would have to go before the tribunal they opposed against it, Premier Wickremesinghe said.
The Premier also said that when President Maithripala Sirisena joined them, such matters were changed and there was no issue of a war tribunal. Now we have the process of truth and reconciliation.
He made these observations yesterday to a question raised by Opposition Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa during the round of questions for oral answers. MP Wimal Weerawansa questioned whether an institution has been established by the name of Task Force for National Reconciliation. National Policies and Economic Affairs Minister Niroshan Perera answered in the negative. MP Weerawansa then queried whether the media reports were false that former President Chandrika Kumaratunga was the executive of the same institution.
At this stage the Premier stated that the Minister had answered to the question positively and queried if MP Weerawansa objected to the reconciliation process. You can clarify it from former President Chandrika Kumarathunge, as she is one of your friends. You earlier set up a government with her. Didnt you If you need it, I will ask it from her and let you know.
She was an old friend of us. But now she is a new friend of yours, Weerawansa said. No, we used to learn dancing together. Such was our past whatever the political differences we have, the Premier said. He also challenged Wimal Weerawansa to express if he had any objections to the reconciliation process.
Wimal Weerawansa said it was the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa who commenced the reconciliation process after uniting the nation. He warned not to mislead Parliament. He also said that the previous government did not agree to produce the members of the Tri Forces before the war tribunal. He said Sinhalese students in the Jaffna University are being assaulted by Tamil students and was the reconciliation brought about by this government, adding that he would not ask any more questions.
Premier Wickramasinghe said that it could be clarified when studying what the previous government agreed to Ban Ki Moon and what Mohan Peiris said to Darushaman.
He also queried as to what happens if some one attempt to build up reconciliation if Weerawansa did not object reconciliation.
He added that it did not matter if it was former President Chandrika Kumarathunga or Mhinda Rajapaks who attempt to build up reconciliation. Premier also invited MP Weerawansa to join to build up reconciliation if he wished.
CEB losses due to issues in coal supply by Noble Resources Ltd
The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has incurred heavy losses due to the issues in coal supply by Noble Resources Ltd., until 2015, Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said in Parliament yesterday.
He was making a ministerial statement on the controversy surrounding the coal procurement tender for the year 2015.
Citing several examples, the Minister said Nobel Resources had supplied coal at higher prices than the index price in 2011, resulting in heavy losses several times due to non-supply of the required amount of coal.
The minister said the shortage of coal resulted in either shutting down the Lakvijaya power plant or by purchasing coal at higher prices from Taurian without following proper tender procedures over the past years. The Minister said 2015 was the only year where the Lakvijaya plant received the required stocks of coal without any shortage under supplier Swiss Singapore Ltd.
Nobel Resources had secured the coal procurement tender on five occasions until 2015. However, on all these occasions, the said company had never been selected by the Tender Board, but by a Cabinet paper or by the Procurement Appeal Board. The company had made it a habit to create a coal shortage when the next tender was about to be given. The CEB, the Ministry and the Cabinet have been forced to give the tender to the same company to avoid a coal shortage, he said.
The minister, commenting on the tender for the year 2015, said it was decided to obtain 50 percent of the coal requirement through spot tenders, while the balance 50 percent by a long term tender. He said the purpose of this system was to break the monopoly in coal supply. He said several loopholes in the criteria followed when selecting the suitable company for long term tenders, have been identified. He pointed out that hardly any country considered the size of coal as a criteria in offering coal procurement tenders, adding that this error should be rectified immediately.
He said the tender for the year 2015, was called in November 2014, adding that giving it to Swiss Singapore over Noble Resources, had saved Rs 1,100 million to the CEB. The minister also pointed out that the calculation of Rs 1,803 million loss was misleading.
Some had compared the index price of US$ 58 to the spot tender price of US$ 51.25 and showed the difference of US$ 6.75 as a loss. This is not correct. We obtained the Attorney Generals advice on the Supreme Court decision on the matter. While following his advice, we will make sure the best decision beneficial to the country would be taken in this regard, he commented.
The minister further said that he expected the report of the tri-member committee he appointed to look in to the matter before July 29, adding that the final decisions would be made after studying the report.
We will take action if there has been any fault in the procedure taken. It is equally important to make an in-depth observation to find out whether the officials made those decisions honestly and justly, he concluded.
MR had appointed 250 consultants to projects under RDA - Minister Kiriella
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has appointed 250 consultants to various projects under the Road Development Authority, said Leader of the House, Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella in Parliament yesterday.
He said that it was highly questionable as to why the Opposition queried about the consultants who were duly appointed, without questioning of previous appointments. He said that not a single investigation was held on the appointments made under the previous government.
He made these observations in response to a question raised by JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa.
The Minister said that he would look into the matter that two from the same family had been appointed as consultants of projects under the Road Development Authority when Nalinda Jayatissa said that Savinda Samarasooriya and Cyril Samarasooriya of the same family have been appointed as consultants.
The Minister promised to provide a detailed answer to the MP on a later date with regard to reasons for recruiting a monk when MP Jayatissa inquired of the appointment of a bhikku as a consultant of the RDA.
Responding to the MPs question, the number of consultants recruited to the Southern Transport Development Project of the RDA, the Minister said it was 56.
We have won the Presidential election with an 81,000 lead and the General election with a lead of 131,000 in Kandy with the support of these people. We have to do something in return for them, the Minister said. He said the appointments are for a period of one year.
MP Jayatissa said that each consultant was entitled to a monthly allowance of Rs 25,000 and a transport allowance of Rs 40,000. He added that some possessed only GCE (O/L) as qualifications.

As at present, there are 8,388 vacancies to be filled in the Public Service, Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said in Parliament yesterday.
He was responding to a question raised by UNP MP S M Marikkar. Minister Karunathilake replied on behalf of the Public Administration and Management Minister.

He said a committee headed by the Public Administration and Management Ministry had been appointed for this purpose and Development Officers would be relocated to make their service more productive.
He said that there were 207 vacancies at present in the Sri Lanka Administrative Service, 178 vacancies in the Sri Lanka Scientific Service, 18 vacancies in the Sri Lanka Architects Service, 147 vacancies in the Sri Lanka Engineering Service, 184 vacancies in the Sri Lanka Accountants Service, 137 vacancies in the Sri Lanka Planning Service, 199 vacancies in the Government Translators Service, 394 vacancies in the Government Librarians Service, 2,340 vacancies in the Public Management Assistants Service, 1071 vacancies in the Sri Lanka Information Technology Division, 3270 vacancies in the Development Officers Service, 55 vacancies in the Office Employees Service and 188 vacancies in the Drivers Service.
JVP wants special debate on Coal Power Tender
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Parliament yesterday, requested a special debate on the controversy surrounding the Coal Procurement Tender.
He made this request following a lengthy statement by Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya.
Offering the coal supply tender to Noble Resources for many years is no secret. Links concerning the local agent of this company is widely known. It is a good thing that this government made attempts to follow the tender procedure once again. The problem is that a similar deal had taken place at this instance with the company selected by the tender procedure.
The Committee appointed by the President had stated that the tender was questionable. Ministry Secretary had submitted the Cabinet paper ignoring the Procurement Appeal Boards decision. That was the reason that the matter was taken before the Supreme Court. The SC had expressed concern in this regard. Therefore we urge to facilitate an extensive debate in this regard, MP Dissanayake said.
The Minister agreed to facilitate a special debate on the matter. He also observed that the President appointed the said committee the same day after approving the Cabinet paper for the tender, adding that its report came several months later.

Info concerning buses via SMS - Abeysinghe
The Government is to launch a special project to correct flaws in the GPS technology systems in buses and enable commuters to receive all information about buses via the Short Message Service, said Transport and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe.
He made this observation yesterday in Parliament in response to a question raised by Opposition MP Sunil Handunnetti.
Admitting that there are flaws in the GPS technology system that was introduced to buses at a cost of Rs 61 million, he said that the technology was introduced to 2,085 buses, but was active only in 800 buses. There was a flaw in the agreement as well and as we attempted to repair the broken system, they demanded for another Rs 8 million to which we disagreed, the Deputy Minister said.
He said that a control room for the GPS system was being constructed to control the GPS systems of buses. He also said the public could dial 1955 and receive the needed information concerning buses. He said that one of the objectives for the introduction of the technology was to provide commuters with a better service.

Four year term for heads of sports associations should prevail - Aluthgamage
The four year term of heads of sports associations should go unchanged, said Opposition Parliamentarian Mahindananda Aluthgamage in Parliament yesterday.
He said if the term was to be amended to shorten it to a period of two years, he was not commendable, as the two year period was not ample for presidents of such sports associations to render a proper service.
He made these observations joining the debate on the Regulations under the Sports Law.
Elected president take at least six months to over come the flaws, mistakes, negligence and constructive measures of his predecessor. Then he takes at least another six months to settle to work. The last six months of his term is spent working for the next election. So the period at least should be 4 years, Aluthgamage said. So I am sure the Minister has been misled by someone for amendments to reduced the term.
He also said the terms of the president of sports associations could be four years, adding that Sports Director General could come to a decision after the expiration of two years, considering the conduct of the presidents of the associations if another election was to be held or not.

Brisk walking better than jogging to combat diabetes
US: Walking briskly on a regular basis may be more effective than vigorously jogging for people with pre-diabetes, a new study has found.
The findings are the result of a six-month study of 150 participants, each of whom was designated as having pre-diabetes based on elevated fasting glucose levels.
Study participants were randomised into four groups. The first group followed an intervention modeled after the Diabetes Prevention Programme (DPP), considered a gold standard, that aims to achieve a 7 per cent body weight reduction over 6 months. The programme requires cutting calories, eating a low-fat diet, and exercising. Study participants in this group adopted the diet changes, and performed moderate-intensity exercise equivalent to 12 km of brisk walking in a week.
Other study participants were randomly assigned to receive exercise only, using different amounts and intensities - low-amount at moderate intensity (equivalent to walking briskly for 12 km per week); high-amount at moderate intensity (equivalent to walking briskly for 18.5 km per week); and high-amount at vigorous intensity (equivalent to jogging for 18.5 km per week).
We know the benefits of lifestyle changes from the DPP, but it is difficult to get patients to do even one behavior, not to mention three, said William Kraus, professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine in the US. - PTI

D. V. Upul says: I will continue to function as minister
The top preferential vote taker of Hambantota district in the Southern Province, D. V. Upul yesterday said contrary to a constitutionally permissible four-member board of ministers, the Southern Provincial Council now has a five-member board of ministers with the appointment of H. W. Gunasena as Southern Provincial Minister of Fisheries, Livestock, Environment, Electricity and Rural Industries.
Asked who the fifth is, Upul said Gunasena is the 5th minister. President Maithripala Sirisena appointed H. W. Gunasena as Southern Provincial Minister of Fisheries, Livestock, Environment, Electricity and Rural Industries yesterday, which is the portfolio held by D. V. Upul.
Upul said, I continue to function as a minister. The media had it all wrong when they said I have been removed.
He said he went to the Council yesterday and carried out his functions and even took part in the Provincial Cabinet. I have not even received a letter to the effect that I have been removed from office, he said. Asked if he liked the idea of another minister being appointed to the post held by him, Upul said, if that is what the President wanted, Gunasena is the last person I can think of as being the candidate for that portfolio under the principles of Yahaplanaya
I really think our UPFA Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera did promote his brother-in-law Gunasena because of a social issue, he said. Speaking from a democratic perspective if I was to be be removed, they could have considered other UPFA members who secured much higher votes than Gunasena in the last Southern Provincial Council Election.
Gunasena came fifth whereas I topped the list with preferential votes.
Next to me in the list of vote takers were M. K. Kasun, Ajith Rajapaksa, and Kapila Dissanayaka. H. W. Gunasena ranked lower than these candidates at the Southern Provincial poll, he pointed out.
