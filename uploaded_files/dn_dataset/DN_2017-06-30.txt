Korean Cultural Festival on July 1
The Embassy of the Republic of Korea, the National Unification Advisory Council South West Asia Chapter, the Korean Residents Association of Lanka, and the Korean Businessmens Association in Sri Lanka will hold the Korean Cultural Festival 2017 at the Bishops College Auditorium on July 1.
This is in part to celebrate the 40thanniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between Korea and Sri Lanka. A variety of programmes will be held on two separate occasions  in July and November.
The Korean Cultural Festival is organized in partnership with the Internal Affairs Ministry, Wayamba Development and Culture Affairs and the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation.
In recent years, with the growing popularity of the Korean Wave, epitomized by K-Dramas and K-Pop, many Sri Lankans including young people have shown a deep interest in Korean culture and language.
Responding to this love for Korean culture, the Embassy has organized the annual Korean Cultural Festival over the last few years.
It has proved to be a successful way to further deepen the friendship and goodwill between Korea and Sri Lanka.
The 2017 festival consists of two main events: the Quiz-on Korea and the K-Pop World Festival. The Quiz-on Korea on July 1 from 1.30 to 4 pm is a survival quiz competition where the questions will be on generic topics on Korea, including Korean lifestyle, traditional culture, history and language. The winner will be invited to learn and experience Korea this September and compete with national representatives from different countries around the world to win the top prize.
The K-Pop World Festival on July 1 from 5 pm to 7.30 pm is a K-pop performance competition, for which the Embassy has invited talented Sri Lankan vocalists and/or dancers to show their K-pop spirit on stage. Winning team(s) will stand the chance to go to Korea for the final round and compete internationally this September, following a screening process.
They will also be able to meet and perform together with K-Pop stars.
The Korea Week will start on the 40th anniversary day on November 14 and continue until November 19. During the Korea Week, the following events will take place: cultural performances of Nanta (BMICH, November 14-15), the Korean Film Festival 2017 (NFC Theatre, November 17-20), the Korean Cultural Experience Event (TBC, November 18), the Korean Language Speech Contest (TBC, November 18), an issuance of commemorative stamps (November 14), a television documentary screening on the diplomatic ties (Rupavahini TV, November 18), and the Korean Ambassadors and Kukkiwon Cup Taekwondo Championship (TBC, November 19).
Celebrating the 40th anniversary of diplomatic ties, the Korea Navy Cruise Training Task Group is also scheduled to visit Colombo Port (October 26-29).

Kusal Perera ruled out of Zim series
GALLE: Sri Lankas hard hitting wicket-keeper batsman Kusal Perera is out of the current Zimbabwe series and is even doubtful for the series against India starting later next month.
Kusal is out for the whole series against Zimbabwe. The physio says he will be out for at least 8-12 weeks. He is also touch and go for the Indian series. We will have to closely monitor him, said Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews.
Perera picked up a hamstring injury during Sri Lankas seven-wicket win against India at the Oval during the Champions Trophy in England early this month. Meanwhile Mathews stated that he will not be bowling in Test cricket but has restricted himself to only ODIs and T20Is.
I have not been given the green light to bowl. I will not be bowling in Test cricket but am looking forward to bowling in ODIs and T20Is, said Mathews. At the moment the medical teams advice is that my workload has to increase for me to start bowling again.
Mathews suffered from a calf injury ahead of the Champions Trophy opener against South Africa which he was forced to miss. He returned for the second game against India playing as a batsman. He has not bowled since his injury.

## Title: Labour shortage hits Sri Lanka's cinnamon industry

Labour shortage hits Sri Lanka's cinnamon industry
Along Sri Lanka's west coast, towns like Negombo have abundant green cinnamon farms that keep peelers of the bushes' fragrant inner bark busy. Pesthathanthri Sumathipala, a seasoned peeler, is up at dawn to lead a small crew of peelers through a 20-hectare farm. Skilled eyes are needed to choose which branches to slice for the day's harvest.
Later, he sits in a half-lit, crumbling building filled with the aroma of the spice. The sharp fragrance spreads as the 57-year-old scrapes the outer bark, massages the golden brown inner bark and then, with a sharp knife, gently teases out long strips of cinnamon to dry. "There is a lot of cinnamon to harvest, not just here but in other towns," said Sumathipala, who has been at his craft for more than 40 years, having learnt the trade from his father.
Cinnamon trails across Sri Lanka, the world's leading exporter of pure cinnamon, attest to this ample supply. But this abundance exposes a troubling picture for the South Asian island: an inability to harvest it all. Currently, Sri Lanka has an estimated 30,000 peelers to harvest 33,000 hectares of the spice -- but 50,000 would be needed to reap the entire crop during its two monsoon seasons, the ideal damp conditions for peeling.
"Due to the shortage of peelers, only 35% of the crop is harvested twice a year, while 65% of the crop is harvested once a year," said Sarada M. De Silva, chairman of the Cinnamon Training Academy, in the southern coastal town of Kosgoda. "There is a great dearth of peelers, so we cannot meet the global demand."
Research by the Institute of Policy Studies, a Colombo-based think tank, has teased out two problems that keep new crops of peelers at bay: a social stigma that continues to stain the labor force in status-conscious Sri Lankan society, and the growing diversity of the labor market, which is tempting away young workers from the traditional cinnamon-peeling families that hail from the country's southern coastal belt. "Peelers need social recognition if they are to stay on, because the whole industry depends on them," said Dilani Hirimuthugodage, co-author of an IPS study on the cinnamon trade.
Sumathipala's rough, cinnamon coated fingers explain why the peelers are indispensable. Years of practice lie behind his ability to produce the cinnamon quill, cigar-shaped and stuffed with smaller strands of the spice. The quill marks out "Ceylon cinnamon," as the island's produce is branded in world markets, in a reference to its earlier name. Industry insiders describe the peelers as an essential element in Ceylon cinnamon's pre-eminence over a cheaper global rival called "cassia cinnamon," which is grown in India, Southeast Asia and China.
"Our peelers give us an edge over other countries in the cinnamon trade," Azid bin Rafy Ismail, a cinnamon grower in Negombo, said during a walk through his farm. "You can plant and grow cinnamon anywhere that has our climate, but that matters little, since they do not have our peelers, who have learnt their art through generations, to produce the quills."
Sri Lanka's peeler shortfall coincides with a propitious time for the local cinnamon trade. The global price for the commodity has steadily increased since 2004, rising from $4 to $12 a kilo. Sri Lanka exported 13,000 tons of cinnamon valued at $159.07 million in 2016, according to the National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka, a trade body. Cinnamon export earnings amounted to $132.28 million in 2014.
Whiff of profit
The favorable global price for cinnamon, which accounts for more than half the island's spice export earnings, is driven by demand from Mexico, Peru, Colombia and the United States, the top importers of Ceylon cinnamon. The Mexican market demands five-inch cinnamon quills, said Nalin Anura De Silva, director of G.D. De Silva Sons, a cinnamon exporter in the southern coastal town of Ahungalla. "We trade mainly with South America. They like our pure cinnamon," he said.
Not surprisingly, the whiff of profit that cinnamon offers has resulted in the spread of cinnamon farms. It has also encouraged farmers who formerly grew other crops to try their hands at growing the fragrant spice. Consequently, state employed agriculture extension officers in Negombo have their work cut out -- providing cinnamon seedlings and advice to the new growers. "Word has spread about good cinnamon prices, and more people in Negombo want to grow it," said Madhushika Hansanee, an agriculture officer, who dispenses advice every Wednesday. "We gave free cinnamon seedlings till 2015, but last year we introduced a 50% subsidy for the seedlings."
Sri Lanka, which exports 85% of its cinnamon harvest, has witnessed a steady rise in its annual output, from 15,900 tons in 2006 to 17,707 tons in 2015. Nearly 80% of the producers are small farmers strung along the western and southern coastal belts, which have long produced the spice, which is indigenous to the island. Stories are still told in some corners of southern Sri Lanka of the role played by cinnamon in attracting Portuguese colonists 1505. The Portuguese were followed by Dutch and British colonial administrations.
The cinnamon farms spread across the southern coastal belt are a mark of the growers' resilience, too. Many of the farms were flattened by the 2004 tsunami, which killed 31,000 people across Sri Lanka and damaged large swathes of its coastal agriculture. The sector is now expected to grow by 5% annually, according to local growers, who had to wait four years after replanting to enjoy profitable harvests. Yet the peelers required to hit higher production targets remain lacking.
Sarada De Silva, chairman of the Cinnamon Training Academy, is crafting one remedy. Since January, the academy has begun training locals in an attempt to increase the stock of new peelers, hoping to overcome the social stigma that has been the bane of the sector. "There is an interest in the academy because our training is seen positively," De Silva said.
He admited that the academy's efforts will take time to bear fruit. But that problem has not troubled the Sri Lankan government, which is in a rush to expand the national income. In March, it announced an ambitious plan to double the island's cinnamon exports by 2020. Daya Gamage, the Minister of Primary Industries, is eyeing a record $300 million in cinnamon export earnings by that year. "Who is going to peel" asked Sumathipala, more grounded in the production chain of the Sri Lankan spice than the minister. "Even my son doesn't like to be a peeler," he said, wiping sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand.

Lanka aiming for maximum  a clean sweep
Five-match ODI series v Zimbabwe commences today:
GALLE: Sri Lanka will be leaving no stone unturned by trying to make a clean 5-0 sweep of the five-match one-day international series against low ranked Zimbabwe which commences at the Galle International Stadium today, and grab maximum points to lift themselves off the precarious position of eighth in the ICC ODI rankings.
Sri Lanka cannot afford to drop further than that because it would mean they will have to qualify to play in the 2019 Cricket World Cup.
A clean sweep of the series would see them rise to either seventh or sixth displacing Bangladesh or the newly crowned Champions Trophy winners Pakistan.
We dont want to take Zimbabwe lightly if we can win 5-0 it will be good but we are not thinking too far ahead but taking one game at a time, said Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews at the pre-match press conference yesterday.
The outcome of a 5-0 win would be ideal but youve got to play good cricket to beat the Zimbabweans even if it is in our home conditions. We have not played an ODI at Galle since 2000, it is exciting to play here but our main objective is to win the game, he said.
Although Sri Lanka are playing a low ranked team like Zimbabwe, Mathews said the intensity levels will not drop.
When we prepare for a series it doesnt really matter whether we are playing Australia or Zimbabwe we train to our maximum and we will try and not think about the opposition too much but think about how we can improve as a team, said Mathews.
Tactically combinations might change a little bit but not too much. We will look to play according to the conditions but whoever we play we will play our best combination to win.
Mathews said that Sri Lanka was working towards a settled team and they would try and minimize changes to it as far as possible.
Consistency is something we are looking and we saw it in the Champions Trophy where we didnt meddle with the batting order too much. It is one aspect that we are not trying to experiment too much, said Mathews.
We will try and go with at least 6-8 batters in the next few months. There could be one or two changes due to injuries or depending on the form. When it comes to the bowlers we play a lot of cricket. We want to manage the workloads of the fast bowlers and also with the spinners. Its not easy to play a lot of games continuously, he said.
Fielding has been a key issue with the Lankan team and Mathews said, Fielding is an individual thing. If you had a look at the last two training sessions the boys were sweating it out. We are working extremely hard, one or two catches will be dropped anyway and in the future as well. No one goes to a game thinking to drop a catch but unfortunately we do mistakes and we will still do mistakes. We have to minimize it by working extremely hard.
Mathews said Sri Lankas combination for the match depended on the pitch they would get and on the conditions under which they will have to play. Despite the constant rains in Colombo, Galle was bright and sunny yesterday allowing both teams to get a full work out for todays game.

Lanka Salt turns profitable with  self sufficiency target by 2020
Lanka Salt Limited plans to make Sri Lanka a self sufficient nation in salt by 2020, said its Chairman, Ayyoob Khan.
Speaking at a special event at Lanka Salt he said several new measures have been taken in the last two years to increase production and efficiency. He said that during the last two and half years they introduced new salt fields in their three salterns, in Hambantota, Bundala and Palatupana and also deep tanks have also been established.
Khan said a new plant was established and also age old machinery wwere retired and new machines, vehicles and equipment introduced. The Chairman said that plans were under way to introduce new products such as Vacuum salt to the market in additional to industrial and Lak Lunu brands.
The new products would be ready by 2019, he said. Lanka Salt is an ISO certified company and their salterns are spread in a total area of 2,600 acres. The institution has 90% of shares with ETF and 10% with employees who account to over 1,000. The Chairman said that when the new board was appointed in March 2016 they found that in the past years salt has been sold for less than cost. This has resulted in heavy losses and the new Board decided to increase the prices and also appointed agents all over the country for better distribution. Today we have a total of 66 agents and the distribution is streamlined, he said. According to data total consumption of local salt is 150, 000 metric tons including 120,000 for domestic and rest for industrial. Sri Lankas Salt harvest up to 2017 October is expected to be 85,000 MT and by end 2018 we hope to increase this to 11, 000 MT and keep on the momentum and gradually increase to meet Sri Lanka demand for 2020. Lanka Salt, Vice Chairman, Keerthi Munasinghe said that the total debt of the institution in 2015 was Rs. 33.5 million.
In the following year we turned it around and paid Rs. 465 million to the government as tax. Lanka Salt earned a profit of Rs. 260 million last year and we also managed to have a fixed deposit of Rs. 500 million.
In addition we also released Rs. 180 million to the ETF and a further Rs. 20 million to our employees, he said.

LWMF new initiatives
The Lionel Wendt Memorial Fund (LWMF) announced a number of exciting initiatives, for local and international audiences, aimed at raising awareness about its unique art collection.
The LWMF was established in 1948 with the purpose of perpetuating the legacy of Lionel Wendt (1900 -1944); it will celebrate its 70th anniversary in 2018 and is the only officially elected non-profit organisation in the world assigned to look after Wendts legacy and his collection of artworks. Wendt was one of the founding members of the 43 Group, Sri Lankas first Modernist collective of artists formed in 1943 in Colombo. Though his name needs no introduction to audiences in Sri Lanka, perhaps many may not be familiar with the extraordinary body of work he produced as a photographer. Made in the 1930s at a time when photography was a relatively new art form, his prints are some of the most important works in the history of photography. Wendt is indisputably a figure of major national and international interest, whose legacy lies in a magnificent body of work that he left behind after his premature death in 1944. The original LWMF collection is the single largest collection of work by Lionel Wendt. Alongside Wendts own photographs, the collection also includes key examples of work by other artists in the group, such as W.J.G Beling (1907-1977), Aubrey Collette (1920-1992), and George Keyt (1901-1993).
For many years the LWMF has recognised that its collection has significant educational and cultural value. At the same time, it recognised that finding expertise and resources, in addition to assessing the condition of the collection, were priorities that needed to be addressed first. For the last 18 months, the Trust has been working with the acclaimed international curator Sharmini Pereira in the role of Chief Curator, Collections and is delighted to announce that Pereira and her team has recently completed the first phase of an extensive cataloguing process. The research has revealed many new insights about Wendts work and provides the starting point for the LWMFs program over the next five years.
To this end, plans are in development to show part of the collection as a permanent exhibit, giving visitors to the Lionel Wendt Art Centre an unprecedented opportunity to look at and study Wendts work within a dedicated gallery space. A parallel project includes the creation of the largest digital image archive of Wendts work, including documents and information related to his career and life. A picture library of images for reproduction purposes will be made available to those wishing to use images of Lionel Wendts work for scholarly, educational or critical purposes. Image requests will be handled in line with international standards for image rights and accreditation.
A series of publications and events about Wendts unique legacy are also being developed with scholars and curators. All these initiatives draw from works in the LWMFs collection, which currently contains over 350 photographs by Lionel Wendt. Although it is the largest official collection of his work, the original collection is estimated to have included over 1500 photographs.
Reassembling the collection, as a digital archive, is of utmost importance if Wendts work is to be comprehensively studied and enjoyed.
The Trust will be making every effort to contact those who believe they own work so that it can be documented. The creation of such a learning resource will not only be the largest of its kind but will also be of national interest, establishing Lionel Wendts place in the history of photography and as part of Sri Lankas cultural heritage.

NOC objects to selection of more boxers for Commonwealth Games
The National Olympic Committee has objected to the suggestions made by the Boxing Association of Sri Lanka to pick 12 boxers for the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia 2017 as Sri Lanka will be fielding only 55 competitors for the games.
At a meeting held at the Sports Ministry presided over by Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara, the President of the Boxing Association of Sri Lanka (ABASL) Dian Gomes has suggested that more boxers should be included in the squad as they have a good chance of winning medals, but the secretary of the NOC Maxwell de Silva has said that they should not be given preference as Sri Lanka has received only 55 slots compared to 104 at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2014.
De Silva has pointed out that in recent Commonwealth games weightlifters, athletes and pistol shooters have won more medals than boxers so that boxers should not be given preferential treatment.
Although Manju Wanniarachchi won a gold medal in Bantamweight 56 kg category at the 2010 Commonwealth games in New Delhi by beating Wales Shane McGoldrick he was disqualified later as he was found guilty of taking performance enhancing drugs.
Four years later in Glasgow games except for Anuruddha Ratnayake, Maduranga Pathirage and Shiromala Wickremesinghe all other boxers were knocked out in the first round. In the 2014 games, all ten boxers who represented Sri Lanka could not win a single medal but the President of BASL Dian Gomes said that this year at least five boxers could win medals for Sri Lanka in Gold Coast, Australia.
The Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera has given instructions to select all the competitors by September, 2017 for the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast in Australia so that they can be given training by foreign coaches in preparation for the games.

PAFFREL to receive MP dual citizen list
Immigration and Emigration Department officials have informed Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) that they would be able to provide the names of Members of Parliament who are holders of dual citizenship and the relevant details of such citizenships within the next two to three weeks, PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Centre for Society and Religion (CSR), Hettiarachchi said that PAFFREL asked the Department of Immigration and Emigration to provide the names of Members of Parliament who are holding dual citizenship. This request was made under Section 12 of the Right to Information Bill.
The Court verdict and order regarding a certain female MP should apply to all other parliamentarians too, he said.
The PAFFREL Executive Director expressed his gratitude to the Immigration and Emigration Department for its positive response to the request.

Paradigm of entrepreneurship has changed - Binod Chaudhary
As much as making money was important to businessmen it was of paramount importance to work with the society to redistribute it back, opined Binod K. Chaudhary Chairman, CG Corp Global, Nepal speaking at the 178th AGM of Ceylon Chamber of Commerce yesterday at Cinnamon Grand Colombo.
As businessmen, making money is important to us. But more important than that is how we work with society in giving it back. We cannot function in a vacuum. We have a big responsibility towards our society. We all need to fulfill that responsibility. Otherwise, our earning money will be useless. For many of us, making money may be easy. But it is difficult using that money wisely toward helping our societies. Let us ask ourselves do we want to be remembered asrich and mean businessmen or rich and compassionate human beings he queried.
Chaudhary said that Bill Gates was known as the richest man of the world. But he was equally know for running a foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, that is doing so much on public health around the world.
In India, we all know the Tatas for being one of the biggest conglomerates, but we remember them even better for their fantastic social service in the fields of cancer treatment. It gives me tremendous sense of satisfaction to share that within a period of less than six months we built 3000 transitional homes and 40 school buildings after the earthquake in Nepal, said.
Looking back 20 years, one could see the predominance of traditional manufacturing industries. The capital-centric traditional industries such as textile, jute, sugar and steel used to rule the market. Those days have now ended, he said. The paradigm of entrepreneurship has changed. Trendy Youtubers are compelling traditional television broadcasters to rethink their survival, teenage Instagram stars are becoming case studies for marketing gurus. To be an entrepreneur, we need two things: an innovative idea and a strong will to execute. It does not matter what citizenship or passport you carry.
The national boundaries no longer hold any relevance if your will power is strong enough, Chaudhary added.

Since the new government came to power in 2015, President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe proceeded to set the country on a transformative path in terms of good governance, rule of law, justice, reconciliation and economic development, to safeguard every citizens rights; irrespective of ethnicity, race, religion, gender, language, class or social status, said the Deputy Speaker.

Parliamentarians performance on website soon

Information Systems and Management Director of Parliament Mahesh Perera said today that a new features will be added to the Parliament official website to enable users to analyze the performances of Parliamentarians.
He said that this initiative was taken under the open Parliament concept adopted by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
As the first step the attendance of MPs on regular Parliament sittings and committees will be accessible to the public via website he said.
Until now referring old records via the website was done manually. With the new features we are hoping to add shortly, these records can be automatically searched and sorted out using an Application Programming Interface. This type of software is already being used in websites such as Manthri.lk which keeps tab on the performances of MPs, he explained.
However, adressing on the constraints in feeding quantitative data he said the attendance sheets only mean that the MPs are present during the sittings, and it does not reflect the level of their active or productive contribution during the debates or committee meetings.
Making an appearance of five minutes is enough to get the daily payment of Rs 2,500 for attending Parliament sittings. How many hours he spent at the chamber or in how many committees he actively participated does not get counted and this is an issue the public raises, Perera explained.
In the future, we will make all information in Parliament available to the public to the maximum degree we can. Transparency is a key pillar in good governance and we will do our best to uphold it, he said.

Those who plunder State property and lead luxurious lives will taste prison rice in the near future, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development and Mahaweli Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
He said so addressing a meeting at the resident project managers office at Embilipitiya.
The minister was on an inspection tour in the Mahaweli zone area.
The minister said some State officials who plundered State property have already lost their jobs. He said State property is similar to poojas for the Maha Sangha.
Plundered State property will be confiscated, he said adding that he had the opportunity to glance through several files of a corrupt Mahaweli official and found that he sold billions of rupees worth Mahaweli land. His services had been terminated.
The minister added that the person had asked a certain businessman to provide him his BMW car because he had given him land over the value of the car.
Such corrupt officials will be dealt with severely according to law, he said.
Some people ask whether we have nabbed corrupt officials and politicians. This cannot be done in a haphazard manner. We have to follow the rules and regulations. The custodians of law will look into it, the minister said.

Political unwillingness delays LG polls: PAFFREL
Political unwillingness has resulted in the delay of holding Local Government (LG) election, PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said yesterday.
He said technical issues pertaining to the holding of LG polls have been sorted out.
The election could be held within 75 days of the Amendment Bill being passed in Parliament, he said. Hettiarachchi said the decision on holding the election is up to Parliament.
Parliamentarians should fulfil their duty by demanding to hold the election soon, he said.
Hettiarachchi said the previous regime too responsible for delaying the LG polls since the technical issues pertaining to the holding of LG polls were reported to the Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry in 2013.
He said the former leaders tried to manipulate the peoples right by holding elections in segments. But postponing the election is worse than that, he said.
The government cannot postpone the Provincial Council Election.
They have to go for a referendum to postpone the election, he said.

The strike launched by the postal workers ended yesterday night following discussions between members of the Joint Postal Trade Unions Front,Post Master General and the Postal Services Ministry Secretary.
The Joint Postal Trade Unions Front Co-Convenor Chinthaka Bandara said the unions had decided to end the strike as authorities had responded positively to the demands put forward by the Trade Unions Front.
We have already communicated our decision to JPTUF membership islandwide and postal services will re-commence from 6 am today he added..
However, Bandara said the unions may resort to trade union action again after two weeks if authorities fail to uphold their promises.
The strike launched by postal workers dragged on for three days and crippled postal services islandwide whilst severely inconveniencing the public.
The strike action by the Joint Postal Trade Unions Front with the support of several other postal trade unions is based on three main demands.
Workers are demanding to halt the redevelopment plan to convert the Nuwara-Eeliya, Kandy and Galle Fort Post Offices to profit making ventures and they also seek solutions to administrative issues faced by the staff due to a circular issued in 2006.

He also said President Maithripala Sirisena has paid attention to solving the issues of dairy farmers. He added that on the request of dairy farmers, discussions will be held with the subject minister to open the new Ambewela dairy factory within a month.
Bandara also pointed out that the Nestle Company has also promised to buy more milk from dairy farmers as a solution to their issue.
Bandara also said that the suggestion by the dairy farmers to increase the tax on imported milk powder would also be considered following the opening of the Ambewela factory.
He was speaking at a media briefing following a discussion with dairy farmer representatives, office bearers of All Island Dairy Farmers Association and All Ceylon Farmers Federation and local producers held at the Presidents Secretariat, to deal with the issues faced by the stake holders of the dairy industry.
Bandara also pointed out that there were many issues faced by the dairy farmers and producers. He added that 8.5 lts. of milk is needed to produce 1 kg of milk powder. He added that the producers incur a loss of Rs.235 in milk powder production and they could reduce the loss to Rs.160 with the concession of Rs.75 given to each litre of milk.
All Ceylon FarmersFederation Vice Chairman Susantha Kumara Nawaratne said that they were given an assurance at the meeting that they would be given an opportunity to discuss the matter with the President. He also said that the farmers face a number of issues in their industry.
Nawaratne also pointed out that although the tax on milk powder import has been reduced, the tax should be increased and imports should be limited in order to solve the issues of the dairy farmers and factories. He also pointed out that nearly 1.25 million litres of milk had been wasted during the last three weeks due to these unsolved issues.

President's idea to solve garbage issue better than Champika's: Tissa

Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP)Leader Tissa Vitharana said that they request President Maithripala Sirisena to go ahead with his plan to solve the garbage issue in the country without giving in to Megapolis and Western Province Development Minister Champika Ranawakas idea.
Addressing a press conference held at the LSSP Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday he said that the President planned to use the bio-technical method to solve the garbage issue while Megapolis Minister planed to solve the issue by transporting garbage to Puttalam and dumping in pits.
According to Prof. Vitharana, the president's method saves money while offering several benefits to the country.
There is no need to transport garbage from one place to another but Minister Ranawakas plan will create another environmental issue with the time being. Transporting garbage to Puttalam is costly he said.
The Minister says that those who oppose President Sirisenas idea will be traitors of the country and his plan will be implemented from 2019.

Previous regime halted low income housing projects - PM
Middle class and low income housing projects had come to a standstill at the time the National Government led by President Maithripala Sirisena assumed power, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister opened the Lakhiru Sevana housing complex at Maligawatta on Wednesday.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the previous government laid emphasis on building apartments for the rich and the capitalist class. He said the immediate challenge before the national government was to seek funds to activate stalled housing projects. Lakhiru Sevana housing complex is one such project, said said.
The Prime Minister said the Government hoped to complete 6,000 houses under a project launched with funds raised by the NHDA and partly provided by the State. He said the government promised to develop the Colombo City. It was involved in the process of finding funds.
He said the government proposed to build flats to house shanty drivellers and utilise the land on which they had lived for other urban development programmes.
The Prime Minister said the NHDA was responsible for maintaining white elephants like the Hambantota Conference Hall. The government was tasked with the responsibility of repaying loans obtained for building such white elephants, he said.
The Government devoted the last two years towards strengthening the countrys economy. The government was not in a position to repay even the interests on loans let alone repaying loan instalments early 2015. The government changed the situation. The country has the ability to repay loans, he said.
He said several other housing schemes similar to the Lakhiru Sevana housing scheme were being built through out the country. The programme included the middle class and rural housing schemes, the re-settlement housing projects in the North and the plantation housing scheme, he said.

PUCSL asks CEB for 12 new power plant combinations
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) asked the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to develop 12 new scenarios which will provide different power plant combinations.
PUCSL said, these scenarios should be developed with updated prices for coal, natural gas and oil and with the cost of externalities (Social and environmental costs) and should be submitted together with input data.
We carried out an in-depth study on the proposed Least Cost Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan 2018-2037 prepared by CEB and analysed the comments and proposals that key stakeholders made during our public consultation process, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka Director General Damitha Kumarasinghe said.
Taking all that into the account, PUCSL requested 12 new scenarios to be submitted apart from the plant combination recommended in the plan, so that the nation can be ensured that every option is studied and best 20 year power plant plan is given approval. PUCSL instructed CEB to use the electricity demand forecast on the recommended power plant combination (Base case) in the proposed Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP) 2018-2037 to develop these new scenarios and to do away with the assumption that pump storage plants are mandatory.
However, PUCSL stressed not to include the cost of terminal/floating storage regasification unit (FSRU), and jetty costs in the capital cost of gas fired plants, but to incorporate those costs to the fuel cost component of those plants in developing these new scenarios.
Considering all the requirements, CEB is directed,
1) To build a scenario applying the last three months average price of the year 2016 for new coal and supercritical plants, the average price of the last quarter 2016 for natural gas and the same for oil without externalities cost that will generate a power plant combination for 20 years.
2) To build a scenario applying the average price of the year 2016 of new coal and supercritical plants, natural gas and oil without externalities cost that will generate a power plant combination for 20 years.
3) To build a scenario applying the average cost of the year 2016 for new coal and supercritical plants and Oil but use the price of USD 8.3/MMBtu for Natural Gas recommended by the Petroleum Research Development Secretariat without externalities cost that will generate a power plant combination for 20 years.
4) To build all the above-mentioned three scenarios, including the externalities cost by taking environmental costs and social damage cost in to accounts which will generate three different power plant combinations for 20 years.
5) To build aforesaid six scenarios under additional constraint of no future coal power plant additions that will generate six different power plant combinations for 20 years.
The three-month average prices of 2016 for Coal, Natural Gas and Oil, one-year average prices for the same and references to the prices were communicated to CEB in order to expedite the process.
Clarifications were also requested from CEB on the references of the studies that are mentioned in the submitted 20-year generation expansion plan, implementation of the first 10 years of the base case plan, specification of the coal proposed for new coal and super critical coal plants, cost details for pump storage hydro power plant etc. This information was asked to be produced on or before July 7, while another set of clarification that includes varying topics that generated through public consultation asked to be produced to PUCSL on or before July 14.
The LCLTGEP has been compiled based on the results of the latest electricity expansion planning studies conducted by the CEB for the planning period of 2018-2037 and aims to cater the forecasted demand growth by identifying the least cost plant addition sequence based on the most sustainable technology to avoid electricity shortfalls in the country.
The plan has been submitted to PUCSL for the approval and PUCSL held a written and oral public consultation to receive key stakeholder comments, proposals and views on the 20-year electricity generation plan.
PUCSL will announce the decision on the LCLTGEP on 20th July 2017.

Racism is a colonial hangover
We are committed to all citizens being equal:
I am going by the data given to me by the Police:
I was misquoted:
PTA will not be Repealed in full:
Minister of Justice and Buddha Sasana Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe in an interview with the Daily News spoke on the recent controversy involving him and issues pertaining to minorities among others.
Q: In a recent interview with the BBC, you said that there were "four minor incidents" (sulu siduweem) regarding attacks on Churches.
A: Not attacks. I meant incidents some of which were issues among themselves.
Q: But there is documented evidence that it is beyond that. For instance, 100 villagers attacked and destroyed the Kithusewana Church in Karuwalagaswewa on June 9th this year. A Church in Ingiriya was vandalized on May 29, 2016. The Assembly of Christ Church in Veyangoda was attacked on June 26. The Jeewanadiya Church in Moragahahena was attacked and the list goes on and on. There is so much of documented incidents of these types of attacks. How are you saying it is 4
A: You cant say its documented. There are no two Police services in Sri Lanka. Police are not maintained in Churches. We have only one Police Department in Sri Lanka. I am speaking of the relevant period that is after January 8, 2015. There are only 4 incidents in Police records. There is nothing more than these 4 incidents in Police records and I have shown in to the people.
Q: But the National Christian Evangelical Alliance of Sri Lanka and other groups which include minority rights groups both local and international, are saying that there have been more and that they are documented and that there have been complaints made in Police stations
A: Let them produce the list. I have produced a list of four. If there are other incidents which occurred during that period, they could submit the list and point out that I was wrong. I got the official report from the Police and most of these publications on websites and social media are run by various NGO people and they know how to make money by providing these details. In fact, there have been 15 or 16 incidents against Muslims, 13 or 14 against Buddhists, 1 against Hindus and no incidents against the Catholic Church.
Q: But again, you do know that there is an ideological difference between the Catholic Church and these
A: it is not a matter for us. When we have to implement the law and render justice, we have to apply the same law. I am sure you agree.
Q: I am reading this report Mr. Rajapakshe ' Confronting intolerance; Continued violations against religious minorities in Sri Lanka' by Minority Rights Group International.
A: That is some rubbish group. Why cant they bring the official statement made to the Police and produce it
Q: But...
A: What is the use of putting these up on websites
Q: Are you categorically saying that there were only 4 attacks
A: Not attacks, just incidents.
Q: Are you categorically saying that it was only 4
A: Yes, during the relevant period. Correct.
Q: Let me move on. In an interview published today (on Thursday) in a local newspaper, you specifically said with regard to the hate speech coming from a monk, you said that you agree with the view expressed by the Asgiriya Chapter. That you agree in the substance of the hate speech, but it is the conduct that you object to
A: No, that is not about incidents or anything like that. That was about their (Asgiriya chapter) statement about the purported takeover of the control of the Rangiri Dambulu Viharaya. It was not about the conduct of the monk or about anything regarding the incidents.
Q: Right...
A: I think they have apparently got it mixed up. I being the Minister of Buddha Sasana, I had to clarify the legal position of the temples to have their own control.
Q: So Mr. Minister, to clarify, the sentiment expressed by the Asgiriya Chapter which said that although the conduct of the monk is deplorable, there is substance to the sentiments. Don't you stand with that
A: I dont want to get involved in that controversy, that is their opinion. But I know and I speak with personal experience that the issues had arisen as a failure of the Archaeological Department. When there is an archaeological site, it is the duty of the department to preserve them. When they dont do it people may encroach. That is the normal nature. And in certain places once identified, we made arrangements to preserve them. But still the Venerable Monks say that there are some more places. In fact, even the Minister was not satisfied with the conduct of the Director General and interdicted him. I think the issue the monks are raising is linked to the failure to preserve these archaeological sites.
Q: But Mr. Minister, we have had close to 30 Muslim owned businesses attacked, we have Christian groups and minorities saying that there is a rise of extremism coming from the majority community and you are the Minister of Buddha Sasana.
A: There are no 30 incidents of attacks on Mosques or Muslim Institutions. There are only 16. I can provide you the list.
Q: But this list
A: You can't go by lists on websites. I can provide you the list which have been given to me by the Police. According to it, there have been only 16 incidents.
Q: Are you saying 16 between April and June 2017
A: No I am saying 16 from January 8, 2015.
Q: Are you saying only 16 incidents have been reported 
A: I will give you the list, if you say I am wrong, you can show me how. I have got the official details from the Police. I am not the one doing calculations and investigations. I vehemently condemn any act of violence against any religious place or institution. It is the duty of the State to protect them. But one thing you may have to realize is that I am not going to compare and say they didn't take action and we have taken action and give out a foolish argument, but the fact is that except with regard to one or two incidents, the Police have taken action in all such cases. Suspects have been arrested, produced and the cases are pending.
Q: Except when it came to the main suspect, who dramatically was given bail in three cases on the same day, including an arrest warrant being withdrawn.
A: I can't comment on it because it is the conduct of the Court. We are not controlling the Courts. Bail is a discretion of the Judge. So it is not something I can comment on. We cant take the responsibility concerning the conduct of the Court. I also think that our people have a wrong attitude about bailin their minds. I am not referring to this particular case, but in general, there is a notion that when there is a charge, a suspect must be kept until the case is over. That is not the law. In 1996, the new Bail Act came in. The rule is you shall grant bail, the exception is to refuse.
Q: To take you to the focal point, Mr. Lakshan Dias commented on these incidents in his capacity I believe as an activist. What right does the Minister of Justice have to call for his debarring
A: Not in my capacity as Minister of Justice, but as a citizen of this country. He said 195 Christian churches had been attacked, he reaffirmed. Then the compere said "you are going to burn this country and asked are you taking the responsibility" (to the figures). He said yes.
Q: But he is quoting from figures...
A: You can't quote from various places and make statements on live TV. The following morning there can be mayhem. You are trying to burn the whole country. You as a citizen of this country, would you ever say 195 mosques have been attacked without proper proof
Q: But Minister the NCEASL was established in 1952 and since the 1990s, they have been cataloguing data. This data has been used...
A: No you are wrong. He said it was after January 8, 2015.
Q: Yes...
A: You give me the data since then. They have become a nuisance to the Catholic community. The first thing they have encroached upon are the Catholic people. They dont come behind Buddhists or Muslims, because it isn't easy. The easiest catch for them are the Catholics and they are fighting against the Catholics.
Q: Right. So Mr. Minister you are aware of this ideological difference. Do you agree that it is futile to ask the Cardinal to verify this data Do you understand that
A: No, it is not futile. As far as this country is concerned, the most respected and responsible religious dignitary be it for the Christians and the Catholics, as far at the State is concerned is the Archbishop of Colombo. You cant underestimate what the Archbishop says. He is speaking with responsibility
Q: But it is perceived as a threat what you said to a member of your profession...
A: There is no threat. People have already complained to the Supreme Court. If you are jeopardizing the interests of the entire nation or create a destruction or arouse communal tension and create what happened in 1983, a man like that - do you think he wants to protect human rights
Q: With regard to the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), you spoke of this today as well ( at a preceding press conference), what is you stance on it
A: We are still studying it. Because even last week the British Prime Minister had tightened their law. The detention period has increased. When there is a threat the country has to react accordingly. Now the situation around the world has changed. The situation which prevailed in January, 2015 and now has changed and we have to take into consideration the proposals, depending on the situation arising within the country and in the world, we may have to change our stance.
Q: So there is not going to be a repeal
A: Even if we are going to repeal it, that doesnt mean it is going to be totally done away with. On one hand we are trying to restrict abuse and on the other hand we are trying to widen it to cover international issues which are happening or linked to those activities, which may cause a threat to the country.
Q: As an intellectual, do you not see that there is a dissonance between your government and the majority community That this dissonance that had come up during the last two years, is because this government had failed to identify themselves with the Sinhalese Buddhist national ethos. Isn't this what gives rise and help perpetuate what we are witnessing today
A: No, I dont think so. In fact, when we came into power in January 2015 you know the situation we had in this country. You had no freedom to talk to me like this and even if you did, you wont be able to publish it. During this period, we have established free media, the right to expression, we have established the Right to Information among many others. This is not due to our failure, but due to some unfortunate issues which we have to find out what the causes are and what resulted in this. It is very unfortunate that some people are trying to rile up communal feelings in the country.
Q: Let me ask you this once again, isn't there a massive feeling of despondency among the majority community, which results in this
A: No, you cant say that. Extremists are there in all communities.
Q: No I am not talking about extremists. Leave out the extremists. I'm talking about the masses of this country who feel that this government is not representative of the Sinhalese Buddhist ethos.
A: Yes, there is that allegation. There is this allegation within the Sinhalese Buddhist community. There are isolated incidents which takes place. We concede that this type of thing happens. We dont tolerate them. But in all such cases, except one or two, action had been taken in all the cases. In fact, after a lengthy discussion between the President and the Prime Minister and all the senior Cabinet Ministers, we suggested that the Police OIC must take full responsibility and he must take care of the security in the area and dedicate himself and prevent such crimes.
Q: But you aren't answering my question. The feeling that this Government is run by the elite which is distanced from the average Sinhalese Buddhists - isn't that one of the causes the government is unable to react
A: I answered this question before. Yes there is this feeling among certain sections. You are correct.
Q: And what would you do about this
A: The first is to educate them. I am pleading with them to think as Sri Lankans. It is an attitude issue. I plead with them to look at everyone as equals, to shed away these personal identities. Even India had gone so far was because they go on grounds of a national identity and not ethnic and other identities. In fact at a recent interview I showed a Phd Research by Jane Russel, an English lady titled 'Communal Politics in Sri Lanka under the Donoughmore Constitution.' I think it is a very important book for all journalists to read. With her wisdom, the book was written in the 70's or 80's. She has said that nationalists in Sri Lanka is equal to racism. That is because the foundation of democracy was laid by the British in 1911 with this intention ( of Communal differences) and they wanted it to be there. And to have representatives in the Legislative Council on communal basis. Unfortunately in 1948, although the system was done away with, the attitudes haven't changed.

SL upgraded in State Department watchlist
Sri Lanka has been upgraded to  Tier 2 from its previous Tier 2 watchlist status by the United States, State Department in its most recent rankings on human trafficking.
Addressing a specially convened media conference at the Justice Ministry, Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said that the upgrade ensured that the country would continue to receive aid and other benefits.
We were on the watchlist for 4 years and faced the status of being downgraded. If that happened it would have directly impacted non humanitarian aid the country received from the United States, IMF allocations and other such benefits he said.
He said that the Government has taken steps in conjuction with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Law and Order and other institutions to ensure that Sri Lanka has taken steps to deter human trafficking.
In the year commencing April 1st 2016 to March 31st 2017 we have filed 35 cases and 7 persons were convicted for the offence, he said.
Speaking at the briefing, SSP Ajith Rohana said that Human Smuggling and trafficking although distinct as offenses are interrelated.
Even in cases where people volountarily seek to leave the country by illegal means, there is abuse, when they are not provided with what they signed up for he said.
He said the Police department has taken all possible measures to educate the public against falling prey to illegal acts involving trafficking and smuggling. Justice Ministry Secretary Padmasiri Jayamanna said that the Australian Government had assured funds to be directed toward educating the public.
As a result the Attorney Generals Department is in the process of educating public servants. A recent conference was held with the participation of 600 District Secretaries across the Island to educate the public on the issue he said. Rajapakshe said that the effort was spearheaded through a task force with the participation of key departments and ministries, which ensured that the law has been upheld and deterrence was encouraged.
This is modern day slavery and the government has taken all effort to combat it, he said.

Sri Lankas economy  to grow over 5% - WB
Sri Lankas growth is expected to reach 4.7% percent in 2017 and grow marginally over 5 % beyond, driven by private consumption and investment growth, said Idah Z. Pswarayi-Riddihough, World Bank County Director for Sri Lanka and Maldives.
Speaking at the latest Sri Lanka Development Update (SLDU) of the World Bank she said that although the short to medium term growth will continue to be driven by non-tradable sectors, successful implementation of reforms should help the country to rely on productive tradable sectors in the long run.
Inflation will pick up towards upper single digit level in the first half of 2017 because of past high monetary growth along with the increase of VAT collection. However, the base-effect will see inflation stabilizing around mid-single digit level towards the end of 2017.
Low international commodity prices, though gradually increasing, will help maintain the downward pressure. In the medium term, the announced shift by the Central Bank to flexible inflation targeting will keep inflation in the single digits, while the exchange rate is left to adjust to market forces. Sri Lankan Government led reforms to improve competitiveness, maintain macro-fiscal stability and strengthen institutions, with broad support in the country, are key to robust economic growth, job creation and poverty reduction. She said that the lack of variety in Sri Lankas export basket is a grave area of concern and the regaining of General System of Preferences Plus (GSP+) is a good area to focus on.
The fiscal deficit narrowed from 7.6 percent in 2015 to 5.4 percent of GDP in 2016.
The real GDP growth for 2016 slowed to 4.4 percent, as sustained drought took a toll on the agriculture sector.
The Government of Sri Lankas efforts has strengthened growth performance. However, extreme weather among other factors, has hindered the execution of the budget and impacted economic growth and exports performance she added.
While robust contributions from construction and financial services sectors is a good sign, Sri Lanka needs to continue to take forward its reform agenda if it is to adequately boost revenues and provide its people with more and better jobs.

Sri Lanka, India to set up solar unit soon
Sri Lanka will soon kick-start the setting up of a solar power plant in Trincomalee after discussions with India.
The next step would be to undertake a feasibility study and do the groundwork, spokesman for the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry Sulakshana Jayawardena told The Hindu on Wednesday. In April this year, the Sri Lankan and Indian Governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding, for cooperation in a host of development projects, including the setting up of a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant in suburban Colombo and a solar power plant in Sampur, Trincomalee.
We have a land to set up the 50 MW solar plant envisaged in the MoU.
We have to work out executing of the project, in consultation with India, Jayawardena said.
Sri Lanka had initially planned to set up a coal power plant in Sampur, through an international joint venture with Indias National Thermal Power Corporation.
In September 2016, the Power Ministry scrapped the project citing environmental concerns.
A month later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met President Maithripala Sirisena in Goa, on the side-lines of the BRICS summit, where he flagged the possibility of New Delhi partnering Colombo in LNG and green energy projects.

SriLankan wins right to run duty free operation
Commercial High Court, Colombo, Ruwan Fernando on June 23, refused the Interim Injunctions sought by DFP Canada Ltd against SriLankan Airlines Ltd. The Court also dissolved the enjoining orders previously issued.
DFP Canada Ltd (DFP) filed action claiming that DFP was the actual company behind the highly controversial Phoenix Duty Free Services (Phoenix) and that DFP had a right of first refusal and right to match an offer under the Supply and Concessionaire Agreement granted to Phoenix Duty Free Services in 2012 in violation of standard tender procedures of SriLankan Airlines.
The Report of the Board of Inquiry headed by J.C.Weliamuna, PC criticised the awarding of duty free supply and concessionaire contract to Phoenix violating the procedures of the Company. The transaction is being investigated by the law enforcement authorities.
SriLankan Airlines did not extend the contract with Phoenix upon expiry at the end of its five years term as the airline wanted to explore the best available options to improve the commercial returns to the Company through the on-board duty free sales programme. The decision of the Company was also consistent with the findings of the Report of the Board of Inquiry headed J.C Weliamuna, PC which were critical on the process of awarding the on-board duty free sales contract to Phoenix. The Airline decided to operate its own on board duty free programme as they did prior to 2012 as no duty free service provider submitted any bid for the tender carried out by the Airline to appoint a duty free services supplier.
The Plaintiff alleged that SriLankan had breached the agreement when it decided to operate its on board duty free programme. DFP had obtained ex parte enjoining orders from the Court compelling SriLankan Airlines to continue obtaining such services from Phoenix until disputes as to the rights are resolved through arbitration. SriLankan Airlines has denied that DFP has such rights.
One reason given by SriLankan Airlines is that it has an inherent right to do its duty-free operations after the contract ended.
The Court inter-alia held that on that basis, no injunction ought to be granted.
The Commercial High Court in its order, recognised that SriLankan Airlines doing its own duty-free operations is not a violation of any rights claimed by DFP.

Tribute to Dr. Saman Kelegama
On Friday, June 23, I received a phone alert that IPS Executive Director Dr. Saman Kelegama had passed away in Bangkok. I read and re-read the message and could not believe my eyes. In shock, I called both, Dr. Ravi Ratnayake and Chandanie Wijewardane to verify and both confirmed the news. It was only a month ago that I met Saman at the launch of Dr. Godfry Gunatilakes book at the BMICH. When I promised to visit him soon, I never dreamt in my wildest dreams that it would be my last encounter with him. The last living memory I will carry of Saman would be his relaxed and smiling face.
Dr. Saman Kelegama had an illustrious academic record; a first class Masters Degree from IIT Kanpur in Mathematics and Masters and PhD degrees from Oxford University. I met Saman through Ganeshan Vignaraja who also happened to be a student at Oxford at the time when both of them used to visit the Export Development Board in the late 80s to collect data for their thesis. The name Kelegama was not unknown to me since I am also from Kurunegala. Probably the second time I met him, Saman inquired my Kurunegala origins and from then onwards started a friendship which lasted till his demise. I was quite surprised by this young students quiet demeanor, humility and simplicity despite his impressive social status. He was much younger than I and he always treated me as an older sister from the day I met him. At the time, he was known as Dr. Jayantha Kelegamas, son but I knew that he never felt overshadowed by his fathers achievements.
Over the years, he made a name for himself as an internationally-renowned economist and eventually, Dr. Jayantha Kelegama would have been referred to as Samans father. Despite his long years in foreign climes, I was amazed at the unaffected mannerisms of this young and charming student and was proud of his achievements over the years.
Even before I joined the World Bank in 1989, I closely associated IPS which was located at the DFCC building since I knew Dr. Howard Nicholas, Dr. David Dunham and Purnima Rajapakse from my ISS days in The Hague. When Saman joined the IPS after obtaining his PhD, I met him once again and being small offices we used to be in and out of IPS and World Bank. From those days, Saman was the one we turned to for any studies or presentations relating to trade, industrialization, privatization and apparel sector exports.
At the time I recollect he was not much aligned with the Bretton Wood thinking. As Dr. Wijewardane has indicated in his article, Saman always was sincere in his expression of his academic views and would not worry about being politically correct. That was a trait he never gave up to his last day. He loved the country immensely and stayed through tough times even though he could have easily left for greener pastures.
He was born to a wealthy, Kandyan, aristocratic family, but was totally unaffected by his lineage and his academic excellence. He shunned popularity and kept a low profile compared to his contributions in the field of economics and always kept out of controversy to the extent possible. In the recent years, probably during the last decade, he was much more vocal in his views of the economy and the IPS State of the Economy was awaited with eagerness by the economists and policy makers alike.
Saman created space for many young economics undergraduates who could serve short stints at the IPS while studying abroad and also for graduates from Sri Lankan universities. He also created space for internationally-acclaimed Sri Lankan economists such as Prof. Premachandra Atukorale, Dr. Sisira Jayasooriya , Dr. Sarath Rajapathirana to name a few. He was also associated with the Gamini Corea Foundation. He had the good fortune of being groomed by his own father, Dr. Gamini Corea, Mr. Chandy Chamungam, Dr. Nimal Sanderatne and many more of such calibre which would have helped him to mature beyond his years. He was always disciplined, dignified and courteous and also treated the elders with due respect. Saman would be the dream son of any parent.
Despite IPS moving out of the DFCC premises, he never forgot to invite me to all the IPS events if they relate to trade, industrialization, privatization etc. I never missed an opportunity to attend the IPS events not only because of their intellectual content but also to meet eminent economists, policy makers, development specialists and academia. This was well-reflected at the large gathering at his funeral. All chose to come because of the admiration, respect and affection they had for Dr. Saman Kelegama. Everyone who heard of his demise had a tear in their eyes as its an irreparable loss to the nation. He had touched the hearts of all those who came into contact with him with his unique disposition.
Saman was large-hearted and would never refuse a last minute invitation to chair a session, be a guest speaker or be the chief guest at any event. In October 2016, we organized the launch of the Innovation report of the World Bank and the Minister Malik Samarawickrama was to be the chief guest. Around 7 p.m or so, I was informed that the minister had to attend another meeting with the President or the Prime Minister and that Dr. Kelegama had agreed to step in and I was asked to send the related documents to Saman at around 8 p.m. I am sure he would have had to at least glance through the documents to make the speech relevant to the topic the following day. We are guilty of stealing his spare time from him to save us from tricky situations like that.
Dr. Saman Kelegamas name is synonymous with IPS. From a small institution located on the second floor of DFCC Building, he moved it to St. Micheals Road and then to their own building at one of the most picturesque locations in Colombo which will remain a monument to Dr. Saman Kelegama. It will be hard to visit IPS in future without remembering Samans smiling face.
Its hard to record all his achievements in a short tribute and a lot has already been written on his professional achievements. He was on many private sector Boards, state agencies, banks, advisory committees, professional organisations and also on charitable organisations. He had so many academic publications to his name and contributed to the newspapers and academic journals. He paid the supreme price with his life for being magnanimous with his time to the rest of the world. Had he said no to the growing demands on his time and had he not been so passionate about his work, probably Saman would still be living among us.
I think Saman has been appropriately named. Like a jasmine flower with its haunting fragrance and simplicity, despite all the material and intellectual endowments, he remained remarkably humble. Saman has contributed very much more than his fair share to the country and the academic world and he will be remembered for his academic excellence, his forthrightness, simplicity and inborn charm for years to come and will be a role model for the future economists.
I wish to thank his mother, his wife Sirimavo, his son Chandana and daughter Jayathri for sharing Saman with us. Dear Saman, I wish you will never ever have an untimely death in this Sansara and may you attain Nibbana! We are sure to meet you again in our long journey of Sansara and till then, thank you and goodbye.

A tribute to late Dr Upali Mahanama my guru
Dr Upali Mahanama was a man of many parts, an internationally recognised marketing consultant, one of the best orators in Sri Lanka and above all a humble human being.
I first met him at Anglo Asians and he was the Managing Director marketing and I was a subordinate of his, he came from Lever Brothers where he was outstanding with his marketing strategies. He was head hunted by Anglo Asians to resurrect their flagging marketing division. He believed in team work and I found him easy to get on with, and he made some useful changes to that set up.
My next meeting with him was after a long time at Weli Park, Nawala, where I met him and he invited me to his home. At the time, I was about to embark on my third cricket book The Saga of The Maroons and I desperately needed his guidance. He was a hard task master, but the tips and advice he gave me was invaluable in spite of his busy schedule. He was a Marketing Consultant to many prestigious companies in Asia then.
I used to meet him at 11am sharp at his residence in Nugegoda, and I suppose that was his auspicious time and he used to give me about 40 precious minutes of his invaluable time. He did not interfere with my flow of writing but gave me good advice on editing, the contents, and how to approach people for interviews and conduct them; his knowledge of writing was out of this world. He never hesitated to call a spade a spade. He was a simple down to earth, gentleman who was always at ease, either in his sarong and banian at home or in his three-piece suit delivering lectures to prestigious audiences right around the globe. He was raconteur par excellence, who could hold and audience spell bound for hours on end.
I owe a great debt to him for resurrecting my career as a writer. After writing for a couple of newspapers and, getting nowhere, he recommended me to the present sports editor of this newspaper who graciously gave me the opportunity to write my own weekly column called Reminiscing with Tilak. Without this introduction by Doc (I always refer to Dr Mahanama as Doc), I would have still been an also ran.
Doc my guru guided me all the way to the launch of my book as follows, booking the hall, list of invitees, designing the invitation cards, etc, etc.
The last time I saw him was during the New Years Day. On that day he looked hale and hearty, and encouraged me to keep going and wished me luck. From then on, I did not want to trouble him much. His family and Roshan Mahanama in particular did their best till the very end but nobody could stop him from going to heaven.

Trolls from the Woodwork..!
Robert Clements
The trolls of today are like worms from the woodwork! They roam the face of websites, whatsapp groups and have a huge online presence!
In the good ole days, when one read or heard fairytales on ones mothers lap, the troll was a dwarf in Scandinavian folklore who dwelt in the hills, small, tiny fellows, who were afraid of the outside world, hid themselves from the public eye, but were mean, nasty and vicious, in the way they carried out little cowardly attacks on people at large, not directly, but behind their backs.
Todays trolls, arent any different.
They are like worms in the woodwork, who come out at night and scratch, irritate, and cause small annoyances. They are basically cowards, who have the same agenda of terrorists; hit and run. I know a fellow, who loves to attack the views of others in his group. I had known him before the advent of the internet, when his trolling traits had no exposure; he was a shy, insecure fellow, who loved dressing the macho, but it ended there.He did not have the confidence to be that macho. He would wear the skimpiest shorts to an official event just to be noticed.
This bizarre dressing, revealed a little fellow who wanted to show he was a big man. Later when he started trolling, I realized it was an inborn trait; hiding behind the anonymity and security of online activity, knowing, he could not be physically harmed, he went about his trolling activities, which I must say would have been interesting for any psychologist to observe. He portrayed himself a giant, walking the face of the earth, flexing muscles and pretending to have biceps and six pack chests, with his four letterwords, and mockery.
They are like shadow giants, holding a focus light to their dwarf figures, so the screen will show them off as monsters.
Their fighting is similar to a terrorist: As much as the terrorist targets women and children, trolls, target innocents, and others who have just come online to make a statement or share their views.
This troll, I know off, lets call him Pankaj, sits in his group and tries to show everyone what a woman killer he is, sends sexual pictures to everyone, pretending he is bedding all of them, even as one knows he is actually gay.
Such are the trolls of today.
How do you deal with trolls
The best and most effective way is to Ignore them, though same troll always has little baby trolls, who encourage him be sending smileys or little thumbs up signs whenever he says something. Though ignoring is difficult, it still works. Its like the victor of a marathon who when asked, what his biggest obstacle was, replied, Pebbles and dirt in my shoes!
Thats all they are, these trolls; worms from the woodwork,or just dirt in your shoe..!

Trump travel ban comes into effect

People from six mainly Muslim countries and all refugees now face tougher US entry due to President Donald Trump's controversial travel ban.
It means people without close family or business relationships in the US could be denied visas and barred entry.
Grandparents, aunts, uncles, nephews and nieces are not considered to be "bona fide" relations.
The rules apply to people in Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, as well as all refugees.
Moments before the ban began at 20:00 Washington time (00:00 GMT), it emerged that the state of Hawaii had asked a federal judge for clarification.
It has in the past accused the US government of violating the Supreme Court's instructions by improperly excluding people.
Earlier this week, the Supreme Court partially upheld the ban, lifting injunctions that had halted one of Trumps key policies.
The court ruled that people seeking visas to travel to the US from the six restricted countries, and all refugees, would have to prove a "bona fide relationship" to someone in the country.
The Supreme Court is expected to make a final decision on the ban in October.
Who can come in
According to the new rules, for the next 90 days those from the six countries without a close relationship will not be able to enter the US.
IN- a parent, spouse, fianc, child, son- or daughter-in-law, or sibling, including step- or half-siblings.
OUT- grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, in-laws, extended family and grandchildren.
Also exempt from the new rules are those with business or educational ties to the US.
However, the guidelines specifically state that the relationship must be formal, documented and not formed for the purpose of evading the order.
Those who already hold valid visas are not affected. Dual nationals who travel on their passport from the unaffected country will also be allowed entry.
The court also approved a 120-day ban on refugees entering the US, allowing the government to bar entry to refugee claimants who cannot prove the same ties to an American individual or entity.
After the Supreme Court ruling:
Attorney General Jeff Sessions said "the threat to our national security is real and becoming increasingly dangerous". He said the ruling was "an important step towards restoring the separation of powers between the branches of the federal government"
Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants' Rights Project, said that "in practical terms most of the people who stood to be affected by the ban will still be allowed to come in"
David Miliband, president of theInternational Rescue Committee (IRC),said "the court's decision threatens damage to vulnerable people waiting to come to the US: people with urgent medical conditions blocked, innocent people left adrift, all of whom have been extensively vetted"
How did we get here
The US President insisted his ban was necessary for national security and pointed to terrorist attacks in Paris, London, Brussels and Berlin as evidence.
However, critics called the policy un-American and Islamophobic, and that this ban would not have stopped atrocities in the US perpetrated by American-born attackers.
The original ban, released on 27 January, provoked mass protests at American airports.
It included Iraq among nations whose travellers would be barred from the US, and imposed a full ban on refugees from Syria.
The president issued a revised version with a narrower scope on 6 March to overcome some of the legal problems.
The policy was left in limbo after it was struck down by federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland.

Venus Williams at fault in fatal car crash in Florida - Police

US tennis star Venus Williams has been involved in a car crash that led to the death of a 78-year-old man.
A spokesman for Palm Beach Gardens Police in Florida confirmed to the BBC they were investigating a fatal crash involving the Grand Slam champion.
A man was taken to hospital after the accident on 9 June and died two weeks later from his injuries, he said.
Police believe she was at fault but her lawyer says it was an accident. She has not been cited or charged.
The man who died, Jerome Barson, was travelling with his wife who was driving their vehicle through an intersection when the collision happened.
Williams' car suddenly darted into their path and was unable to clear the junction in time due to traffic jams, according to witness statements in a police report obtained by US media.
Barson was also taken to hospital but survived.
"[ Williams] is at fault for violating the right of way of [the other driver]," the report said, adding that there were no other factors like drugs, alcohol or mobile phone distractions.
The 37-year-old, seven-time Grand Slam champion reportedly told police she did not see the couple's car and she was driving slowly.
Williams' lawyer Malcolm Cunningham told CNN in a statement: "Williams entered the intersection on a green light. The police report estimates that Williams was travelling at 5mph when Barson crashed into her.
"Authorities did not issue Williams with any citations or traffic violations. This is an unfortunate accident and Venus expresses her deepest condolences to the family who lost a loved one."
Next week, Williams is due to play her 20th Wimbledon tournament in London, where she is seeded 10th.
Williams and her sister Serena have dominated the women's game for two decades.

Volvo starts sourcing industrial engines  from India
Swedish automaker Volvo Group has started sourcing engines for industrial applications from its equal joint venture with Eicher Motors, VE Commercial Vehicles, and may shift sourcing of engines for non-automotive products to India in the long run.
India is already the exclusive manufacturing hub for the 5-8 litre, medium-duty Euro VI engines for automotive applications for Volvo's home base in Europe. Two people aware of the companys plans said Volvo Group plans to make India the main base for manufacturing engines for industrial applications.
An emailed query to the company seeking comments on the proposed plans remained unanswered as of press time Tuesday. Vinod Aggarwal, managing director at VE Commercial Vehicles, confirmed the company has started supplying medium duty enginees for industrial applications from its facility in Pithampur, Madhya Pradesh.
Gradually, we will cater to more applications for non-automotive, he told ET. We will get into gen-sets. There are also some other non-automotive departments like construction equipment, he said.
VE Powertrain, one of the five business verticals of VE Commercial Vehicles, already exports 2,000 engines for automotive applications every month to Volvo AB.
A separate production line has been set up in Pithampur for the manufacture of Volvo Penta engines.
The 5- and 8-liter engine Besides engines, Volvo AB is also likely to begin overseas sales of light duty UD Trucks later this year, said the sources cited earlier.
The trucks, to be built in Pithampur and meant for the Indonesian market, are now under trial and shipments will begin in the second half of 2017, they said.
Volvo Buses also intends to use the base in Bengaluru to export vehicles to western Europe in future, they said.
VE Powertrain currently has capacity to roll out 50,000 engines every year.

## Title: Water, water everywhere 
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

Water, water everywhere 
Water comprises 71 percent of the Earths surface. Yet only three percent of it is freshwater. Out of this three percent, much is in a frozen state. Actually, only 0.5 percent of the above three percent is available for the sustenance of life of humans, animals and plants.
These figures, however, do not show the magnitude of the true scarcity of water in the world. By 2025, half the population of the world would be subjected to water -based vulnerability. By 2030, demand for water would increase supply by almost 50 percent in some developing countries. So in the foreseeable future water will become a scarce resource akin to gold. That is why some predict even water wars ahead.
Sri Lanka, however, is fortunate that it is blessed with abundant rainfall. It has 103 river basins which together with lagoons and other water-filled areas in the Jaffa peninsula and the coastal zones contain a drainage area of 65,531 sq km. Sri Lankas problems arise not from the shortage of water but from our inability to manage the water we have. Water conservation and flood control are the issues to be tackled. Though politicians and others boast about our ancient hydraulic civilisation in which maximum use of rainwater was the norm today the policy implemented is in contrast to the policy enunciated by King Parakramabahu that not a drop of water should flow into the sea without being utilised.
Disaster Management Centre
The extent of the damage caused by floods is best illustrated by the devastation and loss of human life in the recent floods. According to the Disaster Management Centre 415,441 persons of 109, 041 families were displaced due to floods. The number of deaths and those missing was 213 and 76 respectfully. Houses destroyed included 21,573 partially destroyed and 3, 126 fully destroyed.
Sri Lanka has experienced not only recurrent major floods but also recurrent droughts. The changes in the ecological balance due to deforestation and development activities could be cited as a factor causing this phenomenon. For example, Sri Lankas forest cover decreased from 84 percent in 1881 to 20 percent in 2005. Between 1990 and 2010, it lost 20.9 percent of its forest cover. Today the forest cover approximates 18 percent and it is decreasing at a rate of nearly 1.5 percent per year. In addition, the effects of the El Nio and El Nia phenomena, caused by global warming were also contributory factors to the present disastrous weather pattern.
Though floods have occurred according to a regular pattern and the necessity of flood control was acknowledged by governments for over five decades nothing adequate or substantial was done to eliminate or at least minimise the damage. There was no dearth of expert opinion or feasibility studies and project proposals, often multi-purpose ones. They were either ignored, cast aside or not pursued in earnest. At best partial projects were implemented with short-term interests, often with a view of seeking electoral advantages. Best examples are the Gin Ganga and Nilwala projects.
One big drawback has been the power ignorant (subject-wise) politicians have in the decision-making process over technical experts in the relevant field. For example, a US-based firm had conducted feasibility studies and reported to the government on a comprehensive development of the Nilwala basin which included a series of tanks upstream to regulate the rapid flow of the Nilwala waters which descend from a height of 1050 meters in Deniyaya to a mere 12 meters in Bopagoda, Akuressa. Even the rushed Chinese project was implemented later only partially.
The defects in it were partly responsible for the vast devastation in the Nilwala basin during the recent floods. The failure to construct a bypass canal to divert part of the river waters to the sea at Browns Hill was a major reason for the inundation of the Matara city.
Short-term remedies
It is clear that what is lacking is the political will and commitment to the public good among ruling politicians, whatever their colour may be. The latter often turn a deaf ear to public complaints and ignore or abandon necessary environmental feasibility studies and regulations. The results of such actions are visible in the drying of the water resources in the Uma Oya project area and the destruction of houses and property of the villagers.
Even when disaster has struck the authorities do not go beyond short-term remedies including urgent rehabilitation.
The latter is also trammeled by bureaucratic red tape and political partisanship. For example, lack of foresight and proper estimation has caused a flood of donations comprising dry and cooked food items and water bottles but damage assessment is moving slowly due to the lethargy of officials that even money made available by the Government cannot be disbursed in time at ground level to the needy.
This shows the defects in disaster preparedness and the set-backs or absence of public awareness of impending disasters. It is necessary to have pre-planned spots to house the population that would have to be evacuated. Also, sufficient stocks of food and other necessities should be stocked early to be used in a contingency.
Above all, there should be long-term solutions that would eliminate or minimise floods and other calamities. Naturally, this involves a huge outlay of capital. However, they should get priority over other projects, especially those that have only a cosmetic value or that are implemented despite their low-priority status to improve electoral chances of ruling party politicians.
Further wasteful expenditure including those for the maintenance of a jumbo Cabinet of Ministers and foreign trips of politicians and officials as well as the privilege offered by the President to some of his faithful companions to join his entourage on foreign trips despite their inability to contribute in any meaningful way to official activities abroad.
We are living through an extraordinary situation in which natural and man-made disasters have struck us. In addition, the country is strangled in a death trap from which it is very difficult to get extricated. The state of the economy is precarious. State machinery is clogged with lethargy and inefficiency not to mention the possible presence of political sabotage.
It is time to stop internal feuds, delivering sermons, playing hosannas and get down to work in earnest in the true spirit of patriotism and not in its fraudulent rhetorical form. What matters is not which leader or political party would benefit but how the people would benefit and how they would benefit.

Zimbabwe looking to do damage with spin
GALLE: Zimbabwe will be looking to do some damage to Sri Lankas batting through their spinners during the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka starting at Galle today.
We rely heavily on our spin department which we hope if there is a bit of spin in Sri Lanka we can exploit that. With our spin dominant team we can do some damage tomorrow, said Zimbabwe skipper Graeme Cremer at the pre-match press conference.
Leg-break and googly bowler Cremer leads the group of spinners that also includes off-spinner Sikander Raza and slow left-arm orthodox bowlers Wellington Masakadza and Sean Williams.
Masakadza is doubtful after getting injured during practice on Wednesday.
Wellington has to go to Colombo for a scan but its not looking great at this stage. By the end of today or tomorrow morning we will know his exact situation once he has the scan, said Cremer.
Zimbabwe is also confident with their batting which runs deep.
After the last Scotland and Holland tours we found that we have a lot of batting depth. Its just worked up with the combinations we are trying to play. We bat all the way upto no. 10 hopefully we can use that, said Cremer who is recovering from a bout of flu which he picked up on his arrival in Sri Lanka.
It was a long trip and I had a bit of flu thats kicked in the last few days. Feeling a bit better today hopefully by tomorrow will be 100 percent, said Cremer.
Apart from the captain three other team members was also hit by the bug. We got medication yesterday think everyone will be alright by tomorrow.
Cremer expects his team to struggle against the hot conditions they will experience in Sri Lanka.
"Obviously its a bit hot and especially after our last two tours to Scotland and Holland which was very different from here. Two days to get used to this condition is quite tough and we will find it tough tomorrow, said Cremer. A few of our guys have toured here before so we know how to handle it. I think we will be okay.
Its always tough touring Sri Lanka because of the conditions here and the wickets arent what we are used to but yesterday and today luckily we got wickets out in the centre which we think is similar to the actual match pitch. Its been good preparation. I think we will be able to adjust, Cremer said.
Cremer is confident his boys will be able to counter the threat posed by fast bowler Lasith Malinga.
He is a world class bowler but luckily a lot of us have played him before. We know he is an asset to Sri Lankan cricket we just need to deal with him as best as we can, said Cremer. Hes got a lot of variations and he is a lot different to other bowlers but we are lucky that we have played him before so it will be a lot easier facing him.
Cremer said that it was disappointing to see his team not be in the top eight of the ODI rankings. West Indies is also in the same boat its just one of those things. We cant delve too much on that but we need to put in some good performances over the next couple of months and try and qualify for the World Cup. Thats a stepping stone and thats where we want to be. We know we just need to win games to get into that top eight, said Cremer.

One of the prime objectives of the Government is to provide a luxurious life for plantation sector employees, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President was addressing a gathering at Highlands College, Hatton yesterday. The event was organised to mark the 125 anniversary of the college.
A 10 acre land was offered to the school following the settlement of a dispute over the ownership.
President Sirisena said the Government has taken measures to provide a luxurious life for plantation sector employees, including making more room for them to access to education while increasing health facilities.
He said millions of Rupees is invested annually to develop health and education facilities.
About 750 Tamil medium teachers will be recruited to end the teacher scarcity in the Central Province, he said.
The President said allocation on education and health can be considered as an investment. He said education is not merely gaining qualifications but to make citizens with human values for the country. Anyone can pass examinations by working hard, more qualities are needed to pass the life, he said.
The President urged students to refrain from using drugs, including cigarettes, ganga and other narcotics. He said the Nuwara Eliya district records the highest usage of alcohol. President Sirisena said students have to work in an advanced world. He asked the students to get only the useful part of the high-tech gadgets. Facebook has become a hindrance to the ethnic harmony.

Govt committed to add more solar,  wind energy to national grid
The government is committed towards adding more solar and wind energy to the national grid, and has promised to make the national grid a smart grid in another five years time, said Ajith C Perera Deputy Minister of Power and Renewable Energy.
According to Minister, Sri Lanka is to call tenders to purchase 875 megawatts of power shortly.
He made these commitments speaking at the launch of the Green Energy 2017 Champion Campaign , organized by the German Federal Foreign Office together with the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy of Sri Lanka, and the project implementing partner Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH and Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority .
In order to add more solar and wind energy to national grid, it is necessary to have more storing capacity and safeguard smart systems in place.
Storage of energy is still high in another parts of the world as well, the minister said adding that as per the opinions of the specialists in Sri Lanka, the country can add more than 500 megawatts from solar energy without having the storage capacities.
During the next one and a half years, it is planned to add that capacity to the national grid. As per the policy, in power generation, the government will invest in infrastructure, development of the systems, but the government will not invest in power generation.
As we have introduced fair tendering process, there has been a good response in the private sector both locally and globally to invest in this sector.
With regard to solar power, Sri Lanka opened a competitive tender in this regard as result, the country managed to reduce tariff from Rs 22.10 per unit to Rs 17.01 per unit.In 2016, May the government opened the same tender with regard to the wind energy, through that tariffs were reduced from Rs 19 per unit to Rs 12.29 per unit, registering more than 40% reduction.
Speaking at the event, Jorn Rohde, German Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives, stressed that political consensus is crucial for implementing and persisting renewal energy initiatives to meet set targets in the energy sector of Sri Lanka.
The ambassador also stressed the need to initiate climate mitigation efforts by both individual and state level to avert foreseeable environmental perils.

Living with MS- addressing the issues of Multiple Sclerosis
World MS Day:
In a bid to raise awareness about Multiple Sclerosis (MS) amongst the general public Multiple Sclerosis Association of Lanka (MSAL) organized a walk themed Living with MS on World MS Day with the participation of MS patients and care givers recently.
The participants commenced the walk from the Cinnamon Gardens Baptists Church premises and continued towards the Viharamahadevi Park and back for a commemorative lunch served at the church. On a courteous gesture the MSAL went on a step further to reimburse a portion of travel costs that MS patients had to bear. Multiple Sclerosis is a disorder of the brain and the spinal cord (the central nervous system) which causes communication problems between the brain and the rest of the body due to the immune system attacking the protective sheath that covers nerve fibers. A significant segment of the general public is not aware of this condition which severely impacts the lives of both the patients and their families and requires the interest and support of the larger community.
Calling for heightened public awareness of the condition, the MSAL, President Dr. Enoka Corea stated at the event that one of their key areas of concerns for MS patients are the lack of accessibility for them to public-spaces  be it a place of entertainment, place-of-worship and more importantly the lack of employment opportunities for them.
This is a serious issue which causes patients to feel useless and unproductive which in turn tends to affect their mental health and well-being. The stigma of disability and unwarranted pity can alienate them from day-today-activities and the society in general. It is important to remind ourselves that all of us will have some sort of a disability with ageing and that all of us benefit if we address these issues, she added.
In Sri Lanka, MSAL has held commemorations of this day ever since the first World MS day in 2009.

Uma Oya Project launched in unsuitable conditions by MR government
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksas government implemented the Uma Oya Project with the expertise of Iran even though their machines were not suitable to be used in a wet zone in which Uma Oya Project was to be implemented, United National Party (UNP) Galle District MP Wijepala Hettiarachchi said.
Speaking at a media briefing at Sirikotha, UNP Headquarters yesterday, he said no proper feasibility study was carried out prior to the implementation of the project.
Hettiarachchi said, Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa puts the blame on the present government for the irregularities and negative effects of the project although the project was implemented by the former President in 2011 by obtaining a loan of Rs. 500 million. The UNP implemented the Mahaweli Project and it is successful even after it was implemented 30 years ago.
The MP said the consensus government regained the GSP Plus tax concession leading to a rise in the apparel industry. Also, lifting the ban on Sri Lankas fisheries exports to the European market had opened up many opportunities for the country.
He said the present government had to face over eight hazards consecutively but the government managed to execute its responsibilities efficiently to provide relief for the victims.
Hettiarachchi said the government had spent over Rs. 62 million to construct buildings including cafeterias and aesthetic centres to all national schools and Rs. 200 million was allocated to build an allied health faculty.
Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera also participated.

Asian Business Angel Forum to give  SLs startup eco-system new boost
Colombo is gearing up to host some of Asias most prominent angel investors and venture capitalists with the Asian Business Angel Forum (ABAF) 2017 being held in conjunction with Venture Engine, Sri Lankas most successful platform for accelerating and expanding the countrys most promising entrepreneurial concepts.
ABAF is Asia's only investor conference that brings together angel investors, HNIs, venture capitalists and other key stakeholders to one platform that focuses on global startup trends and best practices amongst a host of topics, attracting over 250 leading investors from across the Asian, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Australasian regions.
The result of a bold partnership between founders BOV Capital, the Indian angel network and the Lankan angel network, Venture Engine has led the way in developing the startup eco-system in the country.
From the outset, our vision for Venture Engine was to serve not only as a place to bring together Sri Lankas most ambitious and talented entrepreneurs, but also as an incubator capable of nurturing skills and honing business models to the level that these businesses can then work to aggressively compete on the global stage, said Prajeeth Balasubramaiam of BOV Capital. "Selection as the host country for the Asian Business Angel Forum 2017 is a testament of how far the start-up ecosystem in the country has progressed over the last few years. This is a truly unprecedented opportunity for our local entrepreneurs to go beyond their familiar boundaries and take their business to the next level. I strongly urge anyone who feels that they have a strong business plan along with a novel business model to step forward and take up the challenge, Lankan Angel Network Chairman, Dumith Fernando said.
Submissions for Venture Engine 2017 will be open up to August 9, following which the best business ideas will be selected for a programme of rapid improvement over the course of five workshops with filtering and mentoring between sessions. The ABAF programme will commence on October 12 at Cinnamon Lakeside which will include an opportunity for the Venture Engine finalists to present their ideas to ABAF participants.
The opening of the conference will be followed by an exhibition held in parallel featuring ten stalls, including five stalls reserved for Sri Lankan startups with the balance featuring exciting new startups from across the Asian region. The exhibition will be open to all visitors, and will provide a platform for startups looking to scale upwards in the region to raise their next round of funding.

From baby steps to giant strides
[Achievements]
Shakespeare drama comp (YMCA)  Winner 1997
Runners up 1999
Inter house drama comp
 2005, 2008, 2011
Holy Family Convent has the brains when it comes to drama. The girls are in the process of reviving drama at the Inter-House and Inter-school level. The outfit holds great promise as a team in transition. Dramatic Moves features the girls of HFC who certainly have what it takes to win the hearts and minds of Sri Lanka.
Enhancing many aspects
English drama has to a great extent always functioned under the English Literary Union of the school. However theatre productions have been produced by one of the main language unions of the school. In 2014 there was a big production by the English Union Youve got it pussy cat. Before this there have been large scale productions by Holy Family Convent.
We havent taken part in inter-school competitions for some time and we have revived the inter-house drama competition this year after a lull of six years. However drama has not been completely out of the school system as each year the language unions have been putting on a big show.
I am a firm believer that kids need to be exposed to drama and theatre. Kids need an avenue for creative expression and this is possible through drama and theatre. Theatre and drama is an essential component in a school as it enhances many aspects of a student and at HFC we are very focused on sending out girls with well-rounded personalities who are able to make a mark in society.
Many of the times HFC did take part in Interschool competitions in the past years, we have got into the finals and ended up winning or achieving runners up position. Especially in the year 2011 our cast and crew won many awards including the champion trophy at the State Shakespeare Competition.
Through the inter house drama competition this year, which is scheduled for September this year, we are hoping to bring out not only the acting abilities of our girls but we are also focused on bringing out the hidden talents of our students in the areas of directing, costume designing, make up, music and lighting. All aspects of the house dramas will be done by the girls themselves with very little intervention by adults.
Adults merely supervise and provide guidance only when necessary. We have been preparing for this competition since April with workshops headed by well- known theatre people in the Sri Lankan English drama scene. Jerome De Silva was the first, followed by Feroze Kamardeen, Rapti Fernando, Jeremiah James and the directors were given a workshop on aspects of directing by Tracy Holsinger. We of course cannot forget our very own Samantha de S Wijeratne, who has been our strength in all factors of drama in school. The initiation of the Performing Arts Club at school was under her guidance as well as another past pupil Minelle Ferdinandis. We cannot forget the administration headed by our very own principal Rev. Sr Deepa Fernando who is a constant source of inspiration to us. It is with her fullest support and cooperation that we are able to take drama forward in the school.
We are taking baby steps but I am certain that in a couple of years HFC will once again be in the forefront of inter school drama. That is my wish and dream for my alma mater, said Co -Teacher in Charge Sherika Fernando.
Fascinating
Director of Ambrose Roshella Samarasinghe admits that drama is a unique love of hers.
For the past few years in drama, HFC has not been in competitions, though we've had the public production  youve got it pussy cat. And regarding an interschool drama competitions, we have been unable to participate. So far in my eyes our most outstanding performance has been the "You've got it, pussy cat" musical. Reviving drama at HFC is one thing I will see done before I leave school as it is something I have been passionate from the moment I've entered these gates, said Samarasinghe.
Samarasinghe loves drama because of the sense of freedom she receives expressing herself.
It is a unique love of mine. It's a way of expressing yourself through the expressions of another, a way of bringing to life what was written down on paper and a way of combining the different talents in people to create a masterpiece, explains Samarasinghe.
Each dramatist is unique and they each hold a unique talent.
It's this rainbow of individuality that takes a good production and makes it a super production. It's not a matter of combination or even compensation, but rather a matter of portraying each dramatist's power like a colorful tile in a mosaic that creates a masterpiece, elucidated Samarasinghe.
Samarasinghe is a strong believer that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
The little challenges I have faced throughout my years in this school, even though they seemed invincible at first, now look trivial now that I've overcome them. All it takes is believing in yourself and an allergy to the idea of quitting, added Samarasinghe.
Samarasinghe concedes that drama is something which is a big part in the school life of any Familian.
It is an activity that welcomes everyone from all backgrounds. Also I would really love to see HFC take home the inter school drama competition trophies like we used to, said Samarasinghe.
As mentioned before the brains are there at HFC.
Training our girls will not be an arduous task since they're so talented. Half of my job as director is complete.
When playing a character of depth, all I can say is research. One playing such a character must be able to step into their shoes completely and assess situations from their point of view even to the extent of living life like them while on stage. Unlike impersonation and imitation, what sets acting apart from other skills is how you as person, if you were born into that character's particular time period or place, and if you experienced the things the character has experienced, would react. It's the combination of the personalities of the character and the performer that gives rise to an amazing actor, explained Samarasinghe.
Samarasinghe is fascinated by drama.
Drama is something very close to my heart. My favourite part about it, is the fact that you can live many lives in one. What's beautiful about it is, how you can radiate your emotions through the words of another, I find it absolutely incredible, shared Samarasinghe.
Nothing is perfect and even a production consisting of an impeccable cast and crew will lack some aspect of producing what the playwright had in mind. Nevertheless we hope to make Oscar Wilde proud. We as a school are really excited in making this a reality, we as a house are extremely enthusiastic and looking forward to creating a brilliant play, and I, as a director, am honored in being a part of it all, said Samarasinghe.
A great joy
Director of Carmel House, Malithi Kulathunga said,During the years HFC has done dramas in all three languages - Sinhala, English and Tamil. The last time we took part in an inter-house was in 2011, and ever since then we have given more attention to school productions. In my opinion the school production that was done in 2014 "You got it Pussy Cat"was the best so far. Drama is not all about showing your talent but its about teamwork, bonds between cast and crew and also about commitment. As a young girl it's extremely important to have these values.
When talking about the unique strengths of our dramatists I feel that it is a combination of unique personalities makes it more interesting to work with them. The differences among all of us is what binds all of us together as a family, as Familians, explained Kulathunga.
Kulathunga firmly believes that drama in HFC will be better than ever with all the guidance they receive from everyone.
Drama means being part of a world that people think that they can't become a part of. I find it adventurous and I also take great joy in being a part of it. The girls are united which is an advantage, but they speak for themselves when they show their dedication, said Kulathunga.

Establishing a name
Director of Sebastian House Sheneli Jayasundara said that the eagerness to win is certainly there. Our drama club functions under the English Union. Our girls are very enthusiastic, excited and talented when it comes to drama. In the past where I can remember dating back to 2010 /2011 HFC had a theatre circle which was functioning really well.
In the theatre circle our girls organized and took part in inter house drama competitions which were totally handled by our girls from script writing, to lights and sounds, to props and costume designing.
Back then we took part in Inter-house Shakespeare competitions as well. But after that for quite a few years, the theatre circle died down and our girls didn't have a platform to showcase their skills. Then in 2014 the excitement was restored with the production of the musical Youve got it Pussy cat directed by Jith Peiris. The following years we had productions in both Sinhalese and Tamil. And this year we're back with an inter house drama competition, said Jayasundara.
Jayasundara also commented that it would be their greatest pleasure to see the girls establish a name in the field of performing arts and drama.
Drama is important in the life of a student because it will not only help us upgrade our talents but it will also teach us to work together, to compromise, to commit ourselves to whatever we do, to work on time and many more. These are things that we would never learn sitting in a class room. Drama will teach us values that would last a lifetime. Combining all their strengths will help cover up the weaknesses and understanding their capabilities and helping them to be themselves on stage and seeing the stage and the play through their eyes and sense will lead us to a successful production, pointed out Jayasundara.
All actresses are different in their skills and physical abilities.
I believe that it wouldn't be that hard to groom and train our girls since I know for a fact that they will assist me and give their fullest cooperation. There will be teachers in charge and a guide so it won't be that difficult to handle the cast. I'd love to see our girls doing massive productions or perhaps get back to the stage of Shakespeare competitions, added Jayasundara.
An added advantage
Director of Suzanne House Shania Perera is confident that HFC will come back bigger and stronger.
During the past few years HFC has embraced drama in Sinhalese, Tamil and English languages. Diversity in HFC plays a big part and we love that aspect embedded in our school. The last time we took part in inter school drama was in 2011 and since then we've paid more attention to school based productions. We are confident that we will be ready to get back out there very soon.
In my opinion the inter house drama competition held not very long ago was very successful, and it definitely is a pity that the public did not get to witness that, but the productions after that made up for it, said Perera.
Drama isn't just showcasing your talents, it's about teamwork, coordination, bonds between the cast and crew, hard work and commitment combined.
As a student it is extremely important to have these aspects and it's not only as a student but also as a young woman.
Our girls are dedicated, strong, funny, with serious personalities and a drive to strive for the best. The variety of personalities make it interesting to work with. Each and every one of them have unique characters with all these differences is more than enough to achieve a super production, explained Perera. As house directors, Perera and her fellow directors are still underway in the training department and they are excited and nervous at the same time.
Drama in HFC will be bigger and better than ever. With the current guidance and knowledge we receive from all sources, it will improve with time.
When stepping into the skin of complicated characters, I think the best way to do so, is advice the girls to think the way people from the early centuries did. There are differences in eras and every aspect is important. They need to observe and research on everything that links to the character they portray, advised Perera.
Perera feels that drama means a lot to her.
I would love to make a career out of it. And I just find great joy in acting and being a part of this. The girls speak for themselves when they show their level of commitment and dedication. The girls bond together very well which is an added advantage.
The previous productions gave us a pretty good view on how we should handle the cast and crew. Also with the advice we received from the teachers and external parties have been very helpful. Teamwork means a great deal when it comes to production. So we'll have to wait and see how everything turns out, clarified Perera.

CCC continuously engaged with Govt policymakers - Ranatunga
Using the Chamber principles as a basis of engagement, the Chamber through its secretariat, the trade associations as well as the business councils, have continuously engaged with the Government policymakers and the multilateral agencies, to influence and fashion out positions which could be beneficial to its membership, said Samantha Ranatunga, Outgoing Chairman, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce addressing the 178th AGM yesterday.
We had many engagements with the policymakers during the last 2 years where we articulated the Chamber position. We won some but we lost more. However, in true Chamber spirit, we always put the Country first more than narrow industry specific initiatives. This is clear from the positions we have taken on taxation and trade agreements. We have taken on true Country priorities and tried to bring them to the National or International platform. Two of our ground breaking activities were the Investor Forum as well as the Innovation Strategy event which was held during March 2017. These were in addition to the other main prestigious events, the Economic Summit and the Best Corporate Citizen Awards, he said. To promote investments, the 2 investor forums showcased the potential of Sri Lanka, where both events attracted nearly 150 participants from over 40 countries. At these events, CCC about the practical issues faced by investors in Sri Lanka and how to find solutions for it. The Innovation Summit was for future entrepreneurs of this country, where some of the best innovators in the world and in Sri Lanka spoke about the technological opportunities which exists and how the country could benefit. This was a launching pad for the knowledge economy a key competitive area of opportunity for Sri Lanka. The Chamber has always actively promoted what it felt right for Sri Lanka and best for its success, he said.
What we seek from the Government is a true partnership. The private sector always strives to build a bridge of trust with the Government leaving room for dialog and healthy debate. Let us use this as a connection for a brighter future, where we continue to build mutual confidence. Our Chief Guest Dr. Binod Chaudhry has the business confidence as he has been investing in Sri Lanka from the 2,000, even while the war was at its peak, he added. See also page iii

CEB asked to submit 12 expansion plans
Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the electricity sector regulator, asked the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to develop12 new scenarios which will provide different power plant combinations to generate electricity for next 20 years and submit the plans on or before July 7.
PUCSL said these scenarios should be developed with updated prices for coal, natural gas and oil and with the cost of externalities (social and environmental costs) and should be submitted together with input data.
We carried out an in-depth study on the proposed Least Cost Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan 2018-2037 prepared by CEB and analysed the comments and proposals that key stakeholders made during our public consultation process, Damitha Kumarasinghe, Director General of PUCL said.
Taking all that into the accounts, PUCSL requested 12 new scenarios to be submitted apart from the plant combination recommended in the plan, so that the nation can be ensured that every option is studied and best 20-year power plant plan is given approval.
PUCSL instructed CEB to use the electricity demand forecast on the recommended power plant combination (Base case) in the proposed Least Cost Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP) 2018-2037 to develop these new scenarios and to do away with the assumption that pump storage plants are mandatory.
The LCLTGEP has been compiled based on the results of the latest electricity expansion planning studies conducted by the CEB for the planning period of 2018-2037.

Challenging portrayals
Hima Tharaka (Snowy Stars), the latest film directed by well-known journalist, lyricist, film and teledrama director Rodney Widanapathirana has begun screening in film halls islanbdwide. This movie comes after his film Ira Sevaya.
The cast of Hima Tharaka includes the award winning artistes Jagath Chamila, Nadee Chandrasekara, Amarasiri Kalansuriya, Wimal Alahakoon, Maureen Charuni, Wasanthi Gunarathna, Miyuri Samarasinghe and Manel Wanaguru.
Q: Is Hima Tharaka being screened as a gap film
Yes, we know that a gap film is screened in the time period left between two films.
Q: Recently many such films were screened. Ira Sewaya was also screened as a gap film. What is the reason for that
It is because of the current situation in the film industry. There is a significant delay in screening films which is a huge disadvantage for the producer. They have to wait for a long time having invested money on the project until the screening. If the film becomes less popular the producer has to bear additional financial losses too.
Q: One of the major problems in the industry is the inability to bring people to film halls. People are not coming to film halls much.
The situation has become serious compared to the past. In the past a film producer was able to at least find the invested money even if the film becomes a slight success.
Thats why Hima Tharaka was screened as a gap film. Our need to do something for the industry as artistes has been restricted due to such challenges we have to face. The high production cost is the main issue. Films which are produced investing a lot of money might bring alot of revenue however, the profit is not enough compared to the expenses.
Q: Even popular film producers are now thinking twice before producing a film.
How was the film Hima Tharaka produced
Hima Tharaka was produced with a low budget. There is no intention to make huge profits. Shooting of the film was done for a long period. As the director I tried to bring strong incidents into the film. Curiosity is there throughout the film. The spectators may feel that in various ways. This is the main source of attraction towards the film.
Q: Why are story based films suitable for the country
Once Dr Tissa Abeysekara stated that our film spectators still prefer story based films. Therefore I wanted to tell the story while arousing curiosity. I tried to build characters accordingly.
Q: Jagath Chamila stars in a creation of yours after many years.
Yes, I have to specially mention about him. He acted in a few of my first teledrams. He was nominated for the best upcoming actor award for his performance in my teledrama Hathe Wasama. This was the first time he was nominated for such an award.
Jagath is a talented actor. Although he was not awarded at that time he became popular as one of the most talented actors in the world after becoming the worlds best actor at the New York Film Festival. I have to specially mention the sacrifices he made for the first scenes of Hima Tharaka where Jagath acted the role of an old man. Other actors and actresses were also very supportive.
Q: Why have you moved away from the teledrama field for a long time
Now we do not get any satisfaction from teledramas. It has been heavily commercialized. Even though those days viewers could remember teledramas now we cant do so when we consider the number of teledramas telecast a day. We never made teledramas to earn money. We want to be satisfied with our creation. These days they dont even show at least the cast of some teledramas. That air time is also used to earn money by showing advertisements. We only know the beginning of a teledrama at the end of another only after the name is displayed on a corner on the screen. Can we be satisfied with a teledrama in which at least names of the artists are not shown
Q: Many critics say that the current trend in Sri Lankan films is artistic. What is your opinion
Those days films which had similar stories and parts were known as commercial films. They had hero, herione, villain, songs, dances and famous actors and actresses. Now not only in Sri Lanka, but also in Bollywood commercial films, the trend has changed. Most of the Bollywood films have a heart touching pattern now. With the development in education and technology the spectators have also changed. Thats why the present films have an artistic trend.
Q: Isnt there a crisis with imaginative commercial film makers
Films cannot be screened without considering its commercial level. As the film industry is an expensive industry each and every film should at least cover its expenses. If not film producers will not produce such films again. In the past many film producers made artistic films along with those that were attracted by the general public. Hence they engaged in the industry continuously though sometimes the artistic films failed.
People charge that commercial film directors with imaginative skills. They do not emerge now because the film industry has collapsed. Can you imagine that commercial film directors would come to a declined film industry which does not attract people and one which is full of losses Since films in the past made profits many gathered around films as an industry. Many successful commercial film directors emerged among them.

Chinas housing boom ends  as prices fall in top cities
Decline marks end to huge growth that saw values rise as much as 40% last year
House prices have fallen across most of Chinas hottest property markets for the first time in almost two years, marking an end to the enormous growth that saw prices rise as much as 40 per cent last year.
The end of the housing boom will also mean the end to an important source of economic growth that could have helped China hit its economic growth targets this year. We are seeing a peak in the property market..Last year was an incredible surge, said Shen Jianguang, chief economist at Mizuho Securities Asia. Prices of newly built residential properties dropped between 0.1 and 0.4 per cent in December from the previous month in 12 out of 15 hotspot cities, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday. Price rises in cities such as Shanghai and Beijing reached 5 per cent a month in August. Investors had piled into the housing market, especially after a dramatic stock rout in 2015, seeing property as one of a few options left for high returns on the mainland. However, their hopes were dashed when the government decided to quash potential asset bubbles last autumn. More than 20 city governments passed restrictions on house purchases and increased the minimum downpayment required for a mortgage.
Financial regulators also stopped property developers from borrowing to finance land acquisitions in an attempt to keep land prices down. Last month, Beijings mayor promised that house prices would not rise this year. Although many analysts expect property prices to fall at most 5 per cent year on year in the current downturn, local governments are ready to move to avoid sharper crashes.
Local governments do not want prices to decrease too much, said Mr Shen, explaining that governments restrict land supply to prop up property prices if they fall too quickly. The local government cannot endure less construction because then they will have no revenue, he added. Many Chinese local governments are dependent on land sales to meet their budget requirements.
If prices go too far one way, the government will introduce new policies, said James MacDonald, head of China research at Savills, a property consultancy in Shanghai. Chinas real estate and construction sectors made up a fifth of GDP growth in the first half of last year, according to Liang Hong, chief economist at China International Capital Corporation.
GDP data to be released will show how reliant Chinas economy was on property and related sectors.

Moving towards an ethical media culture
Lionel Wijesiri's story - Moving towards an ethical media culture (CDN June 27) is interesting.
The Yahapalana government may have 101 shortcomings, but it is to their credit that they managed to restore (to a large degree) media freedom.
Even the state controlled media now maintain a reasonable balance in their reporting. The state medias regular political talk shows often present the opposition viewpoint.
We have also seen how opposition party leaders ruthlessly criticise the government. This is a good sign of freedom.
With this new media freedom, it is the paramount duty of all media to adhere to the principle that media rights accompany and are inseparable from media responsibilities with equal significance given to both.
There also needs to be reverence for life, upholding non-violent conflict resolution, promoting national reconciliation, upholding and sustaining plurality in all its dimensions, respecting the rights of readers or audiences and advocating the inviolability of their privacy.
Are our media taking that responsibility I personally have my doubts. In his story, Lionel Wijesiri offers some suggestions which are well worth looking into.

Commercial diplomacy to the pinnacle
He most obligingly shared his art of governance with the Daily News, but artfully refrained from revealing the names of his most disliked political opponents!
Being a politician, I avoid that question. I have three or four who can be named, but I dont want to do so.
Ironically enough, as the government went for a Cabinet reshuffle in early May, barely five months after UKs Banker selected Ravi Karunanayake as the best Finance Minister of the Year, Asia Pacific 2017, he swapped his favourite portfolio with that of Mangala Samaraweera!.
No post is permanent, he agreed, But the concern I had was the mannerism in which it took place. The sudden and abruptness it happened certainly was very much to his surprise and beyond his comprehension, the newly appointed Foreign Minister reiterated.
However, now having established himself as Foreign Minister, Ravi Karunanayake said that his new role would be to ensure that Sri Lanka has a strengthened relationship with the entire world. He is geared up to carry forward the governments foreign policy- Friends with all, enemies with none.
Building bridges and moving forward should be our theme. Thats the policy that we would like to pursue with substantial weightage being given to commercial diplomacy that could basically be taken advantage of. he said. This would basically mean instead of aiding ourselves, we trade, and ensure that investments are established in the country. And likewise we need to diversify our exports - we need to have market diversification- and this is what we want to carry on, he emphasized.
New role
Commending his predecessors role in correctly projecting Sri Lanka internationally, Karunanayake stressed that his role would be to build further from there onwards with the assistance of the President and Prime Minister.
So my feeling is we are closer now than what we were and we would certainly strengthen that further.
Sri Lanka has already assured the UNHRC of her commitment to accountability and reconciliation. Immediately after the August 2015 Parliamentary Election, the government co-sponsored Resolution 30/1 titled Promoting Reconciliation and Accountability in Sri Lanka, which was adopted unanimously by the UNHRC, October 1, 2015.
As former Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera repeatedly emphasised this decision manifested the Governments open, sincere and proactive approach to dealing with Human Rights issues.
Minister Karunanayake expressed his commitment to reconciliation and rehabilitation in the post war Sri Lanka.
The Reconciliation process is on at the moment, and you could see a new constitution being looked at, and certain matters which were outstanding which were solved on the political platform are being put to test and also being discussed to be put into action. So my job is to steer clear from those areas and navigate it through all these trying circumstances that are there. But at the end of the day we must ensure that it is acceptable to all communities and also an improvement on what it was. That does not necessarily mean that it panders into the wants of many. It is wants of everybody that has got to be looked at.
Entry into politics
After having started his career as an accountant, Karunanayake entered active politics in the eighties.
I was working closely with Mr Lalith Athulathmudali, and in the 1980s he had a passion for getting young professionals coming in. Well, in the process we were discussing many matters. Following his sudden and untimely demise his wife took over the party. And on that basis there was an opportunity which came through the alliance in 1994 where Mrs. Athulathmudali was given the choice of two National List MPs. The vision of Lalith Athulathmudali was carried out by her. So that is the advent into it [politics.]
However, Karunanayake added that the role he played as a National List MP was a passive one. During a political debate which took place between Karunanayake and the late Minister Jeyaraj Fernandopulle over the privatization of SriLankan, the latter challenged him that he was a mere National List MP.
Do the same thing by getting elected, Jeyaraj said. That was an open challenge which was taken up.
In 2000, Ravi Karunanayake was elected to Parliament from the Colombo District receiving more than 145,000 votes.
He was among the Ten Outstanding Young Persons (TOYP) of the Year 1999. He was presented with the award for Young Outstanding Politician of the year in 1999 at the National event organised by the International Jaycees.
I am happy to receive it and I am sure that they selected me at that moment because I was performing good enough, he recollected.
As Karunanayake noted, the UNPs responsibility was thrust upon Ranil Wickremesinghe at a time nobody wanted to lead the party.
He had been blamed at every given moment that the UNP was in Opposition because of him. But he had the vision, the character, and he didnt dare the system like other unscrupulous politicians did. So thats how he is where he is and people have respect for him because of that. But I saw the (leadership) trait in him, that he was able to foresee things as a visionary, while others looked at such things from a personal level.
Lesser known qualities
Karunanayake calls himself a hard taskmaster.
I like to get things done and I dont accept fake excuses. And my answer is why cant you do this. Dont tell me it cannot be done, but how it can be done. That basically enables you to have a target that is achieved and if you do not set a target upon yourself you cant basically ensure the things are going forward, he said.
Politicians like Lee Kuan Yan, Margaret Thatcher, Dr Mahathir Mohamad and Tony Blair had foresight and aspiration to take their respective countries forward. They provided clear guidelines and development targets for the country and ensured that all targets were achieved at the end of the given period.
Karunanayake said that having role models to look up to will enrich ones life.
I consider President J.R. Jayewardene as a role model. And what I have heard of Mr. SWRD Bandaranaike, but not associated. Also Lalith Athulathmudali for sure, he said.
Karunanayake also noted that sometimes he is at a disadvantage as a politician because he had mostly been projected negatively by his political opponents.
Well, unfortunately people think I am snooty and unapproachable, but once they meet me, the entire perception changes thereafter. My standpoint is that we have not inherited anything, but we are all self made and on that particular basis if we can do it why cant the others do it. I want to be a voice to the voiceless. That was when I came into politics, Minister Karunanayake emphasized.
He sees himself as a friendly person. I am a very friendly person by nature. Until somebody tries to hit me or stab me from behind, I basically accept them at face value - as being good.
Politics is not a bed of roses. It is one of the worst things that can be done. But if everybody says that, then who is going to be there in the system Owing to the fact we have got an opportunity and the people have confidence in us, we want to challenge our opponents and tell them that it can be done, not that it cannot be done, and why it isnt being done.
During his tenure as Finance Minister, he motivated the entire ministry to work as a team.
When we are working very hard in the Ministry, some people think it is for the reason of corruption, others think it is because we want to have dominance. But theres also a group who makes the best use of the given opportunity. Through that I could motivate the entire Ministry to work as a team. And instead of a one man show that was there, it was converted from secretary downwards as a team - a family that was working towards achieving targets. And this annoyed many, because they dont work hard, but they are very willing to basically say there is corruption or inefficiency in the ministry, he said.
Explaining his new plans as Foreign Minister, in addition to commercial diplomacy, Karunanayake said when it comes to foreign policy he believes that there should be a much more proactive and forward thinking approach.
And that is what we basically have to have at this particular moment.
Vision
Sri Lanka is a gem in the world. And it is being exploited by a handful of unscrupulous guys, selling the country for nothing and we must work together to ensure that we are able to get it to a developed stage which can easily be obtained and thats the reason why Id love to see things happening here.
Karunanayake wants him to be seen as a common person with the people.
Not above or below, but with them. This is the fallacy that did exist owing to the fact that my political opponents have been projecting me in a wrong way. Out of 24 years, almost 18 years we have been in the Opposition. So when you make political strides they try to hit you down by either malicious practices or malicious media campaigns. I am a victim of such propaganda and to prove otherwise, it takes time. It is only now they see the reality, he added.
His fervent message/request for the youth of the country is not to throw away the opportunity that is before them.
You have a bright future. So ensure that you have the confidence and give us the opportunity to deliver this to you, he said.
The country has the best opportunity with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe working hand in glove. On the 8th of January there were a few who came along with President Maithripala Sirisena and worked around with the majority UNPers and formed the government. Since then we are a Unity Government in operation. But that does not mean that anybody who came subsequently (who are trying to basically play double games on President Maithripala Sirisena) and trying to bring distrust between the Prime Minister and the President needs to be tolerated. The younger generation have confidence in President Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe, he added.
As he emphasized the youth needs their own future to be guided.
They dont need to be living on subsidies, they have to got to have an economic environment that they dont have to run after politicians to get their job done. Stand on your own feet is what we want and thats what we are heading towards. Sometimes sunshine stories are easily sellable, but the quality of that is only long felt thereafter. We have delivered what we said, unlike others who merely talked and not delivered.
When asked as to why the young are not too keen to take up politics, he said the younger generation despise politicians because everyone is a bigger rogue than the other!
I think some of our political colleagues need to upgrade themselves because the degradation, that has been taking place since the late 60s and early 70s has had a spillover effect. And today if you are known as a thug or a rogue that is a politician! A very few that are in there try to change this. And they are sometimes hammered and character assassinated out of proportion.
My overall message to our citizens is we have basically come through the roughest of times and been given an opportunity to spearhead this into a developed nation. This cannot be done in one day owing to the economic ruin that we have inherited. But that does not mean that we have to keep blaming the past. We have confidence that we have the vision, the will and the know how to take us to that developed nation that we want to build. This will not happen in a day, but most certainly we will be able to do it before 2020.
Life outside politics
Minister Karunanayake is a family oriented person.
The little time that is available I try to maximize with my family - wife Mela and three daughters.
My fervent hope is that whatever I can do for my children, will be done for the country, he assured.
He recollected his early days in life as the eldest in a family of two boys.
I have another brother younger to me. We were brought up in the estate environment. My father was a Superintendent of an estate in Ratnapura and then subsequently in Kalutara. He died when I was barely 12-years-old.
They faced an uncertain future following his fathers death.
There was a sense of insecurity. And that led into forcefully setting targets to get our jobs done. Well, we had a limited amount of assets that were inherited, but in general we had to strive to survive.
His mother who was a housewife until his fathers death decided to move to the hotel trade in order to ensure a happy and stable future for her sons.
Karunanayake first studied at St.Thomas College and then moved to Royal College and subsequently became a Charted Management Accountant. His brother is currently working overseas in the airline trade.
Other than politics and family, his love for music, sports and reading current affairs keep him occupied! He is an ardent cricket fan as well as a badminton player. During my school days I played for Royal College. I love music (western music overall and Sinhala Baila), but cant sing for toffees!
He prefers Chinese, Indian, spicy food and sweets and his favourite dish is crab curry.
I dont drink or smoke at all. he emphasized. My father used to drink very heavily, and the repercussions took a heavy toll on me.

Court orders CID to inform progress of investigation
Thajudeen murder case:
The Colombo Chief Magistrates Court yesterday ordered the CID to submit a further report in court on July 27 regarding the progress of the investigation into Wasim Thajudeen murder case.
When case came up before Colombo Additional Magistrate R.M.B.D.R.Weligodapitiya, two suspects former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake and former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Champika Perera were present in Courts.
They were arrested over their alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder and conspiring to commit a murder.
They are currently out on bail.
On July 27, 2015 the CID submitted to Court that the death of Thajudeen was not an accident but a murder.
While delivering the verdict, Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris on February 25, 2016 ruled that the death appeared to be a murder and ordered the CID Director to immediately arrest all suspects involved in the incident and produce them before Courts.
Thajudeen was killed, apparently, in a road accident in Colombo in May 2012.
The CID had informed court that investigations conducted so far had revealed that Thajudeens teeth had been broken, the bones in the pelvic region also broken and his neck pierced with a sharp instrument prior to his death.
The CID added that muscles in his legs had been cut with a piece of a broken class. Earlier, Police maintained that Thajudeen was driving to the airport and had lost control of his car and crashed into the wall of Shalika Grounds at Park Road, Narahenpita, and that his vehicle had exploded within seconds of the crash.

Culture, at what cost
A former senior Central Bank official has made an interesting observation that should engage the attention of not just our politicians but also those clinging to hidebound tradition and nationalist sentiment. Addressing an event the other day the ex-official said Sri Lanka has to wriggle itself out of its present fixation on culture and nationalist obsession if it is to forge ahead on the development front and integrate with the modern world. A deeper evaluation of the current situation revealed that the biggest reason why Sri Lanka is lagging behind is a need to change our cultural mindset to be more modern and hardworking, to think how education is delivered and to leapfrog four cycles of the industrial revolution in order to become relevant, the former Central Bank official stressed. He highlighted the example of Singapores forward-thinking mindset that allowed a small state to become a global economic powerhouse.
Like the former CB official noted, our national culture, sometime, have proved to be the bane of progressive thinking and sometimes THE single factor that has placed obstacles in the path to development. A country like Sri Lanka cannot afford the luxury of living on past laurels if we are to forge ahead in this modern era. Today, culture and politics have proved to be a heady mix for those bent on obstructing development plans that are beneficial to the country. For example, all protests and agitations we see today, and even in the past, more often than not, have had their genesis in culture or national pride. It is on this basis that we hear some politicians and Bikkhus shouting hoarse against the government with the allegation that it is disposing of national assets. These elements well know that the majority Sri Lankans have long been conditioned to give pride of place to culture and take pride in their nationalism. Hence they (the majority community) are ripe to be exploited, given this mindset, for cheap political gain and to the great detriment of the country in the current context. The recent protests seen in Hambantota against the port project and others of its kind are no doubt driven by this obsession with culture and the preservation of the status quo.
Sri Lankans are due for an awakening. While our national culture and identity no doubt should be preserved and protected, this alone should not be our obsession. Sri Lanka cannot survive on its own. We don't have oil, gold mines and the type of natural resources that would make us self sustainable. The country needs to engage with the outside world and, what is more, we need foreign assistance if we are to move forward with the rest of the world. Sri Lanka cannot live a frog in the well existence merely because we need to protect our culture and national values. One recalls how a band of Buddhist monks stormed a cricket ground in Colombo where an international tournament was to be held demanding that the dancing girls we are accustomed to seeing in other countries at cricket matches, be dispensed with, since this impinged on our cultural values .The organisers had no option but to substitute the glamour girls with our own Kandyan dancers. Needless to say, this took away the gloss off the tournament which invariable died a natural death.
This incident, no doubt, mirrors what is today taking place in the country in the name of culture and national pride where all that is alien to us is shunned, bringing with it dire economic consequences. It is also in this light that the present public/private partnership agreements that are to be entered into by the government to defray debt repayment are being viewed by the public, influenced by bankrupt political elements.
Now that a much respect professional banker has hit the nail on the head, so to speak, as to what is holding back the country from forging ahead, it is incumbent on all politicians to act with circumspection for the progress of the country. The country should move away from the past and accept the hard realities. It is this very obsession with culture and nationalist mindset that made the country stagnant even after seven decades of independence while India which too boasts of a rich civilisation has forged ahead unfettered by cultural restrictions.
The Yahapalanaya government, should, therefore, while dedicating itself to preserve and protect Sri Lanka's culture and national outlook should divest itself of all hangovers when it comes to making Sri Lanka a modern state ala a Singapore. It is the SLFP element in the Yahapalanaya government which had all along accorded pride of place to national culture and represented the voice of the majority in this regard. It is hoped that its alliance with the more business oriented UNP would lead to a change in mindset to jointly take the country on the path of development and progress and the creation of a modern Sri Lanka.

Despicable Me's third time loses the charm [Video]

Gru's family keeps growing while the franchise's charms keep shrinking in "Despicable Me 3," a fairly laborious and chaotic addition to the hugely popular animated series.
While the central character discovers that he has, perhaps inevitably, an evil twin, the fraternal bonding that ensues isn't despicable as much as simply tiresome.
The cleverness that characterized the original film -- with Steve Carell as the villain whose hardened heart gets melted by a trio of orphans, and the colorful Minions stealing the show -- feels seriously diluted this time around.
Indeed, the writers actually have to concoct a separate plot involving the Minions, whose future as a solo act might be considerably sunnier than the flagship title at this stage.
Foremost, this third installment feels as if it's trying to jam too much into its relatively modest length. Not only is there a new over-the-top villain -- a former child TV star, Balthazar Bratt, voiced by "South Park's" Trey Parker -- but Gru tries to connect with his long-lost brother Dru (also Carell), while Gru's wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig) seeks to prove her mothering credentials to her stepdaughters.
Dru, moreover, has been raised in the faraway land of Freedonia (one suspects referencing the Marx Brothers will largely be lost on the target demographic), which temporarily shifts the action there.
Eventually, the climax takes place in Hollywood, amid a fair amount of carnage as Bratt plots revenge against the town that discarded him.
Those rather inside jokes notwithstanding, unlike the Pixar movies the appeal to adults feels limited.
Even the kids in attendance during an advance screening seemed notably antsy, perhaps because of the semi-arid stretches between the big slapstick and vaguely naughty sight gags that the gibberish-spouting Minions in particular provide, including a peculiar foray that lands them in prison.
Frankly, there's room for sympathy toward the stewards of such an enterprise, faced as they are with the challenge of piling fresh elements upon what already exists.
The result, however, is an inordinately busy movie that yields a few amusing and even sweet moments -- a la Gru's young daughter and her quest to find a unicorn -- that are largely snowed under by the loud and obnoxious ones.
So while the first movie was, as noted, at its core rather charming, for "Despicable Me," the third time definitely isn't the charm.

Dilemmas and opportunities in Asian tourism boom
Two bare-chested Russian tourists sporting orange swimming shorts play frisbee on the beachfront of a popular hotel in Negombo, a resort town in Sri Lanka's western coast. A short distance away, Greek holidaymakers sip coconut water at an open-air cafe. Both groups have booked into established hotels facing the sea.
Tourist industry veteran Hiran Cooray welcomes such mainstream leisure travellers to the six hotels his company owns in the town. "Negombo is our main profit center," he said of his Jetwing properties, which provide 400 rooms catering to both high-end travelers and budget-conscious backpackers.
Cooray is bullish about the continuing demand from Western and Asian tourists for an "organized holiday, where you want breakfast served, rooms cleaned and a pool to take a dip in." Other operators agree, noting that Sri Lanka welcomed a record 2 million tourists in 2016, compared with just 500,000 in 2010, a year after the end of the bloody, three-decade civil war in this South Asian island state.
But as the country's industry crunches the tourism earnings numbers$3.7 billion in 2016 according to official dataa troubling reality is dawning: Not all the dollars are flowing to the formal tourism sector, in which hoteliers such as Cooray have invested heavily. "Nearly half of the tourists make travel plans and stay in rooms offered onlinehomestays, non-registered guesthouses, Airbnbthat are all part of the informal sector," said a tourism ministry official. Sri Lanka is not alone. Countries across Asia enjoying a boom in inbound tourism are grappling with this shift in travel habits shaped by smartphone-savvy tourists. The message was driven home at the annual Pacific Asia Travel Association summit, held in mid-May in Negombo.
Tourist dollars go online
The Asia-Pacific region received close to 600 million inbound tourists in 2016, the largest share of the 1.2 billion tourists who crossed international borders, conference delegates were told. Within that region, Asia received almost 436 million international arrivals, according to PATA's Annual Travel Monitor for 2017. But the new order shaping this growth is led by travellers who go armed with digital tools to "disrupt" the old order of organized holidays.
"The 45-65 age groups are shunning package travels and they are the largest group using Airbnb," said Rafat Ali, founder and CEO of Skift, a New York-based online supplier of global information on the travel industry.
Even restaurants are changing their designs and menus because of social media, he added, since "they want to make sure it looks good on Instagram."
The Indonesian resort island of Bali is basking in this unfolding social media disruption. TripAdvisor, the world's largest travel site, in April named the island, known for its warm seas, coral reefs and terraced rice paddies, as the world's best travel destination for 2017, based on travellers' reviews. Chinese visitors were a pivotal influence on Bali's triumph, with Bali-related online searches increasing 73% year-on-year, according to TripAdvisor.
"Travellers want a lot of information and a lot of content before choosing destinations," said Sarah Mathews, head of destination marketing for Asia-Pacific at TripAdvisor. The site's online reviews of travel destinations have surged to 500 million, and it says 390 million monthly unique visitors use TripAdvisor to "search and plan trips." But this picture of success is open to debate. Framing it is a question many travel industry insiders in Asia are grappling with: how do you measure the economic impact of travel shaped by independent tourists who use digital tools to plan holidays that promise unique, local experiencesthe new mantra of leisure-seeking globetrotters "There is a need for a new economic model to measure how the new tourist trends contribute to economic growth," Mario Hardy, PATA's CEO, told the Nikkei Asian Review.
There are ample figures to mine from tourist industry earnings, which contribute significantly to gross domestic product across many Asian countries. Total tourism earnings across the Asia-Pacific region in 2016 amounted to $2.27 trillion, accounting for 9% of the region's GDP, according to a March report by the World Travel and Tourism Council, a London-based network of travel industry leaders. "(It) is forecast to rise by 5.8% in 2017, and to rise by 5.7% ... to $4.17 trillion (10.7% of GDP) in 2027," the WTTC noted.
Tourism earnings in 2016 in South Asian and Southeast Asian economies illustrate the good times. The total in the Maldives, a necklace of resort islands in the Indian Ocean, was $2.6 billion, estimated to account for 79.4% of GDP, while India raked in $208.9 billion, equal to 9.6% of GDP, according to the WTTC report. Thailand's total tourism earnings hit $82.5 billion, equal to 20.6% of GDP, while Malaysia's total earnings were $40.4 billion, or 13.7% of GDP.
Other measures suggest why some Asian destinations are riding high on the global tourist wave, with the top destinations enjoying 10% growth in overnight stays between 2015 and 2016.
An annual assessment by MasterCard, the credit card company, placed Bangkok as the most visited destination in 2016, with 19.3 million arrivals. Singapore was second, with 13.1 million, followed by Tokyo with 12.6 million, Seoul with 12.4 million and Kuala Lumpur with 11.3 million, according to the MasterCard Asia Pacific Destination Index 2017.
Tourists spent liberally during their holidays, MasterCard said. Travelers from China (17.7%) and South Korea (8.8%) were the largest contributors to tourism expenditure. Their appetites for "new shopping or culinary experiences" were leading indicators in spending patterns in Singapore, which topped the MasterCard rankings for Asia Pacific destinations by tourism spending. Travellers spent $15.4 billion in the city state, followed by $12.7 billion in Bangkok, $11.1 billion in Tokyo and $9.9 billion in Taipei.
Travel industry leaders credit regional governments for these stellar numbers. "When you talk to presidents or prime ministers in Asia, they take pride in the tourism sector," said Taleb Refai, secretary general of the World Tourism Organization, a United Nations agency.
"They know how important tourism is for their economies and have taken initiatives, so the degree of dependency on tourism is high."
That could also mean targeting Airbnb, the global network that offers local homestay accommodation at bargain prices. After allowing the San Francisco-based company to thrive in an informal travel market, plying adventurous globe-trotters with new destinations, some governments are wising-up.
"We are working with governments to figure out tax issues [related to Airbnb services]," Thao Nguyen, head of strategic partnerships at Airbnb's Asia-Pacific office, told the PATA conference.
Analysts expect these "sharing economies," as Airbnb services are described, to shift the balance of taxation in Asia as the social media market expands. They say that Asian governments may take a cue from travel destinations in France and America, where Airbnb's accommodation services are already taxed, as a way of regulating its activities. That would guarantee tourism's place as a dependable money-spinner in Asia. (Nikkei Asian Review)

Donald Trump raising funds for re-election bid
With over 1,200 days to go:
US: The next US election is still more than 1,200 days away, but Donald Trump is already drumming up cash to pay for his campaign -- and chose the Trump International Hotel, two steps from the White House, as a fundraising venue.
On Wednesday, the 45th President of the United States took part in a dinner benefiting the Republican Party and his own re-election bid, with a seat at the table reportedly starting at $35,000 -- and rising to $100,000 for super donors.
The White House is upfront about the presidents intention to seek a second term.
Of course he is running for re-election, Trumps spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters Wednesday when quizzed on the topic.
But right now, he is focused on his agenda, focused on the midterms, and raising money for the party, she said. I dont think thats abnormal for any president. The US leader himself has often referred to his plans for the eight years to come.
While the phenomenon leaves many uncomfortable, it has long been part of American political life for the president to contribute star power to fundraising events -- be it for his party or his own cause.
But in the case of the business mogul-turned-president Trump, things are a bit more complicated: the rich donors come to hear to him speak Wednesday night were contributing not only to his future campaign, but to his real estate empire as well.
Around 200 Democratic lawmakers recently sued the president, arguing that he is violating the Constitution by accepting foreign payments through his empire of hotels, golf courses and other properties.
A separate suit filed by the attorneys general of Maryland and the US capital claims the Trump International Hotel, which opened a few weeks before the November election, enjoys an unfair advantage over rival venues due to its links to the presidency.
Both lawsuits are underpinned by the notion that Trump is embroiled in a permanent conflict of interest, having failed to put sufficient distance between himself and his business empire: while the billionaire has entrusted his sons with day-to-day management of the Trump Organization, he retains his full stake.
The plaintiffs note, for instance, that foreign delegations regularly opt to stay at Trumps hotel when in Washington, that foreign governments have chosen to buy or rent property built by the Trump Organization, or that Chinese authorities have registered Trump-owned trademarks. - AFP

A Fairytale with a Difference
June, 19th,2010. Inside the Stockholm Cathedral, 1,200 royal guests and dignitaries watch the fairytale wedding, albeit a slight twist, along with 500,000 people who lined the streets, and an estimated 500 million TV viewers from around the world. Yet the princess only has eyes for her groom, a former fitness instructor from a village in the forests of central Sweden, as she calmly speaks her vows, tenderly wipes a tear from his eyes after exchanging rings, and at one point, even winks at him during the service.
The whole event had a tinge of fairy magic in it, except that this time it was a beautiful princess who whisked her prince away from humdrum ordinary life to a magical world of palaces and balls. In his extraordinary courtship with Crown Princess Victoria, the villager whose mother worked as a clerk at the post office and whose father was a manager at a municipal social services center had received the modern equivalent of the kiss that turns the frog into a prince - careful grooming by courtiers, language tutors and a public relations agency. Eight years after he met her, he was transformed into a sophisticated, modern young royal ready to marry the Princess who will one day wear the crown.
Princess Victoria first met Daniel Westling during a session in his Stockholm gym. She was a troubled princess at the time recovering from the breakup of a long relationship and training at the gym to fill her empty hours, as well as to help overcome a serious eating disorder. (making this the best met-on-the-treadmill love story ever heard.) He was first pictured in Swedish newspapers in 2002 looking startled at the attention of paparazzi, wearing jeans, with his long hair poking out from under a baseball cap. Even worse was his rural accent, the subject of cruel jokes among Victorias blue blood friends. Adding fuel to the fire, her father, the authoritarian King Carl XVI Gustav, 64, was dead set against their relationship. His precious daughter was lined up for a Danish prince with impeccable lineage and the king was determined not to admit a tongue-tied commoner from the forests into the royal fold. The pressure was so great that in 2004 their relationship entered a crisis that nearly ended it. But Victoria stuck to the path of true love. Daniel learned enough etiquette to get by in high society, with the assistance of a committee of courtiers who were dubbed princes school. After the courtiers taught him how to eat, what to say, how to stand, he had evolved into the perfect prince. Now with the suit and tie and designer glasses he looks like a stockbroker, said Sten Hedman, an author who has followed the Royals closely since 1962. The transformation is remarkable  he is barely recognizable from the young man we saw in 2002.
On the day of the wedding, the radiant and beaming 32-year old bride walked down the aisle on the arm of her father, the king, in a cream-colored duchess satin gown with short sleeves and an off-the -shoulder, rounded neckline. Designed by Pr Engsheden, the dress had a V-shaped back and a 16.5-foot train fastened from the waist. Topping off the look, as everyone predicted, was the Cameo tiara which the brides mother, Queen Silvia, also wore to her own wedding on the same day in 1976. Made of gold, pearls, and cameos, the tiaras center cameo depicts Cupid and Psyche from Greek mythology. Cameo drop earrings and a cameo and pearl bracelet completed the look.
The bridesmaids, two of whom are Victorias royal god-daughters, wore pearl-white, silk organza dresses with roll collars and ballet slippers. Princess Catharina-Amalia of the Netherlands and Princess Ingrid-Alexandra of Norway - both six years old, and future queens themselves - held hands as they walked down the procession. The page boys, which included four-year-old Prince Christian of Denmark, wore sailor suits - a Bernadotte royal family tradition.
When the clock struck midnight in the gilded ballroom of Stockholms Royal Palace on June 19th, Prince Daniel led his princess in the first waltz of the evening, as an audience of Europes royalty looked on approvingly.
To quote Hedman, It was like a fairytale - she kissed her gym trainer and she got a prince. - Aditha

Gated community living becoming popular in suburban  of Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka has been rapidly developing since the end of a three-decade civil war. The political stability of the country and its infrastructure development has helped the economy progress over the last few years. In addition, the growth in non-traditional industries such as Apparel, Information Technology and Tourism have all contributed for Sri Lanka to be an Emerging Hub in Asia.
Historically there has been a strong correlation between urbanization and GDP per capita especially in emerging countries. Rapid urbanization continues to impact the Sri Lankan economy. The economic growth of the country and overall infrastructure development has made local and international investors to actively seek out opportunities in the real estate sector. This transformation has resulted in both the demand and supply of housing, retail and commercial spaces to increase year on year.
Though the key focus has been within the economic hub - Colombo - several residential and commercial projects have gradually begun targeting the suburbs and other districts. This exemplifiesthat investors see the potential, not just in the commercial capital, but in what Sri Lanka has to offer as a whole, especially in terms of real estate and the property industry.
If we focus on the residential segment of the Western Province of Sri Lanka in particular, the demand for property and housingis continuously on the rise. This has also resulted in property prices to virtually sky rocket due to the natural scarcity of land. As a result, suburban areas in the Western Province such as Dehiwala, Mount Lavinia, Wattala,Negombo, Battaramulla, Nawala, Kaduwela, Rajagiriya, Thalawathugoda, Homagama, Athurugiriya, Malabe, Moratuwa, Piliyandala andPanadura has seen a renewed interest by both prospective buyers and developers. This is due to its lower price compared to Colombo City limits, visible improvements in infrastructure and also overall level of economic activity. From a Sri Lankan perspective, these areas can be referred as Tier II cities.
An interesting trend evolving in Sri Lanka is the concept of Gated Communities or Gated Living. This concept has been very popular across the world with countries like Malaysia embracing it in the early 1990s. This concept is not new for Sri Lanka either but what is clearly evident is that the trend is towards suburban areas with a smaller number of units typically 10 -20 in total. Over the years many authors have attempted to define the concept of Gated Communities.
In the simplest form, a Gated Community is a physical space or development which has restricted access to outsiders whilst having a common code of conduct among tenants (residents) within the development. A typical development therefore, may be surrounded by fences, walls, or other natural barriers that limit the access to people who are not part or residents of the development. A Gated Community Development can include Town Houses, Duplex Units, Semi-Detached Houses, Bungalows, Villas and also Apartments. However, there are some design and functional characteristics that differentiate a Gated Community or Gated Living development with other residential developments. The main characteristics are as follows:

1) Increased Emphasis on Security  The prime consideration of any gated community is security. From the starting point or entrance of the development to the individual residential units, security and safety is managed through physical personnel and the use of technology such as CCTV cameras and IOT Based devices.
2) Integrated Facilities  Gated Communities often have common internal roads, recreational facilities such as a swimming pool, clubhouse facilities, mini-mart, gymnasium, walking paths, a common park(s), round the clock maintenance, childrens play area etc.
3) Lifestyle Based Living  Gated Communities often have people who have similar lifestyle preferences and aspirations. Most Gated Community developers allow prospective buyers the flexibility to customize their units which may not necessarily be the case with an apartment complex.
4) A Quiet Living Experience  Gated Communities are well known to offer a quiet and serene environment in comparison to the noise, pollution and traffic associated with a typical city development.
Research conducted by Paramount Realty recently identified opportunities for growth and development in Tier II cities and believes that these cities provide significant opportunities for both developers and investors.
Paramount Realty focuses on bringing the affordable living concept to these emerging cities through novel concepts. Inspired by a vision to be the market leader in providing innovative real estate solutions, Paramount identifies the need to fulfil the emerging trend for Gated Communities/Living in suburban Sri Lanka. Therefore, the company will be launching two Gated Community projects in Panadura and Hokandara. These Emerging Tier II Cities have been selected due to its demographic and psychographic profiles, existing and planned infrastructure, close proximity to city limits and the overall demand for housing in these locations. Each of the Gated Community Projects of Paramount will have enhanced security features, common facilities, comfortable living spaces, functionality based design and modern amenities all at affordable price.
Paramount Realty is a real estate company in Sri Lanka that aims on redefining the industry. Under the leadership of industry experts, the company strives to provide real estate solutions with an unparalleled level of Service Excellence.
Paramount Realty exists by its mission to provide their customers quality real estate solutions by exemplifying a high level of professionalism, teamwork and ethics. For more information, please visit www.paramountrealty.lk.

Hemas Hospitals launches  Dengue Epa campaign on  World Anti-Dengue Day
With dengue hot spots in Sri Lanka experiencing a four-fold increase in infection, Hemas Hospitals multi-chain calls for personal action by citizens to be fully aware of and protect their families and neighbourhoods against the spread of Dengue.
The hospital launched a digital campaign and Facebook site titled Dengue Epa, on world Anti-Dengue day held on June 15, focusing entirely on awareness generation and education in all three languages. Dengue Epa Facebook posts will help teach public signs for early identification and detection of typical symptoms and of keeping surrounding areas and neighbourhoods clean and risk free of mosquito breeding, all as critical responsibility areas that all Sri Lankans should take notice of.
Dr Suneth Kumarapperuma, Consultant Community Physician, National Dengue Control Unit (NDCU) of the Ministry of Health participated at the simple launch event along with the leadership and senior members of staff of Hemas Hospitals.
Sri Lanka is currently facing a surge of the Dengue epidemic with the number of reported cases so far since the beginning of 2017 at 62,000 plus  thrice more than it was last year at the same time and the highest number recorded in Sri Lanka. Prompt treatment and action at hospitals have helped contain the fatality count; however the spread of the Dengue menace has not been controlled effectively.
Managing Director of Hemas Hospitals, Dr Lakith Peiris said that the hospital will take the dengue problem head-on. He emphasized that being pro-active is key to mitigating fatalities and noted that dengue in Sri Lanka is out of control - evident by the statistics. As responsible citizens and socially responsible organizations, we need to ask ourselves whether we contribute enough to help eradicate dengue. Everyone needs to be alert and work with the authorities to contain the problem he stressed. We at Hemas Hospitals as a responsible healthcare institution feel the need to play that role he added.
Dr Peiris said that the launch of Dengue Epa campaign today will have the potential to reach 5.4 million facebook users in this country. Im certain that this campaign will be very impactful to change the mindset of our people, to change their behavior and to take personal responsibility to fight this battle and also to pressurize the regulators, policymakers and administrators of Sri Lanka to be more cautious and mindful of this deadly disease.
The hospital multi-chain has geared itself to managing the growing numbers of patients. From antigen testing to closely monitoring clinical signs and preparedness in case of an escalation to dengue hemorrhagic condition, their team of qualified and experienced medical professionals is on hand and fully alert to promptly diagnose and start treatment.

I am with the protesters - President
Dammed Uma Oya:
investigation to be launched into swindlers :
Project launched disregarding professional advice :
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said that he sided with the public protesting against the Uma Oya Project.  I am on the side of the people. The people are justified in their uprising he said. He made these remarks at a ceremony held in Nuwaraeliya.
He further said that foreign specialists would be brought in the coming weeks to overlook the project and provide solutions. He also stressed that he would launch separate investigations soon against those who committed financial frauds through the Uma Oya multipurpose project.
The President added that the implementation of the Uma Oya project purely on politically motivated decisions disregarding the advice of eminent engineers had led to the present problem where people had to face unfavourable repercussions.
The people who took wrong political decisions and defrauded funds amounting to tens and thousands of millions during this project have maintained a stoic silence in the face of public protest against the project,he said He said that he hoped to launch a separate investigations soon against those who committed financial frauds through this project. President Sirisena said that although the government after assuming office considered the possibility of entirely stopping this project which earned stiff public opposition But he said he could not do so because almost two thirds of the prject had been completed by then and there was an immense debt burden involved owed to the Iranian Government which had to be repaid.
The President is expected to meet representatives of Peoples campaign against Uma Oya project in Colombo today. Digital infrastructure Development Minister Harin Fernando on Wednesday said that President has decided to intervene in this matter to provide a solution to this issue.
