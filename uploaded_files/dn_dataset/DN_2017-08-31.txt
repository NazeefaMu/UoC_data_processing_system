Daddy  gets a  Marathi  touch
Arjun Rampals biopic on Arun Gawli, titled Daddy, is touted to be among the most authentic gangster films to be made in Bollywood. The film aims to provide an intimate glimpse into the numerous chapters in the gangster-turned-politicians life. Directed by Ashim Ahluwalia, the makers have gone to great lengths to make the film look, feel and sound as authentic as possible. Gawli spoke Marathi at home and had Maharastrian friends, thanks to his neighborhood in Parel and Dagdi Chawl where he actually stayed. Keeping that in mind, Arjun and Ashim roped in Marathi actors to play key roles which were a plus since they easily slipped into the skin of their characters. Anand Ingale, who plays Babu Reshim, made his debut in Ajab Lagnachi Gajab Gosht, and is known for his comic timing in the show, Prapancha. Rajesh Shringarpure, who plays Rama Naik, has worked in several Marathi films, too. Nishikant Kamat, a celebrated actor and filmmaker, plays officer Vijaykar Nitin, who had a pivotal role in the gangsters life. Aazun kahi pahije ka
Daddy, presented by Wave Cinemas Ponty Chadha, Raju Chadha, Karta Entertainment and Kundalini Entertainment, releases on September 8, 2017.

Dont Be Silly Silly awareness drive from Unilever, Arpico
Unilever Sri Lanka and Richard Pieris Distributors, together carried out the Dont Be Silly Silly awareness drive to encourage shoppers to go greenby switching to the reusable Arpico - Unilever cobranded blue eco bags at Arpico Supercentre outlets islandwide.
The campaign, which was kicked off in early July, saw consumers being apprised of the environmental issues stemming from the use of polythene shopping bags and how this could cut down considerably by simply switching to reusable bags.
Offering further impetus to adopt the reusable bags, 5,000 bags were given away to shoppers of Arpico Supercentre. A number of shopping carts were preloaded with the reusable bags too to offer a more convenient shopping and check-out experience.
This switch led to the number of polythene bags being used during the 30 day period drop by about 100,000, thus eliminating a considerable volume of non-biodegradable waste from ending up in landfills.
At Richard Pieris, we are committed to minimizing the environmental impact of our businesses. Be it the launch of the reusable blue bags or the introduction of the Arpico Eco Privilege taxi and online delivery service, we have always strived to offer shoppers ever more eco-friendly choices,said Minodh de Sylva, Head of Marketing, Richard Pieris Distributors.
True to our core business philosophy of Doing Well by Doing Good, at Unilever, we seek to make sustainable living common place in all the markets we are present in around the world.
In line with this, we have partnered with Richard Pieris Distributors and their Arpico Supercentre stores on this initiative which encourages responsible consumption, said Aruna Mawilmada, Customer Development Director, Unilever Sri Lanka.
Coming at a time when the nation is grappling with a major waste management crisis, we are delighted to play a small yet significant role in helping reduce the amount of polythene waste ending up in landfills through this campaign. Inspired by the results achieved within the first month, our teams are charged up to help more Sri Lankan shoppers go green by cutting down on their usage of polythene shopping bags (silly silly bags).

Gone with  the Wind  branded as  insensitive
A cinema hall in Memphis, Tennessee has canceled the screening of the 1939 Hollywood classic Gone with the Wind as its content was deemed insensitive by the viewers.
The board at The Orpheum Theatre decided to take down the film after they received numerous comments that stemmed from a screening on August 11.
While title selections for the series are typically made in the spring of each year, the Orpheum has made this determination early in response to specific enquiries from patrons.
The Orpheum appreciates feedback on its programming from all members of the mid-south community. The recent screening of Gone With the Wind at the Orpheum on Friday, August 11, 2017, generated numerous comments. The Orpheum carefully reviewed all of them, read a statement from the theatre group.
The Victor Fleming-directed movie has also been dropped from next years planned summer cinema series.
The statement continued that since the movie was found to have hurt the feelings of a larger audience, the group will not showcase the title from now on, till further notice.
As an organisation whose stated mission is to entertain, educate and enlighten the communities it serves, the Orpheum cannot show a film that is insensitive to a large segment of its local population, the statement further read.
One of the users, who commented on the Orpheums Facebook page, called the film racist, while another remarked over news of the cancelled screening, saying slowly but surely, we will rid this community of all tributes to white supremacy.
Gone with the Wind, which won eight Academy Awards, including best picture and best director, features life on a Southern plantation during the Civil War and Reconstruction periods. PTI

I will fulfill January 8 mandate
SLFP Central Committee to decide in december :
NO PARTY CAN FORM GOVERNMENT ALONE:
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday assured that he would run the government until 2020, irrespective of who walks in and walks out.
Addressing a breakfast meeting with newspaper editors and media heads at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo yesterday, the President said he was confident that the unity government would continue until 2020, in accordance with the mandate he received at the Presidential Election in January, 2015.
Look at the composition of the current Parliament;The UNP has 106 seats and the UPFA has 95 seats. No one has a simple majority to form a government on their own. Any government, under the current circumstances, has to be a coalition government, the President said, while adding that the Central Committee of the SLFP will make a final decision in December on renewing the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the UNP.
However, I am confident that the current government will continue until 2020. If not, there has to be some coup or conspiracy! the President stressed.
Commenting on attempts to create divisions in the SLFP, the President said only the SLFP would sustain as a political entity.
Only the SLFP has a vision and a policy framework. The party is guided by them. Political parties with individual agendas cannot function in the long run, the President said, citing examples from the countrys post-independence political history.
Both the SLFP and the UNP struggled with internal issues in the parties.
In the early 70s, former UNP Leader J.R. Jayewardene showed inclination to join the United Front government. If not for the opposition shown by Felix Dias Bandaranaike and N.M. Perera, JR would have joined the Sirimavo Bandaranaike government.
During the Premadasa era, Gamini Dissanayake and Lalith Athulathmudali broke away from the government and formed a new party.The SLFP also had two breakaway parties namely the Sri Lanka Mahajana Party and the Bahujana Nidahas Peramuna. Before that, Rukman Senanayake formed his own party. These issues have been there for so many decades, the President explained.
He said the formation of a unity government was a new experience for both political parties who have been on the warpath for nearly seven decades.
Politicians of both parties have expressed remarks violating the collective responsibility of the government. In some instances, I have even warned some members of my party. But, it is clear that wrongdoers in this government will be severely dealt with, regardless of the party they represent.
The President said former Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was removed following a request by the UNP.
It is the nature of the agreement between the two parties. The two political parties should make final decisions on the ministries assigned to them. Even the decision to place the two lotteries boards under the Foreign Ministry was made based on the same policy, he added.

Local political climate wont deter foreign investors
The ongoing bond issue, appointment of a new finance minister and other political issues in Sri Lanka wont have a negative impact on foreign investors, said David Mann, Chief Economist, Asia, Global Research, Standard Chartered Bank.
They consider these developments as a black cloud which disappears soon.
He said that what the foreign investors are concerned about are good governance, carrying on the good work with regard to reforms and consistent policies laid by the government.
Mann said that they have observed that some of the top international companies who did not look at Sri Lanka before are looking at Sri Lanka now with renewed interest.
He said that the governments plan to have more private-public partnerships too is being welcomed by the international business community.
However the country only has two FTAs with India and Pakistan and we feel Sri Lanka must have more which in turn would help to increase exports.
He also said Sri Lankan FDI is currently low but is expected to pick up in 2018 1Q and really accelerate in the third quarter on 2018 onwards. The Port City project, proposed financial centre, as well the Hambantota Harbour project too would draw big time investors to Sri Lanka, he said.
Mann also said that they believed the government debt management direction was heading in the right way. Around US$ 900 million from the Hambantota Prot deal too would be diverted in this direction by next January.
Commenting on the latest events impacting the global outlook going into the second half of 2017, he said that the global economy is expected to pick up.
However we feel that the enthusiasm and optimism that was seen for US President Donald Trump before the election is now fading away as people feel that promises he made before the elections are not being delivered.
Meanwhile Saurav Anand, Economist Financial Markets, Standard Chartered, said that despite the GSP Plus advantage, Sri Lankas exports are yet to pick up at a healthy rate. He said that the Central Bank has brought in several meaningful steps including the increases of credit card interest rates in a bid to discourage imports.
We also feel that the currency depreciation is at a manageable level.
However he said that the Board of Investments revamping progress is taking a longer time than expected.

Im part of Hate Story 4. I had received a call from the production house first. I was kind of sceptical so, I said no as I didnt want to start my Bollywood career with a bold role, but when I had a second meeting with the team, I sat through the entire film narration, Ihana said in a statement.
After listening to the story and knowing more about my role in the film, I immediately said yes.
The films shooting is expected to begin from September.
Talking about her role, she said: My role is performance-oriented where acting is given more preference than just looks. Also, I couldnt ask for more as Hate Story (erotic thriller) itself is a very hit franchise and its a T-Series production with Vishal Pandya as the director.

All  about  Disappearances!
P.Pushpakanthans Solo exhibition titled Disappearance will be on exhibit at the Saskia Fernando Gallery daily from 10am to 6pm from 1 September 2017 to 19 September 2017.
Pushpakanthan first presented his work in a group show curated by his University Professor and established contemporary artiste Thamotharampillai Shanaathanan. The exhibition featured work by seven artists and was titled Seven Conversations. The exhibition consisted largely of his self narrative body of work focused on the struggle the artist experienced as a child and young adult during the war. It is in this series that Pushpakanthan first exhibited his drawing on paper, a medium and style he has continued with in this, his second solo exhibition titled Disappearance.
In an effort to evolve his practice and expression as a young artist, the work confronts the subjects of disappearance, reconciliation and the still pending closure for families whose loved ones have been missing since the end of the civil war.
This Disappearance series is about those who disappeared in the last war of Sri Lanka. People are still waiting for their loved ones. Children miss parents, parents suffer for lost children, and spouses grieve for their missing partners. Parents whose children were forcefully recruited to fight continue to suffer as many of them still have not returned. I believe disappearance is more of an emotional torture than a question of recovering the dead bodies of consanguinity. It concerns haunting memories, imagination and fear. Therefore, through this series, I try to express the fear and imaginative possibilities that grip the relations of those who went missing. Did they die a tragic death Are they still suffering somewhere The relations of those disappeared now have no answersnothing, but worries. Though they do not know whether their loved ones are suffering physical torture or not, those left waiting without knowing suffer real pain in their minds and bodies due to this gripping uncertainty, states Pushpakanthan.
Following his group show in 2015 Pushpakanthan went on to present his first solo exhibition at Paradise Road Galleries in 2016. His work has also been exhibited at the Serendipity Arts Festival in Goa, the Colombo Art Biennale, Colomboscope and group exhibitions curated by both Dr. Thamotharampillai Shanaathanan and Chandraguotha Thenuwara.

Asian Seven-a-side Rugby: Great opportunity for youngsters to show colours - Captain Muthuthanthri
Sri Lanka rugby sevens captain for the Asia Sevens Championship in Hong Kong, Sudarshana Muthuthanthri was very optimistic about Lankan young blood and said hopefully our youngsters will make this an opportunity to show their potential, despite many key players sans the tournament due to injuries when the first leg of the tournament starts at the King's Park stadium tomorrow.
The former Lankan sevens captain Dhanushka Ranjan along with Anuruddh Wilwara, Srinath Sooriyabandara, Richard Dharmapala and Shehan Pathirana were not included in the squad to Hong Kong due to injuries. Navy's Chanaka Chandimal also withdrew from the squad at the last moment on medical grounds. Adding salt to the wounds, one of Sri Lanka's finest fly half players, Fazil Marija did not make his presence in the side, citing his private commitments.
As a result Sri Lanka's U-20 Asian Sevens captain Naveen Heenakankanamege, Buddhima Piyaratne and Navy Sports Club's Sumith Dhananjaya will make their debut in the national squad. Chanaka Chandimal's last moment exit allowed Havelock SC's Kevin Dickson in. Dickson is a member of the 2016, U-20 Asian Sevens champion Sri Lanka team. The two-day fist leg at King's Park is tipped to be a tough one.
The Hong Kong event will be the selection trial to filter the best two teams for the World Rugby Sevens Championship which is to be held in America next year.
The Asian strong hold Japan and host Hong Kong are determined to make a successful initiative in Hong Kong for their World Sevens campaign.
Sri Lanka will play in the Group 'B' along with Japan, South Korea and Chinese Taipei while Hong Kong, China, Philippine and Malaysia will battle in Group 'B'.
According to Muthuthanthri, Japan and Hong Kong are in fine form with lot of experience and will be the biggest challenge for us. Both countries played in the last Sevens World Cup and also played many international matches since then.
" It is sad that several our top players did not make the tour to Hong Kong, But I think our youngsters will prospect on this great opportunity to prove their talent and make the country proud," he concluded.

Bangladesh to promote hybrid seeds production
Internationally renowned Lalteers Seed Production Company in Bangladesh has agreed to invest in Sri Lanka to promote hybrid seeds production and exchange of genetic resources.
There is a 300-acre land belonging to Mahailuppallama agriculture research and development institute not being used for project including cultivation for decades.
It is proposed to establish the hybrid seeds production plant complex in this premise. This is a joint venture involving Lalteer Company and the Agriculture Department, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
The Mahailuppallama seeds farm would not be sold to Bangladesh nor will it be leased out, he said.
It has been proposed to start a hybrid seeds exchange and production project at the Mahailuppallama agriculture research and development institute. Referring to this issue, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said there has been false propaganda by certain political groups to hoodwink the public.

Bangladesh shock Australia with historic Test win
Dhaka: Bangladesh Wednesday registered their first-ever win over Australia in Test cricket, beating Steve Smith's men by 20 runs in a thrilling match in Dhaka.
All-rounder Shakib Al Hasan took 5-85 to help the hosts dismiss Australia for 244 shortly into the second session on the fourth day.
David Warner top-scored with 112 for the tourists, who were chasing a victory target of 265 after dismissing the hosts for 221 in their second innings.
Shakib lived up to his billing as the world's number one Test all-rounder, finishing with a match haul of 10 wickets with his left-arm spin and making 84 in Bangladesh's first-innings total of 260.
Australia -- who are touring Bangladesh for the first time in more than a decade -- are currently ranked fourth to Bangladesh's lowly ninth in ICC Test rankings.
They appeared to be coasting towards their fifth consecutive Test win over the minnows when Warner and Smith resumed the day on 109 for two.
Warner, who was unbeaten on 75 overnight, reached his 19th Test century off 121 balls with two runs off spinner Taijul Islam.
But Shakib brought Bangladesh back into the game, dismissing both Warner and Smith (37) to put pressure on the tourists.
Pat Cummins hit a valiant 33 not out after Shakib bowled Glenn Maxwell (14) off the first ball of the second session, leaving Australia tottering on 199-8.
Cummins hit three fours and two sixes to bring his side achingly close to a win, but Shakib's spin partner Taijul brought the curtain down on the innings with his dismissal of Josh Hazlewood for nought.
Hazlewood, who was already nursing an injury, has been ruled out of the second and final Test of the series.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was watching from the stands, waved the nation's flag as the jubilant players embraced and celebrated their historic win.
"It's a great feeling beating Australia, and I think it was a great effort by the boys, especially Shakib," said captain Mushfiqur Rahim of his all-rounder, who was named man of the match.
"Our performance in home conditions has been pretty consistent and against England also we were very close in the first Test and we beat them in the second Test.
"That's the belief we had and also our spinners did a great job," he added, saying Bangladesh would now be looking to seal the series.
A dejected Smith said his men could have performed better with the bat in the first innings when they scored 217, since the bounce and spin proved especially devilish the second time around.
"It was a great Test match. Credit to Bangladesh, the way they played," he said.
"The first innings, I thought the partnership between Shakib and Tamim really set the game up for them. I thought we fought back really nicely after that.
"We probably let ourselves down a bit in the first innings with the bat. We probably needed to make a few more there."
Australia have not played a Test in Bangladesh since Ricky Ponting's team visited in 2006, six years after Bangladesh were granted Test status. They were due to play two Tests in the country in October 2015 but the tour was cancelled amid security fears after a wave of attacks by Islamist extremists in the Muslim-majority nation.
The second Test will be played in Chittagong from September 4-8. AFP

BOOK  REVIEWs
Tuan M Zameer Careems Persaudaraan- Malay Life in Sri Lanka will be launched on September 6 at the College of Surgeons, Noel and Nora Bartholomeusz Centre, No 06, Independence Avenue, Colombo 07.
It is truly a privilege to be invited by the author, Tuan M. Zameer Careem, to launch the rebirth of his second revised and enlarged published edition of PERSAUDARAAN: Malay Life in Sri Lanka (2017). My only exposure to the knowledge of Sri Lankan Malays thus far has been primarily provided by the writings of my personal scholar -historian friend, Dr. Bacha Husmiya, with whom I shared some productive postgraduate moments at Monash University, Melbourne and ended up together again recently as fellow academics working at the same University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD).
Tuan M Zameer Careems revised edition is certainly a labour of love and a work of meticuluous details, which is both historical and ethnographical. Specifically focusing on the different life aspects of the diasporic Malays in Sri Lanka, the book will undoubtedly provide many windows to the study of Malays in a comparative context. As an anthropologist researching into Malays in Peninsular Malaysia in the context of their changing cultural values and socio-economic transformation, I am excited about the possibilities of Zameer Careems book in providing comparative answers to some of the critical questions arising from this particular Malaysian discourse . For instance, how could we utilize the Malay Sri Lankan ethnographic and historical data base to engage in the counter-narrations against colonial knowledge or the colonial/post- colonial discourse on orientalising the Malays , as has been elegantly argued in S. Hussein Alatass The Myth of the Lazy Native (1977). Are there concrete markers of high achievement orientations amongst Malay subjects in Sri Lanka as a result of their diasporic environment How relevant is the nature of the debate pertaining to Malay development and underdevelopment in the Sri Lankan context These above questions pertaining to the many facets of being Malay remain critical research issues among scholars of contemporary Malay society in Malaysia.
As scholars, there is always something spiritual and intangible that binds us together. Within this epistemic community we occupy a similar knowledge-scape (after Appadurai) in which we share, collaborate (even contest) and exchange ideas. From the geographical location of the Malay world to which can be traced the genesis of Sri Lankan Malays, I speak on behalf of my Malaysian scholars in welcoming Tuan M Zameer Careems new birthing of his Malay Life in Sri Lanka.
Tuan M Zameer Careem is a fourth year Medical Student at National University, Ukraine. He is an Alumnus of Royal College, Colombo 07. He is a freelance journalist and a regular contributor to the local and International Print Media. His First scholarly tome, Persaudaraan- Malay Life in Sri Lanka (Firstt Edition) which was launched in 2016, is available for reference at the National Archives, Colombo, Stanford University Library, United States of America and at the National Libraries of Sri Lanka and Australia. His first edition was used as a reference by Professor Hussainmiya in writing the account on Malays for the anthropological tome titled Peoples of Sri Lanka published by the Ministry of National Coexistence, Dialogue and Languages, which was launched under the patronage of the President Maithripala Sirisena on the July 18 at the BMICH, Colombo. Tuan M Zameer Careem, is one of the few authors who have the distinction of their First Edition being sold out within a year of its publication. The foreword for the book was written by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

DEARTH OF BUDDHIST MONKS
It was reported, the Mahanayaka of Asgiriya Chapter most Ven. Warakagoda Dhammaasiddhi Pagnananda Gunarathana Thera, at a foundation laying ceremony for a building Sri Sumanaramaya temple at Nalanda, Matale had lamented the need to obtain the services of learned Buddhist monks towards the well-being of the country and the Buddha Sasana and the present social degradation is mainly due to the gap between the people and the temple.
In this regard, it is apt to quote a very courageous and bold observation made by an editor of another English daily where he correctly, with no ambiguity has said, referring to the accusation made by Ranjan Ramanayaka, State Minister against the clergy Certain Buddhist monks today openly engage in business activities, especially those temples in the cities and travel in luxury vehicles. More often than not, they receive political patronage to further their business ends, with some of them even holding important positions in government institutions, an act at complete variance with their primary duty to attend the spiritual needs of the faithful.
He also says Several temples in the country had been badly neglected due to the dearth of Buddhist monks. Could this be true, seeing large number of monks in cities housed in temples. Cannot the Mahanayaka Theras, take a census and appoint the excess to those neglected temples. While Buddhist monks in cities and towns enjoy these luxuries, monks in remote villages undergo untold hardships to serve innocent villagers.
The Mahanayaka speaks of obtaining the services of learned monks, perhaps not knowing what such educated monks have contributed to the destruction of Buddhism as in the case of Buddhist monks taking to politics and neglecting to perform simple religious rites and rituals such as tying a Pirith Noola, considering it as a nuisance and disrupting other work. Politicians have made the Sangha a tool to further their political power and misrule the country for personal gains as is evident. The most hilarious part is that these scheming politicians are given pride of pace at temple functions.
It is high time the Mahanayaka Theras and heads of Nikayas, get together, set up a Sangramaya to stem this rot in the Buddha Sasana for the sake of Buddhism and the country.

CSE to introduce REITs soon - CEO
The Colombo Stock Exchange will soon introduce a special tool to woo real estate sector investors. This is to be titled Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs).
Through this, investors could buy into the real estate market, said Colombo Stock Exchange CEO Rajeeva Bandaranaike. He was speaking at the Investor Forum Sri Lanka 2017, organised by Lanka Property Web.com.
Since their introduction in Asia in the early 2000s, REITs have been adopted across the continent, growing into a market worth over US$ 140 billion.
In terms of market capitalization, the most developed markets are currently Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong, but REITs have also been listed on the stock exchanges of South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand and Taiwan.
Currently, China and India are contemplating the introduction of REITs in those jurisdictions, whilst Indonesia and the Philippines have now got due legislation in place to provide the necessary framework for these products.
REITs came into existence in 1960, when the US Congress decided that smaller investors should also be able to invest in large-scale, income-producing real estate.
He said that the Colombo Stock Exchange after going through a lean patch is now on an upward trend and its ASPI continues to outperform most regional markets. This is also attracting more foreign buyers, he said.
Meanwhile, over 20,000 apartment units would be added to the Colombo city skyline in both the luxury and middle class segment, said Dwellings Group Director Theekshana Somaratne.
Speaking at the Investor Forum 2017, he said that there are 150 ongoing apartment projects.
He said that the growth of the property sector picked up with the dawning of peace and was then followed up by large infrastructure development projects which attracted expatriates and also tourism.
He said that mid-range apartments mostly patronised by young working couples would see further demand. The new laws which relaxed ownership regulations for foreigners also helped to swell the property market. We see an increase in demand in the Colombo surburbs and builders would take their projects outside Colombo in the future.
Although a presentation by the Board of Investment was scheduled, BOI representatives were not present at the designated time.

CSR Sri Lanka, WFP seek private sector recommendations on food security
More than 50 representatives from leading private sector agro and food processing companies came together to exchange ideas and provide recommendations on how to achieve food security and address nutritional issues in Sri Lanka at a forum organized by USAID-funded CSR Sri Lanka and the UN World Food Program (WFP), recently.
A core group was identified to continue engagement with the private sector companies in order to clarify the roles companies will have and to delineate expected outcomes that will be achieved in support of the UN's Sustainable Development Goal Two - Zero Hunger.
The goal of CSR Sri Lanka, a membership body initiated by USAID in 2013, is to ensure that the private sector engages in transformative corporate social responsibility (CSR) through meaningful stakeholder engagement and collaborative strategic planning for long term impact.
The discussion was moderated by Rizvi Zaheed, Managing Director of Hayleys Agriculture Holdings and tabled by Brenda Barton, Country Director of the WFP and Chandula Abeywickrama, Chairman of CSR Sri Lanka, together with several other representatives from the private and public sectors alike.
Laksiri Nanayakkara of the WFP, Sashrika Jayasinghe of the WFP and Maree Bouterakos from the UN FAO, in their presentations brought to light the problems in food security and nutrition that affect the Sri Lankan population.
The panel allowed a number of experts in their respective fields to raise their concerns related to food security and nutrition and to learn more about how they can work to improve the food security status in Sri Lanka.

Dambatenne Group  Haputale receives Rainforest Alliance certification
The Rainforest Alliance (RA) is a growing network of farmers, foresters, environmentalists, economists, scientists and businesses dedicated to conserve biodiversity and ensuring a sustainable livelihood.
The organizational logo of Rainforest Alliance certification features a 'green-frog'.
The green-frog is a Rainforest Alliance certification seal and it indicates that a farm forest or any other agricultural enterprise has been audited to meet the demanding environmental and social standards.
The RA certified seal is found on food and beverages in restaurants, supermarkets, hotels, airlines around the world and it gives the customer the satisfaction and assurance that the product to be consumed has been audited to meet requisite standards.
Plantation companies in Sri Lanka have been quick to realize that especially in the production and sale of tea, which is classified as a food beverage, at the point of sale carry a certification like Rainforest Alliance, if it is to be accepted on the shelves of food stores, hotels etc. The endorsement made in the tea weekly catalogue indicates that the tea buyers will be reluctant to make a purchase of an individual garden mark on its standing alone.
The time has come where each garden mark is called upon to carry evidence of certification such as RA, if it is to remain in business.
The parameters of RA certification demands mandatory major and minor conformities and improvement in many indicators relating to the significant protection and enhancement of the environment.
The tea plantations of Agarapatana and Kotagala Plantation Companies have undertaken initiatives such as inventory of biodiversity on estates recording animal siting, raising awareness amongst the staff and workers of the estate community in the establishment of non-chemical and buffer zones around water bodies and periodical checking of water quality including wastewater that finds its way into major waterways.
Reduction of the chemical usage even below stipulated standards with special training, detailed inventory of agro-chemical usage with training of agro-chemical handlers, implementation of a well organized integrated waste management system and a well defined sustainable environmental management are factors for certification.
Dambatenne Group is making a tangible contribution to boost national efforts aimed at protecting areas including stream reservations and natural forests with action taken to support growth in biodiversity. For instance, increase in the tree canopy and crop diversification has led to growth of different types of habitat, conducive to different species accompanied by biodiversity protection measures.
The journey for rainforest certification commenced in the year 2012 on Dambatenne Estate, Haputale, where initially they qualified for a group certification with Pitaratmalie and Beauvais Estates.
The Manager of Dambatenne Estate was D R Madena (presently the Director of the Uva region) and under his leadership, Dambatenne Group was able to establish excellent standards to fulfill all rainforest audit requirements. Since then the good work continues with the new General Manager H.M.S. Kahatapitiya and further improvements have been acknowledged.
Dambatenne Eastate was encouraged when the initial audit achieved a group success rating of 91%.
Since then, certification was obtained on Haputale and Kahagala Estates in the Haputale Region, Diyagama East, Balmoral, Glasgow, Holmwood and New Portmore Estates in the Agras region and Yuillefield, Drayton, Craigielea, Stonycliff and Derryclare Estates in the Kotagala region.
The fact that for all these plantations RA audits recorded a success rating over 90% is an indication of the commitment and dedication of the senior executives, staff and workers of these 15 plantations, the standard of work done, results achieved and commitment a worthy cause.
The concept of rainforest conservation has now become a way of life of the staff workers and executives on the Group's plantations.

This nine course dinner menu has been divided into three distinct styles/periods based on their lunch, dinner and the one-off Hokkaido experiment they did in December 2016. It has been designed in the hopes of offering a clearer picture of their culinary evolution, very much like an artists retrospective exhibition. This wonderful experience is met at Jetwing Beachs Black Coral, offering an unmatched fine dining experience in Negombo.

Fight the flaws
Breakouts are a nuisance to say the least, and discovering the best means of dealing with them is no easy feat. Spots, zits, pimples, whiteheads, blackheads, cysts, pustules, papules  call them what you like  are unsightly, irritating, painful and disruptive to self confidence. From putting toothpaste on our faces, to scraping and picking away at our skin many of us have tried some relatively unadvisable things in a bid to decrease the number of spots dotting our faces. Zero in on the zits with some acne-fighting tricks.
Best way to treat acne
Treatment for mild acne (whiteheads, blackheads, or pimples) may include gentle cleansing with warm water and a mild soap. Washing once or twice a day with a mild cleansing bar or liquid will keep the skin clean and minimize sensitivity and irritation.
Use exfoliating cleansers and masks. A variety of mild scrubs, exfoliants, and masks can be used. These products may contain salicylic acid in a concentration that makes it a very mild peeling agent. These products remove the outer layer of the skin and thus open pores.
A dermatologist can prescribe stronger medications or other therapies. Acne medications work by reducing oil production, speeding up skin cell turnover, fighting bacterial infection or reducing inflammation which helps prevent scarring.
The drug your doctor recommends depends on the type and severity of your acne. It might be something you apply to your skin (topical medication) or take by mouth (oral medication). Often, drugs are used in combination.
Applying acne cream
Acne cream should be distributed to the acne prone sites such as the forehead the nose the cheeks and the chin and should be applied evenly all over the face. Leaving too much in one area can cause to over dry the skin.
Prevent further acne breakouts
Keep your face clean - Its important to wash your face twice daily to remove impurities, dead skin cells, and extra oil from your skins surface. Use warm, not hot, water and a mild facial cleanser. Using a harsh soap (like deodorant body soap) can hurt the already inflamed skin and cause more irritation.
Avoid harsh scrubbing - Wash your skin gently with a very soft cloth or your hands. Always rinse well, and then dry your face with a clean towel.
Moisturize - Many acne products contain ingredients that dry the skin, so always use a moisturizer that minimizes dryness and skin peeling. Look for noncomedogenic on the label, which means it should not cause acne. There are moisturizers made for oily, dry, or combination skin.
Try an over-the-counter acne product - These acne products dont need a prescription. Most of them have ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or lactic acid, which curb bacteria and dry your skin. They may cause drying or peeling so start with a small amount at first. Then you can adjust how much you use and how often.
Use makeup sparingly - During a breakout, avoid wearing foundation, powder, or blush. If you do wear makeup, wash it off at the end of the day. If possible, choose oil-free cosmetics without added dyes and chemicals. Choose makeup that is labeled as noncomedogenic.
Watch what you put on your hair - Avoid using fragrances, oils, pomades, or gels on your hair. If they get on your face, they can block your skins pores and irritate your skin. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner. Oily hair can add to the oil on your face, so wash your hair often, especially if youre breaking out.
Keep your hands off your face - Avoid touching your face or propping your cheek or chin on your hands. Not only can you spread bacteria, you can also irritate the already inflamed facial skin. Never pick or pop pimples with your fingers, as it can lead to infection and scarring.
Stay out of the sun - The suns ultraviolet rays can increase inflammation and redness, and can cause post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (dark discoloration). Some acne medications may make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. Limit your time in the sun.
Feed your skin - Avoid greasy food and junk food and add more fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains to your diet. Avoid dairy products and foods high in processed sugar which may trigger acne.
Exercise daily - Regular exercise is good for your whole body, including your skin. Avoid wearing clothing or using exercise equipment that rubs your skin and may cause irritation. Shower or bathe right after exercise.
Reduced stress - Stress can be linked with the severity of pimples or acne. It has been noted that there is an acne flare up when stress in on the rise.
Tips to prevent acne scars
l Wash your face twice a day - Prevent acne breakouts that lead to scarring by keeping your face clean. Use warm water and a mild soap to wash your face in the morning, at night and after working out.
l Do not squeeze or pick at pimples - If you have acne breakouts, try not to touch the skin. Squeezing and picking your pimples can lead to scarring.
l Avoid the sun - Wear sunblock if you must go out in the sun. The suns ultraviolet rays cause damage to your skin and increase the appearance of acne and acne scars.
l Go tropical - Try using topical acne treatments that include benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid to get rid of the acne you have on your face before it can cause scarring.
l Consult a dermatologist - See a dermatologist to treat severe acne. Take oral antibiotics, prescription-strength topical creams or cortisone injections which could help get rid of your acne and prevent scarring.
Simple home remedies for acne scars
l Use lemon Juice as it is a natural bleach. Vitamin C in lemon helps in rebuilding collagen. Take a fresh lemon and squeeze out its juice. Apply this juice directly on your scars with finger tips or a cotton ball, leave it for ten minutes and wash it off with water. Do this once a day for two to three weeks during which you can see your scars diminish considerably. If you want, you can also mix honey with your lemon juice to make it some more effective in reducing the acne scars.
l If your skin is very sensitive, dilute lemon juice by mixing some rose water and then apply on your scars.
l You can even mix a teaspoon of lemon juice with two teaspoons of Vitamin E oil and then apply this to your acne scars. Vitamin E is a very good emollient with lots of antioxidants that protects and even improves your skin texture.
l Apply honey on the scars and leave it overnight and wash off in the morning. You could also add  tsp. of cinnamon powder with 1 tbsp. of honey and apply on scars. Leave it for an hour. You can even use it overnight. Then wash off.
l Use Aloe Vera. Take an aloe Vera leaf and peel its outer green cover. Youll see a gel like substance beneath its green outer cover. Take out this gel and apply it on your scars. Leave it for about half an hour and then wash off. Apply the aloe Vera gel twice daily to see the results in just few days. Not only will the acne scars diminish, the skin will also start glowing and will become tighter.
l Apply Olive oil on the acne scars. Take a little olive oil and gently massage your face with this. Focusing more on the pimple scars. Massage for a few minutes till the time you can feel that all the oil has been absorbed by your skin. Now take a clean towel or cloth and drape it into warm water and put the warm wet cloth on to your face to get the steam. Next wipe away the excess oil gently with the cloth, without rubbing and after 1-2 minutes, wash off your face with normal water.
l Use Vitamin E on Acne Scars. You could use vitamin E oil or Vitamin E capsules. First add steam to your face so that the pores open up and then take few drops of vitamin E oil. If you have bought vitamin E capsule, puncture it and extract the oil out of it and apply this oil to your skin having acne scars. Now massage the area with this oil in gentle circular strokes for about 10 minutes or till the oil is absorbed into the skin. Leave for about 15 to 20 minutes and wash it off. You could do this daily.

George Orwells  Burmese  Days in Sinhala
The Burmese Days novel written by British writer George Orwell has been translated into Sinhala by writer, poet and translator Ananda Sellahewa.
Burmese Days was first published in the UK in 1934. It is a tale from the waning days of British colonialism, when Burma was ruled from Delhi as a part of British India.
The novel is based on Orwells experience in Burma. Orwell spent five years from 1922 to 1927 as a police officer in the Indian Imperial Police force in Burma, (now Myanmar). Burma had become part of the British Empire during the 19th century.
Burmese Days is set in 1920s imperial Burma, in the fictional district of Kyauktada. The translator attempts to give true picture of the colonial era to the Sinhala readers. Burma is a country similar to Sri Lanka with rich Buddhist civilization and with majority Buddhist population. Orwell describes how the British colonial exploit resources of Burma while denouncing the local people and how the selfish local people please the British colonials for their personal gain.
Since the situation in contemporary Sri Lanka is similar to the situation in Burma as described by Orwell, this book gives familiar experience to the readers.
The translator Ananda Sellahewa is an Engineer by profession and has been working in the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment. Presently he is working as the Project Director of the Dam Safety and Water Resource Planning Projects.
Sellahewa has translated many important novels for Sinhala readers who are interested in advanced international literature. The Land that Time Forgot  Edgar Rice Boroughs, People that Time Forgot and Out of Time Abyss - Edgar Rice Boroughs, Avenger  Frederick Forsyth, Cobra-Frederick Forsyth, Afghan- Frederick Forsyth, The Icon- Frederick Forsyth, The Deceiver- Frederick Forsyth, Kill List-Frederick Forsyth, Devils Alternative - Frederick Forsyth and Veteran- Frederick Forsyth are some of the other books translated by Sellahewa.

Gibson leaves England to become South Africa coach
London: Ottis Gibson has agreed to step down from his role as England bowling coach and become South Africa's new head coach, the England and Wales Cricket Board announced on Wednesday.
Gibson, who took up his current role in 2015, will leave after England's third and final Test against West Indies next week.
He succeeds Russell Domingo, whose contract with Cricket South Africa expired after South Africa's 3-1 Test series defeat in England earlier this month.
"I would like to place on record my thanks to Ottis Gibson for his services to English cricket," England's director of cricket Andrew Strauss said in a press release.
"Ottis has been an integral part of the England team in his two stints as bowling coach. His experience, tactical awareness and understanding of bowling in all conditions has benefited our approach and has helped our bowling unit develop greatly across all formats of the game.
"He is an ambitious man and when this opportunity presented itself, it was difficult for him to turn down. On behalf of the ECB, I would like to wish him every success in the next chapter of his career."
Gibson, 48, is in his second spell working with England's pacemen after four years as head coach of his native West Indies from 2010-14.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss said: "Ottis has played a vital role in our progress over the past few years.
"His knowledge of the international game and the way he has supported all our bowlers in their development has been immeasurable.
"He will no doubt relish the challenge of becoming a head coach once again and coupled with his strong affinity with South African cricket, he will look to take them forward."
Gibson's first South Africa assignment will be a two-Test home series against Bangladesh beginning on September 28, which is followed by a four-match one-day series and a two-match Twenty20 series.
The ECB said it intends to appoint a new fast bowling coaching ahead of England's busy end-of-year schedule, which includes an Ashes tour of Australia.

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has written to all Parliamentarians educating them on the new Inland Revenue Bill to be presented in Parliament, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that the letter contained all details on the impact of the new Bill. The letter described the adverse impact on doctors and all the other professionals.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the new Bill would abolish all tax reliefs granted from the previous Act and new taxes would be imposed, while increasing the existing taxes to extremely high levels, putting an adverse impact on the professionals. Passing the Bill without a wide social dialogue would create more issues.
All professionals would leave the country and obtain foreign citizenship as a result of the new Act. Strangely, there is no impact whatsoever on foreign professionals who come to Sri Lanka to work, he added.

Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said development activities of the previous regime were limited only to propaganda but the present regime is engaging in genuine development without any political agenda.
The Minister was addressing a meeting following the opening of the Uda Gammana at Bedigamtota in Suriyawewa. He was accompanied by Housing and Constructions Minister Sajith Premadasa. The minister said the present regime inaugurated a period of transition in the country that was conducive to the people while the previous regime did everything possible to fatten the economy of the rulers. Today, the people live in peace and harmony sans fear psychosis. That is what was expected from the present regime, he said. The minister said the present regime took over the country along with three heaps of garbage. Corruption is one heap of garbage which had spread up to the Presidential level. The second is the allegation regarding human rights. The third is the countrys debt, he said.
The minister added that the previous regime shot to death those who sought drinking water and made journalists disappear when they wrote against the regime. Those in the administration had allegations of human rights violations.The present regime under President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe saved the country from such allegations by the international community.
The minister said the previous regime set up a seaport sans ships, an airport sans planes, an international playground sans cricketers and an international convention hall sans conventions to gain a large amount of commissions. The previous regime did not concentrate on the day to day requirements of the less fortunate, down-trodden people, the Minister added.

Hasty changes not healthy for ailing motor industry- CMTA
While welcoming the initiative taken for duty reduction on motor cycles and small trucks Ceylon Motor Traders Association's (CMTA's) view is that sudden changes of that nature is not healthy for the industry, said CMTA Chairman Reeza Rauf.
If you look in depth the reality is that there is no significant difference as highlighted by certain media and there will not be a significant price reduction for motor cycles, the chairman cautioned. Earlier the change the import duty for motor cycles was computed by two methods either FOB based duty and Engine Capacity based duty on unit rate, whichever was higher was applicable. Majority of the brand new motor cycles was computed at the unit rate system therefore the discontinuation of 90% excise duty or the FOB based duty method will not give a substantial benefit, contrary to the expectation of the consumers,
Even in the case of the small truck the reduction of Rs. 300,000 will not help the consumers very much as yet the retail price would be around 1.6 million which is considered yet too high in price, he said. The CMTA wishes to reiterate that the policy makers should not resort to shortsighted sudden changers, rather look at more wide and open minded policies that are beneficial the consumers and as well as the Industry.
The government is always trying to fulfill the needs of the so-called common man and it is very unfortunate that all the co so-called common man is always looking for relief or in other words Sahana. If we are to move ahead of becoming a developed nation this mind set has to change, Rauf pointed out. When exorbitant and unrealistic duty amounts are imposed it is very obvious that the consumer cannot afford it and then the consumer is always looking for this so-called Sahana.
Its high time that policy makers look at matters from a common mans point of view of what he can afford and also at the same time see how to protect the automobile and transport industry in continuing their day to day business activities in a healthy manner, where this play the major role in the development of the country, the chairman added.

Houston flood: Explosions at Arkema chemical plant

Explosions have been heard coming from a chemical plant near the flooded US city of Houston.
Emergency officials reported two blasts and black smoke issuing from the Arkema plant at Crosby.
During heavy rainfall from Hurricane Harvey, the complex lost the ability to refrigerate chemical compounds that need to be kept cool.
There was no way to prevent an explosion, the company had warned earlier.
Ahead of the explosions, one police officer who was helping secure the site was taken to hospital after inhaling fumes, while others admitted themselves to hospital as a precaution.
In a statement, the company said: "At approximately 2am CDT [07:00 GMT], we were notified by the Harris County Emergency Operations Center of two explosions and black smoke coming from the Arkema Inc plant in Crosby, Texas.
"Local officials had previously established an evacuation zone in an area 1.5 miles from our plant, based on their assessment of the situation.
"We want local residents to be aware that product is stored in multiple locations on the site, and a threat of additional explosion remains. Please do not return to the area within the evacuation zone until local emergency response authorities announce it is safe to do so."
At least 33 people have been killed in eastern Texas in the aftermath of the storm, which the US National Weather Service has now downgraded to a tropical depression.

India rupee: Illegal cash crackdown failed - bank report

Indians returned almost all of the high-currency notes banned in last year's shock government crackdown on illegal cash, the central bank says.
It said 15.28tn rupees ($242bn) - or 99% - of the money had made its way back into the banking system.
Ministers had hoped the move would make it difficult for hoarders of undeclared wealth to exchange it for legal tender.
The news that it did not will raise questions about the policy, which brought chaotic scenes across India.
Banks ran out of cash after the ban on 500 ($7) and 1,000 rupee notes, which accounted for about 85% of the money in circulation.
At others, police were called in to manage long queues of anxious customers hoping to change their savings.
Many low-income Indians, traders and ordinary savers who rely on the cash economy were badly hit.
Has demonetisation been a success or a failure As per the RBI data, it's safe to say that demonetisation has been a failure of epic proportions.
The RBI report says that illegal notes worth 15.28tn rupees ($242bn) had been deposited in banks up to 30 June. This basically means that almost 99% of the "demonetised" money was deposited into banks and wasn't really destroyed.
As far as detecting counterfeit currency is concerned, nothing much seems to have happened on this front either.
Over and above this, the government's policy caused a huge cash shortage, with people having to spend many days standing in ATM lines trying to withdraw their own money.
As far as the Modi government is concerned they are unlikely to admit it was a big mistake and will continue to put a positive spin on it, as they have since last November. Things will not change on that front.
Politicians, analysts and ordinary Indians have argued for months over whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi's so-called demonetisation gamble was a success or failure.
Now the data finally provides the answer, on page 195 of theReserve Bank of India (RBI) annual report.
Agriculture, the rural economy and property - which rely largely on cash transactions - were sectors hit by the ban.
It also contributed to a slowdown in economic growth.
But some analysts did point out the policy did have some positive aspects, including injecting cash into the banking system which had brought the cost of loans down.
Few observers think the bank figures will damage the government, which has fended off criticism of its cash crackdown while making electoral gains, including a sweeping victory in crucial Uttar Pradesh state in March.

Instructions for expiditious passage to National Audit BILL
President Maithripala Sirisena said he had instructed relevant authorities to expedite the National Audit Bill and ensure its passage in Parliament.
I have spoken about the National Audit Bill in Parliament as well. Our plan was to pass the legislation in Parliament, in January, this year.This is August and work is still in progress. I am sad about the current situation and I strictly instructed relevant authorities to finalise everything as soon as possible, the President said.
I have raised this matter before the Cabinet too. Although the Audit Commission has been set up, it cannot function without the new Act, the President said, adding that it would not hesitate to walk an extra mile to ensure financial transparency of the government.
Sometimes it takes time. For instance, a school principal was sentenced on Tuesday for accepting a bribe of Rs. 25,000. The sentence came nearly nine years after filing the case. I know people expect quick results and are very concerned about some large scale cases of corruption under the previous administration. But, the process is not so easy, he added.
These acts of corruption have been committed in a meticulous manner. Although everyone is aware of them, we have to find evidence to prove them before judiciary.
Former Brazilian leader Lula de Silva faced his lawsuit for nine and a half years. Even the cases against Ferdinand Marcos took a long time. But, there are also instances where cases of corruption have been expedited to deliver fast results.Take, for instance, the verdict against Nawaz Shariff which finally led to his resignation.
Therefore, I have instructed our authorities to take necessary measures to expedite these important cases. We have also shared views with legal experts as well. Sometimes, we, as a government, cannot directly get involved in such matters.We can only set the background and provide infrastructure, the President said, during his meeting with media heads and newspaper editors.

During the initial stages of the awards scheme, the main criterion for the determination of award winners was export performance in absolute terms related to volume and value and the growth in exports achieved during the preceding three years encompassing various products and services.
The other areas that were assessed were related to efforts at product and market development, financial management of the enterprise, quality of products and services, impact on the environment, improvements in productivity leading to efficient management of the enterprise and special certifications including the ISO range of certifications acquired by an enterprise over the years.
However, the evaluation criteria related to the event have evolved over the years to accommodate contemporary requirements to compete in the international market place and also to conform with the economic and export policies of the government.
In the modern context, these include innovation and differentiation of products, branding, and value addition to integrate with international value chains to be competitive and for long term sustainability.
This year, the selection process of award winners will be facilitated by the well-known multinational audit firm - Ernst & Young, to enhance credibility and transparency.
Future award winners will be announced at the event and not before as in previous years.

Kataragama Devalaya Kapuralas demand action against Basnayake Nilame
A group of Kapuralas (officiating priests) attached to the Ruhunu Maha Kataragama Devalapaya, have sent a petition to the IGP, Buddhist Affairs Commissioner and several other parties, requesting them to initiate an investigation against the incumbent Basnayake Nilame of the Devalaya who, they allege, is engaged in severe misappropriation of Devalaya funds.
Chief officiating priest Somipala T. Ratnayake addressing the media alleged that when devotees are supplying all provisions for the Devadana and other poojas, including rice and vegetable, the Basnayake Nilake is charging Rs. 12,500 from devotees ostensibly for the deva danaya and pocketing the money.
He said all expenditure of the Devalaya, including water and electricity bills are borne by the State. He said the Basnayake Nilame had obtained a Bank loan to build a Vishrama sala (Rest hall) when the building was put up by the Army with material supplied by the devotees.
Lal Rajapaksa, a priest officiating in thevava ceremonies alleged that the present Basnayake Nilame is the most corrupt Basnayake Nilame among the long line of persons who held the post.
He said the Basnayake Nilame had collected money from sponsors to erect silver pillars at the Devalaya saying a pillar cost Rs. 1.7 million each, but erected silver plated pillars instead and played out the balance money. He said a large section of funds collected for the Perahera too had gone missing.
However, Basnayake Nilame D. P. Kurunegala when contracted dismissed the allegations as baseless. He said all income and expenditure had been accounted and documented in a transparent manner. He said he is prepared for any audit inspection.

Kia is No 1 automobile brand for quality in USA ranking
Kia has topped a USA ranking of global automobile brands assessed for quality, outperforming a prestigious list that includes luxury marques from some of top names in the industry.
This is the second successive year that the J. D. Power Initial Quality Study (IQS) has ranked Kia No. 1 on its prestigious ranking.
The US marketing research company compiles the IQS ranking by evaluating the quality of vehicles during the first 90 days of ownership, covering problems related to driving experience, engine and transmission. Overall performance is assessed by the number of problems experienced per 100 vehicles, where a lower score reflects higher quality.
Releasing the results of the 2017 IQS, J. D. Power said: Kia has shown the best performance of any brand in the 20 years of the study and received five segment awards  the most wins by any nameplate in this years study. Kias 2017 score of 72 was five points better than that of the second ranked automobile brand and 11 points better than its own score of last year. This years score was derived from the scores accorded to Kia vehicles in five segments  the Soul (Compact Multi-Purpose Vehicle), Forte (Compact Car), Cadenza (Large Car), Niro (Small SUV) and Sorento (Midsize SUV), all of which topped their respective categories, with the Cadenza achieving the lowest average number of problems among all models ranked in the study.
The 2017 IQS analysed responses from 77,415 respondents with regards to 243 vehicle models across 26 segments. Vehicles were evaluated on a broad range of quality problem symptoms reported by vehicle owners. The top 32 automobile models in the ranking headed by Kia includes brands such as Mercedes Benz, BMW, Jaguar, Audi, Cadillac, Land Rover, Volvo, Jeep, Chrysler and Porsche.

## Title: Live  organic!

Live  organic!
It is present in your vegetables, it is there in your spices, your tea, and even in your beverages. It is in your jam, dhal, millet-bread, and curries and it is in your clothes as well. But more than ever it is on your mind. It is a word called organic that is becoming a whole new way of life  of benefitting from going back to your roots.
Sri Lanka is seeing a quick sprouting of organic products. These are sold not only in large shopping hubs, but also in smaller localities and neighbourhoods. Once found only in health food stores, organic food is now a regular feature at most supermarkets. A lot of people seem to be catching on to the organic mantra each day, as word spreads, and demand increases. There is a store at an arms reach for most people in the city today.
Noting this fondness for a green lifestyle Udara Ratnayake has come up with a unique concept. She has introduced the Sri Lankan organic enthusiasts to a special tea made exclusively from Gotu Kola (Centellaasiatica). What is new about Udaras product is that it is actually the Gotu Kola leaves which will be used to be brewed to make tea rather than the power. Herbal Gotu Kola rather than the common Gotu Kola grown in gardens is used for the product.
What triggered Udaras concept is her mother, Nilani Champikas love for gardening.
Herable Gotu kola tea
She grew flowers in the front garden while the back portion of land was reserved for the kitchen garden. We hardly bought vegetables from the market since everything was home grown. I was brought up in an environment which promotes organic eating. This motivated me to start Green Care since I noticed that there is a demand for a healthy lifestyle in the nation, Udara explained.
Green Care was initiated as an environmentally conscious start up with a strong aim to support and promote organic agriculture. Gotu Kola tea was the first product to be introduced under the brand.
I believe in healthy alternatives to contemporary fast food. I met Achala Samaradiwakara of the Good Market and she told me that a many people sell organic fruits, vegetables and green leaves. A new product will catch the eyes of the visitors. Herbal teas have a lot of demand from the public. So my answer was to introduce Gotu Kola herbal tea to meet the growing demand for healthy lifestyles in the nation, she said.
She notes that herbal Gotu Kola is more difficult to grow than the normal kind. She had engaged in a market research going through all the herbal tea ranges available at the market. Since Gotu Kola herbal tea was absent from the list she had worked towards developing the product.
Often dubbed as the wonder herb Gotu Kola is a healing plant with a power to combat a number of illnesses, increase memory power, rejuvenate skin health and offers a truly restful sleep. Commonly known as Indian Pennywort, Gotu Kola is said to be a herb frequently consumed by Yogis in India to improve their concentration power. Gotu Kola not only fortifies the immunity system, but it also acts as a natural purifier of blood. It also helps to reduce skin disorders. It has the power to boost the central nervous system which further helps conditions such as epilepsy, senility and premature ageing.
Gotu kola brewed to make tea
Gotu Kola is a natural memory amplifier as well. It helps to relieve stress and depression. It also aids to combat chronic illnesses like high blood pressure, and help the body to defend against toxins. According to research Gotu Kola is used for treating rheumatism, congestive heart failure, urinary tract infections and hepatitis too. This miracle herb is also ideal for speedy recovery from wounds.
Since the idea came about from her mothers hobby, Green Care goes under the tag line From her Garden. Though her main product is Gotu Kola herbal tea, Udara has also introduced moringa and curry leaf herbal tea.
These types of drinks do not necessarily have to be made from tea leaves. You can brew a tea from other plants as well. These beverages are similar to green tea since they have a lot of health benefits, Udara said adding that the daily consumption of moringa and curry leaves is good for a persons wellbeing.
You get a lot of nutrition from them. Moringa is a good fighting agent against diabetes. Curry leaves help to lower cholesterol levels. They also fight against cancer and possess anti-diabetic and antioxidant properties, she mused.
An old girl of Girls High School, Kandy, Udara comes from a family which is engaged in business. Her father is Deepal Ratnayake. Her sister, Dilhara, is a lecturer at a private university. Udara followed arts for her G C E Advanced Levels. She holds a business management degree and is employed as a marketer for a leading manufacturing company in the island.
Bringing back the age old farming concepts to lifethrough innovation, Green Care ardently practices organic farming in their plantations located in Galkulama, Puttalam. The plantations are verified under Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) and provide the base ingredients for Green Care organic.
Hand made coconut oil
Becoming an entrepreneur is my goal. Green Care Organic is a step towards this venture. However I want to give something back to the society as well. This is why I have employed 10 women to engage in producing the products. They face various hardships. so a job which they can engage in leisurely is a great relief to them. I consider them as my partners in this journey rather than workers. We meet up during weekends and during my holidays, she said.
Speaking about the challenges she met in developing the products Udara notes that they were mostly related to transportation, packaging and allocating the relevant market for the products. Going strong for six months the response has been tremendous since the products sell like hot cakes.
Part of the proceeds from Green Care is reinvested for CSR initiatives which Udara personally oversees conducting workshops on organic farming in rural areas.
These workshops are mainly implemented in farming communities enabling the rural farmers to build their capacity to meet the rising demand for organic food, locally and internationally. The newest product that Udara has added to her brand is handmade coconut oil. She is working on developing a product using asparagus.

LTTE conflict an example for radical extremism: Canadian delegate
The LTTE conflict was an example for radical extremism, which prevailed for more than 30 years, having been influenced by the history of conflicts elsewhere, Borealis Threat and Risk Consulting Ltd, Canada, President and CEO Phil Gurski said.
He was speaking at the Colombo Defence Seminar at the BMICH on the sub topic Definitions and Root Causes under Violent Extremism.
Gurski said individual radicalisation seems to have developed into an ideology to become a conflict.
Violent radicalisation could also develop due to mental illness, egoism, radical extremisms and ideologies, he said.
There is no logical formula to identify violent extremists. It depends on social status, communities, religion and sometimes, due to individual processes which in turn would develop to be a radical violent extremism that could cause a conflict, he said.
Adoption of bad programmes, unnecessary agendas may also cause a conflict. Why people become violent Poverty, lack of education, lack of money, mental illness and ideology mainly drive them to extreme conflicts, he said.

Mantle falls on Malinga to revive teams fortunes
Dilshan Munaweera recalled as replacement for Chandimal:
T20 World Cup winning captain Lasith Malinga has been given the task of ending Sri Lankas losing streak against India when he leads them in the fourth ODI at the R Premadasa Stadium today.
Malinga takes over the leadership of the team following the injury to stand-in captain Chamara Kapugedera who led in the third ODI at Pallekele which Sri Lanka lost to give India a winning 3-0 lead in the five-match series.
Malinga becomes the fifth player to captain the team during the Indian tour following injuries and suspensions that have left Sri Lanka changing captains like playing musical chairs.
Rangana Herath captained Sri Lanka in the first Test and gave way to the appointed captain Dinesh Chandimal for the next two. Upul Tharanga the appointed one-day skipper led in the first two matches of the ongoing series before a slow over rate saw him suspended for two matches. In Tharangas absence the captaincy passed onto Chamara Kapugedera for the third ODI. But after playing in that match Kapugedera has been ruled out of todays game by back stiffness and the mantle has now fallen again on Malinga to resuscitate a struggling team and get them back into winning ways.
The iconic fast bowler will lead his country only for todays match as Tharanga will be available again to captain in the fifth ODI on September 3 having served out his ban.
In 2014, I got the opportunity to captain the national team. At that time Sanath Jayasuriya was chairman of selectors. Now Sanath is there again. Whoever has power believed that I can do something thats why they wanted to give that opportunity to me for the next match, said Malinga at the pre-match press conference yesterday.
I want to do my best for my team and for the youngsters. We want to win the two remaining matches. Thats why I want to use my experience and give all the confidence to the young players. I feel its a good challenge for me. At the moment, we have lost a few matches, yes. I have played for the last 14 years for the national team, and I still feel we have good young players and a few experienced players also.
This is the time we have to stand up and give confidence to the young players  that we are still good enough to play international cricket. Im also really enjoying this challenge with a young team. People think we are not on top of the table, but I feel we can change that, he said.
Malinga pointed out that the recent loss suffered by the team was partly due to the lack of experienced players in the side.
The past Sri Lankan team had experienced players. We can see every other country that is playing national cricket worldwide has a high number of experienced players in their eleven. At the moment we havent got that luxury. But weve have a few talented young players in the team. Thats why we want to back them and give our experience to them. Then I feel they will perform better for us over the next few years, said Malinga.
Theres no shortage of talent and skill in our team, but there is a shortcoming in how we execute that. We need to fix our mentality. My main goal is to try and instill a mentality whereby players are able to deal with tough situations and persevere. If that is successful, we will be able to get a good result tomorrow, he said.
The 34-year-old fast bowler who is one wicket away from capturing 300 ODI wickets accepted the fact that he has lost some of his pace and was now looking to add new dimensions to his bowling to keep him going for a few more years.
Ive played international and franchise cricket for the last 14 years. Ive played every other country and every single player in national cricket. Now Im 34. My pace is cut down. If you asked me 10 years ago, I didnt expect this. But whoever is coming towards the end of their careers, there is failure. People talk about them not being fit enough, or not picking him, said Malinga.
I played with Zak (Zaheer Khan) in the IPL close to 3-5 years. He is a legend of the Indian bowling attack in previous years. We always talk with so many bowlers around the world. When I meet them I want to get their experience also because they are in the commentary box, they look at every single one of my body movements and my bowling action, and how I swing the ball.
They have a good idea of how Im going now. Every time I have an opportunity, we speak about my bowling action, and how I have to improve. Zak is more of a seam and swing bowler, and I want to learn more of that kind of thing over the next few years, he said.
Malinga who restricted himself to playing only T20 cricket because of a recurring knee injury returned to fifty-over cricket during the Champions Trophy in June and said that he was feeling better and had no qualms bowling ten overs in the fifty-over contest.
I didnt play for 19 months because of my injury. Ive only played a couple of series since then. Now I feel I am getting better. Everyone knows how major my leg injuries are. Now that my leg is getting better, Im doing all the treatment and all the rehabilitation and the fitness also. I feel really comfortable to bowl 10 overs consistently and looking forward to the next ball, said Malinga who hopes to play till the 2023 World Cup.
Sri Lanka has added Dilshan Munaweera to their squad as replacement for Dinesh Chandimal. Were not sure about Danushka Gunathilakas (shoulder) injury at the moment. Well have a look at the pitch and decide what kind of team to field, said Malinga.

International Literacy Day falls on September 8:
Several programmes will be implemented to mark the International Literacy Day on September 8 to increase the local literacy rate, Education Minister Akila Viraj
Kariyawasam said.
According to the Child Activity Survey conducted by the Census and Statistics Department, the number of children who had not attended school from January to May 2016 amounted to 452,661.
This does not mean that all of these students have stopped schooling.The majority of 236,819 out of 452,661 students were awaiting the G.C.E O/L results and most of them started schooling once the results were released, Kariyawasam said.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo, he further said that there were around 77,730 students who were not interested in formal education. But, they may enter to other streams like vocational training or the labour force. However, the Education Ministry has set up supervisory committees with the help of Grama Niladhari officers, Police officers, Midwives and Development officers with the aim of sending these students back to schools.
He further said around 4,154 children are not attending the schools due to financial problems. We expect to provide them special allowances under the foster parents scheme in the future. This will be included to the budget 2018 as a proposal after discussing with the Finance Minister.
From 2018 onwards, even students who fail the GCE O/L examination will be given an opportunity to sit the GCE A/L, he added. This will be implemented as a pilot project and students who have faced the O/L examination this year will give a chance to select three subjects out of 26 subjects. Students can select a subject of their preference out of the ones available in their schools. The idea here is to believe and highlight the childs hidden talents.The important thing to understand in these circumstances is that some of children inborn talents cannot be measured through GCE (O/L) or (A/L) examinations.
So, they will now have a chance to select their prefer subjects on their skills and talents.
Another milestone is introduction of the health insurance scheme covering all students in government schools, non-aided or aided private schools, Pirivena schools and international schools. The health scheme for students was a 2017 Budget proposal and the government had allocated Rs 2.7 billion for this purpose.

Narrowing gender gap
According to the World Economic Forums Global Gender Gap Report 2016, Sri Lanka is ranked in the 100th place out of 144 countries. The study used four major criteria to establish each countrys status in terms of gender equality in economy, education, health, and political representation.
Sri Lankas gender gap and gender equality rank declined from 79 in 2014 to an 84 in 2015 and the downward trend continued in 2016. We have been slipping from our privileged position in the top 20 since 2010.
Sri Lanka presents a mixed scenario, with positive achievements in education and health indicators, as well as negative developments such as gender inequality in employment and political participation, and issues of gender-based violence. This article will study briefly womens declining labour participation, under-representation in politics, sand prevalent gender-based violence. These are the recognised challenges we are faced with. These are the challenges we have to find solutions.
Education
The female labour force participation rate in Sri Lanka is low and has not changed much over time. According to a World Bank report, the ratio of female to male workforce participation is 40.2 %. This means, for every 100 male workers, there are only 40 females. Sri Lanka is a lower middle-income country, and therefore, ideally, we should have an average of 63 per cent.
The Department of Census and Statistics 2015 Labour Force Survey data, of the working age population, says only 36% of female population are engaged in the labour market, compared to 75% of male population. However, the ratio of females engaged in the labour market steadily increases with the higher levels of education. In other words. the gap between male-female participation in the labour force comes down at educational levels beyond secondary education. The statistics reveal that this gap is lowest for the females with a degree level or professional qualification.
Therefore, it is obvious that education influencing factor for female workforce participation.
It may be due to number of reasons. Women with higher levels of education delay marriage and childbearing. Since, higher education increases their earning potential, they can obtain the services of a housemaid to look after children and continue with their employment even after marriage. And, because of the considerable income they will feel comfortable to work than stay at home.
Another survey has revealed that the lower fertility of qualified females enables them to increase their participation in the labour market.
Social norms
However, higher education alone will not get more females into the workforce. The market itself also needs to create job opportunities that are conducive to more educated female workers. Unfortunately, the Sri Lankan labour market for females, is skewed towards lower end of the skill spectrum.
There is a serious lack of opportunities in the types of occupations preferred by females with higher skills. This is a serious deterrent for females to enter the labour market.
Our social norms also compliment the lower female workforce participation. Australias former Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Elizabeth Broderick, who was in Colombo recently explained it.
Although Sri Lanka is a progressive nation for women, there are still some limitations. There is a strong belief that to be a good mother, daughter of wife is very much about womens role in the family and house caring. There are strong social norms, which make it difficult for women to both work and care.
Political empowerment
In terms of political participation, although women have had the right to exercise their vote and to participate in political activities, the representation of women in Parliament has never exceeded 6% and has been even lower in elected local assemblies.
Female political empowerment is measured using three variables  the ratio of females to males in parliament and other legislative bodies, the ratio of females to males at the ministerial level, and the ratio of the number of years with a female head of state to the years with a male head of state (in the last 50 years).
Although, these values are important to track gender equality progress, they do not truly reflect political empowerment. Political empowerment defined by such narrow criterion does not adequately capture womens political advancements. It should also include womens political participation in electing leaders. Womens voting participation rate is also an important criterion of womens political empowerment. High womens voter turnout is an important expression of political participation.
Additionally, measure of political empowerment should include womens participation in interest groups and grass root activities. It is important to measure and value this criterion because it represents an important channel of change in the policy and political environments.
If such a broader set of criteria is used to measure womens political participation, it is likely that the figures would show increased political empowerment of Sri Lankan women over time.
Nonetheless, having women in official political positions, determining local and national policies, is rather important because a large share of policies that directly affect women are shaped and enforced through local and provincial assemblies.
LG elections
Therefore, it is essential that we look at policies that aim to improve womens political participation to move towards more equitable governing structures.
One such policy is reserving positions for women in local governing bodies. The Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill which was passed in Parliament recently, has allocated 25% of representation to women in Provincial Councils and Local Government Institutions. The Government authorities indicated that after experimenting the new system at LG Elections, it would be extended to Provincial Councils and National level elections.
Our neighbour, India, has experimented on this scheme some time ago. Although the policy did not show remarkable results at first, the women leaders gradually learned the importance of political participation. The men in the electorates, who previously could not imagine females becoming part of decision making, began to change their thinking.
The high cost of facing an election is also a major reason discouraging women from contesting. Introducing laws to control campaign funding would undoubtedly contribute to encourage womens participation in elections.
GRB
Another effective instrument which could be used to bridge these representation gaps, is Gender Responsive Budgeting (GRB). Gender-responsive budgeting is already implemented in more than 50 countries over the world. The rationale behind GRB is to integrate critical gender concerns into fiscal policies and administration to address disparities.
India adapted it 2005 and every annual budget ever since has included a statement that lists out two parts. There is Part A, which reflects Women Specific Schemes, namely, those which have 100 per cent allocation for women, and Part B, which reflects Pro Women Schemes, namely, where at least 30 per cent of the allocation is for women.
Over the years, India has stood out for its implementation of gender budgeting, and with the Ministry of Finance playing the central role, it has managed to successfully institutionalise the concept at both the national and State levels. Studies substantiate the positive link between GRB and improved indicators for women. For instance, a recent International Monetary Fund study found that States that employ GRB has a positive impact on infrastructure spending.

New breakthroughs in local drone technology
Students from the Drone Development Programme at the University of Moratuwa on Monday, announced the development of locally designed drones or UAVs, (unmanned aerial vehicles).
Locally designed drones have been used to help map terrain after the landslides in Aranayake and flooding in Baddegama earlier this year.
Speaking at the first drone symposium in Sri Lankan at SLIDA, Moratuwa University Professor Rohan Munasinghe called the advent of drone technology disruptive, and said that contrary to popular belief, it is already in the country.
We as the scientific and engineering community of the country have to welcome the technology, and use it to make our lives easier, to make the things that we do on a daily basis, in technical fields and in engineering fields more efficient, more accurate, Munasinghe said.
Using a slideshow presentation, Munasinghe went through a brief history of Sri Lankan drone technology, proclaiming that though it had come a long way, it could go further. Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka who was the Chief Guest said developments in drone technology represent encouraging efforts by the engineering and technology community of the country to join the bandwagon of high-tech innovation, which the government believes is the way forward toward achieving economic development goals.
When the Meethotamulla disaster occurred, Dr. Manju Gunawardana used the same technology to map out the Meethotamulla Garbage dump. If we could have done this earlier, we would have been able to save many lives," the minister said.

Delivering the keynote speech, Charge D Affairs Khadheeja Najeeha said, The close bond of friendship that the Maldivian people and the people of Sri Lanka share are unmatched.
There are no two countries which are socially, culturally and economically closer to the Maldives than Sri Lanka. These close ties have been further strengthened over the years by closer trade relations between the two countries.
"Maldivians have from time immemorial relied heavily on purchase of various products from Sri Lanka, and in return Sri Lankans have been fond of fish products from the Maldives.
"Today, this traditional merchant-to-merchant trade has been intensified over the decades in the form of supplying shipments in bulk and through various other services.
Moreover, trade relations have been further strengthened by the significant increase of Sri Lankan investments in the Maldives and Maldivian business ventures in Sri Lanka.

However, most school heads had not responded to the request positively, W. M. Balasooriya, senior Director of Education, Kurunegala told the Daily News.
School heads have to take responsibility if school candidates face obstacles at examination centres, he said. About 126 school candidates faced such problems over the issue at the G.C.E. Advanced Level Examination 2017 in August this year, Balasooriya added.

Old Thomians continue winning streak
34th Annual 'Battle of The Blues  UK:
The 34th Annual Royal-Thomian Cricket Encounter - UK, held on August 6, once again provided a day of an enthralling and nail-biting game for the old boys and their families who live in the United Kingdom. The iconic Walker Cricket Ground in London, which boasts of a 162 year history, was the venue for this event for the third consecutive year.
This year's encounter was a star-studded affair as the two teams included six former college captains, 15 former 1st XI players and nine cricketers who had gone on to play first class cricket. The Thomians were determined to defend the coveted Amerasekara Shield for the sixth consecutive year when they beat Royalists by 26 runs.
Reluctant to change the winning formula, the Thomian skipper decided to bat first after winning the toss. The Thomian innings purred into motion as the dashing opener Sacha Seneviratne thwacked a towering six over deep mid wicket.
It didnt take too long for the Royal seamers to mute the scoring through impeccable line and length. The early departure of Dilshan Manamperi brought Lloyd Paternott, the star from the previous encounter, to the crease. Lloyd announced his arrival with a brace of boundaries and looked to be in good nick. Chamika Karunaratne, a former Royal and SL U19 captain, was introduced into the attack and immediately started causing trouble with some pace and bounce. In his second over, Lloyd latched onto a nugget of width on the off side just to be caught brilliantly by Devind Padmanathan at backward point. Pathmanathan joined Karunaratne to claim another couple of scalps in no time sending the Thomians into a nosedive. Leaving the usual flamboyance aside, Skipper Mendis played a subdued knock and tried to revive the innings by forging a partnership with Madhushan Ravichandrakumar, the 2014 Thomian skipper. After the departure of this pair, the dashing all-rounder, Shashrika Pussegolla joined Nirrushan Raveenthiraraja to take over the responsibility of steadying the ship. The former Thomian captain Nirrushan, who is remembered for one of the best fight-backs in the Royal Thomian history, once again displayed his indomitable grit against a testing spell of bowling.
The spin sensation, Pathmanathan managed to break this partnership by taking the prize wicket of Pussegolla hampering the chances of the Thomians reaching 200. The speedsters were brought back into the attack by the Royal captain with the intention of knocking the tail off. Nirrushan soon departed lobbying a catch to the keeper off the bowling of Karunaratne and the lower order failed to add many runs before being bundled up for 153. Given the quality of the Royal batting, a Thomian victory seemed a far cry. The veterans, Navin Samarakoon and Malinda Thotiwilage opened the batting for Royal. Samarakoon in particular was in sublime form dispatching the ball to all corners of the field in the early overs.
An immediate change to the length by Sacha Seneviratne following a tactical mid-field chat with the skipper, managed to bring the much needed breakthrough for the Thomians. The departure of Samarakoon brought the all rounder Hashen Ramanayake, the elder son of the former Sri Lanka paceman Champaka Ramanayake, to the crease.
Thilaksha Sumanasiri was soon introduced into the attack to peg back the scoring rate and he rose to the occasion by bowling 4 tight overs just for 7 runs with utmost control. The former Big Match winning captain Vidhyesh Balasubramaniam, rolled back the years with an exhibition of leg spin from the other end. This spin wizardry left Royal reeling at 31 for 3 after 10 overs when Dhanushka Perera, the 2001
Royal College captain and big match centurion joined Hashen in the middle.
Perera started to use his feet nimbly against the spinners and was dispatching them at ease to all parts of the Walker ground taking the game away from the Thomians.
The Thomian skipper introduced himself into the attack and immediately produced the breakthrough. Perera departed for a well made 32, spooning a return catch to Shami Mendis. Another former Royal skipper, Pathmanathan joined Ramanayake and started hurtling towards the target. The Thomian skipper turned to the off spin prodigy, Pussegolla expecting a miracle turnaround. Thereon, it was a masterful display of off-spin conceding only 17 runs off the next 6 overs of his spell. Under the astute leadership of Mendis, the Thomians attacked relentlessly in the field with swallow dives and slides that ensured even rare loose balls were punished minimally. However, Ramanayake was outstanding in the face of wickets falling around him. Uncowed by the pressure, he continued to hold the fort for the Royalists as he has done over the years.
The Royalists entered the last 10 overs needing 45 runs with only 3 wickets in hand. Pussegolla and Ravichandrakumar managed to squeeze in another 5 overs just for 15 runs ratcheting up the pressure on the lower order. In a desperate quest to keep up with the run rate, Pasindu Chamikara tried to clobber a full length delivery from Pussegolla down the ground only to find the hands of Sumanasiri at long on. In the 36th over, a direct hit from Ravichandrakumar found a languid Rangana Rajapaksha when scampering for a single marking the 6th consecutive victory for the Thomians. Pussegolla was named man of the match for his match winning spell with 4 wickets.
Dan Whiting, the General Manager of the Walker Cricket Ground and a renowned cricket writer, said "It was a pleasure for the Walker Cricket Ground to host such a prestigious and long standing fixture. The quality of the cricket was excellent, especially some of the fielding and as a ground that has hosted players in the past such as WG Grace, Ricky Ponting and Graeme Smith, it was a pleasure to see such fine cricket".
Chief scores -
Old Thomians UK 153 (Paternott 24, Karunaratne 5/15)
Old Royalists UK 127 (Ramanayake 39*,Pussegolla 4/34)

Parents given administration of Sri Lankan school in Doha
The administration of the Sri Lanka (Stafford) School in Doha Qatar will be handed over to a committee constituted from parents of the students which will also be asked to attend to the shortcomings at the institution.
All this work will be supervised through the Sri Lanka Embassy in Qatar.
The arrangement had received the approval of the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry, said Sri Lanka Ambassador in Qatar A.S.P. Liyanage.
This followed a special discussion held with Foreign Affairs State Minister Vasantha Senanayake at the ministry to iron out the administrative and formal problems which had cropped up at the Sri Lanka school in Doha Qatar on August 29. Liyanage said he pointed out at this discussion that the Sri Lanka school had been functioning for the last 16 years maintained by a group of Sri Lankans there who had not reported anything about the school to the Sri Lankan Embassy, although Sri Lankan schools maintained in foreign countries should come under the purview of the relevant Sri Lankan Embassy.
A group of concerned parents had complained that no infrastructure development had taken place at the school for the past 16 years although a sum of nearly 9 million Qatar Riyals (Rs. 400 million) had accrued to the school fund.

You want to know the truth about this story Ive never told this before. Im going to say it now, quoted Twain.
I remember I had a girl friend visiting me and it was near Christmas and we were baking cookies. I was writing this album and there was a scandal of (Pitt) and Gwyneth (Paltrow) where there was naked photos of him (in Playgirl magazine). 
And this was like all the rage. I just thought I dont know what all the fuss is about. Im like, well that dont impress me much, I mean what is all the fuss. We see people naked every day. Thats really what I thought.
I wasnt picking on Brad Pitt. But that was just the association in that moment and things we make fusses about and whatever. Of course, it could have been any gorgeous guy, she added.

Presidents only wish a pure, unblemished transparent govt. : Isuru Devapriya
President Maithripala Sirisena has never instructed anyone to remove or cut the photographs of the former President, but the former President has instructed to do so after he became the President, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Western Provincial Council Auditorium yesterday, he said that the former President came for the 64th Anniversary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), sat on a chair allocated for the Adviser and had a friendly chat with President Sirisena. The Party leadership was given to President Sirisena with the presence of some of the SLFP high rankers.
According to the Chief Minister, it was the SLFP which always saved the country whenever the UNP destroyed the country in the past. The people of Sri Lanka wanted a SLFP Government led by late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike even before the UNP was formed.
There are documents to prove this fact. It was the SLFP which opened all factories in Sri Lanka, but today, it seems there are non of them existing.
The main target of the 66th Anniversary celebrations of the SLFP was to present policies that could win the younger generation. Present day youths could not be fooled by promising them bracelets or chocolates.
Speaking of corruption, malpractices, robberies and white vans could only change the leadership, but President Sirisena wants to establish a pure, unblemished and transparent Government, he added.

Rajagiriya flyover project:
Road Development Authority (RDA) Chairman Nihal Suriarachchi said that there is no technical or engineering fault with the Rajagiriya flyover project.
Addressing the media, he said work on the project is being carried out as planned in accordance with the design under the observation of the RDA.
There is no fault relating to engineering, technological or construction aspects. The bridge will remain stable for 100 years, he said while rejecting allegations that the Rajagiriya flyover was substandard.
According to him, the flyover is 363m in length. It will accommodate four traffic lanes. The Rajagiriya flyover is suitable for heavy vehicles also. Work on the project is nearing completion, he said.
Chairman Suriarachchi projected that the project could be commissioned by the year end; prior to the scheduled time frame.
He said two other flyover projects are being carried out by the same constructor at Polgahawela and Ganemulla Railway stations over the trailway track.
Work on the Rajagiriya flyover has been expedited to lessen traffic congestion at Rajagiriya junction along Sri Jayewardenapura Mawatha.
The flyover project was initiated by the Road Development Authority of the Higher Education and Highways Ministry in 2016 due to traffic congestion, which has long been a point of contention among the commuters.
The project is funded by the Government of Spain.

Report to PM this week
Internal restructuring of SriLankan:
The Public Enterprise Development Ministry is expected to submit a report on the internal restructuring of SriLankan Airlines to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe by the end of this week.
Minister of Public Enterprise Development, Kabir Hashim speaking to Daily News said they would submit the report on September 1 or 2. As the Airline continues to face stormy weather, many of the potential investors seeking to partner with the government on a public-private partnership have abandoned ship in the last two years.
The Minister however believed that the internal restructuring would help reduce the current losses and keep the National Carrier going until they find a suitable partner in the next one or two years.
But we will work on the assumption that the restructuring has to take place and needs to be done by ourselves because we cannot let it bleed more and more, Hashim said.
Right now the Ministry has got a team together and got the SriLankan management team to work together with the ministry and we are coming up with a restructuring plan, he added.
In June of this year, the Sri Lankans Directors and Chief Executive were summoned before Cabinet to answer for the lack of success in the Airline and grilled for not implementing the Weliamuna report which found incriminating evidence of corruption and malpractice by the previous regime.
President Maithripala Sirisena at the time had promised to take decisive action on the SriLankans Board. Whilst many had asked that the President sack the whole Board, the Prime Minister had promised that the management team would be restructured within weeks.
As recommendations on the internal restructuring are to be made soon, Minister Hashim noted that if the need arose, the hard decisions have to be taken.
When TPG (US private equity firm) did a full due diligence and they were well aware of the fact that the debt factor would be taken out, conditionally of course, but they also cited many other reasons. Also at present it is not an easy time for the airline industry globally. Then we have the lease agreements signed by the previous government and they have signed the most disadvantageous; some of them cant be cancelled. So when they see that they run a mile. MR is responsible for Sri Lankans problems.
And then they went and employed 4,000 odd people from 2008-2014,and that is a colossal number of people to take on. So anybody who wants to take it up looks at it as a political issue,he explained.
However,as a potential restructuring of management spells success or failure for the Airline, the Minister believed that, If we turn around the balance sheet and PNL and do some reallocation of staff to different units and present a better picture, we can make it a success.

Reviewing policing practices
Transforming Police into a dynamic Service - Part 1:
Though the practice of policing has existed in various forms throughout the history of Sri Lanka, it was the Dutch who first tasked their military with the responsibility of policing the City of Colombo. Later, in 1659, the Colombo Municipal Council adopted a resolution to appoint paid guards to protect the city by night. Thus, Sri Lanka Police have completed 150 years of service, as of 2016.
Keeping with the policies of Good Governance, the Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development, Minister Sagala Ratnayaka advised his officials to conduct a comprehensive research to find ways and means of introducing reforms for the Sri Lanka Police.
In the changing contemporary social landscape, especially in a post-war context, the Ministry of Law and Order and Southern Development (MLOSD) took steps to review current practices in policing in Sri Lanka with the aim of transforming the Sri Lanka Police force into a dynamic police service, in keeping with the principles of good governance, accountability and transparency.
In this context, the Ministry appointed a Policing Reforms Committee (PRC) in July 2016 to deliberate, and propose measures for introducing substantial reforms in policing in Sri Lanka. The PRC is chaired by the Secretary to the Ministry of Law and Order and Southern Development, and includes representatives from the Sri Lanka Police, the National Police Commission, academia and civil society. The Policing Reforms Committee has handed over the Sri Lanka Policing Reforms Action Plan to Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka, Minister of .
The objective of these reforms is to ensure that the resources available to the Sri Lanka Police are used in a manner that achieves the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness in its operations, as measured by reference to the best policing standards of comparable police services around the world.
Research commissioned by the PRC
As part of the process of this project, three pieces of research were commissioned by the PRC to assist with their deliberations. This included an organizational analysis of the Sri Lanka Police by an expert committee, a survey among 1,200 police personnel at all ranks, and a community consultation among approximately 1,200 individuals across the island on police reform.
All three pieces of research centred around six thematic areas identified by the PRC,
which covered improving professionalism and standards, enhancing accountability and transparency, practising and upholding human rights, preventing crime, reducing the fear of crime and enhancing citizens sense of security, as well as increasing public trust and confidence.
In identifying and prioritising recommendations, the need to transform the Sri Lanka Police was highlighted as the eventual outcome to be achieved through the reforms process. Therefore, it is the view of the PRC that the design and implementation of all policing strategies should include an assessment of how these strategies will ensure that the rights of civilians are respected, while ensuring that the Sri Lanka Police treats its members fairly, with respect and dignity. This will be achieved by adopting a community policing centred approach.
The Sri Lanka Policing Reforms Action Plan 2017 includes key recommendations for policing reforms, which specify required actions, intended timelines for delivery and implementing bodies. The Reforms apply to all functional and territorial units of the Sri Lanka Police. It should be noted that as the reforms focus on policing more broadly and are not limited to police reforms, this action plan will include actions and support required from other key Ministries and key stakeholders to bring about effective transformation in policing in Sri Lanka.
A timeline for delivery is indicated for each recommendation and corresponding actions. Immediate refers to actions that should begin forthwith once the action plan is approved; Short term refers to actions that should be implemented within 1 year of approval; with Medium term between 1 to 3 years, and Long term referring to actions that should be completed within 5 years, at the latest.
Each Theme/Section of this Action Plan should be read together as complementing and contributing to achieving the overall vision to develop a professional police service that is accountable to citizens and the law, upholds good governance, and provides services effectively and impartially, to all.
The findings of the research revealed key factors that would serve as foundations or building blocks for effective implementation of the proposed policing reforms. Four aspects were identified as preconditions that would form the foundational basis for substantial reform.
Managing Strategic Change
Under Managing Strategic Change, the proposed reforms call for a significant shift in the approach to policing in Sri Lanka that will require the Sri Lanka Police to work closely with other Ministries and stakeholders.
This will involve reorienting the police force to adopt a community policing centred approach. In order to ensure a smooth transition, the Policing Reforms Committee identified the need to establish and invest in change management capacity within the Sri Lanka Police.
For monitoring the progress of the process, a policing reforms implementation and monitoring unit will be established within the Ministry of Law and Order and Southern Development.
This Unit will be headed by an Additional Secretary to the Ministry and will provide coordination and secretarial support to the Steering Committee as well as the Change Management Range located at the Sri Lanka Police. The Unit will translate the Policing Reforms Action Plan into Sinhala and Tamil, and will be responsible for implementing and designing external communications, under the oversight of the Steering Committee, and coordinate regular Monitoring and Evaluation of the Policing Reforms Action Plan.
Structural Reforms
As part of Structural Reforms, the research commissioned by the Policing Reforms Committee indicated the need for urgent organizational structural reform in the SLP. However, the PRC recognized that given the long history of the Sri Lanka Police, and the ongoing Constitutional Reform processes that could impact the form and structure of the Police, proposals for organizational structural reform would need further in-depth deliberations. Therefore, the PRC proposes that an Expert Working Group to Review the Police Structure is appointed in the short term to study existing research, studies, analysis regarding proposals for organizational structural reform, in collaboration with the National Police Commission and make recommendations on the most suitable structure to meet the objectives of the reform process, and study and analyse the rationale for deployment of police, and based on this study recommend alternate technology that would free police personnel from managing certain functions, for example in the Traffic Division.
The Expert Working Group will have representation from the Police Change Management Range and other government and civil society experts as necessary. Given the significance of this issue, the Chairperson of the Expert Working Group will be required to report regularly to the Steering Committee. Recommendations by the Expert Working Group should begin implementation within 3 years. The PRC notes that any reform to organizational structural change should be in line with the proposed Policing Reforms and the principle of accountability. Among the many aspects that will need to be reviewed with a view to improving efficiency and effectiveness, would be to review the rationale for current territorial and functional divisions including the Special Task Force (STF) and victim and witness protection etc; the deployment of resources and personnel geographically (to ensure that it is in line with population density and specific policing needs) and functionally (to reduce the time spent on non-core tasks, e.g. static security); and measures to address grievances among the ranks (by introducing specialization among Divisions, developing special interests for motivation purposes etc). It is further noted that re-structuring should go hand-in-hand with a personnel development plan for police officers who will be directly affected by change.
In terms of Resources, the issue of inadequate resources was highlighted as a major obstacle to effective policing in Sri Lanka. The community consultation highlighted the issue of late and inefficient police response to public complaints as a major obstacle to protecting human rights.
The public noted police attitude, lack of adequate personnel and lack of transport facilities or fuel, as a reason for delays. In the Police Survey, police officers indicated lack of transport (59 percent); lack of time to do normal work due to
extra duties (52 percent); lack of manpower (51 percent) and not being fluent in local languages (49 percent) as barriers to practising and upholding human rights.
Five key elements in reforming Sri Lanka Police
The committee has identified five key elements in reforming Sri Lanka Police and suggests recommendations for the ministry of Law and Order and Southern Development.
This section makes specific recommendations related to physical and material resources, while the issue of personnel or human resources is deliberated under the Section on Improving Professional Standards. The PRC believes in terms of resources, the principal aim should be to improve the quality of policing, and not merely increasing the quantity of resources at police stations.
Based on these issues, the PRCs recommendations includes strengthening the financial management system as the main recommendation, in addition to reviewing current financial management systems, including the budgeting and allocations procedure, focusing on cost efficiencies, assess spending decisions against strategic priorities. Improving resources and infrastructure is another recommendation.
Reviewing layout of police stations based on a model developed by the University of Moratuwa to ensure people-friendly police stations afford greater transparency, and secures the dignity of complainants as well as suspects, and provides access for the disabled.
In light of the above, it was decided to review the impact on the ongoing building programme for new police stations. This would include a costing of what it would take to influence design and layout of all new buildings and consider how existing stations would be altered over time, to ensure women and child friendly spaces within police stations, in addition to ensuring greater alignment with objectives of the Policing Reforms.
Investing in Data and Digital Infrastructure to build up the technological capabilities of the SLP at Aggregate and Functional and Territorial Level, digitalizing complaints and linking with ongoing review of the police communication system, were also recommended.
Deliberations on policing reforms highlighted the need for amendments to the Police Ordinance, in keeping with the priorities of the Policing Reforms. It was suggested that these amendments are developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders. The PRC Sub-Committee on legal reforms considered the need to either amend the existing Police Ordinance or draft new laws, and took an informed decision to wait for greater clarity on Constitutional Reforms.
Police officers were invited to submit their views on proposed amendments to the Police Ordinance. Twenty-four proposals were received after consulting OICs and other police officers. The PRC believes that the concept of community policing should be integrated into the new Policing Act or any amendments to the Police Ordinance.
The committee has identified five key elements in reforming Sri Lanka Police and suggested recommendations for the Ministry of Law and Order and Southern Development.
First among these is the Improving Professional Standards. The public in the community consultations expressed appreciation of the Sri Lanka Police and recognised the role the police play in maintaining security, law and order. However, a key finding of the research that was commissioned by the PRC revealed the need to work towards a courteous, respectful police service that upholds the rule of law and maintains a good relationship with the public.
Quality of recruitment, transfer and promotion systems
Central to professional standards were issues related to quality of recruitment, transfer and promotion systems, the need for clear job descriptions and effective training. Only 44 percent of police officers indicated having full clarity regarding expectations of them at work. This mirrored the findings of the community consultation which stated that police should have clear duty lists to enable police officers to be informed of their daily duties. Additionally, the Police Survey revealed that only 22 percent of officers reported continuous and regular feedback from superiors, with 66 percent indicating they received feedback occasionally during appraisal.
Furthermore, despite approximately 83,000 police officers, the community consultation on Police Reforms pointed to the lack of adequate police officers in certain locations as a reason for lack of effective and swift police response. The organisational analysis found that the workforce was largely immobile with police officers reluctant to relocate. Certain locations had larger deployments than can be justified.
In order to Enhance Recruitment it was recommended that a Commission be appointed to study under-representation of particular groups within the police, including demographic, geographic, representation to identify barriers and make recommendations to increase representation and diversity. Include a study on the police cadetting system, particularly regarding recruiting the calibre of youth needed for the police service in the future.
Commission a study on under-representation of particular groups within the police, including demographic, geographic, representation to identify barriers and make recommendations to increase representation and diversity. Include a study on the police cadetting system, particularly regarding recruiting the calibre of youth needed for the police service in the future.
Targeted recruitment of female police officers  20 percent at time of recruitment.
Promote bi-lingual proficiency at time of recruitment and initial training. Confirmation to be dependent on acquiring proficiency in anotherlanguage.
Enhancerecruitment from Tamil speaking areas.
Ensure recruitment of police officers with appropriate communications, interpersonal, language, cognitive skills and IQ as a prerequisite.
Review and update recruitment policy in keeping with the objectives and priorities of the Policing Reforms.
Develop clear job descriptions and specifications for all roles Profiling different roles in relation to the re-orientation of the Sri Lanka Police and develop clear job specifications and descriptions to ensure that all police personnel have clarity on expectations.
Ensure gender neutral job descriptions and specifications.
Strengthen the Code of Ethics
Review the recent Code of Ethics, and assess its impact on improving professional standards.
Strengthen the Human Resource Management function within the SLP.
Review existing studies/evaluations conducted by the SLP and the NPC on promotions and transfers. Identify options for resolving existing grievances.
Introduce effective performance appraisal system. Improve the promotion system linking to performance management, establishing clear criteria for awards and giving priority to assessing pending promotions.
Improve the transfers system, linking to performance management, establishing clear criteria and fair treatment.
Review the functioning of the Police Reward Fund and award of medals. Strengthen link to performance.
Criteria for placement and promotions from Driver to PC, PC to Sergeant, Sergeant to IP and IP to CI to shift from seniority alone to performance, achieving a 50:50 balance from 2018. This will apply to all rank within 5 years.
Develop deployment strategy to ensure that it is based on the specifications of the role, skills, training and experience.
Feasibility study and review the use of external suppliers for select tasks, where relevant.
Review public-police partnerships for non-core policing functions (e.g. monitoring pedestrian crossings).
Review cost efficiencies and effectiveness of employing civilians for back office/support staff. Improve training function in line with Policing Reform priorities.
Update previous assessments of SLP training institutions (National Police Academy, Police College, and In-Service Centers).
Review and strengthen basic training for all recruits, including on human rights.
Review training materials to ensure that community policing is established as the overarching approach of the SLP.
Review and strengthen specialized training (environment, traffic, gender, women and children, etc.) to develop career development pathways linked to the development of specialist skills. Update teaching of management skills in line with current best practices.
Increase resource allocation for language laboratories and simulation training (crime, traffic etc.)  moving beyond basic language skills to proficiency.
Establish a Central Performance Management System for performance at Station Level.
Assess and improve the Review and Inspection system for performance at station level to ensure greater focus on quality and delivery of reform objectives. Review grading of police stations every three years.
Review Departmental Orders in line with the Policing Reforms.
Review and update departmental orders in line with the Policing Reforms.

A school principals plight
Yet another sprat has fallen into the bribery net and had been made to pay for the felony. A lady school principal of an educational institution in Colombo has been sentenced to 8 years rigorous imprisonment, after being found guilty for accepting Rs. 25,000 to admit a child to the school. In addition she has been ordered to pay Rs. 5,000, and in default, a further two years is to be added to her RI term.
Harsh, one might say. This is considering the astounding swindles that are taking place in every sector today, involving millions of rupees, with none the wiser, and of course in the political arena, as is now being unraveled in all its juicy details. One time Sports Minister in the Rajapaksa government C.B. Ratnayake billed the education sector as the most corrupt, followed by police and the Cricket Board. Needless to say, he did not last long in the post.
What is Rs. 25,000 compared to what goes on elsewhere involving politicians and those in the corridors of power, one would be inclined to ask. We say this because it is well known that massive bribes are often given to politicians as an inducement to change sides, usually by the party in power. These may be in the form of cash, ministerial office or in lieu of withdrawing court cases against them. There was the instance where 18 UNPers crossed over to the government in 2008 to align themselves with Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was hell bent on obtaining the two thirds majority to have the Presidency for keeps. Of course, all were made ministers, although the common refrain at the time was they did what they did to strengthen the hands of the President to win the war, dheth shakthimath karanda.
Similarly, one witnessed one big crossover drama when CBK tried to get her Unit of Regions constitution passed in parliament, when MPs from both sides were making a bee line to the other side with monotonous regularity, the circus ending with a whole band of UNP MPs ending up in Singapore, in order to keep them out of temptations way, so it was said.
Nobody thought this episode important enough to warrant an investigation to ascertain who got what.
It is in this context that the lady principals plight has to be viewed - eight years RI for accepting Rs. 25,000. True, the court has to act based on the evidence placed before it, and, without doubt, the learned High Court Judge had ample evidence before him to declare the Principal guilty of the offence. It is also true, that this is only one instance of bribery in the schools sector, that, unfortunately spelt doom for the lady principal. But how many Heads, in the so called prestigious schools, are in the game, but have been careful enough to cover their tracks How many school Principals were under probe in recent times for having suspected to have accepted bribes from parents for school admissions What became of their cases What was the action taken against the Principal of an elite school, who went to the extent of setting up an additional classroom to facilitate extra admissions, in violation of the laid down rules True, he was transferred, but is that punishment enough Why did the probe end there
Not just during school admissions, there are other avenues of taking bribes. Parents, are, ad nausm, called upon to contribute to this fund or that fund of the school and invariably there are buildings coming up every year in the school for no apparent reason. Parents fork out fearing retaliation on their children. Recently, there was a public spat between two factions of an Old Boys Association of a leading school, one accusing the school Head of siphoning off millions from a school fund, and the other coming to his defence. No doubt, there is a web of intrigue involving school funds, both, in state and private schools, details of which come to the open only when the factions are unable to divide the spoils.
A concerted effort should be made by the authorities to clean up the Augean Stables in the schools system. The Ministry of Education should play a more active role in this regard, ensuring that school Heads conduct themselves in exemplary fashion and avoid scandals of the nature the public are now privy to.
It is hoped that the fate that has befallen the lady school principal will act as a deterrent to all school Heads to strive to be above reproach. They, after all, are entrusted with guiding the destinies of the future generations. A school principal getting involved bribery, let along being convicted for the offence, was a rarity in the past. But the transformation of society over the past few decades, undermining all values, ethics, moral principles and spawning greed, have compelled even school principals to sacrifice their better judgement on the altar of mammon.

Sigiriya Special Corr.
Samurdhi recipients have fallen into dire economic straits since the Rs. 2500 sanitation assistance given to them in 2014 by the prevision regime for building toilets and repair of houses is being recovered from their monthly Samurdhi allowance.
Samurdhi Managers have received written instructions from Government Agents to recover this allowance from Samurdhi beneficiaries.
A group of Samurdhi beneficiaries assembled near the Dambulla Samurdhi Bank were seen blaming the government for the inconvenience caused to them by recovering the money from their Samurdhi allowance at a time they had received a severe beating from the prevailing drought.
They alleged that this Rs. 2500 is deducted from their allowance at one stroke after obtaining their approval to deduct it in monthly instalments of Rs. 500 each.
They also allege that the Rs. 2500 grant was made to them in 2014 by the previous regime by withholding their subsidy given by Divi-Neguma Development Banks for a period of three months.

SLFP for 'clean and principled' politics
TARGETS EDUCATED YOUTH IN 66TH YEAR:
The 66th anniversary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will set the platform to launch a clean national movement, based on clean and principled politics, President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday.
The traditional UNP, SLFP and JVP divisions should now be set aside. Everyone should embark on this journey in the best interests of the nation, the President said, addressing a breakfast meeting with newspaper editors and media heads yesterday.
The educated youth have little faith in politics and politicians.They raise questions about integrity of politicians.We should draw the support and trust of this segment and the SLFP as a party, has understood this need. This sets the background for our 66th anniversary celebrations, the President said.
Over the past 10 years, bribery and corruption became the norm than an exception. It came from the top and engulfed the entire social body. The political body, the public service, the common public fell victim to this. It is not easy to rescue society from the current mire within a short period of time, he explained.
We inherited a country that was in the midst of a national tragedy. There was a political crisis, an economic crisis and an international crisis. We were entrusted with the task of saving the country from this situation.
We overcame the economic crisis through judicious measures. We also overcame the international crisis without undermining our sovereignty and independence as a nation. We overcame the economic crisis by securing the GSP+ concession and the facility to export fisheries products to the European market, the President said.
There are some sections who raise doubts about the governments performance. I have one question for them; what would have happened, if the former government remained in power after January 8, 2015, the President asked.
He dubbed the party founder, former Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, as a leader who initiated radical reforms in the countrys socio-economic and political spheres.
There are many similarities between the government of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and my government. We too are committed to implement drastic and radical reforms. We too face similar challenges, he added.

Southern Governor to probe unwarranted council meeting
Southern Province Governor Dr. Hema Kumara Nanayakkara will initiate an inquiry into the incident of holding the Southern Provincial Council special meeting on Tuesday contravening his directives requesting the Council Chairman to call off the meeting at which a vote was taken in respect of the draft of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution.
Governor Nanayakkara told the Daily News that he asked Provincial Council Chairman K.A. Somawansa in writing to suspend the council meeting on Tuesday, at which a discussion on the draft Bill was scheduled to take place.
The governor said: However, I was informed by the Presidents office that the Bill was to be amended and would be submitted again to the council for a dialogue among the councillors. Accordingly, I sent an order asking him to call off the meeting.
However, the chairman failed to heed my instructions. He took a vote on the Bill which was unethical and against the council tradition.
A section of the ruling United Peoples Freedom Alliance led by the Chief Minister and Ministers and the opposition United National Party members led by Opposition Leader Tennakoon Nilame did not participate at the meeting which they defined as illegal, Governor Nanayakkara said.
I am studying legal and constitutional issues on the matter to take action against the Chairmans unwarranted act, Dr. Nanayakkara said
Meanwhile, Council Chairman Somawansa when inquired said he would take legal action against the Provincial councillor who forcefully took the maize out of the chamber disrupting holding of the council meeting on Tuesday.

Sri Lanka steps up security after crowd trouble
Sri Lanka will deploy unprecedented security for todays fourth one-day international against India to prevent a repeat of crowd trouble which broke out following a humiliating defeat for the home side, police said.
Some 1,000 additional police will be deployed at the 35,000-seat capacity Premadasa Stadium in Colombo while CCTV cameras will be used to monitor the crowds, police said in a statement.
Any spectator who throws any bottles or projectiles at the players will be immediately arrested, they said.
Large number of fans lobbed bottles and other missiles and disrupted play for 32 minutes as Sri Lanka headed for their one-day international series defeat to India last Sunday.
Soon after play resumed at Pallekele with police evicting the rowdy supporters, India went onto to record a six-wicket win.
Sri Lanka's chief cricket selectors, who resigned en masse on Tuesday, said they were heartbroken when crowds turned against the team.
The heartbreaking incidents of unruly behaviour we witnessed at Pallekele last Sunday were the last straw for us, they said in a statement Wednesday explaining their decision to quit.
On August 24 Sri Lankan players had to remain inside the dressing room until police cleared hostile crowds after the team lost the second ODI by three wickets.
The ODI series loss came hard on the heels of India's three-Test series whitewash of Sri Lanka on home soil. - AFP

The statesmans speech
I am addressing you today from a historic place. It is from this spot that our ancient kings addressed the people. After independence, Prime Ministers of this country have addressed the nation from this very place. It is because you, the people, reposed your confidence in me that I am standing here to address you today. May I therefore express my sincerest gratitude to the people of this country for the confidence placed in me,
This royal sounding opening is from JR Jayewardene, newly elected Prime Minister, addressing the nation (July 28, 1977) from the balcony of the Dalada Maligawa. He was triumphant. At the General Elections held on July 21 (1977) the United National Party he led had secured an unprecedented 140 seats out of 168. Nearly 87% of the adult population of Sri Lanka had exercised their franchise to give an emphatic endorsement to the 71 year old veteran politician.
A few months later, in 1978, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting brought out a small booklet of J R Jayewardenes speeches titled A New Path. There are ten speeches produced, all delivered after the UNPs electrifying victory of July 21, 1977, and before the second republican constitution of 1978.
It is clear that he was heads and shoulders above the majority of his Party men, who as subsequent events were to show, were mostly careerists, in the lower sense. Public life was a mainly an ego trip for them, acquiring wealth and a social stature being primary. Jayewardene belonged to an older generation of politicians, a participant in the independence movement and a man of cultural sophistication and political depth. Coming from a family of lawyers, reading was habitual, and since it was essentially in English, wide and varied.
I was speaking of how the sovereignty of the people began, and I would like to cite from a book called The Office of Speaker by Philip Laundy, available in our library. King Charles I came with his soldiers. He came into the House. The Speaker was one Lenthall. His name should be revered though he is forgotten.
Parliamentary government
The King pressed the Speaker to surrender to him certain members of the House of Commons, namely Pym, Hampden, Hollis, Hazelrig and Strode. The House of Commons was not then elected as today, but it marked the beginning of parliamentary government.
By the time the King came these members had fled, swum across the Thames and escaped. The King said Well, since I see all my birds have flown, I do expect that you shall send them unto me as soon as they return thither.
The Speaker bowed down to the King and dropping to his knees said;
May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see, nor tongue to speak in this place, but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here; and I humbly beg your Majestys pardon that I cannot give any other answer than this to what your Majesty is pleased to demand of me.
For the first time, the Speaker of the House of Commons had declared his allegiance to the cause of parliamentary liberty. The King retreated.- From a speech made at the National Assembly on September 22, 1977.
There is more about Kings in the speech;
I would like to say, though we broke away from the monarchy of the United Kingdom, I always felt that the monarch was our own monarch because in 1815, when the Convention was signed, those who signed the Convention voluntarily replaced King Sri Wickrema Rajasinghe by George III, and King George III became the monarch of Sri Lanka in the same way that Tamil kings were brought here. A Nayakkar of South India came here and took the place of Sinhalese Kings.
Democratic or socialist impulse
It is interesting to note the frequency of reference to kingly tradition in a country said to be a democratic and socialist republic. Having no discernible history of either democratic or socialist impulse, we fall back on the familiar, institutions historically available as reference points. In societies where ideas of democracy and republicanism primarily developed, feudalism and kings - the surest symbol and bedrock of feudalism, are viewed by and large, as deniers of human rights and even human advancement; institutions that held the people in poverty and ignorance.
On the other hand, given the admiration here for feudal institutions, it is perhaps not surprising that in this so called democratic and socialist republic many a leader claims the mantle of leadership on the basis of birth, an entitlement, only to treat that public office as a hereditary right to be passed on to his kith and kin.
Could Sovereignty, an inherent right of the people, be transferred so easily by a set of befuddled feudal lords scheming hopelessly for personal gain, unaware that the days were numbered for the small world they inhabited Now, they were confronting men from many seas away; who knew much and had done much. That gaping difference in power, resources, knowledge and energy between the parties to the Convention renders it meaningless. If for example, they were compelled to use a modern constitutional instrument like a referendum, would it have been that easy for a few feudal lords to pass on the peoples sovereignty to a Nayakkar from South India and then to George 111 , living in far- away England If it is not accepted as a legitimate transfer, was not George III a usurper
Speaking further, Prime Minister Jayewardene (he was not yet President) moves on to more current issues How can a Minister who has 30 to 40 Corporations under him know what is happening in the Corporations That is why I want more Ministers. We can have 100 Ministers out of 140 and still have many left.
Very often during the period of the previous regime (i.e. the Srima Bandaranaike regime) the Minister of Justice put his finger into the DPP (Director of Public Prosecutions). We have evidence of that. If one of the Ministers friends was involved, no further action was taken by the DPP. That will not happen under our government.
Reading through the Jayewardene speeches we are struck by the sameness of the problems and preoccupations of our politics. It seems that JR Jayewardene was confronting the selfsame issues that confound his successors today. If there is to be a theme, it is a story of underdevelopment and general poverty with abuse of power, corruption and nepotism as the most distinguishing features of the status quo. While the leadership has been singularly inept at dealing with these evils, there has been no shortage of bombastic declarations, high-pitched denunciations and grandiose rhetoric. It was so then, and it is so now.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party ruled this country for seven long years and before that for four years (under Mrs. Bandaranaikes leadership). Her husband was Prime Minister, she was Prime Minister and now she is preparing the ground for her son to be Prime Minister!
So, having ruled the country for eleven years and been decisively defeated by the people, she now wants to stage a come- back for her family.
Speech made at the National State Assembly November 28, 1977.
In the same speech Jayewardene goes on to say-
We have permitted members of this House to sit on a select committee to examine appointments made by this government. They will also examine the appointment of diplomats who are not career diplomats, chairman of corporations and various other officials. We would examine their bank accounts, whether they have committed any offences and whether they are fit to hold that particular post.
We have abolished the Criminal Justice Commission laws because they were unjust. We could have used them as they were on our statute book. Members of this assembly were arrested under these laws. They had done no wrong but on a fiat of the Minister of Justice and the Prime Minister they were locked up.
They have freedom to put up posters (now). There was a poster I saw saying Chin Chin Nona has gone-Tom Pachaya has come. Pachaya means a person who speaks untruths. I suppose it was directed at me, but Chin Chin Nona is a reference to Mrs. Bandaranaike
On October 7, 1977, JR Jayewardene said in the National Assembly thus The Police must be fair by all, whoever they be. You cannot let the Police be judges. They are investigators. They keep the peace. They are not judges. They cannot lock up a complainant because he is a UNP man or a TULF man.
Consider the Dedigama by-election. There was a vote of censure moved in this assembly regarding that, and what happened I say that never in the history of democratic elections has there been such a violent abuse of democratic freedoms as at the Dedigama by-election by Srima Bandaranaike and her government.
Independent countries
In 1948, at the time of independence, statistically we were placed somewhere in the middle of middling countries. Not rich or powerful, but not as poor and desperate as some newly independent countries were. Due to a relatively developed infrastructure, established plantations, nascent industries and a broad education system Sri Lanka was considered a hopeful nation.
Thirty years later, when JR Jayewardene assumed office in 1977, much of that early optimism had faded, we were disillusioned and cynical. The economy, much of it under State control now, was stagnant. Insurrections, separatist movements, political/social unrest, corruption and a weakened public service had become everyday realities.
The massive swing towards the UNP that year was a desperate plea of a despairing nation. Was the nation betrayed by a leadership, unequal to the task Forty years since that exhilarating electoral victory of 1977 what has really changed In the interim, we have had many new beginnings, many new journeys (gaman) many more new launches and innumerable invoking of blessings.
Surprise, surprise, after these innumerable beginnings and journeys, we are still in the middle of middling countries! Several countries which were behind us then, such as South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia are now well ahead. Others, much poorer and weaker than us in 1948, having found their footing, are now on the march, making it that much harder for us to compete.
A new path, a new beginning

Suzuki launches Dzire in India
Japans Suzuki Motor Corporations Indian arm and the leading car-maker in India, Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL), has launched the all-new Suzuki DZIRE compact sedan in India on the 16th of May 2017.
The all-new Suzuki DZIRE sedan is a combination of modern sleek and elegant looks infused with encompassing state-of-the-art technology. The DZIRE is one of the main models of MSIL and it is Indias largest selling sedan with accumulated sales of approximately 1.4 million units in India, since inception.
The all-new Suzuki DZIRE shares the same new HEARTECT platform as those adopted for the all-new Suzuki Swift, which is being sold in Japan, Europe, and other countries from 2017. Thanks to its lightweight and high-rigidity body, it strikes a balance between running performance and fuel efficiency, while meeting safety regulations that are scheduled to be introduced in India.
Encompassing all the virtues of a true sedan, the all-new DZIRE is all set to shake the compact sedan segment yet again.
It comes with an entirely new design, which lends it impeccable sedan proportions. Indulgent interiors with urbane satin chrome and burl wood ornamentation and a unique flat bottom steering wheel give passengers a plush experience.
The now popular and much-admired AGS (Auto Gear Shift) technology will be offered on both petrol and diesel variants. New-age technologies such as a touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto would complement the allnew DZIRE. Under the hood lie the acclaimed 1.3 liter DDiS 190 diesel engine and the proven K Series VVT 1.2 liter petrol engine.
While the primary focus of the all-new DZIRE will be in India, it will be exported to Indias surrounding countries, Sri Lanka, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America, subsequently. The pioneer of the Sri Lankas motor car industry, Associated Motorways (Private) Limited (AMW), is the sole agent of brand new Suzuki vehicles in Sri Lanka.

'Thailand keen on strategic partnership with SL'
The 17th Annual General Meeting of the Sri Lanka - Thailand Business Council (SLTBC) was held at the Waters Edge, Battaramulla recently. It was held under the patronage of President of the Council Rizan Nazeer.
Ambassador Designate of Thailand to Sri Lanka Chulamanee Chartsuwan who graced the event said the Royal Thai Embassy would like to express its deep appreciation for the work done by the SLTBC and its able executive board to promote trade and investment between the two countries throughout the past two decades. Following is an extract from her address to Council members.
"I look forward to furthering the existing excellent relations with the Business Council to further win-win economic relations.
"In 2016, Thailand and Sri Lanka governments set a target to triple trade value between the two countries from presently US$ 500 million to US$ 1,500 million dollars by 2020.
"With this ambitious trade target set by the governments and with my strong economic background, it is not by chance that I have been assigned to be Ambassador to Sri Lanka today. Thailand Week with the first Thai Trade Fair organized in less than one month after I landed here. My mission is clear from Day 1.
"On the investment side, there is no set target. With the Thai investment value jumping 10 times from US$ 70 million in 2015 to US$ 700 million in 2016, mainly through the investment by Siam City Cement in Insee company, there is no reason not to expect much more investment from Thailand.
Just one very concrete example was another historic day in our economic relations when the Joint letter of Intent was signed between Sri Lanka's BoI and Rojana Industrial Estate to establish Milleniya Export Processing Zone in Kalutara District.
"This EPZ - Sri Lankas first industrial zone in over a decade - is expected to create 10,000 new jobs through 100 manufacturing operations and the number of manufacturers operating there is expected to double at a later stage when the EPZ is expanded from the initial 400 acres to 1,000 acres. It is hoped that the approval and construction of infrastructure, which usually takes five years, would be completed in one year and the project ready by end 2018.
"Thailand has already submitted a draft MoU on a strategic partnership with Sri Lanka. We identified in the draft MoU a number of areas of mutual interest. The next step is to develop a plan of action.
"By early September the Ministry of Primary Industry is going to sign a cooperation MoU with the Bank for Agriculture and Cooperatives and Kasetsart University, with a view to developing the primary industries in Sri Lanka through capacity building and knowledge sharing and to exploring the possibilities of obtaining credit lines to support the entrepreneurs engaged in exports and imports related to primary industries.
"Second, I have been instructed to follow up with the Sri Lankan side on Thai - Sri Lanka FTA negotiations. I have been in close contact with the Ministry of Commerce, which is responsible for this FTA negotiations.
"Third, I set as my mission to identify areas where Thai and Sri Lankan businessmen can trade and invest. The areas of agriculture and processed food, gems and jewellery, electronics, automative parts, rubber, hospitality including hotel management, alternative energy, are some of the areas floating between both sides.
"I pointed out to the Thai businessmen, and they agreed, that the competitive edge of Sri Lanka lies in its strategic location. Sri Lanka has rightly positioned itself as maritime hub for South Asia and this point offers strategic interest to the Thai business sector.
"That is why after two months of posting here, I have chosen my first B2B project with the theme of logistics. I brought a number of Sri Lankan companies to logistic trade fair called TILOG - LOGISTIX, as well as to Laem Chabung, our biggest port. Very soon I will lead embassy staff to visit the Hambantota Port and airport, to have a better appraisal of its potential.
"Second, with its small consumer base, Sri Lanka has been positioning itself as a gateway to South Asia through its bilateral FTA networks with South Asia. While this positioning is welcoming, investors might already compare the incentives and advantages offered here in Sri Lanka with those offered by neighbouring countries with much bigger population base. Therefore, investors are looking for cost effective labour, ease of doing business, easier tax structure, stronger incentives; in short, more business friendliness and confidence.
"Third, one Thai company gave me a homework and I would appreciate if anyone here could help me do this homework. The homework is  how can Thai investors work with their counterparts in Sri Lanka to access the market in Great Britain, probably through the Commonwealth scheme, now that Brexit is becoming a reality. Brexit is making a big transformation to trade between Asia, Thailand included, and Europe and my homework is how Sri Lanka can play a role in this transformation."

Vikara AND VISIONS
Inspired by his life experiences Nuwan Shilpa Hennayake will present an exhibition of pen drawings and digital art on Saturday 2 and Sunday 3 September 2017 at the Lionel Wendt Art Gallery from 9 am to 8 pm. Nuwan Shilpa Hennayakes journey in art flourished just four years ago, while he was reading for his Bachelors Degree in Architecture in USA.
Though he was inclined towards painting and drawing as a child, he only partook in it as a pastime. This eventually grew into a full-time pre-occupation at which point I made a decision to drop out of university and pursue art in accordance with my disposition, Nuwan said.
Nuwan believes that Art has allowed him to visually express the way he understood his life experiences and gain insight into the nature of his temperament. Art for me is a discipline for mental development, and the closest I would come to consider as devotional, he added.
Influenced by visionary, psychedelic, and shamanistic art of renowned artists; Alex Grey, Pablo Amaringo, Amanda Sage, Ernst Fuchs and Android Jones to name a few: Nuwan confirms that his biggest influence is music. Good music always motivates me to make art. Music plays a central role in my life and I think that its impact has naturally has made its way into my work. My thinking is also influenced by works on philosophy, psychology and other social sciences
The artwork in Vikara and Visions is the cumulative effort of the last two and a half years. Nuwan presents two themes during this exhibition: Vikara deals with theme of transformation. The title itself is taken from the Sanskrit word for transformation/change. Observing how ignorant we are of the consequences of our actions of planetary toxification and destruction, a sane future is to be considered, healing this collective psychosis. The first step of this process is a diagnosis. Through this body of work, I explore my contribution to the collective psychosis as reflected in my own predicament.
The series, Visions is a set of photo manipulation experiments. The theme for this body of work is patterns. Fascinated how the world exhibits pattern, at every level. macro and micro. It is not just a phenomenon of physicality and form, but one that extends into the realm of the mind and thought. The patterning of thought can be visualized into forms. Visions is an expression of this aesthetic. - SH

The optometrist in me was very happy to see a larger number of people getting tested for the first time. Seeing them realize the importance of an eye check up, educating themselves of their impairment and taking corrective steps was a very satisfying aspect of the project., said Dasantha Fonseka, CEO of Vision Care.

War crimes allegations against former Army Commander reflects LTTE ideology still prevailing
The war crimes allegation levelled against former Army Commander General Jagath Jayasuriya, who also served as the Ambassador to Brazil, reflects that LTTE ideology still prevails despite its defeat militarily, said Military Spokesman Roshan Seneviratne yesterday.
Responding to a query by a journalist during the Cabinet briefing, the Brigadier refuted allegations levelled against General Jagath Jayasuriya.
He also added that baseless allegations had been made against military personnel since the end of the war in 2009.
The recent lawsuit filed against former Army Commander Jagath Jayasuriya, reflects that LTTE ideology still prevailed though it was defeated militarily in the country, he said. Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said they would continue to take legal action against specific allegations levelled against military personnel based on evidence.
However, not all killings and everything that took place during the war are violations of human rights, Minister Senaratne said.
"They think all killings during the war against the terrorists was human rights violations. But it was an operation against terrorists."

Whats in store for the exile
The political fallout from the resignations of ministers Ravi Karunanayake and Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe are still being felt within government, the latter more than the former, even as the Joint Opposition hands over yet another motion of no-confidence, this time against Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
Karunanayakes resignation, in a sense, was straight forward enough. Following evidence led at the Commission of Inquiry into the sale of Central Bank Treasury bonds, it emerged that the controversial Bond dealer Arjun Aloysius had paid the rent for apartment Karunanayakes family resided in. That there was a conflict of interest was apparent and, after resisting for a few days, Karunanayake bowed to pressure from the public, the opposition and his own party and resigned from the Cabinet after making a speech in Parliament where he noted that he has not been found guilty of any wrongdoing.
Rajapakshe was different. His own party, the United National Party (UNP) was moving to submit a motion of no-confidence against him on the grounds that he was violating the collective responsibility of the Cabinet by opposing the sale of the Hambantota port to Chinese interests. He was also charged with stalling investigations against individuals in the previous government. Rajapakshe dug his heels in and the UNP had to request President Maithripala Sirisena to remove him, which the President did.
It is understood that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe attempted to defuse the crisis that was erupting over Rajapakshe in the party. In discussions with the renegade minister, the Prime Minister is reported to have offered Rajapakshe the choice of remaining in the Cabinet with the Buddha Sasana portfolio if he was to apologise for his conduct. Rajapakshe was adamant and refused the offer and had to be removed.
Rajapakshes replacements have been announced. Thalatha Atukorale has been appointed Minister of Justice while Gamini Jayawickrema Perera has been appointed Minister of Buddha Sasana, in addition to the portfolios they now hold.
Atukorale is also the Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare. She is the sister of the late Gamini Atukorale who was once deputy minister to Ranil Wickremesinghe. Gamini Atukorale was also a long time General Secretary of the UNP when Wickremesinghe was its leader. He passed away on New Years day in 2002after a sudden illness, shortly after the UNP came into office. He was then Minister of Transport, Highways and Civil Aviation.
Thalatha Atukorale entered politics after her brothers death and is reputed for being outspoken. She has in the past criticised the party leadership when the UNP was in the midst of a leadership crisis. As the new Minister of Justice, Atukorale has already pledged to expedite corruption related cases.
Rajapakshes resignation
Gamini Jayawickrema Perera is an old faithful of the UNP, being one of three parliamentarians who entered the legislature in 1977 and are still in Parliament, the others being Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and Leader of the Opposition R. Sampanthan. Perera also holds the portfolio of Sustainable Development and Wildlife.
After the drama over Rajapakshes resignation last week, questions were being asked about his political future, the most obvious being whether he would join the Joint Opposition (JO). Rajapakshe remained tight-lipped saying only that he will take a decision about his future in due course. At present, he remains a member of the UNP. He is also a member of the Constitutional Council, a position he may continue to retain as there appears to be no provision to remove members of the Council.
Rajapakshe was seen at the Bellanwila temple last Friday, as the temple staged its annual perahera. Attending the same occasion alongside the deposed minister was former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, fuelling further speculation. However, the body language between the two, while cordial, did not suggest a great camaraderie and Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe seemed uneasy in the former Presidents presence.
Former President Rajapaksa would not have forgotten that Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe once left his Cabinet causing much embarrassment to his government. Nevertheless, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe now stands accused of protecting the Rajapaksa regime and politics has seen stranger bedfellows get together when their mutual needs dictate that they do so.
However, if Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe expected a red carpet welcome from the JO, he would have been disappointed. In the events leading up to his dismissal, there was some speculation that he would be the next common candidate from the JO, presumably for the next presidential election.
This rumour was gaining such currency that the JO was compelled to officially deny it. Addressing a news briefing, parliamentarian Dilum Amunugama said the Joint Opposition never sought a common candidate and would not do so in the future. We will field our own candidate, not a common candidate, he said. However, asked if the JO would accept Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe to their party, Amunugama said they would accept not only Rajapakshe but anyone who was willing to join them.
Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, the astute reader of politics that he is, must realise he cannot chart a political journey on his own- he needs an established political party to be his vehicle, if he has greater political ambitions. When he quit the Rajapaksa cabinet, he joined the UNP. Therefore it is now highly likely that he would now revert to the JO, perhaps after a decent time period.
However, he would then face the issue of how he could join the same group of persons he cited as corrupt and criticised vehemently in the name of good governance in the lead up to the presidential and general elections in 2015, a tactic which then endeared him to the public. Therefore, if he does join the JO, he risks being classed as yet another political opportunist.
As he remains in the UNP at least for now, Rajapakshe still retains the option of remaining a backbencher, maintaining a low profile and then re-emerging, perhaps with a different portfolio. This is the strategy that Ravi Karunanayake hopes would be successful for him. However, at this point this seems unlikely as Rajapakshe spurned all the offers of a compromise that were offered to him by the UNP leadership which valued him more as an asset than as a liability.
Already, Rajapakshe has indicated that he will not be maintaining a low profile or toeing the UNPs line. This is an attempt to sweep the bond scam under the carpet by sacrificing me. In Sri Lanka's history, this is the first time a minister was accused of not influencing the judiciary and the Attorney Generals Department whereas former justice ministers had been accused of influencing the judiciary, were Rajapakshes scathing remarks to the media following his removal.
It seems that Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has decided that his course of action, though questionable in the short term, will yield long term political dividends by increasing his popularity, just as his resignation from the Mahinda Rajapaksa Cabinet did.
Motions of no-confidence
The government meanwhile is bracing for another no-confidence motion, now against Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne. Senaratne entered Parliament from the UNP at the last general election but, as one of the few ministers to walk out of the Rajapaksa Cabinet along with Maithripala Sirisena, he enjoys a special relationship with the President.
The no confidence motion against Minister Senaratne cites several issues, the alleged inability to deal with the Dengue epidemic and the controversy over the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) being among them.
Unlike the motions of no-confidence against Ravi Karunanayake and Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, the motion against Senaratne has little realistic chance of success. Sections of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) may not approve of Senaratnes policy towards SAITM but President Sirisena is likely to prevail over them to refrain from voting for the motion, even if they wished to do so. The UNP, of course, will fully endorse Senaratne and oppose the motion.
It is not that the JO is unaware of this. However, given the impact the motions of no-confidence against Karunanayake and Rajapakshe have had, they will relish the opportunity to have their say, even if Senaratne finally has his way. For the JO, it will be an exercise in public relations within the chamber of Parliament, no more, no less.
