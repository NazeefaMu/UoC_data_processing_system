GMOA attempting to bring down Govt.
The Government Medical Officers Association(GMOA), has turned into a politicised-trade union-mafia that is advocating a project to bring Mahinda Rajapaksa and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa back into power, UNP Parliamentarian Mujibur Rahman said yesterday.
Holding GMOA President Anurudhdha Padeniya and his henchmen responsible for attempting to obstruct the development process of the country, MP Rahman urged the medical professionals to protect the people's respect they had earned for their profession.
All of you must have seen who Padeniya sits with during a particular programme. That is with non other than Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. It is very clear as to what type of political agenda Padeniya and GMOA have.
MP Rahman also said that the GMOA is promoting fascism and dictatorship, while trying to establish a monopoly within their profession. They are trying to bring down the government by blackmailing the general public. The general public should not permit themselves to be suppressed by such a mafia organization as the GMOA.
UNP MP Rahman made these observations at a press brief held at the Sirikotha, UNP headquarters yesterday morning. He condemned the GMOA for moving into trade union action against the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement. Trade Union action is to be launched from August 3, 2018.
MP Rahman also spoke about the luxuries partaken by GMOA members. Their initial salary exceeds Rs. 167,000. For a specialist it is around Rs. 250,000. When they are providing on call services, they are paid Rs. 50,000.
They get a vehicle permit with a value of Rs. 3,600,000. These people have used free education to come up to this level. But they are blackmailing the general public for political agendas, he said.
MP Rahman also pointed out that numerous countries in the world have signed free trade agreements with Singapore, as it is the economic hub of Asia. Sri Lanka needs this FTA. Singapore wont lose anything by not being able to sign an agreement with us, but we will. Look at the way in which the GMOA acted when we started the Suwaseriya Ambulance Project. They spread all sorts of rumours. Now, what do they have to say about it They are not even mentioning the significant steps taken by the government to strengthen the health sector of this country. They are not talking about the prevailing issues with regards to the health sector, but are worried about the FTA. They dont have a solid argument against the FTA either, MP Rahman further pointed out.
Similar to the GMOA, the Joint Opposition is also trying to create bogeymen to destabilize the development projects initiated by the government, MP Rahman said.
The same boogeymen stood against when Sri Lanka signed the Indo-Lanka agreement. During those days they said that Sri Lanka would become a colony of India. After so many years had passed it happened No. All these are boogeymen they are creating. We should not allow these boogeymen to destroy our economic potentials, he added.
Meanwhile, asked if there was a rumour that UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa is to give up his post and position saying that he was unable to work with the rest anymore, MP Rahman denied the allegation.

Women to be involved more in sub sectors of construction industry
Sri Lankan governments move to broad base engineering education will boost women participation in development activities of the country to a great extent, said Architect Prof. Chitra Wedikkara.
Despite the fact that industry is considered as a male dominated career, it currently employs more women in areas such as Engineering, Architecture, Quantity Survey and design.
Wedikkara made these remarks participating in a discussion on, Women Friendly Cities Challenge, jointly organized by the National Chamber of Commerce, Sri Lanka and World University Service of Canada (WUSC) recently.
Nerveless, female participation in the area of technical education remains notably low. We have looked at women to be included in sub sectors of the construction industry such as painting, tiling, plumbing and plastering.
During the last year, 40 selected women across the country undertook training in painting.
This year, plans are also underway to provide training to another 40 women in painting, 20 women in tiling and 10 women in plastering.
Noting that very less women are getting into development activities in Sri Lanka, Wedikkara said that Moratuwa is the only university that has the highest female student intake for engineering education in Sri Lanka mainly due to its location and, female students comprise close to 60% of overall students at Moratuwa University.
While female engineering students in rest of the faculties, located outside Colombo consists of 20%.
She also urged the need to introduce more women friendly cities to enable women to fully participate in the economy of the city as well as the country.

Framework for future CMC tax administration
Advanced automated taxation system - a South Korean example
Sri Lankan and South Korean officials have finalized policy recommendations and a framework to develop the future Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) tax administration system by capitalizing the experiences of the advanced tax information system in Seoul, South Korea.
Colombo is the economic centre of the country experiencing rapid urbanization and land development resulting on higher tax rates imposed on land and buildings which account for 28% of total budget of CMC. However, due to existing manual taxing method, CMC is currently facing serious challenges such as uncertain data on taxable property, and missing to charge tax and inefficient administrative procedures.
Therefore, there is an urgent need to build a strong tax information system, especially for the Colombo city which generates considerably high amounts of tax, according to a Korean Embassy statement.
The Sri Lankan and South Korean officials continued consultations through the Knowledge Sharing Program (KSP) policy consultation supported by the Export-Import Bank of Korea (Korea Eximbank) to set up a master plan for the establishment of an advanced automated taxation system for CMC. The program was conducted successfully from February to July 2018. The final dissemination seminar was held on July 26 in Colombo with the participation of Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) officials including the Deputy Municipal Commissioner Thamara Mallawarachchi.
Following the consultations, an improvement model has been proposed which is largely aimed at components such as standardization of administrative work among CMCs internal divisions, establishment of a system for external linkages with other land related agencies, integration of databases, improvement of efficiency in rates assessment by linking land information with the existing GIS system, digitalization of assessment related formats, and establishment of a portal for taxpayers.
Furthermore, future directions have been proposed including revitalizing the Single Window Center to integrate all local taxation services, the Embassy statement said.
If this proposed framework for automated taxation gets implemented in future, it will not only help CMC to become a model in taxation and administration to other local authorities in the country but it will also contribute to Sri Lankan governments plan to establish the e-government to reform taxation administration and cut fiscal deficits in the long-run.

Ballet to cure the traffic blues
Remedios Rosas was walking down a Mexico City street Saturday when she saw seven tutu-clad dancers tiptoe to the sidewalk, their chins held high, and join pedestrians waiting to cross the road. When the light changed, music started and the dancers leaped into the street, twirling and twisting in front of surprised drivers.
The 58-second show - the duration of a Mexico City traffic light - is part of a theater company's attempt to brighten the days of motorists at snarled intersections in this sprawling megalopolis notorious for its clogged roadways.
Rosas ran home and brought back her two grandchildren to enjoy the street performances, which featured music ranging from ballet classics like Swan Lake and the Nutcracker to Michael Jackson's Rock With Me. The sound system was a boombox plugged into an iPod. "It's great for families that we have the opportunity to see them here on the street," the grandmother said.
Fighting the noise of car horns and rattling engines in the northwest Mexico City neighborhood, the group danced to the tune of seven different songs, each complemented with its own routine and bright costume.
The idea of the performances was inspired by photographer Oscar Rodriguez, who captured portraits of the dancers in the streets. Now, the performances are part of an initiative called "the theatricality of public space." The theater company is called Ardentia.
Since the performances began two weeks ago, the dancers have drawn the attention of a stable of photographers, videographers, and even a drone operator, all looking to capture a story that continues to grow.
"We never thought this was going have to this kind of impact," said one of the dancers, Manuela Ospina Castro. "Not only are people accepting it, but they need it. They need these kinds of activities to get closer to art".
Perched atop his bicycle, Juan Pablo said he pulled to the side of the road when he came upon the performance and stayed to watch the entire event. But children are the most delighted. Daniela Jacqueline Luna, one of the grandchildren brought by Rosas, said her favorite part of the performance was when dancers "move their feet." One day, she said, she wants to become a ballerina herself now.

Bank of Ceylon, peerless service over 79 years
The Bank of Ceylon celebrated its 79th anniversary on August 1, 2018 with its main ceremony at the Banks head office premises with the participation of distinguished customers, well wishers, the Chairman and the Board of Directors, the CEO/ General Manager together with members of Corporate and Executive Management and staff.
Similarly every BOC branch celebrated the day with their distinguished customers, well wishers and staff. In line with the anniversary celebrations the Bank held a multi religious service and a blood donation campaign to mark the significance of the day. It launched its upgraded Smart Online Banking system that includes added features. As a reward to all newborn babies in the month of August 2018, the Bank of Ceylon presented its free gift Upathaka Mathakaya, a baby record book to capture precious moments of the baby till he/she grows up and a free Ran Kekulu Account with the initial deposit of Rs. 250.
Further to the ceremony on August 1, the Banks Buddhist Association has organized a Pirith ceremony on August 3, 2018 night and an alms giving on the following day morning to invoke blessings of Triple Gems on the Bank, its staff and all its customers.
As celebrations begin for the 79th anniversary, it necessarily calls us to look back at the Banks Journey as the No.1 Bank in the country. It has been a strenuous path to travel with many success stories to share but a well paid off journey. I must say the Benefits of all these achievements have been uncompromisingly shared with all Sri Lankans. I would like to take this as an opportunity to thank all our distinguished customers, the Government of Sri Lanka, the staff of BOC and all our stakeholders for support and well wishes. said Chairman, Presidents Counsel Ronald C. Perera.
Moving forward with the digital revolution the Bank of Ceylon has now reached its customers through the latest technology that empowers them throughout the day. This was done by confronting challenges that came from all directions by developing market leadership, confronting market volatility, tunneling and aligning resources to ensure business growth and transforming the banking landscape digitally.
The bank has made its services available to customers through many unconventional modes such as Social media and online modes. B-App, Smart Online Banking, Smart FD, Smart Passbooks, Apply Online Loan facility are some of the initiatives that assist customers to access the Bank without having to visit a branch to get their banking needs fulfilled. Then, newly introduced facilities such as BOC Digi- the state-of the-art self serving banking facility outlet in Kandy City Center and which will be expanding to ten other strategic locations, Branch on Wheels- mobile branch allocated to each province that goes to the customers door-step to provide service, wide-spread ATM/CDM network consisting over 900 machines, over 190 SmartZones and 24 hour banking counter at the Banks Head Office Personal branch ensure customers have access to seamless transactions throughout 24 hours a day, Chairman said.
BOC believes that it has genuinely added value by these initiatives that empowered customers to carry out their banking anytime, anywhere whenever they need to. Whilst retail banking unit offers smart banking products for individuals from any walk of life, Micro, SME and Corporate banking offers the best-in-class facilities for entrepreneurs in the country to live their vision. Working hand-in-hand with the Governments vision to develop the entrepreneurship in the country through financial inclusion, Bank of Ceylon is at the forefront to reach the grass-root level young Sri Lankan entrepreneurs through programs such as Thurunu Diriya and Enterprise Sri Lanka, said CEO/ General Manager, Senarath Bandara.
The Bank promotes several Micro and SME industry entrepreneurship development schemes in support of the Governments mission to accelerate the countrys economic development through enhancing contribution coming from these segments.
The recently launched enterprise Sri Lanka program is one of the most prominent in this regard whereas entrepreneurs in every industry is covered by formulating different types of loan schemes where the Bank can cater to a variety of entrepreneurs whose requirements and fields of competencies are unique and needs to be addressed in a tailor made way.

The history of 79 years as the No.1 Bank in Sri Lanka is an extraordinary story to tell. Being recognized as the No.1 Brand in the country by Brand Finance Lanka for the 10th consecutive year, the saga of Bankers to the Nation began with the need that arose for a state aided Bank to assist Ceylonese Businessmen just before the World War II. With the essential combination of quality customer service and integrity the Bank of Ceylon came to be known as BOC over the years, building a base of 12 million loyal customers who consistently seek a credible financial service.
By 2018 the brand BOC was rated with a brand value of Rs. 42.87 billion by Brand Finance Lanka which is the highest brand value recorded. In recognition of this achievement the BOC was awarded as the No.1 Most valuable consumer Brand and No.1 Rank Banking Brand in Sri Lanka by Brand Finance Lanka in 2018.

This indigenous brand was yet again recognized internationally as a MasterBrand for the year 2017-2018 by the CMO council Asia and was named among of the Top 1000 Banks in the world for the 7th consecutive year by the The Banker U.K. Magazine.
With the fundamental strength that was built over the years and the adapting to the agile nature of the banking industry with new technology, the Bank of Ceylon has become the house hold banking brand-BOC throughout Sri Lanka. BOC encompasses a structure that is sustainable in the longer-run which is developed around a profound vision, mission and a set of corporate values. The assurance the Bank has earned throughout these years is by now validated by all stakeholders especially all Sri Lankans.
With the essence that was built to serve the Nation, Bankers to the Nation -BOC has created a powerful image within the Sri Lankan community as a credible and a trusted financial partner that delivers to the genuine need of the people for more years to come.

Perhaps the apt way to begin a list of Englands firsts is by stating the obvious  on Wednesday, 1 August, they will become the first ever team to reach the milestone of 1000 Tests.
Let that sink in a bit  1000 Tests. It was a journey that began back in Victorian times, when the world, and indeed the sport, was unrecognisable from what it is today.
Cricket has come a long way, and England, the sports early pace-setters, were its pioneers, playing a huge role in shaping it.
Heres a list of things they did, mostly before anyone else.
FIRST TEST
England and Australia played the sports first official Test, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground from 15 to 19 March 1877. Australia won the match by 45 runs, largely thanks to Charles Bannermans 165. Bannerman helped Australia post 245 in the first innings, and though England fought back with 196, Harry Jupp scoring a half-century, Australia added 104 in the second innings before bundling out England for 108.
FIRST CAPTAIN
James Lillywhite (jnr) led England out for the first time in that historic first Test. A left-arm spinner, he would go on to play another Test as well, later that month, and was said to be a capable umpire in later years.
FIRST WIN
England didnt have to wait long for their first victory. In the second Test at the same venue, England would prevail by four wickets for their first ever win in the format. A thrilling encounter in which both sides put in all-round displays, it had England chase down a target of 121, despite being 9/3, thanks to George Ulyetts half-century.
FIRST WICKET
Allen Hill, a round-arm medium paceman, had the honour of being Englands first wicket-taker. He had Nat Thomson bowled for just one in that first Test  it would be his only wicket of the innings. He would go on to pick up 4/27 in the first innings of the second Test, though.
FIRST CENTURY
It had to be him: WG Grace. Crickets first superstar scored the first ever Test century by an Englishman, stroking a 294-ball 152 against Australia at the Kennington Oval. It was the fourth Test ever, from 6 September 1880, and the home side won it by five wickets within three days. For Grace, it was a century on Test debut  he would score one more in Tests, and a staggering 124 in first-class cricket.
FIRST DISMISSAL
John Selby became the first English player to be dismissed in Tests. Selby was seen off by John Hodges for an 18-ball 7 on the second day of that inaugural Test. Selby would still go on to play six Tests, scoring two half-centuries en route, so its safe to say he didnt let the ignominy affect him too much.
FIRST SERIES WIN
Englands first series win came at home, when Australia toured in 1880. England won the only Test in the series at the Kennington Oval, with Grace scoring their first ever century, by five wickets. It was a match that ebbed and flowed, but the home side held firm for a famous victory.
FIRST FIVE-WICKET HAUL
Alfred Shaw, the slow right-arm bowler, became the first England bowler to claim a five-wicket haul in that inaugural Test. Shaw returned 5/38 in the second innings, seeing off Thomson (7), Tom Garrett (0), Bransby Cooper (3), Jack Blackham (6) and Dave Gregory (3). Shaw would play six Tests more, and end with 12 wickets at an average of 23.75.
FIRST TEN-WICKET HAUL
This was a long wait, as much as it was an improbable feat. Jim Laker was eventually the man to do it, in July 1956. That it came against Australia would have only pleased the Manchester crowd that much more.
Laker returned a remarkable 9/37 in the first innings with his off-spin, and as if that wasnt enough, he went one better the next time around. He returned 10/53 in the second innings, dismissing Australia for 205 as they followed-on, to become the first, and so far only one of two bowlers, to claim all the wickets.
FIRST XI: Harry Jupp, John Selby (wk), Harry Charlwood, George Ulyett, Andrew Greenwood, Tom Armitage, Alfred Shaw, Tom Emmett, Allen Hill, James Lillywhite jnr (capt), James Southerton.

Cricket legends slam Sumathipala on match fixing allegations
Cricket legends and former Sri Lanka captains Arjuna Ranatunga and Aravinda de Silva jointly denied the statements made by former Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala that they were involved in match fixing.
Sumathipala had named Ranatunga and De Silva as two players who started match fixing from Sri Lanka and alleged that they had taken $15,000 from someone by the name of Gupta. The former SLC president had made these comments to reporters in Anuradhapura.
Replying to these allegations at a press conference held at the Ministry of Petroleum Resources Development yesterday, De Silva said, I never bother about statements made by politicians. Even my friend (Arjuna Ranatunga) is a good politician but I never bother about what he says. But the accusation made against us by Thilanga Sumathipala was investigated by the ICC headed by Queens Counsel Desmond Fernando and the ICCs Anti-Corruption Panel, Jeff Rees, and fellow investigator Alan Peacock and after the inquiry we were cleared from the allegation.
I dont know why Thilanga is talking about the inquiry which was concluded by ICC. I have been working for the selection committee of SLC and I even declined a salary because I like to contribute to Sri Lanka crickets development, said de Silva.
Speaking further De Silva said that Thilanga had also invited him to contest for the vice presidency of SLC on several occasions.
My question to him is why did he invite me to contest if I am a person who is involved in match fixing
Ranatunga said that Sumathipala was playing a dirty game to hide his corruptions. He questioned why Sumathipala went to Dambulla Stadium prior to the first ODI between Sri Lanka and South Africa to inspect the ground without any knowledge of it. I can understand if someone like Sanga or Murali went to inspect it.
Aravinda and I have never played for money while representing the country. It is during Thilangas period as president for the first time in the history of Sri Lanka Cricket domestic cricket fixing has happened.
If bookies come to power ultimately fixing will happen. We should change the SLC constitution and the present system of voting otherwise our cricket will be simply destroyed, said Ranatunga.

The air force helicopter sound digitally aired to blend with a particular scene of the drama was a novel experience for the viewers.
Actor, Sumudu Mallawarachchi said, the theme of living in harmony is a norm accepted by the majority of people in the world and the object of Janakaraliya is to nurture and communicate this message to the masses.
The motivation and vigor of this multi-ethnic team of youth to popularize the message of Janakaraliya is tremendous.

Grooming ground  of the genius
The British capture for more than 100 years took a heavy toll on the Sinhala nation and the Buddhist religion. Therefore, for the continuation of the nation and religion, Henry Steel Olcott, Venerable Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera and Venerable Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera established a great education centre named as Ananda College. Unfortunately, at the first session of the college, it only sheltered the children who lived nearby Colombo. But in 1914, 28 years since inception, with the establishment of a hostel by C Batuwanthudawe, F R Senanayake, the opportunity was available to educate the children in the remote areas. P M Menan was the first warden of the Ananda College Hostel which started in the reign of the former principal Fritz Kunz. Instrumental figures such as J Madanayake, J Wijethunga and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa repaired the hostel on several occasions to bring its name and position into a higher state.
The Mother Hostel of Ananda College gave birth to many educated Sinhala Buddhist citizens for the future of the country.
As a tribute to that mission and the 104th anniversary of such an imperious accommodation, the O/L batch of Ananda College Hostel is organizing the Hostel Day 2018 which will be held on August 1 at 2.30 pm.
The Hostel Day 2018 will be graced by the old hosteller, the Director of the Department of Sports development, Buwaneka Herath as the chief guest and it will be a memoir with the presence of the old Anandian Sachithra Senanayake as the invitee singer of the event.
Also, a prize giving will be conducted for the winners of the Inter-Dormitory Literary Competitions, Inter-Dormitory Sports Competitions and the Inter Hostel Literary Competitions which was held among the island-wide schools.
The Hostel Day 2018 which will be filled with many entertaining items such as songs and dances. The Ananda College Hostel Day 2018 organized for the welfare of the hostel will visualize the dedication, determination and the superior courage of the hostellers when it will be staged and crowned at the Kularathne Auditorium of the College.

The President made these remarks at a ceremonial felicitation of Minister Dr. Senaratne on his election as the Vice Chairman of the World Health Organisation. The felicitation ceremony was jointly organised by the Health Service Union Federation, Health Ministry and the World Health Organisation.
President Sirisena further said the health sector was subjected to radical changes under this government under the guidance of Minister Senaratne.
"Accordingly, the prices of 48 varieties of essential drugs have been brought down drastically. Besides, the prices of stents have also been reduced significantly, ie; the price of a normal stent from Rs. 75,000 to Rs 24,000 and a medicinal stent from Rs.350,000 to Rs. 105,000. Moreover, eye lenses are offered free of charge while a cancer patient is treated without any monetary limits. Earlier, a cancer patient was allocated only Rs.1.5 million and thereafter, the patient had to choose between bearing the additional expenses or death. As a result of passing laws to display pictorial warnings on cigarette packets, it is observed that there has been a signficant drop in the number of smokers," the President said.
These are a few of the significant achievements in the country's health sector after 2015, President Sirisena said.
President Sirisena further added that the present government was able to implement the Prof. Senaka Bibiles drug policy 45 years after its introduction.
As a former Health Minister, I tried to implement Prof. Senaka Bibiles Drug Policy, but the draft of the drug policy was misplaced at the Legal Draftsmans Department, the President said.
The President added that he faced many difficulties when trying to implement the 80 per cent pictorial warning on cigarette packets in 2012.
The then Head of State threw away my Cabinet Paper to display 80 per cent pictorial warning on packets of cigarettes saying that no foreigner would come to the country, if they couldnt smoke a cigarette, the President said. President Sirisena further added that real democracy is being exercised at the Cabinet meetings now.
The Ministers are allowed to freely debate the Cabinet Papers unlike the previous regime.
The President said that he felt really happy after hearing that Minister Senaratne was appointed to the post of World Health Organisation Vice Chairman.
President Sirisena added that when Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva was once elected as the Chairman of World Health Organisation, the then Head of State never felicitated him or uttered a single word to encourage him.

Import tax on wheat flour to discourage consumption
The government will introduce an extra import tax on wheat flour to discourage its consumption, if there is a surplus paddy production this season, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
A bountiful paddy harvest is expected in the Yala season. Rice import has completely stopped, he said.
He was participating in the inauguration of Dhakshina Krushi Navodaya, Agricultural Exhibition at the Labuduwa Farm in Galle, recently. The exhibition was organised by the Southern Provincial Agriculture Ministry.
Our country is gifted with fertile land on which any kind of farming can be done. Fruits can be grown in any region. Nevertheless, we annually import 54,000 metric tons of fruits. Once, Bibile was famous for oranges. However, we spent Rs. 950 million to import oranges a year. Earlier, grapes were cultivated in Jaffna. However, we spend a massive amount - about Rs. 2,766 million - every year to import grapes. Meanwhile, we further spend Rs. 1,315 million for the importation of ginger and turmeric which can be easily grown in our country. Similarly, we bear a massive expenditure on the import of several food items which can be cultivated on our soil, the minister said. We need to stop this. We have to evolve a new national programme to cultivate crops that can be grown on our soil, the minister said.
Implementing a budgetary proposal, we have insured farmers growing maize, onion, potatoes, beans and green chilies island-wide. Accordingly, one hectare of cultivated land is insured for Rs. 100,000. However, the opposition alleges that the government has done nothing for the progress of agriculture. This is ridiculous, he said.
He added that in the past, farmers faced many obstacles in selling their produce at reasonable prices. But during the past few months, we assured good prices for farmers produce, the minister said.
Referring to the recent progress of the Labuduwa Farm, the minister commended the officials and workforce for their dedicated and honest contribution towards transforming the once loss-making organisation into a cost-effective state farm.
Southern Province Governor Marshal Perera PC, Southern Province Agriculture Minister U.G. D. Ariyathilake and Galle District Parliamentarian Wijepala Hettiarachchi also spoke.

England play their 1000th Test match:
India eager to cement No. 1 status with series win
LONDON, Monday: India may be the worlds top-ranked Test side but they still face accusations they are lions at home and lambs abroad.
But a series win in England, where Virat Kohli's men begin a five-Test campaign at Edgbaston on Wednesday, would go some way to ridding India of that unwanted tag.
In the past five years, India have won just one of their six Test series outside of Asia, against a struggling West Indies.
Their overall Test record in England is uninspiring -- six wins from 57 matches and three series victories -- 1971, 1986 and 2007.
But if the current prolonged hot weather in England continues, the upcoming series may well be played on dry and dusty pitches, more akin to the surfaces that are found in India, rather than traditional green English seamers.
Also, while doubts persist about England's ability to cope should either one of veteran new-ball duo Stuart Broad and James Anderson get injured, India do at least have some pace-bowling depth.
Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah may be unfit for the first Test but the likes of Mohammed Shami, Ishant Sharma and Umesh Yadav have shown themselves to be capable operators outside of Asia.
Anderson is a master of conventional swing, but India may have the edge if conditions favour reverse-swing during what will be England's 1,000th Test match.
They seem to have got a good variety of bowlers and strength in depth in their pace bowling, said England opener Alastair Cook.
In the last ten years I've played them, they haven't had the option of playing five or six different types of seamers, added Cook, Englands all-time leading Test run-scorer, whose highest score of 294 was made against India at Edgbaston in 2011.
Meanwhile India captain Kohli, one of the outstanding batsmen of his generation, will be desperate to prove he can score runs in England.
He managed a meagre 134 in five matches during his maiden Test series in England in 2014, which India lost 3-1 with one draw.
But Mohammad Azharuddin, the India batting great, believes everything is now in place for Kohli to have a successful series.
"I think he will perform wonderfully well," Azharuddin told AFP in Delhi.
He has led India in so many Test matches, so I don't think he will have any pressure now as far as leadership is concerned.
England captain Joe Root, who like Kohli is at his best when leading from the front, comes into the series having converted only three out of 23 fifties since his Test-best 254 against Pakistan in 2016 into hundreds -- a poor return for a player of his ability. Batting could hold the key to the series and there are question marks against both top-orders.
England, following a 1-1 drawn series with Pakistan, are sticking with Keaton Jennings in the hope of at last finding a reliable opening partner for Cook, while Indias Shikhar Dhawan and Cheteshwar Pujara have both been struggling for runs.
We are not worried at all, because both are really quality batsmen, said India's Ajinkya Rahane of his top-order colleagues.
It just takes one good innings to get into your rhythm.
India would appear to have the edge in spin bowling but off-break bowler Ravichandran Ashwin has rarely performed as well outside of Asia as he has in the sub-continent.
Left-armer Ravindra Jadeja is an experienced campaigner while left-arm wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav has forced his way in after impressing during the preceding one-day series.
White-ball form also led England to recall Adil Rashid even though the leg-spinner has not been playing red-ball cricket for Yorkshire this season and he could team up with off-spinner Moeen Ali.
Hes a very good bowler, said Rahane of Rashid.
Wrist-spinners, we all know they are wicket-takers -- and right now, in England weather-wise, it's like playing in Mumbai or Chennai.
Probable teams and officials:
ENGLAND: Alastair Cook, Keaton Jennings, Joe Root (capt), Jonny Bairstow (wkt), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler, Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid, Sam Curran, Stuart Broad, James Anderson
INDIA: Murali Vijay, KL Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli (capt), Ajinkya Rahane, Dinesh Karthik (wkt), Hardik Pandya, Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Kuldeep Yadav

Madhu Shrine, a sacred area
The Cabinet has approved a proposal made by President Maithripala Sirisena to declare the holy shrine of Our Lady of Madhu a sacred area. The President visited the Madhu Shrine on Sunday.
This is a most welcome measure for Roman Catholics in the country.
Madhu is a mystic jungle shrine dedicated to Mother Mary and venerated not just by the Catholics of this country, but by members of all religious faiths. It is situated in a remote area in Mannar.
For more than 400 years, Catholics as well as non-Catholics have gathered around Our Lady of Madhu and it is believed that this holy shrine has miraculous powers which have served the spiritual needs of Sri Lankans from different walks of life, ethnicities, religions and different areas of the country.
For more than two decades, in the midst of the conflict and mass displacement, Madhu Shrine also served as a place of refuge for all affected people. Madhu Shrine has been recognised locally and internationally as a safe haven and place of refuge for people fleeing conflict and destruction.
Even during the war, the Church administration has always maintained the shrine and the surrounding area purely as a place of religious worship and a place of refuge for displaced people. It was strictly kept out of bounds for any type of military or political activity.
However, during the height of the war, when the Church administrators felt that the shrine was in danger, they managed to take the sacred statue of Our Lady of Madhu with them, despite the strong protests from the LTTE. The Bishop of Mannar at the time took measures to place the statue of Our Lady at St. Francis Church Mission.
The sacred area was also declared a no war zone and the Sri Lankan security forces spared the area from military offensives during the recent conflict.
Speaking to the Daily News, Director of the Aquinas College of Higher Studies, Rev. Fr. Benedict Joseph welcomed the move by the President. He said the Madhu feast is scheduled to be held on August 15 and is expected to be held on a grand scale. This move gives us a chance to show our devotion to the Blessed Mother who is very close to the heart of every Catholic. Even non-Catholics have a soft corner for the Blessed Virgin. To date, people of all walks of life have honoured this shrine as it is not restricted to the Catholic community. Even when the Pope visited the country, he made it a point to visit the Madhu Shrine.
There are numerous legends regarding the Shrine of Our Lady of Madhu, which has a history of over 400 years. However, it is widely believed that when the Dutch took over the country and started promoting Christianity in the form of the Dutch Reformed Church, especially in the coastal regions, around 20 Tamil Catholic families from Mantai in Mannar fled inwards with a statue of Mary and settled down in an area called Marutha Madhu.
It is believed that later another group of Tamil Catholics had also joined them.
The Portuguese missionaries from India, especially Saint Francis Xavier, are said to have brought Roman Catholicism to the Kingdom of Jaffna. Many in the region embraced the Catholic faith. Legend has it that the Madhu Shrine was originally called the Shrine of Our Lady of Good Health.
In fear of profanation of the statue and persecution by the Dutch, a group of families had taken the statue to the jungles in the Mannar area (Madhu), which was under the Kandyan territory, in order to save the sacred statue that they are said to have guarded with their lives. It is believed that the Virgin Mary had provided protection to this group of people who were so devoted to her.
In the calm forested area of Marutha Madhu, the little group of Catholics grew in numbers under Our Ladys protection, while persecution raged throughout Jaffna.
It is also believed that during this period, another group of Tamils from the Jaffna Peninsula were moving towards Maruthu Madhu to escape Dutch persecution and had sought refuge in the Wanni. Catholics believe that it was nothing but a miracle that this group too was miraculously led towards Maruthu Madhu after wandering for days in anxiety and fear.
It is said that the two groups of Catholics had then met. A lady among the group who is known as Helena is believed to have been the one responsible for building the initial shrine for Our Lady of Madhu and the little church in her honour.
The Church was consecrated in 1944 during World War II. A marble altar replaced the old wooden structure in preparation for the consecration ceremony and the whole sanctuary was built with white and blue marble.
Even during the war, despite the dangers posed and restrictions placed on movement in these areas, over 30,000 devotees attended the feast held at the sacred jungle shrine. Despite its ruthless reign of terror, even the LTTE respected this festival and did not prevent the devotees from attending the feast.
It is also reported that the statue of Our Lady of Madhu was taken in procession thrice to other parishes in Sri Lanka - in 1948, 1974 and in 2001. The last was as a spiritual effort to encourage Catholics in Sri Lanka to pray for peace and an end to the civil war.
Meanwhile, in 1870, the new Bishop had arranged an annual festival to be celebrated on July 2, but it is the August 15 festival that still draws the biggest crowds because it is one of the most hallowed days for Catholics celebrating the feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and also because the school holidays facilitate entire families to make the trip.
After the Madhu Shrine was taken back from the grip of the terrorists by the Army, the shrine of Our Lady of Madhu was given back to the diocese of Mannar.
Despite war-time bombings which caused serious damage to the church of the Sacred Heart located to the right of the shrine, the shrine itself suffered only light damage along its left side and roof.
On Sunday (July 29), President Sirisena, accompanied by family members, visited the shrine of Our Lady of Madhu in Mannar and engaged in religious observances. Colombo Archbishop Rt. Rev. Dr. Malcolm, Cardinal Ranjith, Mannar Bishop Dr. Emmanuel Fernando and Rev. S. Emiliyanus Pillai conducted the mass.
Catholics all over the country will welcome the announcement by President Sirisena declaring the Madhu shrine area a sacred site, a measure that would add to the significance of the feast of Our Lady of Madhu on August 15.

MADHU;DECLARED SACRED AREA
The Cabinet yesterday approved a proposal by President Maithripala Sirisena to declare the Holy Shrine of Our Lady of Madhu in Mannar as a sacred area.
The Shrine of Our Lady of Madhu is a much respected and venerated shrine to Catholics and for more than 400 years, Catholics and non-Catholics have visited the Holy Shrine to pay homage.
The Shrine also attracts Buddhists and Hindus devotees for veneration. Subject to ravages of the ethnic war dire need for constructive rehabilitation was becoming very evident due to immense hardship faced by the thousands of devotees making pilgrimage to the Shrine.
Madhu Shrine becomes the first Catholic Shrine to be declared a Sacred Area in the country.
For more than two decades, in the midst of the conflict and mass displacement, Madhu Shrine also served as a place of refuge for all affected people. Madhu Shrine has been recognised locally and internationally as a safe haven and place of refuge for people fleeing in the face of war and destruction.
The area where the Holy Shrine is located was in a state of neglect for some time due to the war.
Infrastructure and other facilities were not developed properly because of war and with the declaration of the region as a sacred area a major development drive is to be launched to improve infrastructure and other facilities in the area.
The government plans to develop roads, transportation, water supply, sanitation, accommodation and other facilities in the area as proposed by President Sirisena.
This is a long overdue and most welcome measure for Catholics in the country as well as non-Catholics and foreigners who visit Madhu.
President Maithripala Sirisena, accompanied by close family members paid a visit to Madu Church and obtained blessings on July 29.
President Sirisena, after receiving blessings, discussed the development activities of this sacred church and area with Most Rev Emannuel Ferdinando, Mannar Bishop and the management clergy of the Madu Church and Archbishop Dr.Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith.
The President also exchanged views with the large gathering of devotees from different communities who were present at the Church and visited the surrounding area to inspect the existing facilities.

Need for a democratic political culture
A group of politicians overthrown by the voters with their cohorts seem to scramble through the present political arena of the country crafting their strategies to grab the power in the forthcoming elections, be it the presidential elections or elections for the provincial councils.
We the general public have got to be politically conscious of their manoeuvres, for their detrimental nature can drag the country into the abysmal depths of chauvinism and anarchy. This must be said because the about-face of the political landscape of the country is more than the indiscipline of expected democratic political culture. The harder truth is that many politicians have no productive options except pouring eloquence on building political images.
Admittedly, this stubborn reality has to be done away with if a coherent democratic political culture is to be firmly established to steer the country out of this stenching political bog. What I mean by a democratic political culture is the genuine political will of both politicians and the people as the basic requirement for democracy to flourish. In a democratic political culture, particularly men or women who lead political parties are not worshipped as idols but they are open to public scrutiny and criticism. To our dismay, what is happening today is not taking ardent efforts or taking appropriate decisions for nation building but venerating their own political leader as a god given personality heaping all the virtues on him as the only saviour of the country. These cohorts act almost impulsively not to speak out about political issues that impact the good governance and development process of the country, but to idolize their leader as the best political figure. In a way, they bring out this hazard for achieving their own political elements, for it is quite clear, many of them will be dumped into the political dustbin by the people if they do not hang themselves onto the colours of their leaders.
Chauvinism
The dirtiest and worst strategy a politician can adapt to get him hooked to the power is to run on the wheel of chauvinism. Some garrulous and unself-conscious politicians who describe themselves as the political whiz kids of the day seem to go to the wilderness of chauvinism merely to evoke emotions among the people depicting a picture that the country is on the verge of being engulfed in flames of yet another internecine war.
There is a high price to pay if we emotionally involve the people in such notions that can kindle their emotions particularly when it comes to the topic of national security and integrity. Therefore, any utterances made towards chauvinism are likely to be fraught with the risk of dragging the country to the shimmers of the turmoil of ethnic disharmony. Elimination and annihilation of any views pertaining to chauvinistic politics must be one of the priorities of the genuine peace loving politicians and the members of the civil society.
Concerted efforts
It is high time we brought in consensus among all the politicians of various hues and all the communities to lay down a common framework for a democratic political culture that will pave the way for establishing a new society to work for the common goal of nation-building without being trapped in communal politics.
Any attempts that deter such a move by any politician or an individual must be looked down upon. Politicians should not degrade themselves to such situations for running on the wave of communal politics for selfishly achieving their personal political goals. It is the responsibility of the existing government to initiate on a campaign with the full cooperation of the other political parties to have a very compressive discussion for the stipulation of the fundamentals of such a framework that can be accepted and followed by all the political parties of the country.
What is badly needed in the post-war period of the country is to work for creating a democratic political culture that can take firm roots in the Sri Lankan society and it will then leave no room for communal tension and disharmony between the ethnic groups. Though attempts have been made by the governments for constructing a bridge for national integration, they have not so far been able to create a conducive political culture where all the masses of the country irrespective of the ethnic group and religious faiths become committed to being active members striving to build a Sri Lankan society.
Voters responsibility
It has been a common phenomenon in the Sri Lankan political scenario that the majority of the voters are blindly glued to their respective political parties or allies. They are not used to critically looking into the policies of their political parties and then to decide on the political party to be brought into power. If a stalwart of their political party commits a heinous crime and is convicted by a court, what the voters do is to make big efforts to find excuses to wash him or her of the wrongdoing merely for the sake of winning the elections. Yet what should be the primary duty of the voters in a democratic political culture Whatever they do or any decisions they take must be to protect the democratic culture.
If a politician of his party behaves in an undemocratic manner, it is the duty of the voter to reject him even though he is a big personality. But, our political culture does not seem to have grown to such heights. The main repercussion of this situation has therefore been to persistently strengthen the decaying and rotten values that hamper the process of building a democratic political culture for the country.

South Africa keen to extend lead in series
Once bitten Lanka looking to turn things around
DAMBULLA, Tuesday: Rain in Dambulla is a rare occurrence. Thats what the Sri Lankan team experienced towards the end of their practice session at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium yesterday as they prepared to take on South Africa in the second ODI under lights today.
The possibility of rain interfering with play cannot be ruled out as it is quite cool here at this time of the month.
Having lost the first ODI (a day match) played here on Sunday, Sri Lanka has to raise their level of play and turn things around if they are to be in contention in this five-match series. Another loss is what they cannot undergo as the pressure will be too much on them to win the next three matches on the trot  something which they have not achieved in recent times.
South Africa ranked 3 in ODIs in comparison to Sri Lankas 8 are favourites to win the series if one is to go by the ICC rankings. But it doesnt always work out that way for in the Test series Sri Lanka ranked 6 outplayed number 2 ranked South Africa.
Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews examines the Rangiri Dambulla Stadium pitch with head coach Chandika Hathurusingha during practice yesterday. - AFP 
Unlike in the Tests pitches prepared for the ODIs are not heavily spin-oriented they have to be in favour of the batsman because limited overs cricket is a batsmans game. In that aspect Sri Lanka who dominated the South African batters with spin in the Tests have to find new ways and means of winning.
Man of the Match in the first ODI South African left-arm spinner Shabraiz Shamsi described the pitch prepared for the first ODI akin to what they get back in Pretoria and the Wanderers with hardly any spin.
But where Sri Lanka lost was not because of the state of the pitch but because their top order failed miserably against South Africas fast bowling attack led by Kagiso Rabada to put up a competitive total on the board for their bowlers to have any chance of drilling holes in the Proteas batting line-up.
Sri Lanka will have a slight edge in the second ODI because it will be the same pitch that will be used for todays match and the chances are that it will be drier than what it was three days ago. Bearing that in mind Sri Lanka may opt for an extra spinner to their line up at the expense of one of their fast bowlers Lahiru Kumara who has been ruled out of the match after splitting the webbing between the ring and little finger of his left hand during training.
As Sri Lankas batting coach Thilan Samaraweera pointed out South Africas strength lay in the first 8-10 overs where their fast bowlers Rabada and Lungi Ngidi come hard at you. If Sri Lanka can survive that initial ordeal of pace without losing wickets the batsmen should be able to put up a substantial score on the board. This was substantiated by the Kusal Perera-Thisara Perera 95-run stand for the sixth wicket where 64 runs were taken off the six overs bowled by Willem Mulder and Andile Phehlukwayo who had replaced Rabada and Ngidi.
Skipper Angelo Mathews is quite aware that in ODI cricket it is a different ball game where the wickets are not dusty and spin oriented like in the Tests and that his bowlers will have to think out of the box to outwit the South African batsmen.
We need to play well in our conditions. They are an experienced side. The Test series I am sure they have learned a few things and while batting they are countering the threat posed by our spinners. We have to counter those plans, said Mathews at the pre-match press conference yesterday.
We didnt bat well and the batters know that we cant do the same mistakes again. It was disappointing to lose five wickets within the span of eight overs.
If we could have negotiated those eight overs, we could have been in a different position. Losing so many wickets put the middle order under pressure. We would like to rectify that in our next game.
We strive to improve every day. Training will be the same but the mindset has to change. We dont have to over think too much. We have four games to go and we have an opportunity to turn things around, he said.
TEST WICKETS WERE SANDPITS ITS DIFFERENT NOW - RABADA
Rabada said the key to his success bowling on sub-continent pitches was adapting to the conditions.
Your game plan changes when there is not much assisting you. Youve got to have different skills and bowl different lengths. Its all about adapting. I am open to learning. Always not shy to try things and put myself under pressure. At the end of the day, it is the basics. You need to do the basics right and learn different skills.
You dont get the same wickets in sub-continent from what you get at home in South Africa. Like I said just adapting and bowling different lengths is the key. Test matches were completely different. They were just sand pits. Its completely different now. There is good bounce more like a one-day wicket, he said.
Sundays victory was South Africas ninth win in a row against Sri Lanka and Rabada put it down to them having executing their game plans well whether it is the batters or bowlers.
He said that it is important after a good start to carry on with the momentum. We are just looking to continue our game plans. Try and make it 2-0 heading to Kandy which will give us a massive advantage.

Open warrant re-issued against Jaliya Wickramasuriya
Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday, re-issued an open warrant for the arrest of former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States Jaliya Wickramasuriya due to his failure to appear before Court.
The FCID had filed a B report at the Fort Magistrates Court against Jaliya Wickramasuriya for allegedly misappropriating USD 330,000 out of USD 6.6 million allocated for the purchase of a building for the Sri Lankan Embassy in the US.
When the case came up before Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne, neither the suspect nor the sureties were present in Court.
At a previous occasion too, the Court was informed through the Defense Counsel that Jaliya Wickramasuriya had gone abroad for medical treatment with Court permission, but had failed to return before the due date. The Defense Counsel said that his client was still receiving treatment at a hospital in USA.
Accordingly, the Magistrate yesterday, re-issued warrants for the arrest of the two sureties including the wife of Jaliya Wickramasuriya, for their failure to appear before Court.
Meanwhile, the Court issued orders directing 79 banks and non bank financial institutions that financial transactions pertaining to Jaliya Wickramasuriya be provided to the FCID to carry out further investigations.
The FCID was directed to file a report regarding the progress of the investigation on August 27.
The FCID alleged that the suspect had misappropriated the concerned amount committed during the purchase of a building to house the Sri Lankan Embassy at 3025, White Haven Street, Washington 20008. The former Ambassador had remitted this money to Sri Lanka. The former Ambassador is a close relative of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Parents can take legal action if trained teachers not provided - PM
Parents can take legal action against the Education Ministry if trained teachers are not provided to schools in future, the Prime Minister said.
Parents will be given the right to obtain the services of trained teachers to schools attended by their children in future.If any future government failed to fulfill this obligation, parents will also have the right to go before courts and obtain the redress by recourse to the law of the land, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was addressing a meeting after opening a new building complex at Gintota Zahira Vidyalaya in Galle on July 30.
As much as buildings and equipment, trained teachers are also essential to develop a school. Training is a quintessential factor for ensuring a proper service to the people whether it be at a hospital, school or any public utility, the Prime Minister said.
He said during his tenure as Education Minister he decided to provide training to all teachers and set up Colleges of Education to recruit and train teachers systematically by a process of selecting the teacher trainees.
This was implemented in 1985 and 86 on the lines of the education system in countries such as Thailand and Malaysia.This system he introduced to provide trained teachers to all schools was subsequently politicised causing great harm to education.
As a result a large number of untrained teachers are now serving in the school system today. But these teachers could not be blamed for this sorry situation as their appeals for training facilities went unheeded by the previous regime.
The Prime Minister said during discussions held with Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam they decided to fulfill the pledges held out to the people regarding education.
Recruitment of teachers would not be handed over to politicians. Instead legal provisions would be made to ensure quality education.The burden of maintaining a high standard of education in schools would be vested in Principals. Only trained teachers could be recruited to schools within the next five years.The government would make the recruitment of teacher groups two to three years in advance and provide training so as to assign them to schools. If these provisions by law are not adhered to, parents would be given the right to petition courts and obtain a ruling against any politician involved or the Education Ministry itself. Unless these provisions were made available the trained teacher recruitment programme will not succeed, he said.
These laws and regulations implemented in the UK and New Zealand have been made available to the Education Ministry to formulate its own set of regulations.
After the local regulations were formulated they would be forwarded to the President and the Cabinet for approval before enacting them.
Minister Vajira Abeywardena, Parliamentarian Wijayapala Hettiarachchi and several other politicians and state officials were present.

He was addressing the media in Colombo yesterday.
The union has sent the demand in writing to the Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. Closing down the university, especially the Medical Faculty is unacceptable due to an issue of another faculty, he said.
The State medical faculties including the University of Peradeniya Medical Faculty commenced academic work after a long break.
They did not function for nearly one year because of the SAITM issue, he said.
Minister Rajapakshe should intervene and open the Medical Faculty as soon as possible.
If the faculty is not opened soon, the union will stage a major protest in the Peradeniya University shortly, he said.

Rekindling the glory of Polonnaruwa
The ancient capital of Sri Lanka, the city of Polonnaruwa, the seat of great kings, will awaken to its pristine glory once again with the completion of as many as 170 projects under the President Maithripala Sirisenas flagship, Pibidena Polonnaruwa on August 1, 2 and 3.
Pibidemu Polonnaruwa (Awakening of Polonnaruwa) District Development Project was commenced on October 17, 2017. The President, symbolizing the commencement of the project laid the foundation stone for a new classroom building of Aralaganvila, Vilayaya Madya Maha Vidyalaya.
Under this ambitious development project, all sectors in Polonnaruwa including roads, electricity, agriculture, education, health and environment will be developed comprehensively.
When some areas in Sri Lanka were marching towards a rapid transformation during last decade, I was lamenting as the representative of the people of Polonnaruwa due to the inability to make the relevant transformation for Polonnaruwa President Sirisena declared. Polonnaruwa will be taken to a rapid development through Pibidena Polonnaruwa, giving the benefits of the development to the people in this district.
Polonnaruwa, the second capital of ancient Lanka after Anuradhapura, is a World Heritage Site and forms part of the UNESCO-sponsored Cultural Triangle.
When the first capital Anuradhapura faced continuous invasions from Tamil kings across Palk Straits, in the seventh century, the city was abandoned and the capital transferred to Polonnaruwa or Pulastyanagara, the site probably of a prehistoric city named after Pulastya, the grandfather of Ravana, according to Sir Ponnambalan Arunachalam.
The scenic city of Polonnaruwa soon rivalled Anuradhapura in magnificence. Although the new capital too fell to invading forces, King Vijayabahu I recaptured Polonnaruwa in 1055 and ruled until 1110.
The most respected monarch who ruled the island from Polonnaruwa, however, was King Parakramabahu I or Prakramabahu the Great who ruled from 1153 to 1186 and acclaimed by historians as the greatest of Sinhalese Kings.
Rich heritage of Polonnaruwa
The Polonnaruwa era was so peaceful and disciplined, even a woman might traverse the island safely with a precious jewel and not be asked what it was, as Dambulla inscription recorded.
Parakrama Samudra  the sea of Parakrama  remains a lasting monument to his memory. Covering 2,400 hectares, this giant reservoir is the largest created during the medieval period. It has an embankment 12 km in length. It is said that blocks of stone weighing 10 tons each were used in the constriction.
The rich heritage of Polonnaruwa is evident from monasteries and the Buddha statues such as Gal Vihara where four Buddha statues and attendant sculptures cut from a single rock represent the finest achievement of the local sculptor.
The Polonnaruwa kingdom did not last long ending with Magha (1215-36). Threatened invasions from South India forced the kings to abandon Polonnaruwa and move to Dambadeniya.
Since then, it was a sad tale of decline and neglect. After several centuries, Polonnaruwa is reawakening today under the development programme, Pibidena Polonnaruwa.
President Maithripala Sirisena, a son of Polonnaruwa, stated that the government has started the programme to uplift all people economically and socially.
More than 170 projects have been implemented under the Pibidena Polonnaruwa and they will be vested with the people during the first three days of next month. They include Technical College Complex, Polonnaruwa General Hospital revamps with state-of-the-art facilities and services, the new Court Complex, modern bus halt and main roads with four lanes.
The implementation of the Moragahakanda Kalu Ganga Multipurpose Development Project fulfilling a long-awaited aspiration of the farmers. The Kalu Ganga Moragahakanda Project that was constructed at a cost of Rs. 2,300 million, which is almost three times the entire cost of the previous projects of the accelerated Mahaweli Multipurpose Project. Farmers of Polonnaruwa will receive water for irrigating their parched lands during the Yala and Maha seasons now.
The capacity of Kalu Ganga reservoir is 265 million cubic metres and will divert 100 million cubic metres a year to the Moragahakanda Reservoir. The reservoir will irrigate 3,000 hectares in the Kaluganga basin.
Water from both, the Moragahakanda and Kalu Ganga reservoirs, will be primarily used to support agricultural needs to an area of at least 81,422 hectares. This will increase rice production by 81% or 109,000 tons, amounting to an estimated monetary benefit of US$1.67 million, annually. In addition to irrigation of land, water from the Moragahakanda Reservoir generates 25-megawatt power at the Moragahakanda Hydroelectric Power Station.
One of the greatest gifts for the people of Polonnaruwa will be the National Nephrology Hospital, which is a gift from China. The construction works commenced under the patronage of the President to build the hospital two weeks ago. This New Hospital is being built as the largest kidney hospital in South Asia, at a cost of Rs. 1.2 billion, fulfilling long-term aspirations of the President to provide services for kidney patients. The hospital would be a great asset and a gift to the people of Sri Lanka, not only for the people living in the North Central Province but also in other areas. The hospital project includes state-of-the-art all necessary facilities for kidney patients. The project is expected to complete within 24 months and accordingly, in July 2020, the construction work of the project is to be completed.
Another significant project to serve the agriculture sector and the farmers requirements are the new Agricultural Economic Centre, which is being built at a cost of Rs. 50.2 million under the assistance of the Chinese Government.
Pibidena Polonnaruwa
The education sector gets huge benefits from new school buildings to science laboratories, information technology facilities, playgrounds and auditoriums. A Trilingual Learning Centre will be the icing on the cake of Polonnaruwa field of education.
Furthermore, the largest and high technology Museum in the country is being constructed in Polonnaruwa.
The Pibidena Polonnaruwa District Development Project has implemented projects covering the areas including roads, electricity, agriculture, education, health and environment will be developed comprehensively and already over 100 projects have been completed and vested in the public and another 170 projects will be vested in the public next month. They include school development, religious places development, development of school buildings, laboratories, libraries, cultural units, conference halls, teachers quarters, offices of the Principals and Deputy Principals, playgrounds and construction of building complex.
One such project is the construction of 18 classroom buildings at the Al-Ameen Muslim College, Senapura with the assistance of the security forces. Other projects include state-of-the-art conference hall facilities for all the National Schools in Polonnaruwa, development of rural dispensaries, hospital wards, reconstruction of old wards, Surgery Units, Dental Care Units, Kidney Clinic, and, doctors quarters, construction of Bhikkhu Hostels, Piriven building, Dhamma School buildings, Dharmashala, Dana Shala, development of 17 religious places irrespective of religious differences, drinking water projects, housing projects, 150 town development projects, including Hingurakgoda Trade Complex and new bus halt, and theatres.

From crisis to sustenance  Part 36
Review your product promotion strategy to check whether it needs a facelift
Imagine you are an organization trying to expand. You have carefully planned how your business will enter the new market, have developed the right product or service and believe you can offer it for a price that will be profitable. However, until you actual get to the real action and start selling your product, you need to take care of one important part of your business without which your business would not actually function, namely, your customers.
In the process of creating the marketing plan, managers usually use the 4ps model (which can also be found as the 5ps model). The 4Ps model includes price, place, product and promotion (later on the model developed in order to also include people). So, you have set the price, you have the product and the place where you want to sell it, but what about promotion
How an organization chooses to promote their products and services can have a direct and substantial impact on sales. There is much thought and consideration that needs to go into how dollars spent on advertising and promotions will convert into revenue for the company.
Therefore, once you have reached this step in your business plan you have to start building your promotional mix. The basic purpose of the promotional mix is first of all to create brand awareness but the most essential is to produce organizational goals and profits.
Mix
A promotional mix is defined as being successful if you manage to deliver a clear,compelling message based on the fact that you chose the most appropriate promotion method.The modern promotional mix generally involves five components: (1) Personal selling, (2) Advertising, (3) Direct marketing, (4) Sales promotions, (5) Public relations
While establishing your own promotional mix, you need to consider and decide upon several factors:
(1) Determine which is your target market  in terms of which customers needs you are going to fulfil through your products while understanding the attitudes and behaviours of your targeted customers;
(2) Determine your objective  more precisely, what are you expecting to get one your promotion mix is implemented.
(3) Design your message in terms of content and format.
(4) Select your promotional channels.
(5) Determine your budget.
(6) Sometime after implanting the program (one week or one month) measure the results of the program and make the adjustments if needed.
In order to succeed with your promotional mix, it would be a good idea to take a look at what your competitors are doing. This does not imply that you copy them as it will not help you at all since each company has its own identity. Monitoring their ads, promotions and special events might provide you with a guide of how to promote yourself and differentiate yourself through the promotional mix.
Objectives of promotion
Today, many consumers do not buy things just for their functional qualities. Even making sure the product is conveniently available, appropriately priced and of good quality is no longer enough. Marketers need to add psychological value to their products. Discerning and affluent customers need this value to manifest their inner needs. This is where the concept of product promotion comes into play.
The objectives of product promotion are not only to increase sales and attract customers but also to improve product recognition and enhance brand identity. Product promotion benefits businesses by generating consumer demand, and benefits consumers by providing needed information about product availability and uses.
You should be thinking about how to promote your product a long time before you start producing (or marketing) it. Your visits to retailers and distributors and interviews with them will give you an opportunity to find out what sort of promotion your potential competitors are doing and what sort of promotion you could organize with your network.
Types
Product promotion covers a range of activities. Few examples of techniques that are used around the world include the following:
Advertising: This can be on radio or television, in newspapers or magazines, on posters and billboards, or by using leaflets handed out in the street or delivered to homes.
Point-of-Sale displays: These are special displays of a product or range of products inside a shop.
Free samples: This technique is particularly useful for new products and have to be done in conjunction with a good point-of-sale display.
Word-of-Mouth: You organize parties and gatherings at convenient locations, in order to educate the participants of your products. If people like them they will buy, in turn, tell their friends about them.
Coupons: You can include coupons on product packaging. These can be used by consumers to get a reduced price on their next purchase. Coupons can also be included on leaflets.
Tokens: Another technique is to include a small token on each packet or container. When people collect a specified number of tokens they can return them to the manufacturer to receive a gift.
Special prices: Reducing prices can be used as a short-term promotional technique. Price reductions have to be used together with other promotional techniques, such as advertising, and in-store displays.
These are just few examples of promotion to consumers. The breadth of product promotion activities is limited only by creativity. To mount an effective product promotion campaign, however, you must be aware of customer psychology and buying patterns as well as the nature and extent of your competition.
Push strategies
A Push promotional strategy is designed to market the product to resellers, such as wholesalers and retailers, to convince them to buy and provide shelf space to advertise it. Perhaps the best way of doing this is to convince them that your promotion activities for consumers will result in very good sales, so they will make money by selling your products. Free samples can also be used to attract the interest of shopkeepers in stocking your products. Gifts, such as pens or key rings, with the name and logo of your company on them can also be used.
Pull strategies
A Pull strategy targets the end user. This strategy is used when retailers are reluctant to carry the product for some reason -- the product may be too expensive to sell at retail outlets, for example. Pull strategies include public promotional events such as contests, door-to-door sales, point-of-sale displays, Internet marketing campaigns and telemarketing campaigns.
Hybrid strategies
Hybrid promotion strategies incorporate both push and pull elements. One type of hybrid strategy involves simultaneous initiatives to both resellers and end users. Another type involves partnering with retailers to help them sell the product, often partly at the manufacturers or wholesalers expense. Network marketing is a particularly innovative hybrid strategy because it recruits people who function as both resellers and end users at the same time.
Tips
Here are some tips to keep in mind when you need to implement a program of product promotion.
Brand message
Your brand message needs to match your product, and the way you show that product to the world. For instance, if your brand message is high quality, then dont show poor quality snapshots of your product.
Product images
Your product images are one of the most important parts of promoting your business. Take time to think about the kinds of images that will match your brand and find photographers or resources that will allow you to get those images. Be sure your images match your brand message!
Product descriptions
Product descriptions can be a tricky thing to write, people either have not enough information or they have way too many descriptors. Be clear, be simple and just say exactly what you need people to know. Be sure your descriptions fit with your brand message!
Pricing & packages
We are often tempted to price things low as a way to get customers. But it is very important that you do not sell on price. Affordable or cheap should not be your brand message. If that is the only reason people are buying your thing, no one will stick around when someone else comes along and undercuts your prices.
Delivery
There are a lot of choices when it comes to how we market our products; with a number of print options as well as online options like websites, blogs, e-newsletters, Facebook pages, Flickr etc. Determine where your ideal clients will be most likely to look for information on your products and focus on a few marketing strategies that will match your brand message.
Stand out
If all of your competitors post flyers at the local super markets, hand out tri-fold brochures and have a Facebook page, do something different to promote your business. Create a gorgeous online magazine, hand out mini-cards with different product images on each or display a stunning canvas collage of your products at a trendy caf.
Be consistent nothing dilutes a brand message or makes you look more unprofessional than inconsistency. Whether you are promoting your products online or in print be consistent with how you show your product  image styles, image sizes, image borders, font styles, font sizes, background colours, additional design elements, watermarks these are all places where consistency will make your promotional materials look professional.
Branding
Not only do your promotional materials and strategies need to match your brand message but you should also use this as an opportunity to display the look of your brand as well. Use the colours, fonts & designs of your branding in both your online and print promotional materials. Use your logo to watermark your product images, and your brand colour as a border for the images. The more consistent you are the more brand recognition you achieve.
Deal with objections
All customers have objections running through their mind no matter what the purchase. Consider ahead of time what those objections could be and use your promotional methods to deal with them. Use your images, descriptions & pricing to head off objections as well as being clear about warrantees, return policies, care & maintenance etc. When executed properly a product promotion strategy can be hugely successful and very rewarding. So, dont rush into it, consider your options and find the perfect combination.

Rs. 76 mn administration complex for Matara nurses school
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne opened the new administrative building complex of the Matara Nurses Training School built at a cost of Rs. 76 million recently, a Health Ministry spokesperson said.
According to the spokesperson, after opening the building, Minister Senaratne said all state hospitals will be developed to the standards of hospitals in Europe.
The free health service in Sri Lanka, especially the primary healthcare service is praised by the entire world, he said. Minister Senaratne also said unfortunately today, the media does not report on the progress made and the benefits received by the people due to various policy decisions made in the health sector.
However, in foreign countries, 90 percent of media reports are about development and only 10 percent criticism.
Some do not like the programme to provide free eye lenses for patients and they want the old system which can be used to earn a lot of money, he added.

Saintly figures  from Polonnaruwa
Sabtha Swaras in Indian classical music means seven Swaras. Similarly, Sabtha Lokhas means seven worlds. Sabtha Thandava of Lord Siva is depicted in seven different Thandavas. In Hinduism, the seven Rishis are called Sabtha Rishis. These Sabtha Rishis could be still seen among the stars. Similarly, in Hinduism, the seventh day after the full moon day and seventh day after the dark full moon day are called Sabthami.
Sabtham in Bharatha Natyam item based on seven counts in the thala scale. It is based on Misrachaapu thala. Basically, Misrachaaputhala is founded on seven thala counts. Due to that, the dance item based on seven thala counts in the classical Bharatha Natyam repertoire is generally referred to as Sabtham.
Stone slabs
During the Polonnaruwa period, in Sri Lanka, the seven Maathas (seven mothers) figures were carved in three different stone slabs. All these different seven Maathas are collectively called Sabtha Maathas. Today these excellent ancient carved figures are seen at the National Museum of Colombo under the title of Sabtha Maathas. The same category of Sabtha Maathas (seven mothers) sculptural friezes is also seen at the Indian archaeological sites and numerous Sivan temples in South India.
The Polonnaruwa period Sabtha Maatha stone friezes were discovered from the ruins of the 5th Sivan temple of Polonnaruwa. All the Sabtha Maatha figures are based on Hinduism and depicted with four arms. They are depicted in a seated position.
According to Hindu mythology, the seven Maathas are named Brahmi, Maheswari, Vaishnavi, Varaahi, Kaumaari Indraani and Chaamundi. According to certain Hindu legends Goddess Brahmi originated from Lord Brahma, Goddess Vaishnavi Maatha originated from Lord Vishnu and Goddrss Maheswari originated from Lord Siva. Another Hindu legend states, that the Goddess Brahmi is the consort of Lord Brahma (the God of creation).
Four faces
In Tamil, Lord Brahma is often referred to as Naanmuhan, because it reveals that Lord Brahma is always depicted with four faces. Naanmuhan means the God with four faces. Among these Sabtha Maatha stone friezes, Goddess Brahmi is depicted with three faces. The cause must be that the sculptor who carved this figure was not in a position to carve the fourth face. It is assumed that the backside of the image is blocked and covered with the stone slab. This must be one of the causes that the Goddess Brahmi figure was carved with three faces. The symbols depicted in the hands are not clearly or easily seen.
According to Hinduism, Lord Vishnu is the God of protection and his consort is Goddess Vaishnavi. Lord Siva is often referred to as Lord Maheswaran. Lord Siva is the God of destruction. Goddess Maheswari is considered as the consort of Lord Maheswaran. Among the Sabtha Maatha stone frizzes, the carved figure of Goddess Maheswari is unique in nature. The head of this figure is adorned with a crafted headgear. Except for Goddess Maheswari, all other figures are seen wearing plain head gears. Goddess Maheswaris lower right arm is holding Thirichul, the upper right arm is holding Udukku (Uddeki or Damaru), and the down left hand is resting on the thigh. The left upper hand is holding Paasa cord which symbolizes worldly illusions, desires and attachment. The costume patterns and ornamental decorations are not seen clearly.
Among the other seven Maathas, Kaumarai is said to have been originated from Lord Skanda. Varaahi is another Maatha among the group of Sabtha Maathas. Varaahiis assumed as the consort of Varaaha incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Among the ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu, in the Varaaha Avathara, Lord Vishnu appeared with a boar face and protected the earth from destruction. Goddess Varaahi is also depicted with boar face.
Divine origins
Indran's consort Indrani is also considered as one of the seven Maathas. Chaamundi is considered as one of the divine origins of the Sabtha Maathas.
These three stone friezes belong to the in-between the period of 10th to 13th century A.D. All the Sabtha Maathas figures are carved on a horizontal level with the same size.
There are no differences in the sizes of the seven figures. The word hastha in Sanskrit means hand gesture.
Silpa Sastra describes 32 varieties of sculptural hastas (hands). Yet Abaya hastha, Varadahastha and Vitarka hastha are commonly seen in these seven carved figures. Abaya Hastha depicts the protection hand, Varadahastha depicts the blessings hands (facing the palm down) and Vitarkahastha depicts the preaching hand. The Sri Lankan Archaeological carved Sabtha Matha figures are unique in nature and closely linked to the Sabtha Maatha carved figures of contemporary Chola period of India.

Sanga counters political googly with a straight bat
Cricket legend Kumar Sangakkara who retired from international cricket three years ago has been in the news for the wrong reasons.
The name of the former captain and iconic player has been doing the rounds especially in political circles that he is going to enter local politics.
Some have even spoken about Sangakkara becoming a candidate for the next Presidential elections in 2020.
Last week, Cabinet spokesman Minister Rajitha Senaratne told that they would support Sangakkara if he enters politics.
But Sangakkara who has put to the sword some of the greatest bowlers in the world during his illustrious career countered such offers as he had done as a cricketer  with a broad bat.
He is reported by the Cricket Age website to have denied all the rumours and gossip of entering politics putting an end to such speculations.
As a cricketer Sangakkara has gained many adulations and accolades and is a highly respected figure in international cricket circles and it would be a tragedy if he is to enter politics and tarnish the good name that he has earned over the years.
Politics they say is a dirty game and it is not a place for a gentleman cricketer like Sangakkara. One does not have to look all that far but listen to the debates that take place in parliament and the language used by some of the politicians to come to a conclusion to what drastic levels the quality of parliament standards have dropped.
Sangakkara will be better off serving the game at international level where he has a large following on social media as well as wherever he presents himself where he is adored and respected.
Sri Lanka should be honoured that he is part of the Sky cricket commentary team for Englands summer of cricket that featured Pakistan and Australia and currently India alongside such cricket luminaries as Sir Ian Botham, Nasser Hussain, Michael Atherton, David Gower, David Bumble Lloyd, Michael Holding, Ricky Ponting and Wasim Akram.
Sangakkara is held in high esteem for his moving and forthright speech on the machinations of how Sri Lankas cricket administration is run which he delivered at the MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture 2011 at Lords after which he became the first man to get a standing ovation since Desmond Tutu in 2008. His criticism of how sport is run in the country were startling frank and brave. It is needless to say that he will be wasting this God given talent if he chooses to enter Parliament, which one hopes not.
The good name of a cricketer should not be tarnished for all the countrys ills. The politicians who are responsible for pushing the country to its current state of affairs should find ways and means to extricate it from the mess rather than try to deviate from the real problem at hand.
CRICKETER, POLITICIAN AND NOW PM
On a different plateau we find another iconic cricketer who led his country to win the World Cup in 1992 and turned to politics after retiring from the game, is now a bats swing away from becoming his countrys Prime Minister.
Imran Khan was a born leader and like Sangakkara came from a respectable family. He received the education that many Pakistanis would have been envious of - being educated at Aitchison College, Lahore considered the Pakistani equivalent of Eton before being sent to England to study at the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe, and then to Oxford to read philosophy, politics and economics. After he graduated he returned to Pakistan and later captained his country at cricket.
In 1996 the year Sri Lanka won the World Cup, Imran formed his own political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (Pakistan Movement for Justice) and since has remained a popular political figure. At the recently concluded Pakistan elections Imrans PTI emerged as the single largest party in the National Assembly but still short of numbers to form the government on its own. Imran has stated that he is confident of forming the government with the help of other minority parties which would lead the way to him being named the countrys 19th Prime Minister.
Sri Lanka already has another World Cup winning captain in its midst in Parliament  Arjuna Ranatunga. Whether he will harbour any thoughts of one day following in Imrans footsteps remains to be seen.

Sketches worth reading
The literary genre known as the short story has come a long way from its genesis of being a mere anecdote, parable and a tale. The two literary scholars Albert K Ridout and Jesse Stuart have compiled 25 short stories of varying forms and contents titled as Short Stories For Discussion (Charles Scribners Sons, 1965, 1968). The central intention is to create an awareness of the genre, short story in order to perceive the various aspects it covers over the years of development.
The intention is fulfilled not only in the very selection but also in the introductory notes directed towards the human experiences, the length of the narrative, the intention of the expression or the theme, the structure f the narrative, the use of the dialogue and monologue, characterisation, the story setting and other dimensions linked to the cultural and religious background.
Creative communication
In order to help the student reader of these short stories, the compilers have presented a series of questions at the end of each story. This helps a classroom discussion and/or a creative seminar session on creative communication.
Take for instance the opening short story by Sherwood Anderson (1876  1941) titled Egg. The narrator or the persona in the story is a young boy, presumably a teenager, who observes how his father and mother runs a restaurant, where the father is the owner and the mother the helping handling all matters. The father who is an expert in egg matters with emphasis on poultry happens to encounter a strange customer with whom he faces a dispute. But the event gets settled.
The observation linked to an egg makes the teenager concentrates more an egg matters, there he wondering himself:
He stood the egg on the counter and it fell on its side. He tried the track again and again, each time rolling the egg between the palms of his hands and saying the words regarding the wonders of electricity and the laws of gravity. When after a half hours effort he did succeed in making the egg stand for a moment he looked up to find that his visitor was no longer watching.
Better lifestyle
The reader is taken on a journey from reality to fantasy through the peephole vision of a young boy. The story Egg enveloped more human experiences than it is expressed on the surface layer of the narrative. IT expressed the efforts made on the part of a father and a mother to lead a better lifestyle with what then can be within their living frame.
The compilers state that because the short story as it is accepted is an important form of writing, it is helpful short story is and how it differs from non-fiction such as the essay or the article as well as from other fiction such as the novel. In this direction, an attempt is made by way of examples to show how it could be perceived with the idea oneness of impression. This impression is attained by developing a single incident in one locale with a small group of characters and covering a single, relatively short span of time. It is also stated to qualify a short story it must also be fictitious and not be exact-description of an actual happening. But in todays discourse how many writers are likely of agreeing on the matter.
Most writers today claim the truth is stranger than fiction. Most writers believe that some of their best stories have sprung up from real day to day events. As such, the short story writers around the globe possess a certain degree of unity in diversity. Some of the best short stories that created a bliss and wisdom to readers around the globe have been included for discussion.
Embedded experience
One good example is Katherine Mansfields (1888  1923) The Garden Party. In this story as pointed out by the compilers a reader will note that the central experience is embedded is directed to the sympathy for man and his living conditions and a precision in choice of words and phrases. An entirely different form of short story is by the wellk nwon American writer Ernest Hemingway (1808  1961) In Another Country. It is a study in mans struggle to lead a health life. But how possible is it in actual reality. The characters of doctors in a particular hospital and the galaxy of patients who come to get treatment from them are presented in the form of a clinical study. But it is also a study in individuals where living and dying matter above anything else. It is said that in the present context of living most people read short stories rapidly reading in order to know the story form or the plot. But the two compilers have presented an action plan for a reader to gauge the intensity to read in such manner could yield better results in the very act of reading. Reading short stories or even any other form of narrative ought to be a disciplined action that requires guidance.
Such a guidance is provided in the compilation. In addition to being one of the compilers, Jesse Steuar presents himself not only as a practising short story writer but also as a rereader of how he writes in his essay titled How I write my short stories. He underlines several significant factors enabling the reader to imagine the several alyers in the creative communication patterns. One points as he lays, goes as follows:
Often when you read a story and look atht eprinted page, you feel that something wonderful has been created it is an art to be able to make the characters in a story seem like real people to the reader. Furthermore, it takes a skilled author to make a fictional story seem to be true. As you read such a story your mind eagerly follows the pictures his words have painted.
The short stories by Joseph Conrad (1857  1924) titled as The Tale and The Bride Comes Yellow Sky by Stephen Crane (1871  1900) are two good examples that depict the transcending nature of the mere story pattern into matured outlook into narrative forms and structure.
All in all, this work presently a tribute to all the story lovers around the world is also a repository of creative pieces of varying types. A discourse on these narratives may help build a better learning and teaching culture in creativity.

SLIA concludes Architects Regional Exhibition in Matara
Sri Lanka Institute of Architects (SLIA) held its regional exhibition for the year 2018 at Old Dutch Market in Nupe, Matara from July 28 to 30, 2018. The event was opened to public from 9.00 am to 7.00 pm on all three days.
As the first destination from Down South, the event was inaugurated by the chief guest Mangala Samaraweera, Minister of Finance and Mass Media. Sri Lanka Institute of Architects planned these Regional events to take Architecture to the regions as a matter of equal importance to the rapid development taking place in Colombo.
The event was a great success due to the dedication of the SLIA President Archt. D. H. Wijewardene FIA (SL), exhibition committee chairman and SLIA Vice President Archt. Russell Dandeniya FIA (SL) and all other members of the SLIA.
Matara is a significant city which is well known for its architectural heritage, having been ruled by the Portuguese in the 16th Century and by the Dutch in 18th Century.
These two colonials have left behind edifices of their heritage and culture and we are privileged to have them even to this day. The venue of the event, the Nupe Dutch Market, is steeped in history for its architectural value.
With the presence of such important Architectural monuments it is apt that SLIA chose Matara to showcase the works of its members and to exhibit Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects carried out by the SLIA. The SLIA erected 100 vertical flags in strategic locations in the Matara Town while posters and leaflets carrying exhibition information were distributed to make people aware of the event during these three days.
The general public, government officials, university students, senior school children, employees of state and financial institutions and entrepreneurs of the Southern Province were present for the exhibition.
SLIA conducted similar successful exhibitions in the past in Ratnapura, Galle, Negombo, Kandy and Jaffna and this was another outstanding addition to that list. As an added feature, an Architectural Clinic was made available at the exhibition for the general public to discuss and offer advices on their architecture- related problems.
The SLIA thanked Udaya Abeygunasekera, proprietor of Udaya Constructions (Pvt) Ltd for the support extended to make the event a great success and Architect Dr. Senaka Dharmatilleke for educating the public on Revival of Colonial Urban Heritage in Matara.

Snake charmer!
When she was 14, Zee saw a snake in a pet shop that she just had to buy so she split the cost with her brother and bought it home.
Now training to be a veterinary nurse, the 21-year-old owns 16 snakes who live in her bedroom. Among her trove of reptiles, her favourites are a majestic 16-foot Burmese python, a boa constrictor, royal python, and a blood python.
Though shes been bitten countless times, she doesnt think her beloved pets will ever act aggressively towards her.
I have been bitten almost every week, she said.
It depends on the bite and the severity of it. With a feeding bite, for example, alcohol is the best way of getting a snake off you if theyre not letting go, or putting their heads underwater. If its a small snake, just wait. Theyre going to let go of it at some point. When its a touch and release, I like to call them love taps, I just clean off the wound and get on with whatever Im doing. Snakes are not out to kill you; they arent out to get you. They do tend to be extremely nervous animals, she added. My favourite animal would be my big girl, Scarlet, my Burmese python. Shes my absolute pride and joy. I actually struggle to pick her up by myself so its usually a two-man job to deal with her.
Zee often lets out the larger snakes onto the hallway where they can slither as they please.
Theyve even managed to get into the walls and under the floorboards in the flat, resulting in a few visits from the fire brigade to help get them out again.
Zees Burmese pythons are fed once a month on extra large rabbits, roughly three to six kilograms, while the smaller ones are fed on a diet of rodents or chicks.
Theyre very, very attractive animals in my opinion. Theyre sweethearts, theyre so docile that they would never bite me out of aggression, added Zee.
They would hiss at me, they would do their little belly flop, they would let me know that they want to be alone. But thats the worse they would do and I dont mind that at all. Whats not to love They are absolutely fascinating animals and I learn something new about them every single day.

Sri Lankan visa scam in NZ revealed
Hundreds of students from Sri Lanka could be in New Zealand illegally, while officials do what they can to investigate claims of a major scam involving student visa applications from Sri Lanka.
The New Zealand immigration office in Mumbai that handles Sri Lankan applications received a tip off at the start of the year.
Inquiries led officials to conclude a Sri Lankan based finance company was fraudulently creating documentation to help students meet the criteria of having $15,000 in the bank.
Official briefings to Immigration Minister Iain Lees-Galloway show investigations are under way into the potential involvement of education agents in Sri Lanka, the finance company, whose name is redacted in the papers, and students as a result of these revelations.
There were 88 pending applications when the fraud was discovered and after further checks were done, 83 were declined. The tip-off was in January. Immigration Minister Iain-Lees Galloway said officials did not yet know how many fraudulent applications may have slipped through the net.
There could potentially be hundreds of students here illegally, Lees-Galloway said.
"So what Immigration New Zealand is doing is identifying the ones that have the potential to be fraudulent and I think are taking sensible action."
He said officials were somewhat hamstrung in their ability to establish the authenticity of thousands of past applications.
They were going through 895 applications that came from Sri Lanka through the Mumbai office, to identify which ones contained information from the "fraudulent" finance company, the minister said.
"They would place a flag against those applications, those people still in New Zealand, in the event that they try to extend their visa and stay in New Zealand longer, closer scrutiny would be applied to those applications."
The New Zealand government would not, however, be challenging any visas other than the original 88 when the fraud was discovered, Lees-Galloway said.
"The challenge that Immigration New Zealand faces with trying to do this retrospectively is they rely on the finance company to provide the bona fide information when they're assessing an application," he said.
"Given this finance company has proved to be fraudulent, it's a pointless exercise for Immigration New Zealand to go back to them and ask them to verify the information that they gave in the first place."
Immigration New Zealand no longer dealt with that company, he said.
Acting Prime Minister Winston Peters said he and the New Zealand public expected the immigration system to be robust, and for the minister and officials to uphold those expectations.
But he accepted there could be significant numbers involved in this scam.
"I've no doubt that is possible, but our job is to make sure it stops and we tidy up the processes."
Meanwhile, the National Party wants to know why hundreds of past visas that have been granted to Sri Lankan students won't be reviewed.
The papers said a number of New Zealand educational providers had been affected and they had been told about what had happened and warned about the impact of student numbers in the future.
There was also an allegation "students paid an additional fee to secure the documentation" which was under further investigation.
From 2015 to 2017, there were about 5,000 student visa applications from Sri Lanka of which about 3,800 were approved. The documents do not make it clear how long officials think the scam has been going on.
Former Immigration Minister and National Party spokesperson Michael Woodhouse asked Lees-Galloway whether he would look at past years to make sure the visas approved were legitimate.
Lees-Galloway said that after scrutinising, then rejecting, many of the 88 applications, the focus would now be on any future signs of fraud.
"To identify applications with similar characteristics already decided by INZ would require substantial collation which I do not believe is in the public interest."
According to Woodhouse, up to half of Sri Lankan applicants could have used the company "fraudulently". He said that should be enough for officials to find how widespread any fraud was.
They were arriving in New Zealand ripe for exploitation as they had no money to support themselves, he said.
"I'm concerned that they are perpetrators but also potential victims."
It was "extraordinary" that the minister admitted no work had been done to review past applications. "Of course it's in the public interest to make sure our visa system has integrity," he said.

Strive for positivity
Head Girl of St. Pauls Girls School, Milagiriya Kethani Hettiarachchi has a pragmatic approach to life. Perfect Prefects features Hettiarachchi who thinks hard before committing herself to anything and believes in loving oneself.
Thinking hard and as hard as possible has brought her positive results. Too often we have seen the young come to grief because they simply do not think hard. Thinking hard is behind most situations in life. Thinking is the main idea here.
One problem I see is that the youth are getting distracted, even getting into drugs. They need to focus on their studies when they are students. They need to appreciate what their parents are doing for them. They have a duty towards their parents. Before committing yourself to something you need to think deep and hard. If you do something and if you do it well then you can succeed. I also feel that you should love yourself and be true to yourself. Do not live to please anyone. Control your life and dont give others a reason to control your life. Our generation can make a difference in this world, said Hettiarachchi.
Beyond control
Hettiarachchi has both feet on the ground and is level-headed. Tomorrow will bring its own troubles she says.
My secret to success as a Head Girl is that I live in the present and I do not trouble my head about things beyond my control or things that may occur in the future. I will deal with the problems when and if it happens. If I can bring happiness to my parents then I am satisfied. I have no huge targets in my life, I am content and I will do things step by step and not think too deeply about anything, stated Hettiarachchi.
There is an old biblical saying  Remove the log in your eye before trying to take a speck out of your brothers eye.
In the societies we live in, there is so much recrimination going around without any positivity at all. There is so much arguing and quarrelling between people. I think first of all we must focus on our own characters and be the change we want to see in this world and work for the improvement of our country. If you can develop your character without constantly finding fault with others, I think that would be in the best interests of everyone. That would make a far better society, pointed out Hettiarachchi.
Hettiarachchi is never alone. She has a huge support system. She never feels abandoned, always having help. Her Principal, parents and friends are there for her. With their guidance, they are the wind beneath her wings.
Role model
In my life, I must say that my biggest role model is my loving mother and at school, my biggest role model is my Principal. My parents are there for me whenever I need to talk to them. So I feel no such great pressure. At the morning assemblies, our Principal provides wonderful guidance and advice. She inspires us by talking about the lives of great and noble leaders like Nelson Mandela and encourages us to read up on them and learn from them. We are fortunate to be led by a person such as our principal, who truly cares about us and who gives our well-being top priority. She is one of the most committed people I know. I am very proud to be a student at St. Pauls Milagiriya, it is a school that provides its students with a holistic education and a school that has nurtured students, enabling them to achieve many milestones. The students are educated and have excelled in many spheres such as the academic sphere, added Hettiarachchi.
Obama and the Queen of England have a certain charisma that endears them to so many.
I admire Barack Obama a lot because he had to face a lot of criticism from many people but I think he achieved something significant. I also admire the Queen of England because she is able to get along with anyone, said Hettiarachchi.
Hettiarachchi would like to be remembered as someone who touched the lives of those who she came into contact with.
It would be nice if I could be remembered as someone who did something positive and leave behind something because my badge is not forever. If I can see a tear in my parents eyes when people speak good of me, then I feel that I have done well. I would like to be known as a person who had good qualities, explained Hettiarachchi.
Horrific stories
Hettiarachchi feels that it is sad that there is so much mindless violence in society.
Today we see many horrific stories on the news. We see so many tragedies. It is a constant repetition of tragedy every day. It has come to a point where it is unwatchable with stories of rape and murder. We cannot be proud of what we see on TV. Because during my younger days the news was all about the Civil War. So there is not much of a difference but it is something that needs to be addressed. We need to see a positive difference in society. We need to strive towards that, said Hettiarachchi.
However, in the midst of all this sadness, there are times of great joy and pride.
When we won the World Cup in 1996, our Sri Lankan Cricketers made me very proud and to this day I remember that. I remember the euphoria very well and the passion that went with it. I also love music because it is a global language and who doesnt love music It is appreciated by people in all cultures, all backgrounds and all walks of life and music unites us all, explained Hettiarachchi.

## Title: TOWARDS A TOTAL WILDLIFE EXPERIENCE

TOWARDS A TOTAL WILDLIFE EXPERIENCE
In recent years the reputation of the National Parks of Sri Lanka, especially that of the Yala National Park (Block I), has been severely dented, both locally and internationally, due to the uncontrolled and undisciplined behaviour of the jeep drivers and guides who take visitors into the Parks. At times, such has been their behaviour that they have not only endangered the lives of their passengers but, in several instances, wild animals have been killed too. Such practice not only drives visitors, especially tourists, from returning but they also take with them a very negative image of the National Parks, and also of the country; a disillusionment that is conveyed to their kith and kin on return to their country of origin.
Changing a mindset
A major reason for this mayhem at Yala, and increasingly elsewhere is that the majority of visitors, particularly the local ones, are only interested in sightings or en route to elsewhere and visit a National Park as a stop off either on the way to, or back from, their main destination. They, too, are in search of a sighting in the limited time they have to whizz through the park. The preferred sightings are almost always of elephant, leopard and bear, with scant notice paid to the other creatures of the Park. Kudos is earned not in the quality of the sighting but in their quantity, with each trying to outdo the other in the number of leopard or bear they can boast of having spotted. Then there are also those who when finding a place of vantage will not give it up, sometimes for hours on end, with others chaotically jostling for position to try and catch a glimpse of the quarry.
As per available statistics, one third (1/3rd) of all tourists to Sri Lanka visit the National Parks, attracted by their rich biodiversity, and as promoted in all of the leading tourism websites. An added attraction is that Sri Lanka, Yala and Wilpattu in particular, are famed for hosting leopards that have no fear of being seen during the day, where elsewhere in the world, they are predominantly nocturnal. Uda Walawe is one place that the sight of a wild elephant can be guaranteed at any hour, on any day of the week, while The Gathering, at Minneriya, is now an international natural wonder for those who love to see elephants in numbers.
An economic bounty for local communities
As per a published study conducted by the Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO), in 2016 along the Yala National Park (Block I) attracted an income of approximately Rs. 7.5 Billion, the majority of which was earned by stakeholders of the region other than the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC). It has also been estimated that visitors to the Minneriya National Park, during the few months of its annual Gathering, contribute Rs. 1.25 Billion per year to the national economy. With the increasing popularity of the other National Parks, each has the potential to attract similar large revenue for local businesses and entrepreneurs, as well as foreign exchange for the country.
For this prosperity to be sustained into the future, however, not only is it important to preserve the integrity of the National Parks and that of their incredibly rich biodiversity, but also to ensure that they become places that visitors, particularly those from overseas, would want to visit again and again, and recommend to their friends and family as a preferred destination for viewing wildlife.
Bringing order through information
With this in mind, and with the active collaboration of the DWC, the Federation of Environmental Organizations (FEO) has, with the assistance of noted conservationists and environmental experts, compiled a Nature Interpretation Programme specifically aimed at educating jeep drivers and tourist guides not only on the natural wonders of the fauna and flora of the National Park which is the source of their livelihoods, and of explaining their beauty and intricacies of behaviour to their customers, but also on maintaining Park discipline, as well as in etiquette and personal presentation.
Each programme will be specifically catered to address the National Park at which it is being conducted, and the presenters will be chosen accordingly. In addition, all participants will receive a Certificate of Participation endorsed by both FEO and SLAITO.
A successful first
The first of these programmes was launched at the Wilpattu National Park under the scrutiny of the Deputy Director of the DWC (Planning, ICT and Law Enforcement), Ranjan Marasinghe, and of Chandani Wilson, Deputy Director of Visitor Services. In total, 45 jeep drivers and guides actively participated in the programme, which was held over two (2) days. Thanks are due to the Jeep Drivers Associations of Wilpattu who readily accepted the necessity for such a training and encouraged their members to attend.
While it is easy for everyone to blame the jeep drivers for the anarchy in the Parks, no real effort has been made to give them the necessary knowledge and understanding of what is expected of them to become responsible guardians of the natural wonder into which they take visitors, and whose preservation is vital for their personal financial prosperity.
Neither have they been given any training as to how to interpret the nature around them, from the smallest to the largest, in ways that make each observation of special interest to the visitor. Most importantly, this was the first time that a senior officer of the DWC and the Warden of the National Park had engaged in direct discussions with them on how to achieve the objective of giving visitors a total wildlife experience, rather than just tick off numbers of sightings of leopard, bear and elephant.
A focus on knowledge
The Deputy Directors and Warden had the backing of an expert team of presenters, from several fields, to give the participants as much information as they required to improve their driving and guiding skills. This started with an in-depth presentation on the Wilpattu National Park, its geography, history, archaeology and fauna and flora, with a special section on its leopards. There was a section on elephants and their behaviour, as well as on all of the other animals of the Park, from insects and butterflies to birds to reptiles and mammals. In addition, bringing this all together was a section on self-presentation and nature interpretation.
The presenters all had an impressive pedigree with the combined knowledge that was eagerly shared, and received, with and by the participants. They included Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya, former Director General of the DWC, Nishad Wijethunga (Committee Member of SLAITO), Kithsiri Gunawardena, Namal Kamalgoda and Rahula Perera. Each participant received a Certificate of Participation from the Federation of Environmental Organisations, as authorized by SLAITO. The cost of this programme was sponsored by SLAITO, Back of Beyond, Quickshaws, Uga, Governors Camp and Backwaters.
Further such programmes, once again in collaboration with the DWC, are being planned for the Yala, Minneriya, Kaudulla and Uda Walawe National Parks, with a further follow-up programme at Wilpattu for those who missed the first programme and have demanded another. In addition, the long-term intention is that the behaviour of drivers in the National Parks, and the quality of service they give to visitors, will be monitored by the DWC, and a graded certification given to each driver dependent on their performance.
FEO is a non-political, non-partisan organisation that provides a platform for connecting interest groups with a patriotic interest in safeguarding Sri Lankas natural heritage through conservation and advocacy.

On the  translation  landscape
My purpose here is to spotlight on aspects of Translation gleaned from an essay by the Chief Editor of Illuminati, Dr Neeru Tandon, from the latest issue. There are very few translators of creative writing in our country. Speaking of Lankan Tamil Literature, I notice there is hardly anyone that can translate a novel, for instance from Tamil to English or vice a versa.
However, there are few works translated from Sinhala to Tamil and only one or two from Tamil to Sinhala.
The reason is people highly proficient in both Sinhala and Tamil to understand the nuances of both language and their attendant nuances are absent in the country. But there are many that have been translated from other languages into Sinhala and a few from Sinhala into English. But none from Tamil to English, none from English to Tamil s far as Lankan Tamil Literature is concerned.In this context, lets see what academic, associate professor Neeru Tandon has got to say about translation in general.
Translation of literary works is a specific subdivision of literature that allocates not merely words in other language or tries to convey literary terminologies or linguistic structures conforming to the language of the original work in the language being translated into. But its major involvement and aim is to transfer aesthetic, cultural, psychological and historical perceptions and conception from one language into another.
Translation is sensitive as it has a burden to translate one culture and a particular way of living into another in order to accomplish the levels of meanings of a given text in the target language, without distorting the original beauty and spirit of the text. She reminds at the outset what Robert Pinsky has said in the article published 12 years ago in Literary Review:
Translation is the only art that is like writingIt is also the highest, most intense form of reading, yet translation is almost by definition the most imperfect of arts of more than any other form of writing risks self-delusion.
Tandon continues:
Translation gives a message that all reding is, in fact deconstructive.
One actually recreates a new text in the process of translation. A good translator reads between the lines to ascertain a new meaning and deals with the questions like:
who can translate and for whom Which text or genre to translate Who is the reader How are the readers going to accept it How should one translate How to deal with a text in translation And finally, _ Is unlearning obligatory
Answers to these questions must take care of a larger question whether we translate to construct a national, literary and cultural landscape or to patronize, appropriate, marginalize or destroy the culture and beauty of the source language.
On the business of translation, lets take some more excerpts from the same source. Here is one on Machine Translation:
Shubhangi Tandon writes:
Machine Translation, quite literally means that a machine does translation from one language to another for you. If youre a netizen of the cyber world, chances are you have used a product of Machine Translation one time or the other.
Let me say about my own experience in using the machine for translations. I am not familiar with the Tamil keyboard and neither I can type in Tamil. Even in English, I type slowly. Its a one finger exercise. So, when my F B friends chat with me in Tamil only, I reply using the English letters to substitute the Tamil letters. But this was not satisfactory. So, I sought the assistance of Google Tamil Transliteration. But that was not suitable for me, because it had a split window screen which was confusing me.
So, I looked for a more convenient apparatus in Kandupidi. I use this to translate my ideas in English into Tamil using English letters which turn into Tamil letters and form words. Since I am well versed in my mother tongue and English, the communication is just right to suit different structures and cultural observances.

Turkeys  whistled  language
The small town of Kusky, which is tucked into an isolated valley on the rainy, mountainous Black Sea coast of Turkey, looks much like the other villages in the region. Houses balance on steep hillsides beside tea fields and hazelnut orchards.
A narrow white minaret and a small domed mosque stand beside a noisy creek. Kusky is remarkable not for how it looks but for how it sounds: here, the roar of the water and the daily calls to prayer are often accompanied by loud, lilting whistles-the distinctive tones of the local language. Over the past half-century, linguists and reporters curious about what locals call ku__s dili, or bird language, have occasionally struggled up the footpaths and dirt roads that lead to Kusky. So its thousand or so residents were not all that surprised when, a few years ago, a Turkish-born German biopsychologist named Onur Gntrkn showed up and asked them to participate in a study. Whistled languages, although unusual, have been around for centuries. Herodotus described communities in Ethiopia whose residents spoke like bats, and reports of the whistled language that is still used in the Canary Islands date back more than six hundred years. Most of the forty-two examples that have been documented in recent times arose in places with steep terrain or dense forests-the Atlas Mountains, in northwestern Africa; the highlands of northern Laos, the Brazilian Amazon-where it might otherwise be hard to communicate at a distance. All are based on spoken languages: Kuskys version, for example, adapts standard Turkish syllables into piercing tones that can be heard from more than half a mile away. The phrase Do you have fresh bread, which in Turkish is Taze ekmek var mi, becomes, in bird language, six separate whistles made with the tongue, teeth, and fingers. For Gntrkn, whistled Turkish was not only a fascinating cultural oddity but also an exciting natural experiment. How, he wondered, does the brain handle a language that renders words as something like music Although neuroscientists have long understood that brain functions do not divide cleanly between the left and right hemispheres, the left hemisphere appears to play a consistently dominant role in our understanding of languageregardless of whether the language is tonal or atonal, spoken or written, signed with the hands or clicked with the tongue. The right hemisphere, meanwhile, seems to govern our understanding of pitch, melody, and rhythm. In Kusky, Gntrkn tested this cranial division of labor by recruiting thirty-one volunteers, all fluent in both spoken and whistled Turkish, to listen to pairs of different syllables played simultaneously through headphones, one in each ear. When he gave them spoken Turkish, the participants usually understood the syllable played through the right speaker, suggesting that the left hemisphere was processing the sound. When he switched to whistled Turkish, however, the participants understood both syllables in roughly equal measure, suggesting that both hemispheres played significant roles in the early stages of comprehension.
Although the technique that Gntrkn used, called dichotic listening, isnt as precise as laboratory techniques for measuring brain activity, his results, published in todays issue of Current Biology, are tantalizing. They tell us that the organization of our brain, in terms of its asymmetrical structure, is not as fixed as we assume, he told me. The way information is given to us appears to change the architecture of our brain in a radical way. He now wonders whether people whose spoken-language comprehension is damaged by a left-hemisphere stroke could learn to understand a whistled dialect, much as some people with stroke-damaged speech can communicate by singing. The opportunity to study whistled Turkish, however, is fading. In 1964, a stringer for the Times reported that children in Kusky were learning to communicate by whistling before they started school, and that both men and women regularly gossiped, argued, and even courted via whistle. Three years later, a team of visiting linguists observed that whistling was widely used in both the village and the surrounding countryside.
But Gntrkn found that few, if any, young women had learned the language, and that, although some young men were fluent whistlers, they had learned the skill as teen-agers, more out of pride than any practical need. In recent years, the town has organized a whistling contest to encourage both tourism and cultural preservation, but the bird language is rapidly disappearing from daily life. In a small town filled with nosy neighbors, texting affords a level of privacy that whistling never did.
From time to time, though, whistled Turkish still comes in handy. When the residents of Kusky call Gntrkns university office, they often reach his secretary, who speaks German. When that happens, he says, they know exactly how to make themselves understood: they just whistle.

Sri Lanka team selected for HSBC International Junior Golf :
Vinod Weerasinghe to lead Sri Lanka Squad
Sri Lanka Golf (SLG), the national body for golf in Sri Lanka together with HSBC will host for the second year running the international junior golf championship to be played among the countries in the region; Sri Lanka, Pakistan and India. Sri Lanka won the inaugural tournament played last year beating Pakistan in a cliff hanger.
This year Malaysia too have entered a two member team and it is hoped that they would send a full contingent next year to further increase the Asian participation.
This event which was created to offer a platform for our juniors to compete among the best in the Indian sub-continent and Asia, was the brainchild of the SLG Junior Sub Committee and was conceived with the singular aim of raising the standard of the sport in the country. The format structured on a hybrid version of similar international team events played worldwide such as Asia Pacific Golf Team Championship and the Ryder Cup in the USA.
Each of the countries will field a team comprising of 2 boys and 2 girls. Sri Lanka team was selected by the national golf selectors headed by captain Navin de Silva. Current Sri Lanka junior boys champion Vinod Weerasinghe of British School has been picked to lead Sri Lanka, whilst the team also comprises 18-year-old Armand Flamer Caldera of St Thomas College, Mount Lavinia who is currently ranked No.2 nationally and who has also represented Sri Lanka at the Asian Championship in Sailing.
The two girls represented the team are 16-year-old Taniya Balasuriya of Sri Jayawardenapura Girls School, Kotte and 15-year-old Kayla Perera of Ladies College. Both have considerable international exposure having participated in many overseas golf events. Preceding the international team championship an individual event will be open to current junior golfers in the country on August 1st, which is also to be played at the Royal Colombo Golf Club.
This will be based on four age groups and categories: 15-18+ years (Gold Division), 12-14+ years (Silver Division), 10 -11+ years (Bronze Division) and 9 years and under (Copper Division).
The HSBC Junior International Golf Championship is supported by several prestigious event partners.
Cinnamon Life is the hospitality partner and the will host all the international teams whilst MAS Kreeda, the Apparel partner have generously provided sportswear for the grass root programme.
IMORICH from Elephant House has come forward as the indulgence partner. In addition Olu water will support the event as the official beverage with Callaway Golf, the renowned Golf brand as the equipment sponsor.

A welcome move
The issue of ragging in state Universities has been the subject of much discussion even in the earlier days and remedies sought to redeem our seats of higher learning from this scourge. However, never has this menace assumed such serious proportions as at present, leaving even the authorities helpless and without an answer. It is only all too well known that our universities have right along been hotbeds of violence fanned by radical politics. Ragging is only one dimension of this aspect. Things though appear to be getting out of hand, with sadism being practised in the name of ragging, leaving permanent scars on the victims. Some say that social instability has found expression in inhuman forms of ragging in our universities. Whatever the cause, concrete measures are called for to arrest the decline and preserve the exalted status of the countrys seats of higher learning.
It is in this backdrop that the resolve displayed by Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe to eradicate the torture that passes off as ragging in our universities, root and branch, would be welcomed by all right thinking people, particularly those parents who have misgivings in sending their children to local universities owing to the prevailing state of affairs.
According to our front page main story yesterday, Minister Rajapakshe stated that the anti-ragging Act which was passed into law in 1998, but not fully implemented will be brought into full force to end the scourge of ragging in the universities. Addressing a media conference, the minister said that all police stations have been informed to take legal action against university students ragging freshers, under the above law. The minister said that the law was firm and unambiguous against those who engage in ragging in universities and even the bailing out of a ragging suspect does not come within the jurisdiction of a magistrate. He added that if convicted, the ragger would be sentenced to 10 years RI.
It is pertinent to ask as to why successive governments, since 1998, failed to implement the anti-ragging Act to the letter. Had they done so we could have prevented the flight of many bright students to foreign universities, which, needless to say, is a loss to the country.
Of course, it is left to be seen if the minister, unlike his predecessors, has the political will to implement the anti-ragging law to the fullest. We say this because even the former Education Minister, the late Richard Pathirana, who fathered the anti-ragging law, too made bold statements when the Bill was passed in parliament. However ragging continued unabated with even deaths being reported of victims subjected to sadistic ordeals.
Researchers on the subject of ragging are of the view that most of those bent on inflicting the most inhuman forms of ragging on their victims are products of unsettled social backgrounds and those with an inferiority complex. These are mostly rural youth who gained entry to the universities thanks to the district cut off marks. It is no accident that the bulk of these types are students in the arts stream who naturally harbour a grudge against city bred students of more affluent backgrounds. Add to this the class-distinction that is most marked in the universities and you have the ideal milieu for the type of ragging that is presently witnessed in our campuses. Hence ones social outlook, accumulated frustrations, and lack of an English knowledge, or the kaduwa, too play a significant role that have their release in the sadism one hears of in the universities. Like minister Rajapakshe observed at the media conference, ragging practiced in the universities in Sri Lanka is not found even among the tribal communities in Africa.
Ragging is also a by-product of youth unrest. Hence, every effort should be made to prepare the background to mitigate this phenomenon. Today university students are confronted with the bleak prospects for their futures. A good majority of them are not equipped to fit into the prevailing job market and would most likely add up to the ballooning unemployment figures. Hence, the whole aspect of university education should be subjected to a reappraisal by the authorities so that the vast investment made by the government on higher education will not be in vain.
Pulling the wool
Inter University Students Federation Convener Lahiru Weerasekera has challenged Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe to prove that the IUSF was politically funded to organise their protest marches, following an allegation made by the minister to that effect. He dared the minister to name the political groups sponsoring the IUSF. People of this country know how we collect money inside buses carrying tills, he said.
It was the IUSF which single handedly organised the anti-SAITM agitation, bringing together not only the medical students but also schoolchildren onto the streets. How it was able to sustain such an elaborate campaign for months, with money collected in buses, is astounding indeed. Even the JVP, at one time, had its cadres holding tills at street corners. But the entire country is aware of the luxury life led by Rohana Wijeweera.

WHERE THE IMMORTAL  MESSIAH WAS COMPOSED
I walked from Brook Street a little distance to reach the end and there in the familiar corner stood the sacred Handel House Museum, dedicated to the soul and spirit of George Frideric Handel, the great baroque composer who scored his famous scores from 1723 to 1959. Messiah, Zadok the Priest and Music of the Royal Fireworks among many other. It is a beautifully restored historic house and gives the feeling that you are among the 18th century filled with music and culture and that Handel is right there, somewhere.
It is alive with music as if it were during his time, played back to back and enhancing the atmosphere are paintings and prints of the composer and of his contemporaries as a backdrop to Handel's life in London. Every visitor makes it a point to listen to the MESSIAH that Handel himself played on his own harpsichord, the instrument that is preciously/ preserved and exhibited in a prominent place and powerfully evocative. Each and all leave the Museum breathless. So, did I though it was my third visit or maybe fourth. Each time I left, MESSIAH left behind its strain lingering in my system.
Spiritual needs
I believe the best classical music is incredibly simple but very poignant and moving; modifying his lyrical contents to suit the spiritual needs of his followers. Many a time I found his music physical, emotional and intellectual. I found his scores as the interplay between conscious and subconscious and I am not his first disciple to say so.
To me his music is an ocean; waves tossing spewing forth in harmony within the walls of the Museum and Handel riding them. One gets the feeling he is all over any time of the day no matter how busy Brook Streets is.
Inspired by an invitation to Dublin to gift one of his works to charity, Handel wrote the MESSIAN, completing it in a feverish twenty-five days to meet the occasion. It was one man's genius and musical achievement, most remarkable with a burst of creativity followed by a succession of oratorios. It showed Handel to be at the height of his powers.
Heavenly score
MESSIAH. Jesus Christ is my Messiah which makes the score extra sacred and spiritual. Scripted first, then to notes next, the heavenly score rose to heights as never known before his time. This sacred cantata (1741) includes his famous passages, 'Every valley shall be exalted', 'I know that my Redeemer liveth' and 'The trumpet shall sound'. There were many other scores that simply became spectacular. From an unpromising beginning flourished the greatest keyboard instrumentalist of the day.
And in this very room where he lived and composed his masterpieces, all of us had the feeling he was at his favourite harpsichord playing the MESSIAH.
Handel Museum is solidly held at 25, Brook Street London where he lived and scrod countless operatic masterpieces was a moving experience, especially MESSIAH and spurring one's imagination the house is perfectly enchanting and beautifully evolved to draw artistic imagination. Adjoining at No. 23, Brook Street, carefully selected manuscripts and printed scores are on display from the Handel House Collection Trust that includes Mozart's arrangement of a Handel fugue considered a tribute to one great Master to another. There is also a letter from Handel to Charles Jennens who was librettist for Messiah and other Handel works. Memoirs of The Life of The Late George Frederic Handel by John Mainwaring (1760) and annotated Jennens is also on display.
Young professionals
There is also Handel's Rehearsal and Performance Room which during opening hours regularly used for rehearsals by the student and young professionals who opt to play their kind of early music before the rush of visitors. Besides, there are popular events such as TALKING MUSIC that involve active audience participation along with FAMILY EVENTS that engage the full family in musical activities. Programmes are also arranged for school workshops as well as for school visits especially beneficial for students sitting for music examinations.
George Frideric Handel was born in 1685 in Halle and died on 14th April 17959 in London. His father was in his mid-sixties when he was born, valet to the Prince of Saxe and in no mood to allow his son to study music.
It not for his understanding mother who introduced him to the Duke and who heard the boy play the organ at a Sunday service, filled his pocket with gold coins and insisted that he was allowed to study music.
He started off as the organist at the Lutheran Church under the care of Fredrick Zachov and sprinted off to a flying musical career. He studied law for a while but knew where the call was. He was a very spiritually moved composer and one can hear the immaculate spirit found in his scores.
He was a very private person and almost obsessively secret but said to have had a violent temper. Many instances were noted where he had threatened his sopranos if they failed and to another instrumentalist that he would jump upon his harpsichord saying he was ahead devil. When he slowed, he became introvert. Once he told one of his critics that he is Beelzebub and knew he had many enemies and to their surprise, he resurrected a genre that was relatively unknown in England-the-Oratorio. These were dramatized Bible stories set to music with massive choruses and with grand orchestral writing.
The genius had arrived and no one could bypass him.
He continued to play the organ and conduct in spite of his deteriorating health and failing eyesight as people flocked to hear him.
When he died his request for a private burial was overlooked as England honoured her famous and beloved son by burying him in Westminster Abbey with over 3000 people attending. A monument erected in his memory shows him at his working table with the score of MESSIAH open at 'I KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVETH' another request he made when he was dying.

Witness speechless on inordinate tender delays for 3 years
It has come to light that there had been an inordinate delay in purchasing much needed security equipment and apparatus for the Katunayake Airport.
This disclosure was made at the Presidential Commission Investigating alleged fraud, corruption and misuse of state funds and property in SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering Services and Mihin Lanka sittings on Monday. Commission member, retired High Court Judge Piyasena Ranasinghe in particular voiced concern over this delay in purchasing much needed equipment cancelling tenders for nearly three years.
When Commission Chairman, retired Supreme Court Judge, Justice Anil Gooneratne questioned witness SriLankan Airlines Security Operations Senior Manager Lal Titus Kannangara whether this inordinate delay in the purchase of much needed security equipment was proper. He became speechless.
Cross examined by Deputy Solicitor General Shanaka Wijesinghe, the witness submitted that on August 18, 2011, the European Union had pointed out that the Katunayake Airport was desperately in need of explosives detection equipment.
Without responding to that request, the Airline had delayed the purchase of equipment by cancelling tenders for a long period. It was revealed that the tender called on December 2013 was cancelled after a few months. It was revealed their Kosala Kariyawasam who was a member of the technical evaluation committee had approved the cancellation of the tender.
The witness said that he chaired the Technical Evaluation Committee and the committee cancelled the tender citing security reasons.Tenders were called again by advertising in newspapers in October 2014 and closed on December 18, 2014.
The report of the Technical Evaluation Committee was released in January 2016. The tender was awarded to Excel Trading Company.
The witness said the supplier had been selected by the Technical Evaluation Committee before obtaining the recommendations of the finance committee.
