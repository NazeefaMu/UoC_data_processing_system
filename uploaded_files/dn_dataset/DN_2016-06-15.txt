## Title: The umpire, DRS and the ICC

The umpire, DRS and the ICC
The recently concluded Test series between Sri Lanka and England brought to light the imperfection of the Decision Review System (DRS) which has been in use for the past seven years. It is through trial and error that one can rectify and fine tune the system that is in place. So the time has come to make a few changes to the rules governing LBW especially the one dealing with Umpires Call.
What the series highlighted was the margin given to umpires call which glaringly revealed decisions where the batsmen got away scot free even though the replays showed the ball clearly hitting the stumps. As the present rule stands if it is an umpires call it is left to the sole discretion of the onfield umpire to decide on whether to change his decision or not.
In this manner there were several obvious errors to which the naked eye looked plumb out but because of the ball tracking technology and umpires call the batsman got away with it.
The consensus of opinion is that the ICC was giving too much to the umpires and the time has come for a change.
Several opinions against the umpires call have been expressed that has brought the ICC cricket committee to strongly review the present system and make recommendations to change it.
A strong case in point was the decision given in favour of England wicket-keeper batsman Jonny Bairstow in the Lords Test. Sri Lanka opted to challenge umpire S Ravi's on-field call of not out when Shaminda Eranga thudded Bairstow's back pad when he was on 56. The ball-tracking technology (Hawk-Eye) showed the umpire's call standing as the ball missed the 50 per cent mark by a millimeter, as a result of which Bairstow escaped a close shave.
Angelo Mathews and his team were left stunned when the final verdict came from the third umpire. Eventually, Bairstow went on to score a big hundred  167 not out, which put England in the driving seat.
The Bairstow incident drew strong comments from none other than former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara who tweeted, High time the ICC got rid of this umpire's call. If the ball is hitting the stumps it should be out on review, regardless of [the umpire's] decision. With the umpire's call, technology is used as an excuse for the umpire making a mistake. Technology should ensure the correct decision's made.
If the umpire wants a comfort zone, give him a margin of 20%. If anything more of the ball is hitting it, his decision can be overturned, Sangakkara added.
Twitter viewers responding to Sangakkaras comments said, Sanga is absolutely right, if ball hitting the stumps it should be given out. Suppose if umpire has given out and then England gone for review then it was out because it stays as umpire decision.
Another tweeted, This is what exactly Dhoni meant when he said that the Umpire's Call is being used to protect the Umpires and is of no benefit to the game or players!! It's just a mockery and insult to people's intelligence....
The current DRS rule suggests that 50 per cent of the ball has to hit the stumps for a batsman to be given out LBW. The remaining 50 per cent is jointly allotted to benefit of doubt to the on-field umpire's decision and the lack of foolproof technology, which can accurately track the path of a ball towards the stumps after it hits the batsman.
Sangakkaras former team mate and captain Mahela Jayawardene, who is now part of the ICCs cricket committee, revealed that a recommendation has been made to change the DRS rule for LBW.
"We sat in the cricket committee last week and we decided that the 50% rule should be reduced to 25%, so that recommendation will probably go in and it's something for the stakeholders and ICC to take up," Jayawardene told ESPN Cricinfo.
"Even the MCC rule book says if it hits any part of the wicket it should be given out, so you are going away from all that with the 50% rule."
Jayawardene added that it was unfair for teams to lose a review when an lbw decision is so close to be being overturned. Research has shown that up to 80% of umpire's calls that currently remain on-field would be given out under the adjusted procedures.
"That argument has been there for the last three or four years when captains are losing reviews so that is another reason the reduction came into play," he said. "If you take 25% out, I think the stats say that 75-80% of the umpire's calls decisions would be given out. When umpires are considering benefit of the doubt I think 25% is okay, but 50% is too much."
The issue is expected to be discussed at the ICCs annual meeting in Edinburgh later this month. If approved, the DRS rule will be reduced from 50 per cent to 25 per cent and is expected come into effect by the end of September.

Royal Turf Club commences work on new Sand Track
Swifter, higher, stronger  three words that are the very epitome of the Olympic Games, and the Royal Turf Club in Nuwara Eliya is set to make the same commitment, albeit to athletes of a different form, namely the Thoroughbred Race Horse, often described as the Ultimate Machine .
The picturesque Race Course in the town of Nuwara Eliya, now the headquarters of the Royal Turf Club , will see yet another huge step in the right direction with work starting on the construction of a new Sand Track. This will be laid out on the inside of the current Turf Track and it will be available as an exercise cum training track for horses stabled there. It will be a huge benefit in improving the fitness levels for horses and preparing them to race. The Sand Track will be designed and laid down as per international standards in keeping with the aims of the Royal Turf Club, which ensure that the equine athletes stationed will be getting swifter, higher and stronger.
A Sand Track is one of the basic essentials for training a racehorse. Getting a horse ready and fit to race involves exercising them. A Sand Track depending on the depth of the sand is more taxing on a horse and yet is easier on his legs. It helps get him fit quicker. Moreover with the number of horses increasing in Nuwara Eliya means that they will now have an additional surface to train on. This will help preserve and save the Turf Track which should ostensibly only be used to race on , said CEO of the RTC, Wayne Wood. Wood said they hope to complete the Sand Track in three months - mid September as the rains were causing a delay. The laying of the Sand Track is being handled by Mr Raman from India, a reputed Track consultant, who was responsible for laying the Hyderabad Monsoon Track and Working Track. He was also in charge of the Bangalore Race Track for 25 years and the Mysore Race Track for the last five years. The cost incurred for the Sand Track is approximately Rs 30 million for the track, while the railing will incur a further Rs 13 million.
Racing will commence again 6th August this year with the Royal Turf Club even more committed to ensuring  racing at the highest level.

England was a good learning experience  Mathews
Skipper Angelo Mathews said that three-match Test series against England which Sri Lanka lost 0-2 was a good learning experience for his young inexperienced team.
We are a young team and not much experience. The way the guys fought facing Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad in challenging conditions was good to see, said Mathews at the end of the series on Monday.
The way they batted they showed a lot of guts. It was brilliant. If we play together as a unit we can improve further. We played pretty well in the second innings in Durham. Here too we were sitting pretty and then lost a heap of wickets on day three, he said.
The third and final Test at Lords was drawn after rain interrupted play several times on the fifth and final day.
Sri Lanka chasing a target of 362 runs began the day requiring a further 330 off 98 overs with all ten second innings wickets in hand.
It was a sporting declaration by Alastair (Cook). We were going to go for it. We would rather lose a game trying to win it, said Mathews. But the weather intervened and we couldnt get enough play. It would have been an interesting chase and a result was possible either way.
The wicket was playing up and down, but still a good wicket. We had lost the series 2-0 and what more to lose. We wanted to try and win the game. That was the right way to go. The way guys batted they wanted to go for it.
Talking of the positives Sri Lanka got out of the series Mathews said there were lots of them.
The fast bowlers were extremely good. True conditions were good for them, but they had to do a good job. (Rangana) Herath was superb. He is 38 and he has backed the team with his all-round ability. He is even throwing himself all over the field. It was good to see the oldest man diving around and stopping boundaries, said Mathews.
Kusal Mendis was another huge positive for us in the series. (Dinesh) Chandimal came good in the second Test. Then Kaushal (Silva) and Dimuth (Karunaratne) gave us some good starts in this Test. All were hitting the ball pretty well and it was unfortunate that no one went onto get a big score except Chandimal. We didnt win the series, but there were a lot of positives.
With young Kusal Mendis vying for the number three slot vacated by Kumar Sangakkara with some consistent scores, the number four slot that was occupied by Mahela Jayawardene has now become an issue.
We havent decided on a number four as yet. We need to find who is best and we will give it to the person we have picked, said Mathews.
If we pick someone, we need to give him a fair opportunity. Be patient with him. We dont want to chop and change people. We need to find the best possible combination. When you identify a guy with skill and talent you need to persevere with him, he said.
Sri Lanka will next move onto the ODI series starting with two against Ireland on June 16 and 18 before taking on England in five matches.
England have been playing good cricket in the last six to seven months and they have been winning a lot of games. They play positive cricket and you have got to be on your toes and really good to beat them in the ODI series thats coming up. We are looking forward for the challenge, said Mathews.

Cook ready for Pakistan after Sri Lanka success
LONDON, TUESDAY  England captain Alastair Cook said he was looking forward to the challenge of facing Pakistan following his sides commanding Test series win over Sri Lanka.
Rain meant only 12.2 overs were possible at Lords on Monday as the third Test ended in a draw.
But although denied a whitewash, England had already done enough to secure a 2-0 series win after dominant victories by an innings and 88 runs and nine wickets over the Lankans at Leeds and Chester-le-Street respectively.
England now hold Test series trophies against every other major international side except Pakistan, who beat Cooks men 2-1 in a three-match series in the United Arab Emirates in November last year.
However, they will have a chance to put that right when they face Pakistan in a four-Test series starting at Lords on July 14.
Theyve got a very good (pace) attack, backed up with spinners, Cook said of Pakistan.
Were ready for them. We scored a lot of runs against Australias attack here last year -- I think its going to be a brilliant series.
While Test specialist Cook prepares for Pakistan, wicket-keeper Jonny Bairstow will be looking to take his red-ball form into the intervening five one-day internationals against Sri Lanka.
Bairstows recall into Englands one-day squad was announced just as he was being confirmed as both man-of-the-match at Lords and the hosts overall man of the Test series too.
His 167 not out in the first innings at Lords was his Test-best score and came amidst a series scoring-spree that saw Bairstow total 387 runs at an average of 129, with the Yorkshireman also holding 19 catches behind the stumps.
Together with James Anderson, who took 21 wickets at a stunningly low average of 10.80, Bairstow was the central figure of the series.
Bairstow repeatedly helped England recover from top-order collapses against Sri Lanka and Cook likened his contribution to that of retired former England wicket-keeper Matt Prior.
Hes very similar to Matt Prior... when he was at his best, we could often be 100 for five and hed change the momentum, explained Cook.
Priors wicket-keeping came under intense scrutiny early in his career, especially as England -- be it Alan Knott, Bob Taylor or Jack Russell -- have long prided themselves on their glovemen.
Bairstow, himself the son of the late former Yorkshire and England wicket-keeper David Bairstow, also found his work in the field being called into question after he floored a couple of seemingly straightforward chances against Sri Lanka.
Jonny is enjoying both roles, said Cook. He knows how hard he has to work at his keeping -- that is a conversation we do have, added the captain, who has been able to observe Bairstows work closely from his position at first slip.
Bairstow, meanwhile, was pleased at maintaining the form he showed in South Africa, where his 150 not out in Cape Town in January gave him a maiden Test century.
Off the back of South Africa, it was important to start the summer well, he said.
I hope this is just the start of something that will be special for a while. AFP

Teenager Aaron Gunawardena gets big break
Sri Lankas sensational teenage motor racing rider Aaron Gunawardena who turns 13 this month has been included in the Suzuki team running for the Asian Championship.
Aaron with experienced MotorGP rider Yukio Kagayama
This is the first time a Sri Lankan rider has got a break in an international circuit Suzuki, the Japanese marque introduced its own Asian series that runs in conjunction with the FIM Asia Road Racing Championship (ARRC) and Aaron will be part of the Suzuki team running for the Asian Championship.
Aaron went to Suzuka, Japan to take part in the Asian Road Race and rode his Suzuki 125cc bike in the third round of the five-round race. He is currently placed in the first ten.
Aaron who is the baby of the bunch was one of the first Asian riders to get an opportunity to pose on Aleix Espargaros Moto GP bike for a press release.
Espargaro and Maverick Vinales took Suzuki to another level and after a shaky start to the season Vinales and Aleix have finished in the top six at the last three rounds and sits at No. 5 and 7 on the world championship standings.
Young Aaron said he was excited to sit behind Aleixs bike and touch the controls.

I like to say a big thank you to Suzuki for the motivation and I am happy to be part of Suzukis structured program, said Aaron.
The proud Dad Shane said, Suzukis efforts to discover and groom riders from the Asian region and Suzukis return to the MotoGP in 2015 have been really great. The collaboration with the Asia Road Racing Championship has motivated many riders from all parts of Asia and I have no doubt that we would see an Asian in MotoGP soon.
Yukio Kagayama, who has abundant experience in MotoGP, World Superbike, World Endurance, and the Japanese Championship said he was happy about the progress Aaron has made so far.
Champions are not made overnight. There is a long progression for young riders before they are ready to take on the challenges of the world stage, said Kagayama.
There is no short cut to success and the young riders trained from the Suzuki Asian Challenge must first be exposed to even more competitive racing in the higher classes.
