AC/DC guitarist Malcolm Young dies at 64

Australian guitarist and AC/DC co-founder Malcolm Young has died aged 64 after a long battle with dementia.
He died peacefully on Saturday with his family nearby, a statement said.
Young will be remembered for his powerful rhythm guitar riffs that were instrumental in propelling the Sydney heavy rock group to stardom.
Three Young brothers have been part of AC/DC's history, including lead guitarist Angus. Producer George Young died in October.
"Renowned for his musical prowess, Malcolm was a songwriter, guitarist, performer, producer and visionary who inspired many," the statement read.
"From the outset, he knew what he wanted to achieve and, along with his younger brother, took to the world stage giving their all at every show. Nothing less would do for their fans."
Fans and friends of Young have been posting their tributes to the popular musician on social media.
Tom Morello, of the US band Rage Against the Machine, tweeted his thanks to the "#1 greatest rhythm guitarist".
English rock star David Coverdale, a member of the band Whitesnake and former lead singer of Deep Purple, also offered his "thoughts and prayers".
After forming AC/DC in 1973, Angus and Malcolm Young were credited as co-writers on every song the band recorded between their 1975 debut High Voltage through to 2014's Rock or Bust.
Malcolm was born in 1953 in Glasgow before his family emigrated to Australia when he was 10.
His family confirmed he was suffering from dementia in 2014.
He wrote much of the material that enabled AC/DC to become one of the biggest heavy rock bands and singerBrian Johnson has described him as the band's "spiritual leader, our spitfire".
Their biggest hits include Back in Black, Highway to Hell, and You Shook Me All Night Long. The group is estimated to have sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including 71.5 million albums in the US.
A statement by Angus Young on the AC/DC websitepraises Malcolm's "enormous dedication and commitment" which made him "the driving force behind the band" who "always stuck to his guns and did and said exactly what he wanted".
"As his brother it is hard to express in words what he has meant to me during my life, the bond we had was unique and very special. He leaves behind an enormous legacy that will live on forever.
"Malcolm, job well done."
The band's backbone
Malcolm Young was never the star attraction of AC/DC's live shows. That honour went to his younger brother, Angus, dressed like a schoolboy and duck-walking across the stage like Chuck Berry.
But Malcolm gave the band their backbone. He wrote brutally efficient riffs and played them with concentrated ferocity, proving you don't need to rifle through 127 notes to be effective. And, while AC/DC rarely strayed from the template they set on Highway To Hell and Back in Black, those guitar lines inspired generations, from Metallica's James Hetfield to Guns N' Roses' Izzy Stradlin.
One of the reasons for Malcolm's songwriting economy was that he didn't much enjoy the process of making records."Being in the studio is like being in prison," he said in 1988.
Yet he took great care over AC/DC's sound, stripping out unnecessary flourishes and, unusually, playing with his amp turned down so the microphone could pick out the details.
Still, it was concerts that got his blood racing. "There's nothing like playing on stage," he said. "If it's a good night, it's just like the first night. Same buzz. Same excitement."
That made his final tour with AC/DC all the more tragic. As his dementia progressed, the guitarist found himself unable to remember the riffs to songs like Hell's Bells and You Shook Me All Night Long, having to relearn them for every show.

Fuel Shortage Rumours: Arjuna lodges complaint with CID

The Petroleum Resources Development Ministry has requested the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to immediately launch an investigation regarding false information being spread about fuel storage.

Measures have been taken to check the quality of fuel before it reaches Sri Lanka. There is no need to panic, there is enough fuel available in the country, he said.
The Minister said that spreading false information could be a conspiracy lead by anti-government groups and added that local government elections are also coming up.

He said that the Cabinet approval was granted eight years ago to build tanks, but no initiatives were taken by the then government.
The Minister added that the Cabinet sub- committee appointed to look into the previous fuel shortage issue also suggested building more fuel tanks.
He said decisions with regard to fuel tanks in Trincomalee oil tanks cannot be discussed as there is a court case pending and added that tanks are needed for Kolonnawa, Muthurajawala and Sapugaskanda oil refineries.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist that owners of the fuel bowsers had requested to increase the amount being paid to them, the Minister said that the owners have requested and would look into that when the right time comes.
He said that it is cheaper to transport fuel by train than by bowsers.
Minister Ranatunga said that all the bowsers use to belong to the CEYPETCO, but now private involvement is very high.

Nethicumaras FR preventing CID arrest fixed for support

A Fundamental Rights petition filed by Shanil Nethicumara who is involved in his family business 'Salaka' seeking an Interim Order preventing CID from arresting him was today fixed for support on November 28 by the Supreme Court.
This is over an allegation that he posed death threats to Wijith Wijesuriya over Anika Wijesuriya giving evidence at the Bond Commission against Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
When the matter came up before three-judge-bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare and Justice Vijith Malalgoda, the Attorney General sought a further date to get instructions from the respondent parties.
The petitioner has named IGP Pujith Jayasundara, CID Director Shani Abeysekara and the Attorney General as respondents.
Nethicumara states that what was essentially a personal dispute has been deviously manipulated by fourth Wijith Wijesuriya, the brother of Anika Wijesuriya and other interested parties into an allegation of threats to a witness before the Bond Commission.
Nethicumara said he became aware that Anika Wijesuriya who studied at the same school with him too was called to give evidence before the said Bond Commission, pertaining to an apartment allegedly purchased by Arjun Aloysius from Anika Wijesuriya, which was being occupied and subsequently allegedly purchased by Ravi Karunanayake.
The petitioner stated that on or about October 14 at round 1.30 am, he visited the night club named Love Bar Club located at 58A, Horton Place, Colombo 7which is a usual location the he visits during weekends.
Nethicumara said after a few drinks of liquor from the club and later on towards dawn he walked up to the Gents Washroom and waited in the queue to enter the same.
The fourth Respondent Wijith Wijesuriya, who appeared to be under the influence of liquor came from behind a curtain at the entrance of the wash room and quarrelled with him accusing him of being instrumental in the breakup of the love affair between him and the Petitioners sister.
Nethicumara categorically states he never threatened the fourth Respondent in respect of Anika Wijesuriyas evidence against MP Ravi Karunanayake.
He states that even though the exchange of words was a heated exchange it related to what transpired in the early hours of the day at the Club and the fourth respondents conduct in respect of his sister.
The petitioner states that he became aware through the media that Yasantha Kodagoda PC, Additional Solicitor General had on October 1 informed the Bond Commission, that the petitioner had made death threats against Anika Wijesuriya.
The petitioner states that when he became aware of the above on October 17he lodged a complaint with the Cinnamon Gardens Police Station against the fourth respondent for assaulting and threatening him at the said Love Bar Club on October 14.
Nethikumara said on October 18, several national newspapers too reported that Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda PC informed the Bond Commission October 17 that Anika Wijesuriya who gave evidence before the Presidential Commission fled the country due to death threats posed to her by various parities affiliated with Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The Petitioner states that the newspaper articles implied that SASG Yasantha Kodagoda had informed the Bond Commission that the Petitioner posed death threats to Anika Wijesuriya directly.
The Petitioner states that he was taken by surprise to read the claim that Anika Wijesuriya fled the country due to death threats posed to her by the Petitioner, as he learned from reports published that Anika Wijesuriya left the country on October 6,2017, 7 to 8 days before from the date on which the telephone conversations occurred.
The Petitioner further states that it has been alleged in the media that, Anika Wijesuriyas entire first week of October was spent in Bali and thereafter en route to London she had arrived in Colombo on October 5 in the aircraft bearing No EK 349 at 1.55 a.m.
The Petitioner states that as per the same article, from 2.08 a.m. of October 5, 2017 she was in Colombo until she left the country on an aircraft bearing No. EK 655 on October 6 at to 10.10 p.m. Nethicumara believes that Anika Wijesuriya was during the said time period spending a vacation out of the country and the position that she fled the country due to any death threats is far from truth.
Nethicumara states that in all the afore mentioned newspapers, it was reported that SASG Yasantha Kodagoda stressed that an investigation must be carried out with regard to the incident and that Police protection must be provided to family members of Anika Wijesuriya under Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No 4 of 2015.
Nethicumara states that as per the newspaper articles, Anika Wijesuriya was already been named as a witness under the Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No 4 of 2015.
Nethicumara states that by the contents of all newspaper articles aforementioned, the inference made was that he posed death threats to the 4th Respondent over Anika Wijesuriya giving evidence at the Bond Commission against Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The Petitioner states that on October 20, a national newspaper reported that the Criminal Investigation Department had commenced investigations into the alleged incident of posing death threats to Anika Wijewardana and the investigation is carried out in relation to Minister Ravi Karunanayake and the Petitioner who was again described therein as a cousin son of the Minister Ravi Karunananyake.
The Petitioner states that he apprehends that he will be subject to arrest by the Criminal Investigation Department under the provisions of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No 4 of 2015 which stipulates that bail can be granted only under exceptional circumstances by the Court of Appeal.
The petitioner also seeking an interim order directing the CID Director to take appropriate steps according to law to prevent the owners or managers or employees of the Love Bar Club from tampering with the CCTV cameras installed at the club and from deleting/destroying any footage recorded in the system on October 14.
Presidents Counsel Saliya Peiris with Sajith Jayawardena under the instructions of Sanath Wijewardena appeared for the petitioner. Counsel Asthika Devendra appeared for the respondent. Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne appeared for the Attorney General.

School Monitoring Board to improve quality of education
The Education Ministry has planned to set up a School Monitoring Board aimed at improving the quality of school education in the country, said Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam.
This board will be entrusted with the task of monitoring not only education, but also the material resources available in schools, Minister Kariyawasam said.
The Minister was speaking as the Chief Guest at the annual Prize Day of Viharamadevi Balika Vidyalaya, Kandy on November 18.
The Minister said government, as well as private and International schools, would come under the scrutiny of this Board which would come into operation in January next year.
Minister Kariyawasam said school inspectors performed an excellent job in the past. But, their services deteriorated later as school inspection was done after giving prior notice to the respective principals, resulting in the deterioration of the standard of education.
This shortcoming would be addressed, with the setting up of the School Inspection Board, he said. The Minister said his ministry had now taken measures to restructure the Department of Examinations too.
