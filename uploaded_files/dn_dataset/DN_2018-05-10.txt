CABINET APPROVES ENERGY MIX
The Cabinet yesterday approved a policy paper on the Sri Lanka energy generation, bringing an end to the hotly contested Sri Lankas energy generation mix.
Officials said this will pave way for a swift approval of the impending Longterm Generation Plan.
Reliable sources at the Ceylon Electricity Board told the Daily News that the Cabinet had approved a policy paper detailing that Sri Lankas power generation be a mix of thermal, Liquefied Natural Gas and heavy hydros.
The policy calls for 30 percent of the generation to be thermal, another 30 percent which can be LNG, 25 percent to be heavy hydro and the remaining 15 percent to be fuel based (by products), sources told the Daily News. The Cabinet has no jurisdiction to approve the Longterm Generation Plan put forward by the CEB. It is up to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union who had been engaged in a work-to-rule campaign, said it is now up to the PUCSL to act fast on the Long Term Generation Plan since the Cabinet has already signified their approval of Sri Lankas Energy Policy.
Unionist member Athula Wanniarachchi said the meeting at PUCSL which saw the participation of the CEB General Manager and the Power and Energy Ministry Secretary ended inconclusively. We will strike until the generation plan put forward by the CEB is approved.

Cabinet approves lifting of Glyphosate ban
The Plantations sector welcomed the move by the Cabinet to lift the Glyphosate ban on tea and rubber plantations. The cabinet approval has been given for a period of 36 months.
This followed successful discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena by tea industry stakeholders including Minister of Plantations Industries, Navin Dissanayake and the Chairmen of the Sri Lanka Tea Board, the Colombo Tea Traders Association and Tea Research Institute.
Roshan Rajadurai , Hayleys Plantations Managing Director and former Chairman of the Planters Association of Ceylon said that this was a very timely move. This will give a window of opportunity for the industry to explore an alternative for Glyphosate with the Tea Research Institute, he said.
He also said it will take more than two years to bring the industry back to its usual rhythm. The loss incurred over the last three years is huge.
He emphasized that Glyphosate is a harmless form of fertilizer and it is being widely used all over the world. In India too it is being used in higher concentration.
Meanwhile, Chairman Tea Small Holding Development Authority, K. L. Gunaratne said that one of the biggest issues they faced during the Glyphosate ban was the loss of crop and the additional labour charges for removing weeds manually. This resulted in an additional 12% of expenses per acre.
Meanwhile an official from the Colombo Tea Traders Association said the ban on Glyphosate was imposed in 2015; since then the industry suffered a huge loss, each year. Since there were no perfectly suitable alternatives to replace it, the tea industry was compelled to apply other available herbicides, weedicides and chemicals to control the proliferation of weeds in plantations, which significantly affected the yield. The drop in production of crop, the tea industry incurred a loss of Rs.26 billion each year.
He said that they were using Glyphosate on tea and coconut plantations for over 40 years without any issues.

Chinese national re-remanded till May 23
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday ordered a Chinese national who was arrested over an offence committed under Immigrants and Emigrants Act to be further remanded till May 23.
The Magistrate observed that the suspect cannot be released on bail without the Attorney Generals instructions. The Financial Crimes Investigation Department (FCID) had sent extracts of the investigation to the Attorney General for his advice and police are yet to receive the Attorney Generals advice, the court was informed.
The FCID initiated investigations following a complaint made by the director of Central Banks Financial Intelligence Unit of a deposit of over Rs. 950 million in a private bank in Sri Lanka. The suspect had come to Sri Lanka with another Chinese national for employment and both had engaged in gem business illegally. However, the Magistrate granted bail at the earlier hearing as the suspects pleaded guilty for those counts and ordered the FCID to file charges against the suspects. On the same day the Magistrate also banned the suspects from leaving the country.
The suspects were ordered to be remanded since they were unable to fulfill their bail conditions.
In this immigration case, the Magistrate refused to grant bail to the suspects and also ordered Presidents Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe, appearing for the suspects, to submit relevant documents pertaining to their residence in Sri Lanka. The suspects had allegedly kept passports of eight other persons in their possession. The suspects were also charged with preparing forged documents to stay in Sri Lanka.
The Magistrate yesterday allowed the FCID to record a statement from the other Chinese suspect for an illegal transaction under Prevention of Money Laundering Act No 5 of 2006.

Content with Contempo!
Their voices bring perfect harmony whatever the masterpiece is. They are made up of a group of diverse people some who have just left school, undergraduates, stay at home mums and career women in varied fields. Yet they share the common enthusiasm to continue their musical careers they started in their Alma Mater. Contempo formally known as the Past Bridgetines Choir speaks about their journey and their musical dreams.
Having come a long way since their first public appearance in 2001 all-female choral ensemble has gone on to perform at various concerts and events. For Amanda Raymond singing is not anything new as she was a member of the school choir. Raymond who also led the Western Band of St. Bridgets Convent joined Contempo in the year 2010.
It has been quite an amazing time singing with Contempo I enjoyed singing and the friendship of the members. We are more like family. We have had new members joining in and Contempo keeps growing day by day. Last year was important for us as we took part at the Asia Pacific Choir Games. It was a good exposure and it added a lot of experience for us, Raymond said.
She was appointed the Co-Directress of the ensemble in latter part of the year 2015. All members meet up every Tuesday at St. Bridgets Convent for their regular practice. Each time we have a practice we have about 20 to 25 members and it turns out quite good. All in all it is a nice experience and I will continue to sing with Contempo as long as I can,
Saranie Wijesinghe, an undergraduate finds singing different genres of music to be interesting. In school there were lots of children in the choir and we always sang gospel or spiritual music. Here we learn the technical side of singing. As there is a lesser number we enhance the technique in singing and we also train the voice. I find it quite different to what I sang in school, Contempo is far more interesting, she said.
Participating in the Asia Pacific Choir Games made an impact on Wijesinghe as well. We didnt know what to expect there. We could take something from every choir performance. Even watching the other choirs perform was a learning experience for us, she explained.
Thilini de Alwis is also the Co-Directress of Contempo. She says most of the choristers sing as a hobby. We all love singing so after leaving school we just wanted to continue singing. Although many of us have careers the passion for singing blends us together. It is nice to meet friends every week and to take part in events including ones in school and Past Pupils Associations events, she said.
One of the senior members of the choir Sanjana Selvarajah recalls the memories of singing in the convent chapel and in the school auditorium. It was tradition to sing in the school chapel and in the hall whenever we had school functions or holy mass. Out here we are able to continue that journey we started and we have a good time in doing so, she said.
Last year the ensemble evolved and grew. More members joined the choir and there were changes career wise and personal. We expect to take the choir to the next level and be more involved in events. Sometimes we cannot make it to every event due to unavailability but we do our best whenever we can, Selvarajah added.
The choir so far has done four major shows including Viva la Diva at the Russian Cultural Centre and the most recent 'Forever In Song a choral concert which included toe tapping songs ranging from the genres of gospel/spiritual to pop, rock and jazz staged at the Lionel Wendt Theatre.
Selvarajah was also a part of the team that competed in Asia Pacific Choir Games and she feels this opportunity changed the outlook of the choir. Choir games pushed us really hard and we came out of the shell. It was a great opportunity. The name Contempo is now more on peoples lips and we are glad that we pushed ourselves, she added.
Dilini Perera joined in to say that Choir Games made them realize they are able to do A cappela, Jazz or Barbershop. Suddenly we realized that we could do different types of music for the audience.
There was diversity in singing and it was exciting to sing at Choir Games. Now we are excited about the future. It opened a new chapter for us and audiences will definitely see more of Contempo in future, she said.
Perera feels that being a part of the ensemble is encouraging in every way. Sometimes we bring our children for practices. Our Director is child friendly so not only us our children also get to experience the beauty of singing. Singing has become a part of our lives and it is a family oriented thing for us now, she explained.
The one who brings out the potential and the talent of the choristers into limelight is none other than their Choral Director, Harin Amirthanathan. Taking the reins over from versatile musician Eshantha Peiris, an alumnus of New York University, Amirthanathan says with his classical music background he was not quite sure how he could pitch into a contemporary choir. Every choir is unique. The music Contempo had chosen had a personal touch thus the approach was easier. In time to come you will see more of Contempo, he said.
Amirthanathan is the founder of the 'Vox One a choral music project in Negombo, specializing in classical and contemporary choral music. Among many other involvements Harin also acts as the Director of Colombo Philharmonic choir.
We make music our centre and all other things fall in line. I look forward to work in a classical music project with Contempo. It is a different genre of music.
There is a niche there and we can show our strengths as a female chorus that performs classical music. People are getting to know about the ensemble and there will be a lot more to offer for all music lovers, Amirthanathan added.
The choir is thankful to Principal of St. Bridgets Convent, Sr. Alexandra Mendis for giving them the practice space and also mentioned their past choral directors, Eshantha Pieris, Sheranga Perera and Nishantha Warnakulasuriya with gratitude.
If you want to experience and enjoy their music, you can join Contempo at St. Andrew's Scots Kirk Colombo on May 13 at 9.30am as they sing for Ascension Sunday Service.

COURT STRICTURES ON IUSF PROTEST
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday issued an order preventing the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) from causing public nuisance or entering government institutions.
However, the Magistrate maintained that protesters have no obstacle to engage in a peaceful protest without causing disturbances to the traffic and public peace.
The Magistrate observed that police can take action in terms of section 95 and 106 of the Criminal Procedure Code, if protesters behaved in a violent manner.
The Magistrate made this order following a request made by Colombo Fort Police. In response to a query made by the Magistrate, police told court that government has allocated an area adjacent to the Kollupitiya railway station to carry peaceful protests.
The Fort police informed court that the protest campaign was organised by the IUSF Convener Lahiru Chathuranga Weerasekara, Medical Faculty Students Action Committee Convener Rayan Jayalath and Inter University Bhikkhu Federation (IUBF) acting Convener Rathkarawwe Jinarathana Thera.
The Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) staged a protest in Colombo yesterday against the governments move to convert the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) into the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT).

Creating worlds from words
Fiction is life. Life is fiction. So I keep learning every day. It wasnt long ago that in one of my novels I wrote about a journalist who goes to interview an academic, and falls in love with him. By the time the story ends they are on the path to a happy marriage. A few minutes ago, I found out such encounters are not restricted to the pages of novels only but occur in real life too. In 1994 Ian McEwan met his future wife when a journalist called Annalena McAfee came to interview him for the Financial Times. Both had been married before; he had two sons and two stepdaughters. But true love triumphed. Today they lead a fairy-tale life, writing from dawn to dusk creating worlds from words in a renovated seventeenth-century brick-and-flint cottage, situated on nine acres of land in Cotswolds. Their garden - covered in daisies, walnut trees, a lake and everything else enchanting resembles paradise found.
Life though, hadnt always been this good for McEwan. As he revealed in an interview with the Paris Review, his father, David McEwan was a hard-drinking man. My earliest recollections are of weekday idylls with my mother interrupted at weekends by the loud appearance of my father, when our tiny prefabricated bungalow would fill with his cigarette smoke...Both my mother and I were rather frightened of him. She grew up in a small village near Aldershot and left school at fourteen to go into service as a chambermaid. Later she worked in a department store. But for most of her life she was a housewife, with her generations fierce pride in the orderliness and gleam of the family home.
He describes himself as a quiet, pale, dreamy, boy shy and average in class and very attached to his mother. I was an intimate sort of child who never spoke up in groups. I preferred close friends, says McEwan. His parents were keen for him to have the education they themselves never had. They werent able to guide him towards particular books, but they encouraged him to read, which he did, randomly and compulsively. At boarding school in his early teens he had more direction. When I was sixteen I came under the influence of a very effective English teacher, Neil Clayton, who encouraged wide reading and had the knack of making writers like Herbert, Swift, and Coleridge seem like living presences he recalls. I began to think of literature as a kind of priesthood that I would one day enter.
After he entered the University of Sussex, however, he abandoned the priesthood idea. Upon his graduation he came across a new course at the University of East Anglia, which would allow him to write fiction along with the academic work. He phoned the university and amazingly got straight through to Malcolm Bradbury. But Bradbury said, Oh, the fiction part has been dropped because nobody has applied. This was the first year of the program. And McEwan then said, Well, what if I apply He said, Come up and talk to us and well see.
It was a wonderful stroke of luck, he rejoices. He became the first student in the MA degree for creative writing. That year1970changed my life. I wrote a short story every three of four weeks, and Id meet Malcolm in a Norwich pub for half an hour. Later on I met Angus Wilson. They were both generally encouraging, but they did not interfere at all, and gave no specific advice. That was perfect for me.
In 1971 Transatlantic Review published his first story. Sometime later his name was on the cover of the Review along with Gnter Grass, Susan Sontag, and Philip Roth. I was twenty-three and I felt like an impostor, but I was also very excited. Today he is the author of fourteen novels, including Atonement (2001), Enduring Love, (1997), and Amsterdam (1998), which was awarded the Booker Prize. In 2008, The Times featured him on their list of The 50 greatest British writers since 1945 and The Daily Telegraph ranked him number 19 in their list of the 100 most powerful people in British Culture.
Adam Begley who interviewed McEwan for the Paris review says Ian McEwan is A trim, handsome man, careful, exacting, and (for a writer) curiously un-neurotic. According to the New Yorker he has an old-fashioned talent for creating suspense. McEwan said that one of his goals was to incite a naked hunger in readers. He discusses his technique reluctantly, as if he were a chemist guarding a newly filed patent. Narrative tension is primarily about withholding information, is how he describes his writing style.
Critics say McEwan is a connoisseur of dread, performing the literary equivalent of turning on the tub faucet and leaving the room; the flood is foreseeable, but it still shocks when the water rushes over the edge. At moments of peak intensity, McEwan slows time downa form of torture that readers enjoy despite themselves. In Saturday for example, he keeps the reader jangled for nearly forty pages, wondering along with Perowne if an airplane descending on London has become a terrorist missile. Martin Amis says, Ians terribly good at stressed states. Theres a bit of Conrad that reminds me of Ian. Its Typhoon, when the captain is heading into this terrible storm and Conrad is in the position of first mate. Going into the captains cabin, he notices that the ship is yawing so that the captains shoes are rolling this way and that across the floor, like two puppies playing with each other. You think, Wow, to keep your eyes open when most people would be closing theirs. Ian has that. Hes unflinching.
Asked about his writing process McEwan explains, I have a large green ring-bound bookdeliberately large so I dont carry it around too muchthat lives on the desk, and I doodle in it...Theres a phrase that the English critic and short story writer V.S. Pritchett used: determined stupor. A determined stupor is required in a novelist. You need silence and this kind of mental rambling out of which things begin to emerge. Characters walk to you as through a mist. Certain phrases require unwrapping. Sometimes, for example, Ill write an opening paragraph that I know Ill never have to complete, but knowing that I dont have to continue it liberates me, and that way I trick myself into writing 500 or 600 words.
McEwan also says he loves solitude. Solitude is one of the great privileges of civilization. I dont need it massively; I just need it during the day. Christopher Hitchens once said to me that he thought happiness was writing all day knowing that you are going to be in the company of an interesting friend in the evening, and I think that about gets it. Thats perfection. If from nine oclock in the morning until seven the days entirely your own, and then youre going to take a shower and go downtown and be stimulated in conversation with food and nice wine, you are riding one of civilizations lovely waves.
And yet, he is always available for his children. Heres how he reserves time for them while also getting the solitude he needs to write. The key to that is to always have your study door ajar so your children can wander in and out and think theres nothing special about it. Theyll ignore you until they need you. If you want privacy, the paradoxical answer is to remain constantly available. In spite of all the success he has achieved so far, McEwan thinks he is still in search of his best work. He confesses:  I mean, I could be completely delusional. There has to come a point in your life when your best work is behind you.
But you need to keep alive the illusion that its still in front of you.
Ian McEwan Quotes 01.Falling in love could be achieved in a single worda glance. 02.True intelligence requires fabulous imagination. 03.The moment you lose curiosity in the world, you might as well be dead. 04.Not being boring is quite a challenge. 05.Reading groups, readings, breakdowns of book sales all tell the same story: when women stop reading, the novel will be dead.

Ex-ministers son refutes bribery allegation
The son of late Lands Minister M.K.D.S. Gunawardene yesterday refuted as completely false an allegation made against his late father by former Presidential chief of staff Dr. I.H.K. Mahanama, saying his late father asked him to canvass bribes from prospective investors in the Kantale Sugar Company.
Addressing a press conference convened by the Sri Lanka Human Rights Centre yesterday, Nalin Gunawardene said he was certain that his late father was never involved in soliciting any bribes because he functioned as his fathers coordinating officer at the time.
Dismissing all allegations made by Dr. Mahanama, who is now in remand for allegedly accepting a bribe from an Indian investor, Gunawardene said his late father stayed with his sister when he went to England to seek medical treatment.
At that time Mahanama had even visited England to obtain his fathers signature to hand over the title deed of the Kalutara Bodhi. During that visit too, Mahanama was more interested in finding an investor than seeking his fathers signature for the deed.
He alleged that during the time John Amaratunga held the portfolio following the death of his father, Mahanama tried his best to award the scrap iron tender to the wife of a high-level Naval officer.
Gunawardene said at the time of his death, his father was residing in a dilapidated house belonging to the Land Registration Commission. There was suspicion that Mahanama even siphoned off money from the expenditure made for his fathers funeral.
Sri Lanka Human Rights Centre and CaFFE Director Keerthi Tennakoon addressing the conference said that during investigations conducted into the thee matter of the two officials arrested for bribery concerning the Kantale Sugar Factory, attention should be drawn to their properties and other assets too. There was information that these two officers owned flats at Torrington Square and Sri Jayewardenepura close to the university premises, as well as buildings in Matara town.

First Cabinet paper to promote organic farming
The first Cabinet paper to promote organic farming will be presented to the Cabinet of Ministers next week, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The Ministry has taken measures to promote organic farming to cater to the rising demand for organic products in the local market.
The demand for organic products in the local market is in a growing phase. So organic farming should be expanded to provide opportunities for farmers to earn more income, he said.
According to the Minister, around 3,800 farmers currently engage in organic farming and they cultivate around 4,955 acres of paddy fields.
These farmers mainly grow traditional paddy varieties. They can get a good price for these toxin-free traditional rice varieties since there is a huge demand for them in the local market, said the Minister.
Minister Amaraweera added that the main objective of submitting the Cabinet paper is to encourage more farmers to engage in organic farming.
The Ministry will provide financial assistance for farmers who engage in toxin-free farming, he added.

Five-day working week for health sector in the offing
Discussions have commenced to introduce a five-day working week for health workers, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, overtime payment will be made to health workers who work more than five days a week.
There was a request to increase attendants' training to six months. It will be considered, he said, addressing the May Day rally organized by the Sri Lanka Janaraja Health Services Union, in Colombo, recently.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that at present, workers enjoy an eight-hour working shift but they do not know how hard it was to achieve this by workers in the past.
Some trade unions met their downfall because they became affiliated to various political elements but the Sri Lanka Janaraja Health Services Union became stronger by not being affiliating to any political element. It has a 68-year-old history and I have been working with the union for 40 years, he added.

Fragrance file
Wearing a fragrance is a distinctive way of expressing yourself. Your choice of perfume, too, conveys a lot about your personality. They increase your level of attractiveness, increase confidence levels, reduce stress levels, and double your chances of capturing the attention of your love interest.

Choosing a fragrance for someone else 

There are so many things to consider when shopping for a fragrance as a gift. The first thing I always think about is their personality. For instance, are they cheerful, bright and bubbly If so, perhaps an uplifting, summery citrus based perfume might suit them. Alternatively if they are very career focused with a dry, dark sense of humour, then perhaps something a little more structured and woodsy might work for them.

Key areas on the body to spray on a fragrance 

Perfumes are supposed to be worn on the body, generally on the pulse points, e.g. inside of the wrists, back of the neck, behind the ears, etc. Never spray them on clothes. The oils present in the perfumes will definitely stain your clothes. Also prevent it from mixing with your natural fragrance.
Apply your perfume to these points - the inner wrists, the base of the throat, behind ear lobes, in the cleavage, behind knees, and the inner elbows. As you wear your perfume throughout the day, it will react with your body heat and continue to emit scent.

Same fragrance smelling different on different people 

The primary reason for a perfume to smell different on different people is because everyone has a unique body chemistry and no two are the same (as far as we know!) When the perfume molecules react with the warm pulse points through our heart beat, it also causes a reaction with our skin and hormones which causes the perfume to give off a particular smell.

Becoming immune to your scent 

It is possible to become immune to your scent so that you can no longer feel its smell. After wearing a particular fragrance for a long period it is possible that we get use to the way it smells and become immune to the smell.

Qualities of a good perfume 

* The scent of the perfume should be smelled as soon as a perfume is sprayed, rolled or applied.
* The scent of the perfume should be smelled around the wearer.
* The more long-lasting perfumes generally have better quality.


Expiry period of a perfume 

From the time it is produced, a typical bottle of perfume has an average shelf life of three to five years. This shelf life may be longer if the bottle is unopened and stored properly. Perfumes with a higher concentration of alcohol or water may disappear more quickly through evaporation.

Making natural perfumes at home 

It is always best to buy your perfume from reputed brands because trying to make your own perfume may cause allergic reactions. However there are many organic perfumes available now if one wants to use natural ingredients.
Tips on how to store perfumes correctly
Keep perfume bottles away from direct light.
Don't expose perfume bottles to heat.
Store perfume at a consistent temperature.
Keep perfume away from humidity.
Don't open and close perfume excessively.

The price hike was felt in Sri Lanka as a result of the fuel price hike in the global market, which rose above US$70 on May 8, for the first time since 2014.

The hand of God touches Messi  in Argentine Sistine Chapel
BUENOS AIRES, Wednesday: An Argentine football club has recreated the Sistine Chapel on the ceiling of its gymnasium, with Diego Maradona as God, Lionel Messi as Adam and a host of angels that include Mario Kempes, Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Batistuta.
The mural at Club Sportivo Pereyra in Buenos Aires cost around $20,000 and was inspired by the famous Michelangelo mural in the Vatican. The Argentina version was paid for by donations and is designed to both honour previous generations of Argentine footballers and inspire their heirs. Children play at the club for free and the club president said he hopes they can draw inspiration from seeing their heroes looking down on them.
We were all kids and the ones that loved football wanted to be like our idols, Sebastian Garcia said. When a move doesnt come off you look to the heavens, and when you ask God for a helping hand you have so many of them to choose from on this ceiling.
Maradona, whose inspired performances helped Argentina to win the 1986 World Cup, is considered by many to be one of the greatest players of all-time and is often referred to as El Dios - the God - in his homeland.
He famously dubbed his handball goal against England in 1986 as the Hand of God.
Messi, meanwhile, has won the Ballon dOr world player of the year award five times and has picked up countless trophies with La Liga side Barcelona.
However, he has yet to win a title with Argentina, something he aims to resolve at the World Cup in Russia this year. - Agencies

Have a happy breakfast
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but preparing even a simple breakfast can seem like too much work on rushed weekday mornings.
Science shows that morning nutrition is critical for learning, performance and behavior in school. In fact, kids who eat breakfast have better memory, attention, test scores and attendance than those who skip the morning meal, nutritionists say.
If your kids are tired of the same-old breakfast, consider switching it up with these fast, healthy and simple breakfast recipes.
Waffle Happy Faces
Make breakfast prep a family activity by getting your kids to decorate their own waffles.
Whole grain waffles
2 to 3 tablespoons flavored nonfat Greek yogurt
Sliced fresh fruit of choice
Toast the waffle according to package directions.Top the waffle with 2 to 3 tablespoons of Greek yogurt (so the fruit sticks on).Then use your favourite fruits to decorate the waffle and create a smiley face. Anything goeshave fun with it! For example, create eyes using two slices of banana and a chocolate chip in the center; a raspberry works perfectly for the nose, and sliced kiwi fruit for the mouth.
Barely Banana Protein Pancakes
This delicious pancake recipe will provide a boost of protein.
3 eggs
1 cup oats
1cups cottage cheese
1 small ripe banana
Oil or butter for greasing the skillet
Favourite jam for serving
Put the eggs, oats, cottage cheese, and banana into a blender. Blend until the oats are pulverized, the cottage cheese is blended, and the batter is smooth.Set a skillet over medium heat. Add about a teaspoon of oil and swirl the pan to coat the bottom. Pour about 1 tablespoon of batter into the pan for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear across the surface and the bottom is deeply brown.Use a spatula to flip the pancake and cook until firm to the touch, another 1 to 2 minutes. Serve hot out of the pan with a thin layer of jam.
Make Ahead: These pancakes are best the morning you make them, but if you have leftover batter, store it in the fridge for the next day. The batter will be quite thick, so youll need the aid of a spoon to spread it in the pan. Alternatively, you can thin the batter with a splash of milk.

Cannes FILM FESTIVAL rings in the changes 
The Cannes Film Festival kicks off later, one day earlier than normal, with a number of new measures set to ensure it wont be business as usual. Guests taking selfies on the red carpet risk being shut out of screenings in an attempt to stamp out the practice.
Press screenings for films having their world premieres at the festival will no longer be held in advance. The festival will also work with the French government to set up a helpline for women to report sexual harassment.
It follows allegations that producer Harvey Weinstein raped one actress and behaved inappropriately to others while attending previous festivals. Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sexual activity.

#MeToo and Times Up movements
This years festival is the first to be held since the entertainment industry became engulfed in a sexual harassment scandal. The #MeToo and Times Up movements are sure to be referenced by those attending the event, which runs until May 19.
Among the main competition jury is French actress Lea Seydoux, one of many to accuse Weinstein of making unwelcome advances. The jury will be chaired by Australian Oscar winner Cate Blanchett and include Kristen Stewart, star of the Twilight films. All three stars have worked with Woody Allen, who has been accused by his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow of sexually abusing her as a child. A number of prominent actors have distanced themselves from the director, who has repeatedly denied the allegations.

Female directors in minority
Women outnumber men by five to four on this years jury, which also includes Selma director Ava DuVernay and Burundian songwriter Khadja Nin. The panel is completed by Chinese actor Chang Chen and a trio of male directors - Frances Robert Guediguian, Canadas Denis Villeneuve and Russias Andrey Zvyagintsev.
In the competition line-up itself, though, women are very much in the minority. Of the 21 films in contention, only three have female directors - the same number as last year.

Controversy and comebacks
Further controversy swirls around the Kenyan film Rafiki, which will be shown at the festival as part of the Un Certain Regard sidebar. The film, a love story about two young women, has been banned in Kenya due to its lesbian storyline.
And then there is The House That Jack Built, a film about a serial killer (Matt Dillon), the inclusion of which marks Lars von Triers return to the festival.
The Danish director was expelled from Cannes in 2011 after claiming to understand and sympathise with Adolf Hitler at a press conference. This years festival will open with Everybody Knows, a psychological thriller starring husband and wife actors Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz. It will close next week with The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, Terry Gilliams oft-postponed retelling of the Miguel de Cervantes classic. That screening might be cancelled, however, if one of its former backers prevails in a legal challenge to have it blocked. Paulo Branco - who was at Gilliams side when the project was resurrected in 2016 - claims the film cannot be shown without his permission.
The film sci-fi fans are really looking forward to, though, is Solo: A Star Wars Story, which will have its first screening at Cannes. Expect to see stormtroopers patrolling the red carpet on May 15 - provided, of course, they dont take any selfies.
A notable absence this year is Netflix, who had two films in competition - Okja and The Meyerowitz Stories - 12 months ago. BBC News

Homemade Instant Glow Face Packs
Papaya Face Pack For Instant Glow
You Will Need
1/4 bowl papaya
1/2 teaspoon sandalwood powder
1/2 teaspoon aloe vera gel
Rose water
What You Have To Do
Mash the papaya. Add sandalwood powder and aloe vera gel to it. Mix well.
Add a few drops of rose water and mix everything to get a homogeneous mixture.
Apply this on your face and let it dry for about 20 minutes.
Wash your face clean with tap water.

How Often You Should Do This
Apply this face pack 2-3 times a week.

Why This Works
Papaya, which contains papain, can outdo the performance of even the best of brands when it comes to glowing skin. Papain structures its way through skin pores and offers the benefits of deep exfoliation. Sandalwood also works to remove dead skin from the epidermis and brightens up your complexion. This brings your fresh and glowing skin to the surface.
Banana Face Pack For Instant Glow
You Will Need
1/2 banana
1/2 teaspoon honey
1 teaspoon yogurt
Few drops of rose water

What You Have To Do
Mash the banana and add the other ingredients to it. Mix well.
Apply this on the face and let it dry naturally for about 15 minutes.
Rinse it off with lukewarm water.
How Often You Should Do This
Repeat this twice every week.
Why This Works
Banana and honey are rich sources of natural antioxidants that fight free radicals. Free radicals damage your skin cells and make the skin dry, dull, patchy, and wrinkled. Banana also moisturizes the skin and reduces wrinkles (7). The effects on the skin after 15 minutes are clearly noticeable from the first use itself.
Oatmeal Face Pack For Instant Glow
You Will Need
2 tablespoons oatmeal
1 teaspoon sandalwood powder
Rose water
What You Have To Do
To the oatmeal and sandalwood powder, add enough rose water to get a thick paste.
Apply this paste on the face.
Leave the face pack on for 15 minutes and then wash it off using upward scrubbing motions.
How Often You Should Do This
Do this twice a week.
Why This Works
Oats are the unsung heroes when it comes to skincare! Oatmeal forms the most natural scrub with the goodness of antioxidants and skin hydrating components. The end result is a cleansed face with glowing skin.
Tomato Face Pack For Instant Glow
You Will Need
1 small tomato
1 tablespoon sugar
What You Have To Do
Chop and mash the tomato. Add sugar to this and mix it well.
Apply this mixture on your face and neck.
Leave this on for 10 minutes.
Then, wet your fingertips and massage the face in upward strokes for a few minutes.
Now, rinse off the tomato face pack with cool water.
How Often You Should Do This
Use this as a face pack only every alternate day. Do not scrub your face more than two times in a week.
Why This Works
Tangy tomatoes, when used with right ingredients, add an instant glow to the skin. Sugar and tomato make a powerful spot correction and insta-glow face pack. The mild acids of tomato exfoliate the skin and also balance the skins pH (9). This brings out the true skin tone and glow in your skin. Sugar also helps in the exfoliation process with its coarse structure. Scrubbing boosts blood circulation to the facial skin resulting in radiant and flushed complexion.
Egg Face Pack For Instant Glow
You Will Need
1 egg white
1 tablespoon gram flour
Few drops of lemon juice
What You Have To Do
Beat the egg white well and then add the gram flour and lemon juice to it. Mix well.
Apply this carefully on your face and leave it on for 10-15 minutes or until it dries.
Rinse it off with lukewarm water first and then with cool water.
A teaspoon of honey can be added to the face pack to make it suitable for dry skin.
How Often You Should Do This
Apply this egg face pack 1-2 times a week.
Why This Works
Egg whites give your skin an instant lift and glow. They tighten the skin pores and tone the skin.

Prevailing drought conditions:
Hurulu Wewa farmers request additional Mahaweli water
Hurulu Wewa farmers had urged the government to provide additional Mahaweli water to the Hurulu Wewa reservoir throughout the year, especially during drought seasons similar to that which currently prevails throughout the country.
They had added that they would be capable of producing paddy worth around Rs. 15 million yearly, provided the necessary water facilities were available. The cultivation landscape coming under the Hurulu Wewa is around 11,000 acres. In addition, there are 13 small tanks located near the reservoir.
Hurulu Wewa Irrigation Engineer Athula Wijewardana said that out of the usual water capacity of the Hurulu Wewa; that is, 55,000 acre-feet; only 8,000 acre-feet is available at present, which is adequate only to cultivate around 1,000 acres of land.
As the reservoirs water levels are dwindling, we have requested the Mahaweli Water Management Committee to release a minimum volume of 36,000 acre-feet of water to it. However, so far, we have not received any favourable response, Wijewardana said.
As per our agreement, under normal weather conditions, we receive 10,000 acre-feet of water from Bowatenna to Hurulu Wewa along the 60-km long feeding canal. At present, not even one-fourth of this water quantity is received as water is unnecessarily blocked and stored at the Habarana, Talkote and Hiriwadunna medium-size tanks by the Agrarian Development Department. Furthermore, certain hoteliers and businessman engaged in large-scale cultivations along the banks of the canal, illegally tap into the water supply, he said, adding that such acts prevent the necessary water quantity from being received.
Galenbindunuwewa Divisional Secretary Margret Kumburage said that Hurulu Wewa settlers had been undergoing hardships since they lost cultivations during the previous cultivation seasons due to the scarcity of water caused by the prevailing drought and added that they too, had requested the Irrigation Department Secretary to release 30,000 acre-feet of Mahaweli water for the 2018 Yala season.
However, Kumburage said she had not received any response regarding the matter as well. Meanwhile, it was learnt that drought-stricken Galenbindunuwewa farmers are being denied the Rs. 5,000 worth dry food rations as a result of the criteria indicated in the recently issued circular by the Disaster Management Ministry.
Rajangane farmers would also not receive the said rations under the Ministrys latest categorisation of drought-affected families.
The Hurulu Wewa Farmers Organisation had brought the matter to Irrigation Minister Duminda Dissanayakes attention in order for the programme to be re-assessed.

Inherent right to life in the Constitution
The Constitution of Sri Lanka does not expressly recognize right to life or livelihood or the right to earn a living as a fundamental right, although it does recognize the freedom of every citizen to engage in any lawful occupation, profession, trade, business or enterprise. However, the Republic of Sri Lanka Bill, 2000 which did not become law expressly recognized in its article 8 the inherent right to life. Our Supreme Court has referred to the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights when dealing with issues relating to workers' rights, and attempted to interpret the law consistently with these provisions, and endeavoured to protect the right to earn a living by reference to other constitutional provisions. Irrespective of the fact that there was no direct provision to safeguard the right to life, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka has interpreted Articles 11 and 13(4) in order to bring in the fundamental right to life.
Cited below are several judgments where our Supreme Court has examined the scope and application of the rights relating to work  livelihood  right to earn a living.
(a). Jayasinghe vs the Attorney  General and Others
The decision of the Supreme Court in Jayasinghe vs the Attorney  General and Others is a hallmark of judicial activism in this sphere. To appreciate the value of this landmark decision, it is necessary to note that our courts had previously refused remedies such as the writ of mandamus to compel a statutory employer to comply with provisions of circulars issued by them providing payment of half salary from the seventh month to an interdicted employee where the inquiry into the charges against him is not completed in six months. In Jayasinghes case the Petitioners sought relief in terms of Article 12 read with Article 126 of the Constitution on the basis that the inordinate delay in disciplinary proceedings after interdiction and suspension of pay deprived him of his fundamental rights. In granting relief to the Petitioner, the Supreme Court observed that the Constitution and the law provide safeguards for liberty, and that in the same way the Co-operative Employees Commission Act and regulations provide protection for the livelihood of an employee. It must be noted that Supreme Court had held in several cases that workmen are entitled to join trade unions and participate in lawful industrial action and that no workman can be victimized for doing so.
(b). Bulankulama and Others vs the Secretary, Ministry of Industrial Development and Others
This case is commonly known as Eppawala Judgment. Six of the Petitioners were farmers and / or owners of land situated in the vicinity of the Eppawala phosphate deposits, while the 7th was the chief monk of a temple, which was sustained by land in the area. They claimed that the proposed agreement between the government of Sri Lanka and Freeport MacMoran Resources Partners of USA, a multinational mining company, whereby the latter would be given the right to extensively mine the phosphate deposits situated in Eppawala, would result in violation of their fundamental rights to equality (Article 12(1)); the right to engage in an occupation of ones choice. (Article 14(1) (g)), and freedom of movement and choosing ones residence within Sri Lanka (Article 14(1) (h)).
It was argued that its operations would deprive the petitioners of their land and their means of livelihood or sustenance; cause acute environmental damage to the area including harm to health, cultural monument and the ancient irrigation systems that sustained agriculture, and deplete the phosphate deposits. The petitioners however, did not oppose the utilization of the mineral deposits; they opposed its exploitation in an accelerated and unregulated manner.
The proposed agreement it was averred, also circumvented the need by the company to comply with existing national laws relating to environmental impact assessment. (EIA), thereby denying the petitioners equal protection of the law. Referring to both the Stockholm (1972) and Rio (1992) Declarations on Environmental Protection, Justice Amarasinghe on behalf of the Supreme Court highlighted principles relating to sustainable development and declared that the proposed agreement must be considered in the light of forgoing principles.
After hearing the case, the Court gave relief as pleaded by the petitioners. The Courts pronouncement, among others, that right to livelihood has been included in the Article 14(1) (g)  the right to engage in a lawful occupation of ones choice  and its violation in this case has taken the parameters of the discourse of constitutional protection of human rights to new heights.
(c). Jayawardane vs Dharani Wijayatilake, Secretary Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs and Others
Jayawardane case involved the cancellation of an appointment of an Inquirer into Sudden Deaths. The petitioner alleged that the first respondent had no power to cancel his appointment and that in any event, the cancellation was without cause or inquiry and hence invalid.
It was held:
Respect for the Rule of Law requires the observance of minimum standards of openness, fairness and accountability in administration and this means  in relation to appointments and removal from officers involving powers, functions and duties which are public in nature  that the process of making a decision should not be shrouded in secrecy
Justice Mark Fernando, further stated that Court can and indeed must take judicial notice of the fact that generally a person holding an office which is in public in character is not removed without legal authority without cause, without complying with the audi alteram partem rule and without notice.
The Court added that arbitrariness has been recognized as being violative of the equal protection clause. Therefore, it was held that a denial of natural justice prior to the cancellation of the petitioners appointment was violative of Article 12(1) of the Constitution.
The Court should certainly play an active role in interpreting the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution not to change any of its provisions but to give it a more effective meaning.
It is strongly recommended that the right to livelihood be specifically incorporated into our present Constitution by a constitutional amendment or be included into fundamental rights chapter of the proposed new Constitution as a justiciable fundamental human right.

Minister to promote consumption of nutritious meals
The Fisheries, Aquatic Resources and Rural Economic Affairs Ministry will focus on increasing the nutritious value of our daily meals, Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Soysa said yesterday.
Addressing his first media briefing at the Ministry premises after taking over office last week, the Minister said he now has the Paddy Marketing Board, Livestock Ministry and fisheries all in one.
It was just fish earlier, now I have the whole plate, Minister Vijayamuni Soysa said.
The President through this ministry aims to increase the nutrition value of our daily meals, especially for our rural population,the minister said.
An important factor that one must consider is that 21.4 percent of our children under the age of five are malnurished, the Minister said.
Soysa thus said that he planned to soon roll out a programme to provide school children (starting with national schools) with a glass of milk every day to encourage better nutrition,
In this country we propagate the myth that if you drink milk, you will get phlegm; that is not true. Dont tell your children that. Throughout our history, we have consuming milk products, from curd to ghee. But now we have forgotten that, the Minister said.
The Minister hoped to bring back the programme of making the country self-sufficient in milk production. In the next 18 months, we will focus on increasing production than investing in buildings, he added.
He has also planned on introducing refrigeration facilities to Economic Centres which come under his ministry now. The Dambulla Economic Centre will be the first to have such a facility.
Subjects to ministries, however, are yet to be Gazetted but the minister said work on all areas have already begun given that they would be working on a tight schedule this time around.

"NHDA immediately conducted an investigation and submitted a report to the Minister in 24 hours. We will take disciplinary action against the officers involved", he said.
Palanasuriya said the NHDA has requested for another land and the housing project will continue.
"We will not stop the housing project. Following the incident, NHDA and the Minister decided not to continue the project on that land. Officials have been instructed to be more careful in such situations", he said.
Palanasuriya noted that the investigations so far has revealed the involvement of another two officers on this matter and added that they will also be interdicted.
Addressing the media yesterday at the NHDA, Colombo, the chairman said Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa has appointed an independent committee to investigate the matter. He said that the police is conducting a separate investigation. "Since 2015, NHDA has begun more than 709 housing projects all over the island under the instructions of the Minister, and our target is to complete 2,500 housing projects by end 2019. NHDA is currently working hard to meet the target", he said.
Palanasuriya said that NHDA has no authority over government owned lands and they seek the district office and Divisional Secretariats help to issue appropriate lands to commence the housing projects. Last November, the NHDA Anuradhapura District Manager requested the Ipalogama divisional secretariat to provide a list of 50 families from middle and low income families and a suitable land to commence the housing project.
"We found that the land issued by the divisional secretariat was cleared before the foundation laying ceremony which took place in the beginning of this year. But, the archaeological site adjacent to the land has also been cleared recently using backhoes without the knowledge of NHDA", he said.
He said that since 2015 nearly 50 housing projects commenced in Anuradhapura and they never faced a similar situation before.

The product has also been Pediatrician-tested, Dermatologist-tested and Proven for Mildness by an FDA approved research laboratory in USA.
Dr. Nimal Punyasiri, Director of Research and Development at Natures Beauty Creations stated, We always pride ourselves in manufacturing products of the highest quality, and we are proud to unveil our Panda baby oil which is truly the purest, most natural and highest certified baby oil in Sri Lanka. Majority of other baby oil brands in the market are synthetic and use Mineral Oil, Paraffinium Liquidium or White Oil as they are cheaper than natural oils.
They also use synthetic fragrances. However, to ensure that Panda baby oil is 100% natural and does not contain any synthetic ingredients, we have even carefully selected a natural certified fragrance from France to give our babies natures best. Explaining the benefits of usingan all-natural baby oil, Dr. Nimal mentioned, It is great for naturally moisturizing and softening babys skin, protecting from dryness. Unlike mineral oil, natural oils such as Virgin Coconut Oil, Almond Oil, Olive Oil, Sesame OiI and Sunflower Oil, (which are natural oils found in the Panda baby oil), are similar to the oils produced by the babys skin. Therefore, these natural oils provide a direct caring and nourishing benefit to the babys skin.

It is also a US FDA registered production facility.The ultramodern manufacturing complex is nestled within a sprawling medicinal plant garden created by the company with over 800 medicinal plant varieties.

Judicature (Amendment) Bill:
An anti-corruption endevour that would lessen laws delay: Rajapakshe
The Judicature (Amendment) Bill is an anti-corruption endevour that would lessen the law's delay, Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday said. Dr. Rajapakshe also pointed out that the Bill would be a culmination of public opinion developing since 1994, to accept misappropriation of public funds and property as a serious crime.
Dr. Rajapakshe, who was the former Justice Minister, said that the Judicature (Amendment) Bill would also reinforce the day-to-day hearing procedure. He pointed out that the existing law provisions day-to-day hearing as well. Nevertheless, there are oversights when following this procedure. If this practice was initially entertained in keeping with the circular issued by the Judicial Service Commission Secretariat, this sort of establishment wouldnt have been necessary on the first place, Dr. Rajapakshe said.
Minister Rajapakshe pointed out that law's delay is common in any jurisdiction, however, as per the mandate given to the present government, it should take every possible measure to lessen it. The new government, as it took over, had to overcome two major challenges in the judiciary system. First, the government had to ensure the rule of law and then it had to decrease the delay in of hearing cases, he said.
Answering several queries made by former Minister Susil Premajayantha on the procedure adopted by the Anti-Corruption High Court, Dr. Rajapakshe pointed out that amendments to the Act provides the Chief Justice the power to appoint judges to the Anti-Corruption High Court and to decide on which cases should be taken up at the court as requested by the Attorney General.
If the AG or the Director General of the Bribery Commission decides on which cases should be taken up by this special court, we will lose public trust on the procedure. We cannot disregard the fact that both these independent positions more or less were exposed to political and otherwise influences in previous times. If we are to ensure public trust in this procedure, it is important that the CJ is given the power on these matters," he pointed out.
Minister Rajapakse pointed out that there were 632,000 cases that were delayed in 2012 and the number rose to 745,000 by 2016. 80% of these cases are Magistrate Court cases. 20% of these cases are with regard to Motor Vehicles law offenses and 13% is on drug offenses. he pointed out.
Minister Rajapakshe observed that there were criticism levelled against the Attorney Generals Department on efficiency. When the AGs Department called applications for 32 legal officers, it only received 11. Such less enthusiasm was caused by salary anomalies and low wages. We solved this matter and recruited 47 officers to the AGs Department, he pointed out.
Minister Rajapakshe also said that the government has enhanced the capacity of the Government Analyst, including a Digital Forensic Laboratory that would expedite criminal justice administration in the country. He also pointed out that the disposal rate of cases received and cases completed by the AGs Department has increased from 62% in 2014 to 105% in 2017.
Laws delay, bane of countrys judicial system: Sumanthiran
Law's delay, have been the bane of our judicial system so long. Therefore, even in the Criminal Justice system, the accused in very serious cases have often escaped their due punishment by making use of the laws delays, said TNA  MP M.A. Sumanthiran.
He said so, during the debate on the Amendment to the Judicature Act in Parliament yesterday. He noted that by such measure, a permanent High Court at Bar is to be established to try certain categories of cases which in the interest of justice and in present circumstances, required to be expeditiously concluded.
Commending the Justice Minister for moving the amendment for the setting up of a High Court at Bar, he said, Over a period of time on many occasions, it had resulted in wrong doers being pronounced not guilty due to the unavailability of witnesses, etc. If a trial happens 10 - 15 years after the incident, sometimes even eye witnesses are invariably not among the living, documentary evidence goes missing, which have been our experiences when long delays happen in the process of the criminal justice system.
Hence, he noted that this is an amendment that is timely and had been brought because there is a clamour in the country and expectation that certain types of offences by which the countrys economy had been weakened, certain categories of offences that have been committed with impunity had not been taken up or pursued. Particularly, crimes that have been committed by persons in political authority, if they are not taken up in a timely manner, invariably, it would be dragged on until there is a change of regime and when they are back in the saddle, they would ensure that the process is halted permanently. This has been one of the biggest reasons why corruption at the highest levels in this country had never been effectively addressed, he added.
A Parliamentary term of five to six years, he said, is insufficient to conclude serious trials involving political bigwigs, while our country has a history of changing regimes and when there is a change, they escape permanently.
He also noted that the present government came with a specific mandate to address corruption and to deal with corrupt politicians in particular, bring them before the law and ensure that the due course of justice is followed. Unfortunately, three years after the change took place, there had been one conviction, which had also been made subject to an appeal. In a system where we generally have two appeals, we can envisage the lapse of another decade or so before finality is reached even with regard to that one conviction. This is the history of the criminal justice system which had turned ineffective due to these long delays.
He cited an example of such judicial delays where it took 17 years for the conclusion of the case where an attempt was made to assassinate the former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaranatunge, which took 17 long years. He pointed out that it was not in the best interest of anyone for such criminal cases to be dragged on for such long periods.
He said the High Court at Bar would now be able to hear certain cases on a day-to-day basis, where no one would be the loser, because even an accused could expect judges to remember factors in his favour, when they write the judgement. It is so with the prosecution as well. No one should be made to rely on imperfect memories of those who hear the case, he said, adding that he hoped that the beginning that is envisaged with the establishment of this High Court at Bar, the country would see a new chapter dawning in the disposal of cases in the country, dealing with serious crimes, particularly, in the area of corruption, bribery and other financial crimes and the impunity that had hitherto been enjoyed by various persons of political hue, will be brought to an end.
E-vote system back to normal: Speaker
The electronic voting system was put into use again in Parliament yesterday, after sorting out its technical glitches.
MPs voted on the Judicature Amendment Bill using their finger prints.
The newly installed e-vote system experienced technical glitches during the vote on Active Liability Management Bill on March 23 and thereafter a committee was appointed to find its technical errors.
Party Leaders decided not to use the e-vote system until its errors were sorted out. Accordingly, the vote on the No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister was taken by name.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya announced in the House yesterday morning, that he received the report of the Committee and it was a minor system confusion where the wiring had been faulty. He said the system had been rectified with the assistance of the relevant IT Company. The Speaker went on to say that the e-vote system in Parliament had used the most modern equipment.
Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena in a lighter vein, added that the Government had got its wires crossed. MP Weerawansa queried as to whether the system had been synchronized with the latest seating arrangements in the House. The Speaker assured the system would function properly.
Fire in Buddha Sasana Ministers room, no damages reported
A fire had erupted in the room of Buddha Sasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday. Officers of the Fire Extinguishing Unit of Parliament, rushed to the scene immediately and quelled the fire.
Parliament employees who had noticed a smoke emanating from Minister Pereras official room, had informed the Sergeant-at-Arms Anil Parakrama Samarasekera.
Deputy Sergeant-at-Arms Narendra Fernando had visited the scene and summoned the Officers of the Fire Extinguishing Unit, who managed to control the fire.
According to a source, a short-circuit in the power supply to the Air Conditioning system had caused the fire. No damages have been reported.
Speaker to discuss vacant Dy. Speaker post with President, PM
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to have discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe concerning the vacant Deputy Speaker post held by Thilanga Sumathipala.
UNP MP Nalin Bandara in Parliament yesterday, queried from the Speaker as to whether the Deputy Speaker post held by Thilanga Sumathipala had fallen vacant.
Sumathipala crossed over to the Opposition on Tuesday along with 15 SLFP members. The Speaker last month informed Parliament that Deputy Speaker Sumathipala had tendered his resignation to President Maithripala Sirisena nearly a month ago.
When questioned yesterday, the Speaker however said that he was yet to be officially informed by the President over the resignation letter.
I have not received any message from the President in this regard. However, Sumathipala told me that he had submitted his resignation letter to the President some time back, but I am unable to make any official announcement in this regard. I will inform the President and Prime Minister and take appropriate steps, he told the House.
Intervening at this point, former Minister S B Dissanayake, who represent the SLFP 16 Group, argued that there had been previous instances where Opposition MPs served as Speakers and Deputy Speakers. Even in this Parliament, Deputy Chairman of Committees is a member representing the Opposition. Therefore, Sumathipala could continue in the Deputy Speaker post if he and our party wishes to do so, MP Dissanayake added.
There is much delay in hearing high profile cases in country: Ajith P. Perera
There is a serious delay in hearing serious cases in this country. Based on a survey carried out by the AGs Department, from the date of the crime to the date of indictment in the High Court, it takes nearly 4.7 years. From the date of indictment to the date the case is taken up for hearing, it takes nearly another 3.7 years. From the date of hearing of the case in the High Court, to the date of the verdict, it takes another 1.8 years, totalling around 10.2 years for a case to be heard in the High Court. Further, there are two opportunities for appealing in the Supreme Court and the Appeal Court, while it generally takes around 7 years for the appeal process. The whole process from the High Court to the Appeal Court process takes approximately 17 years, said State Power and Energy Minister Ajith P. Perera.
Joining in the Second Reading of the Judicature Amendment Bill in Parliament yesterday, he noted that not only murder, rape and terrorism related cases, but even high profile corruption and fraud cases too takes many years.
At the time the FCID was established, there were some who claimed that it was illegal, but eventually, the Supreme Court determined that it was legal to set up the FCID. It is commendable that the FCID had completed investigations on over 100 cases and sent these files to the AGs Department for further action, he said.
Similarly, he pointed out that the CID too had completed investigations into over 20 cases. The Police Department should be commended for having carried out their responsibilities during a very trying time even when they were not receiving the required backing and encouragement of the Government. They have carried out their duties as dedicated professionals and I offer them my heartfelt appreciation and commend their services.
Minister urges for Special Court to handle Buddhist affairs
Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday, urged for a special court to handle cases pertaining to Buddhist clergy and Buddhist temples.
The Constitution mentions on establishing such a special court concentrating on Buddhist clergy, temples and the Vihara Devalgam Act. However, such a step has still not been taken. I am sure no one will stand against such a special court. I would like to request the Justice Minister and other relevant authorities to this, Minister Ranawaka said.
Minister Champika Ranawaka commenting on the Judicature (Amendment) Bill, said that it would solve many issues with regards to the judiciary in the country. He also said that it would resurrect peoples hopes for an anti-corruption initiative rallied by the present government in 2015.
When we launch a process as this, we should not look for traitors, but for our short comings and attend to them. We should not look for heroes, but for structures and procedures to fight crime and corruption, he further said.
Minister Ranawaka observed that the present government had been successful in making the judiciary independent. He also said that the government has taken a series of steps to expedite the criminal justice administration of the country.
Government presents three Bills for First Reading
The Government yesterday, presented two amendment Bills in Parliament to empower the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) to file cases based on facts revealed by the Commissions of Inquiry.
The Bills to amend the Commissions of Inquiry Act (Chapter 393) and the Bribery Act (Chapter 26), were presented for First Reading by Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake at the commencement of sittings.
According to the Amendments, Director General of the Bribery Commission is given the power to file cases under the Bribery Act or Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law based on the findings of the Commissions of Inquiry appointed by the President.
The amendments need to be passed by a 2/3 majority in Parliament.
The Government presented another Bill yesterday, to amend the Sri Lanka Tea Board Law, No. 14 of 1975 in order to appoint a Working Director to the Board.
Bills to amend Penal Code, Code of Criminal Procedure passed
Two Bills to amend the Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure and to increase the age limit of criminal responsibility from 8 to 12 years, were passed in Parliament yesterday.
They were moved in the House by Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala.
According to the Penal Code Amendment Bill, the age limit of 8 years under which no act of a child is considered an offence has been increased to 12 years.
Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under 12 years of age. Nothing is an offence which is done by a child above 12 years of age and under 14, if the judge is of the opinion that he has not attained sufficient maturity to understand the nature and consequences of his act, the Bill stated.
If the child who committed the offence is between 12 and 14 years of age, law enforcement authorities must consult the discretion of a Magistrate to determine whether the child has the required degree of maturity to commit an offence.
JO agitates against taking up Judicature Amendment Bill for debate
Joint Opposition members yesterday in Parliament, agitated against the taking up of the Judicature Amendment Bill for debate by raising a number of procedural matters.
The Bill aimed to set up a permanent High Court at Bar to expedite cases of large scale corruption and financial crimes.
NFF Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa at the commencement of the debate, charged that the Bill had not been referred to the Sectoral Oversight Committee and that it was a serious breach of Parliamentary procedure.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella, refuting the claim said the Bill was referred to the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Tuesday (May 8) and its report already lies on the tables of MPs.
MP Weerawansa went on arguing that the Sectoral Oversight Committees of the previous session of Parliament were not valid and that they have to be re-appointed. This claim was refused by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, who clarified that Standing Orders are clear that Oversight Committees continue to function despite the prorogation.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena argued that the Bill changed the provisions of the Constitution and therefore it needed to be passed with a two thirds majority. Minister Kiriella once again clarified that all clauses of the Bill that the Supreme Court said inconsistent with the Constitution, had been duly amended.
The Speaker also said the Attorney General had confirmed that the amendments were consistent with the Constitution.

People have lost faith in Government : Vijitha Herath
When the present Government came into power, one of its first promises to the people was to put a stop to corruption and fraud. The government made this pledge on every political platform and assured that corruption and fraud would be prevented in every institution in the country. However, three years down the line, this government has still not been able to win the trust and confidence of the people and practically honour their promise by punishing the fraudsters, stop corruption and fraud and implement the law, said JVP MP Vijitha Herath.
Joining the debate on the Judicature Amendment Bill in Parliament yesterday, he said, Now the country is at a stage where they are finding it difficult to carry on. Due to the governments inefficiency, the people have lost faith in the them. Under such a situation where the peoples trust in the government has diminished, the government has brought in this Judicature Amendment Bill.
He noted that at the time the government won the peoples mandate in 2015, Civil Society Organisations and the public made a strong appeal to the government to set up special courts to try cases of corruption and fraud. He said at the time, there was a question whether a special court or a separate court should be established. However, there was a legal issue in amending the Constitution in order to set up special courts. As such, discussions were initiated with regard to setting up of separate courts to expedite these special cases. After a long lapse of three years, finally it has been done.
He said the country had been plagued by corruption and fraud, wasting public funds and as such, people were at a stage where they had enough of these crimes and demanded the government that the rogues be brought to book and punished. He said that although the government came into power on the promise that it would stop corruption and bring the previous culprits before law, it did not take long before members of this regime too resorted to large scale frauds running into billions of rupees.
Hence, he said although the government had brought in these laws now, the trust placed on the government by the people, have already been lost and the people have no faith in the government. It is now too late as the government did not take the necessary action at the right time. The government had allowed this issues to fester without taking action initially and now it seems that these laws are brought in for political revenge, he said, adding that the issue of corruption cannot be addressed simply by bringing in these laws without the governments committed mediation.

Performance... perseverance...and pressure to survive
All islanders hail the timely arrival of May and its traditional customs that bind us together...From our ocean to the mountains and everything in between.
The fortunate inhabitants on planet rugby, undeterred by developmentswere treated to some scintillating game time in the middle.
At home a fabulous final leg of the 74th Bradby, proudly supported by Singer Sri Lanka, and a hugely anticipated Royal saga.
But only those who managed to catch the game in Pallekelle ...will cheer both sides ...
The Bradby conclusion is always a mighty occasion, whichever way you choose to observe our young gladiators in the middle.
I for one was looking forward and hugely confident that the lions heart would stand up under pressure, and surprise Royal wholesale.
In fact, all considered, pundits and resident experts included...I expected Trinity to win the leg!
Here was a golden...nay platinum of opportunities to come out blazing, and stamp some class.
Well it almost stepped up and shocked our nation.
Belief and commitment was the balm prescribed...but what we got was a first half of hesitancy and soft options, despite decent possession.
Unfortunately and for obscure reasoning...Trinity chose to wait for Royal to run at them.
Reid Avenue already had the cabinet dusted and polished for the shield.
Trinitys emergence from slumber, resulting in 3 stupendous tries that ignited the lions faithful, and much relief for Lote Raikebule and staff.
Had they decided to run hard and play out of their skins ...a famous victory was written on that wall.....
Alas, history and reality handed Royal a clinical finish and tantalizing victory that almost looked like clocking up a century from both legs.
The game needed stubborn heart and much courage from the lions den.
Then skill, pace, power and brute finish to stifle the tuskers.
What a grand Bradby indeed.
Now we shift back off Olympus, breathe the sea level oxygen, and refocus on the Singer league....
Can the unbeaten tag that Royal own be taken from them
Can St. Josephs really slide up the rankings or will the Joe-Pete shatter all expectations
Mesmerizing matchups...Peters v Trinity and Royal v Peters before the month of June runs in.
What the stars forecast and the oracle will present...might just be one and the same. Royal for the title or Peters to the front and shocks again...What a relentless season its become..utterly absorbing and right down to the wire.
Only time, injuries and the fittest will dictate in the end ....both mental and physical conditioning, the vital difference between victor and vanquished in paradise.
Reality bites when you least expect...
I am hopeful that all is well and clean on the nutrition/performance platform.
Assuredly it has been a heart throbbing, max on max, in the middle for 70mins, right across the Singer premier school leagues.
But most importantly, I hope it is without the extra benefits of listed performance enhancing stimulants.
Naturally the system must be locked and schools totally responsible for player wellness and honest fair play.
There must be a clinical defined formidable line that embraces the virtues of a level playing field at all times.
No hint of compromise ...or leniency at any given turn or time.
Well played to all the schools, well done all the coaching and management...essentially the backroom team that are on the button 24x7...
I am confident that all investors and old boys plus parents believe in the same and stand for those fundamental principles of fair play and justice at all times.
The game is greater than all of us, it s a colossus that strides the planet with consummate ease ...it is up to us Sri islanders to embrace and stand firm.
If we inculcate those principles in our kids ...so they carry that same flag with honesty, respect and pride ...on and off the field.
The code is mighty indeed.
All hail the island rugby heart and the grandest most relentless season so far.
Cheers to the players who make the games so special.
Bula bula Sri apey!

Presidents former Chief of Staff, ex-STC chairman further remanded
Presidents former Chief of Staff I. H. K. Mahanama and former State Timber Corporation (STC) Chairman P. Dissanayaka, who were in remand custody for allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs. 20 million, were further remanded until May 22 by Colombo Additional Magistrate Buddhika Sri Ragala.
Attorney-at-law Asitha Anthony, the Assistant Director (Legal) of the Bribery Commission informed Court that a person named Joseph Pillay who claimed to be a member of the LTTEs Intelligence Wing had come to the office of the Complainant (Indian national) on May 8 and sought information regarding this case.
Anthony further submitted that this incident could have an impact on the investigation and moved Court that the suspects be further remanded for a period of two weeks. He further added that the complainant had informed this incident to the Cinnamon Gardens Police and the Bribery Commission and law enforcement authorities would investigate regarding the concerned influence.
Presidents Counsel Rienzie Arsekularatne with Counsel Ajith Pathirana and Udara Muhamdiramge appearing for the suspects moved Court that their clients be released on bail since most of the investigations pertaining to the incident had been concluded.
The investigation initiated with the complaint that I. K. Mahanama had demanded a bribe of Rs. 540 million from an Indian investor who was ready to acquire a section of the Kantale sugar factory. Mahanama had been attending to this matter of settling the transaction some time ago while he was the Land Ministry Secretary.
However, the Indian investor had refused to pay the sum stating that it was high and demanded to reduce it. Within several weeks, they allegedly had agreed to accept Rs 100 million. The two were arrested at a car park of a luxury hotel in the capital Colombo, on May 3, by the officers of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption while accepting a bribe of Rs. 20 million.
However, the Colombo Additional Magistrate stated that a number of documents needed for the investigations are still at the places where the suspects worked and the Bribery Commission needs sufficient time to carry out further investigations. He added that even though the requests have been made, the documents have not been submitted. The Additional Magistrate further stated that if the suspects were given bail, the investigations could be disrupted.
The Magistrate also ordered the Bribery Commission to expeditiously complete the investigation into the incident against the suspects.

President charts new course for coalition
President Maithripala Sirisena diagnosed correctly when he said that the failure of the two partners of the unity government to duly appreciate their own respective roles in a coalition arrangement has led to the present confusion and frustration of the people.
Addressing the new sessions of parliament on Wednesday the Head of State said the last three years demonstrated that the country is still lacking in political and social maturity needed to realize the objectives of a coalition government adding that the power struggle in government and political parties in the last three years had driven the people to despair.
If we are to overcome the challenges faced by the country, the power struggle between the two main parties in the coalition government must cease. The competition for power between the Opposition and the ruling party must also cease, he said.
He went on to point out that even though consensus governance is adopted in many countries in the world it is yet a foreign concept to Sri Lanka. The President went on to stress that the role of the Opposition as well as the approach of the political allies of the coalition government should undergo change.
The President has hit the nail on the head. The two parties in the coalition were working at cross purposes from the very outset, one trying to trip the other at every turn, in complete ignorance, or, lack of understanding as to how a coalition government should function. Ministers on both sides were contradicting each other and often times critical of each others policies and approaches. Needless to say, the wrong signals were sent to the public of instability and chaos and their frustration found expression at the recent local government elections.
True, this was a novel experience to the sworn enemies in Sri Lanka's politics and cracks were bound to appear in the coalition sooner rather than later. To begin with, this was also the first experiment in coalition governance since independence featuring the two main parties (there were other coalitions like Dudley's hath havula and the United Front Government of 70-75, though the SLFP entered into a No Contest Pact with the Reds).
If one is to put the finger on the precise reason for fissures in the current unity government it boils down to the electoral fortunes of both constituent parties. Both vied with each other for the attention of the electorate. Ministers and MPs in the SLFP/UPFA were making comments uncomplimentary of those in the UNP and vice versa. This naturally led to a clash of opinions, which is the bane in any coalition arrangement. Hence, the President's appeal to the warring factions to hold their fire and work as a single unit for the benefit of the people for the remainder of their tenure.
This could now pose no problem with the exit of the troublemakers in the form of the 16 renegades who, though vowing to remain within the SLFP fold, while occupying the Opposition benches, betrayed in no uncertain terms where their true loyalties lay. The good riddance should be seized upon by the unity government to steer a clear course and deliver on the promises.
It should lose no time in fitting into coalition mode taking a leaf out of other such arrangements around the world, such as Britain and Germany which are having smooth runs despite the occasional hiccup. Ministers should speak in one voice on policy decisions strictly adhering to collective Cabinet responsibility.
Inter-party disputes should also be settled in the process, particularly within the UNP. Back benchers should fall in line with the decisions of the leadership. Any form of dissension at this stage could pose a challenge to the smooth run of the unity government and ruin the electoral prospects of the Greens.
Immediate steps should be taken to rectify the ills on the economic front and order brought out of chaos. In his statement the President called for a social friendly people oriented economy and a political vision that recognizes the political heartbeat of the public. However care should be taken to avoid a splurge in government spending on populist projects lest this leads to runaway inflation and further impact on the cost of living.
Be that as it may, the President has signaled a new beginning for the unity government in his speech to parliament. He has also included the Opposition in his invitation to assist the government, shedding the vituperative politics now on display. He told the House that the country is not in a situation to play power politics, but it is in a position where a collective effort to overcome its challenges have become mandatory.
What he said in so many words was that this country cannot enjoy the luxury of divisive politics at this juncture but that a collective will is needed to confront the multiplicity of challenges that lay ahead.
It will be the hope of all patriotic Sri Lankans that all political parties will shed their parochial considerations for the achievement of the common goals set for the country.

## Title: Pros and cons of Rupee  depreciation
## Supertitle:

Pros and cons of Rupee  depreciation
Everything has a price, measure of which is different from country to country. It is with the increase of international trade among countries that each currency starts having a unique value, due to the demand for that particular currency. Any country engaged in importing and exporting activities has to buy US dollars for its transactions in the foreign exchange market, the market where currencies are exchanged.
All is decided by demand and supply theory. Accordingly, if we import more than exports, our demand for US dollar is higher than supply resulting in rupee depreciation. In other words, when we have to pay more for buying a dollar, it says that the rupee has depreciated against a dollar. On the other hand, when we have to pay less for buying a dollar, it can be said that the rupee has appreciated against a dollar.For an example, recently, the dollar reached up to Rs.155. However, it was about Rs.8 in 1977. Accordingly, it is needless to state how the rupee has deprecated for the past few decades.Hence, it is important to ascertain what causes are behind this kind of speedy rupee depreciation.
Causes
It is needless to pen down here that every country in the world can never be self-sufficient, as wants are complex. Nevertheless, each and every nation has to produce what they can and import and consume what they cannot produce within their boundaries. It is called comparative advantage in economics.
As mentioned above, exports raise the value of the currency, while imports lower the value of the currency. Quantity of exports does not matter, as long as the value of export items is high. The main reason as to why value of the rupee has fallen in such a rapid way is that the country has been producing and exporting low quality, rather raw items which are sold at very low prices in the world market. Furthermore, Sri Lanka has been importing value-added products including crude oil purchased at higher prices. This is the common story as well as the big picture behind the rupee depreciation.
It can be stated that oil import and foreign borrowing has largely led to this depreciation. As even a part of local electricity generation is done by using diesel which ultimately contribute towards a high import bill of crude oil.
Effects
When it exceeds the limits, it weakens the economy. As a country exporting less and importing more, Sri Lanka is negatively connected with international trade. Thats why; it goes from bad to worse, when the rupee depreciates against the US dollar.
It encourages exporters to export more and earn more profits, as their income goes up with rupee depreciation. It is due to the recently gained GSP plus that the nation could export more goods contributing to the economy. However, apparel exports, main beneficiary of the GSP plus, did not go up as expected, recording a growth of 4.1 percent in the first quarter of this year. In my opinion, the nation has not yet been able to fully capitalize on the trade concession, even though the fact that export-oriented economy is the way forward is widely accepted.
Rupee depreciation will result in inflation, as imported items will be very expensive in the market. The fact is that there are some essential commodities being imported such as crude oil which consumers cannot avoid at any cost. This will be something more serious in an economy where people are used to buying imported items rather than locally produced items.
On the other hand, higher level of inflation will undoubtedly lower the peoples purchasing power, having a negative impact on sales of the businesses which thereafter reduce profits and business expansions. It is obvious how rupee depreciation is capable of creating unfavorable business environment.
Intervention
Even if market forces, demand and supply, should be allowed to behave freely and decide on price in the market, the central bank as the agent of the government can pump dollars into the exchange market, in order that rupee can survive to a certain extent.
Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, a deputy governor of the Central Bank, recently stated that the Central Bank intervened to support the rupee and will continue to do so when necessary, given the countrys US$ 10 billion foreign currency reserves.
Solutions
Although dollar-pumping through reserves is a short-term solution, quantity of exports through high level of production should increase as the long-term solution.
In fact, there are many more things to be done with respect to GSP plus, while Free Trade Agreements (FTA) will also be helpful to encourage exports.In conclusion, we want more dollars to come in.
Hence, without getting restricted to exports alone, the country should make further attempts to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and receive higher amount of remittances by dispatching highly skilled professionals abroad.
Then, the rupee will regain its value.

Public officials must disclose information - RTI Chairman
The new Right to Information Act has had a strong first year, but public authorities need to shed their culture of secrecy, RTI Commission Chairman Mahinda Gammanpila said Tuesday.
He was speaking at a seminar at the Institute for Policy Studies in Colombo.
The public authorities in this country, of which I myself have been a member. the culture is a negative kind of response towards the disclosure of information, he said.
He said many officers are briefed that all government documents are supposed to be confidential. This is a kind of legacy that we have inherited from the colonial administration to the local administration of today, he said.
Gammanpila said that in appeals before the RTI Commission, the quasi-judicial body set up by the Act to moderate disputes, most public officers agree to disclose information once the law is properly explained and they are given an official order.
Except for one or two instances, we have not come across officers who are ready to say no, he said. But for citizens to be able to freely and easily exercise their right to information, there is a need for us to change this attitude in the minds of the public officials, he added.
Chairman Gammanpila said there were other mechanisms in law that need to be strengthened on the ground, such as the proactive disclosure of information like budgets and expenditures.
In addition, some private companies and non-governmental organisations that are funded by the government or contribute significantly to public activities do not realise they are covered by the law.
We need to explore the possibilities of enlightening them or educating them on this matter, he said. There are very many NGOs and INGOs which have influence on the public life of this country, so the citizens have the right to obtain information on the activities that have been carried out.

The question of afterlife
This refers to the letter in the Citizens Mail by G. A. D. Sirimal on May 7. For me, Buddhism differs from all other religions. It stresses the utmost urgency in terminating the rebirth process (afterlife) here and now.
The urgency was such that Prince Siddhartha who became the Buddha, could not even wait till the next morning to find the solution to the problem of suffering, for he realized what was in store for him. As such, for me, the question of afterlife is irrelevant and I have devoted my entire life for full time meditation for the single purpose of ending of Samsara (continuation of life)  here and now because there is no choice!

## Title: RIGHT TO LIFE  THE NOBLEST OF ALL RIGHTS
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, May 10, 2018 - 01:00
RIGHT TO LIFE  THE NOBLEST OF ALL RIGHTS
Shelly, marking the end of his poem, The Triumph of Life raises the age old question, Then, what is life Similar overtones resonate in Shakespeares As You Like It as despondent Jacques delivers these lines in a soliloquy viewing life of man in seven stages laid between birth and death. The term life carries a history where like-minded philosophers and biologists have struggled to advance a definition on an almost incomprehensible and irreducible notion as life. Some of them have even rejected the idea of there being a definition at all.
Biology defines life by placing a distinction between animate and inanimate objects. Every creature with ability to breathe literally holds life within it. However, that is not all. The conception of life in terms of biology is only one aspect to the story. For instance, a man does not die only of food poisoning or in being killed by his enemy. A person could even be dead with his dead spirit, as against a state of being full of life. One could also say that life is a process of consistent growth and flourish as Aristotle theorized. Any factor discouraging the said process might affect the development which may otherwise be achievable.
Open market economy
In a commercially developed world that is dominated by the open market economy, life of an individual is shaped by the commercial elements on which his needs are founded upon. Therefore, every individual has a separate identity of his own identifiable in terms of the quality he maintains. In other words, life in totality is not simply mere existence but its about quality - quality in every individual case.
Hence, life is not merely a matter of physical existence but is inclusive of all such details, intricacies and all such aspects that could influence existence of a human person in totality - physical, mental, spiritual, social, economical, political and the list goes on. It is those that distinguish all persons, a doctor from a nurse, a teacher from a student, a rich man from a beggar, a child from his parent, a man from a woman and again the list goes on. Ideally, it would mean to facilitate a person with everything that he may need to lead his life to the fullest. But then again should not it depend on the ultimate definition of what life is As long as no definition to life can be adduced, these matters shall eternally remain unresolved. In view of such a complicated reality with subtle intricacies distinguishing one person from another, it would be the most difficult task to ensure that all men live their life to the fullest.
This perception is equally true of the philosophy of ones right to life. The right to life, in its most basic sense, is the right of man to exist as a human person. However, as life itself is an irreducible notion, the right to life equally goes beyond a mere suggestion of mere existence. Therefore, the right to life is to live life to the fullest, the ideal life with all needs met. In this sense, it becomes thus far the widest and the most intrinsic right of all other rights. Many religious traditions equally buttress the dignity of life and the right to such sublime life. Therefore, full operation of this right would mean that all factors affecting a human person to lead life would have to be facilitated and anything which could hinder such progression be prevented. Does it then mean that a person who is deprived of those provisions to secure the perfect life does not enjoy his right to life In the broader sense, the answer would be positive.
This is a primary responsibility of the governments of the nations and the right been encoded as a human right in the respective constitutions is often the first step. But given the above discussed complexity, those varying conditions or qualities decisive of each persons individual right cannot be regulated by one single body as much common in identity as the government.
Therefore, legally this right has been restricted to be used only as against physical deprivation of life. Accordingly, it generally establishes that every human being has the inherent right to life which shall be protected by law and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life. In other words, it places the right in the realm of mere existence as against quality. Rather theoretically, in this sense, right to life shall be preservation of ones life against all elements and factors that could otherwise destroy it. But this again is apparently a matter of merit.
Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the most authoritative document on human rights in the world, which was adopted and proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in the year 1948, affirmed that every person has a fundamental right to life, liberty and security. The same was reaffirmed in several other documents that mainly includes Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Article 11 of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families and Article 10 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. By today, almost all the constitutions of the nations in the world have recognized it as a fundamental human right.
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
The Bill of Independence of the United States of America has it as their foremost right and our neighbouring country of India has equally been able to recognize it under Article 21 of their Constitution. However, quite surprisingly, although more than half a century has lapsed after the introduction of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and it has long been absorbed into the system of international law, the right to life was not included in the list of fundamental rights of the existing Constitution of Sri Lanka. Many observers of this lacuna are seen to have simply stated the observation while no particular reason in this regard has been cited for discussion or argued on. However, the recent proposals for a new constitution could be seen to have given enough consideration to the issue hence the inclusion of the right to life under the new proposed set of fundamental rights.
The irony is that in todays world, the mere codification of the right has not actually been able to ensure that a citizen enjoys this right in full. In fact it has been even worse than a country that has not codified the right at all. This is true of the worlds most powerful nation, the USA, where an increasing number of gun shootings at innocent civilians took place at recent times. The right to life is the first listed item on the USAs Bill of Independence. However, in Sri Lanka, though such right to life has not been documented in the list of fundamental rights, such gun shootings are comparatively rare in occurrence. Possession of a weapon is itself a criminal offense under the Penal Code unless a valid license is presented which is yet not a commonality. The difference is that America legally protects it as a right to keep and bear arms on the ground of self-defense whereas in reality such gun usage has been a threat to the populaces right to life than for self-defense.
Thus, as can be seen the interpretation of the content of this right is rather a complex one. It even overlaps at times with its rival notion as in the case of permitting to bear a gun on the basis of self-defense whereas it has an equal possibility of producing the counter effect of being used to cause harm and death. However, the absence of a gun to be used for self-defense has not been a cause of the increasing death rate in any country which does not expressly follow such right either. On the other hand, countries like Sri Lanka with no such right in their constitutions seem to have guaranteed the same in rather indirect ways.
As stated, Sri Lanka does not expressly recognize the right to life in its list of fundamental rights. However, it implicitly recognizes this through other fundamental rights that are set out in Chapter III of the Constitution. Article 11 of the Constitution states that no person shall be subject to torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Article 13 (2) provides that any person may not be held in custody, detained or otherwise be deprived of personal liberty.
Article 17 provides for the right to apply to the Supreme Court in respect of any such infringement. In this way, the law has safeguarded life and does not typically permit deprivation of life except in situations restricted only to justified deprivation as in the case of self-defense or where it is by way of an order of court.

Right route
He has been the voice for the youth for a considerable span. Spearheading The Road to Rights, a youth led organization Ashan Perera reached yet another milestone when he bagged the Peoples Choice Award for the year 2018 of UN SDG Action Awards at the Global Festival of Action for Sustainable Development organized by the UN SDG Action Campaign with the support of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and the German Federal Foreign Office. The event recognizes the most outstanding and innovative efforts to inspire actions on the Sustainable Development Goals declared by the United Nations.
Considered as the worlds most inspiring SDG event to celebrate, empower, and connect the global community driving action for sustainable development goals the festival brings together the local community taking action to make these goals a reality.
More than 1500 youth from around the world took part in the event which was held in Bonn city, Germany from March 21 to 23. The Road to Rights competed against 125 countries and 746 nominations to clinch the award.
My parents came from humble beginnings. We lived in Piliyandala. I was the youngest of three. I was brought up to respect and nurture the values of all, a tendency that is rarely found in the world today. Being different from the average child, my intention was always to find ways to contribute towards others. Upholding such values started in my home, where three deprived children born to our domestic helpers would wait for us to return home from school to engage in play and conversation. By eight years I was my ability to lead motivated me to start a small club named United Children Association. Inspired by competitive programs such as the Olympic Games we would create our own events and games that would culminate with award ceremonies, where the distribution of certificates cut out of milk powder packs and homemade medals made out of cans and metal bottle tops took place. The success of such events led up to setting up of a library which was open to neighbours, both young and old. They were encouraged to bring their own reading material to be read or exchanged with each other. This event was titled Association of Neighbors. These are the tinny buds of joy I had then which I never thought I would be the person whom I am today. Yet these tiny acts of kindness made me come a long way. My mission began there and there has been no turning back. Inviting friends and friends of friends, connecting with other schools, both public and international to discuss and research the path to Human Rights & SDGs initiated The Road to Rights, Ashan recalled.
He says that the vision behind The Road to Rights is to create an environment where each one of us understands and respects the rights of our neighbours. We all co-exist in harmony through a human-rights based approach.
We stand for incorporating human rights for the sustainable future, simply to create a society where we love each other, care for each other and respect everyones independence, he explained.
Filled with diverse young passionate youth from Sri Lanka and around the world, The Road to Rights comprises 18 chapters across the globe. All their volunteers are unique in one way or the other. They are passionate and trust in the organisations core vision for a better future.
We are mainly working with schools and higher educational institutes to conduct seminars, workshop and capacity building sessions to empower youth and children. We also believing in using tools to create awareness and empower people so that we have initiatives using art, sport and ICT as powerful tools for peace and development, he stressed.
An old boy of Piliyandala Central College and Royal College, Colombo, Ashan says that he has learnt many life lessons from his background. His father is a mechanic and a businessman. His mother is a housewife.
Ashan opines that the most crucial issue that the Sri Lankan youth are suffering from today is youth employment.
Youth is an important part of the economic, political, and social development in Sri Lanka. The country boasts of high achievements in education, including gender equality in primary and secondary school enrollments and more than 90 percent literacy rates among both women and men. Yet only a very few percent of those who qualify for higher education are actually admitted to universities. The unemployment rates among such youth are roughly double the national unemployment rate, he said.
Inclusive and quality education is one of the key challenges in our society which has also led to issues like youth unemployment, lack of youth participation, their inability to cater to skills-based employment etc.
He notes that education is not only about providing the knowledge. Education is about knowledge, skills and attitudes.
It has to be a part of the education system in Sri Lanka. That is the only way that we can empower and develop right midgets and skills of young people to fit into to this challenging world. Bringing the full potential of the youth will also be the answer to the existing inequities among them, Ashan pointed out.
He says that the biggest challenge he has faced is in getting the support of the authorities and policy makers to share the same goals and vision.
We as young people are the largest generation that the world has ever seen today. It is very important to increase the participation of young people in the policy and decision-making process to create a better, inclusive and sustainable future, he expressed.
Queried on what he enjoys most about his work and Ashan says that the satisfaction of touching many peoples life in his own unique manner cannot be measured in words.
It is inspiring to meet many young people from around the country and other parts of the world. Their stories, passion to create change, and commitment are truly wonderful, he mused.
Winning the Peoples Choice Award for the year 2018 is a milestone in Ashans life.
He says, More than 700 nominations were there, and each story is as unique as ours. On top of that we managed to reach the finals with fewer resources while other contestant had many more supporting grounds. However we had a strong team that believed we deserve the chance to tell our story. The path was not smooth. Went though many rough patches but finally the hard work all paid off.
Ashan has done further studies at the University of Colombo, Bandaranaike International Diplomatic Training Institute (BIDTI), and the Institute of Personnel Management (IPM). He is currently reading for LLB at the University of London.
He adds that The Road to Rights has become a large volunteer network today.
It is one of my goals to establish The Road to Rights as a proper global institution to strengthen all the youth-led initiatives in Sri Lanka as well as other parts of the world. After finishing my current commitments in education, I would like to further my studies by pursuing a PhD in the future. I look forward to serving my country in the best way possible, he said.
The Road to Rights will be launching their chapters in European countries soon. They are preparing to promote sustainable development goals and human rights education in innovative ways. They will celebrate the 70th anniversary of Human Rights in December by organizing their annual Peace Expo, a non-profit fair where youth-led organizations and community based initiatives will come together.
Life is not simple as we see it but if you think that you are going through a lot in life, then around the world in some corner there is a person going through more than what you are going through now. Appreciate what you have. Think wisely before taking action. Respect the uniqueness you have and try not to be some other person. Be who you are and achieve what you want to be, he concluded with a smile.

Royal wins Bradby Shield four in a row
Royal proved there is intelligence and strength in their rugby by taking Trinity to the brink in their second meeting of this years Bradby second leg played at Pallekele. Class and experience will tell every time in any game, from what was seen last on Saturday in the second of the annual Bradby Shield rugby fixtures, Royal had both. They won both games comfortably.
This match was one of the best schools games seen at this venue this season. From the word go the boys went at it like men possessed. It was indeed a rousing match. It left the large crowd very satisfied.
Hundreds of Royal fanatics walked out of Pallekele grounds happily, after their favourite school gave off a good performance to beat Trinity in a hard fought game 27-19. With the win Royal made it four in a row and the tally now stands at TCK 39 wins, RC 33 and 2 Ties.
It was a solid win for Royal in what was a very enjoyable game, even if Trinity couldnt quite go the distance. Trinity had a very good second half, but will rue a few silly defensive errors (dont buy dummies). The rain which came down before the kickoff made conditions slippery in the first quarter. Later the weather was superb for rugby.
Royal who are in the top of the Division I, at the end of the first round, scored their fifth win in a row. They put in a lot of effort and copped a lot of grief and gave it everything, the proudest would have been the Royal head coach for the effort they put in.
Trinity in this game owned possession for much of the second half. They rode the tackles, found a way to continue under immense pressure and built their game, but the match winning luck eluded them. It was a sign of how good a team they have become - composed and resilient as well as skilled and intelligent.
In this game Royal had the edge on Trinity. They had a heavier pack, and their back line went in for short, crisp, passes, the sort of passes that the forwards could join in on  and they often did. These things made Trinitys job tough. In the first half Royal had more of the exchanges and in the second half Trinity dominated. This made the match a most exciting one.
In terms of physique, both schools were equal, and Royal and Trinity were in good form. Trinity made a great impact, though they lost, they were good in ball handling; they had the power and knowledge of rugby, but failed to drive home the advantage. For Royal the victory was a well-earned one where the entire team should be proud of the performance.
C.E. Simithrachchi trophy under 18
Royal who won the first leg in Colombo scored a splendid win over Trinity 13 points to 8 in their Simithrachchi trophy 2nd leg rugger match played at Pallekele and hour before the senior game. It was a rousing game and one of the best under 18 matches seen.
At half time Royal led 8-3. It was Royal forwards who won them the match., They were outstanding in the loose play, getting behind the ball fast and tackling well. Their bustling game completely upset the Trinity forwards who could not win the ball however hard they tried. Royal halves worked well, scrum half slinging out his passes accurately and standoff opening out the game on the defensive.
Under 16
Trinity under 16 rugger fifteen who lost the first leg to Royal 19-21, lost the 2nd too 0-10. In this leg Trinity gave one of their best performances for the season although beaten. Royal were exceptional in the first half, with the help of a penalty to lead 3-0 at half-time.
The Royal three-quarters were far superior to the Trinity in attack. The losers back division made up for this defect to some extent by resolute tackling. The line-outs and scrums were even. The losing teams fly half, made plenty of opening for his line, but the insides were far too slow, with the result was that their wing threes were always bottled up.
Presentation
The 1981 Trinity College rugby skipper Ravi Bandaranayake was the chief guest at the event and handed the Bradby Shield and the Simithrachchi Cup to the two Royal captains - Shabith Feroze and Migara Mithushanka.
Before the kickoff Bandaranayake was introduced to both teams and match officials. Associated with him were the two principals, Trinitys Andrew Fowler-Watt and Royals B.A. Abeyaratne. POG Trinity Shane de Silva and Royals SGM M.A.M. Riyaz were also present.
It was nice to see some politicians of the two schools at the match, the 1968-69 Royal scrum half Malik Samarawickrema, Ravi Karunanayake, Faiszer Mustapha and Sarath Amunugama, all of whom enjoyed the rugby.

Making the winding up speech on the Judicature Amendment Bill in Parliament yesterday, the minister said there is no preferential treatment to anybody before the law under this Government, unlike in the previous administration.
There were accusations of a Bond scam. Two persons are now behind bars in connection with that and the case is being heard. Could anybody expect a similar dispensing of law under the previous regime.
The Opposition submitted seven petitions against this Bill and it seems they fear the move to set up a permanent High Court at Bar to expedite the cases of large scale corruption and financial crimes. We are not targeting any individual or a group through this Bill. It is not a political witch-hunt against anybody. We are simply trying to expedite the cases by this move, Minister Athukorala explained.
We have made the necessary amendments to the Bill in line with the Supreme Court ruling. The new court would expedite the hearing of the backlog of cases, she added.

Schools to close for Asian Games in Indonesia
JAKARTA, Wednesday: Jakarta will close schools across the city during the Asian Games, organisers said Wednesday, in a bid to clear streets of notorious traffic congestion that threatens to create travel chaos.
With just over three months to go until the showpiece event, Games organisers have been looking at ways to tackle the Indonesian capitals traffic snarls.
It was not immediately clear how many schools would be closed during the August 18-September 2 event, which will see 15,000 athletes and hordes of spectators coming to Jakarta and co-host Palembang on Sumatra island.
Taking pupils out of their daily ride to and from school is expected to reduce traffic by about 20 percent, organisers said.
But primary and secondary students delighted by a free pass to skip school will find some strings attached -- theyll be required to write papers about the event at home, or possibly help out as volunteers at the second-biggest multi-sport event behind the Olympics.
This is an opportunity for us ... to get the younger generation involved in the Asian Games and it will reduce the traffic by nearly 20 percent, Games chief organiser Erick Thohir told an organising committee meeting on Wednesday. Organisers plan to create dedicated lanes for athletes and officials to ensure they reach events on time.
Jakarta may also expand an existing odd-even licence plate system to keep a lid on traffic, Thohir added.
The moves are expected to help cut drive times between an athlete village in North Jakarta and the main sporting venue in central Senayan district to 30 minutes from the current trip of almost two hours.
The closure could help reduce choking smog -- much of it from vehicle exhaust -- that can envelop Jakarta, a city of some 10 million.
But not everyone thinks closing schools is the best way to ease congestion.
There are other problems in the city such as street food vendors who sell on the roads or construction projects which hinder peoples mobility, transportation analyst Danang Parikesit told AFP earlier.  AFP

Singapore-SL yoy trade up to $1.4 bn
Sri Lankas newest Free Trade partner in the world, itself a major economic hub, hinted its ambitions to leverage the new Sri Lankan economic partnership as a springboard towards the rising South Asian market.
Many Singapore businesses see Sri Lanka as a gateway to South Asia announced President of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry (SCCCI) Roland Ng yesterday in Colombo. SCCCI has 5,000 corporate members and more than 160 association members, who in turn represent over 40,000 companies across various industries. President Roland is in Colombo leading a 30-man Singaporean business delegation to Sri Lanka. Among the delegation are both listed and unlisted (but well established) firms. Also joining the evening was Shamil Mendis, President of the Sri Lanka-Singapore Business Council.
Singapore Companies can share their experience, insight and know-how with their Lankan counterparts. Due to their own business approach and practices gained in the overseas market. This is not a case of one-sided change and interaction. Started in 1906, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry (SCCCI) is the apex business chamber of the Chinese Community in Singapore.
With these connections and network, we can help to link up business opportunities abroad with Spore companies. We partner with our government agencies to organise many initiatives, activities for our member companies. This is to transform, and improve their capacities to spread overseas.
This approach helps for Singaporean businessman to get to know well about Sri Lanka before coming here on business. SCCCI always played a role of introducing opportunities to Singapore businesses.Last year, Sri Lanka-Singapore total bilateral trade was at US $ 1.4 billion, surging from 2016s $1.1 billion. The trade balance is in favour of Singapore at a 5.3 import to export ratio. Despite this, year on year exports have more than doubled last year-from 2016s $108 million to $221 million in 2017.
Analysts say that SLSFTA is Sri Lankas first Free Trade Agreement that covers government procurement, and Singaporean enterprises can bid for Lankan projects.

Sixteen SLFP MPs who left Govt., to create strong alliance against UNP: SB
Former Minister S.B. Dissanayake in a special statement said yesterday, that the 16 SLFP MPs who left the government, would contribute to create a strong alliance against the United National Party together with all parties in the Opposition.
Dissanayake also said that these 16 SLFP MPs would back the Opposition in any justifiable fight against the government, while working in support of any government endevour, which would be beneficial to the people.
Speaking of the cross over, Dissanayake said that they believed that it was appropriate to sit in the Opposition, since they had voted in favour of the no confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
We worked in support of the no confidence motion. However, PM Wickremesinghe proved that he still got the confidence of the House. So it is only but proper and democratic for us to sit in the Opposition and allow him to continue with the government, Dissanayake said.
He also said that their loss of confidence against the Prime Minister, is mainly due to the Central Bank Treasury Bond issue that severely affected the economy of the country.
Dissanayake also said that all Opposition party leaders, welcomed them and extended their fullest support. Dissanayake also thanked the Speaker of the House for immediate seating arrangement for the 16 SLFP MPs who crossed over.
Meanwhile in his speech, Dissanayake raised his concerns over a statement made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the May Day rally with regards to an absence of Rs 67.5 mn belonging to the Samurdhi Social Protection Fund.
Dissanayake while pointing out that it was a serious allegation, urged that an investigation be expedited on the matter. This allegation affects both the Samurdhi Social Protection Fund as well as the Ministry of Social Empowerment and Welfare. Even if 675 cents belonging to the Samurdhi fund had disappeared, it is a serious issue. So I urged for an immediate investigation on the matter. I am not trying to put the blame on anybody else. I am ready to take responsibility as the Minister who held the portfolio at that time, Dissanayake said.

Sri Lanka posed to create  more entrepreneurs- Finance Minister
Sri Lankas economy demonstrated time tested resilience in 2017, despite the brunt of extreme weather conditions and other adverse external factors. The country recorded its highest ever FDI inflows and the highest ever export performance.
These led to meaningful job creation as the unemployment rate also declined to 4.2%. We expect the economy to accelerate growth driven by private enterprise and exports, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
Speaking at the annual sessions of the Asian Development Bank in Manila last Saturday, he said, We have introduced some key reforms including the new Inland Revenue Act, which came to force last month that could be called the most progressive tax reform in Sri Lanka in several decades. This is part of a broader agenda of introducing transparent rules based legislative and governance frameworks. Our Active Liability Management Act was made effective with a view to improve domestic and foreign debt management. The rules based and transparent auction mechanism for government securities was introduced in the same vein. We are at the doorstep of becoming an upper-middle income country and your continued support to accommodate the desired transition without any hindrance to our national development agenda would be immensely appreciated.
With an ever active ADB resident mission established in 1997, over US $ 8.5 billion project and policy based active loans, grants and technical assistance since 1968, reaching over 500 projects, Sri Lankas ADB portfolio remains robust and active. Our interactions span mainly from the Transport Sector, Energy to Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development. I fervently hope that our national priorities and expectations have an attentive hearing in this august assembly that evolves for greater mutual benefit, he said.
Minister Samaraweera also emphasised on the governments efforts on creating an entrepreneur based economy. The government has been unequivocally promoting an inclusive growth trajectory for Sri Lanka in a knowledge based, highly competitive social market economy with a vision to become a rich country by 2025.
The budget 2018 has proposed to offer a package of concessional credit schemes empowering young entrepreneurs, women, and the differently abled in the country within the theme of Enterprise Sri Lanka. We wish to reawaken our nations entrepreneurial spirit and to regain its rightful place as a vibrant trading hub in the Indian Ocean. Your theme here at the ADB today stands a matching tribute to those domestic policies embedded in our core values ranging from inclusive growth, good governance, and empowering the private sector as the engine of growth.
Sri Lanka has been working hand in hand with the ADB for over half a century that I can describe as a robust partnership in empowering our people to achieve sustainable development. This years meeting theme Linking People and Economies for Inclusive Development resolves to strengthen the ADBs founding vision to create a poverty free Asia and the Pacific.

For the first time in Sri Lanka, STR Global a world leader in providing statistics and data will be opening their operation in Sri Lanka next month in association with Grow Sri Lanka Investment and Exports Development National Programme at WTC.
This is mainly to gather special economic data and other investment opportunities and present it to the global investors who are looking at investing in Sri Lanka.
Dr. Prabath Ukwatta founder Grow Sri Lanka Investment & Exports Development National Programme said that today most of the government enterprises only updates news but not data. Even the web sites of top government institutions that are there to woo foreign investors to Sri Lanka are not updated in the few years.
The Director from STR Global in USA, Jesper Palmqvis was in Sri Lanka for the Asia Hotel and Tourism Investment Conference (AHTIC) in November which was organized by Founder Grow Sri Lanka Investment and Exports Development National Programme and then I proposed him to open an office in Sri Lanka to fill this void.
He agreed also signed up with Lanka Property Club to be the local partner.
Founded in 1985, STRs presence has expanded to 16 countries, with a corporate North American headquarters in Hendersonville, Tennessee, an international headquarters in London, England and an Asia Pacific headquarters in Singapore. STR is the source for premium global data bench marking, analytics and marketplace insights.
Any investor first takes a look at the country data and when does not find sufficient information he is disappointed and may even look at other options in other countries. Today E information is a key area and sadly government institutions dont think in that manner.
He said what the public web sites have is news about their activities and not data. Its to bridge this gap that I negotiated with STR Global to open their operation in Sri Lanka and they will provide there service free of charge.
He said that STR Global is already in India and Singapore and they have a lot of customers both local and foreign.
Dr. Ukwatta also said that he had also signed up with TARSCH CONSULTING in UK which is a concluding, adverting and promotions arm. The prime objective of this is to promote FDI to Sri Lankan and also increase the brand image of Sri Lanka.
They too would be opening in Colombo next month and both these initiatives were endorsed by President Maithripala Sirisena.
Dr Ukwatte said that President has also implied that more efforts are need to woo FDI to Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka brand image too has to be enhanced.
He also said that the first Grow Sri Lanka awards ceremony will be held on November 9 at Colombo Hilton honoring all Exporters both local and BOI companies.
This will be in association with the Export Development Board and Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.

Newspapers associated with either the Reformists or the Principlists, widely seen as the two main political camps in the country, on Wednesday ran headlines condemning the Tuesday decision by US President Donald Trump.
Students from different universities in Tehran were gathering in front of the former US embassy building to protest Washingtons failure to fulfill its commitment under the agreement.
The protesters were condemning the United States' hostile attitude towards the Iranian nation and its lack of commitment vis--vis the country on numerous occasions, Tasnim news agency said.
We will proceed towards a bright future with or without sanctions, the headline on the daily Ettelaat hearemark said, quoting President Hassan Rouhani.
Kayhan paper, which is largely viewed as a Principlist daily, said, Trump tore up the JCPOA, it is time [for us] to burn it, referring to the 2015 agreement by its official name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
Etemad, a reformist paper, and Iran wrote, The nuclear deal without the interloper, referring to the US.
Wide-circulation Hamshahri wrote, The JCPOA stayed. The US left, while Arman-e Emrouz republished a remark made by the European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, who had said earlier that the bloc would keep honoring the deal.
Wide-circulation Hamshahri papers headline for May 19, 2018 reads, The JCPOA stayed. The US left.
The JCPOA was signed between Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- the US, the UK, France, Russia, and China -- plus Germany. It removed nuclear-related sanctions on Tehran in exchange for restrictions on Irans nuclear program in certain aspects.
Trump, who had been threatening to pull out of the accord since his inauguration last January, including by warning to tear up the deal, announced Washingtons withdrawal from the agreement on Tuesday.
Other signatories to the deal, as well as the United Nations and the EU had warned Washington against any bid to sabotage it. They call the JCPOA a pillar of regional and international peace and stability, and reiterate the multilateral pact cannot be simply terminated by a single party.
Only hours after the move was announced, Iranian students and some lawmakers took to Azadi Square in the capital, setting fire to American flags and shouting anti-US slogans.
The students called on the government to counter the US decision by leaving the accord.
MP Hossein Naqavi Hosseini said, On the back of unity between the people and authorities, we will deliver such a response to the Americans that will make them regret [their decision]."
"The US showed that it does not commit to international regulations, said the lawmaker who is also the spokesman for Parliaments Committee on National Security and Foreign Policy.
All countries should beware of the possibility of Washingtons reneging on its promises, the MP added. - PRESS TV

Vista Rooms continues strong  growth in Sri Lanka
The expansion will solidify Vista Rooms presence in Sri Lanka after having entered the market in 2016. This latest move comes on the back of Sri Lankas continued growth inpopularity as a holiday destination among international travellers. In 2017 Sri Lanka reached an all-time high of 2,116,407 tourist arrivals. That stellar trend continued into the new year with double digit year-on-year growth
Vista Rooms, South Asias largest chain of affordable stays, is expanding its operations in the East coast of Sri Lanka following a wave of success in the Western, Central and Southern regions of the country. With a current inventory of 50 rooms in the East, the hospitality startup is expected to grow to over 200 rooms before the end of the year.
The expansion will solidify Vista Rooms presence in Sri Lanka after having entered the market in 2016. This latest move comes on the back of Sri Lankas continued growth inpopularity as a holiday destination among international travellers. In 2017 Sri Lanka reached an all-time high of 2,116,407 tourist arrivals. That stellar trend continued into the new year with double digit year-on-year growth.
Commenting on this new focus Amit Damani, Co-Founder of Vista Rooms, said, Traditionally there has been a strong focus on tourism in the West and South of the country. However, as Sri Lanka continues to invest in the tourism industry and reach towards its vision of being identified as a place for memorable, authentic and diverse experiences, we believe the East will see greater growth in tourist numbers. This will likely be bolstered by further investment in infrastructure that makes the East more easily accessible.
In less than two years we have become operationally profitable and in the past year alone we have grown 10 fold. We see a bright and prosperous future for tourism in Sri Lanka and our investments in the East coast will help secure Vista Rooms place in that future, he added.
Vista Rooms goes beyond increasing monthly revenues for their partners, by taking care of the entire guest lifecycle and improving day-to-day operations. Regular audits of each property guarantees a standardised experience for all guests  their average review score of over 7/10 on Booking.com is a testament of this focus on excellent guest experience. With access to the Vista Rooms preferred vendors, their partners source their supplies at lower rates and thereby, reduce their maintenance costs considerably.
Recently, Vista Rooms, identifying a surge in popularity in the informal sector, began providing complete turnkey solutions for the private stays segment. They offer end to end support to villa and apartment owners  right from tech, to sales, to regulatory and operational support.Having already tied up with over 50 apartments and villas across the island the company has begun providing an off the beaten path experience to tourists.
Since entering the Sri Lankan market Vista Rooms has been successful in quickly capturing market share and building the largest network of branded stays in the country with over 350 properties across 30 cities. The same swift growth can be expected from the brand going forward, as they begin catering to a large, untapped demand segment.

China to firmly uphold  economic globalization
Ambassador of China Cheng Xueyuan, has reaffirmed that China firmly upholds economic globalization which brings great benefits to the whole world including China and Sri Lanka.
The Chinese side is committed to promote Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with relevant countries through joint consultation, contribution and shared benefits, so as to build a community of shared future for mankind. These sentiments were expressed by the Chinese Ambassador when he called upon Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to exchange views on the economic globalization and joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Sri Lanka.
Ambassador Cheng reiterated that China attaches great importance to its relations with Sri Lanka, and stands ready to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, so as to actively push forward the practical cooperation under the framework of BRI, and bring tangible benefits to the two countries and peoples.

Miles to go before I sleep
May Day in Sri Lanka always has political connotations and is an opportunity for the major political parties to showcase their strength. Despite the traditional May 1 holiday being postponed, this year was no different with the United National Party (UNP), the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and its offshoot, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) jostling for pole position.
In the context of recent political developments such as the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the decision of sixteen SLFPers to sit on the opposition benches and the reforms in the UNP, this weeks May Day celebrations had added significance in hinting what could lie ahead for the major parties.
The mainstream SLFP headed by President Maithripala Sirisena held their rally in Chenkalady, Batticaloa in a departure from their usual tradition of staging celebrations in Colombo. The rally was well attended and all parliamentarians loyal to the President participated.
Also attending the rally was former Minister Sumedha G. Jayasena who was among the group of sixteen who voted for the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and subsequently quit the government. Her presence at Batticaloa led to speculation that she has reverted to supporting President Sirisena and that the group of sixteen had now become the group of fifteen. However, Jayasena is yet to formally comment on her stance.
Even more significant was a statement by President Sirisena at the rally. He stated that he would not retire from politics by 2020. This is an obvious reference to the next presidential elections which are due by January that year. The reason, President Sirisena said, was because he had many more goals to achieve and his task as President was only half finished.
The country does not need corrupt politicians. There are no political leaders who love the people. Some dream of forming a government in 2020. We will support a programme which promotes reconciliation, President Sirisena was reported to have said.
SLFPs presidential candidate in 2020
Previously, while campaigning for the Presidency in 2015, President Sirisena had stated that he would not run for President again, a pledge repeated several times after assuming office, most notably at the funeral of Maduluwave Sobhitha Thera in November 2015.
For some time, there has been speculation about the Presidents intentions for 2020, fuelled further by his recent inquiry from the Supreme Court to determine whether his tenure ended in 2020 or 2021. The Supreme Court affirmed it was the former. Since then, several frontline SLFP ministers have been declaring that President Sirisena would be the SLFPs presidential candidate in 2020 but the President has remained silent on the issue.
It should be noted that even on Monday, what the President said was that he would not retire from politics by 2020 and that he did not state that he would run again for the Presidency, though this appears to be the most plausible conclusion to draw from these comments.
If that is indeed the Presidents intention, that would rule out any possibility of a rapprochement between the mainstream SLFP and the SLPP of which former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is the de-facto leader. Therefore the significance of the Presidents statement was not lost on Rajapaksa.
Addressing the SLPPs own well attended May Day rally in Galle, Rajapaksa attempted to pooh-pooh President Sirisenas comments. The President has to make such statements to retain parliamentarians loyal to him, Rajapaksa argued.
Although the SLPPs rally was reportedly well attended, if it had hoped to send the mainstream SLFP a message by roping in some parliamentarians from the group of sixteen, it would have been disappointed because none of them attended the Galle rally.
Despite widespread expectation that the group of sixteen would eventually shift their loyalties to the SLPP because they believe that would enhance their chances of re-election, it is now clear that with many months more before the national elections, the majority in this group wish to keep their options open. It is also acknowledged that some in the group- such as former ministers Susil Premajayantha and Dayasiri Jayasekara- are more inclined to join Rajapaksa while others- such as former Minister John Seneviratne- wish to pursue a more neutral stance.
If the SLFP and the SLPP had their fair share of conveying political messages to each other, the UNP rally was not without its own drama. The rally of the main constituent party in government was held at Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium in Colombo, a day ahead of the other rallies.
That too was a departure from its usual practice as the rally was confined to a closed venue and there was no procession in the lead up to it. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe alluded to the recent reforms in the party and also declared that the Samurdhi Bank would be brought under the purview of the Central Bank, a comment which drew a retort from S. B. Dissanayake, who was the minister in charge of the Samurdhi movement until recently. Dissanayake said he would resist such a move.
SLPPs next presidential candidate
Making his presence felt at the rally was UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa. Premadasa pledged to work towards the election of a UNP President and a UNP government at the next elections. He also recalled that his father, Ranasinghe Premadasa had many differences of opinion with his leader J. R. Jayewardene but always remained loyal to Jayewardene like his shadow. He too has learnt that lesson and would follow in his fathers footsteps in remaining loyal to his leader, Premadasa said.
The UNPs newly appointed National Organiser Navin Dissanayake acknowledged that the UNP had suffered a setback at the local; council elections and that the SLPP was making inroads into its vote base. Dissanayake also alluded to speculation about a tussle between the Rajapaksa siblings- Chamal, Gotabhaya and Basil- to be the SLPPs next presidential candidate.
Of more concern to the UNP would be the absence of many stalwarts from the May Day rally. Among those who were conspicuous by their absence were Chairman Kabir Hashim, Assistant Leader Ravi Karunanayake and other stalwarts including Palitha Range Bandara, Ashoka Abeysinghe, Wasantha Senanayake, Hirunika Premachandra, Chaminda Wijeysiri, Ranjan Ramanayake, Daya Gamage, Sujeewa Senasinghe, Mayantha Dissanayake and Edward Gunasekara, Dr. Harsha de Silva, Malik Samarawickrema, Sagala Ratnayaka, Ranjit Aluvihare and Chathura Senaratne.
The UNP, in a subsequent statement, clarified the absences of some of the MPs stating that they were either overseas or unable to attend due to other personal reasons. Obviously, some of the absentees are close loyalists of UNP leader and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and would have had no intention of embarrassing him.
However, there is speculation that the absences of some others were due to recent party reforms not meeting their aspirations. Among them, parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra has been outspoken, communicating her dissatisfaction in numerous interviews with the media. It remains to be seen whether Premachandra will be taken to task with disciplinary action taken against her or whether the party would adopt a more conciliatory damage control option.
It is clear from what transpired on May Day that all the major parties are in somewhat of a state of flux, with national elections looming in about one and a half years. The mainstream SLFP is desperate to recover from the drubbing it received at the local council elections and the defection of the group of sixteen. The SLPP, despite its recent successes, has to identify a presidential candidate and gear itself for elections and the UNP has to deal with internal dissent. Interesting times, no doubt, are ahead.

Opposition National List SLFP MPs should resign
Sri Lanka Freedom Party Young Professionals Association (SLFPYPA) Executive Member Rajika Kodithuwakku yesterday stressed that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) National List MPs who left the Government recently and took their seats in the Opposition in Parliament, should resign.
He was addressing the media yesterday at the SLFP Headquarters.
Kodithuwakku said the President gave seven out of the 12 allocated National List seats to SLFP candidates who lost in the General Election held in August 2015 expecting their collaboration to continue his tasks. SLFP National List MPs who ignored the President should resign from their MP posts, he said.
Kodituwakku also stressed that Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka should resign from the Ministerial post since he has no ethical right to hold that position while criticizing the President.
Before making such statements, Field Marshal should recall the past. President Maithripala Sirisena is the person who granted full Presidential pardon to Sarath Fonseka and promoted him to the rank of Field Marshal, he said. He added that President Sirisena is the most eligible candidate for the Presidential Election to be held in 2020.
President Sirisena has already fulfilled 90 percent of the pledges made to the public during the Presidential election campaign, he added. Kodithuwakku said there is no need to cut the powers vested with the Executive Presidency further or abolish the Executive Presidency since the mandate was given to slash certain powers and the President has already done that.
SLFPYPA Executive Member Malik Perera was also present.

SIVILIMA i-Homes to open in Maldives
With the lasting objective of interlinking Sivilima showroom chain with the international market, the IDEA Group has intended to establish a network of showrooms branded as i-Homes in foreign countries. As the very first step of this successful journey, i-Home showroom network is to be set up in Maldives.
Senior Managers of Idea Group of Companies recently entered into a business contract in Colombo with a leading building materials marketing company in Maldives to set up i-Homes showroom in Maldives. According to this business agreement, all products of Idea Group including i-Roof and i-Panel will be traded in Maldives.
In the next few months, i-Homes showrooms are planned to be open in many countries including Ghana, Malavi, Madagascar and Egypt.
i-Roof manufacturing under the theme of Roof with the highest benefits is the only ASA polymer roofing tile produced in Sri Lanka with the ISO 9001:2015 international standard certification. i-Roof is a green product which does not contain Lead (Pb) or asbestos in its composition and is considered as the best solution for Sri Lankan roofing requirements.
In estimates made by building constructers on fixing the roof, i-Roof contributes to the lowest cost per square foot that include; fixing the frame, using heat resisters and fixture of thatching sheets.
Commenting on the sale of all products of Idea Group including i-Roof and i-Panel in Maldives, the CEO/Managing Director of Idea Group Limited Mr. Sampath Mayakaduwa proudly said that the Idea Group has entered to a new phase with this venture.

After securing the largest market share in the country we aimed at entering the export market.
i-Roof product perfectly blends with diverse climatic conditions in Sri Lanka and offers 25% more benefits to the valued customers as against normal roofing tiles and other thatching sheets in the marketplace.
In 2012, Idea group diversified its business periphery to unveil SIVILIMA network of showrooms. Within a short period of five years, SIVILIMA became a top-of-the-mind brand and a household name.
Being a socially responsible business, SIVILIMA provides domestic and commercial markets in the country with an array of green-oriented products. Technical plans of SIVILIMA product range owning 42 Patent licenses are significant.

Voters gave a warning signal to the UNP as well as the SLFP at the last election. If we fail to learn a lesson from that signal they will send us home at the next election without any other warning, Anuradhapura District UNP Parliamentarian Ishak Rahuman said.
He was addressing a meeting to mark the inauguration of rehabilitation work on the playground at the Katukeliyawa Muslim Primary School yesterday.
Rahuman said the people voted the yahapalanaya government to power with great faith and expectations. The President, Prime Minister and other Ministers and Parliamentarians alleged that some of their own party members were preventing them from doing service to the people. Sixteen members who resorted to that tactic had now left the government.
Rahuman said he would make one request from the President: to develop schools and roads in Anuradhapura district with equal emphasis as he gave the Polonnaruwa district, since he was considered the undisputed leader of Raja Rata.
He said the government had another two years to complete its tenure. We could march forward and win the next election too, if we act fast to fulfil the election pledges held out to the people, during the balance term.

## Title: 7 tips for clean eating
## Supertitle:

## Date: Thursday, May 10, 2018 - 01:00
7 tips for clean eating
1. Load Up On Produce
When it comes to fruits and vegetables, most of us arent getting enough. Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 76 percent of Americans dont get enough fruit each day and a whopping 87 percent arent eating enough servings of vegetables. Eating more fruit and vegetables can help significantly reduce your risk for a number of chronic diseases, including high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obesity and cancer.

2. Go Whole Grain
The cleanest whole grains are the ones that have been touched the least by processing. Think whole grains that look most like their just-harvested statequinoa, wild rice, oats. While some people abstain from eating any processed grains, we think that whole-wheat pasta and whole-grain bread made with simple ingredients are part of eating clean.

3. Eat Less Meat
More and more research suggests cutting back on meat is healthier for you and the planet. Veganism isnt a requirement for clean eating thoughjust eating less meat can help reduce your blood pressure, reduce your risk of heart disease and help keep your weight in check. Plus, eating more plants helps bump up the fiber, healthy fats and vitamins and minerals in your diet.

4. Watch Out for Processed Foods
Were not opposed to all processed foods. Technically when we chop, mix and cook at home we are processing foods. The trouble is that so much of processed food at the grocery store is processed beyond the point of recognition. Nature certainly didnt color those chips that neon color of orange or make blue candy-colored cereal. Keep an eye out for anything with lots of sugar and refined grains, super-long ingredient lists with foods you dont recognize and anything with partially hydrogenated oils.

5. Limit Sugar
Most people eat too many added sugars. The American Heart Association recommends no more than about 6 teaspoons per day for women and 9 teaspoons per day for men. The average American gets about 4 times that amount28 teaspoons of added sugar per day.
To clean up your diet, cut down on added sugars by limiting sweets like soda, candy and baked goods. But its more than just dessertskeep an eye on sugars added to healthier foods like yogurt (choose plain), tomato sauce and cereal. - eatingwell.com
