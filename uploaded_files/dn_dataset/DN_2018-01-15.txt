Steps underway to upgrade Wilpattus infrastructure
Steps are being taken to upgrade the infrastructural facilities at the Anuradhapuyra Wilpattu National Sanctuary in the line of the Yala Development Project. Wilpattu was declared a national park 80 years ago, in 1938. The sanctuary is bounded to the Anuradhapura, Puttlam, and Mannar districts.
According the Wildlife Department, the Wilpattu sanctuary has earned an income of Rs. 869, 940, 254 in 2017. It was learnt, although the visiting time for sight-seeing in the park had been limited to half day during the period between last June and August, there was no decrease in the numbers of tourists visiting the park. A spokesman of the department said in 2017, the number of tourists visiting the sanctuary was 75,726, including 49,114 local and 26,612 foreign touristswhich is comparably higher than the 2016 intake.
At present, there are eight tourist bungalows on the banks of the lakes of Kokmotai, Mahawila, Manikwila, Thalawila, Panikkawila, Lunuwewa, Mahawewa, and Maradanmaduwa (dormitory nature), where around 130 tourists could get accommodation. In addition, there are two camp sites at Mailawewa and Kokmotai, where only security and water facilities are provided.
According to the Wildlife Department spokesman, it has been proposed to open two more tourist bungalows with additional dormitory accommodation facilities and two new camp sites along the Wilpattu beach, under the development programme. The present strength of staff of 100, including 23 volunteer guides, is also planned to be increased twofold, since the present carders are not adequate to cover the colossal landscape of Wilpattu. Necessary facilities are to be increased for tourists to view large numbers of archaeological sites scattered in the sanctuary, presently covered with a thick jungle, in collaboration with the Archaeological Department.

Stick to your New Years resolutions
New Years resolutions often fail  but now a new study may just provide the motivation for you to stick to them. Scientists found that meeting goals  such as giving up drinking or smoking  can slash your risk of cancerby a third.
The-large scale study  of half a million Britons  looked at the effects of quitting tobacco, limiting alcohol intake, maintaining a low body mass index (BMI), exercising regularly and eating a healthy diet. Each individual behaviour, was found to bring a decrease in the chance of getting cancer of about eight per cent. But carried out all together the overall risk reduction was about a third  and likely a greater cut in deaths from the disease.
Key findings
The researchers from Cardiff University examined data from 343,150 people from the UK Biobank to identify the five healthy behaviours and compare them to the risk of cancer. The subjects were aged 40 to 69 and 14,285 were diagnosed with the disease during an average follow up of just over five years.
The team found that adopting all the studied healthy behaviours brought a 25 and 35 per cent reduction in bowel and breast cancer respectively  two of the most common forms of the disease.
The risk of cancer in the UK population has increased from about 37 per cent for people born in 1930 to around 50 per cent for those born in 1960. The increase is largely due to the increasing age of the population but even after taking this into account cancer rates have risen over the past ten years by 3 per cent in men and 8 per cent in women.
In the UK male population, prostate cancer accounted for 26 per cent and colorectal cancer 13 per cent of all cancers. In the UK female population, breast cancer accounted for 31 per cent and colorectal cancer 10 per cent.
The team said the findings may not sound surprising  but they serve as a reminder of the importance behind turning resolutions into permanent lifestyle choices. Professor Elwood said the real problem for people adopting resolutions is translating the vague idea of lifestyle choices being good into useful evidence  which is what this study provides.
The most popular new years resolutions
According to a recent poll, the most popular New Years resolutions for 2018 are as follows:
1. Eat better
2. Exercise more
3. Spend less money
4. Self care (i.e. get more sleep)
5. Read more books
6. Learn a new skill
7. Get a new job
8. Make new friends
9. Get a new hobby
10. Focus more on appearance
The findings were found by YouGov who surveyed 1,170 UK adults. However, another recent poll by Bupa asked 2,000 people whether they were confident they would stick to their goals  only half thought they would.

Trump: 'I am not a racist'
President Donald Trump defended himself Sunday night after several days of controversy over his remarks about African countries, telling reporters, "I am not a racist."
In remarks to reporters at a dinner photo opportunity with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy in West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump said when asked if he is a racist, "No, I'm not a racist. I am the least racist person you have ever interviewed."
The President has drawn sharp criticism since he was reported to have called African countries "shitholes" while discussing immigration with lawmakers Thursday.
The President also addressed the looming government shutdown when asked if it would happen.
"I don't know if there will be a shutdown, there shouldn't be," he said.
The White House and Democrats in Congress are negotiating an immigration deal as lawmakers face a Friday deadline to pass a federal spending bill and avoid a government shutdown.
DACA talks
Trump said he is "ready and willing to make a deal" on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but he doesn't believe Democrats want to reach an agreement.
"They don't want security at the border," Trump said. "We have people pouring in. They don't want security at the border. They don't want to stop drugs, and they want to take money away from our military, which we cannot do. So those are some of the sticking points."
The President's comments come after he held on-camera bipartisan talks at the White House last week in which he appeared open to making a deal with both Republicans and Democrats. The meeting took place prior to Trump's controversial comments from the Oval Office on Thursday.
North Korea
Asked by reporters if he has spoken to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un following his refusal to answer the question during a Wall Street Journal interview last week, Trump again did not answer the question.
"We're gonna see what happens," he said. "They have a couple of meetings scheduled, a couple of additional meetings scheduled, and we'll see what happens. Hopefully, it's all going to work out. We'll see."
He added: "We're going to see what happens with North Korea. We have great talks going on. The Olympics you know about. A lot of things can happen."

Two bodies switched in Anuradhapura
Two corpses were mistakenly switched by funeral service providers in Anuradhapura.
The corpses of a retired entomologist and a farmer were sent to wrong houses by the funeral service providers on Saturday (13).
The Colombo-Pannipitiya and Kahatagasdigiliya-Mekichchawa funeral service providers mistakenly brought the wrong bodies to the two houses.
One body was identified as that of H.P Nandasena (63), a farmer of Sippikulama, Mihintale. He was admitted to the Anuradhapura Teaching hospita for a heart ailment.
The other was identified as H.A Jayasinghe (90), an entomologist from Colombo, who was staying with a relative in Anuradhapura and died after he was admitted to the hospital.
The two bodies were brought to the hospital mortuary for post-mortems and after conducting the autopsies, the mortuary staff had handed over the dead bodies. The families and the funeral service providers had taken the bodies homes without checking their identities. Having realised that the corpses were switched, the families brought back the corpses to the hospital to get them legally released.

UN Committee on Rights of the Child meets on Jan 15
The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child is meeting in Geneva from January 15 to February 2 to review childrens rights in eight countries including Sri Lanka, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said.
The Committee, which is composed of 18 independent experts, monitors how States that have ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) are complying with their obligations.
During the meetings in Geneva, Committee members will hold question and answer sessions with the respective government delegations. The Committees final evaluation will be based on the written report and replies submitted by the State party, and the information provided supplied by the delegation as well as by other UN bodies and NGOs.
The sessions will be held in Geneva, and will be discussing Sri Lanka on January 15-16.
The United Nations Child Fund (UNICEF) began its work in Sri Lanka in the early 1950s and opened its first country office in the island in 1973. In 2014, the United Nations celebrated 15 years of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the most widely ratified convention in the world. That year, Sri Lanka was applauded for its progress in implementing the principles of the convention.
National indicators on children are very good compared to most nations in the region and to many countries in other predominantly middle income regions.
The legal and policy framework for children is solid and most children enjoy basic services across the country.
There are, of course, areas for improvement but also considerable political will to make those improvements.

Unbelievable places that really exist
Our world is so full of wonders that new and amazing places are discovered every day, be that by professional photographers or amateurs. Different geographical locations, climatic conditions and even seasons offer the widest variety of natural wonders: pink lakes, stunning lavender or tulip fields, breath-taking canyons and mountains, and other places you can hardly believe actually exist!
Some of the pictures in this collection will be of all natural sights you can find while traveling around the world, while the others have experienced human interference  but even in these cases, the result of such collaboration is spectacular. The Japanese learned how to tame thousands of orchids and form a romantic tunnel out of them; another one was formed all the way in Ukraine by a passing train; and what eventually ends up as hot tea in our mugs, first grows in stunning tree fields in Asia.
No wonder that traveling in one of the best forms of recreation  even looking at these pictures takes your mind to far away places And yes, all those of those places are real! Bored Panda

Wigneswaran calls for bigger role in India-assisted NP projects
Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran has sought greater collaboration between the Government of India and his administration in development projects in the province.
We would like to be brought in as an active stakeholder, through the Government of Sri Lanka, in projects being carried out in the Northern Province. At present, they are mostly done unilaterally by the Colombo government, he told The Hindu on Saturday.
The Chief Minister raised the matter at a meeting with the Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, in Colombo on Thursday. We discussed a host of other issues pertaining to the ongoing India-assisted development in the Northern Province, Wigneswaran said.
Sources in the Indian mission said that senior officials had, in the past, sought a clear 'economic plan' from the Northern Chief Minister, mentioning specific projects based on current requirements, especially focussing on people's livelihoods and skills development. They are yet to receive such a proposal. On receiving it, Colombo and New Delhi could discuss possible partnerships, the sources said.
On January 10, the two countries signed an agreement for Indian assistance of US $ 45.27 million to upgrade the Kankesanthurai (KKS) harbour, located on the northern tip of the Jaffna peninsula. The upgrading project, a release from the Indian mission here said, would make the harbour a full-fledged commercial port and also supplement reconstruction efforts in the war-affected north. The agreement came as a positive turn to our request, the Chief Minister said.
Further, he discussed possible development of the Palaly airport into a regional airport, and the revival of ferry services between Dhanushkodi in Tamil Nadus Ramanathapuram district and Talaimannar on Sri Lankas north-western coast. When Sri Lankan refugees return to India, they are unable to bring their belongings collected over 20-30 years on flights that have a limited baggage allowance. A ferry service will help them, he said.
The Northern Provincial Council that Wigneswaran helms, was elected to power five years ago, and he has since raised concern over inadequate powers to govern. On the other hand, critics in the north blame the NPC administration for the lack of sufficient initiative, even within the administrative powers that it currently holds.
Beginning in 2005, the Indian government has committed a total of $ 2.6 billion development assistance to Sri Lanka, focussed mostly on initiatives the north and east. More recently, projects in the South and in Central and Uva Provinces, where hill country Tamils live, have taken off. (The Hindu)

LONDON, Saturday: Wolverhampton Wandererss magisterial progress at the top of the Championship was checked with a goalless draw at Barnsley as their handsome lead was cut to 10 points following Derby Countys 3-0 win at Birmingham City on Saturday.
Wolves extended their unbeaten run in all matches to 14 games but they were left frustrated as Helder Costa and Diogo Jota both had goals ruled out for offside with Jota also hitting the bar.
It left Wolves on 62 points from 27 games with Derby moving up to 52 after Matej Vydras 16th goal of the season and other strikes from Johnny Russell and Andreas Weimann saw Gary Rowetts side defeat his old team comfortably.
Cardiff City, third in the standings on 50 points, ended a four-match losing run to heap more pressure on bottom club Sunderland with a 4-0 victory. All the action unfolded after a goalless first half with a brace from Callum Paterson and other goals from Joe Ralls and Anthony Pilkington heaping more misery on Chris Colemans side, who also had Didier Ndong sent off after the break for a foul.
Bristol City, fresh from a fine performance in defeat to Manchester City in the League Cup semi-final first leg, suffered a setback in their promotion chase when James Maddisons 79th minute goal earned Norwich City a 1-0 win at Ashton Gate.
Aston Villa leapfrogged Bristol City to move into fourth place, with both sides on 47 points, after a 1-0 win at Nottingham Forest in the days late game.

World outrage at Trumps immigration comment
US: US President Donald Trumps vulgar comments to US lawmakers explaining his opposition to Haitian and African migrants has sparked outrage and condemnation at home and abroad.
UN human rights spokesman Rupert Colville called the comments racist. Its about opening the door wider to humanitys worst side, about validating and encouraging racism and xenophobia that will potentially disrupt and destroy the lives of many people, he said.
Trump reportedly said migrants from Africa come from s---hole countries, a remark Democratic Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois confirmed that Trump used during a meeting on immigration.
Friday, the African Union Mission in Washington issued a statement expressing infuriation, disappointment and outrage over the unfortunate statement made by Trump.
The African Union Mission condemns the comments in the strongest terms and demands a retraction of the comment as well as an apology to not only to the Africans but to all people of African descent around the globe, the group said.
The mission said there is a serious need for dialogue between the U.S. administration and the African countries to address the administrations huge misunderstanding of the African continent and its people.
The African National Congress, South Africas ruling party, said Trumps remarks were extremely offensive.
Raoul Peck, a Haitian-born director and former Haitian minister of culture, said he was shocked, appalled and outraged by Trumps remark.
The responsibility of being the president of this great country is not a game nor a reality show, Peck tweeted. It demands basic education, basic insight, a dose of humanity and some intelligence. Trump does not and cannot pass any of these grades.
State Department officials said Friday that American diplomats in Haiti and in Botswana had been summoned by government officials to explain the remarks. Botswana issued a formal statement, seeking clarification on whether the United States truly regards the African country in the derogatory way reported.
Haitis ambassador to the US, Paul G. Altidor, also condemned Trumps remarks.
In the spirit of the people of Haiti we feel in the statements, if they were made, the president was either misinformed or miseducated about Haiti and its people, Altidor said in a written statement.
The State Department confirmed Friday that US Ambassador to Panama John Feeley had stepped down, saying his resignation was in the works for some time. - VOA NEWS

SL has more than 1 mn registered SMEs - Minister Bathiudeen
Implementation of Sri Lankas first national SME strategy began in earnest as the government moved a top global private advisory firm to lead the process.
The implementation of Lankan SME policy is starting with a huge Rs 3.8 mn pilot project in a very short time from its initial national launch last year within five months to be exact.
The Government of Sri Lanka has assigned high priority to the development and strengthening of SME sector to be a sustainable sector of the Country's economy and to link to global markets, said Minister of Industry and Commerce, Rishad Bathiudeen on January 12 in Colombo addressing the launch of Sri Lanka Enabling Environment - SME Legal & Institutional Assessment session, by his Ministry of Industry & Commerce and the National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA) under him in Colombo.
NEDA has signed an MoU with EY Advisory Services, a member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited, as a preparatory step for implementation work of national SME policy launched by his Ministry last year with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinge. Sri Lanka EY Advisory Services has retained Colombos law firm F. J. & G. de Saram for mapping of legal environment related to Lankan SMEs. GIZ in Sri Lanka is the generous funder of this three-month long SME policy implementation start furnishing a huge SL Rs 3.8 million.
We thank GIZ Sri Lanka for supporting our SME sector in this initiative with their huge funding. There are a little more than one million registered SMEs and MSMEs in Sri Lanka. Each provides employment to three people on average especially in rural areas. We believe that SMEs are more than 70% of the total number of enterprises in the economy providing 45% of the employment and contributing to 52% of the Gross Domestic Production (GDP). With the increasing trend of globalization the SME sector has become a driving force for growth and development.
As a result the Government of Sri Lanka has assigned high priority to the development and strengthening of SME sector to be a sustainable sector of the Country's economy and to link to global markets, said Minister Bathiudeen. To achieve this goal, the national SME Policy framework, its action plan and assigning responsibilities are important steps.
Partner of EY Advisory Services, Arjuna Herath said that EY is proud to partner in this national initiative. EY is a global leader in assurance, tax, transactions and advisory services. Locally, we are committed to doing our part in building a better working world for our people, for our clients and for our communities. We believe there is a need to boost Sri Lankan SME sector in a qualitative way and this is a major step in this direction.

Sita Perera
Dedicated music teacher
Music teachers always hold a special place in every student's heart. Sita, you were the most dedicated music teacher I had in my life, and I want to thank you for all your patient efforts and persevering ways in teaching me how to sing and play the piano for nine long years.
As you left us last April, after more than three score and ten years of life, I have to thank you for helping me get through up to my grade four exams. Not only were you a teacher, but you acted like my grandmother and advisor whenever I required it.
You were a teacher I will never forget, who gave me wings and made me believe in myself.
You showed me right from wrong and was always there beside me giving confidence, pushing me to my limits to make me what I am today. I am deeply touched by your efforts.
If I played a passage incorrectly, you never hesitated me to tell to play it over and over again, once more, until I met your expectations. Not only did you teach me the art of music, but you also empathized with children, respected them and believed that each one of them had something special that could be built on. From grade three to 11, when I walked through your door, you were my pillar of success. When my exams were drawing near, all those extra classes and tiring days of teaching will always be engraved in my heart.
Sita, you were the best example of how to stay positive in all situations, and taught me that there is always room for improvement. You taught a skill that can stimulate the entire mind.
With your faith in God, you continued teaching to the very end, until you suddenly left us. If I do not thank you, I will bear guilt for not telling others about a person who changed me.
As you left us on April 13th, last year, I felta loss at your parting. I will always take with me the lessons you imparted on me, especially the way you taught. Not just to listen to, but to experience music myself.
May your soul rest in peace in the arms of Jesus.

Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe seek to rebuild in tri-nation clash
DHAKA, Sunday: Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe all have a point to prove when they battle each other in a tri-nation one-day tournament in Dhaka from Monday.
The home nation, without a coach, are licking their wounds from a disastrous tour of South Africa. Sri Lanka have just had their worst year in international cricket. And Zimbabwe are on edge after a thrashing by the Proteas that blunted their run-up to a crucial World Cup qualifying tournament in March.
The event, staged at Dhaka's Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, is Bangladesh's first home engagement in more than a year, and follows three heavy ODI defeats in South Africa in October.
Bangladesh have become a strong one-day team in recent times, notably reaching the Champions Trophy semi-finals last year. But they were brutally exposed by the Proteas, as defeats by 10 wickets, 104 runs and 200 runs highlighted how much further they have to go.
"This tri-nation tournament is really important for us. Everyone is upset after the South Africa tour. Now, if we can win this tournament, everything can be changed," said skipper Mashrafe Mortaza.
The task has been made more difficult by the resignation of coach Chandika Hathurusingha, who chose to return to his native Sri Lanka. Hathurusingha makes his debut as Sri Lanka's coach in this tournament.
The 49-year-old former batsman resigned in the middle of the South Africa tour, though the decision was only made public in December.
Former national captain Khaled Mahmud is in interim charge as team director, and the Bangladesh Cricket Board has yet to indicate when a permanent replacement will be named.
Hathurusingha travels to Bangladesh with his own problems, as his new team come out of a demoralising year.
Former World Cup winners Sri Lanka won only five of 29 one-day internationals in 2017.
The country's cricket authorities changed captain twice in six months after influential all-rounder Angelo Mathews stepped down in July, highlighting the turmoil in the national game.
Mathews has been re-appointed as Sri Lanka's limited over captain ahead of 2019 World Cup, for which they were the final team to qualify.
Meanwhile underdogs Zimbabwe, who face Bangladesh in the first game of the tri-nation competition Monday, are looking for a lift ahead of hosting a World Cup 2019 qualifying tournament in March.
Last month they lost a Test in South Africa by an innings and 120 runs inside two days of what was intended to be a historic four-day day-night Test. The match lasted just 907 balls.
Zimbabwe will be boosted by the return of Brendan Taylor and Kyle Jarvis, who have not played one-day internationals since 2015 and 2013 respectively.
Coach Heath Streak has indicated that Zimbabwe will devote more energy to one-day games, due to limited Test opportunities.
The three teams will play each other twice in the two-week tournament, which ends with a final on January 27.

Central Bank reforms: PM seeks IMF support
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has sought the support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to make the much needed legal and structural changes in the Central Bank to combat fraud and corruption, National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva said.
According to the Deputy Minister, a meeting was held on Saturday in this regard where Prime Minister Wickremesinghe requested for assistance from IMF Country Representative Dr. Eteri Kvintradze given the close working relationship between the IMF and the Sri Lanka Central Bank.
Giving a summary of the Bond Commission report, President Maithripala Sirisena too noted that the Commission had recommended for reforms in the Central Bank, the Deputy Minister said adding that accordingly, the government is looking to reform the Monetary Law Act and the Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance.
These laws should be drastically amended or new laws to replace them should be introduced, De Silva added.
According to him, specific areas of the Monetary Law Act, namely the mandate, governance, autonomy and accountability of the Central Bank needs to be reformed.
The IMF has already prepared certain drafts in this regard following past discussions with the government, he said, assuring that the government will accordingly work towards making changes in the structure, management and legal aspects of the Central Bank expeditiously, he said.
At a time where the Central Bank has announced its decision to move towards a flexible inflation targeting regime, the Deputy Minister pointed out that these reforms in laws are paramount to achieve this target.
He also claimed that continuous misuse of the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) occurred due to these reforms not being introduced to the system.
The Deputy Minister also alleged that the Central Banks Code of Conduct was ignored in the past with former Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal only presenting himself at the Public Accounts Committee 13 years after a governor had last appeared before the committee.
While the Bond Commision report is set to be presented to Parliament on January 17, the report will, thereafter, be made available online for the public according to the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Commending the move, Deputy Minister Harsha De Silva said the Prime Minister has instructed the Attorney General to take the necessary legal action based on the COPE report, the Bond Commission report and the others submitted to him.
Action must be taken against all those who have been mentioned as wrongdoers in these reports, he stressed adding that the government is pushing for legal action in this regard.
We hope the necessary action will be taken by the Attorney General promptly, he said adding that those who have broken the law must be dealt with.
The Deputy Minister confirmed that the government will work to introduce the much-needed reforms immediately with the assistance of the IMF.

China's run as world's largest exporter may end, expert says
BEIJING: China, the world's largest exporter, might face a trade deficit in the next five to 10 years as the second-biggest economy is ramping up imports, a former top Chinese official has said.
China could no longer rely on exports to expand its economy as it had done over the past 30 years, said Zhang Yansheng, former secretary general of an academic committee at the National Development and Reform Commission.
This is because exports became unsustainable and would put too much strain on ties with the rest of the world, specially as protectionism grew, he said.
"The next stage is an open economy that focuses on a balance of trade," Zhang told Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post. "Expanding imports is a very significant part of China becoming a big global power," he said.
"The next stage is an open economy that focuses on a balance of trade," Zhang told Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.
China's export and import volumes rose 14.2 per cent year on year to 27.79 trillion yuan (USD 4.28 trillion) last year, ending the continuous drop in the previous two years, according to the official data quoted by state-run Xinhua news agency.
China's exports increased 10.8 per cent to reach 15.33 trillion yuan while imports surged 18.7 per cent to 12.46 trillion yuan in 2017, the General Administration of Customs (GAC) said.
The trade surplus continued to narrow last year, shrinking 14.2 per cent to 2.87 trillion yuan, compared to a reduction of 9.1 per cent registered in 2016 that saw 3.35 trillion yuan in trade surplus. South China Morning Post

Comparing previous elections either Parliamentary or Provincial or Local Govt. it is very clearly visible that there is vast progressive step has taken to minimize unwanted violence among the public of the society/communities after the nominations handed over by the respective candidates for the upcoming Local Govt. elections scheduled to be held in February 2018 by the Department of Elections. This situation has come into force due to following restrictions considering the environmental status of the public as well as to avoid accumulating unwanted garbage dumping.
We experience no preferential voting, no cutouts, no banners with pictures, no decorations with colourful polythene (plastic materials), no canvassing house to house and crowd limited, no posters to be paste on public and other places, no many temporary election huts (booths) within the respective area of the candidate, and etc.
But there are things visible here and there in various places beyond the above restrictions, at this stage, our minds go back to the situation had about 60-65 years ago, when there was an election announced to take place either parliamentary/local Govt. People like us presently living at the age of 70s or more can realize the difference very clearly. For an example, during the that period, still can remember how people moved within the election fever, to elect a member to represent for their own ward of the area, or to the parliament considering the value of the voting franchise of the public in a Democratic nation to achieve better living slandered with basic needs.
Still, it is to mention that those days only a few handouts with details with a symbol and the picture of the candidate printed on low-cost paper similar to the quality of newspaper material distribute within the area. So this is on the results of the stern decisions taken by the present Governing body to implement an impartial and free election system under the policies of Good Governess.
As per reports through media, although we find there are incidents takes place at some areas casually but it is believed and hoped that present situation will be able to maintain last long as until the scheduled elections fever over in this country. Hope for the best.

Commission to probe Mihin, SriLankan fraud  President
A new Presidential Commission will be appointed next week to probe allegations of fraud and corruption at Mihin Lanka Airlines and SriLankan Airlines, President Maithripala Sirisena said on Saturday.
He made these remarks addressing an election rally held at the Gamudava Grounds in Dambulla in support of UPFA candidates contesting from the area.
The President said that the true nature of the previous governments so-called development will be revealed to the public in the future.
President Sirisena said whatever the challenges, he will change the corrupt political culture to win the challenge of building the country.
President Sirisena noted that it was he who through the 19th Amendment to the Constitution annulled the 18th Amendment to the Constitution, which allowed the President to remain in power for life.
The President also said that he was the only leader who vested excessive powers of the Executive Presidency with Parliament, an unprecedented act.
The President said that earlier, the Inspector General of Police, the Attorney General as well as all the judges of the Supreme Court and the appointment of the Independent Commissions too was done by the President, and he said that he is the person who gave those responsibilities to the Parliament and Constitutional Council.
He also said that the people of this country will not forget how the courts gave orders in the past according to the orders received from the Temple Tress.
President Sirisena said he changed the system of shooting innocent Ratupaswala people pleading for water by deploying Armed Forces.
The President recalled how the former Army Commander General Sarath Fonseka was jailed by those who today level allegations against the present government accusing it of hunting the war heroes.
If they talk according to their conscience, they would see that they didnt follow the philosophy of Bandaranaike which values the freedom and democracy or the policy of the SLFP those days.
Presient Sirisena also said that the misuse of the public funds, while committing fraud and corruption they tarnished the image of the Party and defamed the policies of the Party.
Today, the people of this country understands the real situation and emphasised that the SLFP will become the party which is the most of the people rally around and it will be evident in the Local Government elections to be held in February 10, the President said.
Expressing his views regarding the steps taken by the government to develop the agricultural activities of the area as well as to uplift the economic standard of the farming community said that in the future initiatives will be taken to develop the Dambulla Economic Centre while streamlining the management of the Centre and also steps will be taken to eliminate the fraud and corruption to deliver the benefits of the Centre properly for everyone.

The current driving licence issuing system is set to be scrapped in the near future, National Council for Road Safety Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda said.
According to Kodagoda, a decision was taken to review the current system as loopholes are still found in the licence issuing process.
People can still obtain a licence without going through the proper procedures, he said, adding that a new system will be introduced to rectify these issues.
According to Kodagoda, a committee appointed are now in discussion to formulate a new issuing process.
One proposal is to provide a thorough training to public transport drivers prior to issuing the licence, he said. He also added that there are plans to issue driving licences for Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) drivers through the SLTB itself.
Kodagoda said the aim is to improve the quality of drivers in Sri Lanka by streamlining the driving licence issuing process.
He said the committee is also in discussion to introduce a time period for which a vehicle can be used on roads.
Transport Ministry, Sri Lanka Transport Board, National Road Safety Council officials and the Police are participating in these discussions, Kodagoda said.

The Sri Lankan export sector has recorded US Dollars 10,309 million worth exports in 2016 which was a significant achievement Speaker Karu Jayasuriya observed at a forum held in Colombo to coincide with the 23 rd AGM of the National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE).
Jayasuriya said although last years statistics were not available, the country would be able to reach a record foreign exchange target of US$ 15 billion due to the tireless efforts of the countries exporters.The Speaker also thanked the Sri Lanka Export Development Board for their fullest co-operation and unstinting support extended to exporters to expand the sector and said Lankan exporters strength will undoubtedly help to swell the economy further.
He also said unlike earlier the arrival of more foreign investors to Sri Lanka will give more encouragement to Lankan exporters to strengthen the local export market in the years to come .
Jayasuriya also recalled the development of the Lankan export sector during the tenure of former President R Premadasa and said the then President took viable measures to develop the export sector even conducting international exhibitions and said such exhibitions immensely helped to bring over 5,000 foreign businessmen to open new export avenues. He further said the receiving GSP Plus and regaining the fish exports to EU markets also highly benefited Lankan exporters to strengthen the sector and bring more foreign exchange to the country.
Guest of Honour N.C. Narayanan said Sri Lankan exporters have taken all endeavors to develop the export sector and thanked the NCE for their assistance and encouragement extended towards exporters to grow the export sector further.
He also highlighted that even the Government too should help exporters to strengthen the export market considering that increasing exports helps the Government to develop the economy.
NCE, President Ramal Jayasinghe said the Lanka export sector should be developed to the maximum to achieve the expected goal and said the Chamber also actively participated and contributed to the development of the National Export Strategy (NES) undertaken by the State in collaboration with the international Trade Centre in Geneva.

Fair share for the fairer sex
Once flaunted for her beauty she was the queen of all married women. Being remembered merely for her looks was not her dream; placing brains before beauty she seized the opportunity to become the voice of the most vulnerable in the society  women and children. Deputy Chief of Staff at the Prime Ministers Office, Rosy Senanayake shoulders the responsibility of troubleshooting and resolving the many grievances people from all over the country come with. As it is always not possible to meet the Prime Minister, Senanayake acts as the buffer and directs the people who come to see him to right places while also tackling gender and childrens issues in the society. Running for Mayor of Colombo Senanayake has comprehensive plans for the city. Here she shared her thoughts on women in Sri Lanka calling not only women but as many men as possible to be advocates for gender equality.
* How do you see women in Sri Lanka today
The Sri Lankan women are smart, strong, capable, enduring and are multi-taskers especially in taking responsibilities of the family institution since 1/3rd of the households in this country are headed by women. They have shown the strength to deliver results at every level and excel beyond the nations expectations.Women are an integral part of the development in the countrys economy since they earn the larger portion of the foreign revenue; may it be through the migrant woman worker, apparel industry or the agriculture sector. However women are deprived, discriminated against and at their fundamental rights are violated and their dignity is compromised since there are also discriminatory laws pertaining to women in this country.
The country is yet to realize, understand, discover the capacity of a woman and engage her in every aspect of the development of the country.
* What are the areas that you think still need change to support or empower women in the country
The country needs to do a lot more to bring in women leadership. Women are in the forefront in any sector in the economy including education and health care but those who are in the decision making positions are handful. You have to change this mind set. Males easily get promotions and handle top positions. A career woman has to face lot of discrimination in the society. It is astonishing to see that men have mastered many fields that are culturally thought to be a womans specialty. Beauty and cookery are two main fields that men have taken over. If you take the hospitality industry from preparing to meals and to arranging beds are done by males. The chores man wouldnt do at home, he does for a career and those services are recognized and accepted. Even internationally, in countries like in India all the best designers are males but sewing and stitching are culturally thought to be what women should be doing at home. As for women they face a lot of discrimination. They are always given light responsibilities in careers. I am really happy Thalatha Athukorala was made the Minister of Justice, a ministry which was predominantly handled by a man. We need to come out of the framed mindset and attitudes for the country to move forward. Drastic decisions have to be made and policies have to be changed to involve women in decision making.
Other countries have empowered women far greater than Sri Lanka. Norway has established crches to get women involved in the workforce while giving a year off to both parents to take care of the young children. When a conducive environment is created allowing the woman to take care of her family she will be able to contribute to the economy paying taxes which will in turn benefit the State.
Even today, women go to the Middle East for a pittance. I dont think as a Government we have negotiated well enough with regard to safety and salary. Empowering women economically in a sustainable and viable manner  thats something the Prime Minister has been reiterating recently.
Security is one of the major issues due to violence against women in this country. Violence against women has become normalized and it is very important that all sectors of society be educated on this issue so that we can bring about an attitude shift.
Nutrition for women is another major issue. We dont realise how many pregnant mothers are malnourished in the far-flung villages. This is why I brought in the Rs. 20,000 package for every pregnant mother and that is still being carried on. There are other social areas as well. We have a huge female-headed household rate. One in every third household is headed by a woman. Single parenting is an issue. We need to have more social welfare. When it comes to loan schemes and housing projects, we need to give them an edge and have concessional programs. We need to see how we can help women start businesses, by perhaps giving them special provision to not requiring collateral, giving them special loans with minimum interest rates and so on. I believe that is an area we need to concentrate on, especially in relation to women in the north and east and in the deep south, who are suffering.
* The Guardian, in its list of top ten sexist moments in politics included your sexist attack in the Parliament along other renowned women politicians such as Australian PM Julia Gillard and Hillary Clinton. Do you see this situation changed as of present
I have faced a lot of sexism in the Parliament, political rallies and in meetings. People have a culturally weird and warped mindset. Rape, sexual harassments etc are at unacceptable levels. We have to train young children to respect a woman. In Sri Lanka we only upgrade the numeracy and literacy but we do not address the social and emotional thinking of a child. The first five years are the most crucial years of a human beings life as 75 per cent of brain development takes place during this time. Thus right attitudes have to be inculcated in them at this age if we need reconciliation and peace to last. President has appointed a task force of which I am a member and I am happy that I was able to bring a subject called `Think Equal which offers a social and emotional value-based education. It will be taught in schools this year onwards and will cut across caste, creed, religion and gender, practically every discriminative platform and will teach empathy and gender equality.
* How inspirational have your life been to women that you came into contact with What was the response you got as an activist for womens rights
Well I hope that I have been able to be a positive role model for women in Sri Lanka. I have always advocated for equality for women and strived hard to make sure that women in this country get a fair deal. As a womens rights activist I have faced a lot of opposition and hostility but have for the most part been able to win over these people and make them see that women have great capacity and that it makes no sense to discriminate against them. As an activist I have also been fortunate to receive the support of thousands of strong, dedicated, hard working women and many men who support women.
I am aware that becoming the first female mayor will make me more of a role model. As a woman, I will have to do more than just live up to expectations; I will have to exceed them. And I plan to do just that! I also realize that I will be seen as a pioneer for women holding very high leadership positions in government and people will be watching me to see how women perform in positions of leadership. My performance in this role will have repercussions for future female leaders. I am confident that I will be able to lead Colombo to become a safe, smart, economically viable, and corruption free City which caters to and empowers all sections of its citizenry, leaving no doubt about the leadership potential and efficacy of women! I hope that my election as mayor and performance in this role will act as an example to our youth- both female and male- that female leadership is not something to be feared or disdained but something to be encouraged and fostered.
* Currently, how are female candidates handling the campaigns to take up positions in the local government and then later on in the Parliament
Our female candidates are handling the campaigning very well. The new electoral system is more conducive to these candidates as it minimizes the impact of money and thuggery which have been big obstacles to female candidates in the past. The women we have nominated are very experienced and we have also focused on nominating several professionals. They are doing a great job and have been especially focused on door to door campaigning which is essential in the ward system of election. I am very confident that our candidates will win their seats.
More women have to be elected to Parliament. Sri Lanka has one of the worst records in the world with regard to women legislators. I strongly believe that it is the PR system that is depriving women of their rightful access. The system is warped and I am a good example. I lost the elections last time. An enormous amount of money is involved in campaigning under the PR system. Gun and character assassination are rife. A lot of women who want to enter politics are being discouraged just there. Political parties find it very attractive to bring in people with a tailor-made, readymade voter base, people who can fight in the gun culture and put in more money into elections. They get nominations and preference over women. This wont change unless and until you change the political system to a First Past the Post and Proportional Representation mixed system and also have a quota of seats.For me, affirmative action is the also essential. Creating a reservation of seats or a quota in Parliament even just for two terms will enable women to get in there and prove themselves.
* As you are running for Mayor of Colombo what are your plans for the city if elected
My plans are for a safe, smart, economically viable and corruption free city in which people will benefit and be empowered. The CMC is the most important council. Colombo is the hub of Sri Lanka and the CMC is one of the largest and oldest municipalities in the Asian Region.
I am focusing on seven pillars to bring about a new and vital Colombo. In terms of the effectiveness and accessibility of the CMC I plan to focus on The Effectiveness and Efficiency of CMCand Participatory Citizenship. I plan to leverage ICT to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the CMC with online applications and payments, E-procurement etc. Monitoring will be given priority through a high-level Monitoring and Progress Review Unit reporting directly to the Mayor to tackle issues, public complaints, and requests (with response deadlines) to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of all activities and functions of CMC. I plan to actively involve the citizenry in planning, implementation, and monitoring the policies and activities of the CMC. This will involve drafting a Citizens Charter in consultation with all stakeholders, participatory budgets and planning, information dissemination on activities and progress review of CMC by the community. I also plan to hold town hall style meetings where the CMC will meet in public for public hearings once every quarter.
In terms of giving ownership to the people, another major pillar of my manifesto is to establish Multifunctional Community Centers which will empower the community to tackle a variety of issues by funding, reinvigorating, and strengthening existing community centers and establishing new ones. The idea is that these Centers will be a vehicle for the community to come together to tackle issues that are most pressing for their locality; whether it be dengue control, garbage collection, or safety etc. Each center will also cater to the community by providing services like day care, drop in centers for street children, vocational, IT, and English training, counseling services, elder citizens activities, recreation etc.
A Healthy City and A Healthy Citizenry is another pillar of my plans. A priority will be tackling dengue. We willcontrol dengue by identifying hotspots of dengue using past data and the new app Epi Hack and prioritizing areas with highest dengue incidence. We will also get the whole community involved thorough the Multifunctional Community Centers described above. We will begin a zero dengue deaths drive focusing on early detection, early diagnosis, and early treatment.
We need a clean city and the CMC is doing a good job but there is a lot more to be done. We need to establish permanent and sustainable solutions that can address the garbage issue such as permanent dumping sites and implementing projects such as turning waste to energy, recycling, and addressing clinical and hazardous waste issues etc. We must further educate the people on garbage segregation and make them responsible partners with the CMC to keep the city clean.
We will also focus on quality control of food of city eateries through a Central Control Unit using both carrot and stick measures, managing Pollution (noise pollution, visual pollution and air quality) using zoning laws, urban agriculture (home composting and urban garden concept), and recreational areas such as walking paths, green parks etc.
Infrastructure is another priority. I will make maximum use of the CMCs powers to ease the burden of traffic for those living and working in Colombo. We will use shuttles, tackle parking issues, ear-mark land for separate parking areas for private vehicles, school busses and vans and three-wheelers, etc.
Among priority areas will be sanitation, clean drinking water, and toilet facilities, especially for the underserved settlements. These are areas we can immediately work on since the CMC has quite a lot of underserved settlements which also need proper housing facilities. The CMC has the land and the capacity to do it. We will be looking at new council homes for these people who are living in harsh conditions. I think my experience and connections at the national level put me in a unique position to advocate on these issues and get things done.
The sewage systems we have are archaic and it is time for us to look at some major revamping. Fifty years ago, the population of the CMC city limits was much less than it is today; with the demands of the increase of population and infrastructure development, the system is now congested and not functioning effectively, hence we are looking at World Bank and Asian Development Bank funded projects with regard to the sewage system and waste water.
As for roads, there is an approximately 300 km road network which must be maintained and reconstructed. There are some projects in progress with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank but there is more work to be done. Flooding is an issue to be addressed and waste water disposal projects will be looked at seriously.
The municipality has many playgrounds and parks; these need to be improved to include activities for kids. We need to maintain the grounds, add gyms, sports clubs, and recreation facilities, which would help in keeping the youth off the streets and improve their living standards.
Cultural Development is another pillar of a new and revitalized Colombo. To cater to the future demands, we have space and areas that we have already identified to turn into restaurant strips, tourist strips and for the residents to have leisure activities such as hawker streets. We have so far identified eight places for PPPs in this regard, including Marine Drive, where we can have light entertainment for people and families. Lighting up the city and giving the city a new face would also be top priority.
Importantly we will also actively promote Colombo as a multicultural center using PPP, for example to foster local arts, develop cultural museums, create cultural zones etc. Colombo is a unique place with its own history, traditions, and arts scenes. We hope that this will bring about e must be more cultural and ethnic integration within the City.
Finally, Women and Children. I will be focusing on Maternal and Child healthcare and a nutrition package, establishing new day care centers (PPPs) and monitoring existing ones etc. It is also important to have income generating programs and training programs, especially for women, with an emphasis on empowering them in practically every possible aspect, including reproductive health. A lot of women in Colombo City find it hard to make ends meet; we want to give them solid income generating programs.
With regard to children, early childhood education and preschools will be top priority. I will also look at PPPs for vocational training for school dropouts, and an opportunity to learn English for every child in these areas. Our focus is to keep children off the streets, which is in line with the Prime Ministers vision, where education is compulsory from Grade 1-13, and we will support this system. I will also focus on drop-in centers for street children and the homeless, family strengthening programs to prevent institutionalization of children, and school entry program for facilitate school admission of children of urbanites.
* What is your advice for working women in the country How can they be successful as a mother, housewife and as a career woman
Being a working woman is by no means easy. It means balancing work, home, and family. Even today, women shoulder a disproportionate share of responsibility for looking after their homes, their children, elderly parents and relatives etc. Hopefully this will change with people becoming more aware of the responsibilities of men as husbands, fathers, and sons but we still have a long way to go. The workplace also has to change to become more supportive of working parents by providing more maternity and paternity leave, opportunities for flexi time etc.
I have worked all my adult life and have been lucky enough to manage to balance that with family very successfully. I think having a supportive spouse is extremely important. If your spouse doesnt support your career and is not willing to share the responsibilities of family, it is going to be much more difficult.
I advise all young women to ensure that they consider this when choosing a future life partner! It is also important to make sure you have a village of people to support you- friends, family, colleagues etc- who will pick up the slack at those times when you are overwhelmed.
Sri Lankan women are hard working, educated, and intelligent and are more than capable of balancing work and family and I encourage all women to see themselves as the strong and capable people that they are.

Get rid of the paining head
Consultant ENT Surgeon Dr. Ms. Chandra Jayasuriya (MBBS (Colombo), D.L.O.M.S (Otolaryngology), FRCS (Edin) the Head of the ENT Unit of the Colombo National Hospital speaks about some very common issues related to headaches, possible solutions / treatment for such issues and other related facts.
Q - What cause headaches
A - There are two causes. The first cause is the pathologies occurring inside the skull (Intra cranial) and the second reason is the pathologies occurring outside the skull (Extra cranial). The Intra cranial causes concerns contents within the skull such as brain, blood vessels, membranes covering the brain (meninges) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which cushions the brain in the skull. If the volume of any of the contents is increased, pressure inside the skull rises. This causes severe, intractable headache resistant to pain killers.
The patient may have disturbed sleep patterns and may awake due to pain. The patient may wake up with severe pain. Vomiting and fits may also occur. These symptoms will cause a doctor to suspect an intra cranial pathology. A thorough examination of the nervous system (including examination of the eye with an opthalmoscope) is required. Brain scans (CT and MRI) are necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Intra cranial infections leading to abscess formation infections can spread directly through skull fractures or indirectly from ears and nasal sinuses through meninges is another reason for headache.
Intra cranial bleeding due to head injury or spontaneous rupture of congenitally malformed blood vessels is another reason for headache. Brain tumour leading to increase skull pressure (abnormal growth of nerve cells, meninges or blood vessels or hydrocephalus), increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) content within the skull also can cause headache. CSF is between the brain and the meninges (covering brain). Four brain cavities situated within the brain are also filled with CSF. CSF inside and outside the brain gets continuously circulated. The intra cranial pressure increases when circulation is blocked by tumours or trauma.
Extra cranial is caused by diseases of the teeth. Teeth infections or eruption of the last molar may lead to severe headache. People should have a routine dental check up on a six to 12 month basis.
Q - What are the other causes of headaches
A - A person may not become aware of a gradual decrease of eyesight. Eye fatigue may erupt as a headache. In view of this, every patient with a headache should have his / her eyes examined. At around 40 years of age, the coordination of eye muscles become poor, resulting in poor sight (Presbiopia). There is also the risk of a beginning of cataracts and glaucoma (increased pressure inside the eyeball). It is therefore wise to consult an eye surgeon when one is around 40 years of age.
Sinusitis can also cause headache. The causes for the sinuses getting blocked are allergy, catarrh, viral infection (cold), nasal blockage, administering nasal decongestants for a long time without medical supervision.
Diseases of the joints can cause headache. Other reasons include problems of tempero-mandibular joint (jaw joint), cervical vertebrae (cervical spondylosis) and malocclusion of teeth leading to fatigue of joints and muscles, causing ear ache and headache. The pain may become worse during chewing. Mal dentition should be corrected. Physiotherapy may also help to ease the muscle fatigue.
Cervical spondylosis is a disease of inter vertebral joints and discs of the neck bones, leading to pain and limitation of movement including headache and neck pain and pain running along the arm. Ultimately the spinal code may also get damaged. This can be diagnosed by an x-ray of the neck. Pain killers and physiotherapy will be helpful to overcome this issue.
Q - How can we identify the cause of a headache
A - Stress headache (Tension headache) can be due to vascular diseases. For an example Migraine, cluster headache ect. The muscles in the scalp and neck experience prolonged spasms due to stress, causing pain in the head and neck. It feels like a band around the head. The pain lasts from minutes to hours. Women are more prone to tension headaches. Approximately 20 per cent of the world population suffer from these headaches. Some are affected by it every day. The pain appears more towards the evening. When it is not severe, it is not an impediment to daily activities. The headaches are accompanied by other symptoms of stress such as poor sleep, anger, tiredness, gastric acid. When you are affected more than 15 days of the month, it is called a chronic tension headache.
The causes for tension headache are as follows.
(1) Wrong seating position at work leading to spasm of neck and head ; holding telephone between ear and neck to answer causing severe neck spasm ; reduced vision also leads to incorrect seating position (hunching over to view computer screen).
(2) Lack of sleep due to work overload.
(3) Depression and anxiety due to problems at work or home leading to increase stress.
(4) Improper chewing leading to tempero-mandibular joint problems (Muscles around the joints to go into spasms and cause difficulty in opening the mouth and when molar and pre-molar teeth are missing, chewing becomes improper resulting in fatigue to the joint)
(5) Hunger also causes stress.
(6) Strong computer and cellular phone lights cause the muscles in the head to contract.
Q - What are the treatments available for those issues
A - A hot water bath and heat fomentation of the tensed muscles will relieve pain. Massage of tensed muscles after applying warm oil also relieves spasm of muscles. Correct vision, proper posture, reducing the strength of the computer and cellular phone lights, minimizing usage are some other things you can do to avoid headaches. The eyes need a rest from time to time. Therefore focus your eyes to a long distant object (for an example looking out through the window) when you work long hours using a computer. Do relaxation exercises to release stress during your break. Have six hours of sleep per night. Keep a small, flat pillow under your neck. Minimize the use of pain killers as long term use can cause rebound headaches.

Government terminated murder culture of former regime
"The murder culture which prevailed during the former President's tenure was terminated by the Good Governance. Therefore, we should think, whether we are going to re-enter a dark era again," the All Ceylon Makkal Congress Deputy Leader and Parliamentarian M.H.M. Navavi said.
He was addressing the meeting in support of the UNP LG candidates in the Puttalam Local Council election held under the chair of Parliamentarian and UNP Organiser for the Puttalam electorate Hector Appuhami at the Puttalam Vettukulam Junction.
"Local Councils' last four years. This government will rule for the next three years. Therefore, if the administration of Local Councils is given to the UNP, the country will see a rapid development," he said.
"From 1970, the UNP has been administering the Urban Council - then the ruling party," he said.
"Minister Rishard Badiudeen, who struggles for the betterment of Sri Lankan Muslims, is being blamed by others. The Minister has provided an ACMC parliamentary seat through the national list to a Puttalam person," he said.
"We will develop the area along with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesingha,Minister Rishard Badiudeen and Hector Appuhami. A large sum was spent to develop the Puttalam town. The Minister raises his voice in Parliament to develop the area," he said.

Hathurusingha savours new challenge with Sri Lanka
DHAKA, Sunday: Chandika Hathurusingha on Sunday welcomed the challenge of coaching a deflated Sri Lanka back to form after their worst year in international cricket, marked by humiliating defeats and few wins.
The freshly-appointed head coach took the bruised national side to Bangladesh over the weekend ahead of their first international series of the year.
Hathurusingha said Sri Lanka "have a lot to improve" but he was optimistic they could turn the corner after a dismal year of losses, leadership changes, injuries and scandal for the former World Cup winners.
"I am excited to take up the challenge. I am excited with the talent and skills available with my team now," Hathurusingha, 49, told reporters Sunday. A tri-nation one-day international tournament starts Monday with a contest between Zimbabwe and Bangladesh.
Sri Lanka's first match of the event is against Zimbabwe Wednesday, before they face Bangladesh two days later.
It is familiar ground for Hathurusingha, who quit as Bangladesh head coach in the middle of their disastrous tour of South Africa to return to his native Sri Lanka.
The islanders are licking their wounds after their worst performance since 1987.
Sri Lanka won just five of their 29 ODIs, with injury and scandals also plaguing the side on and off the field.
Angelo Mathews stood down as captain in July amid the turmoil but just six months later was reappointed skipper for limited-overs cricket ahead of the 2019 World Cup.
Sri Lanka were the final team to qualify for the tournament they won in 1996. Hathurusingha resigned as Bangladesh coach in October after a largely successful stint helping the side claim several high-profile wins and reach seventh in the ODI rankings.
He ruled out being "emotionally attached" to his former side, but wished Bangladesh well in the tri-nation series.
"I worked with them closely and got to know them really well. At the same time, I want Sri Lanka to do well," he said.
Mathews, 30, said he was pleased to return as skipper. "I never expected it, but I am looking forward to it," he said. - AFP

How reading is helping me accomplish New Years resolutions
Its been a couple of weeks, and now is when so many of us start getting real with ourselves. The New Year is less shiny, and were starting to see that we still have to tie our shoes and make our beds in 2018, just like every other year.
I personally am completely committed to my New Years resolutions, though I typically start off with the word goals. Goals acknowledges that it will take some work to reach them, while resolutions makes it seem like there is no way I wont succeed. This is not my first rodeo. I know there will be things I cannot accomplish.
That being said, Ive found that some days, even only a few days into the year, I wake up a little overwhelmed. Or a lot overwhelmed. I feel like I want to achieve a whole years worth of results, but I can only do that one hour at a time. It makes me, counterintuitively, drop all my productivity and turn aside to wasting time.
So Im trying to focus on doing something else instead: I try to read for at least 15 minutes as the start of my time working on goals. There are a ton of ways that reading can help with reaching New Years resolutions, but here are the ways they are helping me right now.
Do One Thing At a Time
When Im tempted to start five projects and then immediately abandon them all, I have to scale it back. I say I will do just one thing, which is reading a book. Sometimes it is an important book I need to read to accomplish a goal, but just as often I grab whatever book I havent read yet and give it a few chapters.
Doing one thing at a time is tough for the Millennial generation. Since weve been rewarded for learning how to multitask ourselves crazy on electronic devices, it is nice that just reading clears my brain. Whats more, at some point, my mind will wander a little, even while Im still reading. Ill be ready to set aside my book to switch to just one new task. Typically I begin my freelance working mornings this way, since trying to do everything at once doesnt work at all for me.
See Clear Results and Feel Accomplished
Closing a book and putting it to the side after reading the final page is so clearly an ending. When you know that youve finished a novel or nonfiction book, you can cross it off your 2018 Read Harder list. You can also write it in a notebook with all the other titles youve finished.
The feeling of accomplishment creates a drive to do so again. I know that finishing a book is enviably clear as far as completing goals go. With many of they typical New Years resolutions, it takes a long time to know of the goal has been met, and even then the results may seem mixed. Getting a cut-and-dry accomplishment in your system gives you sustenance on those days when it seems like no goal will ever be fully achieved.
Accomplish Tedious Tasks With Greater Entertainment
The same thing that makes uni-tasking a physical book lovely works in the opposite direction with audiobooks. An audiobook can help you resolve to clean your house more often, to work out at the gym, to finally address all those thank-you notes from the holidays. The adult world is riddled with repetitive tasks like commuting that require some attention but not all of it, and Im infinitely more motivated on those kinds of non-thinking tasks when I have my headphones on and a great book rolling.

I requested the SC to clarify my term of office: President
Adressing an election meeting at Tissamaharama, President Maithripala Sirisena said he requested the Supreme Court (SC) to give clarification on his term of office. He said that he would accept the decision of the Supreme Court, whatever it is, and added that it was the proper procedure followed by previous presidents as well.
Certain people who want to derive a political mileage out of this request of mine, is using it to sling mud at me in order to tarnish my image, President Sirisena said.
The president further said certain people even took the fertiliser shortage to sling mud at him and his regime, although they knew that such shortcomings occurred even during previous regimes. He added that when the acute shortage of fertiliser occurred, he rang up the Pakistani Prime Minister to provide him with a consignment of fertiliser. The Pakistani Prime Minister then dispatched a quantity of 75,000 metric tonnes of fertiliser to Sri Lanka the following day. Currently, there is no fertiliser shortage and the farming community is satisfied that they got the consignment of fertiliser when they needed it the most.
President Sirisena said three years of his tenure at office was spent on wining the the international community that was not on good terms with the previous regime. The international community placed their faith in him and 193 countries that come under the purview of the United Nations (UN) are now good friends of Sri Lanka. The leaders of those countries now have soft corners in their hearts for our country and pledged to extend their support at any time when we are in need of their assistance.
The President added that decent people should be elected to Local Government institutions in order to develop the respective villages and towns they represent. Wrongdoers among the elected would be severely dealt with according to the existing rules and regulations. The country had enough corrupt chairmen in Local Governments during the previous Rajapaksa regime, and it was they who defeated Mahinda Rajapaksa. It was the duty of the people of the respective Local Government areas, to elect honest, hard-working representatives sans corruption and malpractices. Addressing the rally further, President Maithripala Sirisena said he was duty-bound as the President of the country and the people, to rid the country of corruption and malpractices. He said he was not power-hungry and he was prepared to give up the presidency even today, without any hesitation. Corrupt politicians are not an asset or a legacy to a country, but a liability, the President added.

Indiscipline, root of all evil
Time is running out! Its the right moment to think about, and reflect upon, us. We must not forget the fact that our future lies on how fast and how we are going to plan the future. Unfortunately, we are a nation without a vision for the future. Everyone passes the ball to another blaming each one. Is it possible to step into future without any commitment as true patriots
It is opportune that we must repetitively remember  or be repetitively reminded, rather  the famous maxim of John F Kennedy: Ask not what the country has given to you: Instead ask yourselves what you have given to the country!
The quality of the public life has gone down beyond control. The government is working on a proper plan to improve the quality of the public transport system in order to ease down the traffic-congested roads. It is revealed that about 52 percent of the western province population belongs to the category of public commuters either on bus or train. It is some good news that the authorities have at least decided to address the grass-roots level concerns such as solving the traffic congestion on the road.
Road discipline
In the meantime, the government shall not forget law enforcement. That should be another priority. Although the commuters are entitled to a valid bus ticket, they are sadly deprived of that right in the broad daylight. The law enforcement should not be confined to such broad daylight robberies, but also expanded to motorists on the roads. It is another priority.
The average Sri Lankan motorist is clueless about road discipline. They are in a big rush, for one. All the motorists are trying to bypass each other by overtaking on each other. The vehicle queues seem ridiculous. The road signs go unnoticed and neglected. All this finally takes a heavy toll on the innocent pedestrians, the majority of whom succumb to death on pedestrian crossings. Needless to explain, though worse still is what the bus drivers are up to. They are entangled in a race rather than commuting the public. Some youths, on the other hand, are testing the acceleration mode of the most modern vehicles only to meet the Waterloo in the end.
The list would go on, but when we will see an end to all this remains the ultimate question. Let me shift from motorists to the pavement hawkers. They are becoming an increasing menace. They seem to have taken it for granted that they reserve every right to acquire every perch of the pavement. Later on, they become victims of some opportunistic politicians and the underworld.
Religious and cultural heritage
Recently we witnessed an event where some pavement hawkers have acquired the backyard of Kuttam Pokuna in the sacred city of Anuradhapura. Did anybody have the slightest idea what this place is at all They will never ever know the historical and archaeological value of this monument! Or is it simply a scenic value attached to the historic monument
Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Sigiriya are not meant only for tourism. The authorities must maintain law and discipline to preserve all these historical sites. They must have a plan to give a better understanding of how important these places are to the Sri Lankans. They must have every detail of these national treasures recorded. It only shows the strength of greatness that the Sri Lankans can claim. Everybody should be made aware of that understanding. And let them realize that these are not merely places of religious observations!
The poor people who want to earn a living in and around these places must be educated not to ridicule the scenic value of this ancient civilisation. For that purpose, there should be law and order for the sake of discipline. Our ancestors were quite civilised to create these national treasures for posterity.
Our first priority should be law and order. Its the need of the hour!

Kane at the double as Spurs rout Everton; Chelsea only draw
LONDON, Saturday: Harry Kane continued his rich scoring streak by netting twice in Tottenham Hotspurs 4-0 win over Everton at Wembley as Mauricio Pochettinos side made up ground on third-placed Chelsea who shared a goalless draw with 10-man Leicester City.
For a while, it looked as if Kane might be outshone by his team mate Son Heung-min, who scored in a home game for the fifth successive time.
Then Kane took over to net in the 47th and 59th minutes to take his seasons league tally to 20, the fourth consecutive campaign he has reached the landmark.
Christian Eriksen rounded off a cleverly worked team move, again featuring Son, for Spurs fourth as Everton crashed to their heaviest defeat under Sam Allardyce, who gave a debut to 27 million pound ($37 million) new signing Cenk Tosun.
With three of the top four not playing, fifth-placed Tottenham moved level with Liverpool on 44 points, three behind Chelsea. Antonio Contes side missed the chance to go second as Leicester hung on for a draw at Stamford Bridge despite the 68th-minute dismissal of Ben Chilwell. It was the third successive game in all competitions that Chelsea failed to score, with striker Alvaro Morata looking frustrated and short of confidence.
Manager Conte believes they are paying the price for playing seven games in three weeks, with no let-up in prospect as they contest four competitions. I think I saw a lot of very tired players, Conte said.
Elsewhere, there were more controversial refereeing decisions as English football continued to debate whether the video assistant referee (VAR) system, which was tested in some cup games last week, would benefit the Premier League.
The first flashpoint occurred at Vicarage Road where TV replays revealed Watfords Abdoulaye Doucoure bundled the ball over the line with his right hand in the 2-2 draw with Southampton.
A seventh Premier League defeat in eight games had looked likely for Marco Silvas side after James Ward-Prowse scored twice but Andre Gray set up a thrilling finale before Doucoures contribution led to furious Southampton protests.
We can do nothing now, said Southampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino diplomatically. However, Watford striker Troy Deeney admitted that had the VAR system been in operation we probably wouldnt have got it.
At Newcastle United, bottom side Swansea City believed they were unlucky not to be awarded a penalty when Mohamed Diame appeared to handle the ball.
Swansea manager Carlos Carvalhal said: My assistant says that its a very clear penalty and a red card also, but what can we do Nothing, only talk about this. This is one of the situations VAR will in the future say clear penalty  it will be clear.
There was nothing controversial about West Ham Uniteds 4-1 destruction of Huddersfield Town, a victory that puts the Hammers 11th in the table.
When David Moyes took over as West Ham manager many observers questioned his ability to get the team scoring again. But the Scot has proved all the doubters wrong with the London side scoring 12 goals from his past five league games in charge.
A Manuel Lanzini double plus strikes from Mark Noble and the impressive Marko Arnautovic gave the visitors a comfortable victory that took them above Huddersfield, for whom Joe Lolley scored and new 14 million pound ($19.2 million) signing Alex Pritchard came on as a substitute.
The win was Moyes 200th in the Premier League, a landmark reached by only three other managers.
At Selhurst Park, Crystal Palaces revival under Roy Hodgson continued with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Burnley which moved them five points above the relegation zone.
Alan Pardew was another manager breathing easier after West Bromwich Albion beat Brighton & Hove Albion 2-0 to record their first win in 21 league games and his first in nine as their manager.
Both Albion goals came via headers from Chris Brunt corners, with Jonny Evans and Craig Dawson rising above Brightons defence. - Agencies

Kohli stands firm for India against South Africa
Centurion: Indian captain Virat Kohli stood firm against a relentless South African bowling attack on an attritional second day of the second Test at SuperSport Park on Sunday.
Kohli made 85 not out as India reached 183 for five at the close in reply to South Africa's first-innings total of 335.
It was tough going for both batsmen and bowlers on a slow pitch on a hot day. Kohli made his runs off 130 balls with eight fours.
South Africa's four fast bowlers operated in short spells while left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj bowled a lengthy spell and broke the biggest partnership of the innings when he had Murali Vijay caught behind for 46.
Vijay and Kohli put on 79 for the third wicket after two wickets fell in two balls with the total on 28, with Lokesh Rahul falling to a sharp return catch to Morne Morkel and Cheteshwar Pujara being run out attempting a single off the first ball he faced.
Pujara played Morkel to mid-on and set off for a run. New cap Lungi Ngidi made good ground, slid to pick up the ball and hit the stumps at the bowler's end from a prone position.
The powerfully built Ngidi was one of four bowlers to take a wicket each. He built up impressive pace, with one delivery timed at 150.5 km/h.Having come close to dismissing Kohli leg before wicket -- the Indian captain was saved by a faint inside edge on a ball which was crashing into his stumps -- he had Parthiv Patel caught behind.
Earlier, South African captain Faf du Plessis made 63 before the hosts were bowled out for 335.
Du Plessis battled for 217 minutes and faced 142 balls before he was ninth man out, bowled when he went for a big hit against Ishant Sharma.
South Africa added 66 runs to their overnight 269 for six.
Sharma took two of the four wickets that fell, finishing with three for 46, while off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin took four for 113.
India dropped three catches, all off Ashwin. Kagiso Rabada, who made 11, was dropped by a diving Kohli at slip when he had one, with the batsman taking two runs. AFP

LAC celebrates Elimination of Violence against Women
November 25 is the internationally-recognized day celebrating the elimination of violence against women.
The Legal Aid Commission organized a White Ribbon Campaign, with a series of programmes to commemorate the occasion, from November 25 to December 10. The programme was launched island-wide through 82 Legal Aid centers. The following activities took place to highlight the importance of the event.
A team of lawyers visited the foreign embassies in the island from November 25 to December 10 and pinned white ribbons on diplomats and other staff.
Legal awareness programmes were carried out in schools and womens organizations through Legal Aid centers, island wide, and an awareness-raising programme for Special Task Force Officers attached to the STF Headquarters was conducted as well. Further, banners were displayed and leaflets were distributed in order to educate the public.
International Trends
In 1961, three sisters in the Dominican Republic who protested against the dictatorship were killed on the orders of the then President Rafail Trujillo.
This paved the way for the initiation of a women's movement to protest against violence against women, which was officially recognized by the UN in 1999, subsequently declaring November 25 as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.
Where are we
Women in Sri Lanka play a significant role in the country's economy, education, and social sectors. They contribute as housewives, migrant workers, estate workers, factory workers, and government and private sector employees.
Justice for women
There are many laws in Sri Lanka to protect women and safeguard their rights.
Article 12(1) and 12(2) of our Constitution express equality before the law. Special provisions for the advancement of women can be made under Article 12(4).
There are other legislations such as the Domestic Violence Act No. 34 of 2005, Penal Code Provisions (eg  sec 345), Maintenance Act No. 37 of 1999, Factories Ordinance 1950, Maternity Benefits Ordinance  1941, Shop and Office Employees Act -1954 and Employment of Women young Persons and Children's Act 1956, etc.
Legal aid for women
The Legal Aid Commission (LAC) has a special unit for the well-being of women. The LAC does not consider the income levels of women, and provides Rs. 25,000 for maintenance cases filed on behalf of women and children.
The LAC also organizes legal awareness programmes and legal aid clinics for women on their legal rights. The International Day for Women falls on March 8 and the International Day on the Elimination of Violence against Women falls on November 25, every year.

ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup
Lakshan century sees Sri Lanka home
WHANGAREI: On winning the toss in their Group D opener, Ireland captain Harry Tector declared that he wanted his team to post a tall total and put scoreboard pressure on Sri Lanka. They could have done better on both counts. Dhananjaya Lakshans unbeaten 101 and captain Kamindu Mendiss unbeaten 74 ensured the young Lankan lions didnt stumble in their first 2018 ICC U19 CWC encounter at the Cobham Oval in Whangarei.
Their unbroken 157-run stand helped Sri Lanka win by seven wickets in a match that was reduced to a 48-overs a side encounter after rain delayed play by an hour.
Irelands Jamie Grassi had scored a 75 and added 73 for the opening with Mark Donegan (36). It had set them up well for big total, but a middle order slide  with Mendis returning 3 for 35  meant they were restricted to 207/8 in a match that was reduced to a 48 overs a side after rain delayed play by an hour.
The Ireland bowlers did put Sri Lanka under the pump, and for a while it seemed as though they would go on to contain them. Sri Lanka were reduced to 9/2 within four overs, with Aaron Cawley inducing edges off both Hasitha Boyagoda and Nipun Dhananjaya. Boyagoda was caught behind for nought, while Dhananjayas outside edge ended up with Neil Rock at first slip.
Dhananjaya Lakshan receives the Man of the Match award. 
Krishan Sanjula joined Lakshan and attempted to stage a recovery, but the runs came at a crawl. They crossed the 50-run mark only in the 12th over, and with every dot ball, the pressure compounded, not helped by constant Ireland chatter. When Max Neville had Sanjula caught behind for a 17, Sri Lanka were staring at defeat at 51/3.
Captains lead by example and lift their followers in times of troubles. Thats exactly what Mendis did. He didnt let the Ireland bowlers weigh him down. Instead, he attacked as soon as he entered the field. There were boundaries in the two overs immediately after his arrival, and the running between wickets was exceptional. Most mis-fields and overthrows were capitalised on, leading to more fielding lapses.
With his captain scoring freely, the pressure on Lakshan eased as well. The shackles were abandoned, and he played his shots  a lot of his runs came on the leg-side, his expertise with the pull particularly noteworthy. He brought up his half-century, and then accelerated further. It was soon a two-pronged attack, and the Irish shoulders dropped.
Mendis brought up his half-century off just 53 balls, before Lakshan entered the nineties. There was an attack of cramps, but he didnt let that bother him  the century was brought up off just 116 balls, a knock comprising eight fours and a six. It was Mendis, the game-changer, who fittingly scored the winning runs.
Earlier, the Sri Lankan pacemen, Thisaru Rashmika and Nipun Malinga didnt allow the Ireland batsmen to capitalise on any loose deliveries. For their part, the batsmen steered clear of risks, and concentrated on running between wickets. They were excellent in that regard, so much that they put the pressure on Sri Lanka despite infrequent boundaries. After four bowlers tried and failed to break the stand, the Sri Lankan captain took matters into his own hands  Mendis cramped Mark Donegan for room, and clipped the top of his stumps.
The wicket came at a bad time for Ireland, and they encountered a slide. Morgan Topping managed just a 22-ball 8 before running himself out and was soon joined back in the pavilion by Tector (6), again run out after poor communication. Grassi completed his half-century off 86 balls, but with wickets falling around him, he felt the responsibility to up the ante. His attempt at enterprise ended in his fall though as he slashed Daniel straight to cover.
Sam Murphy and Graham Kennedy then managed to grind 22 for the fifth wicket, before departing in quick succession, and for a while, it seemed Ireland wouldnt touch 200. However, Joshua Littles 19-ball 25, which included a mammoth six off Jehan Daniel over long-on, helped boost the total. They could have done with a few more of those.
Man of the Match Lakshan said, I am very, very happy that I got a hundred today. Its my first international 100, and I got a lot of support from the captain (Kamindu Mendis). When he walked in, our first target was to make sure we got close to the opposition total. We set small targets, and we achieved it. Yes, a couple of my partners fell cheaply, but it didnt put pressure on me. My objective was to get my team to the total, and once the captain came, we knew we had enough quality in the team to do that.
Sri Lanka U19 captain Mendis said, When I came to bat, it was 51/3 and we were under pressure. So I just tried to hit and rotate strike with Dhananjaya (Lakshan), do the basic things well and put partnership up with him. So we could easily get the target. I just spoke to Lakshan and told him to play positively and to rotate strike, and he did that really well. He supported me well. Their openers batted well, and we had to bowl more dot-balls. We did that, and towards the end of the innings, they couldnt get more runs on the board. We just tried to pressure them.
Ireland U19s losing captain Harry Tector said, We were probably about 50 runs short, to be honest. We set a good platform, Mark Donegan and Jamie Grassi batted well up top, but we were unable to sort of kick on and get that big score to really put them under considerable pressure. And then we had them 9/2 and 51/3 and we were very much in the game. But sometimes youve to give credit where its due, I thought the two guys who finished the game, they batted really well. There werent many chances apart from the odd run-out which we didnt take, so credit to them. They batted very well.

Lanka seeking to modify performance criteria; EFF broadly  on track : IMF
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says Sri Lankas performance under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program has remained broadly on track despite a series of weather-related supply shocks.
Following the Executive Boards discussion of the third EFF review, Mitsuhiro Furusawa, Acting Chair and Deputy Managing Director of IMF, said countrys fiscal performance has been satisfactory and all targets until September were met.
Nevertheless, Sri Lankas high debt burden, large gross financing needs, and weak financial performance of state-owned enterprises increases the importance of further fiscal consolidation, Furusawa said.
Timely progress in structural reforms, including tax administration and energy pricing, will support fiscal consolidation.
Sri Lankas budget targets a primary surplus of 1 percent of GDP and frontloads fiscal consolidation towards the authorities objective of reducing the overall fiscal deficit to 3.5 percent of GDP by 2020.

Matara-Kakunedora railway leg to open on Feb. 28
History of Sri Lankas railway would be re written on February 28 when the Southern railway line from Matara would be extended to Kakunedora.
Upon completion all Matara bound trains will then be extended up to Kakunedora which is a 6 km extension under this modern railway project. This is the first time in the countrys history that a new rail track is being laid to a new area. The railway line would be then extended up to Beliatta which is around 26.75 kilometers away (single line category) and this will be opened in October this year also creating six new railway stations. The total investment for the project is US$ 258.5 million which is being funded by EXIM Bank of China.
The project is being built by China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation along with the Chinese Railway and also assisted by the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau who also built Sri Lankas longest rail bridge and longest tunnel. In addition by introducing a taller rail track and not having gaps in between them the Chinese engineers say that trains could achieve a speed of 120 KPH which too would be the fastest train speed in the country.
This project will establish an important transportation net among air, ocean and the land, which will help local people get rid of poverty, and have significant influence on the economic recovery. The smooth implementation of this project will further strengthen bi-lateral relations and have positive impact on the two countries in the field of economy and politics, said Vice President China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation Zhao Jun.
This project will develop and establish systematic standards and specifications for new railway constructions in Sri Lanka and vigorously promote local employment. The area near the new railway stations too would get developed as they would get a new mode of transport, he said.
The project which began in August 2013 also includes Sri Lankas longest and second longest railway bridges with 1.5 km and 1.04 km length respectively. The longest railway bridge is now nearing completion at Wattegama. One of the highest elevated railway bridges in Sri Lanka coming up in Weralagoda close to Beliatta too is nearing completion. These are being built to avoid marshy land and also to avoid floods, said Chairman Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau Eng. G. D. A. Piyathilake.
The longest tunnel with 615 meter length in Sri Lanka is just near the exit of the Kekunedora Railway station and the biggest railway station building with cutting-edge design in Sri Lanka will also be built in Beliatta and this too would be ready by October 2018.
This second phase for which the feasibility study is being conducted is from Beliatta to Hambantota and the third stage would be taking it up to Kataragama. The total distance would be 126.5 kilo meters.

MR attempting to split SLFP: Duminda
SLFP General Secretary, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake yesterday accused former President Mahinda Rajapaksa of attempting to divide the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
In a discussion with the Daily News the Minister said Rajapaksa was trying to divide the SLFP for petty political gain.
He urged voters and political representatives of the SLFP not to be fooled by canards spread by some politician close to the former President.
The Political conduct of the former President is jeopardising the SLFP by splitting it to fragments, he said.
"The leader of 'Pohottuwa" party G.L. Peris, supposed to be a renowned expert in law, is not competent even to prepare a nomination paper correctly. Could there be any political future or stability for such a party he asked.
He said the SLPP could not hoodwink the people and the SLFP would give a fitting reply on the election day.
He noted that the Rajapaksa and his supporters were hindering efforts to bring in new constitutional amendments and were spreading falsehoods in an attempt to scuttle the necessary changes from coming into effect. Dissanayake said that after a lapse at 26 years, today the SLFP was contesting under the Hand symbol with the UPFA. He said those who follow Bandaranaike policies should follow the SLFP under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The SLFP General Secretary warned that any member of the party working against the partys interest will be dealt with legally .
No SLFPer has the right to work against the mother party, having got energised politically from the SLFP and it is totally wrong ethically," he said.
The Minister said the SLFP would win 18 Pradeshiya Sabhas and one Municipal Council.
The government has so far spent Rs. 1,500 million on the Anuradhapura District to provide it with drought relief and will continue to do so, the Minister said.

MR boasts about what he has not done: Thalatha
Justice and Foreign Affairs Minister Thalatha Atukorale says former President Mahindea Rajapaksa has said that he had constructed the Rajagiriya Fly Over and planned the Moragahakanda Project.
She was addressing a political rally held in Ratnapura for the support of the UNP candidates in the LG polls.
She said one person told on the TV that she was formulating laws to send several opponents to prison for 20 years. "I am a lawyer myself and I know regulations of the country very well. We know that judiciary is superior to every other institutions," she said.
She said she did not work just like Mahinda did in his tenure hiding files and punishing only those who went against him. "He put under the carpet the files of Nanda Ellawala's murderers and now those details come out. Now we have gone past that era. We respect the people's freedom more than the power that we have now. Some ask us what we have done for the last two years. But they know by heart that they enjoy more freedom and political fairness now," the Minister said.
She said the government did not promote politics of slogans. "We do not hold entertainments spending the public money in millions. We do not hold inauguration festivities just like Mahinda and clan did in their duration spending millions of rupees on unnecessary propaganda campaigns," she said.
She said the UNP government has initiated a high number of development programmes since J.R. Jayewardene's era and beyond. "We do not have to put new hoardings to show our activities to develop the country. What we have done so far is more than enough to put the public on our stead," she said. "Mahinda Rajapaksa is now attempting to put our Prime Minister in blame. If anyone can prove the Prime Minister is guilty for any wrong, I will resign from my ministerial post. We witnessed what MR did during his time destructing the assets of the country. Thieves think that everyone seeks power to steal. Murderers think they need power to kill," the Minister said.
The Minister said the President has the power in accordance with the Constitution to appoint a commission to investigate any complaint.
"Commission is not a court. A man can be sentenced only by a court if that man was proven guilty," the Minister said.
Minister Atukorale said they had not stolen a cent from others.
"The cases against those corrupted delayed because the judicial system has as many as 650,000 cases to finish. Magistrates cannot finish all the cases they have at once. It takes time. That is why the cases delayed," the Minister said.
She said the public can ask to accelerate hearing cases and the government would respond to that request. Then we will arrange a way to accelerate the system and hear cases daily. "We have done enough for the two years; we do not have to exaggerate," the Minister said.

## Title: In the name of the Godfather

In the name of the Godfather
For much of the twentieth century, organized crime was only rarely the subject of serious academic and journalistic research. Films and novels seemed to deal with the subject in a much more sincere fashion. This was especially true of the United States in the 1940s and early 50s when Hollywood, inspired by writers like Raymond Chandler and Dashiel Hammett, developed the noir genre to explore the relationship between crime and politics. Later on, films such as The French Connection, The Godfather and Goodfellas not only succeeded at the box office but triggered a new wave of books and films dealing with this subject.
And yet this popular interest in the Mafia appeared to hold little attraction to sociologists, political scientists or economists. Eric Hobsbawm had opened up the subject to historians as early as 1959 with his study, Primitive Rebels, which proposed that, in many parts of the world, brigands were an expression of pre-industrial class struggle, critical in curbing feudal power; they later evolved into what we would today recognize as mafia organizations. The continuing relevance of Hobsbawms book today points in part to how few historians have built on his thesis.
Market economy
Things changed dramatically in the 1990s. The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union was accompanied by a drastic weakening of the state, unable and unfit to cope with the dramatic shift from a planned to a market economy. Those people engaged in Soviet and East European studies had no choice but to write about the emergent mafias of the late 1980s and 90s because they comprised one of three constituent parts of a new polity, along with the new class of oligarchs and what remained of state institutions. Ignoring the Russian mafia would have been akin to writing a history of the United States in the 1970s without mentioning the CIA, big business, the FBI or the Supreme Court.
As coherent policies started to melt in Russia, another equally important one was already coming into being elsewhere. The Big Bang of 1986, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatchers most important joint initiative, lifted restrictions on corporate capital movement. This persuaded the political elites of countries such as India, Brazil, China, Indonesia and South Africa to adjust and accept more open markets. To varying degrees, the commercial law systems of these countries found accommodating these changes a difficult challenge.
The conjuncture of these two historical moments with a specifically criminal development injected immense vigour into the business of organized crime. This was supercharged by Reagans affirmation of the disastrous War on Drugs at a time of rapid growth in cocaine consumption in certain markets during the 1980s, and later by an upsurge in heroin production and distribution in the first half of the 1990s as Afghanistans security situation deteriorated.
Minute detail
Federico Varese was among a number of young students in the 1990s whose doctoral research coincided with these events. He went to Perm, located halfway between Moscow and Novosibirsk, where he recorded in minute detail the emergence of the local mafia organization, eventually leading to his seminal work, The Russian Mafia (2001). Others were undertaking similar work in various countries including South Africa, China, Brazil and India.
Most framed their research with some reference to The Sicilian Mafia: The business of private protection (1993) by the Italian social scientist Diego Gambetta.
More than anyone elses, Gambettas work has changed our fundamental understanding of mafias and organized crime groups. Mafias usually emerge, he argues, at times of social or economic upheaval when the state finds itself unable or unwilling to regulate markets. In order to ensure the smooth running of commercial activities, mafias, or privatized law enforcement agencies as another researcher named them, assume the role of arbiter.
This role has confirmed the enormous political, economic and social importance of mafias, as anyone who grew up in post-war Italy, Japan or 1990s Russia will tell you. They are not just made up of romanticized gangsters. They compete seriously with the states claim to a monopoly on violence. Once they have established themselves as the arbiter of, say, the drugs or restaurant market in a particular area, they often but not always choose to enter that market themselves.
Varese has been taking the subject of organized crime with the seriousness it deserves for a quarter of a century. His latest excellent contribution, Mafia Life, examines the structures of the worlds most prominent mafia organizations by looking at how mafiosi lead their lives from cradle to grave.
Remarkable style
In his opening chapter, Birth, Varese compares the initiation rituals that are common to almost every mafia organization. He draws from interviews, autobiographies and police wiretap transcripts in which the gangsters do most of the talking. It is remarkable how close in style, substance and imagery the initiation ceremonies are across cultures  the religious symbolism, the use of tattoos, the omert, the misogyny and sealing of membership through blood are present among the Yakuza of Japan, the Russian mafia, the Chinese triads and the Sicilian Mafia.
Each chapter shines a new light on a fundamental aspect of mafia activity, whether it concerns managing and laundering profits, how to conduct a marriage or affair without revealing ones profession, or how most effectively to dispose of a body. Vareses chapter on Self-image in which he looks at the complex relationship of mafiosi to filmic or literary portrayals of their business, is superb. Unsurprisingly, The Godfather is the film most mobsters love above all others.
Varese concludes on an unexpectedly upbeat note.
The digital revolution, the global depression and a more savvy police strategy, he suggests, are eroding the power of mafia. The internet is fundamentally altering the nature of crime. A mafia cannot survive without the ability to deploy or credibly to threaten violence. But that logic does not apply to a cybercriminal gang. You do not need a virtual baseball bat to succeed  one reason why cybercrime attracts people with more diverse backgrounds than traditional crime ever can.
This is a profound shift. Equally important is the slow but steady progress in drug law reform in South America, the United States, Canada and some European countries.
This in part reflects a belated understanding of the damage caused by treating drugs as a criminal rather than a social and health problem. But it has also come about because the production of narcotics is shifting from its traditional loci, such as Bolivia and Afghanistan. Instead, synthetic drugs are being manufactured in laboratories rather closer to the consumer (i.e. Western Europe and the United States), and this is proving hard to police.
The growing decriminalization of marijuana is a first step in reducing the extent of the challenge.
And yet I wouldnt write off established mafias quite yet. Their primary role in organizing markets, legal and illegal, which the state are unable or unwilling to police, is still evident across the world.
Policing techniques are undoubtedly improving, but the impact of the financial crisis of 2008 has led to severe cutbacks in law enforcements ability to assert its authority throughout its jurisdiction.
From the United Kingdom to Brazil, from Japan to Egypt, mafias are alive and kicking.

Pitfalls in 5Ss and how to avoid them
After many years of experience in the manufacturing industries and successful implementation of lean practices in sixty companies and five national hospitals, decided to share my experiences regarding common pitfalls in 5Ss and how to avoid them.
It is with gratitude I recall the opportunities afforded to me by Japan Sri Lanka technical and Cultural Association and the Association for Overseas Technical Scholarship (AOTS ) Japan. The training in Japan and the expert guidance that helped me to enhance my own potential and make a positive contribution to improve Productivity is appreciated very much.
Collectively along with my clients we were able to raise the standard of the 5S system in Sri Lanka. Many innovative and practical solutions were found to improve the Key Performance Indicators of many companies with excellent corporate results.
Since incorporating M&S Associates (consultants) we successfully implemented 5S, Kaizen, Lean and several Japanese management techniques with excellent corporate results. We saw dramatic changes in production, quality, cost, delivery, safety and morale in many of these companies. They won many national and international awards.
Lesson No. 1 5S is not just housekeeping
My initial comprehension was that it is simply a method for improving organization and housekeeping. I figured that it was typically the first tool introduced in a Lean Transformation because it was easy to wrap one's mind around and was relatively safe that no person's job was impacted too drastically.
On the plus side 5S resulted in an immediate visual impact and eliminated the waste and frustration associated with employees searching for needed items. Thus, I saw it simply as a momentum builder and encourages team work.

While 5S is indeed a tool for improving workplace cleanliness, but its potential to improve key performance indicators such as production, quality, Cost, delivery, safety and morale, are enormous.
In many of my presentations on 5S we have explained the need to understand the concept and the importance of relating it to ones daily activities from the time you wake up in the morning. It is a way of life and how you set the days work ahead of you at home and at work.
To fully appreciate the fundamental nature of 5S to any Lean transformation, I find it useful to start with a little arithmetic; 3S + 2S = 5S.
The first three components of 5Ss are indeed about housekeeping. The fourth and the fifth Ss, however, are about establishing a culture of discipline around standard work. It is this reason that 5S is a foundational tool for all Lean transformations. Without establishing a culture that demonstrates the ability to establish standard work and sustain improvements, all future Lean progress will ultimately be a failure. In fact the Japanese lean experts believe this so strongly, that they refuse to let clients take the next step in the process until they have successfully demonstrated 5S for two years.
My own experience with many local clients is that we have allowed them to commence other Lean initiatives only on completion of 5S and good audit results exceeding 80 per cent effectiveness.
Lesson No. 2 5S is simple...but it's not easy the ideals of 5S are not complex:
Keep only what is needed at the workplace; keep it clean; store it in the most convenient location; establish clear, visual expectations for everyone to keep it in that condition and hold people accountable to those expectations.
But lets not confuse simplicity (the lack of complexity) with ease requiring little attention or lease effort. One needs to practice with commitment and consistency. The key word here is consistency. In the incredibly competitive business environment the managers should work with a high level of consistency in order to survive and face the challenges courageously.
Likewise, what makes 5S sustainment so difficult is the consistency with which it must be applied. In short, each and every instance of nonconformity that is identified must be addressed. Anything short of that allows for doubt and mixed signals to the workforce. One company was so good at this and their weekly audits proved to be a total success. They addressed all nonconformities highlighted by the audit teams.
A factory or office successfully practicing 5Ss makes it look effortless. The successful 5S organizations are committed to constant and continuous sorting, shining and setting in order. More importantly those organizations have the courage to risk episodes of interpersonal discomfort when a team member fails to live up to agreed standards. Fortunately, all of the skills required for a flourishing 5s organization can be learned and successfully applied if the desire exists. No innate traits are required.
Like almost all things requiring discipline (healthy diet, exercise, saving) 5S is easy to understand but difficult to practice. Communication should not over simplify the challenge. Ensure the organization understands the importance and magnitude of the effort. Start small, recognize successes, and leverage to larger areas.
Lesson No. 3 5S is not an event, it's a process
Organizations often kick off their lean implementations with basic training and perhaps a short 5S Kaizen focused on the initial cleanup of a scoped area. Before and After photos are taken to document the significant change, and almost everyone leaves feeling like they've accomplished something. Those good feelings, however, quickly erode to skepticism if the fourth and the fifth Ss are not practiced (SEIKETSU&SHITSUKE). The result is that the condition of the area steadily degrades, pulling down employees pride and enthusiasm with it. The entire Lean effort can be perceived as another program of the month.
While a 5S kaizen event is a possible trailhead for a continuous improvement Journey, great care must be taken in planning the event to ensure that all five components are adequately emphasized. Often, 5S kaizen agendas allot 80-90 percent, sometimes more, of the scheduled time to sort, showcase and set in order. Standardization and sustenance are treated as afterthoughts. This reinforces the myth that 5S is only about housekeeping and sets the continuous improvement journey off on precarious first leg.
A better allotment is to spend an equal amount of time on the final two components as is spent on the first three components. Dedicated time should be assigned to document expectations. Photos of both acceptable and unacceptable levels should be included. Also ensure that fixed point photos taken before and after improvements. In addition, agreement should be reached on how team members will satisfy expectations: Will 5s time be designated each shift Does adequate time exist within machine cycles to perform the necessary tasks
An adequate portion of the agenda should also be devoted to developing the fifth S (Shitsuke). Team members must articulate their expectations of each other and practice holding each other accountable. Standard work for supervisors is recommended so that their role is clear in addressing out-of-control situations. An audit process and visual management to monitor sustainment by the team and their supervisor must be developed, including leadership's duty to hold the supervisor accountable.
Finally, an agreed - to system should be established for making improvements to the initial standards as team members identify better locations for sorting, more efficient methods for cleaning and disposal etc. Items not needed are stored in the Red Tag Corner. These items are disposed of at regular intervals.
Review 5S kaizen pre-work to ensure the appropriate time and emphasis is placed on the standardization and sustaining components. Reinforce the importance of these components in kick-off comments, during the event, and at the reporting the progress. Recognize the improvements by refraining from mission accomplished type comments. Take an active role in auditing the audits.
Lesson No. 4 5S success depends almost entirely on leadership
Progressive leaders may often roll up their sleeves to help during the initial clean up or big Seiri day. In reality however, leaderships real work begins when the initial cleanup is completed.
That is because only leadership can ensure that a culture values the standardization and sustainment within their organization.Until those values are imbedded within the workforce, pursuing other lean tools which have an even greater impact on how work is accomplished (change-over, one-piece Flow, TPM) is fruitless.
For this reason it is important that all leaders, from front-line supervisors, to the senior leadership team members, understand their role in a continuous Improvement transformation. While a basic understanding of Lean principles is important, a clear image of leadership's responsibilities in the Lean environment is absolutely vital. One manager, upon hearing of the importance of auditing for improvement Complained, I am not interested in becoming a babysitter. One can wonder How someone in a leadership role capable of making such a remark could succeed in any organization, Lean or not. The point is, a key leadership responsibility in any setting - business, sports, charity- involves holding people accountable to the ideals and goals of the organization.
If the organization has not previously established a healthy results- oriented culture, leaders should be trained on coaching and holding employees accountable prior to embarking on 5S initiatives. Properly interacting with employees to provide feedback, both positive and negative, is the responsibility of a good leader.
Hopefully an organization eventually matures to a point where team members hold each other accountable to collectively established set of standards. This level will never be reached without leadership first modeling the behavior.
Lesson No. 5 Each 5S component has a common pitfall (learn to avoid them)
My experience with 5S implementation has revealed that there are very common mistakes. By being aware of these mistakes, the prudent leader can proactively design and implementation to ensure that their organization's execution is successful.
In the SEIRI stage, companies often underestimate the critical nature of an effective, ongoing Red Tag process. It is very hard for some people to part with items they believe have value, even though that value may not pertain to the area undergoing 5S initiatives. A working Red tag process offers these people a means of getting the item out of their area, while still recycling it to a place where it can add value.
A common flaw in the initial stage is not setting a high enough standard for the team. As a result many initial stages of 5Ss end up as pure cleaning and clearing only. The objective here is to restore the area to a good as new condition and may involve painting, rearranging, aligning, restoring the floor. Leaving more space than required to store only necessary items is a frequent oversight with the set in order stage.
There is some truth which can be applied to the work area from Boston's irreversible law of clutter which states, in any household, junk accumulates to fit the space available for its storage.
In the standardization stage, I often see standards that are too vague to be useful for anyone other than the author of the standards. Clear and precise Standards should include visual examples of both acceptable and unacceptable levels of adherence.
Finally leaders make unfounded assumptions in the sustenance stage that all team members are not on board and excited to comply with the new standards of the organization. The sad truth is that some people are very comfortable living in total disarray and return to it each day after work.
Learn from others mistakes:
l Sort - develop a bullet proof Red Tag process
l Showcase -Provide a clear expectation on the level of improvement desired....and the appropriate budget to allow it to happen
l set in order - use creativity to minimize space which can accumulate clutter, example replace a table which holds a fixture with a stand to hold the fixture
l Standardize - use someone from outside the work area to interpret standards to ensure clarity.
l Sustain - Audit from day 1 and ensure violators are held accountable including supervisors.
Lesson No. 6 5S is not important......it's essential!
The most common rationale for 5S is that an organized workplace improves Safety, quality, productivity and morale. These are good arguments, and they were enough to convince me that 5S was important, and worth doing .But now with more than 20 years experience, I know that 5S is more than important, it's essential for continuous improvement. Heres why:
Standardize and sustain are discipline dependant ideals. It's easy to sort, Showcase, and set in order, but to maintain the efficiencies that are created, People have to behave differently than they did in the past. It would be nice if behaviors would just change automatically, but it usually doesn't work that Way. It takes influence to change behaviors that have developed over time. It isn't always easy, but it can be done by leaders who have the skills and courage to do so.
So here is my point. Leaders who know how to Standardize and sustain by instilling discipline are well equipped to effectively utilize tools for continuous improvement. Why Because all lean tools are also discipline dependant. Here are a few examples:
When we create standard work we identify the best practices and document them as the standard for everyone to follow. Will they follow them just because we have created a standard Probably not. As with 5S, we have to ensure people are following the standards in order to sustain the improvements we make. Many have successfully used the SDCA cycle to ensure that the standards are adhered to. (Standardize, do, check, action)
Kanban is a fantastic tool to improve supply chain performance, but like 5S, and standard work, it requires discipline. Kanban cards must be moved at the right time and get filled in the right order for the system to work. Calculations must be regularly reviewed. These actions, while simple, are essential and require discipline.
With Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), we identify what needs to be done proactively and routinely to ensure that equipment is reliable and productive. People who are assigned TPM tasks are essential to the success of the TPM program. Their behaviors need to change after the TPM event has been completed.

The Body Shop Sri Lanka partnered with The Little Gym of Colombo to bring some Christmas joy and cheer to 25 young children and their caregivers. The evening of activities at The Little Gym gymnastics centre was attended by children from Shanthi Maargam and the Voice Foundation.
The children had an activity-filled evening at The Little Gym, with Director and CEO Shilpa Perera and the instructors teaching the kids gymnastic skills, and touching upon the importance of being a good citizen as a child, especially when it comes to sharing and taking turns. The enrichment and physical development centre for children aged four months to 12 years uses movement based learning and imaginative play to build confidence and skills in children.
The gymnastics was followed by a drama session by Power of Plays Sulochana Dissanayake where she touched upon respect and kindness through singing, dancing and storytelling using puppets as a medium.
In addition to the activities for the children, the event included a self-care workshop for caregivers of children at orphanages and day centres conducted by Tehani Chitty and Seema Omar. The partnering exercise saw each caregiver share with another, what drew them to this work and the joy they find in their role.
The Body Shops Colombo community service projects this year are complementary to its global Play for Peace campaign, an initiative that allows customers to help refugee children when they buy seasonal gifts from The Body Shop. This campaign is conducted by The Body Shop in partnership with peace building NGO International Alert, and supports refugee children by using recreational and creative activities to help them deal with trauma and understand their experience of conflict. Each gift purchased from The Body Shops seasonal gift collections will help to support the project for one year in the Shatila refugee camp in Beirut, Lebanon.

The Dematagoda Police Traffic Division in a letter of appreciation to the Directorate of Army Training at the Army Headquarters has commended a soldier.
He was appreciated for supporting in arresting a fleeing driver knocking down a vendor who was crossing the road near the Mount Mary Junction along the Baseline Road.
Lance Corporal M.A.N.P.T Manathunga of 11 Sri Lanka Signal Corps (SLSC), attached to the Directorate of Training at the Army Headquarters, was in the Dematagoda area along the Baseline Road on December 12, 2017 around 4.15 pm when he spotted a king coconut vendor crossing the road pushing his cart, being knocked down by a speeding car.
The soldier immediately attended to the victim, carried him to the roadside and sent him to hospital. Then he chased the car on his motorcycle, neared the car and provided its number to the police officers serving near the Orugodawatta Junction.
Then he roughed to the Colombo National Hospital only to witness that the victim had already died. Corporal Manathunga then visited Dematagoda Police and provided the details about the car to police.
Following information given by the soldier, the driver was arrested.
The Police in the letter pointed out that the soldier is "a pride to the Army and a role model to the civil society".

Prevailing plight of the land of Spice
Sri Lanka has always been known as the Island of Spices, but today, the industry faces a number of challenges, many of which are common to the slow deaths of numerous traditional industries, from handicrafts to cultivation.
Those engaged in the spice industry are both smallholders and large-scale cultivators. The Matale district, which is a hub for spices, has suffered great losses during recent times, mainly due to the sharp drop in the prices of spicesespecially that of pepper.
Grief of pepper cultivators
J. L. M. Maharoof is one of the many smallholder pepper cultivators living in Matale. His main livelihood is derived from the sale of pepper to those who visit his cultivation. Prior to the downward trend in pepper prices, he had previously sold a kilogram of pepper at prices between Rs. 1,400 and Rs. 1,500, but currently, a kilogram of pepper only fetches Rs. 600less than half of the usual price, he said.
Maharoof, like many other pepper cultivators, now have to find other alternatives to make a living.
The government is yet to take any measures to improve the price of Sri Lankan pepper in the local market, he added.
D. S. Samaraweera of Ukuwela in Matale, in the meantime, said he could no longer afford to hire workers at his pepper cultivation, as the cost of labour and the price of organic fertilizer for his cultivation made production costs too high to be profitable.
Bandula Karunaratne of Udurawana, Wattegama in Matale said he had cultivated 43 acres of pepper and provided employment to many in the area, but since the drop in prices, he has found it difficult to maintain his cultivations.
The spice trade is mainly run by the private sector; we see very little attention being paid by the government to revive the industry, said Karunaratne.
A majority of his workers have left for other jobs and for the time being, he has diverted his efforts to develop his coconut cultivation.
Ginger still underground
When it came to ginger, Sarath Kumara of Diddeniya in Melsiripura, Kurunegala, grew ginger seedlings to be sold to other farmers. His seedlings could be sold for Rs. 800 per kilogram, and he was looking to get into the export market.
Kumaras main complaint was that the Export Development Board did not provide much support for their exports.
No systematic steps had been taken so far to expand ginger cultivation and encourage people in the district to cultivate gingera spice which is in high-demand in the world market, he added.
Spice gardens; a tourist trap
Ruwandi Perera, who was trained in Australia and Malaysia on Business Management, is the owner of the Euphoria Spice Garden in Matale. She revealed that many of the guides employed at spice gardens, spoil the countrys reputation by giving wrong information on spices to foreign tourists.
These self-proclaimed guides know nothing about the ingredients or the diversity of essential oils found in spices. They should be given proper training on spices and their food and medicinal values, she further said.
Perera requested that authorities such as the Sri Lanka Tourist Board and the Export Agriculture Department should step in to rescue the spice trade in Sri Lanka.
If proper action was not taken, Sri Lanka could soon disappear from the map of spice islands, she added.
Reasons behind the decline
When inquiries were made regarding the situation of spices and the low prices paid for pepper in the export market, Kandy Gatambe Export Agricultural Department Director General Dr. A. T. Heenkenda said Sri Lanka provided only five percent of pepper to the world market.
He added that steps would be taken to recover a better price and to further improve the country's local and international spice trade.
Media reports from Vietnam show that the trade imbalance is also affecting its own farmers. Last week, the Vietnamese media reported that pepper growers entering the harvest season of 2018 in the southeastern region of Vietnam, were concerned about the price fall and output reduction because of pests and diseases.
Traders now pay VND 65,000 - VND 66,000 for a kilogram of pepper, accounting for half of the price in the same period last year, they further reported.
Long-lasting rains last year created conditions for pests and diseases to attack pepper crops, resulting in an output drop this year.
According to statistics, high pepper prices in previous years sent farmers to expand their farming areas to 40,100 hectares in the Ba Ria-Vung Tau, Dong Nai, and Binh Phuoc provinces in 2017. The area far exceeds the plan of of the Vietnamese government, which was to be 12,800 hectares by 2020.
That has broken the supply and demand balance, causing continuous price reductions for the last two years, said Vietnamese media reports.
Mid last year, Sri Lankan pepper cultivators too took to the streets in protests of falling pepper prices. At the time, they blamed the governments policy of the excessive importation of pepper over the fall in local pepper prices.
However, an overall look at the industry and a national policy to bring about changes, thus, would impact the spice trade for the better in the countryonce again making it the Indian Oceans hub of spices.

Point of view 
Profit-taking dominated equity markets this week, with the broad-share market index wiping off ~41 points off its 191 point gain over the last two weeks.
The ASPI hit the key psychological mark of 6500 for the 1st time in 2 months last week, prompting investors to take profits and helping the Index consolidate at the current levels.
The benchmark ASPI consequently dropped below the key 6500-mark on Thursday to close the week at 6473 points.
Market activity levels meanwhile remained broadly unchanged from last week, with average daily turnover at Rs. 0.83Bn this week cf. Rs. 0.92Bn last week and Rs. 0.30Bn in the last two weeks of December.
Market activity levels were propped largely by strong HNI and institutional participation, which accounted for ~60% of total market turnover for the second consecutive week.
Investor interest in blue-chips continued to dominate crossings, with JKH accounting for 30% of total crossings while COMB accounted for 28% of total crossings for the week. Foreign inflows to the Colombo Bourse meanwhile slowed somewhat this week, declining ~82% from last weeks notable net inflow of Rs.2.0Bn.
Nevertheless, the steady foreign interest in domestic stocks has helped the net inflows in just the 1st two weeks of 2018 hit ~13% of the 2017 total of Rs. 17.7Bn. The net inflows of Rs. 2.3Bn in Jan18 contrast sharply to the net outflows to Rs. 1.6Bn recorded in Jan17. Average net monthly foreign inflows to the CSE in 2017 was Rs. 1.5Bn, up from the average net monthly foreign inflow to Rs. 0.03Bn in 2016, and indicating the stronger interest in domestic equities on the back of the global rally in EM/FM risky assets.
Markets in the holiday-shortened trading week ahead are likely to consolidate at the current levels, although some further profit taking is also likely.
Foreign holdingsof G-sec holdingsfall marginally 
Foreign holdings of G-sec holdings at the start of 2018 fell marginally to $2.09Bn, down 1.8% from the 2017 close of $2.13Bn.
Foreign holdings of G-sec holdings have recovered gradually since Mar17, helped largely by the general recovery in global risk appetite for Debt in EM/FM markets over 2017.
Greater stability in the domestic economy also aided demand, helping push up foreign holdings of G-Secs from a 3-year low of $1.29Bn in Mar17 when the US Fed raised rates for the 3rd time in a decade and the CBSL initiated its only policy rate increase for the year (to $2.13Bn by Dec17).
The CBSL meanwhile, detailed measures it has taken thus far to make bond markets more transparent and accountable, adding that it would study the report of the Commission of Inquiry to Investigate, Inquire and Report on the Issuance of Treasury Bonds (COI) during Feb15-Mar16 to initiate further action if necessary.
The Monetary Authority added that most of the measures recommended in the report have already been implemented while measures have already been initiated to implement most of the reports other recommendations.
The CBSL added that legislative amendments such as the new Liability Management Act (which will give flexibility for active debt management initiatives while minimizing rollover risk of the underlying debt stock by altering the maturity profile of the outstanding debt stock) is expected to come into force in early 2018.
The CBSL also outlined measures taken/being taken to increase the efficiency and transparency of debt management operations and improve the transparency and governance of the Investment Decision Making Process and internal control framework of the EPF.

Railway line beyond Matara a reality once more
A railway line beyond Matara, a dream for over a century, is becoming a reality as Public Enterprise Development State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, together with many other dignitaries associated with the project, tightened the stays on the first length of track laid by the China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC) on Friday (12) morning.
Among the dignitaries who attended the ceremony were CMC Vice President Zhao Jun and Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB) Chairman Eng. G. D. A. Piyathilake, who are the project consultants on behalf of the Ministry of Transport (MOT); Cao Lianghua of the China Railway No. 5 Group (CR5G), Zhang Yongkang of the China Railway Electrification Company (CREC), Fu Zhigen of the China Railway 5th Survey and Design Institute Group, Southern Railway Extension Project CMC Project Manager He Peizhi and other Chinese and localofficials.
The dream of a railway extension beyond Matara has a history of more than a century, said researcher and author Dhanesh Wisumperuma in his blog Diary and writings of Dhanesh Wisumperuma. According to him, research based on available documents suggest that it was in 1894, a year before the Galle  Matara railway was opened, that the Colonial Government Auditor General James A. Swettenham had mentioned the need of extending the line beyond Matara.
The project to construct a railway line beyond Matara first got off the ground on December 27, 1991, with the then Transport Minister Wijepala Mendis laying the foundation stone and cutting the first sod of earth. A brief history of the Matara  Kataragama extension in chronological order, according to Dhanesh Wisumperuma, is as follows:
* November, 1894: the survey of the Matara - Gandara Extension was ordered.
* April, 1895: the Gandara Railway Report was submitted with stations at Dondra and Gandara. (5 miles and 52.7 chains at Rs. 130,811.62 per mile).
* December, 1895, Galle: the Matara Railway was opened.
* November, 1921: a Matara - Hambanthota survey was carried out.
* Hambanthota in 1923: a railway report was submitted, with stations at Kumbalgama, Walasgala, Beliatta, Polommaruwa, Ranna, Ambalantota, and Hambantota and two halting places at Ratmale and Hungama. (49 miles and 56 chains, at a maximum of Rs. 160,459.23 a mile).
* 1990: the Sri Lankan government approved construction of the Matara  Kataragama Railway Extension.
* December 27, 1991: the foundation was laid and the first sod was cut by the then Transport Minister Wijepala Mendis.
* June, 1993: an environmental assessment was submitted.
* 2001: The Piladuwa sub-station and a 2km-track was opened by the then Transport and Environment Minister Dinesh Gunawardena. The track was used on a few occasions, but later abandoned.
* March 25, 2006: the foundation stone for the Nilwala Railway Bridge was laid by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. (the bridge was completed in 2008).
Every time the southern railway extension project got off the ground, it could not be completed due to lack of funds, until the Chinese Government agreed to fund it. On October 31, 2013, the construction work of Phase I of the Matara  Beliatta section of the proposed Matara  Kataragma Railway Extension, with stations at Kekanadura, Bambarenda, Wewurukannala, and Beliatta and two sub-stations at Piladuwa and Weharahena, was handed over to the China National Machinery Import and Export Corporationa Chinese government entity. The project, which cost US$ 278.2 million, was funded by the China Exim Bank.
President Maihripala Sirisena is keen on commencing Phase II of the southern railway extension once the Matara  Beliatta railway line is operative, said Public Enterprise Development State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena at a ceremony held to lay the railway track beyond the Matara station, last Friday.
In Phase I, the 26.75-kilometer Matara  Beliatta railway extension comprises of four stations and two sub-stations, covering a total floor area of 24,000 square meters, 66 culverts, 12 bridges totaling 3,789 metres in length, two tunnels totaling 882 metres in length, and 3.4 million cubic meters of earthwork. The 615-metre long Nakuttiyagama tunnel would be the longest railway tunnel in the island, while the 1.5-kilometre long Wattegama Bridge would be the longest railway bridge, as much as the 15-metre tall Weralagoda Bridge would be the tallest railway bridge. Phase II of the Southern Railway Extension is from Beliatta to Hambanthota; a distance of 48 kilometres.
We are privileged to be associated with the Southern Railway Extension Project as its consultants, said CECB Chairman Eng. G. D. A. Piyathilake. The CECB will cooperate with the main contractor to complete Phase I within this year. The Southern Railway Extension would be a landmark project when it becomes operative, he added.
I wish to express our deep appreciation to State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena present here today and Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, who was unable to attend the ceremony, the representatives from the Chinese government and the Chinese Exim Bank, and all of you who have supported us and are present here today, said CMC Vice President Zhao Jun in his address.
The southern railway extension from Matara to Kataragama is a key project for the development of Sri Lanka, as it would link the new industrial zone in Hambanthota and the sacred city of Kataragama. It would reach far for positives of the economy and the social development of Sri Lanka and would also consolidate the friendship, understanding, and cooporation between the people and governments of Sri Lanka and China. I have the fullest confidence that with the support of all the stakeholders, the project would be completed in less than 10 months, he added.

Railways on the right track
Here is startling fact: Apart from a brief extension from Anuradhapura to Mihintale, not a single metre of railway has been added to the local railway system during the last 70 years. In other words, we are still dependent on the tracks laid during the colonial period. In fact, we somehow managed to destroy an existing line from Avissawella to Opanaike, with the result that trains cannot now go beyond Avissawella on the Kelani Valley Line.
To be fair, all Governments did want to expand the railway network, which provides some of the most scenic and alluring rail journeys in Asia. But this could not be achieved due to monetary considerations and the lack of political will. Things are at last moving on the right track this time, with the commencement of the first phase of the China-built Matara-Kataragama railway extension project.
The first phase of the project includes constructing a railway line from Matara to Beliatta. State Minister for State Enterprise Development Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena has been quoted as saying that the Government hoped to finish the first phase of the railway project in the coming months, which will benefit both local travellers and tourists.
This is a project that many Governments wanted to implement but the lack of funds stood in the way. We should thus be grateful to the people and the Government of China for coming forward to fund and build this very important railway line, which will be extended all the way to the holy city of Kataragama. The project, funded by the EXIM Bank of China on a concessional loan, is being constructed by China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation in consultation with the Sri Lankan Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation and the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau.
The only other railway project that can match this one in scope and scale is the reconstruction of the Northern railway line with the assistance of the Indian Government. This railway line has once again connected the North and the South of the country, boosting efforts at national unity and reconciliation. Trains already run from KKS to Matara and will soon run to Kataragama, connecting the two extreme nodes of the country.
For a country that covers only 65,610 Sq Km, Sri Lanka does have an extensive rail network exceeding 1560 Km with over 320 stations. Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) is also one of the biggest State sector employers, with a workforce of over 17,000. Statistics show that more than 300,000 people use trains daily. Still, there is much room for improvement in terms of network expansion and ridership.
The Kataragama extension will go a long way towards fulfilling the objective of network expansion, but there is one drawback that impedes real progress in the railway sector  the lack of electrification. We have been talking about electrifying the railways right from 1948, without any tangible results.
Electrification will bring many improvements  higher speeds, lack of noise and fumes, more stability and easier maintenance. We are seeing some action on this front at last  the Government plans to go ahead with the electrification of the busy corridor from Veyangoda to Panadura soon. The key to increasing the ridership figures is offering faster, more comfortable, cleaner trains. Electrification will make this a reality.
The biggest demand for the railway is from urban areas and this is where the planned Light Rail Transit (LRT) system comes in. Around seven routes have been planned, centred on Colombo. The first LRT line, from Malabe to Colombo, will be built with Japanese assistance and work is slated to begin this year. This line, as well as the proposed Piliyandala-Colombo line, are significant because both areas are currently not served by a railway line. The other major advantage of the LRT is that people who currently use cars for their daily commute to work will have a clean and fast public transport alternative. One can just imagine the savings in terms of fuel and man hours if at least 100 cars are taken off the road at rush hour.
There should also be a greater focus on rail freight  just one train can replace eight to nine container prime movers. SLR will soon purchase six power sets, 10 engines, 30 oil tankers and 20 container type wagons to transport coal and flour. This is a step in the right direction. Big companies with huge cargo requirements should be encouraged to try rail freight.
In the meantime, the Government deserves plaudits for improving the existing railway network with a recent order for more power sets and A/C passenger compartments. Plans are afoot to build more automatic motorized gates at level crossings to prevent collisions with motor vehicles.
The railway authorities should also be alive to the latest developments in Mass Transit systems such as the Hyperloop which is already being tested in the US. The idea is based on firing levitating pods, carrying passengers or cargo through nearly airless tubes, at speeds up to 1,000 Kmph. In the railway sector, the future has already arrived.

Real caught in a storm after Villarreal defeat
MADRID, Saturday: Real Madrid defender Dani Carvajal said his side were in the eye of a tornado after succumbing to a second successive home defeat in the La Liga by losing 1-0 to Villarreal on Saturday, but he was at a loss to explain his sides predicament.
Real had nearly triple the amount of shots on goal as Villarreal and also had Cristiano Ronaldo hit the woodwork twice at a rainswept Santiago Bernabeu, but Pablo Fornalss 87th minute strike inflicted a third home defeat on the floundering champions this season.
This wasnt about a lack of focus, the ball just didnt want to go in, Carvajal told reporters.
The result doesnt reflect what happened in the 90 minutes as we played a complete first half and could have been several goals up. Tiredness caught up with us in the second half but we still had more chances than them.
Real are fourth in the Liga standings and only one point ahead of Villarreal, while runaway leaders Barcelona could stride a remarkable 19 points clear of Zinedine Zidanes side if they beat Real Sociedad on Sunday.
This is very difficult for us, it seems like everything is bad at the moment and we are in the middle of a tornado, but I think deep inside we are strong and we believe in each other, but anyone who doesnt should get off the boat, Carvajal added.
Last season Real became the first team since 1991 to successfully defend the Champions League and also swept to the Liga title but they appear to have paid the price for not freshening up their squad and failing to replace departing forwards James Rodriguez and Alvaro Morata.
Real scored in 73 consecutive games across 16 months between April 24, 2016 and Sept. 20, 2017 but they have drawn a blank in five games this season, while Saturdays defeat marked the first time since 2000 they had lost back-to-back home games in the league in which they had also failed to score.
Its very difficult to explain what is going on, everyone in the dressing room feels awful, but this is football, the team that scores more goals wins and today that was Villarreal, Carvajal said.
We seem fine physically and we are still training hard, we dont know what has happened.
Theres no problem with our attitude, we are practically the same squad and have the same desire, but were just not getting the results.

## Title: Rearing kids with the sharing, caring touch

Rearing kids with the sharing, caring touch
Sharing means caring - this is one of the most important rules a child can learn when growing up. Teaching your child how to share will make him or her well-loved by other people around them and can help in developing better relationships with friends and those that come into their life, whether that be a day, a week, a month or a lifetime.
Kids naturally think that once they have something in their hands, it can be considered theirs and theirs alone. Surely they must know their infantile legal rights where possession is deemed nine tenths of the law! It's mine! you hear them cry. Keep in mind, if your child lives in an environment where they see people doing the same thing, they will grow up thinking that it's really no big deal. Remember, the old monkey see, monkey do adage Children have difficulty sharing, especially young children. This is a normal part of the development process.
I recall once when grand-daughter Keshini was around two she insisted that I carry her. While her older cousins were playing nearby she attracted their attention by thumping my back and yelling: Hey! Mine! This mine! Her cousins gave me the charge hugging my waist and countering her claim. It ended in hilarity and laughs all round.
Knowing and accepting this is the first step in helping your child grow up to be a generous person. The power to possess is a natural part of the child's growing awareness. During the second and third years, as the child goes from oneness to separateness, this little person works to establish an identity separate from mother. I do it myself! and mine! scream the headlines in the toddler's tabloid mind. In fact, mine is one of the earliest words to come out of a toddler's mouth. The growing child develops attachments to things as well as persons. This ability to form strong attachments is important to being an emotionally healthy person.
The one-year-old has difficulty sharing her mommy; the two-year-old has difficulty sharing her teddy bear. Some children get so attached to a toy that the raggedy old doll becomes part of the child's self. When asked to draw a picture of herself, four-year-old Moya would always include her doll - as if it were part of her body. Can you imagine convincing her to share this doll with a playmate It was too important. She could not feel safe and secure if that doll was being handled by another child.
It pays dividends to start them young. From the time your child can grasp an object, you can teach sharing by passing the object back and forth while saying my turn, your turn. Learning how to take turns is the first step in sharing.
True sharing implies empathy, the ability to get into another's mind and see things from their viewpoint. Children are seldom capable of true empathy under the age of six. Prior to that time they share because you condition them to do so. Don't expect a child less than two or 21/2 to easily accept sharing. Children under two are into parallel play - playing alongside other children, but not with them.
They care about themselves and their possessions and do not think about what the other child wants or feels. But, given guidance and taught munificence, the selfish two-year-old can become a generous three or four-year-old. As children begin to play with each other and cooperate in their play, they begin to see the value of sharing and its advantages.
While we don't expect toddlers to be able to share, we must use every opportunity we can to encourage taking turns. Teach your children how to communicate their needs to friends. Say something like, When Carmilla is all done with the bike, then you can ride it. Ask her when she will be done or Hold out your hand and wait; she'll give you the doll when she's ready.
When a toy squabble begins, sometimes it's wise not to rush in and interfere. Give children time and space to work it out among themselves. Stay on the sidelines and observe the struggle.If the group dynamics are going in the right direction and the children seem to be working the problem out among themselves it would be wise to remain a bystander. If the situation is deteriorating, intervene. Self-directed learning - with or without a little help from caregivers - has the most lasting value.
But, if your child lives in an environment where people share and speak to them about how important it is to share, they will grow up believing it is a natural occurrence. And if they see the enjoyment you have of sharing with other people, you will find the same attitude will be instilled in your child.
Teaching your child how to share can be fun. You don't think so Well make it fun! After all, children learn by watching others, and as your child's special role model you can do it in simple ways. For example: Share what you have with your child, as an instance, if you are munching on your favorite chocolate.
At the same time, tell them why you did it and how they can do the same in similar situations with their friends. Have a special story ready to tell them about sharing. Make it funny but ensure it has a special moral about someone who didn't share and what the consequences were.
Don't forget to compliment your child when they share. Say thank you or very good. It will encourage them to share more often if they know they are appreciated and valued because of it. Etiquette is all about building good relationships. Children need to learn how to act in ways that are respectful, considerate, and honest - the fundamental principles of etiquette and building strong relationships with family and friends.
But how young can we go Can toddlers learn concepts like respect and consideration While toddlers may not understand principles and concepts, children this age can learn some basic behaviour patterns that are fundamental to developing strong relationships. Most three year olds, for example, are able to understand that sharing and caring make the other person feel good.
They know this because they can see the smiles that sharing and caring bring. A smile is concrete. Toddlers can see the results of positive behaviour in the smiles. And they can identify with the feeling they get from making someone else smile - it makes them smile too. It will take much patience, repetition, and good modeling on your part to teach your toddlers to share and care. But hang in there. It's well worth it.

Roy record inspires England to victory vs Australia
MELBOURNE, Sunday: Opener Jason Roy recorded the highest-ever one-day international score by an England player as the tourists finally had something to celebrate with a five-wicket win over Australia on Sunday.
After their wretched Ashes campaign, in which they were beaten 4-0, the tourists chased down a hefty Australian total at the Melbourne Cricket Ground to win with seven balls to spare in the opener of the five-match ODI series.
Set 305 to win, Roy's daring 180 helped England make 308 for five.
The successful chase was also a record for a one-day international at the MCG, eclipsing Australia's 297 for four against England in 2011, and vindicated captain Eoin Morgan's decision to bowl first.
Having been an onlooker for the Test series, Roy was an unlikely hero. But he rode his luck to produce a record in limited-overs cricket for England and also a new benchmark for a batsman at the MCG in a one-day international.
The swashbuckling right-hander lived dangerously throughout his innings, charging along at better than a run a ball and reaching his half-century off only 32 balls. He survived a run-out scare and an lbw decision which was overturned upon review, and lofted several balls just out of the reach of frustrated Australian fielders on the way to his fifth ODI century. Roy was just five when Mitchell Starc could have run him out with a direct hit. He duly punished the Australian fast bowler by taking 14 off his next over as the tourists raced past 50 in the fifth over.
He was seemingly trapped lbw by 91 by spinner Adam Zampa on 91, but a review showed the ball hit him outside the line of off stump and the decision was overturned.
Roy wasted little time making the most of that piece of fortune, driving the next ball just over a leaping Aaron Finch on the long-on boundary for six. He reached his hundred just moments later from 92 balls, with nine fours and three sixes.
Fittingly, the 27-year-old passed team-mate Alex Hales's England record knock of 171 against Pakistan in 2016 with a chip just over the head of a despairing Australian fielder.
He finally fell to Starc after skying one into the outfield, having faced 151 balls -- hitting 16 fours and five sixes.
Roy was still coming to terms with his achievement after the match.
"Incredibly special, I don't have too many words right now," he said. "Halesy was pretty disappointed."
Australian captain Steve Smith praised Roy for his bold knock. "He didn't give us a chance, and he chanced his arm," Smith said. "They got off to an absolute flyer and we couldn't pull them back."
Roy had a willing partner in Test captain Joe Root, who had been tormented all tour by the Australians and was in no mood to let a rare victory slip. Root made an unbeaten 91 and he and Roy put on 221 -- an English ODI record -- for the third wicket.
Aaron Finch's ninth one-day international century was the cornerstone of the Australian total of 304 for eight. Finch's 107 was backed by half-centuries for Mitchell Marsh (50) and Marcus Stoinis (60) as Australia recovered from a shaky start in which the tourists finally managed to get bogeyman Steve Smith cheaply.

Shifting from barbarous political culture
Sri Lanka has become the homeland for the Buddhist Doctrine as wished by the Gautama Buddha. He is said to have blessed this country thrice. His first visit to this island has taken place on a Duruthu Full Moon Poya day like on the first day of January 2018, just passed. Buddhism in this island nation is surrounded by Hinduism from India, Christianity from Rome and Islam from Mecca in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. All these religious denominations wish peace, harmony, unity and coexistence bearing with and sharing out among all.
When the countrymen celebrated the dawn of the new year, there was an unanticipated peace, joy and happiness among them and calmness and quietness all over the country except for the usual donts that took place under Dutch courage when crapulent played havoc with participants amidst the festivities in some parts of the country owing to delirium tremens (DT) ending up in hospitals and police stations. Coincidentally, the Full Moon Poya day fell on the day when Christians were to celebrate the solemnity of Virgin Mary, the Mother of Lord Jesus Christ. But, devotees of both religions attended to their religious rites and rituals in unison and in silence. Thats called cooperation which is vital for maintaining harmony. It further substantiated that the feeling of hatred towards religions that existed from primordial times has ended. Therefore, the beginning of this year is auspicious and we can look forward to precious changes that would lead the country to prosperity through collective efforts.
Centenary celebration
The spectacular event that followed on January 03rd was the centenary celebration of the Ceylon Daily News turned Daily News. During the days of the British planters in this country, the Ceylon Daily News and the Ceylon Observer by D R Wijewardena and the Times of Ceylon by Donald Ranaweera were the three English newspapers read in the estate sector too. My father as one of the few local planters among the Europeans in the Kegalle district when Pilapitiya brothers were planters in the hill country received these three newspapers every day. The Tappal Cooly, (the estate sector usage during colonial times for a postman or a messenger in the outer world, the English version of Thavaal for Mail and Cooly for the labourer in Tamil) had to walk miles ascending and descending hills to go to a remote town to bring the newspapers and the mail. The man who went in the a.m. returned in the p.m. Unlike today by a click in a moment even before the sun rises today, we read newspapers in that era in the afternoons. It was in 1949 that at the age of ten my father gave me a copy of the Ceylon Daily News to read.
I remember it carried in its first page a cabinet size photograph of Lord Herwald Ramsbotham Soulbury, the first Governor General of independent Ceylon (Sri Lanka now) in pure white ceremonial dress walking up to board the white horse-drawn chariot which drew him to the Kings house escorted by mounted police in white uniform. I must make mention that I was present with my father standing on the left passage of the Mackinnon Mackinze building in the adjacency of the Grand Oriental Hotel when Lord Soulbury came out of the harbour and walked up to the chariot. Unlike today in any event important or not, big or small there were few spectators, not a huge curious crowd, to grace the occasion.
This newspaper was so respected that during the days when Christian Missionaries were our teachers we students were directed to read the Editorial to learn prcis writing. Since then, it became my paper too.
The Daily News has retained its popularity and prestige until it reached its 100th anniversary and, it will continue to prosper. Men may come and men may go but, I go on forever is what the triumphant lakeside Daily News which among other publications has taken the pride of place, say today.
May you be surrounded by councils of Advisers and multitude of the literati and lead you to infinity enabling you to provide the unending readership with crme de la crme of journalism.
Local Government election
On the eve of our bidding farewell to 2017 and transmigration to 2018, a statement was made by the President Maithripala Sirisena in the form of a deterrent that he will be tremendous and act drastically on the local government election contestants, their sympathizers or others who breach election laws and rules of correct behaviour during the period of local government elections with no considerations. This meant that the long - drawn implementation of election laws have at long last come to life. This realization is welcome.
The Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya not only has taken instructions he has also taken up the cudgels to execute a huge responsibility of wiping out a barbarous political culture. As a public servant who has proved his loyalty and efficiency the Election Commission Chairman has taken bold steps and risks during the last few days to ensure that election laws are implemented to the letter preventing intimidation, threat and thuggery on the voters by politicians and constituents in alliance with them and violent campaigning among themselves too. He is in the field directing his subordinates to go in line with the chapters, sections and subsections of the election enactment.
In support of his indefatigable involvement, the police have read the riot act wherever it became necessary. As a result, a peaceful environment has set in. By this, we have seen the end of a deep-seated menace and, all involved are compelled to conduct their campaigns ethically this time for the first time in the election history which we must determine to continue to establish a new political culture for civilized people.
The amalgamation of the United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party was proposed in the fifth decade of the past century when we had an opposition full of pugnacious and sanguinary leftists who were hell-bent to destroy democracy. During the premiership of SWRD Bandaranaike situation worsened when they did not allow him to work restfully, peacefully and sensibly on any day creating a strike every day to paralyse his administration. It went on until his tragic demise. The fruition of this proposal for amalgamation has been decided by the time as a need of the era has been implemented through the Premier Ranil Wickremasinghe, took effect in 2015 but, its not well coupled. It has taken donkeys years to come up to this junction at snails pace and at this juncture the need to act decisively to impress upon every denizen in every household in each and every constituency about the responsibility of the citizens to think responsibly and cast their votes to establish a consensus government unanimously to end the seventy years old tug-of-war.
Eliminate corrupt elements
All of us excluding the corrupt have decided to eradicate corruption and eliminate corrupt elements. With this view in mind, the two main parties have nominated their candidates and as confirmed by them every individual has been selected after a positive vetting. This means that there is a guarantee about our having in the local bodies people with clean habits in the future.
The local government bodies should not be allowed to function as independent bodies. They have the independence to work independently but, that should be subject to supervision. They have to report to somebody and they have to account for their actions since it is the first level in this administration from where the progress of the country and accountability begins. There is a Cabinet minister for the local government. At present, he sits in the ministry and talks in the house. If he is empowered and adequately powerful and, if a carte blanche is given to him why is he not acting as a taskmaster This is a shortcoming descending from the previous regimes. A definite change must come after this election primarily with regard to the performances of Pradeshiya Sabhas not leaving other councils too, alone.
The regular presence of the minister in all these premises, his guidance, directions and intervention will certainly enthuse and activate them enabling the minister to make use of them profitably during their next tenure of office.
The politicians are enthusiastically in the field canvassing but, the people are not. The bewildered they are observant this time because the requests they honoured to vote for the politicians in the past who visited them in full European kits like inflated generalissimos and others in the so-called pure white in colour national dress with thread wrapped in their wrists like ascetics have failed to satisfy them. Many have failed, not all. So, the corrupt politicians in sheeps clothing should beware of the voters. This information is noteworthy.

The Sirisena Presidency in midterm
The third anniversary of the assumption of office of by President Sirisena passed with little fanfare, overshadowed perhaps by impending local council elections. Just after the anniversary, the President referred to the Supreme Court for a determination, whether his term of office, post the 19th Amendment was for five or six years, resulting in his term running through either January 2020 or 2021.
Irrespective of the length of the term, the Maithri yugaya or era as some political commercials in his favour requested voters to select, is now at its midway mark and a time for the nation to look back and reflect on the journey we have come since 2015.
The victory of Sirisena three years ago was not wholly unexpected to political analysts, this writer included. The attraction of the Rajapaksa Administration to solely the majority community meant it was vulnerable. The Uva Provincial Council elections in mid-2014 indicated that in the Monaragala District which is close to 99% Sinhala, that Rajapaksas support had dipped to the mid-fifties. Savvy political leaders, such as former President Kumaratunga then created a remarkable rainbow coalition, which saw off the Rajapaksa Administration.
Defeated Rajapaksa attempts a comeback
The most notable feature of the Maithri era has been the attempts by his two-term predecessor to make a political comeback, a political misfortune which none of President Sirisenas predecessors faced. This despite the fact that President Rajapaksa cannot again hold the office of president, as per the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
The most notable feature of the Sirisena / Wickremesinghe Administration is that it reversed a disastrous slide by Sri Lanka down a slippery slope of being an authoritarian kleptocracy. As one analyst noted, Sri Lanka must have been the only multi-party democracy in the world which was heading towards an elected monarchy. Governance has declined to such depths, that despite the most strident of majoritarian ethnoreligious nationalist rhetoric, the Rajapaksa political project crash landed in January 2015. The attempts to resurrect the Rajapaksa brand would have mixed results as the local government elections next month will demonstrate. The disagreement over succession within the Rajapaksa family and the attraction of the Joint Opposition and the Rajapaksa to only a section of the majority community places a limitation on the SLPP and the Rajapaksa return project.
A reform agenda
President Sirisena was elected as the Common Candidate contesting from essentially a special purpose political vehicle of the National Democratic Front (NDF). The broad coalition of political and social forces which formed the NDF were strong advocates of a reform agenda which included reform of the executive presidency, democratic reforms, economic reforms and reconciliation. The Administration certainly made significant changes and progress in its early days. The 19th Amendment to the Constitution and the Right to Information Act are perhaps the landmark political reforms the Sirisena / Wickremesinghe Administration introduced which certainly did make Sri Lanka once again a democratic, open and free society. Other executive and administrative action resulted in an end to the culture of fear, the white vans largely ceased and very importantly the Police and the Judiciary were made independent and have been exercising their independence from the executive arm of government.
However, many of the civil society organisations especially which backed the Common Candidate have been somewhat critical of what is sometimes seen as either the slow pace of reforms or deviations from the promise of good governance. However, this Administrations landmark decision to set up a Commission to investigate its own actions in regard to the Central Bank bond issuance certainly demonstrates a willingness to be self-critical and accountable. The decision of the Prime Minister to testify was commendable and a submission to the rule of law.
Changing the discourse on reconciliation
Sri Lanka ended its civil war in 2009, as civil wars tend to do, socially divided and polarized along ethnic lines. The post-war rebuilding and reconciliation required a policy of inclusiveness and tolerance which the Rajapaksas demonstrated was beyond the scope of their politics. Far from becoming more tolerant and accommodative post-war, the tendency was to use the political capital of ending the war to jail the presidential election opponent, sack the chief justice and provide at best covert and at worse overt support to extremist organisations which was intent on calibrated communal violence against the Muslim community.
The Sirisena / Wickremesinghe Administration changed all that and with regard to reconciliation began a programme of releasing private lands occupied by the military during the war and a constitutional reform process, through the constitutional assembly. All this was possible through a change in the political discourse and dialogue which was ushered in by the politics and policies of the Sirisena / Wickremesinghe Administration.
Even the unique bipartisan national unity government which enjoys a two-thirds majority in Parliament are unique political processes brought about by both the President and the Prime Minister.
While the two parties they head, prepare to contest elections separately, an experience they went through in August 2015 as well, it is important to remember, the gains of the past three years should not be sacrificed by a return to the past.

## Title: Some Notes on Translation and on Madame Bovary

Some Notes on Translation and on Madame Bovary
Not long ago, I was chatting with an older friend who is a retired engineer and also something of a writer, but not of fiction. When he heard that I had just finished a translation of Madame Bovary, he said something like, But Madame Bovary has already been translated. Why does there need to be another translation or But Madame Bovary has been available in English for a long time, hasnt it Why would you want to translate it again Often, the idea that there can be a wide range of translations of one text doesnt occur to peopleor that a translation could be bad, very bad, and unfaithful to the original. Instead, a translation is a translationyou write the book again in English, on the basis of the French, a fairly standard procedure, and there it is, its been done and doesnt have to be done again.
A new book that is causing excitement internationally will be quickly translated into many languages, like the Jonathan Littell book that won the Prix Goncourt five years ago. It was soon translated into English, and if it isnt destined to endure as a piece of literature, it will probably never be translated into English again.
But in the case of a book that appeared more than one hundred and fifty years ago, like Madame Bovary, and that is an important landmark in the history of the novel, there is room for plenty of different English versions. For one thing, the first editions of the original text may have been faulty, and over the years one or more corrected editions have been published, so that the earliest English translations no longer match the most accurate original. (2) The earliest translators (as was the case with the Muirs rendering Kafka) may have felt they needed to inflict subtle or not so subtle alterations on the style and even the content of the original so as to make it more acceptable to the Anglophone audience; with the passing of time, we come to deem this something of a betrayal and ask for a more faithful version. (3) Earlier versions may simply not be as good in other respects as they could belet another translator have a try.
Each version will be quite distinct from all the others. How many ways, for instance, has even a single phrase (bouffes daffadissement) from Madame Bovary been translated:
gusts of revulsion
a kind of rancid staleness
stale gusts of dreariness
waves of nausea
fumes of nausea
flavorless, sickening gusts
stagnant dreariness
whiffs of sickliness
waves of nauseous disgust
Dante on translation
Nothing that is harmonized by the bond of the Muses can be changed from its own to another language without having all its sweetness destroyed.
Every generation needs a new translation
Wise people like to say, Every generation needs a new translation. It sounds good, but I believe it isnt necessarily so: If a translation is as fine as it can be, it may match the original in timelessness, tooit may deserve to endure. In fact, it may endure even if it is not all it should be in style and faithfulness.
The C. K. Scott Moncrieff translation of most of Prousts In Search of Lost Time (which he called, to Prousts distress, Remembrance of Things Past) was written in an Edwardian English more dated than Prousts own prose, and it departed consistently from the French original. Yet it had such conviction, on its own terms, and was so well written, if you liked a certain florid style, that it prevailed without competition for eighty years. (There was also, of course, the problem of finding a single individual to do a new translation of a three-thousand-page bookan individual who wouldnt die before finishing it, as Scott Moncrieff had.)
Even though a superlative translation can achieve timelessness, that doesnt mean other translators shouldnt attempt other versions. The more the better, in the end.
Another pessimist: Auden on translation
When, as in pure lyric, a poet sings rather than speaks, he is rarely, if ever, translatable.
A swarm of flies
For a while I thought there were fourteen previous translations of Madame Bovary. Then I discovered more and thought there were eighteen. Then another was published a few months before I finished mine. Now Ive heard that yet another will be coming out soon, so there will be at least twenty, maybe more that I dont know about.
It happened several times while I was doing the translation that I would open a newly discovered previous translation of Madame Bovary and my heart would sink. I would say to myself, Well, this is quite good! The work Im doing may be pointless, after all! Then I would look more closely and compare it to the original, and it would begin to seem less good. I would get to know it really well, and then it would seem quite inadequate.
For example, the following seems good enough, until I look at the original: Ahead of them, a swarm of flies drifted along, humming in the warm air. But they were flitting (voltigeait), not driftinga very different motionand they were buzzing (bourdonnant), as flies do, not humming. (Warm air is fine.)
Another example concerning insects occurs on the last page of the novel in a different translation: Cantharides beetles droned busily round the flowering lilies. Again, this seems fine until you check the French: des cantharides bourdonnaient autour des lis en fleur. Then you have to ask, why the gratuitous and rather clichd addition of busily, which personifies the beetlesespecially when Flaubert was at such pains to eliminate metaphor wherever possible
If a translation doesnt have obvious writing problems, it may seem quite all right at first glance, or even all the way through, if we dont look at the original. We readers, after all, quickly adapt to the style of a translator, stop noticing it, and get caught up in the authors story and vision of the world. And a great book is powerful enough to shine through a less than adequate translation. Unless we compare it to the original, we wont know what were missing.
