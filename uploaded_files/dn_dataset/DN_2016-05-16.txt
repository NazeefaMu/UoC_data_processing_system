Lanka loses golden opportunity to SLRFU blunder
Thanks to the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Unions (SLRFU) blunder Sri Lanka lost a golden opportunity of playing in the top league of the Asian Rugby Championship - Top 3 and with Malaysia winning the Division One title on Saturday they get the rare chance of rubbing shoulders with the elite Asian nations next year.
Sri Lanka by virtue of winning the Asian Rugby Championship  Division 1 last year could easily have taken part in the Top 3 of the championships this year but instead the SLRFU took a decision that the country should remain in Division I and by doing so they have let a rare opportunity go waste.
Next year again Sri Lanka will have to compete in Division I and try to emerge champions if they are to qualify and play in the Top 3.
Jason Dissanayaka on his way for that spectacular try that gave Sri Lanka the win over Philippines.
Malaysia created history by mauling Singapore 40-20 in the last round-robin match to lift the Division One title for the first time at the Asian Rugby Championship at Royal Selangor Stadium in Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia went into the match knowing that a win was all they needed to clinch the title after watching Sri Lanka score a last gasp win 25-21 win over Philippines on Saturday.
Malaysia and the Philippines started Saturdays matches tied on six points, with the hosts leading the four-team standings on better score difference.
Malaysia completed the three-match fixtures with 11 points while world No. 38 Sri Lanka finished second with nine points. The Philippines, who beat Malaysia 15-10 in the opening match, finished third with seven points while Singapore, who ended with just four points, will be relegated to Division Two next season.
Malaysia, cheered on by their home fans, put up a superb display against Singapore scoring five tries, three conversions and three penalties against Singapores two tries, two conversions and two penalties.
Mohamed Azmir Zanul Abidin scored two tries and was the toast of Malaysia while Fijians number eight Etonia Vaqa Saukuru, centre Jone Mawara Nasalo and full back Atunasia Lacadamu Takubu chipped in with one try each.
Mohammed Syarif Saiful Aazwan Sudin converted all the penalties and tries for Malaysia.
Expatriate fly half Mike Patterson made it a one-man show for Singapore by scoring tries, the conversions and penalties.
Malaysia had a disastrous start, with Singapore leading 6-0 from two penalties, but they slowly but surely turned on the heat to take control of the match.
The Division one champions (Malaysia) will be involved in a playoff with the team that finished third in Premier Division to compete in the top 3.Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea are the three countries competing in the Asian Rugby Championship  Top 3.
Malaysia really came up the ladder after finishing last in Seoul in 2011 and lost to Singapore in the Division Two final in 2013, hence all the credit should go to their rugby boards vision as they recruited 10 Fijian imports to play for them for this championship even though the eligibility of these 10 players to play in this tourney for Malaysia remains highly questionable and a mystery.
But hats off to the Malaysian rugby board for going ahead and playing them and in the end it paid rich dividends as the won the championship. After the win Malaysian head coach Lee Nyuk Fah was full of praise for the whole squad and the countrys rugby board. He added that he would request the Malaysian Rugby Union (MRU) to allow the national team to play in the play-off for a place in the Top 3 along with Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong.
In an earlier match Sri Lanka edged out a fighting Philippines in the very last minute of the game due to a spectacular try scored by open side flanker Jason Dissanayaka who single-handedly took the Tuskers to victory by scoring two tries.
What a game and what a result in the end as the Lankans were trailing 20-21 before the winning try came along. The Tuskers in this tournament was never even close to their usual brand of rugby and were very lucky to end as runner-up.
Sri Lanka scored three tries with Jason two and centre Kanchana Ramanayaka one while full back Reeza Mubarak converted two tries and put over two penalties.
At the last Asian rugby - Division 1 championship in Manila, Philippines in 2015, Sri Lanka became champions by playing a tremendous brand of rugby due to lots of top class overseas players from South Africa, Fiji, Western Samoa, Tonga, Kenya and New Zealand turning out for the local clubs in the domestic competition. One reason for Sri Lanka failing to win this time around was that we did not have a single overseas player turning out for the local clubs in the domestic inter-club championship due to the leading rugby clubs voting against foreign player participation for domestic matches. This has in a way affected the standard of our rugby and it reflects on the national teams performances.
Also after we won the Division-1 championship last year in 2015 we did not take part in the play offs with the top division third place team to win and graduate into the top division and play alongside the likes of Japan and South Korean sides due to the local rugby governing bodys decision. As a result of this blunder the chances of Sri Lanka getting into the top division by becoming winners of the division one tournament are drifting away unless a miracle happens.
Incidentally we are the only team that participated in the Asian rugby championship without a single overseas player whereas Malaysia had 10 Fijian imports, Singapore six and Philippines eight.
Hence its high time our rugby board (SLRFU) got things right by allowing foreign players to participate in our rugby clubs in the domestic tournament and get some quality foreign players to start representing our national team like we did in 2014 when two Fijian born players in Josep Dunn and Waqavulagi Emori represented the country.

Verstappen becomes youngest ever F1 winner in Spain
Barcelona, Sunday: Teenager Max Verstappen became Formula Ones youngest winner on Sunday when he took full advantage of a spectacular first lap crash that eliminated both Mercedes cars to claim a memorable triumph in the Spanish Grand Prix.
In his maiden outing with Red Bull following his unexpected promotion from Toro Rosso, the 18-year-old Dutchman showed supreme composure under pressure as he resisted all attacks to claim a stunning victory in only his 24th F1 race.
He became the youngest race winner, at 18 years and 228 days, replacing four-time champion Sebastian Vettel who had also taken that record as a Red Bull driver.
"It feels amazing, I can't believe it," said Verstappen.
"It was a great race and it felt like an endurance race. To win straight away, in my first race, its an amazing feeling. From a very young age, my dad has helped me a lot  its just amazing."
Verstappen, heralded as the sport's hottest property, proved he has everything required to be a future world champion, but owed some of his good fortune also to Red Bulls decision to put him on a three-stop strategy while his senior team-mate Daniel Ricciardo was on a two-stop plan.
That prevented the Australian from turning his early control of the race into victory after the opening lap collision between championship leader Nico Rosberg and his Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton had left them fuming in a gravel trap at Turn Four and out of the race. AFP

MR putting up an act for political expediency: Mangala
Responding to several recent statements made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera says that they again prove that the Rajapaksas efforts to portray him as a human rights defender and upholder of democracy while in the opposition, is merely an act done for the sake of political expediency.
In an open letter to the former President, Foreign Minister Samaraweera said: The many statements you have been making lately, especially the recent statement made by you opposing the Human Rights Council resolution, brings me genuine sorrow because it reminds once again that your role as a great human rights defender and upholder of democracy was merely an act done for the sake of political expediency while you were in the Opposition.
While identifying the UN resolution as a victory for Sri Lankans and the countrys foreign policy Samaraweera added: Your statement opposing the UN Human Rights Council Resolution exemplifies just how self-serving, unpatriotic and opportunistic politician you have become.
The minister added: When you were in the opposition, human rights, Geneva and the international community were your friends. But when power intoxicated you, they were forgotten and anyone who dared to talk of such universal values such as democracy, human rights and the rule of law were labeled as LTTE sympathisers and traitors. Now that you are out of power, looking at your coconut-breaker cronies business class travel to Geneva, it appears you have remembered them again.

Karunaratne warms up for Test with a ton
LEICESTER: Dimuth Karunaratne the Sri Lankan left-handed opener warmed up for the first Test against England on Thursday with a timely century in Sri Lankas three-day match against Leicestershire which ended in a draw at Grace Road on Sunday.
Karunaratne hit a pleasing century off 134 balls with 15 fours before retiring out.
His knock formed the basis of Sri Lankas second innings total of 200 for four wickets when the match was called off in mutual consent between the two captains.
Karunaratne and his opening partner Kaushal Silva shared an opening stand of exactly 100 when Sri Lanka commenced their second innings after Leicestershire had declared at 375-5.
Silva followed his first innings knock of 38 with solid 43 and the Lankan would also have been pleased with the form of Lahiru Thirimanne who was unbeaten on 40 out of a second wicket stand of 79 with Karunaratne.
In the first innings uncapped Dasun Shanaka hit the tourists first century of the tour with an exciting 112 off 132 balls.
This is Sri Lankas final warm-up game before they take on England in a series of three Tests.

Birthday boy Murray masters Djokovic in Rome
Rome, Sunday: Britain's Andy Murray celebrated his 29th birthday in style Sunday by winning his maiden Rome Masters title with a hard-fought win over disgruntled world number one Novak Djokovic.
Murray, the number two seed who suffered defeat to Djokovic in last week's Masters final in Madrid, prevailed 6-3, 6-3 in one hour, 35 minutes.
From a total of 32 previous meetings it is only Murray's 10th win over tennis's man of the moment.
"Well done Andy, you did a great job today. You were just too good," Djokovic said on court after the final.
It is only Murray's third clay-court title, after his maiden victories on the red dirt in Munich and Madrid last year, but comes in timely fashion just two weeks before the start of the French Open at Roland Garros.
Murray, who cruised into the final with an easy semi-final win over French lucky loser Lucas Pouille early on Saturday, came into the match fresher after Djokovic was forced into a three-hour epic by Japan's Kei Nishikori later on Saturday.
It was the third three-set match he had played leading up to the final, and amid the challenging circumstances of intermittent rain, it did not take long for nerves to fray.
Murray piled the pressure on from the start, earning a trio of break chances in Djokovic's first service game.
Djokovic saved them all, but two games later Murray grabbed the first break of the match when he forced Djokovic into a backhand error for 3-1.
The slippery conditions were not to Djokovic's liking and Murray, who had no complaints about the weather, tried to capitalise.
He won 16 of his first 19 service points, taking a 5-2 lead with an ace down the T, and then wrapped up the opener with a sublime forehand drop-shot winner to wrap up the set in 46 minutes.
Djokovic's game, and nerves began to come apart in a second set that saw umbrellas come out and hoods pulled up due to the occasional spattering of rain.
Leading 2-1, Djokovic complained to the referee about the lack of a rain stoppage and minutes later, still battling to win the fourth game, he began remonstrating with himself.
The Serbian skimmed his racket off the ground in another angry gesture after Murray got the first break of the set in game five.
From then on, Djokovic's game fell apart as Murray built on his noticeably superior serve, adding variety with drops shots and volleys at the net.
Murray broke in the seventh game of the second set for a 4-3 lead, prompting Djokovic -- from his chair -- to start demanding a halt to the game due to rain.
He was heard saying he "don't want to play any more", adding: "My friend, it's been raining for an hour." Djokovic underlined the threat of injuries playing in such conditions, but his pleas went unheard. AFP

Sri Lanka Navy denies reports it's building facility on Katchatheevu
The Sri Lanka Navy (SLN) on Sunday dismissed reports that it planned to build a naval facility on the Katchatheevu islet, which was ceded by India to Sri Lanka during the June 1974 bilateral agreement.

Talking to The Hindu, SLN Commander Vice-Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne termed baseless the reports that the Navy had planned to install a detachment on the islet. Our role in the proposed construction of a new shrine at St. Anthonys church has been blown out of proportion, the Commander added.

After Vikas Swarups observations

The Commanders attention was drawn to observations of the official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs in the Indian government, Vikas Swarup, a few days ago that the Indian High Commission had been asked to provide more details on the reports and the move to build a shrine without informing India.

Recounting how the Navy got involved in the construction of the shrine for which the foundation stone was laid a week ago, the Vice Admiral Wijegunaratne explained that when the annual two-day Katchatheevu festival took place in February this year, the help of the Navy was sought by both the Diocese of Jaffna and visiting Indian pilgrims, mostly fishermen, for putting up a new shrine as the existing one was too small to accommodate the pilgrims and it was very old.

According to Bishop of Jaffna, Rt. Rev. Justin Bernard Gnanapragasam, under whose jurisdiction comes the Katchatheevu shrine, the size should be 10 X 8 ft.

Bishop rebuts contention

The Bishop, who attended the festival for the last four years, denied the contention that the original decision was to build the new shrine jointly by the Jaffna diocese and the fishermen from Tamil Nadu and Verkodu parish. They have no say in such matters. Besides, only the Navy can carry out transportation of material. This was why we sought their help.

The Navy would also arrange for labour and the Sri Lankan government might sound some private companies in Colombo to provide financial support for the shrine construction.

Rt. Rev. Gnanapragasam asserted that the pilgrims from Tamil Nadu, who approached him and renewed their request for the new shrine this year too, had expressed their desire to make contributions for the construction.

Archaeological monument

Pointing out that the existing shrine was built in 1901, the Commander described it as an archaeological monument, which the Navy cannot disturb. As in India, any structure that had been in existence for not less than 100 years would come under laws on archaeology.

Besides, the steel bar, used to put up a structure during the visit of Pope Francis in January last year, would be utilised on Katchatheevu. The Vice-Admiral said when Pope Francis was in Sri Lanka, Joseph Vaz, a 17 century priest who belonged to Goa and engaged himself in evangelism in Sri Lanka, was cannonised. This is why we have felt that if we put to use what was blessed by the Holy Father, this would promote ties between peoples of Sri Lanka and India, the Commander added. (The Hindu)

Sri Lanka's Dhammika Prasad ruled out of first Test against England

Dhammika Prasad injured his shoulder during Sri Lanka's first tour match against Essex last week

Sri Lanka paceman Dhammika Prasad will miss the chance to repeat his Headingley heroics of two years ago after being ruled out of the first Test against England starting on Thursday. Prasad played a key role in Sri Lanka's first Test series win in England when, in the second and final match of the 2014 campaign, he took five for 50 in the second innings at Headingley, the headquarters of county champions Yorkshire in Leeds, northern England.
His haul included all of England's top four, in a match Sri Lanka won by 100 runs after clinching victory with just one ball to spare on the final day. However, this trip saw the 32-year-old injure his shoulder during Sri Lanka's first tour match against Essex last week.
"We're hoping that we can get him bowling again pretty soon," Sri Lanka coach Graham Ford told BBC Sport after the tourists' final warm-up match, against Leicestershire ended in a draw on Sunday. "Prasad has had a few tests and the specialist came to see him today," the South African added. "We'll have to build him up and get him bowling a number of overs in the nets to have him prepared potentially for the second or third Test.
" Sri Lanka's top-order have struggled in England so far this tour but Dimuth Karunaratne made a hundred and Lahiru Thirimanne hit 40 at Grace Road. "As we have gone along players have started to find their feet and find a bit of form," Ford said. "Everyday, there is someone new who is starting to look like he's feeling a bit more settled in English conditions. "Hopefully with a bit more work the boys will have some good belief about what they can do. It is going to be about mental toughness and handling pressure when the Test starts on Thursday."

Mervyn Silva sets up 'Joint Opposition'
The controversial former Minister Mervyn Silva yesterday announced that he was starting a political group called the Joint Opposition with himself as its leader.
Addressing the media in Colombo, Silva said that his will be the bona-fide joint opposition unlike the group in Parliament with the same name, which he described as something unnecessary like the appendix in the body.
The so-called joint opposition in Parliament is like the appendix in our body. Surgical removal of the appendix causes no health issues, he added.
Silva also displayed a banner bearing the name Joint Opposition and a symbol and claimed that he had wide support both in political circles and from the public. Silva said he will show his groups strength in the days to come.
Silva said he does not intend to defame the senior politicians in the so-called Joint Opposition supporting former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and added that however, he firmly believed that the group was not doing anything progressive.
He was of the opinion that the group identifying themselves as the Joint Opposition cannot use the term as they were UPFA Parliamentarians.
Silva also claimed that he had extensive knowledge about the Rajapaksas and added that there was no one in the so-called joint opposition to match his mastery in that respect.
Meanwhile, Silva said former President Rajapaksa instructed him to visit the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation in 2008, where a brawl occurred.
Silva with his supporters stormed into the news room and attacked the news director of the Rupavahini Corporation. The attack backfired when the employees manhandled him and held him hostage. The incident drew widespread condemnation.
