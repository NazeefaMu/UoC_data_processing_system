50 Greatest Players in World Cup History
#33 Lilian Thuram
We remember the 1998 World Cup as Zinedine Zidanes World Cup... but apart from those two booming headers in the final (which is not a small contribution by any means), he hadnt really had the best of tournaments... sent off for an act of unadulterated violence against Saudi Arabia in the group stages, he would return and do not much till those two corners were swung in against Brazil.
The real stars of the show, then, was the French defence. With marauding Basque Bixente Lizarazu on the left, that Rolls-Royce of a ballplayer Laurent Blanc partnering the Minotaur, Marcel Desailly, in the middle and ever reliable Lilian Thuram on the right, they were impregnable. Hell, they conceded just twice the whole tournament, and one of those goals was a Michael Laudrup penalty.
That second goal, though, was due to a rare mistake on the part of Thuram - for once not in-sync with his partners, he played Davor Suker onside for the Croat to tuck one under Fabian Barthez.
So what does he do to make up for it
A minute later, he bombs forward, dispossesses the Croat skipper, Zvonimir Boban, plays a one-two with Youri Djorkaeff (whos as surprised as everyone else to see whos playing give and go with) and thrashes it into the far low corner. His first goal ever for France. And it came in a World Cup semifinal.
Twenty minutes later, he would bulldoze Jarni and curl another peach into the same corner of Drazen Ladics goal.
Those were the only two goals he ever scored for Les Blues.
What a boss.
Fast forward eight years and Thuram - recently retired from international duty - has been called out of retirement by Raymond Domenech (desperate to atone for Les Blues horrifying performances in the 2002 World Cup and the 2004 Euros) and hes partnering William Gallas in the heart of that once-again formidable French defence. He plays like its 1998 all over again, marshalling everyone around him with incredible ease - France concede just 3 goals during the entirety of the tournament.
He was brilliant in 1998, and maybe even better in 2006... displaying a level of consistency that most of us only dream of achieving in our professional lives. He was the same for Monaco, Parma, Juventus, and Barcelona - any team that had him didnt have to think twice about the position he was supposed to play in. He was never out of form, never injured, never made a mistake... on the rare occassion he did, he would make up for it himself, as Croatia found out so painfully in 98.
We dont really value consistency enough - as a species we are attuned to the spectacular... and you might think Lillian Thuram is on this list just because of those two magnificent, tournament-saving, goals in the 98 semis... but hes here, above some much more celebrated individuals because we at SK wanted to pay tribute to the absolute, blind, trust Ruddy Lilian Thuram-Ulie inspired in everyone who saw him play football.
We pay homage to the man who rose above racial discrimination and hasnt forgotten to go back and fight that social malaise off the field, to the man who valued consistency above all else.
Merci, Lilian... and take your well-deserved place amongst our list of 50 Greatest World Cup Players. - sk

50 Greatest Players in World Cup History
#34 Eusbio
When one utters the word Portugal in a footballing context, the first name that comes to most millennial minds is, perhaps, Cristiano Ronaldo. Ask someone older than 30 or 40, though, and theyll name a certain African-born legend who changed the entire complexion of Portuguese football starting from the mid-1900s. Eusebio. Learn the name, recognise the greatness.
Widely recognised as one of the finest players to have ever played the game, Eusebio, also fondly known as the Black Panther or o Rei (the King), was discovered in Mozambique as a teenager before subsequently immigrating to Portugal with the help of Benficas then coach Bela Guttmann. In hindsight, his immigration was probably the best thing that could have happened to Benfica and Portugal.
Eventually, in a career that spanned over two decades and saw him play for 9 different clubs (with 15 years of it being with Benfica), Eusebio racked up a combined, jaw-dropping tally of 423 goals in 431 games (317 of which came in just 301 matches at Benfica, helping them win 11 League titles during his time there)
An exquisitely prolific striker, there wasnt much Eusebio couldnt do on a football pitch. He was quick, agile, strong and possessed a belter of a right foot. He also had a decent left foot and could even use his head when situations demanded it.
Of course, there was no stopping him on the international stage either. Representing the Portuguese National Team for over 12 long years, Eusebio scored 41 goals in 64 games and was the countrys leading goalscorer until Pauleta overtook him in 2005.
For all his heroics, Eusebio was, unfortunately, a part of only one major tournament for Portugal - the 1966 World Cup, and boy did he make it his own. Slotted in a group alongside Brazil, Bulgaria and Hungary, Portugals Black Panther led them to their best ever finish in a World Cup as they finished 3rd behind England and West Germany.
42 years on, that campaign still stands as Portugals best ever performance in a World Cup and that should tell you enough about just how significant an accomplishment that was.
Not impressed yet Wait, theres more.
The Brazil side that they were pitted alongside in the group stage were undergoing their famous renaissance period and were entering the 1966 World Cup as two-time defending champions, having lifted the trophy in 1958 and 1962. Hungary were no pushovers either and had finished as quarter-finalists in the 1962 World Cup.
Now, considering that Portugal had qualified for their first ever World Cup, few expected them to upset the likes of Brazil and Hungary. However, what followed will forever be narrated as a fairytale in Portuguese households.
In their first group game against Hungary, Portugal emerged victorious after a 3-1 result stunned the Hungarians. In their second game, Portugal dismantled Bulgaria 3-0 with Eusebio scoring his first goal of the competition.
Their third and final group stage game was against Brazil, who needed nothing short of a win to qualify. Imagine stepping up to face the two-time defending champions while they were desperate for a win.
Ironically, Portugals greatest group stage victory came in a time of adversity against their toughest opponents yet, as they silenced the Seleo 3-1 on the back of a crucial brace from Eusebio.
Proceeding to the knockout stage, Portugal came up against an intimidating North Korea side in the quarter-finals of the tournament. Make no mistake, they were intimidating. The Koreans had eliminated two-time winners Italy in the group stages.
25 minutes into the game, North Korea were up 3-0 as Portugal seemed set to be tossed out of the World Cup in unceremonious fashion.
Told you. The Koreans were certainly intimidating.
And then stepped up Eusebio. Portugals hero, their protector, their saviour. Despite the game looking like it was all but sealed, o Rei seemed to have different ideas.
The Portuguese striker knew he needed to throw in the kitchen sink and he went on to throw in the whole damn kitchen.
Scoring 4 consecutive goals - two of which came before half-time while the other two came after - Eusebio engineered one of the most glorious comebacks in the history of football, and what a time to do it. By the time he was done, Portugal had recovered from a 3-0 deficit and had the game by the neck before eventually winning it 5-3.
With 7 goals in his first 4 World Cup games, Eusebio led Portugal into the semi-finals against England where their campaign was eventually halted as England got the better of them with a 2-1 scoreline. Again, it was Eusebio who scored the solitary goal for Portugal.
Drowned in disappointment after a glorious run, Portugal took on the side from the Soviet Union in the 3rd-place match and yet again, it was Eusebio who first found the net, allowing Portugal to win the game 2-1, finishing 3rd in the 1966 World Cup - Which, till date, still happens to be their most successful World Cup campaign.
Portugal may not have won the trophy in 1966, but they had won respect and recognition while also putting themselves on the footballing map. Eusebio finished the tournament as the leading goalscorer with 9 goals, subsequently becoming the first player ever to win the Golden Boot. In not just the World Cup but in the only major tournament he ever played.
Since then, Portugal has seen some sensational players represent them, with the likes of Luis Figo, Pauleta, Deco, Pepe and Cristiano Ronaldo rising to prominence. However, not one of these modern greats has managed to surpass Eusebios significance for the national side, and that speaks volumes about the kind of legendary footballer Eusebio was.
True class, indeed, and hes rightfully in Sportskeedas list of 50 Greatest World Cup Players.

Aloysiuss revision petition fixed for further argument for June 1
A revision application filed by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena seeking an Interim Order to release them on bail was yesterday fixed for further argument on June 1 by the Court of Appeal.
Senior Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda PC appearing for the Attorney General informed Court that there is no illegality in the order made by the Colombo Fort Magistrate regarding their bail.
Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana had informed Court that the prosecutors have followed an illegal procedure by presenting the Presidential Commission into Central Bank Bond issue before Magistrate in order to mislead the Magistrates. He argued that bail has been refused after perusing the recommendations made by the Presidential Commission without having a proper magisterial inquiry into the issue.
In reply to the submissions made by petitioners counsel Marapana, SASG Kodagoda informed court that the had filed a B report coupled with statements of evidence following a comprehensive investigation.
When the matter came up before Court of Appeal (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne, the matter was fixed for further argument on June 1.
The suspects were remanded in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issuance.
Arjun Aloysius states that by his application he was seeking Courts Jurisdiction to the set aside order dated March 9, 2018 of the Colombo High Court in Revision Application No. HCRA 22/2018.
The High Court refused notice in the said Revision Application for affirming order dated 16-02-2018 made by the Fort Magistrates Court in proceedings bearing No.B/8266/18, refusing them bail and committing the petitioner to remand custody.
Aloysius states that he was arrested and produced before the Fort Magistrates Court on February 4, 2018 and committed to remand custody by the Fort Magistrates Court on February 4 and February 16 and thereafter, at the behest of and on the strength of further reports filed by the Criminal Investigation Department, in connection with an investigation commenced upon a complaint dated 25-11-2016, made by the Central Bank Governor.
Filing this petition through Counsel Sanath Wijewardena, Arjun Aloysius said he was arrested at his residence at 7.30 am on February 4 by Criminal Investigation Department officers, acting under the supervision of the Attorney General.
The Petitioner had not, up to his time of arrest, been notified or summoned by the Criminal Investigation Department, for the recording of a statement from him in connection with the said purported investigation or complaint made by the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
On February 4, 2018, upon the Counsel appearing for the Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena moving that the matter be called on the morning of 05-02-2018, for making their legal submissions on behalf of the suspects with regard to their release on bail, the Magistrate made order that the matter be called before the said Court on 05-02-2018 and committed the petitioner and the other suspect to remand custody, Aloysius said.
The Magistrate made order that the written submissions of the petitioner and the fourth suspect Palisena be filed on 07-02-2018 and proceeded to make order committing them to remand custody, without making any order as to the grant or refusal of bail.
Aloysius states that accordingly, aggrieved by the said order dated 16-02-2018 of the Fort Magistrate, he preferred a Revision Application against same to the High Court of the Provinces of the Western Province Holden in Colombo [HCRA 22/2018] wherein he invoked the Revisionary jurisdiction of the said Court on the grounds.
Aloysius states that on 09-03-2018, the Judge of the High Court of the Provinces of the Western Province in Colombo, delivered his Order refusing the issuance of Notice in the said Revision Application to the Respondents. In this application, the petitioner had cited the OIC of CID (Unit 3), the Director of CID and the Attorney General as respondents.
The suspects have been charged under Public Property Act, Penal Code, Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and Code of Conduct for Primary Dealers for illegal insider trading.
Gamini Marapana PC with Kalinga Indatissa PC appeared for the petitioners. Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda with Senior State Counsel Udara Karunaratne appeared for the Attorney General.

Army troops rescue pregnant woman on time
A pregnant woman, stranded due to ravaging floods in the general area of Thoduwawa, Marawila, received the timely intervention of Army troops of 16 Gajaba Regiment (GR) of the 143 Brigade under the 14 Division on Tuesday (22) evening, while the troops were conducting emergency rescue and relief operations elsewhere in close proximity to that area.
Troops were informed by another flood victim that a lonely house, situated away from theirs has had a pregnant woman before the floods inundated the area, but villagers are unaware as to what has happened to her after the floods.
Alert to the information, troops using a truck waded across the water and approached the house in question and searched for the pregnant woman whom they referred. With difficulty, troops found the house where the pregnant woman was living and requested her to join them to be taken to a safer place.
Accordingly, troops evacuated her from her flood-affected house and took her to the nearby Marawila hospital in an Army truck. On the advice of medical authorities, she was asked to get admitted to the hospital before delivery.

Australias Smith looks set for Global T20 Canada event
Los Angeles, Friday: Disgraced former Australia cricket captain Steve Smith appears poised to return to the game after being named Thursday among the marquee players for the inaugural Global T20 Canada event.
Smith, the worlds number one Test batsman, was sacked and sent home in disgrace after the third Test against South Africa in March.
He later accepted a 12-month ban from all international and domestic games by Cricket Australia for his role in the ball-tampering scandal that rocked the sport.
Cricket Australia told AFP Smith had the support of the governing body to play in the Canadian event.
He had been on a $1.9 million contract with Indian Premier League side Rajasthan Royals but stepped down amid the scandal.
David Warner, who was the vice-captain, was also banned for 12 months and Cameron Bancroft was suspended for nine months.
Warner is set to make a return to the field in September with Sydneys Randwick Petersham. Bancroft was last week cleared to play club cricket in Western Australia.
The Canadian tournament will be held at Maple Leaf Cricket Club near Toronto from June 28-July 15 and feature six teams representing Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Edmonton and Winnipeg along with a Caribbean side.
Teams are to be selected on May 30 via a player draw. Chris Gayle, Shahid Afridi, Dwayne Bravo, Lasith Malinga, Chris Lynn, Darren Sammy, David Miller, Sunil Narine and Andre Russell were also named as marquee players. AFP

Former Thomian and CR&FC captain and Lankan ruggerites shocking disclosure
Current Singer schools rugby tournament is illegal alleges legend Jordashe
Former S. Thomas College and CR&FC rugby captain and Sri Lanka player Christo Jordashe is of the view that the current schools league tournament is allegedly null and void as it has not been approved by SLRFU or no request has been made to conduct these tournaments from the main body of the Union unless the council has approved it.
Therefore the referees are also blowing in an allegedly unauthorized schools rugby tournament and this has partly contributed to many current issues as there is no proper co-ordination or co-operation between these entities up to now, Jordashe told the Daily News.
Also the schools authority has stated in their tournament rules that under 14 and under 16 boys can play in the major school league rugby. I believe this is also wrong as the world rugby body does not allow this. It is clearly stated in the IRB regulations under age boys cannot take part in major school league tournaments, he pointed out.
However I personally see the need for children of 15 and 16 years being given special approval by their parents and schools to play 1stXV as we find many children playing major school league at this young age in Sri Lanka. I must say that the Sri Lankan rugby fraternity needs answers for this breakdown and strict action should be taken against troublemakers who bring shame upon their schools and cause distress to the players, officials, fans and referees. At the same time referees who are repeatedly making mistakes should not be given any A division or even B division school games until they have reached a consistent, confident level of refeering without being biased or ignorant on the correct rules.
We have witnessed substandard refereeing causing unrest amongst fans, disgruntled old boys who continue to abuse referees and shameful thuggery witnessed with no crowd control measures. No one has the right to make verbal threats or abuse a referee although we witness it even in club games, where officials misbehave in an unbecoming manner and aggravate the crowd situation and do not set examples.
Jordashe said that the current crisis prevailing in the schools rugby tournament is mainly due to wrong policy decisions in the management system and structure, which has to be rectified with stringent measures and procedures.
The Schools section has not been able to resolve issues on their own or even with the Education Ministry who apparently has prevented the Rugby Union from having any affiliation with the Schools Section or to be brought under their wing, although they are legally bound to do so by world rugby regulations, said Jordashe, who was also the Sri Lanka national sevens team manager, S.Thomas College rugby under 18 head coach, Sri Lanka Rugby council member and former CR & FC president.
The Referees Association too has become a separate entity for the past few years although they should be affiliated to the Sri Lanka Rugby. This I believe was a directive given by a former Sports Minister to dissolve an interim SLRS committee headed by Chula Dharmadasa who was doing a great job in building up referees on merit under Garett Williamson in 2014/15, Jordashe further stated.
Jordashe went on to say that at present we have a few good referees but a lot more indepth training has to be done to bring them to a higher consistent standard.
The present Sports Minister a lawyer by profession will understand the legalities, challenges on the shortcomings to be faced without undue political interference from various quarters.
I am confident he will do everything in his capacity to put the system right with strict disciplinary conditions applied and ensure proper protocol for the game to continue without further disruption, which has already lost its momentum, Jordashe said.
The schools section I believe continue to run this Singer schools tournament without following the required approval and protocol from the governing body. They need to compromise on their differences and work with the Sri Lanka Rugby. In the prevailing crisis a situation like the present one, many aspects of regulatory matters are revealed to the rugby fraternity but it is sad that damage has already been done and we face a shameful situation in the world rugby arena, where we boast of majority school rugby players and teams, Jordashe pointed out.
Without bickering and blaming each institution, it is time that all stakeholders put their heads together and moved in the correct direction in our schools league tournament or our National rugby could also be affected if these shortcomings cannot be rectified.
Since these young players are the future of our National rugby, I hope once and for all the Sports Minister and Sri Lanka Rugby will make the correct policy decisions on the schools section tournament for the betterment of the game and to avoid the present situation occurring again as it sadly has become a trend, he said.
Let us hope the Minister along with Sri Lanka rugby, schools section and Education Ministry, Referees Society and knowledgeable legal representatives resolve this issue under the umbrella of IRB regulations where our Rugby Union is governed by and answerable. Lets hope the game of Rugby will be the ultimate winner, he concluded.

Flood mitigation
Another year, another flood. The latest reports indicate that more than 125,000 persons have been affected by the floods, with 13 deaths. Twelve districts have been severely affected while some other districts in their periphery have been affected to a lesser extent. With more rains projected over the next few days, the situation may get worse before it gets better.
But the overall situation up to now is much better compared to the last few years, when there was much more damage to lives and property. The Colombo City was a perfect example, having experienced only a few instances of minor flooding this year so far. The Road Development Authority (RDA) has also confirmed that the damage to roads islandwide is much less than initially feared. This is indeed good news, because it means that some of the flood mitigation plans and laws implemented since last years deluge may indeed be working. The insights gained from this years floods should similarly be used to augment flood prevention plans and projects.
Sri Lanka has a rich network of rivers, tanks and waterways that form the cornerstone of its agricultural economy. But in a period of incessant rain, this becomes a disadvantage as they spill over very easily. The fact that many regions of Sri Lanka are low lying aggravates the problem. With residences, commercial buildings and roads lying almost next to major reservoirs and rivers, even a few inches of non-stop rain can wreak havoc.
The other factor that contributes to floods is land reclamation, both legal and illegal. Many water retention areas such as swamps have been reclaimed and built upon, which leaves rainwater nowhere else to go. Earlier, excess rainwater was retained in these areas, which prevented the inundation of residential areas and roads. The Government must clamp down hard on any illegal reclamation projects already underway. Where reclamation is essential for a legally sanctioned development project, all environmental guidelines should be followed to ensure flood mitigation as well.
It is also essential to clear drainage holes, drains and culverts periodically  even in times of drought. Polythene, garbage and leaves trapped in drains and culverts can prevent the smooth flow of rainwater and lead to flash floods. In fact, Colombo Mayor Rosy Senanayake instructed CMC officials to clear up all drainage holes during a recent inspection tour of some areas in Colombo. Other mayors and heads of Local Bodies should take a cue from her in this regard. On the other hand, the public should also reduce the use of polythene and give up the habit of throwing away plastic materials and food waste indiscriminately. As a bonus, keeping the environment clean helps prevent diseases such as dengue.
Attention must also be paid to rescue and relief efforts during floods. One common complaint of flood-affected residents heard on TV was the lack of rescue boats. Right now, boats are supplied by the Navy and some fisheries societies as and when floods occur. Some interior areas of the country do not have Navy camps, which means the boats have to be ferried over considerable distances. It has been suggested that mechanical and non-mechanical boats could be permanently stored at higher-ground facilities in flood-prone areas for swift use in a flood scenario. This is a suggestion worthy of implementation without delay.
Moreover, the proposed Air Ambulance service could prove to a life saver in floods by augmenting the helicopter fleet of the Sri Lanka Air Force, which is now stretched to the limit in trying to save people marooned in locations that cannot be reached by boats or 4WD vehicles. The Sri Lanka Coast Guard must also be better equipped to rescue fishermen facing distress in windy and rainy conditions. Likewise, more earthmoving and construction machinery must be stationed in all landslide- prone areas to quickly remove debris from earthslips and repair the affected roads.
One redeeming feature of the current floods is the very close coordination among the Disaster Management Centre (DMC), Meteorology Department, National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) and the Irrigation Department, which all have to play a vital role in disaster prediction and prevention along with the relevant line and provincial ministries. Their top representatives must be commended for coming before the TV cameras every day to keep the public informed about the latest developments. There is also a short code hotline for complaints with regard to shortcomings in rescue and relief activities, which is another commendable idea. They must also work closely with the five mobile networks to disseminate urgent flood/landslide warnings via SMS to their subscribers  such a system is already in place for tsunamis and can easily be extended to other disasters.
The authorities must go ahead with plans to upgrade all these agencies, especially the Met Department without delay. While its predictions have become more accurate over the years, there is still room for improvement. The upgrade will be worth every cent spent on it, in terms of lives saved. We cannot control the weather yet, but we can certainly be prepared for its serious consequences with prior knowledge.

Govt to bear farmers premium this year
The Agriculture Ministry will provide paddy farmers with the agriculture insurance premium free for the first time this year.
The government had allocated Rs.5228 million for the agriculture insurance this year.
Farmers who cultivate paddy, chilli, maize, potatoes and onions will also be eligible for the insurance.
The initiative for this programme was proposed by Agriculture minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
Paddy farmers had to spend Rs.1375 as the annual membership fee for the insurance programme. However, the government had decided to bear the fee on behalf of the farmers this year.
The ceremony to present the insurance cover before the yala season will be held on Monday at the Nonagama cultural centre in Hambantota with the participation of Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera and State Minister Wasantha Aluwihare.

Highlander Nabura cops six-week ban for face kick
Wellington, Friday: Otago Highlanders wing Tevita Nabura received a six-week suspension Friday for his mid-air karate kick to the face of NSW Waratahs Cam Clark.
The kick, which came in the 18th minute of last Saturdays game earned Nabura a red card, with his departure proving pivotal as the Waratahs went on to end Australian teams 40-match losing streak against New Zealand opposition.
The South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina Rugby (SANZAAR) judiciary committee said Nabura pleaded guilty to physically abusing a player by kicking.
The players action was seen by the committee as a misguided effort by an inexperienced player to both try and regain balance whilst in the air and ward off the approaching opposing player, it said.
The committee said it initially considered a 12-week ban but halved it due to the players excellent record, his remorse, his inexperience and his guilty plea.
The ban means Nabura is out until Friday, July 6, although he will only miss four Super Rugby matches, against the Queensland Reds, Wellington Hurricanes, Waikato Chiefs and Canterbury Crusaders. He will be eligible to play for the Highlanders in the finals if they make the top eight. AFP

Indonesia passes tougher terror law
INDONESIA: Indonesia passed a new law on Friday that will give police more power to take pre-emptive action against terror suspects in the wake of the country's deadliest Islamist attacks in years.
The bill had been stalled for almost two years as parliament wrangled over details, including how to define terrorism, but a wave of deadly suicide bombings this month hiked pressure on lawmakers to pass the legislation.
Police will now be allowed to detain terror suspects for as long as 21 days, up from the current one week, and they will now also be able to charge people for joining or recruiting for a terrorist organisation, at home or abroad.
Rights activists have expressed concerns that the bill's vague wording could open the door to a crackdown on any group seen as a threat.
This month, 13 people were killed in separate suicide attacks on churches and a police station by two families -- including a nine and 12-year-old girl -- in Indonesia's second-biggest city Surabaya. The families had ties to a local extremist network that had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, which claimed the attacks.
A police officer was also killed in subsequent attack on a police station in Sumatra days later.
Indonesia -- which is set to host the Asian Games in three months and an IMF-World Bank meeting in Bali in October -- has long struggled with Islamist militancy. Its worst-ever attack was the 2002 Bali bombings that killed more than 200 people, including locals and foreign tourists. Security forces have arrested hundreds of militants during a sustained crackdown since the Bali bombing and most attacks in recent years have been limited to low-level operations against domestic security forces.
But police have said they needed beefed-up terror laws to crack down on homegrown militancy.
In the wake of the Surabaya attacks, President Joko Widodo threatened to issue an emergency regulation if the parliament failed to pass the new law. - AFP

International training for local farmers through KOPIA
For the third consecutive year, the Korea Program on International Agriculture (KOPIA) Sri Lanka Centre organized a training and exposure visit to South Korea for 10 selected farmers from the Galenbindunuwewa, Bulnewa and Hambantota model-villages, together with two officers from the Department of Agriculture (DOA).
The "International Farmer Group Leaders Training hosted by the Rural Development Administration (RDA) of Korea took place from May 13 to 19, in the city of Jeonju-si.
It provided a platform for members of the farming community from Sri Lanka and Paraguay to share and enhance their knowledge and experience in international agricultural practices adopted in onion farming.
Since opening its resident office in Sri Lanka in 2011, KOPIA has worked together with the Ministry of Agriculture of Sri Lanka and the DOA to introduce modern Korean agriculture technology and know-how to Sri Lanka, and to improve the quality and productivity of the local agro sector.
KOPIA employs special survey methods and selection tools to identify key areas that require development in the local agriculture field and based on these findings, utilizes tailor-made methods to improve each sector.
KOPIA continues to provide assistance to local farmers in multiple forms including but not limited to, the transfer of advanced technology, provision of materials and equipment, assigning Korean experts for selected agriculture sectors, organizing field trainings and workshops in Sri Lanka as well as hosting international training and exposure visits for the benefit of local farmers and DOA officers.
Through these efforts, KOPIA aims to help Sri Lanka achieve self-sufficiency in the field of agriculture.

England and Australia ruled cricket for 100 years
Its fine that India has taken over: Dean Jones
Former Australia batsman Dean Jones praised the the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias work over the past decade in spite of the clamour surrounding its vice-like grip over the sport. The Indian Premier League, which has attracted its fair share of detractors, also earned a glowing tribute from the cricketer-turned-analyst.
The BCCIs recent decision to not play a day-night Test in Australia later this year has drawn a lot of criticism, but Jones looked at the bright side of the power shift from the traditional powerhouses of the sport to India.
The games pretty good at the moment, Jones was quoted as saying by DNA. England and Australia have had their go for 100 years. Indias taken over and have got a strong hold in ICC and thats fine.
The 57-year-old also threw his weight behind the multi-million-dollar contracts that modern-day players take home from the IPL. Players [are] getting paid more money, people watching TV, IPL is just absolutely killer. So where is the bad part of this
He added, The ICC has got to run the game, but I sit back and say, well, if it wasnt for what Indias done in the last 10 years, I wonder where we would be Wonder where the players would be because they wouldnt be getting the same money [anywhere] and the worlds 80% cricket turnover comes from this great country. See, its all very well too.
Jones thinks the game has been outstanding over the last 10 years but for a couple of teething problems. If it wasnt for Indian cricket the players wouldnt earn the money they are earning now, he said.
Following the IPL, India travel to England where they will play three One-day Internationals, as many Twenty20 Internationals and five Tests across a gruelling three-month tour. For India to come good, Jones opined that their batting order has to exorcise their ghosts from the 2014 tour.
The Indian team is very good. They have got a bowling attack that can bowl in any conditions. Its up to the batsmen if they can get through. It wasnt just the swinging ball, but it was Moeen Ali who was knocking you guys out [during the last tour], an off spinner! So it was like, what the hell was going on there That needs to be picked up a little bit. So, I am expecting India to beat England.

Recent high profile arrests:
Landmark in Sri Lanka's work on anti-corruption
In remarks to the United Nations this week, a Sri Lankan anti-corruption official said the recent arrests of two senior government officials was an example of a new prosecutorial independence in Sri Lanka, Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption Sarath Jayamanne said.
This not only demonstrated the independence of our body, but also the policy of non-interference, he said. Jayamanne was speaking at the U.N. General Assembly in New York on Wednesday.
These arrests marked a landmark in our work on anti-corruption, as this was the highest ranking official to have been arrested, while in office in 60 years, he said.
Earlier this month, detectives arrested the Presidents Chief of Staff I.H.K. Mahanama, and State Timber Corporation Chairman Piyadasa Dissanayake, on the charge of soliciting a bribe.
Jayamanne said the investigation was a direct result of new legal independence under the Constitution.
The 19th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka was one of the first steps taken by a new administration in 2015 stating their commitment to democracy, good governance, independence of the judiciary, and the rule of law, he said. This amendment established independent commissions namely: the Judicial Services, Police, Public Service, Human Rights, Elections, Finance, Audit and, of course the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption.
In a separate panel, Chairman of the Special Presidential Task Force on Recovery of State Assets J. C. Weliamuna said that further reform was stalled, however, by retroactive elements held over from previous governments.
He proposed creating a U.N. Working Group to examine post state capture realities in relation to fragile governance structures and bureaucracies.
In a press release, the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the U.N. in New York said that Director General Jayamanne had met with John Brandolino, Director of the Division of Treaty Affairs of the UNODC, on the sidelines of the conference.
They agreed to hold a global meeting of experts in Colombo in July, in recognition of the active role on anti-corruption played by Sri Lanka, the Mission said.
The U.N. General Assembly adopted the Convention against Corruption in 2003, and it went into force two years later. Sri Lanka ratified it in 2004, one of the first states to do so.
The treaty requires countries to implement anti-corruption measures such as prevention, law enforcement, international cooperation, asset recovery, technical assistance and information exchange.

Liverpool out to end Real hegemony in Champions League final
Kiev, Thursday: A thrilling run inspired by Mohamed Salah has taken Liverpool to Saturdays Champions League final in Kiev against Real Madrid, where now Jurgen Klopps side must stop the Spanish giants from winning the trophy for the third year running.
Real have seen this as their competition ever since winning the first five European Cups in a row, and this is another golden era for them, in which they are dreaming of making it a fourth Champions League in five years.
Neither Atletico Madrid (twice) nor Juventus have been able to stop Cristiano Ronaldo from inflicting pain on them in recent finals.
But Liverpools own attacking quality gives them reason to believe and suggests the Olympic Stadium in the Ukrainian capital could be the scene of an unforgettable encounter.
In terms of history alone, this is a dream final.
Reals 12 European Cup wins puts them way ahead of the rest, but Liverpool have lifted the famous trophy five times themselves, most recently in 2005, defying all the odds against AC Milan in Istanbul.
This time, under Klopp, their adventure started against Hoffenheim in the play-offs last August, on through stunning wins over Manchester City and Roma via a 3-3 draw in Seville when they had been three goals up.
Goals galore
They have scored a record 46 goals in all in this seasons Champions League, with Salah netting 11 of those -- the Egyptian has 44 in all competitions since joining from Roma last year.
If we win the competition then the road to Kiev plus the final would be one of the most exceptional rides ever, Klopp told Liverpools website. So far, it was just outstanding.
Klopp has lost his last five major finals as a coach, including the 2013 Champions League with Borussia Dortmund against Bayern Munich, and the 2016 Europa League with Liverpool against Sevilla.
Experience means his team have to be the outsiders in Kiev -- none of the squad have ever played in a Champions League final before -- but Klopp knows Zinedine Zidanes side cannot dismiss them.
Do Real Madrid, sitting in Madrid at the moment, think, thank God its Liverpool! I cant imagine that, added the coach, who has welcomed Emre Can back into his squad.
Salah will of course be so important, especially if Marcelo is unable to resist the temptation to abandon his left-back position and join the Real attack.
While Gareth Bale is unlikely to make Zidanes line-up, how will the Liverpool midfield cope against Casemiro, Toni Kroos and Luka Modric, their central defence against Ronaldo AFP

Massive anti-dengue campaign launched
Due to the inclement weather in Batticaloa, the MOH has informed that the threat of Dengue has risen. The Batticaloa Municipality has begun a massive anti-dengue shramadhana campaign in Periya Uppodai from yesterday (25).
12 groups including the Batticaloa Municipality Mayor T. Saravanapavan, respective councilors, Commissioner N. Manivannan, Deputy Commissioner N. Thananjeyan, Municipal officers, health labourers and PHIs have begun the shramadhana work. It was started in this area because, according to the Epidemiologist report, Sinna Uppodai was the most vulnerable for the spread of dengue.
During their campaign, lands where dengue mosquitos were liable to breed were detected and the owners of those lands prosecuted.
After inspections carried out in the areas of Thamaraikerny, Eruthayapuram West, Punnaichcholai, 54 positive cases have been identified, said MOH Batticaloa Dr. K. Kirisuthan. Fogging operations were launched by the PHIs in those areas under the guidance of the MOH Batticaloa. They have decided to make frequent inspections of these potential dengue sites.
The Mayor Saravanapavan remarked that despite all the propaganda and education about dengue to students and the public, it is saddening to note that they have not acted adequately to prevent the spread of dengue.

Matters of State
Lenin said few days before the October revolution If it comes our way let us take power, then we see what we can do with it. He was attacked by Menshevik reformist for taking the path of adventurism. It was reported that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was all light-hearted answering about coming to power. As light-hearted was the question put to him earlier then he was asked, Now that you are in power, whats your next step Pat comes the answer: The next step is to stay in power.
Certainly that is a pragmatic answer though it was not an answer typical of politicians. It was, in contrast, an honest response; thats what politics and politicians are all about. Power is the central axis of politics. Striving to obtain it and thereafter fighting to keep it is fundamental, but there should be a consistent programme; political mission to complete. Malinda says Kudos to the Prime Minister, even if it was said in jest and even though it was a slick way of spelling out things.
If you compare Premier Wickremesinghe with others in the bourgeois liberal discourse, he stands out as a person who had spelled out a democratic solution to the national democratic problems faced by Lanka; also done things, bravely facing rapacious opposition, to implement the programme. In addition to taking steps to solve the nationality problem, he has attempted to give a solution to the structural backwardness in socio-economics in Lanka.
Colonial civil service
There is a populist belief that state owned sector including state machinery is socialist and hence secure. Strangely enough this opinion has come from the colonial governance, not from socialist propaganda. The opinion that state employment is god given and one only answers to the god given rules and regulation was promoted by the colonial civil service and it continues today, even in the state corporate sector. On the other hand general public is angry over the lethargy and corruption in the state sector.
Studies conducted by various organisations have found that many Lankans are not happy about the performance of state enterprises due to issues of political interference and has stressed the need for better governance. Political intervention in the state sector organisations has been considered as peoples power over bourgeois bureaucrats by some trade unions and left politicians. After 56, masses were told that power of Niladari is over. Thus mass intervention by mass leaders  politicians became a tradition.
However, studies say that many state-owned enterprises had reported significant and persistent losses over the years which had caused social problems.
In general, the net transfers from the state to public enterprises amounted to billions more than what was estimated in the budget. A study done on 70 countries in the last period indicated that countries with higher quality institutions experienced a higher growth and low corruption.
It further estimated that countries moving towards high quality institutions had a growth rate of 26 per cent in the short term and 40 per cent in the long term. Obviously these are not small numbers.
Right to Information and Audit Acts
We are told that it was intangible capital that makes the difference. Intangible capital is composed of human capital, natural capital, institutional capital and social capital that are very relevant to Lanka in strengthening the governance framework.
Recently approved Right to Information and Audit Acts create a happy environment to improve transparency and accountability and good governance in the public sector and state enterprises. As public sector enterprises in Lanka represent a major part of the state institutions with people assuming socialist sector their governance matters greatly.
At the same time around 400 small and medium enterprises (SME) that operate play a major and key role in the countrys economy by providing infrastructure and service facilities. As pointed above good governance requires credible institutions that are built on principles of transparency and accountability to reduce poverty and to share prosperity, even under market economy.
We are not government specialists but we can relate to the impact of good and bad governance and fight for the recommendations acceptable, should be implemented. It is the citizens right and duty to demand good governance even under market economy. If enormous losses of public corporations can be stopped or minimized to a certain degree as expressed, certainly workers will be happy.
These loss-making institutions are making the countrys economy to bleed and that had gone on for a long time. The present government had taken measures to uphold the rule of law, accountability and good governance and transparency in managing the public sector.
The creations of independent commissions under the 19th Amendment such as the Right to Information Act and the proposed Audit Act and the Public Finance Act should soon become a reality.
Under mass pressure, since 2015 several far reaching steps have been taken to strengthen the supervision of the public boards.
The Auditor General too had been vested with powers to eradicate corruption in the public sector. The opposition political parties have been given a chance to participate in the COPE committee but fascistic forces have misused it.

Monsoon drive into politics of disaster
The South West Monsoon has lashed into the country with sixteen persons already dead and thousands displaced from their homes, undergoing considerable suffering and facing untold hardship. The Disaster Management and other government authorities, with the Army, Navy and Air Force are carrying out necessary and valuable services, with private, religious, and volunteer organizations also joining to help the needy.
The reports show that certain areas and those living near some major rivers and waterways the Kalu Ganga, Gin Ganga, Nilwala Ganga, Kelani Ganga and Attanagalu Oya, are facing the most hardship with this monsoon blast, as in earlier monsoon seasons and other situations of heavy downfalls, winds and storms. What is most regrettable about the situation, affecting the lives of so many Sri Lankans and even the limited economic development in the country, is the reality of this monsoonal and wider environmental tragedy being forgotten very soon, pushed back by the politics of unreality that is rapidly enveloping the people.
A study of the continuing and emerging trends of national and regional disaster from the weather shows that 70 years after independence very little has been done to address this increasingly disturbing situation facing many parts of the island; although it must be conceded that important and valuable measures to address the needs of water for irrigation have been taken in the post-independence decades. What stands out today is the absence of any serious political discussion, and proposals to seriously address the repeated disasters  of minor and major proportions  taking place every year, and the lack of initiatives to deal with the impact of climate and weather in a context of national importance.
The two major political parties in the country  the UNP and SLFP, and the now emerging SLPP, as well as the regional and minority related parties such as the TNA and SLMC, have paid very little attention to dealing with the repeated weather crises the country is facing, with increasing frequency.
Cheap politics
Much of the hardships faced by the people due to rain and the threat of landslides are clearly seen to be the result of cheap politics. People encouraged by government, provincial or local government permits to build houses on the banks of rivers, smaller waterways and canals (just as it is done near urban railway lines), and in areas clearly identified as prone to landslides. There are no signs whatever that the politics and politicians of today are ready to move away from this misuse of questionable political authority, to gather votes, with no attention whatever to the overall needs of social progress. A country with such a valuable and proud history of preserving, managing and harnessing water is showing signs of rapidly moving away from the necessities of protecting and properly managing nature, amidst the politics of a majoritarian thrust in all aspects of governance and social organisation.
The tragedies faced by the people in the latest monsoon crisis is a call for all political leaders to pay serious attention to these repetitive disasters, and come up with solutions that could be discussed by all sections of the population, irrespective of ethnicity, religion and geographical location, to carry out major flood relief, landslide prevention, and overall anti-disaster actions necessary for the progress of Sri Lankan society. Those already drawing up manifestos for the coming presidential poll already warming up to be candidates, should give due importance to this aspect of necessary national thinking, beyond the confines of the ethnic and divisive politics they are now engaged in.
Presidential pull
The recent Shangri-La move into the politics of the presidency is the stuff of much discussion in the political world, with the Gotabhaya factor playing an increasing role in manoeuvering of political alignments, especially in the context of the divisions within the SLFP. The Viyathmaga Convention at the Shangri-La has the emergence of an academic, professional, uniformed, and business line up emerging as the new base of the SLPP  which does not want to abandon its original and historic links to the SLFP. The theme of the Intellectually Inspired Sri Lanka being shown as the new elevation of political thinking in the country, shows a major departure from the founding support of the SLFP.
It is useful to remember that the SLFP, founded by SWRD Bandaranaike, went to the people in 1956 with the slogan of Sangha  Veda  Guru  Govi  Kamkaru  the Sangha, Physicians, Teachers, Cultivators and Workers  that brought together the vast sections of the rural population of this country. The move now is to present Gotabhaya as the voice of the urban power sector, having nothing to do with the rural and working classes. It is certainly a major shift in the political thinking of the Viyathmaga strategists, who are ready to move towards western inspired and influenced sections of society, while shouting slogans of ethnic and religious differences, but thinking instead of the Intellectual Inspirations of today caught in the mould of the West. These are the forces making the biggest noises about Western manipulation of the government today.
That is the crowd that filled the largest hall of the six-star luxury Shangri-La Hotel, that did get its land from what was the former property of the Defence Ministry of Sri Lanka, pushing the Army away from its headquarters, and where Gotabhaya Rajapaksa played his main role of Secretary, Ministry of Defence. The luxury space of the Shangri-La was certainly not the place for large numbers of the 'Sangha-Veda-Guru-Govi-Kamkaru' of the past or their social and political descendants of today, to find any place of congenial comfort. It is the buildup of a wholly new social strata  embracing supporters of JR Jayewardenes right wing politics that brought the authoritarian Executive Presidency, moving to the near dictatorial Mahinda Rajapaksa; bringing to it academics of limited depth in social analysis and understanding, with the uniformed ranks who cheered at the imprisonment of the Army Commander who led the battle to defeat the LTTE, and the business people of green and blue tints, the key movers in the manipulation of corrupt politics today.
The call for Gotabhaya as the Executive President and Head of State, brings the possibility of the first ever Head of Government in electoral politics, and the Head of State, too, who has never been elected to any office of service to the people. He was never a member of parliament or even a local authority. There are good reasons to look down on todays members of parliament and local bodies. But there is some background of association with people, in the search for election, no doubt spoilt by the corruption that Gotabhaya supported from 2005 to 2014.
There is a clarification needed, because Sirimavo Bandaranaike, was first appointed Prime Minister without an election in 1960. But she was appointed a member of the Senate  the 2nd Chamber of Parliament, - and did her work as Head of Government as a Member of Parliament. Her coming into politics and power was due to the assassination of her husband, certainly a shocking and tragic entry into politics and power.
There is no such shocking background for the possibility of the first non-elected Executive President of the country. The background is that of leaving the Army, when the war against the LTTE was very much on, and yes, leaving to the United States, where he obtained citizenship, and remained away from the politics of this country, until his elder brother Mahinda, was elected President in 2005, or was chosen Prime Minister in 2004.
There is much being pushed around about his role in Urban Development. Yes, there are some colonial era buildings well renovated and provided for business around Independence Square, and the Race Course in Colombo has been brought back from wasteful misuse. Some shanty towns in the city, have been removed, and high rise buildings provided for those displaced. But, that is not the stuff of Urban Development, in a major scale.
The current monsoon rains, and the quick flooding of many of the major roads in the city, and the hardships faced by many in the suburban towns in the country are certainly no show for any major contribution to Urban Development, with any inspirational drive. The rapid covering of potholes and carpeting of main roads look good, but the flaws come out when the flooding comes with any major showers, and washes away the false claims of Urban Development.
These are some of the realities of the Viyathmaga figure that do not strike the academics, ex-uniform staff, professionals, and business forces of the corrupt, pushing ahead the flower drums of Shangri-La. They will have to look deeper at the ownership of two elephants and fish that must be cared for by sailors in the official residence of a former secretary of a ministry of government. If that is the stuff of intellectual inspiration, we need to worry about both intellect and inspiration.

MP Dayasiri Jayasekara attempts to justify his actions
Responding to a newspaper report published on Thursday, revealing that he had received a cheque of Rs.1 million from Walt & Row Associates - a Perpetual Treasuries Ltd, related group company in 2015, UPFA Parliamentarian Dayasiri Jayasekara, not denying the allegation, made an attempt to justify his actions by admitting that at every election, not only those who are in Parliament, or Provincial Councillors, but the trader in the village helps the Pradeshiya Sabha member.
That is how the countrys politics works. Therefore, some businessmen do help us, they have done so even at the Provincial Council elections, General elections and the Presidential elections as well.
It is traditional that the business community helps politicians at every election, Jayasekara said.
However, he noted that he was not a COPE Committee member at the time and was appointed to Parliament only on August 17, 2015.
The news report stated that based on a statement given to the CID by a Police officer who was attached to Jayasekaras security in 2015, on June 13, 2015 Jayasekara had asked his Security Officer, Amila Kumara Herath, to encash a cash cheque (Bearing number 566635) which was issued by Walt & Row Associates (under the current account number 0073900773). The said Security Officer had told the CID that he had encashed the cheque from a Kurunegala Bank and handed the Money in cash to Jayasekara.
However, Jayasekara said in Parliament that at every instance he had stood up against Arjun Mahendrans illegal acts both at the COPE Committee and in Parliament. Hence, what is important is who we represented and in this instance, this cheque is not one that was written in my name. I inquired about this but have no recollection of who gave it and who encashed it. I am truly unaware if Arjun Aloysius had signed this cheque or who had signed it. But, we had encashed this cheque and utilised that money for our election campaign, Jayasekara admitted in Parliament yesterday joining the Parliamentary debate over several orders under the Appropriation Act.
He said there are many who have taken money from Arjun Aloysius and he could reveal these names, urging the authorities to take measures to reveal the identities of those who had accepted money from Arjun Aloysius and table in parliament the balance 3000 page report on the Bond scam.
Noting that he had never worked to safeguard Arjun Aloysius and clear him from the allegations he faced, adding that this is a smear campaign that has been unleashed against him after he and 15 others had opted to step out of the Government.
We have not taken money from Arjun Aloysius and tried to protect him. I never wrote books on the Bond issue and never went to court on behalf of Arjun Aloysius and never represented him and tried to stop the investigation, he added.

Nadal happy to suffer in pursuit of 11th French Open
Paris, Friday: Rafael Nadal said Friday he is happy to suffer as he chases an 11th French Open title.
The top seed is the overwhelming favourite to lift a 17th career major at Roland Garros after claiming his 11th titles on clay in both Monte Carlo and Barcelona this spring as well as an eighth trophy in Rome.
In the end, sport is about trying to give the best of yourself, said the 31-year-old.
The sensations of matches of three or four hours, played at the limit and thinking about the next point, these are beautiful moments.
It is to suffer but also to appreciate the moment you are living in. If you are suffering you know how to value it, how to enjoy it.
With Roger Federer and Andy Murray not playing at the French Open, which starts on Sunday, Nadal is the short-odds favourite to win a tournament where his overall record stands at an astonishing 79 wins and just two losses.
His expected stranglehold has been further tightened by former champions Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka attempting to regroup after long-term injuries.
Djokovic, the champion in Paris in 2016, has seen his ranking slip to 22 after an elbow injury.Wawrinka, also the runner-up to Nadal last year, has only this week returned after three months on the sidelines having undergone knee surgery.
However, Nadal remains wary of the danger posed by Djokovic who he defeated in the Rome semi-finals last week.
Novak is one of the best players in the history of this sport, said Nadal.
My answer is hes not coming back -- hes there always. AFP

KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP
New Mayor Kesara to develop playgrounds
Thats good that the new Mayor of Kandy Kesara Senanayake is on the correct track looking to upgrade all playgrounds which are badly in need of up uplifting. A look back into playgrounds reveals that it was introduced in 1938. The first was the Rakade grounds and also known as the Welpitiya playgrounds now it is called P.T. Rajan playgrounds. Then came the Victoria Drive playground and the third was Deyanawella playground now known as Edmund Silva Playground. At present there are over 20 playgrounds, which help the area sportsmen at grass root level. Today there are some top coaches in these play grounds department but sad to say in the last three years few community centers where they promote indoor had to be closed due to members rivalry. All playgrounds are pocket size. No matches can be played; every playground in recent times has come out with side net wickets. For coaches to conduct their classes for football, rugger and hockey there is no proper grounds. Only ground they had for matches was the Bogambara stadium that too was taken over by the sports ministry by force and the loss of this ground is badly felt. When it was under the Municipality the ground charge was only a few hundred rupees. Today it is sky-high and poor schools and clubs are finding it difficult to pocket out this money.Hillwood

No replacement for Dhananjaya
Sri Lanka Cricket will not replace batsman Dhananjaya de Silva who withdrew from a tour of the West Indies following the murder of his father, officials said Friday.
Ranjan de Silva, a local politician, was shot dead near Colombo late Thursday, hours before the team was due to leave for the three-match Test series in the West Indies. There will be no replacement for Dhananjaya, a board official told AFP. Instead of a 17-member squad, we will now have 16.
Sri Lanka Cricket said it will support the 26-year-old Dhananjaya at this time of sorrow and grief. Police said an investigation was underway but no arrests had been made. Sri Lanka will also miss opener Dimuth Karunaratne who fractured a finger while batting in the nets this month as he prepared for a domestic tournament. Revised Sri Lanka squad: Dinesh Chandimal (capt), Mahela Udawatte, Kusal Mendis, Kusal Janith Perera, Roshen Silva, Angelo Mathews, Niroshan Dickwella, Rangana Herath, Dilruwan Perera, Akila Dananjaya, Jeffrey Vandersay, Lahiru Gamage, Kasun Rajitha, Suranga Lakmal, Lahiru Kumara, and Asitha Fernando.

Pakistan lead by 166 runs
LONDON May25: Pakistan were 350 for eight in reply to England's first-innings 184, a lead of 166 runs, at stumps on the second day of the first Test at Lord's on Friday.
Mohammad Amir was 19 not out and Mohammad Abbas unbeaten on nought after four Pakistan batsmen made fiftties, Babar Azam top-scoring with 68 before retiring hurt.
Babar Azam helped take Pakistan into a first-innings lead at tea on Friday's second day of the first Test against England at Lord's. But an over before England could take the new ball, Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed (nine) top-edged a hook off Ben Stokes to Mark Wood at fine leg.
That was the last ball before tea, with Pakistan 227 for five in reply to England's 184, a lead of 43 runs, at the interval.
Babar was 59 not out, having become the third batsman this innings to make a fifty after opener Azhar Ali (50) and Asad Shafiq (59). Pakistan pacemen Mohammad Abbas and Hasan Ali had shown good discipline while taking four wickets apiece on Thursday. The tourists' batsmen, all of whom played in similarly overcast conditions during a recent five-wicket win over Test debutants Ireland, demonstrated similar application -- something England largely lacked in their first innings with the exception of former captain Alastair Cook's 70.
Pakistan resumed Friday on 50 for one, with Azhar 18 not out and Haris Sohail 21 not out.
The second-wicket duo continued to be watchful in defence, while cashing in on loose deliveries.
Azhar drilled Stuart Broad through the covers and forced all-rounder Stokes off the back foot through point for another boundary. Left-hander Haris, meanwhile, drove England spearhead James Anderson down the ground.
But fast bowler Wood eventually ended a partnership worth 75 runs when, having tried to rough up both batsmen from around the wicket, he slipped in a fuller-length delivery that Haris (39) edged to wicket-keeper Jonny Bairstow.
The experienced Azhar completed a 133-ball fifty but had failed to add to his score when he was lbw to Anderson, England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker, who had been switched to the Nursery End by Root.
Pakistan ended the session with a flourish as Shafiq hoisted debutant off-spinner Dominic Bess for a six over midwicket and at lunch they were 136 for three.
A feature of Pakistan's play on Thursday had been their much-improved close catching.
England by contrast, saw Cook drop Babar on 10 in the slips when the former Test captain failed to hold a low chance.
An unconcerned Babar then stylishly forced all-rounder Stokes off the back foot for four. England's Jos Buttler, playing as a specialist batsman rather than a wicket-keeper on his Test recall, appeared to lose sight of the ball when an edge from Shafiq, on 36, flew through the cordon.
England then squandered a review for a catch behind when Shafiq was on 48, even though it seemed clear that the ball had come off the batsman's elbow.
Shafiq completed an 81-ball fifty and was then missed again on 59 when a diving Buttler could not hold a tough gully catch. But next ball Shafiq's luck ran out when he lobbed a rising Stokes delivery to Dawid Malan in the slips to end a stand of 84.
Babar, however, kept going and a cut off Bess -- his seventh boundary -- saw him to a 93-ball half-century. AFP

Parliament to send 20th Amendment to AG, PM
Parliament is to send the 20th Amendment to the Constitution (20A) to abolish the Executive Presidency presented by the JVP to the Attorney General(AG) and the Prime Minister (PM).
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake handed over the 20A to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Parliament Secretary General Dhammika Dasanayake at the Parliament Complex yesterday.
MP Dissanayake, speaking to the media after the submission of the 20A as a Private Members Bill along with MPs Sunil Handunnetti, Nihal Galappatti and Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa, said President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe must make known to the public their positions on the abolition of the Executive Presidency.
He pointed out if the Government has a genuine interest in delivering its pre-election pledge of abolishing the Executive Presidency, it can present the Bill in Parliament and pass it within a period of 2-3 months.
It can be procrastinated if the Government has no interest. We are ready for a broad discussion with all political parties and accommodate amendments as necessary. We are open for constructive criticism, he added.
The Bill has to be Gazetted after the approval of the AG before it is presented in Parliament.
Responding to a question by a journalist, the MP pointed out their initiative to present the 20A came with the realisation that the space for a new Constitution is fast shrinking with the latest developments in the political sphere.
Since the new Constitution is a distant reality, our effort is to push for more democratic reforms, he said.
The Executive Presidency has created many unwanted problems over time. Excessive Presidential powers have eroded all democratic institutions. Parliament is a mere rubber seal and the Cabinet of Ministers are reduced to puppets under the Executive Presidency. Even the Judiciary could be influenced. Since the day the Executive Presidency came into being, there has been a strong voice against it. All successive Presidents, who came to power after 1994, pledged to abolish it in their election manifestoes.
This was one of the main election slogans of Common Candidate Sirisena. This Government cannot get away from this undertaking. We challenge the two leaders at the helm to say in public their positions on abolition of Executive Presidency, he told the media.
He pointed out that the JVP is not keen on engaging with groups having worship mentality who wants to retain the Executive Presidency for their own survival.
Under the proposed 20th Amendment, the President will be appointed by Parliament, instead of a Presidential Election. The President will continue to be the Head of State and the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, but he will no longer be the Head of Government and the Head of Cabinet of Ministers. The proposed 20th Amendment will be implemented only after the current term of office of President Maithripala Sirisena.

Despite countrys difficult situation, govt. boasting of tax exempted commodities
One does not need to go through piles of books and dig up numbers to get a feeling of the governments failed economic policy, but it is amply visible if we look at the life of the ordinary citizen, if we look at the countrys crumbling industries, if we look at the uncertainty that is prevalent in the lives of farmers and the rate of unemployed youth.
Yet, despite the pathetic situation the countrys economy is at, the government is still boasting about having exempted certain commodities from non-duty levies of around 1,200 imported items. The State Finance Minister confidently gloats that the government is ready to lift the levy from another 3,000 imported items within the next three years, he added.
Noting that a certain Chinese manufactured phone which costs $7 to manufacture, is being imported to Sri Lanka for $ 6.50. Why would they do this. It is because the government pays them a dollar for every phone that is imported, so they earn $ 50 cents per phone. Under these conditions, how could anyone else compete This is the reason other countries impose certain levies in order to protect their domestic industries, Dissanayake pointed out.
He noted that in Sri Lanka, the production cost is very high in comparison to other countries such as India. This is why potatoes imported from India, in addition to shipping costs and other taxes, is still cheaper in the market in comparison to the local potatoes. Other countries have taken measures to protect their domestic market. Yet now what the government is proposing is to remove all levies on imported items, other than duty and make local manufacturers compete with the imported market. Yet although the government wants the domestic producer to compete on a global scale, what concessions have you provided the local producers In fact, even electricity bills of our local industries is extremely high, which is almost the highest in the South Asian region. Yet the government is not paying any attention to these issues faced by the local manufacturers, but wants them to compete on the same level as international markets. This is the failed new liberal economic policies of this government, he noted.
Dissanayake said that former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had recently said during a speech that corruption should be eradicated from the State sector. Yet they were the people who sold the Army headquarters lands to Chinese companies, while spending far more than what was gained in that transaction for the construction of a military headquarters in another location.
There were 14 islands that was under former minister Basil Rajapakss purview and all these islands were put up for sale during their tenure. These are the failed economic policies that were adopted by both these parties, Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.
Govt. plans to reduce import duty on construction material:Eran
The Government is contemplating on a reduction of import duties on construction material including cement, steel billets and floor tiles, Finance and Mass Media State Minister Eran Wickramaratne implied in Parliament yesterday.
Speaking at the Parliamentary debate on several Orders under the Appropriation Act, the State Minister said the Government has to strike a balance between protecting local industrialists and providing construction material at an affordable price for consumers, especially the low-income people.
He reminded that Finance and Mass Minister Mangala Samaraweera when presenting the previous Budget, said that the Government intends to gradually remove para-tariffs numbering to over 7,000 and as a first step, about 1,200 para-tariffs not coming under the Customs duties were removed under a budgetary proposal. In the next two years, we intend to remove the rest of para-tariffs as much as possible, while taking measures to protect the local industrialists, he said.
He observed that a 120-130 percent import duty applied to floor tiles and therefore, the prices of floor tiles are high in the market and ordinary people cannot afford them. There are only three local companies making tiles and the total number of workers does not exceed 10,000. However, there are hundreds of thousands of consumers who wish to buy them. If we are to apply very high taxes simply to protect the producer, it could be unfair to the consumers, he commented.
He pointed out 700,000 title deeds are ready to be presented under the Governments policy to offer out-right ownership of the lands to two million people. Those will be awarded in the near future. In order to build houses in those lands, the prices of construction material such as cement and steel billets must come down. About 91-103 percent import duty applies to steel billets. The Government intends to take several measures in the near future to strike a balance in this regard, the State Minister said.
JO MP tables copy of Sri Lanka - Singapore FTA in Parliament
Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena tabled a copy of the Sri Lanka - Singapore Free Trade Agreement in Parliament yesterday.
MP Gunawardena, speaking at the Parliamentary debate over several Orders under the Appropriation Act, said the Government which signed the Agreement had so failed to table it in Parliament and therefore he tabled a copy of it for the future references of all MPs.
He added that the Agreement contained over thousand pages and weighed over 3 kgs. Any MP could peruse the Agreement and understands the facts, he said, while commenting on the detrimental impact of the FTA with Singapore to the local job market.
Strategic Development and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama, speaking in Parliament on Tuesday, agreed to table the Agreement, adding that it is freely available on the website for anybody to peruse.
Speaker concerned over MP Nishanthas remanding
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday, told Parliament that he could not approve the way in which Joint Opposition MP Sanath Nishantha Perera was being remanded for three months.
The Speaker made this comment in response to MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena who brought the attention of the House that MP Perera was being remanded for more than three months because he had failed to appear before the Police.
The Chillaw High Court remanded him again on Thursday, as the judge was absent. This is not fair. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and JO MPs met you about three times to discuss this matter, MP Gunawardena said.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella, intervening at this point, said MP Gunawardena being a senior Parliamentarian should understand that the Speaker could not give bail. He is trying to make you interfere into judicial affairs, he told the Speaker, stating that it was even wrong to speak on this matter in Parliament, as it relates to an on-going case. You represented Parliament since 1983. Dont you know that the Speaker cannot bail out any person The best thing for you to do is to consult a talented lawyer, he told MP Gunawardena.
The Speaker said he spoke to Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale over the matter and she too agreed that it was not fair. The arrest was due to an incident which happened 4 - 5 years back. I also spoke to MP Perera over the phone. I am also of the view that this arrest was very unfair. I am also concerned as he is one of our fellow MPs. I spoke to the Attorney General as well. It is not fair to postpone the case stating that the judge was absent. Let me take further steps in this regard, he replied.

Patients with upper respiratory tract infection increasing in Matara
Figures obtained from hospital sources showed that the number of patients admitted to the Matara District General Hospital with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection had almost doubled in the past week with relation to the week before.
A total of 313 patients (145 children and 168 adults) diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection were admitted to the Matara District General Hospital between May 14 and 20 while only 164 patients (89 children and 75 adults) were admitted between May 7 and 13. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), seasonal influenza viruses circulate and cause disease in humans every year. In Sri Lanka, for the last few years, it has been generally observed during April to June and again in November to January. It spreads from person to person through sneezing, coughing or touching contaminated surfaces. Seasonal influenza viruses can cause mild to severe illness and even death, particularly in some high-risk individuals. Persons at increased risk for severe disease include pregnant women, the very young and the very old, immune-compromised people and those with chronic underlying medical conditions such as cancer, diabetes mellitus and heart diseases.
Seasonal influenza viruses evolve continuously, which means that people can get infected multiple times throughout their lives.
Sources at the DGH Matara said patients diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection are admitted to the hospital throughout the year while there is sharp increase at this time of year as the climatic conditions become ideal for the virus to spread. It was stated that the unusually sharp increase within the past week was a matter of concern.
A WHO report states that Influenza A (H1N1) is the commonly circulating seasonal influenza - a virus subtype in Sri Lanka. During the current season, it has been observed to generally cause severe disease. This seasonal A (H1N1) virus is the same virus that caused the influenza pandemic and it first appeared in Sri Lanka in two waves during 2009/ 10 period.
Ten to 15 samples of nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained from patients diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infections warded at the DGH Matara are sent to the Medical Research Institute (MRI) for testing each month. Of the 15 samples submitted in April, only one patient tested positive for Influenza type A virus while in the month of May, 5 of the 39 samples submitted have tested positive.
Two deaths of persons suffering from respiratory tract infection have been recorded at the DGH Matara in the months of April and May. One was a 26-year-old female who was pregnant while the other was a 59-year-old male. Although samples obtained from the deceased had been submitted to the MRI, the authorities had not received the results as yet.
The hospital authorities in Matara had taken all measures to stop the disease from spreading and may even restrict the number of visitors to two per patient as a precaution.

Claims SLC elections on May 31 is illegal
Ramanayake makes another scathing attack on Sumathipala
In another scathing attack on incumbent president of Sri Lanka Cricket who is also the Deputy Speaker of Parliament Thilanga Sumathipala, Deputy Minister of Social Empowerment and Welfare Ranjan Ramanayake said that he plans to file a case against Sumathipala as he is not qualified to hold the post of president of SLC.
Sumathipala cannot contest the cricket board elections. I claim that the election of the cricket board that is to be held on May 31 is illegal. We hope to launch a protest with regard to this, said Ramanayake at special press conference held at his Madiwala Parliamentary quarters yesterday.
We are disappointed that world cricket stars like A.B de Villiers and Virat Kohli have derided our country in a television program.
We have dropped to 9th place from 1st in T20 cricket. Sumathipala speaks only about profit- making. If we had been able to preserve the quality of our cricket, we could have derived more profits than what he claims we have made, he said.
Speaking further Ramanayake said, There are two other clauses that would make Sumathipala ineligible for the SLC presidency.
An individual who has four years prior to the submission of nominations, been engaged in selling or supplying sports goods, sports gear or any item or equipment relating to such sport to such National Association of Sports and if he is directly or indirectly involved in carrying out the business of gaming, betting or wagering, he is ineligible to contest. Didnt the former Sports Minister (Dayasiri Jayasekera) know all this
Ramanayake further said that he is not seeking popularity by speaking of corruption in Sri Lanka Cricket and added: I am an actor by profession and I have the right to raise my voice against corruption as a publicly elected representative.
I was elected by the people of Sri Lanka as a member of parliament and I wasnt rejected by the people at the last election like Sumathipala.
In every country their respective Cricket Boards are administered by gentlemen but not in Sri Lanka where all corrupted people stick with SLC for their own personnel benefits.
I am also one of the ordinary fans of cricket among the millions of people in the country who has a basic knowledge of cricket.
I am a representative of the people. Wherever I go to contest an election, people elect me with their preferential votes.
They have sent me here to talk about the issues with public interest. I am bound to solve their problems, Ramanayake said. He challenged Sumathipala to answer his allegations.

Rockets outlast Warriors, edge closer to NBA Finals
Los Angeles, Friday: The Houston Rockets clawed out a 98-94 victory over the reigning champion Golden State Warriors on Thursday to move within one win of reaching the NBA Finals.
The Rockets, who led the league with 65 regular-season wins, took a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven Western Conference finals and with one more victory can deny the Warriors a fourth straight trip to the championship series.
For us nothing changes, Rockets star James Harden said of Houstons mindset on the brink of the clubs first trip to the Finals since winning back-to-back titles in 1994 and 1995.
We just take it game by game, position by position, try to compete our butts off and give ourselves the best chance.
Golden State, whose streak of 16 straight home playoff wins was halted by the Rockets on Tuesday, will try to fend off elimination when they host game six on Saturday.
I feel great about where we are right now, insisted Warriors coach Steve Kerr. That may sound crazy but I feel it. I know exactly what Im seeing out there and we defended them beautifully tonight.
The winner of the series will face either the Cleveland Cavaliers or Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals starting on May 31.
The Cavaliers, who have played the Warriors in each of the last three title series, trail the Celtics 3-2 in the Eastern Conference finals.
Houston point guard Chris Paul scored 18 of his 20 points in the second half as the Western Conference heavyweights went toe-to-toe.
Theyre not going to let you win on points, youve got to knock em out, Rockets coach Mike DAntoni said.
I thought our guys just hung in there, hung in there and found a way, added DAntoni, whose Rockets shot just 37/2 percent from the floor. It wont go down as a classic, but it should go down as a hard-fought win.
In a game that saw 16 lead changes, the Warriors led by one going into the fourth quarter.
But Eric Gordon scored 10 of his 24 points off the bench for Houston in the final frame to help the Rockets turn the tide.
Gordon drained a three-pointer to put Houston up by four points with 1:21 remaining, and he came up with the ball after Draymond Green lost it on Golden States last possession.
Houstons Most Valuable Player candidate Harden struggled from the floor -- missing all 11 of his three-point attempts -- but finished with 19 points.
The only downside for Houston was a right hamstring injury to Paul that saw him limp off in the final minute.
Paul connected on just six of 19 shots from the field, but the baskets he made proved crucial.
Pauls three three-pointers in the third quarter included a tough one over Stephen Curry, after which Paul gave a little Curry-style shoulder shimmy that drew a smile from the Warriors star.
What he did was remarkable, Rockets coach Mike DAntoni said of Paul.
When we were kind of teetering he made two or three threes -- thats just his heart. They werent great shots, he made something out of nothing.
Kevin Durant led the Warriors with 29 points, but made just eight of 22 shots from the field and missed all four of his attempts in the fourth quarter.
Klay Thompson scored 23 points and Curry added 22 for Golden State.
We played well tonight, Curry said, just not well enough.
The Rockets honored victims and survivors of the deadly shooting at Santa Fe High School, where a teenage gunman killed 10 people and injured 13 others on May 18.
The team provided tickets for more than 300 Santa Fe High seniors, along with some staff and first responders. The schools choir sang the national anthem before the contest. AFP

The Student Action Committee of SAITM sent a letter to the University Grants Commission yesterday evening requesting an appointment for a meeting with the Higher Education Minister Wijedasa Rajapaksa, the Convener of the committee Shanaka De Seram said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Centre for Society and Religion (CSR) in Colombo yesterday, he said that since no authority gave an appointment for a discussion the committee is compelled to demand an appointment in writing for a discussion. The SAITM students had never been invited for any previous discussions held in connection with solving the SAITM issue.
According to Seram, all the solutions given by the Government for the SAITM issue so far, were limited to various cabinet papers and had not been implemented in practice. At least the cabinet paper presented recently, should be implemented in practice in a fair and expedited manner. If not, the SAITM students will be compelled to come into streets and block roads, which is the popular way of opening eyes of the Government.
Meanwhile, some others are purposely delaying the task of finding a final and acceptable solution for the SAITM issue because they want to take political advantage using the issue. The 980 SAITM students are local investors and it is the sole responsibility of the Government to protect them. But what the Government does is giving high hopes to the SAITM students and later breaking them down into pieces, De Seram added.

PARIS, Thursday: Three-time champion Serena Williams will face Kristyna Pliskova of the Czech Republic in the French Open first round after the draw was made on Thursday with a potential clash against bitter rival Maria Sharapova in the last 16.
Former world number one Williams, now ranked a lowly 453, is playing a Grand Slam for the first time since she won her 23rd major at the 2017 Australian Open after which she stepped off the tour to give birth to her daughter in September. Pliskova, the twin sister of world number six Karolina, has never won a main draw match at Roland Garros. Williams has played just four matches on the tour in 2018 and not featured at all since Miami in March.
Sharapova, champion in 2012 and 2014, could face Serena in the fourth round.
The Russian who missed last year's event after she was refused a wild card as she battled to rebuild her career following a 15-month doping ban, has not defeated Williams since 2004.  AFP

Sports Minister lays down strict conditions to resume schools rugby
Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapha laid down strict conditions for school rugby to resume from Monday May 28 after a meeting with Senior DIG Colombo Lalith Pathinayake and other officials connected with rugby yesterday.
A media release from the Ministry of Sports states the Ministers attention was drawn to the violent incidents which occurred last week in the Singer Schools rugby tournament.
The Minister inquired from the Senior DIG Colombo Lalith Pathinayake what course of action could be taken after scrutinizing the video clips. The DIG informed that action could be taken after a complaint is made.
The Minister immediately directed the Schools Rugby Association to make a complaint with the police. He also directed that all video clips be handed over to the police. The Minister also requested that the culprits responsible should be arrested after studying the video clips and also the police should refuse bail.
Minister Mustapha further said that the culprits responsible for the violent incidents which occurred during the tournament that brought disrepute and caused damage to property should not be brought before a reconciliation board and treated leniently.
He pointed out that this would only lead to more violent incidents in the future and said that future incidents could be prevented if appropriate punishment is given and discipline maintained in future tournaments.
The Minister pointed out that the incidents that occurred during school tournaments was a direct result of liquor. In future the principal of the school, old boys, teachers and organizers should ensure that liquor is not brought into the grounds and consumed when rugby matches are underway.
In future the cardboard heroes who acted in this disgraceful manner will not be permitted to watch matches.
At the meeting the requirement for more tournament referees was also identified and the Minister also agreed to provide funds for the technical facilities.
The following conditions were laid down and adhered to:
lAll those responsible for the violent incidents which occurred to be brought to task and appropriate punishment meted out;
lSale of liquor in and around grounds hosting rugby tournaments to be banned and no one consuming liquor will be permitted entry to the grounds;

Sri Lanka committed to preserve Universal Health Coverage - Minister Rajitha
The Government of Sri Lanka is committed to preserve Universal Health Coverage, which has been a commitment of our successive governments, to provide free health care through a government pioneered health care delivery system, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had stated.
Addressing the 71st World Health Assembly now taking place in Geneva, he stated that having understood the challenges in doing so, Sri Lankan Government is now ready to take the health care delivery system through a much needed reform process that will further improve access and coverage for the pressing health needs of non-communicable diseases, elderly, injuries, mental health, cancer, nutrition related challenges and the emerging communicable diseases.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that meanwhile, the good health outcomes achieved in maternal and child health care and communicable diseases such as elimination of malaria, Filariasis and maintaining a low prevalence for HIV, will be extended and broad based through the planned reorganization of the health care delivery system. Sri Lanka has taken measures for controlling Tobacco smoking by introducing 80 percent pictorial warning, 90 percent taxation of tobacco products, banning the sale of tobacco products around a 100 meter radius from schools, smoking in public places and advertising in mass media and in public places, while measures are also being taken to introduce plain packaging and a ban on single stick sales.
We have successfully introduced a Traffic Light system and a tax scheme for sugar sweetened beverages soon to be introduced to several other food items including selected snack foods. Such a scheme will be introduced for salt and trans fats shortly. We note that much more effort needs to go into controlling the abuse of Alcohol. I think this is a regional problem as well, the Minister said. "We note that Human resources in health will be a critical factor for our progress. Our health service is manned by close to 135,000 health care personnel (17,000 doctors, 32,000 nurses and rest paramedical). We need to do an in-depth study of the skills and numbers required in different cadres in keeping with what we envisage for primary care strengthening. Whilst we indeed need the technical support for such analysis, we also need to strengthen HR policy and strategic functions that would be mainstreamed within our organisation", said the Minister.
"We consider Migrants, both inbound and outbound as being vulnerable. We very recently entered into a partnership with the International Organisation for Migration which will establish a Health Assessment programme for inbound long stay visa applicants. The Health assessment is intended to link those with TB, HIV, Malaria and Filariasis, with our national control programmes. This will ensure them with treatment and will also protect public health in our country. Similarly, national guidelines prepared for pre departure health assessments for our own citizens will also ensure referral of many of those with identified health problems to our national health system to be managed free of charge", the Minister said.
"There is a continuing challenge that we have not resolved, namely, Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown aetiology. We appreciate guidance and assistance extended by WHO to improve our understanding, find solutions, a prevention strategy and improve our clinical management practices. We are also thankful for the assistance extended by the Chinese government in setting up a research centre and much needed treatment facilities and we are mindful that we have a long way to go to see a reversal of the situation for the better", the Minister concluded.

Ten records that might never be broken
The 2018 edition of FIFA World Cup will run from 14 June to 15 July in Russia across 11 cities and 12 stadia. Some of the world's greatest footballers will display their skills and look forward to bring home the trophy. Moreover, it is that part of the year when everyone becomes a football pundit.
Which club does the third-choice goalkeeper of a particular team play Which players are playing their first and last World Cup Which record will be broken if that player scores They have the answer to all such questions.
If you are one of those pundits, then you have come across the right article. Here we present before you 10 FIFA World Cup records that might never be broken.
HIGHEST ATTENDANCE IN A WORLD CUP MATCH
The record for the highest attendance in a FIFA World Cup match is officially 173,830 in the Estadio de Maracana at the 1950 Jules Rimet Cup. Unofficially, it was 199,854.
This match was called the "decisive match" because of it was the final game in a round-robin format with both sides in with a shout of taking the trophy home.
The match between Brazil and Uruguay would decide the title; a victory or a draw would grant Brazil the title, whereas Uruguay had to win the match in order to win the championship.
Brazil were the clear favorites to lift the trophy and Uruguay didn't even appear as a threat on paper. However, the unthinkable had happened as Uruguay overcame the 1-0 deficit and won 2-1.
It is highly unlikely that this record might be broken. At the time, the Maracan was mostly concrete grandstands with no seats. And right now, most international football matches are played in all-seater stadiums.
Moreover, the largest stadium in the world, the May Day stadium at Pyongyang in North Korea, only has a capacity of 150,000. Whosoever wants to break the record will not only have to win the bid but also create a larger stadium.
LONGEST SUSPENSION IN A WORLD CUP QUALIFYING CAMPAIGN
The ill-famed record for the longest suspension in a qualifying campaign is held by the Chile's Roberto Rojas. FIFA suspended the goalkeeper for life following his infamous act to get hurt by a flare thrown by a Brazilian fan at Chile's 1990 World Cup qualifier against Brazil.
FIFA would later give an amnesty in 2000 reducing his ban to 12 years. The event is known as Maracanazo de la seleccin Chilena meaning 'The Maracanazo of the Chilean Team'.
After questioning, Rojas confessed to having cut himself with a razor blade hidden in one of his gloves, and that Chilean coach Orlando Aravena had asked Rojas and team doctor Daniel Rodrguez to stay on the pitch to force a scandal, with the purpose of nullifying the result of the game.
With the advancements in technology, it is highly improbable that an act of such nature could be pulled. But, if teams resort to match-fixing, FIFA wouldn't hesitate to slap a life ban on the players.
Let's hope that none of the future players stoop to such tricks and this record is never broken.
YOUNGEST COACH TO MANAGE A WORLD CUP SIDE
The record for the youngest coach to manage a FIFA World Cup is held by Argentina's Juan Jose Tramutola. The Argentinian received the honor of being the youngest coach ever at the 1930 World Cup at the age of just 27 years and 267 days when Argentina played their first match against France.
Some other notable achievements include guiding Argentina to the 1929 Copa America triumph and a second-place finish at the inaugural 1930 World Cup.
It is a dream for all the managers to coach a World Cup side, and Tramutola achieved it so early in his life. Nowadays, none of the federations appoint a manager without ample experience at this era.
Even if they do become a manager at a younger age, it would be a Herculean task to make their team qualify for the World Cup.
FASTEST GOAL FROM KICK OFF IN A WORLD CUP
Hakan Sukur of Turkey holds the current record for scoring the fastest goal from kickoff at a FIFA World Cup.
The Bull of Bosphorus had represented the senior team 112 times and scored 51 goals in the process. He even displayed his goal-scoring prowess in the club football netting 260 goals in 540 appearances.
Turkey was coming into the match after a 1-0 loss to Brazil and South Korea with a similar scoreline against Germany. The hosts didn't want to end their campaign empty-handed and looked forward to picking up the victory. The home fans were screaming on top of their lungs but a fine display of skill from Hakan Sukur silenced them.
With only 10.8 seconds after the referee's whistle, the Turk found the back of the net. By doing so, he broke Czechoslovakia's Vaclav Masek earlier record of 16 seconds.
Clint Dempsey broke into the top five fastest goals in FIFA World Cup history at the 2014 edition after his 29th-second goal against Ghana. But, that is how near he could get.
However, Belgium's Christian Benteke scored a goal in the 9th-second (8.1 seconds) against Gibraltar in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. Could he replicate that at the World Cup
WINNING THE WORLD CUP IN THEIR FIRST APPEARANCE
Italy and Uruguay are the only two countries to win the World Cup in their first appearance. Uruguay won the inaugural 1930 FIFA World Cup and Italy won the 1934 edition. Coincidentally, both had won the title when they were the hosts.
Iceland and Panama will be making their first appearance at Russia. Could they write their name in the history books alongside Uruguay and Italy
Well, the thought seems far-fetched. However, they could spring some upsets and knock out Croatia and England from their groups.
History suggests that this record can be broken at the 2022 World Cup. If a country participates in the FIFA World Cup for the first time as a host, they are bound to win it.
The 1930 FIFA World Cup was the inaugural one, and Uruguay was the host and the winner. Italy didn't participate in the 1930 FIFA World Cup and won the 1934 World Cup as hosts.
So, by that logic, Qatar could win the 2022 FIFA World Cup! Sorry, Qatar fans but this idea seems pretty far-fetched at the moment.
BIGGEST MARGIN OF VICTORY IN A WORLD CUP QUALIFYING MATCH
Australia holds the record for the biggest margin of victory in a qualifying match against American Samoa. They had defeated them by a whopping scoreline of 31-0 in the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.
This wasn't the only record created in the match. Australia's Archie Thompson also broke the record for most goals scored by a player in an international match by scoring 13 goals. David Zdrillic, who scored eight goals in the match, became the second highest goalscorer in a single international match since World War I.
To prevent such lopsided victories, a preliminary round for the smaller teams in the qualification was re-introduced. With other federations like the AFC, CAF, and CONCACAF also implementing such measures, it is highly unlikely that this record would be broken.
FASTEST RED CARD IN A WORLD CUP
The record for the fastest send-off in a FIFA World Cup is held by Uruguay's Jose Batista. He was sent off after just 56 seconds in their game against Scotland at the 1986 World Cup.
The Uruguayan played a monumental role in helping his team qualify for the World Cup. The fans expected him to play as an example and steer their way to triumph. However, in their final group stage match against Scotland, he couldn't control his aggression.
He threw in a devastating sliding tackle to the opposing midfielder Gordon Strachan, and the referee would give a straight red. Thanks to his notoriety, the Uruguayan would find his name in the Guinness Books and Uruguay qualified to the next round after a 0-0 draw.
The record for the fastest red card, not as a substitute, is held by Lee Todd. He was sent 2 seconds after the kickoff, following foul language in his game for Cross Park Farm Celtic against Taunton East Reach Wanderers.
While there might have been quicker send-offs in club football, it is highly unlikely the demons would follow in the FIFA World Cup.
YOUNGEST REFEREE TO OFFICIATE IN A WORLD CUP
The record for the youngest referee to officiate in the FIFA World Cup is held by Spain's Juan Gardeazabal.
At the 1958 FIFA World Cup, Gardeazabal refereed in Paraguay's 3-7 drubbing in the hands of France.
He was only 24 years and 193 days old at the time of officiating and had inscribed his name in the history books.
He would also be the referee in the quarter-final match between France and Northern Ireland. Coincidentally, France also won that game with a four-goal margin (4-0).
Ricardo Montero will be the youngest referee in the 2018 FIFA World Cup. But, even he is 32 years old. Michael Oliver became the youngest Premier League referee in the 2013 League Cup final when he was 25 years and 182 days old.
But, can anyone break the record of Juan Gardeazabal We highly doubt it.
FEWEST MATCHES PLAYED BY A COUNTRY IN A WORLD CUP
Indonesia holds the present record for the fewest matches played by a country in a FIFA World Cup. Indonesia, then known as Dutch East Indies, qualified automatically for the 1938 FIFA World Cup. Alas, Hungary hammered them 6-0 in their first game and sent them home packing. FIFA has since changed their format of the World Cup. Now, all countries have to participate in a group stage in order to qualify for the knockout rounds.
That means, all the countries have to play a minimum of three matches if they qualify for the World Cup.So, unless FIFA changes their format again, which is highly unlikely, this record may never be broken. However, if Indonesia qualifies for a FIFA World Cup, they could erase their names from the history books.
MOST CAUTIONS FOR A PLAYER IN A SINGLE WORLD CUP MATCH
Croatia's Josip Simunic holds the record for the most cautions for a player in a single World Cup match.
The referee Graham Poll showed him the yellow card three times (61', 90', 93') before sending him off in the 2006 World Cup match against Australia. The original match report listed all the three yellow cards, before revising it to two, and omitting the 90th-minute yellow card. It is unknown whether this was for maintaining regularity in the reports, or if the caution was retrospectively reversed.
Nonetheless, the onus is on Poll for having Simunic hold this dubious record. When will this record be broken Never.
With advancements in technology, the video official or fourth official would immediately point it to the on-ground referee if such scenario arises. It looks like Simunic will have to live with this record for eternity.-sk

Trump pardons late black boxing champion Jack Johnson
WASHINGTON, Thursday: U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday issued a posthumous pardon to boxer Jack Johnson, the first African-American heavyweight champion, who was jailed a century ago due to his relationship with a white woman.
I believe Jack Johnson is a worthy person to receive a pardon, to correct a wrong in our history, Trump said.
In a case that came to symbolize racial injustice, Johnson was arrested in 1912 with Lucille Cameron, who later became his wife, for violating the Mann Act. The law was passed two years earlier and made it a crime to take a woman across state lines for immoral purposes. Johnson died in 1946.
In signing the pardon, the president cited tremendous racial tension during the time Johnson was champion. He really represented something that was both very beautiful and very terrible at the same time, Trump said.
Actor Sylvester Stallone, famous as the star of the Rocky boxing-movie franchise, and former world heavyweight boxing champion Lennox Lewis flanked Trump for the pardon in the Oval Office. In April, Trump tweeted that he was considering the pardon after talking to Stallone.
Earlier on Thursday, Stallone posted a photo of himself at the White House on Instagram with the caption Waiting for the moment to go into the oval office for the pardon...
In the Oval Office, Trump said of Stallone: I love his movies.
This has been a long time coming, Stallone said, adding that Johnson served as the inspiration for the character of Apollo Creed in the Rocky movies.

## Title: Trump pulls out of North Korea Summit meeting with Kim Jong-un

Trump pulls out of North Korea Summit meeting with Kim Jong-un
President Trump on Thursday pulled out of a highly anticipated summit meeting with Kim Jong-un, accusing the North Koreans of bad faith and lamenting that this missed opportunity is a truly sad moment in history.
The president made his announcement in a remarkably personal, at times mournful-sounding letter to Mr. Kim, North Koreas leader, in which he cited the Norths tremendous anger and open hostility in recent public statements as the specific reason for canceling the meeting.
Mr. Trump said later that the meeting, which had been scheduled for June 12 in Singapore, could still happen, and North Korea issued a strikingly conciliatory response, saying it hoped Mr. Trump would reconsider.
But Mr. Trump also renewed talk of military action against the North and vowed to keep pressing economic sanctions, guaranteeing that for now, at least, his unlikely courtship of Mr. Kim will give way to a more familiar cycle of threats and tension.
The mixed messages were in keeping with a diplomatic gambit that had an air of unreality from the start, when, in early March, Mr. Trump spontaneously accepted Mr. Kims invitation to meet  an acceptance that North Korea did not even publicly acknowledge for several days.
As the date for the meeting drew closer, American and North Korean officials staked out deeply divergent positions on how quickly the North should surrender its nuclear arsenal.
North Korean officials failed to show up for a planning meeting last week in Singapore, snubbing a White House advance team led by the deputy chief of staff, Joe Hagin. The White House, which seemed ill-prepared for a long negotiation, began to have second thoughts. By Thursday, after a North Korean official labeled Vice President Mike Pence a political dummy and threatened a nuclear-to-nuclear showdown, there seemed little rationale for the encounter, beyond Mr. Trumps desire to make history.
I believe that this is a tremendous setback for North Korea and, indeed, for the world, a resigned-sounding president said at a bill-signing ceremony. But he added, If and when Kim Jong-un chooses to engage in constructive dialogue and actions, I am waiting.
They want to do whats right, he said. I really think that they want to do  and it was only recently that this has been taking place.
North Korea appeared to reciprocate, declaring that it was willing to give Mr. Trump the time and opportunity to reconsider his decision.
The unilateral cancellation of the summit was unexpected and very regrettable, said Kim Kye-gwan, a vice Foreign Minister of North Korea. But he said the North remained willing to sit down with the United States any time, in any format, to resolve the problems.
Later Thursday in Washington, Kang Kyung-wha, the South Korean Foreign Minister, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke via telephone and agreed to continue working toward creating the right conditions for the United States and North Korea to talk, South Koreas Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
The statement said that Mr. Pompeo had stressed a willingness to continue dialogue with North Korea.
Nuclear confrontation
Hours before Mr. Trumps announcement, North Korea had blown up an underground nuclear testing site before foreign journalists gathered to witness the demolition. It was the latest in a series of gestures by the North meant to smooth the way for a summit meeting.
In his letter to Mr. Kim, which a senior White House official said the president dictated, Mr. Trump mixed regret with a blunt warning to North Korea that it would lose any nuclear confrontation with the United States. As he so often has with Mr. Kim, Mr. Trump veered between conciliation and belligerence, often in dizzying succession.
You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used, Mr. Trump wrote. But then he added, I felt a wonderful dialogue was building up between you and me, and ultimately it is only that dialogue that matters. Someday, I look very much forward to meeting you.
Abrupt cancellation
While White House officials said a summit meeting with Mr. Kim was still a possibility, keeping the existing date was all but impossible, given the fact that, one senior official said, June 12 is in 10 minutes.
For Mr. Trump, who never tires of extolling his deal-making skills, the abrupt cancellation of the meeting raises questions about how he handled the mercurial North Korean leader. It also creates thorny issues for the administrations efforts to keep the pressure on the North.
South Korea, which was caught off guard by Mr. Trumps decision, may opt to continue its own diplomacy with Mr. Kim, opening a rift with its ally. Mr. Trump did not warn South Koreas President, Moon Jae-in, of his decision, even though the two leaders met in Washington on Tuesday.
China, the linchpin of any sanctions campaign, may relax its pressure on the North, particularly because it was Mr. Trump, not Mr. Kim, who pulled the plug on this effort. Moreover, threats of military action against the North may be harder to justify at a time when Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon are talking about a new era of peace on the Korean Peninsula.
Mr. Trumps reversal drew cries of diplomatic malpractice from Democrats  Senator Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut said it was as discombobulated as everything else in this White Houses foreign policy  and support from Republicans  Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said that they did exactly the right thing.
But the process exposed visible differences in tone between Mr. Trump and the people working for him. While the president continued to speak of the possibility of a meeting, a senior official briefed reporters about the trail of broken promises that led to its cancellation.
Mr. Trumps national security adviser, John R. Bolton, infuriated North Korean officials by proposing the voluntary disarmament of Libya in 2003 as a precedent for North Korea. Under that deal, Libya gave up its entire arsenal without receiving any incentives.
Then, Mr. Pence warned that Mr. Kim could meet the same fate as Libyas leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, if he did not make a deal with the United States. Libyan rebels, aided by a NATO bombing campaign, killed Colonel Qaddafi during the Arab Spring upheavals in 2011. That prompted a North Korean official to call him a political dummy.
Halt nuclear and missile tests
We will neither beg the U.S. for dialogue nor take the trouble to persuade them if they do not want to sit together with us, said Choe Son Hui, a vice Foreign Minister. She asked whether the U.S. will meet us at a meeting room or encounter us at nuclear-to-nuclear showdown.
At the time that Mr. Trump accepted Mr. Kims invitation, several officials said they believed that there was less than a 50 percent chance that the meeting would actually happen. But the president dispatched Mr. Pompeo to work out the logistics for a meeting, and he, too, expressed optimism about the encounter. In addition to blowing up the nuclear site, North Korea pledged to halt nuclear and missile tests, and it released three Korean-Americans imprisoned there  which Mr. Trump acknowledged in the letter was a beautiful gesture.
As recently as Wednesday, the president expressed enthusiasm about meeting Mr. Kim. He said he would be open to a phased denuclearization of North Korea, provided its nuclear programme was rapidly shut down. That is a more flexible position than the Libya model sketched out by Mr. Bolton.
The cancellation creates a crisis for Mr. Moon of South Korea, who said it was disconcerting and very regrettable.
The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and building a permanent peace on the peninsula is a task we cannot give up or delay, he said in a meeting on Thursday with his National Security Council, according to his office.
The decision may also fan tensions between the United States and China. Mr. Trump has said he believes North Koreas tone changed after Mr. Kim met President Xi Jinping of China in the coastal Chinese city of Dalian in early May. Mr. Trump suggested that Mr. Xi might be using Chinas influence over North Korea as leverage in trade negotiations with the United States.
I think Xi told Kim to slow down, said Joseph Y. Yun, who was until recently the State Departments senior diplomat on North Korea. Also, I think Kim was getting pushback from his own folks, as Trump was.
Other experts said the failure was predictable, given the yawning gulf between the two sides.
It was obvious from the presidents tweets that he had not studied the prior negotiations with North Korea, said Michael J. Green, a former Asia adviser to President George W. Bush. If he had spent time with anyone who had done this before, it was clear that North Korea was going for sanctions relief and de facto recognition as a nuclear weapons state.
