Play hard but dont cheat
Cricket Australia's new chairman Earl Eddings has urged his Test side to "play hard but fair" in the series against India, his comments coming at a time when 'elite honesty' has emerged as the buzz word in its setup.
The series starts with the first game in Adelaide on December 6. The players have devised their own cultural pact and, under new coach Justin Langer, are expected to have 'elite honesty'.
"Just play good, hard cricket. I don't think people want us to be quiet but they want us to play with respect to the game, play hard but fair, and win well and lose better," Eddings was quoted as saying by 'Sydney Morning Herald'.
"The old adage is you don't say much when you win and say even less when you lose. I think we have a great team, they are fine young men, and I think they will do that.
"My advice to the guys is to go out and play your natural game and try as hard as you can. That's all Australians want to see," Eddings said.
Eddings got the job after predecessor David Peever was forced to step aside having lost the support of key states NSW and Victoria. His arrival followed the damning Longstaff report into the culture of the governing body, coming after the sandpaper ball-tampering scandal in South Africa when David Warner, Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft were suspended.
Eddings had hoped the Adelaide Test would continue to be staged under lights, but the visitors had reservations.
"Day-night Test cricket is a way of the future. You don't play it in all countries and at all venues. Certainly in Adelaide, you have seen how successful that has been," Eddings said.
"Unfortunately, we couldn't get it done this year but we are going to have one in Brisbane. If you have the right Test at the right spot, day-night Test cricket is fantastic.
Under current International Cricket Council rules, the visiting nation can reject the host nation's request when it comes to scheduling. However, that is set to change under the new Test championship program from next year. - PTI

SPECIAL AIR MISSION 41: Bushs final flights on Air Force One
US: Solemn preparations were underway Sunday for Americas national farewell to George H.W. Bush, whose casket was flown from Texas to Washington aboard President Donald Trumps Presidential aircraft (Air Force One) to lie in state at the start of a days-long state homage.
The 41st President died Friday, aged 94, at his home in Texas -- a very gentle and peaceful passing, his lifelong friend and advisor James Baker said Sunday on ABCs This Week. To commemorate the first former president to die since Gerald Ford in 2006, officials have announced a detailed, four-day schedule of celebratory services and tribute, organized with military precision by the Pentagon task force charged with protecting the US capital.
Its culmination will be a state funeral at Washington National Cathedral on Wednesday, which President Donald Trump -- who had often clashed with the more staid and centrist Bush family -- has declared a national day of mourning.
The weeks events begin yesterday, when Bushs remains are to be flown aboard Air Force One -- made available at Trumps direction -- from Houston to Joint Base Andrews, Maryland.
Bush spokesman Jim McGrath said the Presidential aircrafts flights to carry the 41st American President are being dubbed Special Air Mission 41, as he announced the planes arrival in Houston.
A beautiful day In Texas -- ceiling and visibility unlimited, Mr. President, he wrote, in reference to the aviation code phrase for a desirable situation, one used by Bushs family and friends to spread the news of his death.
Bush is lying in state in the Rotunda of the US Capitol from Monday evening to Wednesday morning, under the watchful gaze of an around-the-clock honors guard. The casket will then be transported to the cathedral for the funeral service -- the fourth there of a former President.
Trump has said he and wife Melania will attend. Dozens of foreign leaders and US luminaries are expected. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney told Politico he will deliver one of several eulogies at the service, at Bushs request.
Former US First Lady Michelle Obama said she was canceling book tour visits to Paris and Berlin to attend the important funeral and honour Bushs tremendous contributions to our world. The casket will then be flown back on the Presidential plane to Houston, where the former President will lie in repose at St Martins Episcopal Church -- where the Bushes worshiped for decades -- until a funeral service on Thursday.
The remains will then be transported by train for interment on the grounds of the George Bush Presidential Library in College Station, Texas. Bush will be buried next to his wife Barbara, who died in April, and their daughter Robin, who died of leukemia aged three.
James Baker, who served as Bush as Secretary of State, joined others in paying warm tribute on Sunday television talk shows.
Baker called him far and away the best one-term President we have ever had, alluding to Bushs single biggest political failure -- his loss in the 1992 election to then-governor Bill Clinton.
Colin Powell, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during that war, said he was confident in Bushs leadership because, as a World War II veteran, he knew what combat was all about. He knew it meant the death of people... He wanted to avoid a war.
Baker was a young lawyer in Houston grieving his wifes untimely death when Bush, his tennis partner, persuaded him to try something new: help Bush run for office.
That partnership eventually took Baker to a career as Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury -- and Bush to the White House. Baker saw his friend several times in his final days.
The former President had struggled for years with Parkinsons disease, which left him wheelchair-bound and often hospitalized -- including after Barbaras death. After each time he would bounce back, Baker said on ABC.
But by Friday, he began to go downhill... He hadnt eaten for three or four days. Still, when an aide told Bush his friend was visiting that day, he perked up. He opened his eyes. He looked at me, he says, Hey, Bake. Where we going Were going to heaven, Baker said. Bush replied: Good, thats where I want to go. - AFP

Writ of Quo Warranto against mahinda and others
APPEAL COURT ISSUES INTERIM ORDER
In the case at hand before this Court, the 122 Petitioner members of the 225 Member Parliament state that a No-Confidence Motion was passed by a majority in the said Parliament.
The Petitioners allege that the Respondents have usurped the public office namely the respective positions in the office of Prime Minister, Cabinet of Ministers and other Ministers.
This Court has considered the submissions made by the learned Presidents Counsel for the Respondents who stated that the granting of interim relief by this Court would result in a situation where the Country would have no Prime Minister, no Cabinet of Ministers as well as no other Ministers.
On the other hand, this Court has considered the submission of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners who stated that a great damage would be caused if this Court alter the argument of the case accepts what the 122 Petitioner members of the Parliament have asserted in this case, and concludes that the Respondents are not entitled in law to function in the respective public offices. In such an event, the Respondents would be mere usurpers of office of the Prime Minister, Cabinet of Ministers and the other Ministers.
This Court is mindful that wide powers of governance of the Country are vested with the Prime Minister, Cabinet of Ministers and the other Ministers by virtue of various provisions of the Constitution as well as other laws.
Thus, whoever holding such office is required to make important decisions which will affect the whole country at large both locally and internationally. Most of such decisions may not be reversible.
This Court is also mindful of the damage that would be caused if this Court having granted interim relief to restrain the Respondents from functioning in their public offices and then proceed to subsequently dismiss this application refusing to issue the remedies prayed for by the Petitioners.
However, the Court observes as per the prayers pertaining to the interim relief in the petition, what the Petitioners have requested this Court to restrain is not the functioning of the Prime Minister or the Cabinet of Ministers or any other Minister but to restrain the Respondents from functioning in those offices. Thus, the Court observes that the interim orders prayed for, are directed against the individual respondents to restrain them from functioning in the relevant public offices. The question as to who should he appointed to function in the said offices if this Court restrains the Respondents from functioning in the relevant offices is not a matter for this Court but for those who are vested with such powers in terms of the Constitution.
Moreover, if what the 122 Petitioner Members of Parliament have asserted in this case is found to be correct, then the present prevailing situation of the country would be a situation where the Country would have no Prime Minister, no Cabinet of Ministers as well as no other Ministers. In such an event, the granting of interim relief would not create any fresh situation than that is prevailing.
Thus, the balance of convenience of the parties to this case is tilted in favour of the case advanced by the 122 Petitioners.
Another question one should ask at this moment is whether an irreparable or irremediable damage would be caused by not restraining the Respondents from functioning in the respective public offices. This Court is of the view that it should answer this question in the affirmative.
Further, it is the view of this Court that the damage that may be caused by temporarily restraining a lawful Cabinet of Ministers from functioning would in all probabilities be outweighed by the damage that would be caused by allowing a set of persons who are not entitled in law to function as the Prime Minister or the Cabinet of Ministers or any other Minister of the Government.
The magnitude of the latter damage would be very high. Such damage would be an irreparable or irremediable one. Such damage would also have far reaching consequences to the whole country. In such a situation a final order could be rendered nugatory even if the petitioners are successful.
For the foregoing reasons, this Court decides to grant
1) An interim order restraining the 1st Respondent from functioning as Prime Minister and/or Minister of the Cabinet of Ministers until the final hearing and determination of this application;
2) an interim order restraining the 2nd to 29th Respondents from functioning as Ministers who are Members of the Cabinet of Ministers until the final hearing and determination of this application;
3) an interim order restraining the 39th to 41st Respondents from functioning as Ministers who are not members of the Cabinet of Ministers until the final hearing and determination of this application;
4) an interim order restraining the 42nd to 49th Respondents from functioning as Deputy Ministers until the final hearing and determination of this application.
This Court would take all possible measures to dispose this application as soon as possible and thus would set appropriate time limits for the parties to take other necessary steps to enable this Court to fix this case for argument and then to pronounce the judgment.

Australian batsman hits six sixes in over at U-19 Championships
A young Australian batsman has hit six sixes in over during a record-breaking double century at the Cricket Australia Under 19 Male National Championships in Adelaide.
Ollie Davies, the New South Wales Metro captain who plays for Manly-Warringah CC in Sydney, smashed 207 off 115 balls in a total of 4 for 406. It was the first double hundred scored in the U-19 one-day male championships and the first in the championships overall since Jason Krejza in 2001-02.
It was in the 40th over of the innings that Davies completed his full set of sixes during a stay that included 17 in total. His second century needed just 39 balls.
I was looking to hit the good balls for one and then anything loose was looking to pounce on and take over the fence, Davies said. After the first two sixes I had in the back of my head that I wanted to give it a crack and it paid off at the end. I was just trying to target forward of square and cow corner, getting down on the back leg before it was even bowled and trying to slog sweep.

BCCI invites applications for new womens team coach
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Friday invited application for the position of the head coach of the national women's cricket team as the term of the current coach, Ramesh Powar, expired on Saturday.
"The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) would like to call upon interested candidates to apply for the position of 'Head Coach - Team India (Senior Women)," an official BCCI statement read.
The development comes at a time when the tussle between senior player Mithali Raj and Ramesh is at its peak. Recently, Mithali Raj, in a fiery letter to BCCI, had alleged coach Powar of "discriminatory" treatment. She had accused him of "humiliating" her and treating her partially.
Raj's omission from the Indian team for their semi-final clash against England in the recently-concluded Women's World T20 had also triggered a controversy prompting Powar to mention the reason behind dropping the ODI skipper from the crucial match in a detailed team performance report to BCCI.
In his defence, Powar stated that Raj used to give "minimum inputs in the team meeting" and that she never uttered a "single word of appreciation" after the team finished on top of the table. He also accused her of putting individual interests above than that of the team.
BCCI will be receiving the applications for the position of the head coach of the women's team on December 14. ANI

Bhosle was the first rapper!
Rendering the female vocals of the track Dil Sarphira, along with an array of male singers who are way younger than her, Asha Bhosle's ebullient voice seems in no way, out of place. If anything, it could evidently be the highlight of the romance number, that was launched only last week. As futile as it may be to point out, Bhosle's playful voice is always instantly identifiable.
She laments, this ability of making an identity with their voice is missing in the current crop of singers. "There is neither much talent, nor a strong voice. The way people could hear a song and say, 'Oh, this is Lata [Mangeshkar],' they can't do that anymore," says the veteran. Even though she says she isn't particularly clued into the offerings of the younger lot, that they bank on numbers that have been rendered in the past, hasn't gone unnoticed. "New artistes are rendering old songs, while girls are only being encouraged to sing in low [keys]. The rhythms are also similar. Koi zabardast melody aani chahiye."
Point out that the industry has been celebrating the works of rappers of late, and Bhosle is quick to point out that rapping is, in fact, "spoken-word". "It's not a song," she says, quick to add, "I was the first to rap. What else would you say were songs like Mera Naam Hain Shabnam or Hungama Today's English raps which employ foul language, are not favourable." In an industry that's as commercially inclined as Bollywood, Bhosle cues us on how veterans like her teach their children to keep the love for the craft alive. "Classical music should be taught. My granddaughter is learning Indian and Western music. She hasn't lost sight of our culture."

Bond scam artistes trying their best to keep Parliament going - Prasanna
The persons who received the money robbed from the Central Bank through the Bond scam are now trying their best to keep the current Parliament, MP Prasanna Ranatunga said.
Addressing a press conference at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Head Quarters in Battaramulla yesterday, he said it was the UNP which said that the JVP took money from them. Now the UNP leader is trying to buy UPFA MPs.
There is no supremacy in the 225 Members in Parliament and it lies with the people of this country. The entire country is demanding a
General Election and a petition is being signed by them. Holding a General Election is the only solution to the current situation, Ranatunga said.
According to MP Ranatunga, the main objective of the Opposition is creating an environment similar to Libya in Sri Lanka and bringing in a leader who is loved by the West.
The funds are being pumped by foreign countries and certain local companies. The TNA is trying to get Eelam through Parliament while the LTTE failed to get it through arms.
In 2005 the former President and current Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa took over a country that was devastated by a huge Tsunami, a country with a brutal war and a country in the throes of a food shortage etc.
Then he handed over a financially stable and peaceful country in 2015. Again in 2018, he has received a country with an economic crisis created through the Central Bank Bond issue, violence in the North and the East, a strong under world, a widespread illicit drug business etc.

Call for snap poll
Professionals, religious leaders and civil society activists representing 28 organisations yesterday stressed the importance of holding a snap election soon to solve current political instability.
They said that holding a snap poll is the only way to solve the present instability in the country.
Former Chief Justice Sarath N.Silva yesterday said that the country is in an unprecedented crisis situation and holding a snap election is the only way out this. The former CJ said that Only President has the power to dissolve Parliament and no one else has that power.
He added that President Maithripala Sirisena issued a proclamation dissolving Parliament and the Supreme Court stayed the proclamation after considering FR petitions that sought an order to nullify the proclamation, he said.
On the other hand holding of an election to elect a fresh parliament has also stayed. The Court of Appeal has also stayed the Cabinet of Ministers, he said.
Silva added that there should be a solution for this crisis and the country cannot go forward without a stable government.
Former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe may want to continue this instability without going for an election. But we dont want. We want to have a stable country by electing a fresh parliament, he said.
He added that no one will benefit,if instability reigns in the country. The country has never witnessed instability as today since the introduction of universal franchise. We should be thankful to the people of all communities for exercising restraint, he said.
The former Chief Justice added that the Constitution of the country is the supreme law of the land which has given a pride of place for peoples soverenity.
The peoples right to elect the representatives of their choice by way of an election has been denied and this is a tragedy, he said. Silva added that every institution in the country should be dedicated to protect and promote the peoples sovereignty. The people will elect representatives of their choice to Parliament at an election. The countrys economy may collapse if the present instability continues, he said.
The former Chief Justice asked as to why the United National Party and its leader Ranil Wickremesinghe show hesitation for an election.

Chris Gayle wins Australia masseuse defamation payout
Sydney, Monday: West Indies cricket star Chris Gayle Monday won a Aus$300,000 (US$221,000) payout from an Australian media group which claimed he exposed his genitals to a massage therapist.
The all-rounder was accused by Fairfax Media, publisher of The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, in a series of stories in the newspapers in 2016.
They alleged he exposed his penis and indecently propositioned the woman in a dressing room at the 2015 World Cup in Sydney.
Gayle strenuously denied the allegations, claiming at the time that the journalists behind the story wanted to destroy him.
His teammate Dwayne Smith, who was in the changing room at the time, also denied the incident took place. He won his defamation case in October last year, with jurors finding Fairfax was motivated by malice and had failed to establish a defence of truth.
New South Wales Supreme Court Justice Lucy McCallum said in awarding the payout that being accused of such conduct was very damaging to Mr Gayles reputation, according to a report in Fairfax newspapers.
She added that Gayles evidence on hurt to his feelings was surprisingly compelling.
Fairfax said it planned to lodge an immediate appeal.
The publication of the stories followed an uproar after Gayle attempted to flirt with an Australian presenter on live TV, asking her out for a drink and telling her: Dont blush, baby.
After winning the court case, Gayle tried to spark a bidding war for a tell-all interview on the case, promising that when I break this down to yall it will be like a movie.
Biding (sic) starts at US$300K for this interview! So much to say & I will! he tweeted to his then 3.75 million followers.
There were no takers. AFP

CIPM Concludes Advanced MDP for RDB
CIPM Sri Lanka, the Nations leader in Human Resource Management, successfully concluded the customized Management Development Programme for Senior Chief Managers of the Regional Development Bank (RDB) recently.
The MDP was customized for the specific requirements of RDB in line with the objective of building skills, attitudes and competencies required to attain the growth and expansion plans of the apex development bank over the next 5-10 years.
CIPM Sri Lankas panel of experienced and expert facilitators in human resource management and other business disciplines led by U. A. C. Obeyesekere-Past President, CIPM Sri Lanka and Lead academic facilitator for the Advanced MDP analyzed the core competencies and skills required by the Bank based on their strategic plan and developed a detailed customized MDP to fill the gaps that were identified.
We would like to thank the experienced team of facilitators from CIPM Sri Lanka who worked closely with our team to finalize the custom MDP which was fully tailored to meet the Banks unique needs. Their ability to draw upon a wide base of facilitators and trainers with specific knowledge and industry experience in areas which are important to a growing development bank is one of the key comfort factors that we received from CIPM Sri Lanka said General Manager/Chief Executive Officer of RDB - T. A. Ariyapala, Regional Development Bank.
The MDP was held over 8 fortnightly Saturdays covering 4 months at Miloda, Academy of Financial Studies in Colombo 01 in which 45 Senior Bankers of RDB were trained and skills upgraded in an interactive manner utilizing a combination of classroom lectures, discussions, videos, practical individual and group assignments, presentations and case studies.
We are delighted that CIPM Sri Lanka was able to successfully deliver the customized MDP for RDB which is one of the foremost development banks in the country providing yeoman service to the development objectives of the country said Dhammika Fernando  President, CIPM Sri Lanka.
A customized MDP rather than a General Programme for management development is appropriate in order to rapidly enhance and develop the skills, attitudes and competencies necessary to achieve a specific strategic plan. Our consultancy team which functions under the Consultancy, Research and Corporate Training Division has the capacity to develop similar MDPs and consultancy programmes for any organization, public or private, in any industry he added.
CIPM was founded in 1959 and was subsequently incorporated by an Act of Parliament in 1976 and comprises of over 1200 Professional Members who serve in both public and private organizations.

CSR effort combines donations with disaster prepareness
The Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Bank (MUFG) conducted its annual CSR initiative last month, utilising the platform built by the Asia Pacific Alliance for Disaster Management (A-PAD) Sri Lanka. The initiative saw a group of 50 children from low-income households in the Dodangoda district receive educational packs containing exercise books, stationery, school shoes, and a school bag. Since MUFG has been actively supporting and engaging with communities for 2013, it formed a partnership with A-PAD Sri Lanka during the 2016 floods which affected the Kalutara district, providing much-needed relief to those affected.
MUFG General Manager Tatsuo Matsushita said, It is a privilege to donate school stationery to the children and we were rewarded with their smiling faces. Through our annual MUFG Gives Back global community outreach programme, we hope we can motivate young learners to continue their quest for knowledge, while overcoming difficulties along the way.
A-PAD Sri Lanka said it was grateful to MUFG Resident Representative Masaru Enamoto, HR Associate Dulini Ratnayake, Chalini Jayathilake, and Matsushita for their assistance in the project.
A quiz was conducted on the economics of saving, turning the initiative into a fun, entertaining, and informative event with A-PAD Sri Lanka additionally engaging with the group which included parents, by giving a presentation on possible disasters and the preventative and safety measures that can be taken.
A-PAD Sri Lanka also said it was grateful to Dodangoda District Secretary U. D. C. Jayalal, the Kalutara Government Agent and Dodangoda Additional District Secretary K. T. S. Deraratne for providing their full support in helping with the coordination efforts of the initiative.
The Kalutara district is categorised as a zone that is prone to flooding, as evidenced by the floods which decimated the region in 2016. Creating awareness of the methods and actions that can be taken during such disasters will mitigate the effects of any future disaster.
A-PAD continually associates with CSR initiatives and events hosted by corporate companies to include presentations, public forums, and dissemination of informative materials that create awareness to reduce the risk to persons and communities, thereby enhancing their adaptation and resilience to disasters.
The overall success of the initiative by MUFG, steered by the experience of A-PAD Sri Lanka, highlights the potential that can be achieved by private enterprises in their efforts to provide relief and aid to those affected by disasters.
The Asia Pacific Alliance for Disaster Management holds offices in six countries across the region, including Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Korea, and Sri Lanka. The alliance continually coordinates disaster preparedness, carries out disaster mitigation, and conducts disaster risk reduction activities to ensure that minimal loss of life occurs during disasters and that the right resources are deployed to those in need, using optimal channels.
With the MUFG and A-PAD both being Japan-based organisations, a strong bond was formed that would help ensure that the people on the ground are not left behind and are given the relief they need to get back on their feet.
A-PAD Sri Lanka Country Director Firzan Hashim said, Our goal is to help identify the needs of the areas affected and get them the right resources that they require with the support of the private sector who want to help, at the right time, through the A-PAD connection. One such effort was MUFG providing for the students in the Dodangoda district, who were grateful for the assistance given.

Deaf and Disabled cricket comes under aegis of SLC
Sri Lanka Deaf and Disable Cricket were recognized by the Minister of Sports Faiszer Mustapha who wanted both sports bodies to be affiliated to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC). He made this remark at the press conference held at SLC premises yesterday.
Minister Mustapha further said that equal rights should be given to these sports not only in cricket but also other disabled sports to help them develop their skills.
Disabled and deaf athletes also look for equal opportunities and rights not sympathies. We must look into this to ensure their rights too, said the Minister.
Today onward these sports will be affiliated to the SLC and they dont need to worry about their sponsors in the future. They will get equal facilities like able cricketers, he said.
Sri Lankan deaf cricketers created history when they beat India by 36 runs to win the Deaf ICC T-20 cricket world cup played at the Teri Gram Cricket grounds in Gurgaon, India on December 1. This is the first time Sri Lanka deaf cricketers had achieved such a milestone.
During the pre-tournament the Sri Lanka Deaf Cricket Association suffered with lack of financial support and on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena, the Sports Minister directed Sri Lanka Cricket to sponsored the team for the tournament.
All the players, coaches and officials were awarded with 500 USD cash prize given by Sri Lanka Cricket.
Sri Lanka Captain Dinesh Chandimal and Roshen Silva also graced the occasion.
Chandimal said this was a proud moment for Sri Lanka cricket after winning the world cup in 1996 and the world T20 in 2014 for the deaf cricketers to win the world cup.
SLC Competent Authority Kamal Pathmasiri, director general of sports Dhammika Muthugala and SLC CEO Ashley de Silva were also present at the occasion.

Disabled benefited only by a fraction of funds allocated to them - DOJF
According to the Disability Organizations Joint Front (DOJF), the government allocated Rs.28 billion per year for the welfare of the disabled but only a fraction of it truly benefit the disabled.
DOJF Advisor Prasanna Kuruppu addressing a media conference to mark the International Day of Disabled Persons yesterday explained that even the allowance of Rs.3,000 per month paid to disabled persons only came up to Rs.1.5 billion per year and thus they were not aware of what happened to the rest of the money.
The Front represented by 30 organizations covering physical and intellectual disabilities has been campaigning for equal opportunities in the field of education, health care, public services, politics, cultural rights, access to public buildings, employment, social security and the legal framework which does not accommodate the disabled.
Even the Right to Information Act does not have a mechanism to allow a person who is blind or deaf to submit an application, said DOJF President Sugath Wasantha De Silva.
According to the Department of Census and Statistics, there are close to 8.7 percent or 1.7 million who are considered disabled in the country. The majority of them, at 57 percent are women.
They are burdened with the twin challenges of their gender as well as their disability, said Rasanjali Pathirage, DOJF General Secretary. Many she explained are cut off from public life, have no access to education or employment. Further even if harassed or abused at home, have no way of accessing the authorities to find justice.
Close to 54 percent of disabled persons in the school going age do not have access to education and 71 percent do not engage in any economic activity.
One of the Fronts main demands is that the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act No 28 of 1996 be amended to encompass a wide array of issues faced by the community. In 2003, they had submitted a national policy covering 22 areas and in 2006 a draft new Act was prepared. Kuruppu explained that whilst Cabinet approval was granted for it and the Attorney Generals Department,Social Welfare Ministry and the Legal Draftsman Department took it up in 2008, it has never progressed beyond that.
The Government thinks they would have to bear a heavy cost in implementing it, but we see it as an investment not cost.
The Fronts Draft Act more importantly asked for two important mechanisms to be set up; one an agency to coordinate all government services to the disabled and another to monitor and regulate all assistive devices used by the disabled to ensure they are up to standard.

Dont be explicit just say Oochikapips!
I explained in a recent journalism lecture last week how euphemisms are usually employed to avoid saying anything controversial or indiscreet and can be really witty and out-and-out comical at times. From classic literature to movies and from boardrooms to drawing rooms, euphemisms are extensively used everywhere when talking about politics, sex, violence, or any other topics that are deemed as taboo or inappropriate in civil society.
Whats more, euphemisms can make your dialogues more poetic, add a certain amount of sophistication to them and make them sound more proper and right. Euphemisms are an easy way to express oneself in a nice way without hurting or shocking anyone. It helps people master the skills of polite conversation better. Today you dont call a person who had over-imbibed a drunken sot. A drunkard will be described as convivial or cheery.
Unbearably garrulous is sociable or the dread ebullient. Lively wit means a penchant for telling cruel and unfunny stories. Austere and reserved mean joyless and depressed. Someone with a foul temper did not suffer fools gladly. Uncontrollable appetites of all sorts such as indulged in by most of our politicos and their sycophants may earn the ultimate accolade: They lived life to the full. Such euphemisms are a pleasant echo of an age when private lives enjoyed a degree of protective discretion that now seems unimaginable in Sri Lanka.
That left room for a confirmed bachelor - a homosexual - or someone burdened by occasional irregularities in his private life the benefit of the doubt. It left the reader guessing whether the problem was indecent exposure, adultery or cross-dressing. Besides the homosexual label is now taboo and a polite expression would be Batting for the other side. All right now, the proper word for second-hand such as a used car now is pre-owned.
Yes certainly pre-owned is a polite way of placing more value on an object and making its present owner more comfortable. But dont ever dare to be so crass as to apply the term to a divorce, a widow or a woman separated from her husband. Now that would be what is referred to as a dysphemism the opposite of euphemism.
The ultimate dysphemism was spewed out regularly by an obnoxious newsman nicknamed The Duke. He could not resist yelling rudely whenever a mature grand dame passed by his desk with: Panchikawatte, Parana Badu! He was nicely put in his place by one of the more fiery dragon ladies who fired back: Naaki hujjakkuwata no start other than a crank start. She alluded to him as a vintage rattle-trap who needed a crank start.
When old goes with wine, we think good vintage. With furniture, we think antiques, and might even smell the polish. With painting, we think of the great Masters. When old goes with money, we think upper-crust establishment and the aristocracy. But when old goes with a person were on different terrain. Yes the word old does seem to have negative connotations.
Weve arrived in the use-by-date domain. Just as the young and the neware valued for having spent less time on the planet, so the not young and the not new are devalued. Its a short step from devalued to demeaned. Meanwhile, the caption alongside a new beauty product  Age Less - feels less like a noun or adjective than an imperative verb.
No, no one ages these days in the geriatric sense. Many of us may be elders and referred to as elderly, but there are no oldsters. And heaven forbid if you use some of the more disrespectfully offensive terms such as old fogies, geezers, crones, grumpies, antiques or senile, decrepit and fossils. No none of those nasty terms should be in usage unless you want a smack on the kisser by some of the more feisty Recycled Teenagers as we call ourselves.
The term veteran is not a bad one. And whats wrong in labelling the grander-ones among us as Silver Surfers, Golden Agers and Goldies. Still, its not all bad news. Agatha Christie once said she loved being married to an archaeologist. As she got older, he appreciated her more.
But euphemisms can also be benign, even necessary. Sometimes the need to prevent hurt feelings justifiably takes precedence over clarity. For instance all living monuments to adulterous relationships are not called illegitimate or B******s. They are termed Offspring on the wrong side of the blanket.
Politically correct euphemisms are among the most pernicious. Good and bad become appropriate or inappropriate.
A ghastly problem such as a constitutional crisis becomes a less alarming challenging issue. No, no politicians the world over are all Honourable men and they never lie. They are simply, economical with the truth.
Of course my favourite area for euphemisms deals with that ever popular recreation that is a combination of procreation and sensation that has led to the foundation of the human race. Yes, in a culture that still has trouble dealing with this topic, euphemisms abound. Just look at some of the ways we can talk about having intercourse. The more polite terms for it range from: The birds and the bees, Acting like rabbits, Making love to, Getting it on, Hanky panky, Cheeky time, or Making Whoopee.
Thanks to some people it is frowned upon in company to even say you are going to the toilet. The most common is going to the loo. People also use such expressions as taking a pit stop, test the plumbing, spend a penny, Sprinkle tinkle and I love the one women use I am going to powder my nose. After all, euphemisms are unpleasant truths wearing diplomatic cologne.
All right then but why do we anglicized Sri Lankans favour the American and British terms for even a simple act as going to the bathroom. When my parents berated me for openly saying I want to pee-pee or some such crude term in company when I was six, I decided to coin a term for it.
It is a euphemism even the grandkids use today and given by the familys disparate global locations will soon find its way into the Oxford Dictionary. Okay all you Sri Lankans take my cue while heading for the toilet: Dont be explicit, just say Oochikapips!

Enhanced rail passenger and freight services
The Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry has placed an order for new passenger compartments, fuel carriages and flatbeds to enhance railway passenger and freight services, MP Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
He said a number of changes and developments will be taking place within the countrys railway service during the next two years to cater to the passengers needs.
The MP was speaking at the Colombo Port last morning while participating at the official ceremony to unload the first consignment of train units imported from India after five years. A diesel-electric locomotive engine and a power-set with nine compartments and two engines arrived under the first consignment. The power-set worth Rs. 1.8 billion and the locomotive engine worth Rs.77.8 million were brought to the island under the Indian Concessionary Loan Scheme.
The power-sets comprised five third (economy) class compartments, two second class compartments and two air-conditioned (first class) compartments. The Transport Ministry will spend Rs.18 billion to import 10 power-sets and the six engines. According to Railway Department sources, the power-sets will be used for long-distance services while the locomotive engines will be used for main line services. The MP said that it is also expected to import trains suitable for the upcountry line which would help boost the tourism industry. The number of office train services is also expected to increase with the addition of these new trains, he added.

European Aviation Safety Agency approves SriLankan Engineering
The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has approved SriLankan Engineering to carry out Base Maintenance operations on Airbus A330 aircraft as per EASA Part-145 regulations. SriLankan Engineering is the aircraft Maintenance-Repair-Overhaul (MRO) arm of SriLankan Airlines, the national carrier of Sri Lanka.
This certification completes the requirements for SriLankan Engineering to conduct base maintenance operations on the A320, A321 and A330 families of aircraft of all airlines operating to Colombos Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA).
This includes the entire SriLankan Airlines fleet, which is comprised of A320, A321 and A330 aircraft. Earlier this year, EASA certified SriLankan Engineering as an MRO approved for EASA Part-145 Base Maintenance operations for Airbus A320 aircraft. EASA is the aviation regulatory arm of the European Union with authority over airline industry matters, and maintains the highest global standards for airlines to comply with.
Vipula Gunatilleka, Group Chief Executive Officer of SriLankan Airlines, said:
SriLankan Engineering is an important department of our airline and this new certification will undoubtedly enhance its capabilities and ability to contribute more actively to the bottom-line of the company.
D.A.G.Jayasuriya, Chief Technical Officer of SriLankan Airlines, said: SriLankan Engineering has undergone a considerable transformation over the past two years to enhance and upgrade its facilities, organizational structure, and professional capabilities. We possessed these certifications for many years, but took a decision to voluntarily suspend the certifications while we carried out our upgrading programme, as it required the full attention of our staff and involved construction activities in some of our hangar facilities that restricted their availability for aircraft related work.
A team of auditors from EASA monitored the enhancements and carried out a fullaudit prior to reinstating the certifications.During the period of upgrading, SriLankan continued to hold all necessary certifications of the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL), which is the licensing authority for SriLankans own fleet.
SriLankan also possesses EASA certifications for its Line Maintenance and Engineering Workshops, including type certification of aircraftoperated andEASA certified Part 147 Training.
The enhancements included enlargement of the floor area in SriLankan Engineerings Main Hangar to allow more aircraft to be served simultaneously; and enclosing of the Main Hangar with the installation of a new hangar door. Similar enhancements were completed earlier this year on SriLankan Engineerings smaller hangar that is dedicated for A320 aircraft.

Fists of FURY
Los Angeles, Sunday: Deontay Wilder still hopes to face Anthony Joshua in a heavyweight unification bout but is happy to hand rival Tyson Fury a rematch following their epic draw.
Wilder retained his WBC heavyweight title belt on Saturday after a thrilling 12-round battle ended in a split decision draw at the Staples Center.
The result means Wilder is still in a position to achieve his dream of unifying the heavyweight division against Fury's fellow Briton, Joshua, who holds the WBA, IBF and WBO versions of the title.
But Saturday's thriller in Los Angeles, and the inconclusive result, means that Wilder may have to wait before climbing into a ring with Joshua. The clamour for a rematch with Fury may well prove to be irresistible.
Asked which fight Wilder would prefer -- Joshua or Fury -- the 33-year-old replied: "I would love to go for the other titles."
"I've always spoken that there should be one champion, one face, one name. I always wanted to unify the division," Wilder said.
"I'll be satisfied with (either Fury or Joshua), to be honest. Me and Fury put on a hell of a performance. I'd love to go back to a rematch or I'd love to fight Joshua. I'm in a win-win situation."
Wilder's handlers however are adamant that they believe a return with Fury, who came back from a devastating 12th round knockdown to hold on for a draw, is the more attractive fight.
"I believe the fight with Tyson Fury is the stronger fight," said co-manager Shelly Finkel. "Probably more logical to have that. He dropped the guy twice.
"Deontay will fight anyone. Deontay knows he would be better in the next fight. I don't think Fury can be better."
Wilder's promoter Lou DiBella agreed that the Fury rematch should take priority, making the case that Wilder and Fury are the two best heavyweights in the division.
"This fight has energised the division," DiBella said. "We've got an American heavyweight champion that Americans can be proud of. And there's two guys in Great Britain that are great champions.
"I'm not denigrating anybody but I think the two guys tonight would beat the third guy (Joshua)."
Fury's veteran promoter Frank Warren is also keen for a rematch, calling for an open-air duel in Britain sometime in 2019.
"It has to be down to Tyson, but from my perspective, I'd love the rematch," Warren said. "Let's go and fill up a football stadium. We want the fight.
"Irrespective of who won, it's one of those fights you want to see it again."
Lucrative fight
Fury, who many observers thought was unlucky not to be handed the decision despite two knockdowns, said he was ready to face Wilder again.
"I'm happy for the fight," Fury said. "We didn't get the result we wanted. I'm going to go home and enjoy Christmas and sit down with my team and recalculate."
Any rematch between Wilder and Fury is guaranteed to be the most lucrative fight of their career to date.
After years in the doldrums, boxing's heavyweight division has a box-office appeal that it has lacked since era of Lennox Lewis, Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield in the late 1990s.
"As the old saying goes: As the heavyweight division goes, so goes boxing," said DiBella.
"Well the future of boxing is brighter because the heavyweight division right now is so vibrant."
Fury's astonishing recovery in the 12th round, when he somehow managed to recover his senses after being sent crashing to the canvas by a vicious Wilder combination, explain the division's appeal.
How Fury was able to recover drew an awed response from anyone who witnessed.
Wilder believed he had knocked Fury out. DiBella and Finkel admitted they had already started climbing towards the ring in expectation the fight was over. AFP

GM to slash jobs and close eight plants
General Motors (GM) plans to halt production at five factories in North America and cut more than 14,000 jobs.
The US carmaker has also announced it will close three plants outside North America by the end of 2019.
The moves follow rising costs and slower car sales and come as the firm focuses on its line-up of trucks, electric and self-driving vehicles.
But the restructuring drew swift criticism from politicians, including President Donald Trump.
I am not happy about it, he said of the plans, which undercut his claims that his policies are spurring a revival in the US auto industry. BBC

Incredible bird-shaped fountain
In the heart of Kazakhstans capital lays Presidential Park, a massive public area that stretches out in front of the Ak Orda Presidential Palace. This unique landscape and architecture is part of Astanas rebirth as the capital of the former Soviet country. Spilling over nearly 60 acres, the green oasis sits within the city, filled with eye-catching symbolism.
Central to the design of this spectacular open space is a unique fountain that takes on the appearance of a bird, when viewed from above. In reality, its not just any bird, but the Samruka mythical creature that symbolizes life and freedom. Each morning the fountain is dry, its granite basins forming a pedestrian square. Throughout the day, jets in the basin fill the bird with water that later cascades away like a river.
The Samruk fountain leads organically to another centerpiece of Presidential Parkthe Palace of Peace and Reconciliation. After opening in 2006, the 252-foot-tall pyramid has become a top event venue and cultural attraction in the city. The building was designed by British architect Norman Foster of Foster + Partners, who is also responsible for Londons famous Gherkin.

Infectious rhythms
Music is Cathartic to me. It is my drug of choice. It alleviates stress and helps me decompress, said Part Musician Part Businessman, Vidhu Jayawardene. Melodies feature this young man who is using this excellent, powerful and infectious drug to spread inspiration and positivity throughout society.
Catharsis is generally understood as the process of releasing, and thereby providing relief from, strong or repressed emotions. One is also made to understand that creative and intense individuals throughout the world need this process of release because they have so much energy and intensity of emotions within them. Music is the ultimate release. Music can be destructive and positive depending on who is singing it. Musicians and writers generally have a lot of soul. They are the two most similar types of people in this world.
Jayawardene is a man who has experienced no in life. But for him no means  next opportunity. He says one of the most significant milestones in his life is getting kicked out of the Preliminary Round in TNL Onstage 2007. But this made him more determined and took him to the next stage of his life.
I compose and produce music while running Ripples a Digital and Social Media Marketing Agency. Getting kicked out of the Preliminary Round in TNL Onstage 2007 and becoming Music Consultant for TNL onstage in 2009 was one important event. The others were ranking 43rd at the Global Rockstar Competition 2014, performing at the Hard Rock Caf Pune at the RollingStone Magazine Awards 2010 and collaborating with talented international artists, said Jayawardene.
Jayawardene states that finding the right instruments, melodies and mixing to bring out the essence of that particular song/emotion are some of the things that make him passionate about music.
I have done two tours in India and Dubai and the most memorable one was India  The Rollingstone Magazine Awards Tour 2010 and it is great to know that our neighbors who are Indian were big fans of the music and the response was really great. Some of the most outstanding and memorable memories I have, are of my band Breathspace where we put out six singles and two covers. I myself have put out four singles. Special to me is Save Me. I had recorded 42 different versions of this song before finally arriving at the right one. Another memorable one was my cover of Ex Alien. I wanted people to think about what the original artist was trying to convey through her music and not slander a teenage girl for her attempt, explained Jayawardene.
Jayawardene says his choice of music is rock which is modern alternative. He does quite a few cover versions and it is no artist in particular that he is into, just anything that inspires him. He is currently in the process of releasing a few covers over the next few weeks.
From the artistes I admire locally and internationally, internationally would be Katatonia, Breaking Benjamin, Tool, Revis and the Cranberries. I like them because they stay true to themselves and their music is just an extension of who they are. I strongly feel that to succeed in music you need to be someone that believes you need to be a student always, because life is a continuous learning process. My message to anyone who wants to be a full time musician is find a mentor, establish clear goals and invest in yourself, pointed out Jayawardene.
Jayawardene has many people he would like to thank in life. First and foremost is his family. Then there is Menik Neydorff for teaching him how to play the guitar. And last but not least his fans and friends. And there is also Breathspace, his first band before he flew solo. When it comes to inspiration his greatest inspiration is the Truth. Rational and emotional truths. That is where he gets his inspiration to write lyrics.
I have released 4 singles so far  Save me, Miles Away (feat. Sheam Deen), CPR and I am your freedom (feat. Lucrezia Losurdo). I have not put out any albums, only studio singles. The Indian tour was with the band. I also did a private gig in Dubai. Each song of mine has its own essence that meant something to me. In terms of production composition I would say CPR was one such song because of the right blend of vocals, guitars and soundscapes, added Jayawardene.

## Title: JUDICIARY AND REMEDIES IN PUBLIC LAW
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Tuesday, December 4, 2018 - 01:00
JUDICIARY AND REMEDIES IN PUBLIC LAW
The system of administration of justice that we have now commenced with the Charter of Justice introduced by the British in the year 1801, which established the Supreme Court. This brought about for the first time a separation between the Governor who exercised Executive and Legislative power and the Courts which exercised Judicial power. Thus, a firm tradition of separation of power was established which forms the bedrock of the Rule of Law. The Courts Ordinance that came into force in 1890 consolidated the laws with regard to Courts and their powers and established the Magistrate Courts, the District Courts and the Supreme Court. This structure continued till the Administration of Justice Law was enacted in 1973, which established for the first time the High Courts in this country. The High Courts thus established functioned in the respective zones throughout the country and were not vested with appellate jurisdiction but exercised only the original criminal jurisdiction hitherto exercised by the Supreme Court.
The Court of Appeal
The next change came with the enactment of the present Constitution in 1978. It established for the first time the Court of Appeal. The Appellate jurisdiction hitherto exercised by the Supreme Court was vested in the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court was vested with Constitutional jurisdiction as the final Appellate Court. A two tired Appellate structure was thus created with the first appeal to the Court of Appeal from any original court to be availed of as of right by an aggrieved party and a second appeal to the Supreme court to be exercised only with leave to be granted in respect of substantial questions of law or where the matter was considered fit for review by the Supreme Court (Article 128 of the Constitution).
This innovation of the establishment of a Court of Appeal to which all appeals then pending before the Supreme Court stood removed, brought about a delay in the process of disposing of appeals. The fact that there was another appeal to the Supreme Court made it incumbent on the Court of Appeal to deliver considered judgements on all matters that were decided upon slowing down the pace of disposal to a point where the Court accumulated a backlog of appeals. Several steps were taken over the years to relieve the burden of the Court of Appeal. Quite apart from the inordinate delay, the exercise of appellate jurisdiction by the Court of Appeal, based only in Colombo has other negative factors, they are (i) litigants from far remote parts of the country have to trek to Colombo for the purpose of their civil appeals and (ii) they have to retain Counsel in Colombo and incur a higher overall costs than at Provincial Level.
The Provincial High Court
Gradually steps were taken to transfer the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to the High Courts. The process commenced with the 11th Amendment to the Constitution effected in 1987 which amended Article 111(1) of the Constitution by deleting the reference to the High Court as being a Court of original jurisdiction. This paved the way for the High Court to exercise appellate jurisdiction, in addition to its original jurisdiction. The 13th Amendment to the Constitution effected in 1987 established Provincial Councils as a measure of devolving power directed at a settlement of the ethnic problem and the then ongoing conflict. Article 154P of the 13th Amendment vested an appellate jurisdiction in the Provincial High Court in respect of Magistrates Courts and Primary Courts within the Province. It also vested a writ jurisdiction in the Court with regard to matters set out in the Provincial Council List. Article 154P ( c) left an opening to widen the jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court by stating that the Court could exercise such other jurisdiction and power as Parliament may by law provide.
It is in pursuance of this provision in the Constitution that the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Amendment Act No.54 of 2006, was enacted by Parliament and certified on 28.12.2006. This Act amends the previous Act No. 19 of 1990, which vested in the High Court of the Provinces appellate jurisdiction in respect of orders of Labour Tribunals and those made in terms of sections 5 or 9 of the Agrarian Services Act. Section 5A of the Act No.54 of 2006 provides that High Courts established by Article 154P of the Constitution shall exercise Appellate and Revisionary jurisdiction in respect of judgements, decrees and orders delivered and made by the District or Family Courts, within such Province.
In general, when a person wishes to seek redress from a judgement or order of a lower court by appealing therefrom or moving a Revision, three questions have to be addressed. They are;
(i) What Court has appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of the impugned judgement or order;
(ii) The right or status of a party to invoke appellate or revisionary jurisdiction;
(iii) The procedure including time limits in regard to the invocation of such appellate or revisionary jurisdiction.
Section 5A of Act No.54 of 2006, vests in the Provincial High Court with a concurrent jurisdiction with that of the Court of Appeal in regard appeals and applications in revision from District Court within the Province.
With regard to right of parties to invoke the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court, in regard to appeals, this is considered a right of appeal and as regards revision application this is considered as locus standi, since revision is not restricted to a party in the original action. With regard to the third matter referred to above- time limits and procedure- as stated above section 5A(2) of Act No. 54 of 2006 makes all the relevant provisions of the Civil Procedure Code and Rules of the Supreme Court (being written law in terms of the definition in Article 170 of the Constitution) applicable in relation to Court of Appeal to be operative in relation to the Provincial High Courts that are now vested with concurrent jurisdiction.
Writ Jurisdiction
A citizen who is aggrieved by a decision of a public body or inaction of a public body has a variety of remedies available under public law. The administrative action and / or inaction on the part of a judge of any court, tribunal of first instance or other institutions or any person having legal authority to determine questions affecting the rights of subjects having the duty to act judicially may be challenged by way of judicial review. One means of the Court through which executive acts and decisions affecting rights of the people may be reviewed is its writ jurisdiction.
Mark Fernando J, who pronounced the judgement of Heather Mundy v Central Environmental Authority and Others for the Supreme Court reviewing the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under Article 140 of the Constitution stated as follows:
The jurisdiction conferred by Article 140, however, is not confined to prerogative writs or extra-ordinary remedies, but extends  subject to the provisions of the Constitution  to orders in the nature of writs of Certiorari etc. Taken in the context of our constitutional principles and provisions, these orders constitute one of the principal safeguards against excess and abuse of executive power: mandating the judiciary to defend the Sovereignty of the people enshrined in Article 3 against infringement or encroachment by the Executive, with no trace of any deference due to the Crown and its agents.
Fernando J. further added in the judgement that the Supreme Court itself has long recognized and applied the Public Trust Doctrine: that powers vested in public authorities are not absolute or unfettered but are held in trust for the public, to be exercised for the purposes for which they have been conferred, and that their exercise is subject to judicial review by reference to those purposes. (De Silva v Atukorale; Jayawardene v Wijayatilake; Bandara v Premachandra) and that Public Trust Doctrine extends to national and natural resources (such as air-waves, Fernando v SLBC), and mineral deposits, (Bulankulama v Secretary, Ministry of Industrial Development.)
Utility of the Public Trust Doctrine of Sri Lanka
The Supreme Court utilizes this doctrine as a potential tool for a multitude of purposes: (a) to rectify the abuse of discretionary power, (b) to prevent the exploitation of natural resources and (c) to shield the under privileged.
(a). A tool to rectify abuse of discretionary power.
It is an essential reality in Sri Lanka that legislature cannot legislate for every possible circumstance. In consequence, the conferring of discretionary power upon public official is essential. However, such discretionary power so conferred are not unlimited, unconstrained power. The Supreme Court echoes this sentiment in Palihawadana v AG and Two Others by observing that when a power is entrusted to a high and responsible officer, he may be expected to act reasonably, objectively and without bias while discharging his duties. When a public official exceeds his discretionary powers, the Court on the basis of public trust doctrine can hold such person accountable for his actions.
(b). To prevent the exploitation of natural resources.
In Bulankulama Case, where the Doctrine of Public Trust and equality provisions were invoked, the Supreme Court recognizing the right to sustainable development with its component of inter generational equity decided that the State had failed to fulfill its obligation as public trustee resulting in infringement of fundamental rights of petitioners.
( c). A shield for the under privileged
Public Trust Doctrine also serves as a shield for the under privileged. This Doctrine may be uses to facilitate the Rule of Law, thereby serving as a shield to protect the minorities and the under privileged. Therefore ensuring dignity and respect for all regardless of their socio-economic standing and belief is a logical extension of the doctrine as well.
FR Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
Apart from the above the executive power is also necessarily subject to the fundamental rights in general and to Article 12(1) in particular which guarantees equality before the law and the equal protection of the law. For the purposes of the appeals the protection of the law would include right to notice and to be heard.
The link between the writ jurisdiction and fundamental rights is also apparent from Article 126(3), which contemplates that evidence of an infringement of fundamental rights may properly arise in the course of hearing a writ application, whereupon such application must be referred to the Supreme Court which may grant such relief or make such direction as it may deem just and equitable. Thus although the Supreme Court would still be exercising the writ jurisdiction, its powers of review and relief would not be confined to the old prerogative writs.
These constitutional principles and provisions according to Fernando J., have shrunk the area of administrative discretion and immunity and have correspondingly expanded the nature and the scope of the public duties amenable to Mandamus and the categories of wrongful acts and decisions subject to Certiorari and Prohibition as well as the scope of judicial review and relief. Due to the excessive time taken to reach finality in a writ application, in average three to four years, in appropriate cases, there is a tendency to evoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court by way of a Fundamental Right Application. It is also noted here that as provided under the recent 19th Amendment to the Constitution, the right of a person to make a FR Application under Article 126 against the Attorney General in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by the President is secured.
Public Interest Litigation and Locus Standi
There appears to be constitutional obstacles for class action or public interest litigation involving the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in terms of Article 126 of the Constitution. In terms of Article 126(2) where any person alleges that any such fundamental right or language right relating to such person has been infringed or about to be infringed by executive or administrative action, he may himself or by an Attorney at law on his behalf, within one month thereof in accordance with the rules of the courts apply to the Supreme Court for relief. Therefore it is clear that only the person whose fundamental rights have been violated could complain either by himself or by an Attorney at law.
In Somawathie v Weerasinghe the Supreme Court rejected an application by the wife complaining that her husband, who was in detention was subject to torture, inhuman and degrading treatment on the basis that the petitioner (wife) had no locus standi in terms of Article 126 (2) of the Constitution. The turning point in public interest litigation in fundamental rights applications was Environmental Foundation Ltd v Urban Development Authority and Others (also known as Galleface Green case). In this case His Lordship Sarath N Silva CJ., upheld the locus standi of Environmental Foundation Ltd which had acted in public interest in the matter of protecting the environment holding that the refusal of the UDA to disclose the information constituted an infringement of Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, even prior to the recent amendment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution recognizing the right to access to information as an enforceable right.
In the recent times, public interest litigation / locus standi has been permitted in a number of cases filed in terms of Article 126 of the Constitution such as in Mendis and Others v Kumaratunge and Others (also known as Waters Edge case) and in Vasudewa Nanayakkara v Choksy and Others also known (Lanka Marine Services Case). In Vasudewa Nanayakkara case, His Lordship Sarath N Silva CJ held:
Where the Executive being the custodian of the peoples power, acts ultra vires in derogation of the law and procedures that are intended to safeguard the resources of the State, it is in the public interest to challenge such action before Court.
(Professor Sarath Mathilal de Silva read law for his PhD and taught the subject at the University of Sri Jayawardenapura. Upon retirement, he is now a full time Attorney-at-Law.)

Killing of cops: Ex-LTTE cadre arrested
An ex-LTTE member has been arrested in connection with the murder of two constables at a police post in Vavunativu, Batticaloa. He is said to be a rehabilitated ex-cadre.
According to the police, the arrested suspect is Rasanayagam Sarvananthan (48), a resident of Hudson Road, Vattakachchi, Kilinochchi.
He was taken into custody on Saturday (01) and handed over to the CID for investigation.
It is reported that the killing of the two policemen was in retaliation for not allowing a Mahavir commemoration to take place in Vavunativu, where loudspeakers were to be used to commemorate former LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, when the areas police OIC arrived and halted it.
However, the suspect and the others later lit lamps and held their commemoration, reports say.
The suspect is said to have been a member of the LTTE from his childhood, according to investigations.
The two murdered constables Niroshan Indika Prasanna and Ganesh Dinesh have been posthumously promoted to the rank of sergeant.
Meanwhile, reports also indicated that a protest was staged yesterday in Batticaloa, opposite the clock tower, against the killing of the two policemen. Another protest was also scheduled to take place last evening by the ex-LTTE cadres.

Koala fingerprints are almost  indistinguishable from a humans
Now, were often told that monkeys (or apes, if you prefer) are our closest living relatives. The similarities are a little too close for comfort at times, as anyone whos seen those guys lazily scratching their hindquarters at the zoo will tell you.
Theres a real humanity about these gentle, hairy souls, and an astonishing intelligence too. In the famous case of Koko the gorilla, they were shown to have the capacity to understand 2,000 words of English and use a vocabulary of 1,000 words of sign language. Thats amazing enough, but how about this: the similarities between chimp, koala and human prints are so strong that the Australian police once feared theyd be mixed up at crime scenes!
This curious story begins in 1975 when British police conducted a most unusual raid on the ape houses at London and Twycross Zoos. Their target Half a dozen chimpanzees and a pair of orangutans, according to The Independent. The operation took place at a time when unsolved crime was becoming a bigger and bigger issue in the country, which somehow resulted in the fingerprints of these noble creatures being taken for analysis!
They werent found to be guilty of any criminal activity, funnily enough. All of this isnt as absurd as it may sound, though. Steve Haylock, of the City of London police fingerprint bureau, explained the thought process. According to him, the operation took place partly because the police tend to refer to smudged or unclear fingerprints as monkey prints.
If you passed a chimpanzee print to a fingerprint office and said it came from the scene of a crime, Haylock said, they would not know it was not human.
In the event, the chimpanzees sat happily enough as their fingerprints were taken; and were not found to have committed any of the crimes that were baffling police at the time (again, unsurprisingly). If that was the end of the story, it would have been a fascinating little case study in and of itself, but theres more to it. Well pick up this intriguing tale in Australia, where police feared that criminal investigations may have been hampered by koala prints!
What do humans, chimpanzees, and koalas have in common, then The simple need to grasp things. As researchers at the University of Adelaide (who discovered koala prints in 1996) stated in their paper on the subject:
Koalas  feed by climbing vertically onto the smaller branches of eucalyptus trees, reaching out, grasping handfuls of leaves and bringing them to the mouth therefore the origin of dermatoglyphes [fingerprints] is best explained as the biomechanical adaptation to grasping, which produces multidirectional mechanical influences on the skin.
These forces must be precisely felt for fine control of movement and static pressures and hence require orderly organization of the skin surface.
With all of this in mind, we can only hope that koalas and chimpanzees never decide to go off on wanton crime sprees. Imagine the confusion.

The Litro Gas Company made a (pre tax) profit of Rs. 18.6 billion during the time of President Mahinda Rajapaksa before 2015. Later (after 2015) it started to make a loss of Rs.200 million. This is obvious because it had paid over Rs. 2.5 million monthly for 57 outsiders, MP Rohitha Abeygunawardana said.
Addressing a press conference at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Head Quarters in Battaramulla yesterday, he said that in one year, the company had paid Rs. 37.5 million for those persons and during the past three and half years the company had paid over one billion rupees to them.
The law should be implemented against both parties who made the payments and for persons who received the money. Unlike the previous Government, this Government will not imprison Buddhist monks for launching death fasts and for campaigning against the Government. The law will be implemented by the relevant institutions.
MP Prasanna Ranatunga said that this Government and politicians do not have time to waste on taking revenge from the Opposition MPs and their supporters like the previous Government did. This Government has to do a lot of work in order to save the country from the disaster created by the previous Government and to relieve the people from numerous burdens such as taxes, the underworld, etc.

Moratuwa St Sebastian establishes chemical treatment pressure plant
Managing Director of St Sebastian Group of Companies, Moratuwa Dr. Harsha Fernando has established a Chemical Treatment Pressure Plant, to further improve and widen the companys operations in increasing the shelf life of wood.
The factory located on No 679/2, Old Galle Road, Horethuduwa, Moratuwa has established this Chemical Treatment Pressure Plant to conduct the Pressure Impregnation Method of wood treatment. Any type of wood, can be rid of termites, insects and fungi and last a lifetime through this treatment.
The machine can handle up to 5000 square foot pieces of timber and it is chemically treated for about four hours. In this process, a 15000l chemical mix of boron, boric acid, anti-borer and anti-blue in vapor form is injected into the wood, under a pressure of 15 bars. This chemical mix gets settled in the wood and destroys all insects that attack wood. Later on, even if the insects eggs are hatched; the larvae would consume the chemical mixture and be killed. This chemical mixture thus would greatly help in killing all insects and fungi within the wood, preventing the wood from perishing thus protecting it over a lifetime.
Wood types like Rubber, Mahogany, Hora, Liyan, Grandis, Alstonia, Naaimbul, Dawata, Paaramara,and Sooriyamara can be treated thus and preserved for a long period of time. Wood treated in this manner can be used without fear to build doors, windows, louvers, roofs, and home furniture. Visit Sebastian Saw Mill and Timber Depot in Moratuwa and get your wood treated to ensure they are strong and long lasting.

Hand puppets are fun. It is a natural and fun extension of the pretend play that young children engage in so readily. With a little encouragement from the elders, the hand puppets will help children develop some important learning skills. Hand Puppet play is imaginative and open-ended and equally freeing for adults. Let the child take the lead.
And dont forget the puppet theatre. Half the fun of putting on a puppet play comes in planning the performance. But the final result requires a way to let kids showcase their creation. Whether you fashion one out bed sheets or purchase one readymade, a puppet theatre is a must!
Creating a puppet show as a family is a wonderful way to help kids learn to work as part of a group and strengthen family ties at the same time.
It takes a skilled team of players to bring stories to life in a puppet theatre. Kumudu de Silva and Sulochana Dissanayake have placed trust in that philosophy when they bring life to stories. Find Your Bell authored by Kumudu de Silva comes to puppet life at Sooriya Village with Sulochana Dissanayakes direction. Find Your Bell is a part of a 40-book series. The series is a beautiful blend of the science of Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) and the art of story-telling.
My aim is to provide children with an early start in understanding and managing their emotions. The understanding of their own emotions will enable the children to set and achieve positive goals for themselves, make responsible decisions, show empathy towards others and thereby establish and maintain positive relationships.
A Neuro-Linguistic Programming Practitioner, Kumudu de Silva has conducted research, studied different mindfulness practices and gathered literature in child psychology. She has been publishing SEL content for children since 2016. Find Your Bell was once ranked among the 10 best-selling books in childrens self-help book category in Amazon.com.
Kumudu has signed up with the little hears foundation from September 2018. 15% of the sales price of each of her books will be donated to Little Hearts Foundation.
The story is about Rolly, a baby snail who feels very small and unimportant. As the story unfolds Rolly realizes that he tends to forget what he is very good at, instead keeps on thinking what he is not so good at and feels sad most of the time. Later, Rolly understands that there is uniqueness in everyone and that it is the best to be himself in his own way, Kumudu summarizes the story.
The story is brought to life by an interactive puppet show by Power of Play PVT LTD. Founded by Sulochana Dissanayake in 2011, Power of Play has broken down barriers and entertained audiences via art forms with universal appeal, cultural diversity and a rich history.
Why are the books converted for interactive puppet shows
It is our observation that the children tend to forget what we say to them, but they never forget how we make them feel. Hence, the books had been converted to interactive puppet shows and storytelling sessions to make the children feel the key messages in the storybooks, Sulochana Dissanayaka elaborates.
Founder and Artistic Director of Power of Play (PVT) LTD, Sulochana Dissanayake is a theatre creator, educator, trainer and puppeteer. Upon completion of a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics and Theatre from Bates College in Maine, USA, Dissanayake was awarded a Watson Fellowship by the Thomas J. Watson Foundation (established by IBM Corporation). Her study of Social Economics together with formal training in acting, directing, playwriting and puppetry taught her the significance of communication through non-traditional means and set her on the path that culminated in Power of Play. Dissanayake gained international experience using theatre, performance and puppetry to connect with diverse audiences in USA, Europe, Africa and Asia. She employs creative and interactive techniques to convey information and is passionate about introducing others to the magic of performing arts.
Sooriya Village will be hosting Find Your Bell on December 8 at 6.30 pm.

Communication and Social Skills
* Hand Puppets are an ideal springboard for developing speaking and listening skills.
* Children often communicate more easily with puppets, giving them the confidence to express their ideas and feelings.
* Shy children can become acquainted with others through the roles they take on.
* Children are free to try on new personalities and take them off again, with a puppet on their hand, broadening their own in the process.
* Scary animal hand puppets like lions and sharks or shy ones such as a tortoise can help children master uncomfortable feelings.
* Puppet play provides an opportunity to gain some control over their world by working out fears and frustrations.
Creative Skills
* Hand Puppet play helps young children develop creative skills by forcing them to use their imaginations. They make up the roles, the rules, the situations and the solutions.
* It is through imaginative play that children come to understand the differences between fantasy and reality.
* The real world becomes more real for children who have opportunities to pretend.

Only SLR has offered a seat to a woman in ex-co, says Asanga
Former Sri Lanka Rugby (SLR) President and current vice president of National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka(SLNOC) Asanga Seneviratne said only Sri Lanka Rugby has offered a seat on their Executive Committee to a woman out of 62 sports administration bodies in Sri Lanka.
He made these remarks at the launching of the IOC Women and Sport trophies Press Conference held at NOC on Tuesday.
He further said Bridging the gender gap - for a country that produced the first head of state Sri Lanka lags behind in empowering women and gender equality.
Being a High performance head at NOC further said when we listed elite athletes for the future programs and It seems nearly 65 % of our elite athletes are women and as far as I know only Sri Lanka Rugby has offered a seat on their Executive committee to a woman. Even our NOC doesnt have a allocation for women in their ex-co.
International Olympic Committee has a 30% ratio allocation for women on their ex-co and will enforce all NOC s and members to follow this allocation system soon.
The SLNOC is now in the forefront of bridging the gap and empowering women to take control of their respective sports.
This is first time we are participating in the IOC Women and Sport Awards and I dont know why we didnt participate on past occasions. The current women development committee of SLNOC will be more concerned with their work.
IOC Women and Sport trophies are awarded annually to promote the advancement of gender equality in sport. They recognise outstanding achievement and contributions made to develop, encourage and strengthen the participation of women and girls at all levels in the sports world in order to close the gender gap. Six (6) Trophies are awarded each year as follows: One at the world level - One each for Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania.

Pavarotti film taking shape for big debut
Filmmaker Ron Howard's much-anticipated Luciano Pavarotti documentary will feature unseen footage of the iconic opera singer and interviews with his widow Nicoletta and rocker Bono.
Nine minutes of Pavarotti were aired at the American Film Market in October and now sources tell Deadline distributors around the world are clamouring for the rights, with deals for Germany, Spain, China, Australia, Japan, and South Korea, among other territories, already completed.
The documentary, which is currently in post-production, will also feature memorable Pavarotti performances, including songs he recorded and sang as part of The Three Tenors, alongside Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo.
Howard, who is also one of the film's producers alongside Nigel Sinclair, Brian Grazer, and Michael Rosenberg, tells Deadline he has also secured the rights to Pavarotti performances, which will available to play in cinemas after the film's credits have rolled.
The movie is scheduled for release early next year.
Pavarotti, who had a promising soccer career in his youth, went on to become one of the opera greats after suffering a life-threatening illness.
He sold more than 100 million records and was particularly well known for his rendition of Nessun Dorma from Giacomo Puccini's opera Turandot. He also famously dueted with Bono in 1995 on U2's song Sarajevo Girl.
The track became the first of many crossover collaborations for Pavarotti, who died in Italy in 2007, just weeks before his 72nd birthday. Rolling Stone

Pitch perfect goal for Australian crickets grass gurus
SYDNEY: Mostly green and often downtrodden, the humble grass on which the highly-anticipated Australia-India Tests will be played doesn't normally attract as many headlines as superstars Virat Kohli and Mitchell Starc.
Yet the turf on Australia's ovals can play a critical role in determining the outcome of the highly-anticipated four-Test series, which begins in Adelaide on Thursday, and is often the subject of fierce debate among players, pundits and fans.
It all serves to turn up the heat on the curators -- the behind-the-scenes gods of the field -- who delve into the depths of horticultural science to engineer the ground carefully for each format of the game.
Adam Lewis joined the exclusive club when he became just the ninth curator of the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) a year ago, taking over from Tom Parker who retired after two decades.
Matt Page assumed the prestigious role at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) late last year after five years at Perth's WACA Ground. Both are aware of the public's high expectations after predecessors came under fire for their pitches.
You've got to have pretty strong shoulders, Lewis told AFP.
You notice with cricket, everyone has an opinion. You can't please everybody. Just as long as I can provide a good even surface for both sides, then I'm happy with that. Satisfying teams and fans can be a difficult task.
The world-famous MCG was slammed by critics and received an official poor rating from the International Cricket Council -- the first time for an Australian pitch -- after the Ashes Boxing Day Test almost a year ago.
The governing body said it did not change over the five days of the match against England, giving neither batsmen nor bowlers a chance to seize control of the match, which ended in a tedious draw.
The outcry reflected just how important the pitch is to players, fans and administrators who have invested time -- and lots of money -- to watch a dramatic contest. Despite the immense pressure, the curators are focused on the root of their jobs -- nurturing the plants and trying to get the best out of them every time. The 170-year-old SCG, alongside Brisbane's The Gabba, is only one of two major Australian grounds left using a traditional pitch, which remains in the ground and is adjusted for different sports and seasons. By contrast, the MCG uses a drop-in pitch that is tended to and AFP

Port City sponsors book on social etiquette
The Sinhala version of a childrens book based on the analects of renowned Chinese Philosopher Confucius, translated by Ven. Bodagama Chandima Thera, was donated by Port City to be distributed in schools.
Confucius was a scholar, teacher and educator. He was born in China about 2,500 years ago. Confucius deeply influenced Chinese culture, and it extends throughout the world even today. He believed that moral principles, virtues, and discipline should be the first lessons to be taught to a child, and that a child needs to practice them daily.
The outline of the book is based on the teachings of Confucius, compiled and edited over a period of thousands of years.
It explains the standards of living for children that would help them in early development. The book titled, Standards for being a good student and child spells out the need to respect parents and teachers, and the importance of inculcating good practices that would make them responsible citizens in the future. Ven. Bodagama Chandima Thera, Chief Prelate of Manelwatta Temple, Professor and Dean of the Nagananda International Buddhist University, translated the book to introduce Confucius precepts to Lankan children.
The Thera requested Port Citys assistance in printing the book, for distribution to local schools.
The project company handed over the first set of 2,000 books at a ceremony held at the University premises. Chandima Thera said he studied Chinese culture and traditions over the last 30 years and added that the teachings of the great philosopher would be of benefit to local children.
The Thera thanked the project company for their support in taking this knowledge to Lankan children. He said China Harbour Engineering Company had been encouraging and helpful in completing the Nagananda International Buddhist University building, scheduled to officially open in two years. The university, once completed, would be able to provide boarding facilities to 5,000 international students and 1,000 local students. Currently, it houses 600 students including those from Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand.
The ceremony to handover the books was attended by Assistant General Manager of Port City Colombo Simon Tham and Head of Public Relations Kassapa Senarath.

Prestige Automobile unveils first-ever BMW i8 Roadster in Lanka
BMW Asia and Prestige Automobile Pvt Ltd introduced the first-ever BMW i8 Roadster, a car that takes the BMW i8s combination of locally emission-free mobility and high-calibre performance and sprinkles the drop-top driving experience into the mix. The first-ever BMW i8 Roadster exudes a whole new sensation of freedom, opening the door to virtually silent motoring and bringing an extra edge of purity to open-air motoring.
The first-ever BMW i8 Roadster is based on the LifeDrive vehicle architecture designed for BMW i cars. The aluminium Drive module brings together the powertrain, high-voltage battery, suspension, crash system and structural functions, while the Life module takes the form of a passenger cell hewn from carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP).
The BMW i8 has performed the role of sports car of the future with extraordinary success since the day it was launched. The progressively designed 2+2-seater doubles up as an eye-catching object of desire and a technological pioneer. Indeed, the i8 has been the worlds highest-selling hybrid sports car since it first hit the roads in 2014 and has collected an array of awards in recognition of its visionary design and trailblazing vehicle concept.
The first-ever BMW i8 Roadster also benefits from a low-weight construction, complete with low centre of gravity and even weight distribution. The aerodynamically optimised exterior  with model-specific gullwing doors and a soft-top roof that also displays great visual lightness  is a fine exponent of the signature BMW i design language. The result is a two-seater boasting a distinctive and elegantly stretched silhouette, and delivering an immediate promise of instantaneous power ready to be unleashed.

Proper Reforms to keep pace with times
At the opening ceremony of the first China International Import Expo (CIIE) that was recently concluded, President Xi Jinping pointed out that holding the CIIE is Chinas major initiative to still widen market access to the rest of the world, and that it demonstrates Chinas consistent position of supporting the multilateral trading system and promoting free trade. Indeed, to uphold economic globalization and free trade, China actively applied to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) and since its accession to the WTO, China has been a staunch supporter of the multilateral trading system, taking a firm position against protectionism, and actively promoted building a more open and inclusive world economy. It can be said that from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to the WTO and up till now, with the joint efforts of all its members including China, WTO has made significant contributions to promoting the liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment, and has greatly boosted global trade development and economic growth.
Nevertheless, the world economy is going through a profound adjustment, and protectionism and unilateralism are resurging. Economic globalization faces headwinds, and multilateralism and the system of free trade are under threat. WTO is facing three crises threatening its survival: first, it is about WTOs dispute settlement mechanism. The Appellate Body of the mechanism has seven members initially, but now there are only three of them. The appointment of the rest four is thwarted by individual members; second, individual members add tariffs, misusing the security exception clause in the WTO rules; third, a small subset of individual members adopt unilateral measures and ignore WTOs multilateral rules.
Multilateral trading system
This year marks the 40th anniversary of Chinas reform and opening-up. Over the past 40 years, it is the strong belief in reform and open economy that has brought up todays China. A country must keep pace with the times, and so are international organisations. WTO is no exception. We need to reexamine its rules and regulations and duties, enabling it to continue to play an active role under the new historical conditions. Thus, China firmly supports the necessary reform of the WTO and meanwhile, we believe that reform should be in the right direction and taking the right approach. To this end, China has put forward three basic principles and five suggestions on WTO reform.
The three basic principles are as follows:
First, the WTO reform shall preserve the core values of the multilateral trading system. We believe that non-discrimination and openness are the most important core values of the multilateral trading system. The WTO members should obey this while handling economic and trade relations with other members within the framework of multilateral rules.
Second, the WTO reform shall safeguard the development interests of developing members. The reform should provide developing members with flexibility and policy space needed for their economic development, contributing to the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and narrowing the North-South gap.
Third, the WTO reform shall follow the practice of decision-making by consensus. Reform is related to the future of the multilateral trading system. The choice of reform agenda and the final outcomes should be decided through consensus. The process shall be inclusive and open to all members, especially the developing ones.
China has five suggestions for the reform of the WTO:
First, the reform should uphold the primacy of the multilateral trading system. The reform should reinforce the centrality of the multilateral trading system in international trade liberalization and facilitation. It cannot be confused with the so-called new concepts and new expressions and we cannot deny the authority of the multilateral trading system.
Second, the priority of the reform is to address the key issues that threaten the survival of the WTO. The reform should rein in actions of unilateralism and protectionism with the strings of the WTO rules. It should solve urgent problems including the appointment blockage of Appellate Body members as soon as possible and ensure the smooth functioning of all aspects of the WTO.
Third, the reform should address the imbalance of trade rules and respond to the latest developments of our time. The reform should address the excessive agricultural subsidies of some developed members and prevent abuse of trade remedy measures. Meanwhile, the reform should promote the WTO rules to keep pace with the times and respond to the needs of the economic reality of the 21st century.
Fourth, the reform should safeguard the special and differential treatment for developing members. China is the largest developing country in the world and is willing to take up commitments commensurate with its level of development and economic capability. However, China will never agree to be deprived of its entitlement to special and differential treatment as a developing member.
Fifth, the reform should respect members development models. China opposes some members who deny the diversity of development models and discriminate against different ones. China disagrees on incorporating the development model issue into the WTO reform agenda.
It is noteworthy that all the principles and suggestions are not intended for serving Chinas own interests. They are put forward so that all WTO members could work together to uphold the multilateral trading system, promote WTO to develop in a fairer, more open, inclusive, efficient and authoritative way, and enable it to play a more significant role in global governance.
China firmly observes and upholds the WTO rules, and supports the multilateral trading system that is open, transparent, inclusive and non-discriminatory. China has participated in all aspects of WTO work, made its voice heard and contributed its own proposals on improving global economic governance. China is an active participant, strong supporter and major contributor in the multilateral trading system. And while actively developing itself, China also pursues an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win results and is willing to offer more public goods to the international community. China proposes the Belt and Road Initiative, openly supports globalization and strives to make the pie of the global economy bigger in helping countries to achieve their own development goals.
Economic globalization
To demonstrate our firm determination to support economic globalization, China has just held the first CIIE in Shanghai. The CIIE has not only provided countries with new opportunities to expand exports to China but also established a platform for them to carry out trade activities and share business opportunities with each other. This clearly shows Chinas responsibility as a major nation in actively promoting economic globalization. Sri Lanka actively participated in the first CIIE. There are altogether six Sri Lankan government organisations taking part in the National Pavilion and 29 quality companies in the Business Exhibition. Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB), which organised Sri Lankas participation in the CIIE, indicates that Sri Lankas participation this time was a huge success with fruitful results. EDB thanked China for providing Sri Lanka with such a broad cooperation platform and looks forward to participating in the next CIIE. Hence it can be seen that an open world economy which China upholds has benefited not only itself but also the whole world. Meanwhile, it has brought tangible benefits to Sri Lanka.
Both China and Sri Lanka are developing countries, so we could better understand the importance of an open, inclusive and fair multilateral trading system to our own development, and the necessity of WTO reform under the current situation of rising unilateralism and protectionism. Located at the centre of the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka has acted as a regional trade centre since ancient times. Sri Lanka has not only played its role as a central node in promoting global trade development but also benefited a lot from the free trading system. The biggest common issue facing China and Sri Lanka, both as developing members in the WTO, is a development which is the core mission of the WTO. Currently, some developed members question the necessity of special and differential treatment on the pretext of significant economic development of some developing members. This runs counter to the WTO rules and violates the interests of the vast majority of developing members. Holding the same expectation for a more open and inclusive multilateral trading system, China is willing to work together with Sri Lanka in upholding the unity and development space of developing members and making our concerns be fully considered and properly dealt with.
China and Sri Lanka are traditionally friendly neighbours. In history, Master Fa Xian came to Sri Lanka to learn Buddhism, Zheng He Fleet visited Sri Lanka five times, and our two nations signed the famous Rubber-Rice Pact; at present, the Belt and Road Initiative has opened up new channels for our economic and trade cooperation and people-to-people contacts, and the China International Import Expo offers the whole world, including Sri Lanka, a new trade sharing platform; in the future, with the deepening of friendship and closer economic and trade ties between our two countries, we will definitely strengthen cooperation in the global governance system including WTO, defend our common interests, and promote building a community with shared future for China and Sri Lanka.
Economic globalization and the multilateral trading system are an irreversible trend of history, independent of peoples will. Chinas economic growth over the past 40 years has been achieved with a commitment to opening-up. In the same vein, high-quality development of Chinas economy in the future can only be guaranteed with greater openness. In the meantime, we believe that Sri Lankas development must also be rooted in an open and inclusive multilateral trading system and the global economic system. China looks forward to working with Sri Lanka to share opportunities and jointly meet challenges. Together, let us promote WTO reform to be fairer, more open, inclusive, efficient and beneficial for all, make economies of the world interconnected, build a higher-level open world economy, and deliver the benefits of free trade to every corner of the world.

Rahm wins Hero World Challenge
Nassau, Sunday: Jon Rahm says a putting tip last August from tournament host Tiger Woods helped the Spaniard to storm his way to a four-shot success at the Hero World Challenge on Sunday.
Rahm, 24, was never challenged over the final round, shooting a bogey-free 65 for a 20-under par total on the Albany course.
The win is Rahms third success this season and a seventh victory in his short two-year pro career and in the process sees Rahm move to a career high No. 6 on the world rankings.
Rahm had shared the lead on both day two and day three and capped his closing round with three birdies in four holes from the sixth.
Last September, Rahm was drawn in the Ryder Cup Sunday singles against boyhood idol Woods and delivered Europe their much-needed first point with two and one triumph.
Now Rahm has his name on Woods Hero World Challenge trophy.
That Sunday with Tiger is one of the most emotional, most important moments in my golf career, said Rahm.
I started crying when I was shaking his hand because that meant so much to me to play against Tiger Woods.
A couple of months later to win his event -- his Foundations event along with Hero, this is really special.
And it was the putting tip on the practice green at East Lake that has now sees Rahm become the first Spanish winner of the Hero World Challenge.
When we were at East Lake Tiger was putting next to me. I just cant putt on Bermuda as I had grown up in Spain on poa annua, said Rahm.
Tiger kind of laughed and said its all about feel out there. In presenting me the trophy he said, Hey, thats a pretty good performance from someone who cant putt on Bermuda greens.
American Tony Finau holed a dramatic 10-footer for birdie at the last in a score of 69 for second place at 16-under and in the process denying Justin Rose from returning to World No. 1. Rose, who eagled 15 in a last round 65, had been sharing second place in 15-under par and the assurance of again becoming World No. 1 only for Finau to pull the rug out from under the Englishman.
Its not a huge goal for me to be No. 1, but when you have these opportunities you want to take them, said Rose.
And Woods rounded-off his full-season return to competition with a tired-looking 73 to finish 17th in the 18-player field.
The entire year has been amazing and Ive just been so blessed to have the opportunity, said Woods. AFP

Ranjan the cats whisker on advanced judicial pronouncements - Rohitha
If there is anything to clarify about law and order and the judiciary, all including journalists should put their questions to UNP MP Ranjan Ramanayake, because he can predict as to what happens in the judiciary, MP Rohitha Abeygunawardana said.
There is a crucial judgment to be given in December in connection with him and the entire country is waiting for that, he said.
Addressing a press conference at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Head Quarters in Battaramulla yesterday, Abeygunawardana said that UNP MP Ranjan Ramanayake had also told the media that the Chief Justices performance is satisfactory at present and that he is waiting to see his future performance.
Now the entire country while focused on MP Ramanayake eagerly awaits a General Election to select their representatives, he said.
MP Abeygunawardana alleged that the price formula introduced by the former Finance MP cannot be understood.
The former Digital Infrastructure MP talks about the countrys President in an unacceptable manner.
May be, he had used dancing oil (Netum Thel) before his speech.
The Government is ready to face any election and therefore the UNP, JVP and TNA should withdraw their petition from the Supreme Court allowing for the holding of elections, Abeygunawardana added.

An open letter to all foreign embassies
Respect Sri Lankas sovereignty
Our organisation, De Dham Rakno, is a movement of the people of Sri Lanka, that is committed to preserving the sovereignty and the integrity of our country, and the right of all its people to live in peace, equality and harmony across the length and breadth of the island. It is not aligned or affiliated to any political party either directly or indirectly. It spurns foreign funds and is financed purely by the meagre contributions of its members and well wishers.
This letter is to express our utmost displeasure over the continuing acts of interference in the internal affairs of our country, by the ambassadors of some Western NATO countries and their allies both in the East and West, riding rough shod over Sri Lanka's sovereignty, with scant regard to the sensibilities of our people. Some of these ambassadors act in the most despicable and shameless manner, as if Sri Lanka is a colony of the countries they represent. They are not only violating all norms of diplomacy but are also flagrantly abusing our sovereignty.
In the aftermath of the recent ousting of Ranil Wickremesinghe from power, which is purely an internal matter of our country, the role that these ambassadors played in holding discussions with the Speaker of the House, Karu Jayasuriya and persuading the latter to change his earlier position recognizing the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new Prime Minister by the President, in accordance with the powers vested in him by the constitution, amply supports our position stated above. Their over eagerness to reinstall their ally Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister, led them to demean themselves to the level of DPL jokers, when they applauded and rejoiced in the lobby of the Parliament, over the declaration made by the Speaker that Mahinda Rajapaksa has lost a no confidence motion, that was rushed through Parliament without regard to proper procedures. They no doubt consider the occasion as a victory for their joint effort (or conspiracy) to restore Ranil Wickremesinghe to power.
We could have dismissed their behaviour lightly as arising from a burst of unbridled but crude expression of colonial mentality, if not for the fact that their Governments, casting aside international law, jointly endeavour to have their puppets installed and maintained in high offices in countries across the globe. In many a such country, these puppet regimes have readily allowed the wealth of their countries to be stolen by their masters, and further commit their people to serve in proxy wars to oust other legitimate governments that resist the demands of the Western NATO states. But we Sri Lankans do not want such a fate to befall us.
While civil unrest, military power struggles and separatist wars have brought untold suffering to people of nations that have undergone the regime changes effected by the NATO states, the wealth of the latter has burgeoned by the sale of armaments to the warring factions. The citizens of NATO states, basking in the comforts of sitting rooms furnished by such ill begotten wealth, are inclined to readily believe the reports churned out by the biased high profile Western media, without going through the trouble to ascertain the truth from alternative sources of information.
We also take this opportunity to call upon the Indian government, or rather, once again, its good hearted citizens, to examine their country's foreign policy, especially vis-a-vis its small neighbouring states. We believe that if India is to be the great world leader it has the potential to be, and we sincerely wish it to be so, it should seek its position in the world on its own merit. A great country that has produced the Buddha, an Asoka, a Gandhi and an Ambedkar, should be a beacon of righteousness to the world.
Even if we cannot forget India's past aggression, we can forgive India, if only it is in turn prepared to mend its ways allowing us to solve our problems by ourselves, truly respecting our sovereignty, integrity and independence. If India wishes to go further and live up to the claim it makes about the special status it affords our relationship, it can stand by us in resisting the pressure brought on us by the NATO states to carry out their diktats.
However they should realise that when they act hand in glove to our detriment, they cannot complain if we seek closer ties with other powerful countries in the world to protect our sovereignty.

Royal Plastic Molding turns to Nylon Plates for railway
Royal Plastic Molding, a subsidiary of Royal Marketing Panadura is manufacturing Nylon Plates for the first time for the use of railway tracks in Sri Lanka.
These Nylon plates named as Fish Plates were imported for several years from overseas costing several millions of dollars.
Managing Director, Royal Plastic Molding, Wasantha Perera said that when he saw the amount the government was paying to import these plastic railway plates, he requested his research team to look at the possibility of making it in Sri Lanka. In a few weeks we managed to match this plate and got approval from the Sri Lanka Railway Department to supply this locally.
He said the Nylon plate is used to join two railway tracks and each was imported for around Rs. 500. Royal Plastic, supplies this for less than Rs. 200 saving the Sri Lanka Railway around Rs. 70 million per year.
He also said that they also introduced the worlds first perfumed floor cleaning detergents using citronella oil which now used in leading hotels in Sri Lanka. We are now looking at exports. The company also owns and operates Sri Lankas third tooth brush manufacturing plant. Over 90% of toilet kit used in to five star and other hotels are made by Royal Super.
A family business which started in the backyard of a small house in Panadura in 1993, stole global attention when they designed and manufactured Sri Lankas first anti mosquito spray.
The Royal Marketing Company has been manufacturing over 10 products which includes radiator coolant, air freshener, car wash, rubber grease, battery water, battery terminals and multiple washing liquid. The company has been manufacturing plastic bottles, cans, buckets, and various plastic containers for the local market. (SS)

Sri Lankan Udara Jayasundara excels in Australia
For eight rounds many within the Illawarra cricketing community have been waiting for Udara Jayasundara to single-handedly turn a game in his teams favour. On Saturday, he did exactly that.
Living in Wollongong and playing for Wests while his wife studies at the University of Wollongong, Jayasundaras talent with the ball in hand proved far too good for a hapless Helensburgh side.
The former Sri Lankan Test representative spun through the Helensburgh batting lineup at Figtree Oval, claiming figures of 8-32 in a masterful display as the Tigers were bowled out for 111.
It was a great bowling performance, he really did a job for us, Wests captain Tylar Edwards said. I was expecting that he would do something like that at some point in the season, he did it yesterday and it was very impressive.
All our bowlers did their job at the other end, built pressure, and that allowed Udara to spin his web. At some points batsmen were looking to score off him, and thats how he was able to take his wickets.
Despite playing as a batting all-rounder, Jayasundara boasts the full repertoire of deliveries every top leg-spin bowler possesses, including the traditional leg-break, the wrong un, and the flipper.
On Saturday, it was those variations the brought Helensburgh undone, with batsmen exposed to a variety of deliveries and quality-level rarely seen in Cricket Illawarra competition. Unsurprisingly, they were not up to the challenge. Hes a leg spinner, but it was the wrong uns and flippers that got the wickets.
He was only a part-time bowler in Sri Lanka, but you can tell he has experience. Coming from the subcontinent where spins the main weapon, hes bowled a lot of it and he brought that experience to tear them apart.
The wicket wasnt turning too much, it was more the skill of Udara with his variations to set the batsmen up and bamboozle them.
Saturday wasnt all one-way traffic, however, with Helensburgh mounting a fightback late in the day.
Leading the charge was Luke Falkiner. Having recently returned from a stint in England, Falkiner continued his hot run of form to take three wickets and reduce Wests to 5-68 at stumps.
Edwards recognises his side still has a lot of work to do next Saturday to secure first-innings points, but he is confident there will be no further wobbles and they will finish off the job.

## Title: Sugar tax revise to benefit fruit juice producers

Sugar tax revise to benefit fruit juice producers
The recently revised sugar tax is expected to help the local fruit juice manufacturers and the local beverage industry, which suffered as a result of the blanket sugar tax introduced in November 2017.
National Economic Council (NEC) Secretary General Prof. Lalith Samarakoon, in a response to the Daily News, explained that the 2017 tax of Rs. 50 cents per gram of sugar in beverages discriminated against local fruit juice manufacturers and international beverage companies equally.
There was an inconsistent policy where the government was promoting fruit farming while increasing the tax on fruit drinks, essentially reducing their market, he said.
Over the past three years, the government, through the Agriculture Ministry and the Grama Shakthi programme, had been encouraging farmers to grow fruits, including for export.
However, 80 percent of their products being purchased by local fruit juice manufacturing companies were increasingly finding the market shrinking due to the tax.
The new revisions propose to have the tax levied only for carbonated drinks with a sugar content of 6g of sugar (per 100ml) and above.
For fruit-based drinks, that threshold was raised to 9g of sugar from 6g. Further, the rate of tax was reduced from Rs. 50 cents to Rs. 30 cents per gram for fruit drinks.
The government did not ignore the health aspects. Over time, the government should try to force drinks manufacturers to reduce the sugar content and educate the public to minimise sugary drinks. The transition will need time both for manufacturers and consumers, said Prof. Samarakoon.
The introduction of the colour coding system and sugar tax on beverages in 2017 has helped increase awareness among the public with regard to the sugar content in beverages.
However, local companies such as Ceylon Cold Stores (CCS) under which Elephant House operates, has pointed out that they were not given enough time to switch to sugar-free options before the tax was introduced. As a result, they had faced a 33 percent collapse in their carbonated drinks market on top of a currency collapse, which led to an economic downturn early this year.
Foreign companies, on the other hand, which have had experience with the sugar tax internationally, however, had an existing range of sugar-free drinks, which were readily rolled out and the companies continued to make a profit.
In April this year, CCS developed a sugar-free beverage portfolio but reprise for fruit juice manufacturers would not have come easily without a revision of the previous sugar tax structure which treated all beverages under the same umbrella.

Tatenda Taibu to play for Badureliya in Premier League
Former Zimbabwe cricket captain and convenor of selectors Tatenda Taibu is making a comeback to the cricket field and has signed up with Badureliya SC to play in the ongoing Premier League cricket tournament.
Taibu is due shortly in Sri Lanka to fulfill his contract.
The 35-year-old wicket-keeper/batsman is one of the few talented cricketers from Zimbabwe to make a name for himself at the highest level.
Making his debut against West Indies at Harare SC in 2001 he carved a reputation as one of the most skilled batsmen in all forms of cricket.
He represented his country in 28 Tests, 150 ODIs adb 17 T20Is. He was also a competent wicket-keeper.
However, in July 2012, he decided to bid adieu to the illustrious sport at the age of 29 and said that he would want to concentrate on working for the church.
Crictracker.com reported that the experienced campaigner approached the club after they had put out an advertisement for an overseas player in the lineup.
Badureliya SC has a history of playing overseas cricketers in the domestic tournaments. Afghanistans left-arm fast bowler Shapoor Zadran, Digvijay Amarnath, the son of former Indian Test cricketer Surinder Amarnath, Michael Richardson, son of former South African wicket-keeper/batsman and current ICC CEO Dave Richardson and Greg Smith, former Nottinghamshire batsman are some of the overseas players who have played for Badureliya SC.
Taibu will become the most high profile cricketer ever to represent the club.
According to the tournament rules a club can register a maximum of three overseas players but only two can play at one time.
Badureliya SC already has two Indian cricketers signed up with them and Taibu will be the third overseas player.

T.B. Kehelgamuwa was a fiery paceman
I went and knocked on his door at Pirivena gardens, Boralesgamuwa, he walked up to me lithely and there were no signs of arthritis which pace bowlers are prone to late in life. He was amiable from the word go.
OTTA PALU BALL
I do not wish to recycle what has been written about him by fellow scribes. However it would be interesting to note what he mentioned; Kehel was born at Kehelgamuwa a tiny village at Gampola, his late father was the principal of the village school. The scraggly eight year old was bursting with energy and got hold of an otta palu ball ( a golf size ball made with woven rubber strands),with this he was terrorising his batting friends, a master at Dharmaraja was walking by spotted the lad but not the improvised ball, it was whizzing by escaping the naked eye . The bewildered master highjacked him to Dharmaraja.
Kehelgamuwa-Yatawara paceduo who rocked the Englishmen.
He was put under another pace ace late Sonny Yatawara the barrel chested paceman.Kehel reminisced that both of them played for Sri Lanka and scared the hell out of the touring Englishmen, batsmen of the calibre of Boycott, Tom Graveney, Keith Fletcher etc this was the best pace combination Sri Lanka cricket ever had, Kehel of course was the faster of the two.
8 wickets for 8 runs all bowled
He recalled that when he toured with the Sri Lanka Schools (mind you he played for Ceylon when he was a school boy. In the match against the Indian Zonal champions, South Zone, he took 8 wickets for 8 runs all bowled, he hit the stumps on 11 occasions but three of the deliveries were deemed no-balls by the umpire. The veteran scribeLeo Wijesinghe happened to watch this match and he mentioned to me that the South Zone no 3 bat Makhan Singhes middle stump was sent cart wheeling all the way to the ropes.
No rocket science
At this point I interrupted Kehel to inquire whether he chucked some of the deliveries, he vehemently denied saying that his express run up and slinging action propelled the ball like a tracer bullet. He laughingly said no rocket science was involved. To me his run up was akin to Malcolm Marshall and his action was somewhat like Freddie Truemans, the blend was brilliant.
Kehel took to the Khaki uniform like a duck taking to water and rose up the ladder from Sub Inspector to Deputy Inspector General of Police. He was the Personal Assistant to three ex IGPS. He never dabbled in politics unlike these days he respected the uniform to a tee.
Rewinding back Kehel was the Cricket Manager of the Test Team to new Zealand in 1995.There was a ceremonial Manager as well whose duties must have been very much less than the Cricket Manager.Kehel had to organise the practice schedule, see to the morale of the players in short fully in charge and he pointed out that at the Police Force he handled thousands of policemen and he was well versed in tackling tough situations and even with tough nuts like Arjuna Ranatunga and Aravinda De Silva, he had his way not by coersion but by playing the right card at the right time. Earlier Stanley Jayasinghe and later Bandula Warnapura had tiffs with both Arjuna and Aravinda. In 1996 he had to abide by the call of duty thereby missing the glory of the World Cup triumph.
Not the love of money
The love of the game and certainly not the love of big bucks got Kehel back to the fold as a selector and after 10 years he was made the chief selector, he was not parachuted to the position and those days match referees were never heard of.
Chief Selector/ Match Referee
The author wonders how the former Chief Selector was in the West Indies match refereeing whilst our Test team was getting a colonial roasting by the pale faced Englishmen. Its not cricket mate its plain greed for money.At the time of writing the last nail in the coffin got hammered. We lost the third Test. There was no doubt our batters fought hard but the cancer still remains, the so called half fit all rounder who does not bowl, gets two half centuries and then gets out putting the side in dire straits. This is just to secure his place and let the team go to hell!He was never involved in helping his team in the Third Test where I was a frustrated spectator.I have seen cricketers of many a hue in England, Australia and The West Indies but I have never seen such a lackadaisical cricketer.
One bright spark in the SLCset up is Jerome Jayaratne who works hard behind the scenes. High time you come out of your shackles mate.
Getting back to T.B.Kehlgamuwa the Chief Selector, in his day there was no big brother the Sports Minister looking over his shoulder to change the selected squad, once done it was etched in stone.
Now that the Chief Selector and his buddies have been shown the door alas the horse has bolted. The higher ups who appoint the selectors have surely shuffled the pack, this time as well.
The love of the game never deserted Kehel ,his house is like a mini gallery, photographs of yore adorns his walls in the house, he lives with two of his three daughters all graduates and his wife an ex school teacher.The eldest is a deputy head of aleading International School in Colombo 7.
Kehel is simple and approachable the hallmark of all the ex Sri Lankan stalwarts that I have interviewed.

Time to bury the hatchet
A UNP delegation was scheduled to meet with President Maithripala Sirisena late last evening in what was termed by many as a last ditch attempt to find a way out of the present political crisis which from all indications the Present was keen on resolving considering the dire consequences the current political stalemate is bound to have on the economy and social life in general. There is no denying that the country is in a state of drift with little or no work done in Government departments where the discussions are centred on the protracted crisis and unfolding developments on the political scene.
There were positive signs, though, to indicate that the President was on the verge of resolving matters without letting the crisis prolong indefinitely. He has told a TNA delegation that met him on Friday that he would permit the party that showed a majority in Parliament to take the reins of Government. In an interview with our weekend publication, the Sunday Observer President Sirisena said he did not have any say on the matter as it should be resolved within the Legislature. If any party can muster the support of the majority, the other party which has failed to do so should work accordingly. Then, the party having the majority should govern on the basis that if they have the majority they should be the Government.
Last Thursday, Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, who, along the Ven. Athureliye Rathana Thera, were the only Government members to attend Parliament, struck a conciliatory note by urging both sides to resolve the crisis without further delay since the present crop of Parliamentarians and Parliament itself had become the laughing stock of the public, adding that should the crisis allowed to continue this would make the people lose all faith in the Parliamentary system and democracy itself. Like the President, he was of the firm view that the party commanding the majority in Parliament should be entrusted with governance and went further by appealing to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to meet the President and reach compromise to which the latter readily consented.
Rajapakshe it was widely felt was acting as a peace emissary of the President which was only confirmed by the subsequent sentiments expressed by the President to the TNA. The vast majority among the general public, no doubt, would greatly welcome this attempt at rapprochement, more so the Christians of this country who are all set to usher in Christmas in another two weeks time.
Christmas, as is the tradition, is a festival heralding peace, goodwill and reconciliation and a time when past enmities are resolved and hatred banished. It is the fervent wish of all that the warring parties will let bygones be bygones and reach a compromise where the problem is resolved to the satisfaction of all. Perhaps all religious leaders led by the Most Venerable Mahanayake Theras and the pro-active Archbishop of Colombo His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith could lead the way in getting both factions to see reality. No one, it is certain, would want the crisis to spill over into the New Year which would only bring dark forebodings to the nation.
One should also not lose sight of the fact that the crisis is boiling over at a time when 656,641 candidates are sitting for their GCE (O/L) examination. It is not clear in what mental state they are in, although the vast majority of them, obviously, will be disaffected by the goings-on, on the political stage strutted on by mature adults who have been entrusted with guiding the future of the nation. Nevertheless, it is not clear how the political turmoil which had affected every citizen in some way since the outset will have a bearing on the performance of these students whose future lies in the success at these examinations.
Hence it is all the more reason that the political standoff is brought to end without further delay and normality restored in the country. Both sides should make up their minds to discard their entrenched positions for the sake of the country and strike a bargain that would be a win-win one. The President has already shown a way out and it is left to the UNP to grasp the opportunity. There is some talk that the Supreme Court verdict on the dissolution of Parliament that was scheduled to be delivered on the 7th could be pushed back. In that event, a solution will have to wait until the Court eventually decides on the matter, as some in both camps have already expressed the position that they were waiting for the Courts final decision to decide on the next course of action.
This could only further exacerbate matters. We are almost at the end of the current year and funds to run the Government for the ensuing year will have to be approved through the annual budget, the presentation of which cannot be delayed any longer. Hence the need for statesmen like decisions on the part of the political leaders whose priority should be the countrys future well-being.

Traditional paddy varieties to be revived
The cultivation of traditional varieties of paddy is to be revived in the country at present.
Under a special programme, the farmer community would be encouraged to grow more traditional, high-quality paddy varieties, agriculture officials said.
The traditional paddy strains include marvie, samba, suwadel, rathdel, danahala, H4, gambada marvie and several others, officials said.
According to the Agriculture Ministry sources, over 3,000 acres of uncultivated land in the country have been brought under the plough for the purpose.
The only exception is that neither chemical fertiliser nor pesticides are used in the cultivation. They are also capable of resisting pests, insects and floods.
Paddy farmers are also being made aware of the significance of using organic manure and compost rather than chemical fertiliser in cultivations.
Cultivation instructions, agricultural know-how and other facilities would also be provided to farmers by the Agriculture Ministry.
It is targeted to bring about 100,000 acres under cultivation of traditional varieties of paddy soon, agriculture authorities said.
Steps would also be taken to encourage cultivators in this regard.
Enhancing the high quality rice production is the aim of these endeavours, agriculture project officials added.

A truce between fiction and fact
I say to you that every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away; it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away; it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell.  The Gospel of St. Mathew
According to Matthew, one of the direct paths to enter hell is to commit adultery. Chandran Rutnams new film, According to Matthew, revolves around a couple who commits adultery and descends to hell as it happened two decades ago in Sri Lanka in a church. Ironically, one of the accused was an Anglican priest.
The gloominess of which the four main characters are portrayed makes the film unique. The discipline of its director to confine himself strictly to the events and let the characters act their parts is distinct. It was a double murder that shook the nation in 1979. The accused were well-educated, accepted persons in society, especially the main accused, Rev. father Matthew Pieris. The film rarely shows its directors views over facts.
Mind: source of evil
It is mind that destructs soul. It is the mind, too, that enlightens the soul. On the other hand, evil never ends and the battle against it in the mind ever weakens. It batters even a person who is near the altar of the God all of his time. However, Chandran Rutnam does not manipulate his film to express the power of evil over good. Nor does he attempts to alter the facts to illuminate or obscure a religion.
One may, therefore, view the film as an attempt to recall events that led to a double murder and nothing else. It has marginally gone beyond the facts. It is not, therefore, altogether a fiction. One may even classify that it is inartistic and that it shows the events that led to a horrific double murder.
Cinematic disciplinary
But the strict cinematic disciplinary in Rutnam makes his film sublime and glues the audience to the screen. He does not exaggerate anything to make it a commercial success. Even the erotic scenes have no lewdness. He takes only what he needs from where he could have gone deep to rouse his audience to another spectrum. So, his masterly filmmaking lies in his cinematic discipline.
Father Mathew Pieris killed Russel Ingram, his lovers husband and his wife Eunice Pieris in 1979. He was the chief priest of the Anglican Church, St Paul the Apostle, Kynsey Road Colombo 10. Russel Ingram came to the vicarage along with his wife Daphne Reynolds seeking Gods salvation but father Pieris helped Russel in finding a job. He even appointed Russels wife as his secretary and took her to his possession with devils intention.
They were convicted for double murder and sentenced to death. But Daphne was acquitted in the subsequent appeal. Rev. Pieris was granted presidential pardon for his good conduct in the prison after many years. This last part is not in the film. Rutnam has taken only what he needs for the film. It lacks even the court drama except little bits of the hearing unlike in the book authored by Prof. Ravindra Fernando, Murders at the Vicarage, where the full court case unfolds.
Alston Koch stars as father Mathew Pieris. He hails from Sri Lanka and lives in Australia as an actor, song writer, film producer and record producer. He has portrayed his role effectively while Jacqueline Fernandez, also born in Sri Lanka and now a famous actress in Bollywood, infuses life into Daphne Reynolds. She also portrays her role convincingly. Bimsara Premaratna portrays father Matthews wife, Eunice Pieris, while Kian OGrady stars Daphnes husband.
Father Matthew Pieris was complex. He committed heinous crimes and attempted to make it divine in ways he behaved after those crimes. He even told the court that no one could judge him but the God.
Genuine attempt
The film is a genuine attempt to revive the events that led to a gruesome double murder in Sri Lanka for the young generation. It simply revolves around the facts and hardly touches magic in films. But there lies the expertise of the film director Chandram Rutnam, who has made many a blockbuster film.
Now, whisper according to Matthew, Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles

Vijayakala gets her wish
Some time ago the TNA MP Vijayakala Maheswaran said that the LTTE should re-emerge and now the violence has returned as she wished.
The best example is the murders of the two police officers at Vavunathivu, MP Rohitha Abeygunawardana said.
Addressing a press conference at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Head Quarters in Battaramulla yesterday he said that until January 9, 2015, even a firecracker did not go off in the North and the East because there was law and order and the people did not like to hear the sound.
But, after January 9, 2015 many armed groups such as Aava, Danurok etc became active. They killed people, destroyed properties and promoted violence. Some Tamil politicians openly said they will not hoist the National Flag. According to MP Abeygunawardana, in the past, the UNP Government set fire to Asias best library in Jaffna and sent the police on a three day vacation during black July in 1983 enabling mobs to kill people and destroy properties. Late President Ranasinghe Premadasa gave money, cement etc. to the LTTE which they used later to kill the members of Sri Lankan armed forces and thousands of innocent civilians. Now the UNP leader has agreed to give them Tamil Eelam indirectly for the support to be given by the TNA to him. The people of Sri Lanka demand a General Election. We tell the UNP, JVP and the TNA not to snatch the universal franchise of the Sri Lankan people.

We all scream over ice cream!
The Museum of Ice Cream - an Instagrammable pop-up funhouse devoted to the childlike pleasure of candy and frozen sweets - has frozen out a lot of guests since it first opened in 2016.
Its notoriously hard to get into: only open in certain cities (currently, San Francisco) for a limited time, and the $38 tickets sell out almost immediately. It leaves people scrolling through social media, longing for the day when theyll get their chance to dive into a pink swimming pool full of rainbow sprinkles and post Boomerangs of the experience that will make everyone jealous.
It celebrates the accessibility and democracy that ice cream brings, founder Maryellis Bunn said.
The experience will be an imaginative riff on a grocery store, featuring life-size pint installations, likely in the museums signature rainbow colors, and opportunities to take a million selfies and buy the new brand of ice cream. Guests can make paid reservations for a special tasting of all of the flavors, and theyll have the opportunity to learn about the making of ice cream through all five senses.
As for those flavors: They have cheeky names, and some are direct references to experiences at the Museum of Ice Cream. The two signature flavors are Piata, vanilla ice cream with iced animal cookies, frosted cupcake bites, fizzy cotton candies and rainbow sprinkles, and Sprinkle Pool, which contains the titular ingredient.
Theres also Vanillionaire, Chocolate Crush, Cherrylicious, the cinnamon and churro-filled Churro Churro and Nana Bread, a banana ice cream with salted caramel almond butter swirls.

West Indies payback delights Bangladesh skipper Shakib
Dhaka, Monday: Bangladesh Test skipper Shakib Al Hasan is pleased his team were able to get payback for the humiliation they suffered at the hands of the West Indies earlier this year.
Bangladesh completed a 2-0 sweep of the West Indies inside three days in Dhaka on Sunday, recording their first ever victory by an innings in the second Test. The Caribbean side recorded a few other unwanted records during the match, becoming the first side to be asked to follow-on by Bangladesh after a first innings total of 111 in Dhaka -- the lowest Test score ever recorded against Bangladesh.
It was exactly the response Shakib said he had expected from his team after losing two Tests in the West Indies in July -- by an innings and 219 runs, and by 166 runs.
Bangladesh were bowled out for 43 in the first innings in Antiguas series opener, their lowest in any Test.
I think everyone who was in West Indies did not expect that kind of performance, Shakib told reporters after second Test win on Sunday.
This is why we wanted to do something. So that people dont get us wrong. They took their home advantage, we took ours.
To be frank, I was very demanding in this series. I was looking for an extra effort from all. We had a point to prove after losing that way, said Shakib.
While West Indies had relied on the swing and pace of seamers, the Tigers used their spin-quartet to exact revenge. Bangladeshs four spinners - Shakib, Mehidy Hasan, Taijul Islam and Nayeem Hasan -- accounted for all 40 wickets, a record for a Test series in Bangladesh.
The win in the second Test was special to Shakib because it saw the twin firsts of forcing the follow-on and an innings victory. In previous 111 Tests Bangladesh had more often been on the receiving end of such drubbings, suffering defeat by an innings 38 times and following-on 15 times.
You see we played over 100 Tests. For the first time we did this (enforcing a follow-on), of course this is special, said Shakib. AFP

Williamson, Watling dig in after Yasir shines in final Test
Abu Dhabi, Monday: New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson hit a fighting half century while BJ Watling batted with patience to delay leg-spinner Yasir Shahs bid to become the fastest to 200 wickets on the first day of the third and final Test in Abu Dhabi on Monday.
Williamson missed out on a 19th Test century but Watling was unbeaten on 42 as New Zealand closed on 229-7, a measured recovery after being reduced to 72-4 by a triple strike from Yasir in the first session.
Yasir began his 33rd Test needing five wickets to become the fastest man to reach the milestone of 200 Test wickets. The record is currently 36 Tests, set 82 years ago by Australian legspinner Clarrie Grimmett.
Yasir managed 3-62 but was then thwarted by the fifth wicket stand of 104 in 249 balls between Williamson and Watling.
He failed to take any more wickets in the last two sessions and still needs another two wickets to hit the 200-mark and claim the record.
Williamson struck seven boundaries but these were the bright points in a day when defence came first.
The normally robust and aggressive Kiwi captain curbed his attacking instinct as he attmpted to carve out a first innings that might give his side some leverage in the match. The scoring rarely got above two an over.
Watling also dug in and the pair batted right through the middle session.
Williamson passed 50 in a Test for the 46th time but he was not able to convert his innings into another hundred. Having reached 89 off 176 balls, he mistimed a clip off Hasan Ali shortly after tea and found a gleeful Asad Shafiq oouching the catch at short midwicket.
Off-spinner Bilal Asif took over from Yasir, claiming Colin de Grandhomme for 20 and Tim Southee for two to finish with 2-57.
But Watling kept one end intact through his patient near-four hour batting, hitting only one boundary in his 180-ball display of self-denial.
With both teams needing a win to seal a series which is currently tied at 1-1, Yasir was the key and the leg-spinner induced a mini-collapse in the morning as the Kiwis slipped from 70-1 to 73-4 at lunch.
Yasir trapped opener Jeet Raval leg before with a faster one for 45. Raval reviewed but ball-tracking showed it would have hit leg stump.
With his next ball, Yasir clean-bowled Ross Taylor as the batsman went back but completely missed the ball.
Henry Nicholls saved the hat-trick but shortly after he attempted to sweep and Yasir flicking the ball as it went through to bowl him around his legs.
Yasir, whose 14 wickets helped Pakistan level the series in Dubai, has 25 wickets in the series so far.
It was teenage left-arm paceman Shaheen Shah Afridi, making his Test debut as a replacement for injured medium pacer Mohammad Abbas, who gave Pakistan their initial breakthrough and claim his first Test victim.
The 18-year-old nipped one back sharply to rap opener Tom Latham on the pads. Pakistan reviewed the on-field not out decision and were rewarded when ball-tracking showed the ball would have cannoned into the stumps.
New Zealand, who won the first Test by four runs in Abu Dhabi, brought in fast bowler Tim Southee and off-spinner Will Somerville in place of Neil Wagner and Ish Sodhi. AFP

World Sight Day brings much-needed eye care to underprivileged
The Brian Holden Vision Institute Foundation, a social enterprise based in Australia developing new solutions for vision care, marked World Sight Day 2018 by organising a symposium, a walk and several eye care programmes on October 11.
Brian Holden Vision Institute Chief Executive Officer and International Agency for Prevention of Blindness (IAPB), Western Pacific, Amanda Davies and Brian Holden Vision Institute Foundation Regional Director, SEAEM  Public Health, Sumrana Yasmin were in Sri Lanka to participate in the World Sight Day 2018 activities. They visited slum areas and labourers quarters at a tea factory, conducted eye clinics and gave away spectacles to those in need.
In 2004, in the aftermath of the tsunami, Professor Brian Holden, an Australian, visited Sri Lanka to replace spectacles lost in the tsunami. He saw a need for improvement of eye health at that time.
Professor Holden selected eight young persons from Deraniyagala and sent them to India to be trained as optometrists. They returned once their training was completed, to serve deserving communities.
A country office was established and registered in 2008 and programmes to help fill eye care provision gaps in the existing health care system were set in place.
The Institute opened three vision centres in the Kegalle District, at Warakapola, Yatiyantota and Deraniyagala, in 2009. The Institute also established a vision centre in the Gampaha district in partnership with the Lions Golden Jubilee Hospital, which is now owned and operated by Lions.
The Colombo Urban Comprehensive Eye Care Project 20092014, a Standard Chartered Bank Seeing is Believing initiative, was launched in selected urban slum areas of Colombo  Kolonnawa and Dehiwela. An optical workshop was also established at the National Eye Hospital which provides free spectacles to deserving beneficiaries, most of whom would not have the funds to purchase a pair of spectacles.
By establishing these models of eye care in Sri Lanka, the Institute has provided eye health services to over 99,000 people; dispensed over 54,000 pairs of spectacles; referred more than 18,000 individuals for secondary or tertiary eye care services; and conducted awareness programmes that have reached over two million community members.
The centres successfully provide culturally appropriate, good quality, affordable eye care services in Sri Lanka.
The establishment of vision centres in Sri Lanka has increased access to affordable eye care for those in need, offering sustainable eye care solutions to the large majority of the population.
The Institute targets service provision to children, the elderly and underprivileged members of the community who are often discriminated against and have limited access to services.
Human resource for eye health
To develop capacity, the Institute has invested in the tertiary education of local youths to become part of eye health workforce. Scholarships are awarded to individuals to train in India to become vision technicians and optometrists. The Institute has also supported education workshops for ophthalmic technologists, ophthalmic nurses, spectacle technicians and biomedical engineers in areas such as ophthalmic equipment repair and maintenance, spectacle lens cutting and fitting, prescribing devices for patients with low vision and low vision patient management.
To date, over 600 personnel have been trained in primary eye care and vision screening, and low vision management.
Gender equity
A key achievement of the programme is ensuring gender equity in all aspects of programme development, including empowering women for health by creating supportive services, structures, and incentives. The average ratio of women and young girls accessing eye care services at our vision centres is 56 percent  this has been achieved by integrating gender responsive strategies, training women to be their own agents of change, creating an enabling and supportive environment, and engaging the local community to build ownership for sustainability.
Moving forward
While continuing to collaborate with the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry, the Vision 2020 Secretariat, (I)NGOs, and community-based organisations, the Institute plans to scale up by increasing its geographical coverage and engagement with broader stakeholders.
The Foundations Childrens Vision Campaign is conducted in partnership with World Vision, Muslim Hands and community-based organisations.
