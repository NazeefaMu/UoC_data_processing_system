Court recalls warrant against Dhammaloka Thera
The Colombo Additional Magistrate yesterday ordered to recall a warrant issued against Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera of Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda for not appearing in Court over a private plaint filed against him for allegedly using loudspeakers causing a nuisance.
When the case came up before Additional Magistrate Dulani Amarasinghe, Dhammaloka Thera was ordered to be released on an additional surety bail of Rs.100,000. Dhammaloka Thera through his Counsel filed a motion and informed Court that he was unable to appear in Court at a previous occasion as he had been ordered to appear before Colombo High Court over another case. However, the Additional Magistrate observed that Dhammaloka Thera should have informed the difficulties through a lawyer without being unrepresented in the Magistrates Court.
Further Magisterial inquiry was put off for April 5.
On December 6, 2016, the Court had issued a conditional order preventing Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera from using loudspeakers causing a nuisance at Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m.
The Court had made this order taking into consideration a private plaint filed by six parties including former Minister Milinda Moragoda and the Centre for Environmental Justice alleging that loudspeakers used by Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka was causing an annoyance and disturbance to the residents. Through this private plaint, the six complainants sought the Courts jurisdiction to avert noise pollution taking place in the area in terms of the section 98 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
The six complainants, Gavinda Jayasinghe, Dr. Kalinga Kaluperuma, Diren R. Halok, Milinda Moragoda, Kamalesh Johnpillai and the Centre for Environmental Justice informed Court that they were compelled against their will to listen to the amplified sounds which emanate from the loudspeakers at Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple. They said the authorities turned a blind eye to their complaints made on several occasions.

Decades of wisdom
The 75th anniversary of the founding of Elpitiya Ananda Central College, the national school in the Southern part of the island, falls on March 24, 2017.
One of the significant events in British colonial Ceylon was the establishment of Ananda College, Colombo on November 1, 1886 by the Buddhist Theosophical Society. Elpitiya Ananda Central College was founded as a sister school in down south by the Buddhist Society, during the World War II after the Japanese dropped bombs in Colombo, on March 20 1942. Before that in January 1942 Ceylon was put on a war footing and Colombo city and the country had to be prepared for any contingency. Staff had to be quickly recruited, fire-fighting and emergency workers trained and equipped, and food provisions and distribution systems were established. Fire gaps, wardens posts, trenches, shelters and water tanks were constructed; buildings protected by sandbags, and emergency kitchens and hospitals had to be set up to prepare the city in the event of bombing.
On Sunday, April 5 1942, the attack on Sri Lanka (the then Ceylon) began. A fleet of Japanese aircraft raided Colombo, targeting the harbour and Ratmalana airport, followed by an attack on Trincomalee harbour. In both attacks, only a few ships were destroyed, and there were relatively few civilian casualties.
The attack on Colombo, which was short but intense, turned the city into a ghost town overnight. As soon as the raid ended, a procession of cars started moving out of Colombo by all the main roads.
Those who had bullock carts piled up their baggage, packed in their families, their worldly goods upon their heads. One-third of the population of Colombo left the city that day, some went back to their villages. The country would be kept on a war-footing for another three years until the Japanese were defeated in 1945.
As a result people who left the city needed to find a way to teach their children.
Some families settled for a short period around the Elpitiya, discussed with kind people living in the area and started a small education hut.
Great personalities
Finally it was established and situated in 11th mile post near the town. For the school a small bare land was given by Mr. Gunasekara.
Great personalities like Ven. Galuwamulle Rathanalankara Thera, S. T. Molligoda and Sembukutti Arachchige too contributed to this worthy cause. When the school was officially registered, there were only 20 students. W. Karunananda who worked in Ananda College, Colombo was appointed as the first principal. On March 30, 1955, the school was shifted to a more spacious premises at the heart of Elpitiya.
The school continued to progress with Principals such as W. Thambawita, P. Jinadasa and P. A. Somadasa who were well educated gurus in their time.
The College also became more active in national issues beyond education, a role it was to increasingly assume with the passage of time. Ananda Central College attracted an ever-expanding team of excellent teachers to add to its image. Most importantly Ananda produced a stream of educated Sri Lankans with national aspirations, proficient in local languages that went on to fill the various technical and intellectual positions in the country. Ananda Central College is a venerated national institution, with a hard-earned and unparalleled reputation among the vast majority of Sri Lankans for education and inculcation of national values.
Series of activities and programmes
Elpitiya Ananda Central College as a national school, with a student population exceeding 7,000 across 13 Grades continues to produce countless erudite scholars, professionals, and well-disciplined citizens.
The iconic Ananda Central College, the inspirational and stirring landmark of the country is today among the 50 schools that produce best exam results.
A series of activities and programmes will be held to mark the 75th anniversary of the school at an event organised by the school management, welfare society and the senior and junior past pupils.
The pinnacle event of celebration will be an all- night- Pirith ceremony under the patronage of teachers, parents and students and a three day Education Exhibition.
In addition, a variety of commemorative events - Ananda Walk, sports activities, a blood donation camp, a medical camp, scholarship schemes for needy children, connecting with retired teachers and a walk- too will be organised by the College Past Pupils Association. - Gamini Sarath Godakanda

Nadia de Los Santos, originally from India and now based in Sri Lanka, series of drawings and wall sculpture of chairs.
Most of my work prior to this dealt with the transitory nature of home; the objects and paintings created were easily portable so one could just take it with them and make the new place feel like their old one or their idea of home, states Nadia.
These are a collection of my impermanent feelings made permanent. A memento to the little things we overlook.
Mika Tennekoon, a Sri Lankan artist now completing her studies at Santiniketan in India, worked on a series of paintings on old ledger paper and board depicting Mother Earth in varying surrounding. Mika references the writing of John Trudell in her pieces - The Earth is our mother, we must take care of her.
Hanusha Somasunderam studied at the University of Jaffna and now works from her hometown Hatton. Her work is entirely dedicated to highlighting the strife of tea pluckers in the tea industry of Sri Lanka. As the child of a tea plucker her early years were spent in the nurseries of line houses.
In the body of work she uses the pay slips and compressed tea strainers as material on which she illustrates the stories.
My art is a representative of my society. A respectable wage that is still out of sight after heart breaking efforts for generations, a life without the basic human needs and a troublesome childhood with so many barriers, says Hanusha.

Exclusive: Ed Sheeran says Liberia trip 'hit me really hard'

Ed Sheeran writes exclusively for BBC News about his trip to Liberia with Comic Relief and why he'll never forget the children he met there - and one young girl in particular.
I knew I wanted to get involved in Red Nose Day this year. But then I decided to take it one step further.
I'd wanted to go on a Comic Relief trip for years and here was the perfect opportunity, so I agreed to take my first ever trip to Liberia in West Africa.
During the trip, we visited a school in West Point, the largest and most dangerous slum in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
It was really shocking seeing the appalling conditions that people live in and it was far worse than I could have ever imagined.
Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw, but despite all of this, everyone's positivity was overwhelming.
The welcome from the kids was amazing, especially when they saw my tattoos; they went nuts and couldn't understand what they were.
Some of the younger kids tried to wipe them off. Everyone wanted to know what we were doing and where we were from.
They absolutely loved singing and clapping along to my songs and for a few hours it was easy to forget that these kids live in such awful conditions.
I was completely blown away by their eagerness to learn. They really wanted to be in school and all had big dreams for the future.
Despite living in one of the poorest places on Earth, they weren't prepared to let their circumstances hold them back.
I asked a lot of them what they wanted to be when they grow up and "doctor", "teacher" and "politician" were common responses. I got a sense that they really meant it.
They've seen what life is like for people with no qualifications or jobs and it's the motivation they need to keep studying.
There are hundreds of thousands of people crammed in to West Point, most of them living in squalor, so getting an education is a privilege and not something all of the kids get to do.
As we were taking a break from filming, a little girl came over to talk to me. Her name was Peaches and unlike the other children I'd met, she wasn't in a uniform.
She explained that since her father's death during the Ebola crisis, her mother couldn't afford to send her to school any more.
At just 12 years old, she had already been working for over a year helping to support her family. Unfortunately, Peaches' story is not uncommon.
We had an impromptu jamming session and the girl could really sing. Peaches sang a song that reminded her of her father and as she did, tears started to roll down her face.
The enthusiasm that was initially shining out of her disappeared.
It was at this point that the reality of Peaches' situation, and many, many kids just like her, hit me really hard.
Peaches told me she wanted to be a musician when she grows up, and who knows, maybe she can make that happen, but for now, she has been forced to drop out of school and spends her days working in a filthy, dangerous slum, earning what she can to help feed her family.
It is because of kids like Peaches and the thousands more like her across Africa that I am relieved that Red Nose Day exists.
West Point is like a forgotten world, shut away from the rest of the civilisation, yet the money you raise in the UK is helping the kids that live there.
So many of them don't have a childhood the way you or I would recognise it: they struggle every day just to survive.
During my trip I got to visit a project that's using Comic Relief cash to help abandoned children and those not in school across Liberia.
Because of public donations, many children will be able to go back to school and get an education. For a lot of them this is their only chance of a better future and a life outside of the slum.
I've no doubt that with the right opportunities Peaches absolutely could be a singer, or a teacher, or she could very well end up running the country.
Just a small amount of money can make such a big difference in a place like West Point and at least gives these kids a fighting chance. I know this because I've seen it with my own eyes.
Just 45 could be life-changing to someone like Peaches, it could pay for a child in Liberia to go to school for a whole year.
I really hope the money we raise this Red Nose Day can help thousands of children, just like Peaches, to follow their dreams.

With an eye on Cricket World Cup 2019: Sri Lanka, Bangladesh go head to head
Sri Lanka and Bangladesh will lock horns in a three-match ODI series starting in Dambulla on Saturday with either side sweeping the series not only consolidating its position on the MRF Tyres ICC ODI Team Rankings but also strengthening its chances of qualifying automatically for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019.
Sixth-ranked Sri Lanka is on 98 points, while seventh-ranked Bangladesh is on 91 points  seven points behind.
A 3-0 win for Sri Lanka will help it gain two points and rise to 100, while Bangladesh will slip behind Pakistan on 88 points.
However, if the series result is reversed, then Bangladesh, which will aim to carry its P.Sara Stadium momentum into the ODI series, will join Sri Lanka on 96 points and be ranked in sixth place when the points are calculated beyond the decimal point.
West Indies and Pakistan will square-off in a four-match Twenty20 International series in Bridgetown on Sunday, but will be keeping a close eye on the ODI series in Sri Lanka as both are also in the danger zone. Pakistan is eighth on 89 points, while the West Indies is ninth on 84 points. The two sides will face each other in a three-match ODI series from 7-11 April in what could potentially also have a huge impact in qualification terms.
England and the seven other top teams on 30 September 2017 will qualify directly for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 with the remaining four teams getting a second chance through a 10-team ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifying tournament in 2018.
The annual MRF Tyres ICC ODI Team Rankings update will be carried out on 1 May 2017 in which results from 2013-14 will be dropped, while results from 2015-16 will be reduced to a weighting of 50 per cent.

Possible scenarios:
l Sri Lanka wins 3-0:
Sri Lanka 100, Bangladesh 88

Flemingo Duty Free receives tender at BIA
The Ministry of Transport and Aviation has successfully concluded the core category duty free tender for the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) which has been awarded to Flemingo Duty Free at 40 % revenue share .
The core category duty free contract was tendered for the first time since inception. The tender was for two spaces, one being occupied by the World Duty Free Group [WDF] and The Second by Flemingo Duty Free.
The tender was keenly contested by renowned international bidders including incumbents World Duty Free Group a Dufry Company at 36%, B & S from the Netherlands at 35%, Shilla from Korea at 34% and Aer Rianta at 28%.
The Government has achieved considerable success as their revenue share has increased from 22000000+ to almost 40,000,000 USD, an 80% increase in revenue compared to the increase in traffic of just 14%.
Reportedly as the No 2 and No 3 bidders did not qualify due to technical issues, in order to ensure that the airports maximizes revenue the Cabinet has taken a decision to retender the second space. The World Duty Free Group, has been operating the core category duty free shops at the Bandaranaike International Airport for the last 20 years. The WDF group employs around 300 employees who stand a very good chance of getting back into the airport as soon as possible. The Ministry of Transport and Aviation has already published the tender for the second space and the date of submission is the 19th of April, hence the WDF Group have a great opportunity to come back to the airport in the second tender. The Ministry has moved very quickly in a bid to ensure that the Government earns top dollars, and the employees of WDF have a very good chance of getting back into the airport.
The BIA Airport handled 9.47 million international passengers in 2016, with passenger traffic growing by 14% for the year 2016. The new airport terminal is due to be operational by 2020.

Flying high
Sitting on a bench in the shade, Jamaldeen is likely to be waiting as you arrive on Pigeon Island, a tiny piece of land off Nilaveli Beach, by boat. There is an air of the pirate about him, with his sharp eyes, adventurous look and stripy shorts.
Every morning at dawn they fly inland to the paddy fields and return at about 6 o clock in the evening, says Jamaldeen with a fond smile on his face. He is describing the hundreds of rare blue rock pigeons that nest and roost on the island. He has been travelling to the island daily since he was seventeen. He began his working life selling mangoes and pineapples on the beach, and occasionally

taking the odd tourist over to the island. He explains that at that time he barely knew any English and didnt have much of an idea what tourists wanted to see. He smiles wisely, saying, You have to be clever to deal with tourists, and enjoy explaining things. Now, he enjoys the variety of people that he gets to meet and the friends that he makes: he corresponds with one family in Somerstown, North-West London. It couldnt seem further from the landscape and seclusion of Pigeon Island.
The stress and fear
The reefs around the island are very shallow, which means that you can walk in off the beach and see blue and purple corals, colourful fish, shells, starfish, kalamari, groupers, sea snakes and turtles within seconds. Jamaldeen turns his gaze to some hollows in the sand where turtles have laid and hatched their eggs. When asked if there is a season when they come, he and his friend smile and reply, They come when they feel like it.
Jamaldeen comments that now the civil war is over, everyone feels relieved and free. During the war the fishermen could not fish at night. Previously, there were navy restrictions because the Tamil Tigers often passed through under the cover of darkness to raid boats for their engines and steal valuable petrol. On this topic, Jamaldeen and his friend explain that almost every family they know has suffered some kind of loss from the war. He describes how the Tigers would come to the villages and persuade people over the period of about a month to hand over their children in return for money. The stress and fear that they have lived under is clear in their faces. When asked if they think it is over for good they reply: We really hope so. Yet their voices are edged with in Sri Lanka one never really knows. They agree that for the time being, the return of tourism, and a horizon full of twinkling fishing boats and of course their flock of loyal blue birds is enough to be optimistic about.
A wonderful place
The fleet of R. A. F. Fighter Bombers like a stealthy sheet of wind comes into view to the strains of Wagners Ride of the Valkyries buzzing in your ears and the stunned audience of men, women and children watch shell-shocked. Feels too close to home, if you were an inhabitant of this small area during the brutal war years, what you actually witnessed wasnt some air raid blitzkrieg but the famous blue pigeons flying high again in one of their migratory transits which according to local experts of the area who have for now years observed this phenomenon that never ceases to amaze, seems to follow an irregular pattern and is more and more frequent and the birds dont seem to be perturbed by the human specs that dot their righteous path to Pigeon Island, a little off the legendary surfer paradise Nilaveli Beach in Trinco. Just make sure you spend a day on the island as it is a wonderful place to explore or just sit and be at one with nature watching the birds.
Other things to do in Trinco:
Trincomalee has been a pilgrimage site for thousands of years and home to all sorts of interesting characters. Ravanna Gate in the heart of the Koneswaram Kovil (temple) complex is a fascinating spot, as is the fort and had spectacular views of the area from it.
Also check out the town market to see the deer left behind in the 1800s by an English family who kept a pair of spotted deer as pets, because leopards where increasingly in short supply and probably not the fashion that year.
The deer couple bred and the herd escalated over the next two hundred years and has now become a familiar feature of the town.

To find a boat go to the harbor or any of the beach front hotels and ask for a good rate to Pigeon Island. Remember to haggle hard as there is no such thing a fixed rate as it goes up and down with the stock market!

The govt. must act firm
The ruckus kicked up by our disabled war heroes, at the Department of Pensions, on Thursday, should not escape the attention of the authorities, who have been condoning such unruly behaviour from these groups for far too long. First, it was the sustained protest carried out by the disabled soldiers on the busy streets of Fort and Pettah, and, then the more violent agitation near the Lotus Road roundabout, where they succeeded in breaking through police barriers, in their bid to enter the High Security Zone housing the Presidential Secretariat, ending with police teargassing the protesters.
The latest shindig assumed more serious proportions, with the protesters, in fact, succeeding in storming a government institution and causing damage to its property. They (disabled soldiers and their family members), on Thursday, broke into the Pensions Department building to protest, what they claimed was the denial of interim payments promised to the families of soldiers killed in the war and those who suffered permanent disabilities. What is more, they virtually held the Commissioner of Pensions hostage, after breaking through the police cordons. But, more seriously, accompanying the soldier families were a mob who were more vociferous than even the disabled solders who harboured a genuine grievance, clearly showing a political hand behind the whole incident. The besieged Commissioner, in the end, was forced to meekly acquiesce to the demands of the protesters, under threat of bodily harm.
True, the government is placed in a dilemma in this connection. It cannot be seen to be mistreating, or running roughshod over the disabled soldiers or the family members of the departed war heroes, given the sensitive nature of the whole affair. There is always the Joint Opposition, waiting in the wings, to pounce on the government for any harm that may befall the disabled soldiers as a result of police action, like, when one such protester was injured in the eye, following a police teargassing, at the Lotus Road incident. On that occasion, JO members summoned press conferences and paraded the injured soldier, accusing the government of being ungrateful to our war heroes. Hence, the restrain adopted by the government, whenever demonstrations featuring the war heroes are staged.
However, this kid glove treatment appears to be wearing thin, with the agitators getting emboldened, and improving on their last act, as seen by the intensity of Thursday's protest, where outsiders too were co-opted into the project. It was indeed sad that the Pensions Commissioner was left to the mercy of the mob, with even the police showing a reluctance to act firmly.
It is time that the government took a firm decision. It cannot allow mob rule to hold sway. Besides, the issues confronting the disabled war heroes were not the makings of the Yahapalanaya Government, but a legacy of the Rajapaksa regime. But, no agitations were held at the time by these disabled soldiers to win their demands. Like the GMOA, and the Anti-SAITM brigade, whose grievances date back to the Rajapaksa era, the disabled soldiers, too, have picked up the threads and are going hammer and tongs against the Sirisen-Wickremesinghe government with a clear intent of boosting the political fortunes of their mentors.
The government cannot afford to have mobs breaking into its departments and threatening its officials. It should act with resolve to ensure the fate that befell the Pensions Commissioner will not visit another official. The disabled soldiers may have made great sacrifices on behalf of the country and paid with their limbs. But that should not give them a license to run amok and challenge the government's authority. The Police should be given the go ahead to halt the trouble makers in their tracks before they storm government buildings with the mob and cause damage to state property.
For too has the government adopted the soft approach vis a vis protest demos of disabled soldiers. Not only that, it should also expose the political hand that is guiding these elements.
Police protection for girls schools
The incident where a group of Big-Match revellers stormed a girls  school and ran amok, scuffling with teachers, and, chasing after female students, should open the eyes of both the education authorities and the law enforcement, to find ways to rein in Big Match miscreants. In the aftermath of the incident, the IGP had taken special measures to forestall a repetition, such as placing police security near selected girls schools that are vulnerable and also organising special mobile patrols. While the measures are to be appreciated, police protection granted to a girl's school, as a result of an external threat, must be a first in this country. Besides, the measure is also reflective of the helplessness of the authorities of the boy's schools involved in Big Matches in disciplining their charges, a sort of abdication of their responsibility, now being transferred to the police, although a majority of these schools are considered among the elite ones.

Hambantota Port Agreement runs into another glitch
The Hambantota Port Agreement will face yet another obstacle before being signed as State Minister for Finance Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena yesterday said that the agreement could not be signed without amendments made to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act No 51 of 1979.
If signed without amendments to the Act, the agreement would be illegal, said Abeywardena.
Addressing a media briefing at the Ministry of Finance, State Minister Abeywardena explained that the Cabinet, consisting of both the UNP and SLFP had thus far agreed on a basic framework which included proposals from the SLFP.
Cabinet on Tuesday also granted approval to set up a cabinet sub-committee chaired by Minister of Special Assignments, Sarath Amunugama to oversee the implementation of the agreement. According to Abeywardena, the committee would look at the various loopholes in the agreement and ensure that it is something that would also keep to the vision and principles of the SLFP. One such loophole they found was that, Around 700acres of land at the Port have not been valued.
We have asked for the Government Valuation Department to value it. he said.
The SLFP as a party has stated that they would not support privatization of government entities but given the ground realities of the economy, the State Minister of Finance said they were open to public private partnerships.
The government cannot become auctioneers, we are not Schokman and Samarawickrema, stressed Abeywardena but added that the government was keen on coming to a common agreement on the Hambantota Port soon, If we can resolve this issue amicably, the government would have proven to investors that the two parties can work together in government and this would encourage future investments.
The Hambantota Port Agreement with the Chinese company, China Merchant Port Holdings Company Limited is a joint venture with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) where 80 percent stake of the Port is to be given to China at USD 1.12 billion. The current framework agreement allows the SLPA to buy back a further 20 percent stake in the venture after 10 years of operation, taking the Sri Lankan stake at the Port to 40 percent.

Implementation of Land Development Ordinance of 1935 in major irrigation settlement schemes: Land laws & woes
The State aided peasant settlement has a considerable history in Sri Lanka, the earliest experiments in the later period being in the latter parts of the 19th century. However, it became fully accepted policy only in the 1930s, after the granting of universal suffrage and the limited government under the Donoughmore Commission of 1931. This became a popular rural development strategy during the pre and post Independence eras, in terms of State interventions on land and irrigation infrastructure development.
The land alienation which ultimately led to creation of human settlements was done under different types of schemes such as major settlement schemes, village expansion schemes, highland settlement schemes, middle class schemes, youth settlement schemes and regularization of encroachments. Among the various types of settlements major settlement schemes known as irrigated settlements or major colonization were subjected to more debate than other schemes, due to their contribution to society and economy of the country.
The initial objectives expected to be achieved from major settlement schemes through the Land Development Ordinance of 1935 were (a) protecting peasant farmers as a group (b) alleviating land hunger among the poorest of the poor (c) relieving population pressure of the villagers in the wet zone of the country, (d) increasing food production particularly paddy (e) developing the scarcely populated dry zone. Some of the more recent objectives were (a) generating hydro power (b) promoting industries and (c) promoting exports.
This article draws partly on the evaluation of the findings of various socio-economic and agrarian studies conducted by researchers and recognized research institutions such as Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute on such topics as Land policy, fragmentation, encroachment on State land, informal land transactions and profitability of irrigated paddy sector, in the context of the Land Development Ordinance (LDO) of 1935 within the sphere of major irrigation settlement schemes.
A brief overview
The tenure under the Land Development Ordinance at the beginning provided for the lease of State land to an allottee in perpetuity on a restricted tenure.
The allottee could not fragment the land, mortgage the land or dispose of it without Government Agents permission. The tenure was liable to cancellation for any default. The allottees land was therefore a protected holding which could not be mortgaged, leased or sold or cannot be seized by a Court of Law.
The first major amendment to the LDO was made in 1969 by the Land Development (Amendment) Act of 1969. The main purpose of the Amending legislation in 1969 was to confer the ownership of the allotment alienated under LDO to the allottee. Under the LDO of 1935 the allottee held his allotment under an entailed lease perpetuity.
Under the provisions of the LDO as amended, alienation under the Ordinance has been effected in three stages instead of in two stages as at earlier. On selection at a Land Kachcheri every allottee is in the first instance be entitled to receive a permit authorizing him to occupy the land. With this permit he is required to pay an annual rent which is a nominal sum.
He is required to develop his allotment during this period under close government supervision. These conditions require an allottee to pay to the Government a prescribed amount in annual installment  instead of rent for a specified period. In fixing this scale of payment the government takes account of the improvements effected to the land with the assistance of the State.
When the permit holder has duly paid all these instalment he is entitled to receive a grant of his allotment.
The grantee is able to freely dispose of his allotment without the consent of the Government. However, The LDO requires peasant holder to obtain the prior consent of the Government Agent before disposal. The restriction has been designed to prevent the passing of land intended for the peasantry to the richer classes or high income groups. The owner of a holding may also not lease his holding except in such circumstances as may be prescribed.
The holder of a grant may not mortgage his holding to any person other than the Agricultural and Industrial Credit Corporation of Ceylon or Peoples Bank or the Ceylon State Mortgage Bank or a Registered Co-operative society or other prescribed institutions. Amendments have been made to the Agricultural and Industrial Credit Co-operation Ordinance and the Peoples Bank Act No.29 of 1961 to enable those institution to lend money to owners of holdings alienated under the Land Development Ordinance.
The provisions in the Amended procedure ensure that in future no person may be nominated as the successor by the owner of a holding or a permit holder unless that person is the spouse of such owner or permit holder or belongs to one of the groups of relatives enumerated in the Ordinance. This restriction has been imposed with a view to creating something in the nature of an entailed and preserving the allotment as far as possible in the family.
A permit holder is now given the right of nominating more than one successor provided that such nomination does not contravene the conditions of his permit with regard to fragmentation. A nomination made by the permit holder who on the date of making such nomination was unmarried, will upon marriage of such permit holder, be null and void.
This provision has been introduced to meet the cases of hardship caused to permit holders and owners who have forgotton to change their nominations on marriage.
Hitherto the right of a nominated successor to succeed to land held on a permit or grant was given precedence over all others including the spouse of the deceased permit holder or owner.
Under the Amended legislation, the surviving spouse is given the right of immediate succession in every case. The nominated successor is only entitled to succeed on the failure of such spouse to succeed or on the re-marriage or death of such a spouse. Where a spouse succeeds by operation of law, such spouse will have no power to dispose of the land or to nominate a successor thereto. A spouse who succeeds as nominated successor however, will succeed to all the rights of the deceased permit holder or owner like any other nominated successor. A spouse who succeeded otherwise than as a nominated successor will lose his or her right on the land on re-marriage.
Discrimination against female spouses who succeed to land under the LDO is found both in the legislative scheme for succession and according to the findings of empirical research in the practice of the LDO. The situation of surviving spouses being deprived of their full legal rights to succeed to State land also appears to be the result of an unfortunate combination of unnecessarily complex legislation, incomplete erroneous transferring of such legislation into guidance for officials and selective implementation even of such guidance as revealed in the empirical studies. Where there has been a breach of the conditions of a permit, State authorities are empowered to impose a fine in the first instance. The cancellation of the permit will only be resorted to where the permit holder fails to pay the fine or where there is further contravention of the conditions of the permit.
The time given to a permit holder to show cause has also been extended. The State authorities can institute proceedings against any person who encroaches on land which has been alienated and for the punishment and summary removal of such encroachers. There was no legal bar earlier to the alienation of land under the Ordinance to a non- citizen although in practice alienation has been confined in the vast majority of cases to Sri Lankans.
The LDO as amended ensures that no State land shall be alienated to any person other than citizens of Sri Lanka and declaring that any alienation made in contravention of this provision shall be invalid. The Ordinance amended also provides that selection may be made only from such class of persons as may be prescribed.
Land policy
The Land Commission of 1927 appointed by the then Governor, Sir Hugh Clifford, which highlighted the harsh consequences caused by the Crown Land Encroachment Ordinance of 1840 and Wasteland Ordinance of 1897 recommended, (a) the planning of peasant settlement scheme (b) formulation of policies for mapping- out land, land tenure, land alienation, disposition and succession and related aspects.
The Land Commission of 1927 also declared that State land must be held by the government in trust, for the whole people inhabiting the country and the State land should be allocated according to the interests of the community. This declaration in the Land Commission of 1927 created the precedence for the subsequent attempts at establishing major settlement schemes, then known as colonization schemes in the Dry zone under the concept peasant propertorship. In order to give effect to the above purposes, the Land Development Ordinance No.19 of 1935 (LDO) was enacted.
One important provision of the LDO is related to tenure. The Ordinance provides a method of alienating State land on a restricted tenure.
The intent of these conditions was to protect the newly settled farmers from a loss of their land to more resourceful interests which might purchase such lands or obtain it through many lending activities which really have occurred. The LDO backed by the Land Commission of 1927 placed the preservation of peasantry the first and the foremost obligation. The type of tenure, which defines the user rights determines the household behaviour indicating the level of investing, productivity improvement and resources conservation, technical use, returns and income from the land.
The nature of economic activities conducted on holdings, returns increased and the level of household consumption costs and cash savings may be more important considerations for the settler as an investor, in determining economic improvements than security. Yet from the view point of utilization of a public resources, the relationship of settler economic activities with the legal tenure of settlement warrants a deeper investigation particular when viewed against the longstanding policy expectation of a prosperous settler multitude a higher contribution to the domestic food supply through settler endeavours and conservation of land resources for future users of the nation.
As correctly stated by the Land Commission of 1987, the key terms of State land and alienation summarized to a large extent the entire field of land policy in Sri Lanka not only during the colonial period but also during the independent era.
As it also correctly appeared to the Land Commission of 1987, the emphasis had somewhat shifted away from State ownership to State trust. Therefore the Land Commission of 1987made it clear that any government would therefore be falling short of its duty if it neglects such a trust.
As the Land Commission of 1987 noted, the policy of state aided colonization and alienation of land under village expansion, highland settlements, middle  class schemes made significant progress since national independence.
In spite of certain positive aspects like such as peasant settlement and village expansion in unoccupied lands under State ownership, there were also more negative aspects such as the widespread problems of landlessness, large scale encroachment of State land and the restrictive nature of land market.
Although the settler should have holdings of similar size, with equal subsidies and institutional facilities, economic and social differentiation began to take place once production had begun.
The idea of creating a homogenous class of contended peasantry remain therefore unfulfilled. Thus, although disposal and fragmentation of land were prohibited by law, de facto transfer and parcelization of allotments cannot be prevented. As a result of this polurlazation process, the unequal agrarian structure began to appear in the major settlement schemes after the establishment.
As the economic development of the country on modern lines proceeds, the conditions to which peasant had been accustomed for generations are radically altered often in the pace of few years.
Naturally conservative and often inprovident, the peasant is slow to adopt himself to the new economic environment which has come into existence around while he has proved himself in many cases only too ready to part with his land. In these circumstances, unless special steps are taken for his protection, there is serious danger of this class going to a worse position. As a change under which the mass of peasant becomes landless labour class is prejudicial to the interest of the whole community, it is necessary to consider whether means cannot be devised to check this process and preserve peasant as a small land owner till such time he become stronger to meet the challenges of polarlization process. Accordingly following conclusions can be made.

Inaugural National Kids Athletics Competition 2017: Sports a part of primary education in Sri Lanka
The inaugural National Kids Athletics Competition 2017 sponsored by the Nestle Lanka PLC will be worked off in two phases, on March 25 (grade three) at the Maris Stella College, Negombo and on March 30 (grade four) at the Rathnapura Public Ground with the participation of around 3000 students representing 74 Zones. This was revealed to the media during a press briefing headed by the Education Minister Akhila Viraj Kariyawasam at the JAIC Hilton, Colombo recently.
The Education Ministry has launched this programme, based on the Four F concept, Fun, Fitness, Fundamental and Friendship to provide much needed physical activities to the children of 9, 10 and 11 years old, the age categories identified as the best stages to enhance ones physical capabilities.
This will also serve as a talent search where sporting skills of children will be recognized at a tender age, so they can be directed in the respective sporting disciplines from the beginning.
The Kids Athletics team sports programme was initiated in 2015 focusing primary students in grade 3, 4 and 5. In 2016 competitions were conducted in 222 divisions, 74 Zones and six Provinces with the participation of 175,000 students. Winning schools of Zonal level representing all provinces will be seen in action at the fist ever national level competitions.
Explaining the two-day programme, Education Ministrys Project Officer Milroy Jayamanne said that the first day (March 25) event for grade three students will have around 2000 children competing in five team events under the watchful eyes of 125 officials while the Rathnapura event for grade four students will include 1000 children competing in seven team events with 167 officials.
There is no mechanism in pre-schools for physical activities. But now we are going to implement this new initiative, Kids Athletics with a scientific approach at primary school level.
We have also taken steps to allocate 25 minutes daily for fun activities in school time tables island-wide. We hope to introduce Kids Athletics programme to each and every school in 2017, covering all 98 zones as this will be the foundation for future national sports, Jayamanne concluded.
Special Advisor to the Education Ministry on Sports, Sunil Jayaweera elaborating the importance of this programme thanked Nestle Lanka for stepping into shoulder this task, apart from their seven other commitments to school sports. Jayaweera said that around 2,000,000 out of the total number of 4,500,000 school student population are between 5 to 13 years of age and in almost every country, Kids Athletics programme has become mandatory for 5 to 13 years-old students.
We want to spread this programme to all schools in the country as this will be the base for future sporting champions. It is essential to identify sporting talent at a tender age and provide them with good techniques and guidance from the start to produce an international champion, he explained.
Education Ministry secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi praised Nestle Lanka for their contribution for school sports over the past 30 years and said that with the new reforms to Sri Lankan education system, sports has been recognized as a vital aspect of character building and well being of a person.
So we want to encourage all students to take up to sports. As we are aiming at 2024 Olympics we have to focus on young generation who will be greatly benefited by this kind of programmes, he said.
Nestle Lanka PLC Managing Director Shivani Hegde told that they are happy to be stakeholders of this programme while strengthening their long term partnership with school sports.
We have launched a programmed in 2010 to raise awareness among school children on nutrition which became a great success and now we consider this Kids Athletics programme a big leap in school sports, Shivani stated.
Education Minster Akhila Viraj Kariyawasam in his speech emphasized the importance of sports in education system as it play a vital role in moulding a well balanced citizen. Flexibility, balance, teamwork, perseverance, leadership, quick decision making are some qualities which sports has in abundance and also key ingredients of a making a great citizen.
With that in mind, we have introduced many reforms to our education system. We are no more an exam centralized education system. With this kind of programmes we want to see a progressive movement in our education system. We are into a five-year programme to revolutionize our education system, the minister revealed.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, the film, an adaptation of Seth Harps Rolling Stone articleThe Anarchists vs the Islamic State, will see the actor reunite with director Daniel Espinosa, with whom he recently worked on sci-fi horror movie Life. Gyllenhaal will produce the film via his production company Nine Stories.
Published last month, the Rolling Stone article tells the real-life story of a group of US radicals, volunteers and outcasts who have teamed up with Kurdish militia the Peoples Protection Units to fight Isis inSyria, with the ultimate aim of establishing an anarchist collective in the region.
Life is released this week and stars Gyllenhaal as an astronaut battling a parasitic organism aboard a spaceship. Ryan Reynolds also stars. The film has received mixed reviews, with the Guardians Peter Bradshaw calling it a a serviceable, watchable, determinedly unoriginal film.
Promoting the film in an interview with the Guardian last week, Gyllenhaal expressed annoyance over questions relating to a past relationship with Taylor Swift. There are some things I keep to myself, that are my business ... I would love to not talk about my personal life, he said.

On winning the toss Kamindu Mendis invited Maliyadewa to take first lease of the wicket.

London attack: Khalid Masood identified as killer

Police have identified Khalid Masood as the man who carried out the Westminster attack, as the death toll rose to five.
Masood, 52, was born as Adrian Elms in Kent and was shot dead by police. He had not been the subject of any current police investigations.
PC Keith Palmer, 48, Aysha Frade and US tourist Kurt Cochran, 54, were killed on Wednesday, while a 75-year-old man died on Thursday evening.
The so-called Islamic State group has said it was behind the attack.
Three women and five men were arrested in London and Birminghamon suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts following Wednesday's attack.
A woman aged 39 was arrested in east London
A 21-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man were arrested in Birmingham
A 26-year-old woman and three men aged 28, 27 and 26 were arrested at another address in Birmingham
A man aged 58 was arrested at an address in Birmingham
The Met Police says detectives are continuing to search a number of addresses, including one in Carmarthenshire, three in Birmingham and one in east London. Addresses in Brighton and south-east London have also been searched.
'We will defeat them'
Home Secretary Amber Rudd told those gathered for a candlelit vigil in London's Trafalgar Square on Thursday evening that terrorists "will not win".
"We are all connected and today we showed that by coming together, by going to work, by getting about our normal business, because the terrorists will not defeat us. We will defeat them," she said.
Masood drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before crashing his car into railings and then running into the grounds of Parliament, armed with a knife.
He stabbed PC Palmer before being shot dead.
The Metropolitan Police said there had been no prior intelligence about Masood's intention to carry out an attack.
But he was known to the police and his previous convictions included causing grievous bodily harm, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences. He was believed to have been living in the West Midlands.
Masood is believed to have lived at various times in Crawley, West Sussex, and Rye and Eastbourne, both in East Sussex.
He also appears to have been convicted of a knife crime in 2003 in Eastbourne.
His first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last in December 2003 for possession of a knife.
He had not been convicted of any terrorism offences.
Car hire company Enterprise said the vehicle used in the attack had been rented from its Spring Hill depot in Birmingham.
The BBC understands Masood hired the Hyundai SUV in person, giving his profession as a teacher.
The Department for Education said it had no record of him having worked as a qualified teacher in English state schools.
It appears that he styled himself as an English tutor at one point.
People gathered in Trafalgar Square stood together quietly, flanked by police officers with the sound of helicopters a constant presence above.
The people of London and visitors to the city came together to remember the people who lost their lives in Wednesday's attack. The word "solidarity" was heard over and over again.
Candles were laid on the floor and on the steps leading to the National Gallery, waiting to be lit in memory of those who died.
As the bells of St Martin's in the Fields chimed, the crowds fell silent and paused to think about Wednesday's events.
Some filmed the scene on their phones, some cast glances across the crowds, but the focus was on the candles on the steps leading up to the National Gallery, above which MPs, religious figures and others stood in a line to pay their respects.
'Business as usual' for defiant Londoners
PC Palmer, who was stabbed in the grounds of Parliament, was a father.
He was an unarmed member of the parliamentary and diplomatic protection squad, with 15 years' service.
His family said in a statement that he would be remembered as a "wonderful dad and husband".
'Brave and courageous'
They also described him as "a loving son, brother and uncle. A long-time supporter of Charlton FC. Dedicated to his job and proud to be a police officer, brave and courageous. A friend to everyone who knew him.
"He will be deeply missed. We love him so much.
"His friends and family are shocked and devastated by his loss and ask that they are left to grieve alone in peace."
A JustGiving page set up for the family of PC Palmer reached its initial target of 100,000 on Thursday afternoon, less than 24 hours after it had been set up.
The amount pledged has now passed 320,000, after the target was raised several times.
The Met said that as a mark of respect, the constable's shoulder number, 4157U, would be retired and not reissued to any other officer.
Frade worked at a London college, while Cochran was from Utah, in the US, and had been visiting the capital with his wife Melissa, who is in hospital with serious injuries.
According to a family statement, the Cochrans had been celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary and were due to return to the US on Thursday.
Frade and Cochran were killed on Westminster Bridge.
Frade worked at a London sixth-form college, just a few hundred metres from the bridge.
The principal at DLD College, Rachel Borland, said she was "highly regarded and loved by our students and by her colleagues".
In other developments:
The Queen said her "thoughts, prayers, and deepest sympathy" were with those affected by the "awful violence"
MPs held a minute's silence before Parliament continued business as normal
Prime Minister Theresa May spent 40 minutes visiting the injured in hospital
People worried about family and friends can call the police casualty bureau on: 0800 056 0944 or 0207 158 0010. Anyone with images or footage of the incident can send them to ukpoliceimageappeal.co.uk
Police have said five people remain in a critical condition in hospital and two have life-threatening injuries.
A total of about 40 people had been treated in hospital, police said.
A Romanian couple injured in the attack have been identified as Andrei Burnaz and Andreea Cristea. The Romanian embassy in London has confirmed that Ms Cristea is the person who fell from Westminster Bridge during the attack.
The casualties also included 12 Britons, three French children -who have since returned home -, four South Koreans, one German, one Pole, one Irish, one Chinese, one Italian, one American and two Greeks.

Love & Majesty
It was in 1947, that a union that could be described as the best, the rarest and the one with the perfect fairy tale ending took place: a royal love match.
She was thirteen when she first set her eyes on him. The day she and her parents, toured the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth an 18-year-old blond naval cadet was assigned to escort her around. Obviously something clicked. Soon the two were writing letters; she kept a framed photo of him by her bed.
And it wasn't as though there weren't enough number of suiters she could choose from. "There was a whole battalion of lively young men," recalled Lady Anne Glenconner, a family friend. But she "realized her destiny and set her heart on him at an early age. He was ideal-good-looking..."
So handsome was he that some called him "A blond Greek Apollo"; "a Viking;" "handsome as any film star," but alas, he was also "unpolished," arrogant, destitute, and-perhaps worst of all for a country just emerging from World War Two-he was "too German."
As Nancy Bilyeau writes in 'The Story of Queen Elizabeth's Wedding,' 'there was no getting around it: he was of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glucksberg. While he'd been taken in by English relatives in his youth, his four sisters all married German princes. Three of his brothers-in-law joined the Nazi party.' And so, her mother was not too sure about having him as her son-in-law. In private she called him "the Hun."
Yet they persevered. Through letters and occasional moments together, he courted her. In 1946 when Prince Philip of Greece, proposed in Scotland, Princess Elizabeth II, said yes. But that is when their romance turned tricky.
Her father, King George, insisted the couple wait to announce their engagement until his 'Lilibet,' barely 20, was older. Within an year, however, the romance of the attractive young couple won the necessary hearts. The wedding date was set for 20th November 1947. The only obstacle that remained was money. In the aftermath of the Second World War, Britain still had food rationing, and exercised controls on imports of petrol, tobacco, and paper.
Amazingly, with the clothing coupons she saved Princess Elizabeth managed to wear a dress that was breathtakingly beautiful: an ivory silk wedding gown sewn with thousands of seed pearls. On her feet, she wore ivory duchess satin high heels, embellished with silver and pearls. The-star patterned bridal train was 13 feet in length. Rumor had it the dress was inspired by a Botticelli painting from 1482.
In contrast to his beaming bride to be, Philip, by then called the Duke of Edinburgh, always indifferent to clothes and fond of economizing, simply wore his naval uniform and reportedly wore darned socks on his wedding day.
As with every wedding, there were a few mishaps too. On the way to the ceremony, Princess Elizabeth's diamond tiara (which can also be worn as a necklace), originally made for Queen Mary in 1919 and borrowed by the princess from her mother for the wedding, snapped and the court jeweler had to be summoned to make the necessary repairs.
This was the wedding of the future monarch of Britain, so anonymity was out of the question. The ceremony was broadcast on the radio to millions of listeners, and there were 2,500 guests at Westminster, including six kings and seven queens. The wedding cake itself was a grand affair, standing at nine-foot high, weighing 500 pounds and featuring four tiers. Made from ingredients received from the Australian Girl Guides, the cake was cut using Philip's sword.
Here's how Lady Pamela Hicks, one of the eight bridesmaids who carried white orchids, lilies of the valley, gardenias and white roses on that magical day, recalls the events of that morning. "Princess Elizabeth with her marvellous complexion and Prince Philip such a devastatingly handsome naval officer. He looked tender, she was adoring. They really were a dream couple."
From that day on, they have been living 'happily ever after' for 69 years. Here's wishing them many more years of majestic bliss.

Maliban Smart Cream Cracker has been awarded the Advertisement of the Year at the recently concluded SLIM-Nielsen People's Awards 2017 held at Water's Edge.
This was testimony to disruptive communication creating a lasting connect with consumers. When developing this idea for Maliban Smart Cream Cracker, the task was indeed a difficult one. We needed to make a strong impression with the target segment in a category that is very competitive. Using disruption , our approach was to look beyond the conventions of the category and use a strong consumer insight. This has certainly paid off with this award, said Subhash Pinnapola, Chief Creative Officer, TBWAi Lanka We are honoured to have received such a recognition, especially given the category of communication where competition isn't just with biscuits but much larger.
This recognition drives home the fact that good communication makes a difference not only in growing market share but also the importance of touching the hearts of Sri Lankans said Kasun Thotagamuwa, Category Manager, Maliban Biscuits. A commercial to be voted by the people, as the most popular advertisement of the year is an honour. It is a testimony that we at TBWAi Lanka understand and resonate with our people. Consumers today are bombarded with so many brands and messages. To get their attention and share of heart with the Maliban Smart Cream Cracker Anduna Gaththada Manda commercial is indeed a proud moment said Renuka Marshall, Managing Director TBWAi Lanka.

Negative impact on domestic industries due to China-Sri Lanka FTA
A group of local industrialists have expressed strong concerns over the proposed China - Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement; pointing out that the FTA could have serious and detrimental effects on the countrys domestic industries, if implemented.
The Association of Laminated Flexible Packaging Manufacturers, a body of local entrepreneurs representing the packaging industry, stated in a media release, that if implemented, the proposed agreement will have an adverse impact on the domestic industrialists leading to the collapse of a large number of industries. This will result in loss of jobs and livelihoods and inevitable economic chaos.
The Association points out that most industrialists are unaware of this grave danger and urges all domestic industrialists to unite and safeguard their industries and businesses.
The proposed Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Sri Lanka and China became a serious concern for the local industrialists when the government recently disclosed the requirement to reduce the Sri Lanka negative list to 10% as opposed to the 30% initially agreed upon. Furthermore, the governments requirement to phase out the import CESS (a tax imposed to safeguard local industries) within 5 years of implementing the FTA adds to the worry. As local industrialists point out, the potential free entry of Chinese goods like tsunami waves will force domestic industries into closure.
Speaking about the issue, President of the Association of Laminated Flexible Packaging Manufacturers, Anton Hemantha said, Local industrialists have been a solid force in stabilizing the countrys economy throughout the toughest of times. The sweat and tearsthey shed over the last few decades built successful local industries and created thousands of employment opportunitieswithin Sri Lankas economy. We strongly oppose the signing of FTA with a 10% negative list as indicated by the recent agreement with china but urge to cover the original 30% negative list as agreed earlier.
Unlike large economies that enjoy benefits of economies of scale, local industrialists already struggle with multiple challenges such high energy costs, high labor costs, bloated raw material costs and Sri Lankas lack of economic fundamentals to develop and safeguard the local industries. The majority of the local industrialists have invested all their assets in their respective industries for borrowings. Their bank loans and overdrafts run into millions and as such their collapse will certainly lead to disastrous economic situations.
The packaging industry together with other local industrialists strongly urge the government to consider the potential disastrous impact FTA could impose on local industries and take measures to safeguard them.

New programme with Australia, Word Bank to enhance trade and private sector competitiveness
The World Bank announced today a technical assistance and advisory programme with the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade (MODSIT) to enhance the competitiveness of the private sector and unleash the potential of Sri Lankan exports.
The program aims to address the most significant obstacles to the creation of new private enterprises and the growth of existing ones; the attraction of efficiency-seeking foreign direct investment (FDI) into the country; and the growth of higher added-value exports. Ultimately, the program responds to the vision of the GoSL to facilitate the transformation of the economy through exports and private sector growth. In turn, thriving and competitive private enterprises are expected to be the source of new jobs, the statement read.
Under this collaboration, the Government of Australia has made available 6 million Australian Dollars that will enable the provision of technical assistance by the World Bank to MODSIT and other public sector stakeholders on areas including improvement of the investment climate; enhancement of the ability to attract FDI; elimination of policy and regulatory barriers to trade; development of export-oriented Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and high-growth start-ups; and sustainable and inclusive growth of the Tourism sector. In particular, through this program the most significant regulatory, procedural and institutional obstacles will be identified and the relevant authorities will receive assistance to implement necessary reforms.

## Title: Not so 'free' Education

Not so 'free' Education
Much public attention has been focused on education these days. Perhaps controversy over and agitation on the SAITM medical faculty would have contributed to this situation. Obviously the latter agitation is intrinsically woven with much broader and deeper issues pertaining to education. Besides educating ones offspring is a high priority among all Sri Lankans, including the most humble as it is perhaps the only means of moving up the social ladder.
The most articulated demand among the public is for free education. Yet what is free education Judging by the demand and its justification free education seems to be a misnomer for it is used as a synonym for education free of charge. Yet they are not synonyms.
There is also another view which equates free education with State or State-funded education. Incidentally there is no education free of charge today. Although State schools provide free education parents have to bear more than half the financial burden of educating their children. Facilities and other fees plus an innumerable number of ad hoc contributions cost them dear. Besides they have to pay tuition fees for extra classes outside the school.
Added to this situation is the proliferation of fee-levying private schools which absorb a considerable number of children of school-going age. Pre-school education is entirely in the private sector. In tertiary education only about 16 percent of those qualified gets admitted to State Universities. There is a plethora of tertiary education institutes offering for a price almost every discipline except medicine.
Sound education
Even if the State funds the entire cost of educating a child it still will fall short of free education.
Freedom and education are two inseparably linked concepts. Education could thrive only in an atmosphere of freedom. Coercion, compulsion of any sort hinders development of creativity which is a goal of education. Education should be free of all myths and fallacies. It should be scientific. How can education that inculcates in children blind faith and obedience to natural and supernatural forces be free Apart from any possible psychological benefits, what pedagogic value is there in talismans, Bodhi poojas and other spiritual blessings
Education is a human right. It is the duty of the State to ensure that every child gets a sound education that is necessary to lead a good life. Whether it is funded by the State or not, it is the responsibility of the State to ensure this right.
Historically speaking education was a prerogative of the rich or the rulers in early stages of human society. It was either confined to the Brahmins as in India or the slave owners as in Greece. It is only with the development of productive forces that education began to spread wider. Public education as we see today is a result of capitalist development which needed educated personnel for its factories and offices. The much talked about Kannangara education reform also should be seen in this light. A little bit of reflection would show that the Kannangara reform was stalled half-way. It did not proceed or expand. It is primarily a shortcoming of the warped development of capitalism in our country.
National education policy
Now, let us have a look at the content and quality of education. Although we are approaching the 70th anniversary of independence we have failed to formulate a national education policy. Tinkering with policies continues with every change of government or even when different Ministers take over the subject of education within a single Government. The only consistence seems to be the movement towards shifting the burden of education more to parents according to the advice of international financial agencies, primarily the IMF and the World Bank.
The lack of equity in educational opportunities is tremendous despite the rosy pictures presented by Ministers and officials. Out of around 10,000 public schools with a student population of 440,000 only 350 have facilities to study Science for the Advanced Level examination. While the State has confined the majority of students to the Arts stream Ministers and public officials decry Arts graduates in public. Most of these critics themselves have only Arts qualifications or no higher educational qualification. Ironically some of the most vociferous critics are those that have excelled in public service through Arts of Humanities education. There cannot be a far outrageous injustice.
We often say lament our failure to evolve a national identity and achieve national unity and reconciliation. Yet have we pondered why we have not used education to inculcate values of national unity and reconciliation through education On the other hand, the content of education we have imparted to the estrangement of national communities, especially through inaccurate or false interpretations of history or neglect of national culture and its traditions.
Quality of school education
There is a Chinese proverb which says that it takes only one person to plant a tree, one village to plant a forest but one needs the whole society to educate one child. This saying graphically illustrates the responsibility of the society for national education.
It also underlines the need for a holistic approach to education. Especially the needs of the economy should be considered in educational planning and education should provide at least the minimum human resources required for the development of the economy. Our failure to take such an approach has produced many incongruities where for example honors graduates in Agriculture have taken up managerial positions in commercial firms while there is a dearth of Agricultural specialists and researchers.
Another example of lack of holistic planning is the dearth of forensic experts and medical specialists in Geriatrics in a society in which crime as well as longevity of life are increasing.
There is also much to be desired in the quality of education. Best talents do not enter the education fields. Most of those who enter it also consider teaching only as a stepping stone to enter another more lucrative employment. The majority of teachers are disillusioned over poor pay, which is the lowest in our region. The private tuition menace is a result of this poor pay and the poor quality of school education.

JO boycotting SC meeting: MP Dinesh Gunawardena strongly refutes media reports
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday in Parliament, strongly refuted reports that the Joint Opposition had boycotted the Steering Committee meetings.
He said the JO had been attending the Steering Committee meetings right through as much as possible.
While making this clarification, the MP also called on the Chair to investigate as to who had provided the wrong information to the media.
He pointed out that the JO was represented by two members in the 21 member Steering Committee chaired by the Prime Minister. There had been so many meetings where the two JO MPs had not been present. I attended it . Yesterday, I had to attend a public meeting of former President Mahinda Rajapaska, he explained.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella also supporting the assertion of MP Gunawardena, said participation of the Steering Committee was highly satisfactory. The JO has been participating regularly. This is the first time in the post-independence history that all political parties are involved in the Constitutional making. This is the first time that the Tamil parties are taking part actively. This is a golden opportunity and we should make use of it. Wrong reports set fire to the constitutional making process. They are trying to destroy the country, he said.
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala noted that the Prime Minister as the head of the Steering Committee could issue a statement to the media explaining the real situation.
The 99 year land lease: We must not let our country be subject to foreign pressure: Justice Minister
Justice Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday in Parliament, raised his concerns over the proposed 99 year lease of the Hambantota Port lands.
Speaking at the debate yesterday, the minister said the 99 year lease was a serious issue that should not be taken lightly. We should have a consistent land policy in the country. Ninety nine years means three generations.
What would happen to our lands at the end of this period We cannot wash our hands and steer clear of this move, while justifying it just because we are in the Government. I am not ready to be nave like that.
This Parliament should discuss this issue at length.
Pointing fingers at either former President Mahinda Rajapaksa or President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is not going to help. The rights of our people could not be betrayed just because we want dollars. We have to safe guard their rights. These are lands our ancestors protected for over 2,500 years risking their lives.
We should not let our country subject to foreign pressure. Foreign countries are interested only about the economic benefits they receive, he insisted.
Govt pays rental of Rs. 140m for ministry buildings on monthly basis:Media Minister
The Government pays nearly Rs 140 million on a monthly basis as rental for buildings where ministries are located, a document tabled in Parliament yesterday revealed.
Chief Government Whip and Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunatillake responding to a question raised by JVP Parliamentarian Nalinda Jayathissa during the round on questions for oral answers, said government pays monthly rentals to 33 buildings where ministries are located.
Accordingly, a sum of Rs 24 million is paid for the Agriculture Ministry premises, while Rs 14 million is being paid for the premises where the Childcare and Women's Affairs Ministry is located, Rs 11 million for the premises of Special Empowerment Ministry to Rs 11.3 million is being paid for the Road Development Ministry premises.
It was also revealed that some ministries including the Foreign Affairs Ministry, Public Administration, National Policies and Economic Affairs and Foreign Employment Ministry have rented more than two office buildings.
JVP MP Jayathissa said the Agriculture Ministry is paying Rs 24 million to the premises where it is located, but it has been closed for 11 months. He said the government was wasting the money of the people and asked as to what measures would the government take on this matter.
Agriculture State Minister Wasantha Aluwihare said the same question had been included in the Order Paper and is scheduled to be answered in May and he would answer it then.
Refusal of Wimals bail application: Hidden agenda to support JO campaign by agitating people: Dilan Perera
The refusal of the bail application of NFF leader MP Wimal Weerawansa cannot be justified, State Minister Dilan Perera yesterday said.
Joining in the debate in Parliament yesterday, he said the Colombo High Court had no reason to refuse bail. He said the non-bailing of the MP could be linked to a hidden agenda to support the JO campaign by agitating people.
Now the MP is said to have commenced a hunger strike. Court decisions cannot be changed by hunger strikes. The correct method was to appeal to the next Highest Court, he added.
Govt has no reason to politically harass Weerawansa: Justice Minister
Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday observed that it was humorous that members of a former government that imprisoned late Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi for six weeks alleging that he misused a vehicle which was out of order and garaged, worrying over Wimal Weerawansa being in remand custody.
He made this observation yesterday, in response to a question raised by UNP parliamentarian Arshu Marasinghe in Parliament, who questioned as to how the Justice Minister defined the allegation that Weerawansa was being remanded on political vengeance.
Minister Rajapakshe further said that MP Weerawansa was not arrested by the President, Prime Minister or the Law and Order Minister. He had been arrested by the Police. "The Police had been made independent by the setting up of the Police Commission by this government," Minister Rajapakshe said. "We can't influence the Police now like the previous government did."
He said that Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi was a politician who worked hard to set up the UPFA government. "Due to various reasons, he sat with the Opposition," Minister Rajapakshe said.
"He used a 16 years old jeep and it was in the garage when he left the ministerial portfolio. But he was imprisoned for six weeks alleging that he misused it. It was justice for the members who worry about Weerawansa's plight today."
He also said the previous government imprisoned 28 politicians including Sydney Jayaratne, Lal Rajapaksa, S A Subramanium and Srimal Perera for more than five months as political vengeance. He added that these members accepted it as justice then.
"For those that the foul was fair during the previous regime, the fair is foul today" Minister Rajapaksa said.
He also questioned as to why purpose the government should take political vengeance on Weerawansa "Is he at least the Opposition leader' questioned Minister Rajapakshe. "He should prove his innocence before Court without staging fasts. He should engage in protests without drinking orange juice."
TNA members always speak of separatism: Justice Minister
Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday, charged that the TNA members were speaking always of separatism.
He made this observation yesterday in Parliament in response to statement made by TNA parliamentarian S Sritharan who said that there was an attempt of ethnic cleansing against his people.
The Justice Minister said that the LTTE killed Sinhala and Muslim people in mass scale.
"They were hacked to death with manna knives," Minister Rajapakshe said. "School buses with children were blasted, trains were blasted by the LTTE. 100,000 Sinhala and Muslim people were chased away from Jaffna during that period."
He also said TNA killed innocent Tamil People including Opposition leader Amirthalingam, Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgarmar and many others.
He said the TNA is speaking only of them.
"They always wanted separatism. During a war various crimes takes place," Minister Rajapakshe said. "Now we are in a position to forget them and face the future."
S Sritharan said the government was in a position not to allow a foreign inquiry into these incidents. He said it was wrong.
He also said the government could investigate into the incidents of bomb blasts, train blasts and hacking people to death and punish the culprits, but there should be a a foreign investigation into the crimes committed during the last phase of the war.
Asking for assets and liabilities of President, PM: An insult to country and its people at large
Justice Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday in Parliament severely attacked Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) over the latters request of information on assets and liabilities of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe under the Right to Information Act.
Joining in the debate yesterday, the minister said this move was an insult and ridicule to the two leaders who made immense sacrifices to bring in good governance to the country.
The Media Minister on the midnight of February 3, gazetted the enforcement of the RTI Act.
Around 9 am the very next day, the first two RTI applications came from the TISL requesting for the assets and liabilities of the President and Prime Minister, under the presumption that they were thieves. Was this the respect they show toward these leaders Certain NGO activists resort to such acts depending on the size of the dollar sack they receive.
What is the transparency of that NGO Reveal the country how much of dollars they receive, he added. He also criticized the media for overly criticizing the Good Governance Government.
In the past, there was heavy media suppression, but the situation had remarkably improved.
However, the media wish to see the end of good governance and bring in the old system again.
If that day comes, let me warn you that nobody will be there in Parliament to speak on behalf of you when your fellows are assaulted and killed, he said targeting the media.

President to take key decisions to ensure political stability
President Maithripala Sirisena is to take several key decisions in government to ensure political stability and make the government more stable, said State Minister of Finance Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena yesterday.
Abeywardena however refused to confirm whether the Presidents decisions would involve a Cabinet reshuffle. Rumours of a possible Cabinet reshuffle however have been rife over the past few weeks.
When questioned why the President was taking two weeks to make a decision, the State Minister said; When a political leader takes a decision, he needs to think of his own political stability prior to that. The decision also has to have certain public approval. Right now, the people are saying that there needs to be certain changes made.
Appropriate changes would be made at the right time,he added.
In addition to changes within the government, the President, Abeywardena said, would also look into restructuring the SLFP. The process, he said would begin after this years May Day celebrations, The President feels that more youth needs to be involved. The SLFP Youth Front has come up well over the past few years. On April 2 we will have the Youth Convention. There is a need for clean politics now and we believe that the Youth can lead the way in that,he said.
In the meantime, the government needs to find ways to stick together and the SLFP State Minister said
blame did not lie on either political party for the current instability and that there were mistakes on both sides.
One such mistake, he pointed out, was in the economic direction the country was headed in and according to Abeywardena, certain adjustments needed to be made in this area.
In the recent past, our investments have been down, government revenue has slipped. The increases made to government salaries have also increased our expenditure.
"The frequent strikes have also made investors think that the country is politically volatile and not attractive for investments, explained the State minister and added that all these issues would be dealt with by the President in the future.
We need to change the direction in which the country is heading,he added.

Ramesh Pathirana cries foul
The Government is causing innumerable obstructions to disrupt the holding of Joint Oppositions public rally scheduled to be held in Habaraduwa, Galle on Saturday under the patronage of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Galle District Parliamentarian and Joint Opposition Galle District leader Dr.Ramesh Pathirana alleged
We planned to hold the rally under the theme Peraliyake Peramaga (forerunning for change) at Modarawatte, on the Colombo- Matara Highway, near the SLAF, Koggala, for which we obtained the required permits from the police, Pathirana said.
The government is shocked over the apparent success of the rally and is plotting to disrupt it. The police who issued the needed permits to hold the rally at the above land later requested us to shift the venue to the Koggala BOI grounds.
The Police are influenced by a certain minister who hails from the area, Dr.Pathirana alleged. Now it is too late for us to change the venue of the rally as we have already made preliminary arrangements. On the other hand our former request to hold the meeting at the BOI grounds was first turned down by the BOI authorities.
Therefore, we will not change the venue of the meeting and it will be held as planned at Modarawatta in the Galle district, Pathirana reiterated. However, when questioned, Habaraduwa Police OIC IP Udaya Kumara, denied any political influence over the issue.
We do not want to disrupt the rally. We first granted permission to hold it at Modarawatte as the BOI authorities first refused to permit the organisers to hold the meeting at their ground. However, later they agreed to allow the meeting to be held at their grounds.
Therefore, the consideration of the anticipated big crowds expected by the organisers at the rally would not materialise due to the insufficient space availble at the ground.
The venue is located between the Colombo  Matara highway and main coastal railway. As we felt that the location was insecure for such a large rally to be held, we made a polite request from the organisers to rethink over the place of the public meeting.Furthermore, holding a meeting with a large public participation along the highway would result in traffic congestion during the meeting, causing immense obstacles to the public,IP Udaya Kumara said. When contacted, Petroleum and Petroleum Gas Minister Chandima Weerakkody,said that he did not initiate any move to disrupt the rally but tried his best to help the organisers find a spacious place to suit the rally which is to be held under the patronage of former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa.

As graduates and students of the MBBS programme at the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), we urge authorities to provide a fair and expeditious solution to our current predicament, which has and continues to deprive us from completing our internship training to be fully registered medical practitioners, states SAITM MBBS students in a release.
The release adds: We regret that despite the clear directive of the Court of Appeal on January 31, 2017, whereby SAITM MBBS graduates were granted the right of provisional registration, obstacles continue to be placed in our path by various parties with malicious intent, without the greater good in mind.
We were all eligible to pursue our undergraduate training in medicine at prestigious foreign universities.
However, we as Sri Lankan citizens, wished to pursue our higher education in the field of medicine in Sri Lanka and SAITM offered us this opportunity.Students registered for the SAITM MBBS degree programme have fulfilled all the stipulated University Grants Commission (UGC) entry criteria and are solely from the Bio Science stream of the A/L examinations.
Contrary to various misinformation being disseminated to the public, there are no students from the arts or commerce streams in the SAITM MBBS programme. We further have no hesitancy in submitting our A/L results, as duly required by the SLMC, when applying for provisional registration, the release states.

SLFP disciplined under President: Weerakkody
The internal discipline of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has been strengthened and properly established under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody said.
The minister was addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters yesterday along with Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Mustapha and Parliamentarian Angajan Ramanadhan.
Unlike during the previous government, no one was tied to a tree by a minister or no minister assaulted individuals. This indicates that the party discipline has been protected and the party has become a more disciplined political force, he said.
The commencement of a new political academy of the SLFP is the extension of this process of strengthening party discipline.
Minister Weerakkody speaking on the future plans of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation said a large-scale infrastructure development project is being carried out to streamline the airplane fuel supply to the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA).
It has been estimated to increase the income generated by airplane fuel selling. Under this project, a new fuel transporting pipeline will be laid through Muthurajawela up to BIA.
He added that more airplane fuel will be produced by Sapugaskanda refinery. Steps are being taken to minimize misconducts at filling stations by linking all filling stations to a network.
The Cabinet paper in this regard will be forwarded to the Cabinet next week, he added.
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Mustapha addressing the media said Sri Lanka is widely accepted by the international community at the United Nations Human Right Commission unlike during the previous regime.
During Rajapaksas regime, the country acted like a frog in a well. But now the vision is wider. Due to an outcome of the non-aligned foreign policy, the country receives better support from other countries, he said.
Both ministers stressed that there is no room for foreign judges to investigate into alleged human rights violations.
The President has clearly stated that no foreign judges will be allowed. Moreover, there is no room for that under the Constitution, he said.
Parliamentarian Angajan Ramanadhan said people in Jaffna are satisfied with the way the government is moving forward. Displaced people are being settled, he added.

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami yesterday wrote another letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to inform him that another 16 Tamil Nadu fishermen were nabbed by the Lankan Navy in two incidents on March 22.
Along with them, two fishing boats were also seized.
 With this, the number of fishermen in Lankan custody has risen to 26 and the number of boats to 131.
The 16 fishermen are from Pudukottai and Ramanathapuram districts.
Seeking the PMs immediate intervention, the Chief Minister, in his letter, said the repeated incidents of arrest and the seizing of boats for years had been frustrating Tamil Nadu fishermen.
 Deprived of their primary means of livelihood, many families are driven to desperation and despondency. Hence I urge you again to take up this issue with the Lankan authorities at the highest level and ensure the immediate release of the fishermen, their boats and their fishing gear, he had written.
The issue figured in the State Assembly, where Minister for Finance and Fisheries D Jayakumar said that pressure was being mounted on the Centre to get Tamil fishermen languishing in Sri Lankan prisons released.
Explaining the measures initiated in this regard, he said that recently he met the Indian Minister for External Affairs to prevail upon her to take immediate action to get the fishermen and their boats released from Sri Lanka. The minister said that `5 lakh will be paid to repair each boat.
 It may be recalled that 16 Rameswaram and Nagapattinam fishermen were arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy for poaching near Talaimannar and Neduntheevu on Wednesday.
Sources said that more than a 1,000 boats left Rameswaram Island and Nagapattinam for fishing on Wednesday evening.
 When eight fishermen in a boat from Rameswaram were near Talaimannar waters, the Sri Lankan navy arrested the fishermen and seized their boat. Another group of eight fishermen from Nagapattinam were fishing near Neduntheevu when officers from the Sri Lankan Navy arrested them and seized their boat.

Top corporates on board with Colombo Leadership Academy to develop EVP Programme
In an intensely competitive business landscape talent acquisition and management is paramount to an organisation's success. As the saying goes, you're only as good as the people you employ-and Colombo Leadership Academy together with People Business is here to share exactly how employers can use a clearly distinguished and positioned employer brand to retain talent and attract the best into an organization.
Employer branding is a hot new buzzword in business circles. In much the same way a traditional corporate brand works, an employer brand projects the core values of a company's work culture to current and prospective employees. Businesses around the world in particular have begun to hone in on building their employer brand - or as it was formally known, an Employee Value Proposition (EVP). The Economist magazine notes that effective EVP management can bring home tangible benefits; including a 20 percent increase in the pool of potential workers, a four-fold increase in commitment among employees and a 10 percent decrease in payroll costs.
Colombo Leadership Academy is bringing a comprehensive EVP development programme to employers in Sri Lanka, alongside strategic partner People Business. The country's employment landscape is rapidly changing colour, with more businesses seeking to engage better with their employees in order to retain top talent and attract the best in the business. Employers are also faced with a severe problem of brain drain due to the emigration of highly skilled personnel.
In this context, positioning an organisation as an employer committed to providing a rich and rewarding employee experience may prove to be a worthwhile investment. Colombo Leadership Academy's programme is geared towards developing this EVP and leveraging it for overall strategy execution and performance sustainability. CLA is a premier leadership development and transformation entity with a strategic partnership with People Business. We have already signed up two large EVP projects with highly reputed Sri Lankan companies in the retail and manufacturing sectors, shared Riaz Hassen, CEO and Director. A well-defined EVP could well become the most promising competitive strategic advantage an organisation could create to achieve its edge over competition to attract, retain, motivate, develop and productively engage human resources to create desired business outcomes.

Currently exports from Sri Lanka to Franc are around 200 million Euros while the exporters from France are only Euro 100 million. There is certainly room to improve, he said.
Country Director AFD France one of the largest donor agencies in the world said that they have been in Sri Lanka since 2009 and have credited around US$ 300 million for various government and private sector projects and banks.
Our commitment to Asia had been around Euros 1.2 billion.Our commitment to the world was around Euro 9.3 billion and our target is to increase our lending to Euro 20 billion by 2020. (SS)

UK welcomes SL co-sponsoring new UN resolution: Demonstrates commitment to HR
The United Kingdom yesterday said by co-sponsoring a new resolution at the ongoing UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, the Government of Sri Lanka has demonstrated its commitment to human rights, accountability and reconciliation as important elements of a lasting political settlement for all Sri Lankan communities.
The UK also welcomed the co-sponsorship of the new UN Human Rights Council resolution by the Government, which it said reaffirms commitments made in Resolution 30/1 in October 2015, for the next two years.
As the report of the Office of the High Commissioner notes, there have been some improvements made to the human rights situation in Sri Lanka since January 2015.
We recognise that further progress is needed and believe that continued support and encouragement from the international community, including through the UN Human Rights Council, will be an important factor in delivering this, the UK said.
The UK further said: we join the High Commissioner in recognising the steps taken by the Government of Sri Lanka since January 2015 to improve the human rights situation in Sri Lanka, in particular the restoration of important democratic checks and balances, improvements in respect for freedoms of expression and movement, the return of some military-held land, the passing of legislation to establish an Office for Missing Persons, the ratification of the Convention on Enforced Disappearances and the initiation of a process of constitutional reform.
However, the UK also said that the High Commissioners report clearly states, much remains to be done.
We encourage the government to take the steps necessary to deliver fully on the commitments it made when co-sponsoring resolution 30/01 and to develop and communicate a comprehensive and time bound implementation strategy.
In particular, we encourage the Government to deliver meaningful devolution through constitutional reform, establish credible transitional justice mechanisms, return all remaining military-held private land and replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act with human rights compliant legislation.
The UK also welcomed the work of the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms and encouraged the Sri Lankan government to give due consideration to its recommendations.
In a statement the UK went on to say that in November 2015, the UK committed 6.6 million over three years to support Sri Lankas ambitious reform agenda.
This includes work on police reform and training, defence engagement, support to the UNs work on reconciliation and peace building, inter-religious dialogue and mediation, capacity building on anti-bribery and the fight against corruption, and demining in the north of the country.
The UK and the wider international community are helping support Sri Lankan government efforts to implement its commitments on reconciliation, accountability, human rights and a political settlement that delivers equitable and just governance for all Sri Lankans.

Wariyapola Sri Sumangala and Sri Rahula clash in 19th Battle of the Golds
Wariyapola Sri Sumangala Cricket team
The much awaited 19th Cricket encounter between Wariyapola Sri Sumangala (St. Pauls) College and Sri Rahula College, which is called the Battle of the Golds will take place on Friday March 25th and Saturday March 26th. at the Pallekelle International Cricket Stadium. They are also two of the oldest schools in Kandy.
Cricket is one of the major sports at Kandys Wariyapola Sri Sumangala (St. Pauls) College. The school has a long history which is 138 years old. It was originated under the name St. Pauls College as a junior school of Trinity College, Kandy. After laying the first brick on 8th February in 1879, the new school was started as St. Pauls English School.
It was considered a boys school. Later in the 1980s, the name was changed to Wariyapola Sri Sumangala College. They first played cricket in 1894. They gave up the sport and after an 87-year-long layoff; they started playing cricket in 1981.
This was largely due to the efforts of former Sri Lanka cricketer and Kandy Municipal Council Commissioner the late D.H. de Silva. He coached them to play cricket well.
Special mention must be made of D.D.T. Alwis who also coached the school. This time Sri Sumangala (St. Pauls) College are led by Mithun Karunarathne (Captain) and has a good bating line up and are sure to give a good batting display in this most important game.
So, much will be expected from Avishka Pushpakumara, Chamod Premarathne, Sandakan Ekanayake, Miraj Rajapaksha, Isuru Kiulathunga, Shemel Neradya.
Sri Rahula College Katugastota is also one of the oldest cricket playing schools, started the game of cricket in 1890s but gave it up a few years later and were more involved with football, athletics and hockey.
However, in the 1970s they came back with cricket. A big hand should go to Aubrey Kuruppu, who did his best as coach, Aubrey is a former St. Thomas College, Combined Schools, University of Peradeniya, Saracens CC, Central Province and Sri Lanka Presidents XI cricketer and cricket commentator.
He trained many cricketers to come up in the game, unfortunately though, when they come up to under 17 level they are being snatched up by other schools.
Most of the cricketers learned the finer points under him and later joined other schools for better perks, today one player is at national level. Sri Rahula College are led by Dileesha Madushanka a dashing batsman who has made over 500 runs, and also runs are expected from the bats of Chamika Samarasekara, Madushan Paranavithana, Ravindu Kapukotuwa, Krishantha Dilshan
So, it going to be two good days of cricket So, today if the weather stays good, batsmen are expected to dominate game and in this aspect the luck of the coin will go a long way in deciding the outcome of the this biggest and most looked forward cricket match.
The teams
Wariyapola Sri Sumangala (St. Pauls) College - Avishka Pushpakumara, Mithun Karunarathne (Captain), Chamod Premarathne(Vice Captain),S andakan Ekanayake, Miraj Rajapaksha, Isuru Kiulathunga, Shemel Neradya, Choolaka Wijekoon, avida Bandara, Vihanga Weerathunga, Viraj Wickramasinghe, Eranga Wijesiri, HiranWeerasinghe, Prebash Karunathilake, Chamara Bandara, Lahiru Wickramasinghe, Chathura Jayaratne, Niyomal Gunawardana, Umaga Silwa, Hemantha Wimalawikrama (Coach) T.M.S.

The Wife and my Death Squad..!
Twas a small argument wed had the night before, but the wife wasnt looking at me as she read the papers this morning. From the corner of my eye I watched her chuckle then snigger and say, You should be careful when you write! Otherwise, wham! Wham! Wham! And youll be gone!
Whoa! Whoa! I said incredulously, What brought this along
She sniggered again and left the room, leaving the paper she had been reading half open. I scuttled over and looked at what had brought out her outburst, then stared fearfully at the headline, Field Marshall Fonseka had testified that Death Squads had targeted journalists!
I looked furtively out of my window. Was that a branch of a tree or a rifle pointing at me I walked hastily to my laptop and scanned my previous columns. Had I written anything against the rich, the famous or the powerful Id written a few on Trump, and that was scary. I pulled out my phone and shakily called the Whitehouse, Sir, Im sorry! I said, Please dont shoot me!
Do you have a beard
Yes! I said shakily, I do!
Just hold on, till our satellite tracks you!
I slammed down the phone and looked fearfully into the sky. I didnt know how American death squads operated but Id seen a video showing how the SEALS killed Osama, and ran to the gate and locked it. The lock was Chinese and I speculated that by the time the US soldiers figured how to open a Chinese lock, I could jump out of the window and be away.
Life had suddenly turned topsy-turvy. I stared at my previous columns, Id written a severe one on Modi, and I decided Id ring him and apologize, Sir, I said into the phone, Please forgive me!
We will conduct a surgical strike on you! said the now famous voice.
No!No! Leave me alone! I wept as I put down the phone.
The wife came back to my room. Something the matter
I think I went too far! I said weakly.
Yes, she said, You did. Maybe its time for an apology!
Im sorry! I said, I should not have said harsh words to you last night!
Apology accepted! said the wife, looking pleased as punch. Now whats next
Death squads! I whispered. Im scared!
Ill handle it! she said, Now that youve apologized, just go and write!
I went gratefully to my laptop and stared at the blank screen, then heard my wifes voice speaking quietly into her phone from the other room, I tiptoed to the door, It was a bit difficult, she giggled, Trying to imitate Trump, then Modi, but it was worth the effort!
I frowned, then smiled, then guffawed, opened my windows and looked happily at the bright blue sky, it was good to be alive, a journalist, and not have a death squad waiting to mow me down..!

Wimal seeks bail under exceptional circumstance citing daughter's ill health

National Freedom Front leader MP WimalWeerawansa arrested and remanded for allegedly misusing 40 vehicles belonging to the State Engineering Corporation (SEC) today filed a fresh bail application in the Colombo Fort Magistrate's Court citing his 15-year-old daughter's mental health condition be considered as an exceptional circumstance to release him on bail.
Wimal Weerawansa had been remanded till April 3 by Colombo Fort Magistrate for allegedly misusing 40 vehicles belonging to the State Engineering Corporation (SEC) while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister incurring a loss of Rs. 91 million to the government.
Filing a motion before Fort Magistrate Ms. Lanka Jayaratne, President's Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe with counsel Kapila Gamage moved Court that their client be released on bail taking into consideration his daughter's mental health condition as exceptional circumstance.
"She was admitted to the Ragama Hospital and later transferred to the Lady Ridgeway Hospital.
Her mental health condition has been getting worse owing to the impact of separation between father and daughter over a period of two months," defence counsel added.
Defence counsel further tendered in Court several medical certificates pertaining to the health condition of Weerawansa's daughter.
The Magistrate announced that she would make an appropriate order in this regard on April 3. Weerawansa was arrested by the FCID on January 10 under Public Property Act charges.
On January 24, the Magistrate refused to enlarge the former Minister on bail observing that the evidence presented before Court have proved that former Minister Weerawansa had intentionally given these vehicles to his close relatives and his party activists while they were not holding any position at the SEC.
The Magistrate further observed that it is apparent that the former Minister has intentionally and dishonestly misappropriated these vehicles by entrusting them to his close relatives and party activists.
Meanwhile, on March 21, the Colombo High Court had dismissed the revision application filed by MP Wimal Weerawansa observing that the Colombo Fort Magistrates order of rejecting bail was correct in law. The FCID conducting investigations into the alleged misuse of state vehicles had informed Court thatWeerawansa had given his written and verbal approval to the commission to commit these offences while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister.
These vehicles had been given to the SEC on a rental basis to carry out ministerial functions. However, the vehicles in question had been given to five relatives of the former minister including his sister.
Ten other vehicles were given to 10 officials of the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna and the other vehicles were given to his staff members who were not entitled to receive them, the FCID had told Court.
The FCID alleged that Weerawansa had given these vehicles for the use of his close relatives and private staff members without Treasury approval during 2010 to 2015.
However, the defence had denied the allegations and informed Court that the FCID is conducting a politically motivated inquiry to punish the governments political opponents.
The FCID had filed a B report in Court againstWeerawansa alleging that he misused 40 vehicles while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister incurring a loss of Rs. 91 million to the state.

Yes,it is fun...
This year the Drama Society of S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia will be 145 years. 145 years of excellence in Drama. 145 year of talent, determination and hard work. 145 years of Drama at the highest standard. English Drama Societies features the Drama Club of this grand and prestigious school.
We believe that when it comes to our boys, it is their talent that should shine. We guide them but it is really there effort. Everything is really their effort. They work really hard because unlike other schools, these boys are different because they do so much. For them to do drama and other things as well, is a great achievement, explained Teacher in Charge of Drama, Michelle Herft Goonetilleke.
Goonetilleke pointed out, that when the boys take part in dramas, they do not go to win. That mentality has never been present. They go to do their best and have fun.
Warden, Director and I, we always state that if you do take part in a play or competition, it is never to win but do your best and enjoy yourself. That is a policy we have. We usually have an annual production. We also take part in Drama competitions. In addition to that when there are events at College we do skits and little things like that. We also conduct workshops. And in addition to that we have the annual Inter-house drama competition, stated Goonetilleke
Goonetilleke who joined the staff five years ago, feels that since she joined, the standard of Drama has been very consistent. The boys are also fortunate to have an understanding Warden who is very supportive of drama, as he himself has been in the drama society.
We have had great actors before, but if you look at the students we have even today, there are some very talented actors. In Shakespeare Competitions, one notable fact is that we have won the Best Actress Award as well, because our female roles have been so convincing -Steve de la Zilva in 1973 & Chandri Peiris in 1976.
We also focus mainly on the children in school. We want to inculcate the love for drama, but we also want to encourage youngsters to be a part of this experience. We believe in this more than anything, added Goonetilleke
All the boys do the production work as well. No outsiders or old boys help out. They handle the sound and lighting and makeup. Everyone has that experience and it is a complete experience that the kids have.
It is a big commitment, and having said that, when it comes to practices we dont go heavily into the night. We believe two or three hours of solid practice is enough. That is good because the same boys are involved in so many other things. They have to play in a rugger match or do other kind of sports. Most often practices are in the evenings, because we keep their study times in mind. So we practise from 6  9pm. We practise on Saturdays but not Sundays, said Goonetilleke
Goonetilleke mentioned that it is also the rich heritage of Drama at S.T.C that makes the boys want to do their best.
One thing I have noticed is that they are very good at taking criticism. And that is something we dont see very often. They will listen to everyone, take in everything and they will work around it. That is the wonderful quality I have found in our drama society, stressed Goonetilleke
The society have done all three genres  tragedies, comedies, tragi-comedies including musicals. They are a tight knit group watching plays together. When the opportunity arises they go as a group to watch plays.
Oedipus was a tragedy. It was a great experience for the senior boys, because it was acted out on the Chapel Steps and it rained on all three days! Christmas Carol was a musical. Romeo and Juliet was a tragi-comedy. We took part in Shakespeare two years ago with Antony and Cleopatra. Also the younger members participate in all kinds of skits. We have an English Literary Day and the Drama Society performs skits on that day as well. The seniors direct the younger boys as well.
When they did the skit Mind Your Language, for Thomian Pulse, a talent show, organized by the staff club, they actually pulled it off within two weeks. That is the great thing. That is an achievement, because these boys can pull off things in like two weeks!! For this I really respect them. They are able to put together a fantastic show in like two weeks, added Goonetilleke.
Unique experience
Drama has a rich tradition at S. Thomas. It is the oldest society in the school. It is one of the oldest drama societies in Sri Lanka. When it comes to talent, we have a good reputation of producing talented actors. You can name people from the 70s onwards. People who started their acting in S.T.C and gone on to direct plays once they are older. When it comes to standards we are very high and the quality of dramas follows, President of the Drama Club, Sebastian Sansoni. Sebastian placed great emphasis on the fact that the Thomian Drama Squad is very versatile.
I guess what is unique to Thomian Drama is we are adaptable to any challenge or any role. And it is something that we look forward to. We welcome challenges. We can accomplish and do female roles. This versatility comes from the fact that we are very close to each other and we are very committed to what we do. That makes it a comfortable space for us to be what we want to be on stage. It is something I find unique, stated Sebastian.
The play we did  The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, was a really good experience which included a very big cast, lots of props and new ideas within the play itself which included so many people of different ages, doing various roles.
Sebastian feels that acting in school demands a lot of effort and that every student delivers.
I really respect them for that. And I think that they want to do their best. They are very pure in terms of their passion towards the society. Whoever joins, comes to love what they are doing and as a result they put in their best effort, he explained. Vice President Ravishke Tissera commented that the boys have had good results at the Shakespeare interschool competition.
Standards
In general, people look to Thomian Drama as a standard for good drama in Colombo. That reputation S.T.C has had. S.T.C is well known for the interschool Shakespeare. We have won it more than 15 times and we are very well known at the Shakespeare interschool drama competition.
In 2015 we took part in it, and we won the award for the Best Stage Craft. We have also come runners up twice, said Tissera.
I watched a Drama called Cover it Please in 2009 which was hilarious, done by our boys. I watched The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, which was the reason I joined drama. I enjoyed it and it evoked a passion in me. I watched Tragedy of King Oedipus as well and that was also good.
Another Vice President Raynal Wickramaratne commented on the team spirit in the drama club and the unity and brotherhood.
Female characters
The strength of the Thomian Drama Society comes a lot with the acting itself, because a lot of people acclaim us for the way we act, such as how we do our female characters. In terms of our inter-house drama competitions, we have been up to a very high standard. We have our own thespians writing, directing it and organizing Stage Craft. That is one thing that is up to a very high standard, said Wickramaratne Committee Member Nilesh Bartlett pointed out that in terms of production they have maintained a very high standard.
Some of the most memorable productions are Christmas Carol, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe and even last year we did an extract from Mind Your Language, which proved to be very popular. So all of these are fairly memorable.
I think there is a common misconception about drama, that it is perceived to be very easy, and a lot of people can take lightly. But very few people realize what goes on behind the stage, which involves a lot of hard work. The exposure you get in drama at S.T.C, I dont think a lot of schools can offer it. We have students drawing up budgets, and that type of exposure at a corporate level, such values are inculcated into our students at such an early stage. Yes it is fun but there is a lot of hard work that goes behind, said Nilesh.
Anoushka Weerakkody, worked backstage during last years skit  Mind Your Language and felt that the effort put in was tremendous.
One thing that really helps us to act, which is mostly done by the Director is that we keep out phones aside. It is a set rule that we have to keep our phones on the table before we act so that we can concentrate fully, said Anoushka. All the boys generally agreed on the work ethic saying that it is a good mixture of fun and hard work. When practice does start there is the simple discipline of not talking too much and focusing on what needs to be done. Of course a joke is cracked here and there to lighten the mood. The boys also agreed that they take their work seriously, to bring out the best that they can for the show.
And the greatest enjoyment they get is when they pull of a successful production, because it is and always will be a collective effort!

All steps taken to control dengue in Trincomalee
All resources have been made available to combat the dengue epidemic in the Trincomalee district, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday. He also said that the spread of dengue in Sri Lanka could be attributed to various epidemics that are spreading in South Asian countries which has caused a serious health hazard. The Premier also said that various epidemics are spreading in various South Asian countries and it should be considered a regional issue. He added that bird flu is spreading in South Asian countries and millions of poultry had been culled in South Korea.
We have to be vigilant on this issue as it could affect the tourism industry, Premier Wickremesinghe said. The Prime Minister made these observations in Parliament yesterday in response to a question raised by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena under Standing Order 23(2).
City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauf Hakeem who also joined in the discussion said more than 800 security personnel had been deployed in the Trincomalee District to combat dengue that is spreading in the district.
Leader of the House and the HighWays and Higher Education minister Lakshman Kiriella said that when he met the Cuban Ambassador around 20 years ago, he told the Minister that Cuba had controlled dengue commendably when Sri Lanka had failed to do so.
Raising a question, MP Dinesh Gunawardena said that the Dengue epidemic is spreading now. When Dengue is controlled in Colombo it spreads in Kinnia and when the epidemic is controlled there, it is spreading somewhere else. He demanded to know as to what measures the government had taken to combat the dengue epidemic.

UNHRC, EU insistence on foreign judges threatens countrys sovereignty: Wijeyadasa
The UNHRC and EU insistence on foreign judges on the proposed mechanism for truth seeking, knowing that there is no provision for it in the Sri Lankan Constitution, accounts to a threat to independence and sovereignty of the country, Justice Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakse said in Parliament yesterday.
Are all these international bodies asking us to violate our own Constitution he questioned.
On the one hand, they are asking us to set up a mechanism, punish and take legal steps against those found guilty. But on the other hand, they are asking us to ensure reconciliation. These are contradictory and cannot co-exist. When somebody gives evidence over a certain past incident and says that this or that person is responsible for war crime, the tri-force and police personnel who risked their lives to protect the countrys unity and sovereignty will be agitated.
Then there will be a dispute between the Sinhala and Tamil communities again. Reconciliation cannot be achieved in this manner. This will open a path to another war, the minister stated.
The minister was also critical of the interference of the EU regarding the GSP plus trade concession.
If the EU is to give back this facility, then it is high time for that. We have been waiting for two long years. Now it is said that it would be given in May and we are not sure how long they will keep postponing. We have made remarkable progress on good governance. If Western countries who appear to be friendly try to exceed their limits and order us to bring in this and that law to facilitate the GSP relief, we are not ready to do that. If they are trying to infringe on our sovereignty taking advantage of the economic hardships of the country, we cannot agree to that, the minister stressed.
The minister said the EU demanded to make a large number of legal reforms to facilitate the GSP plus benefit, adding that most of them had been done. However, he said those were made not simply because of the demand by the international community, but since they truly meant to uphold human rights and justice of the people.

Apple launches red iPhone 7 and video app
Apple has launched a red version of its iPhone 7 and 7 Plus as well as a new video app for iOS.
The red iPhone celebrates Apple's 10-year partnership with Red, an organisation that aims to combat Aids.A video app for iOS, called Clips, has also been revealed and will be released with iOS 10.3, which is expected to launch soon.
One tech analyst suggested Apple was increasingly trying to associate its products with ethical ideals.
All of the money raised by Red - a venture originally founded by U2 musician Bono and activist Bobby Shriver - goes to Global Fund HIV/Aids grants.
Among other things, these grants provide testing and treatment for patients with the aim of wiping out transmission of HIV.
Some profits from sales of the phones will go towards Red.
Apple was increasingly branding itself as a force for social good, suggested tech analyst James Moar, at Juniper Research.
It is a way of them kind of beefing up that side of their business, he told the BBC.Image copyright Apple Image caption Artistic filters for photos and videos continue to be popular with users
Apple also unveiled a new video app with playful features, such as stickers and filters, not unlike those made popular by Snapchat.
Fun effects including comic book filters, speech bubbles, shapes and full-screen animated posters help bring out the personality in videos made with Clips, Apple said.
It is similar to what Snapchat has tried to do with its spectacles [that have a built-in camera] - it is saying, Be back in the moment, said Mr Moar.
But I don't see it doing much beyond retaining existing users.
Apple also announced a new iPad with a 9.7in (25 cm) screen and an improved processor. Models in the UK will start at 339, for a 32GB wi-fi only version. BBC

Bernard Botejue joins hands with ReForest Sri Lanka for greener tomorrow
An environmental project was witnessed in Ratnapura recently, spearheaded by one of the oldest apparel manufacturing company in Sri Lanka.
Implemented under its key annual CSR initiative, Bernard Botejue Industries joined hands with ReForest Sri Lanka to reforest seven acres of land in Ratnapura.
The timely initiative was of great significance as it was recorded as the largest single-day reforestation project that has taken place in the history of Sri Lanka with the planting of 4,000 trees.
The event was held with the participation of a large number of volunteers including the employees and staff of Bernard Botejue, members of ReForest Sri Lanka as well as the residents of the area.
Forests are rapidly dwindling due to various reasons including climate change, global warming and human interventions. A considerable number of bush fires were reported towards the end of 2016 and the situation continued in early 2017 destroying acres of land in forest reserves.
Bush fires not only destroy primeval trees, wildlife, and eco-systems, but also have a drastic impact on the climate and dry up water sources and springs, which in turn causes water scarcity throughout the island.
Janaka Botejue environmental enthusiast and Chairman of Bernard Botejue Industries, expressing his views over this momentous project said, We began this reforestation initiative last year by distributing 850 samplings to all the workers of Bernard Botejue Kolonna and the residents of the area to be planted as a part of the factory's anniversary celebration."
Unlike projects that give instant results, this initiative will be different as it contributes to the bigger picture of the deteriorating environment we live in.
The thousands of trees we planted today will not only purify the air and enrich the soil, but also help the country immensely to restore its receding forest coverage and refill water springs in the long run.I would like to take this opportunity to thank ReForest Sri Lanka for the invaluable support they have extended to us throughout this initiative."
Bernard Botejue Industries (Pvt.) Ltd. was established by Bernard Botejue back in 1948. Growing from its humble beginnings, Bernard Botejue today has diversified its business making strong foot prints in scores of industries and sectors including apparel manufacturing, luxury travel, and state of the art music studios.
The tree planting Project of Bernard Botejue Kolonna in collaboration with ReForest Sri Lanka took place under the guidance and purview of S.M. Samarasinghe, the Divisional Secretary of Kolonna.
Initiator and Partner of ReForest Sri Lanka Achela Meddegama said, It's a great privilege to partner with Bernard Botejue Kolonna, a company that has been well known for generations in the apparel industry"

Brexit vote: Single market benefit largely imaginary
The trade benefits of belonging to the European Union have been largely imaginary, according to the social policy think-tank Civitas.
Its analysis argues that exports from non-EU countries to the single market have grown faster than the UK's, since its creation in 1993.
That lends weight to the argument that no EU deal is better than a bad deal, the author said.
Theresa May will start talks on the UK's departure from the EU on 29 March.
The prime minister will officially notify the EU of the UK's intention to leave by triggering Article 50 and writing to European Council president Donald Tusk.
Economies that trade with the 11 founding members of the single market, using World Trade Organization (WTO) terms, have increased their exports to the EU five times faster than the UK has, over the past 20 years, the study says.
Michael Burrage, the report's author, said that before joining the single market in 1993, the UK's exports to the EU grew at a faster rate than major economies such as the US, Canada, Australia, Switzerland, Norway, South Africa and Brazil.
But since joining, export growth from those countries to the EU has now overtaken that of the UK's - a development he said was counterintuitive.

British Ministers attempt to save stabbed police officer fails
A UK foreign minister and ex-soldier Tobias Ellwood rushed to the aid of a police officer who was stabbed in the wild terrorist attack at the British Houses of Parliament, giving the cop mouth-to-mouth resuscitation before he died.
A blood-stained Tobias Ellwood, Britains Minister for the Middle East, can be seen in photos performing CPR on the officer on Parliament grounds surrounded by first responders after a knife-wielding madman stabbed the cop following a chaotic series of events that left two other people dead and several wounded. Ellwood said the officer, whose identity was not immediately released, died at the scene, according to the BBC. The Tory MP attempted to give the officer mouth-to-mouth and stemmed the blood flow by applying pressure to the wounds as he waited for an ambulance to arrive, The Telegraph reported.
A source close to Ellwood told The Telegraph, [He] tried to give mouth-to-mouth and stem blood flow from multiple stab wounds to the officer until the chopper and medics arrived. Photos of Ellwood at the scene show him wearing a blue suit with blood on his hands and forehead. Ellwood, a former soldier, lost his 37-year-old brother in a terrorist attack in Bali in 2002, according to reports.
Ellwood was lauded on social media as a hero.
Meanwhile, the Islamic State (IS) group has claimed responsibility for an attack in London that killed three people, the Amaq propaganda agency linked to the jihadist organisation said on Thursday. The claim marks the first time the group has taken responsibility for an attack in Britain.
The perpetrator of yesterday's attack in front of the British Parliament was a soldier of the Islamic State and the operation was carried out in response to calls to target coalition countries, Amaq said citing a security source. Britain is a member of the US-led coalition fighting IS in Iraq and Syria that the jihadist group has urged its followers to target with attacks.

Chinese troops join Pakistan Day parade in display of growing friendship

ARMED Chinese troops joined a military parade on Pakistan Day on Thursday in a sign of deepening ties between Beijing and Islamabad.
Soldiers from the ChinesePeoples Liberation Army, the worlds largest, had an audience with Pakistans Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and military chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa. Pakistans PresidentMamnoon Hussain called the event historic.
The Pakistan Armed Forces flexed its capability with long-range rockets, tanks and other military hardware. Saudi Arabian and Turkish troops also participated in the parade.
The countrys national republic day commemorates the passing of the Lahore Resolution in 1940 which popularised the name Pakistan, and the subsequent adoption of the Islamic Republic of Pakistans constitution in 1956.
Chinese participation in the parade signals closer relations between the two countries, who share mutual antipathy towards neighbouring India. China built its largest embassy in the world in Islamabad in February 2015 and Pakistan considers China an all-weather ally.
Recent years have seen the countries become even closer on the back of the US$57 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a Beijing-funded network of road, rail and pipelines that will link western China with Pakistans Arabian Sea port of Gwadar.

China has long urged Islamabad to crack down on Islamist militants, concerned about links with Islamic separatists in the volatile far-western province of Xinjiang.
Towards that end, Pakistans powerful military looks set to reinstate secret military courts to try civilian terror suspects,Fox Newsreportedon Thursday.
The military has basically ruled the country almost since its inception, said Michael Kugelman, the deputy director and senior of associate for South Asia at the Wilson Center.
The military courts are a confirmation of how the military is in the drivers seat when it comes to going after terrorists.
The worlds tallest building, The Burj Khalifa in Dubai, was lit up with the Pakistani flag on Thursday night to mark the occasion.
Ironically, mistreatment of South Asianmigrant workersduring the construction of the megatower has marred its reputation.
Pakistani officials met with seven Taliban leaders in Islamabad on Friday, ahead ofpeace talksorganised by China, Pakistan and Russia to be hosted in Moscow in April.

No lottery grand prize winners in Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka which has a population of a little over 22 million people have over 4 lotteries per week with an average of three draws each day by the NLB and Development Lottery.
In contrast, Thailand which has a population of a little over 60 million people have only two lotteries per month and there is always a winner of the grand prize. In Sri Lanka there are no grand prize winners as the winning ticket has not even been printed.
Its time the authorities look into this and see that the total number of tickets per draw that are printed.
There is only a limited number of tickets with a particular alphabetical letter which is in the region of 20,000. When different numbers are given the numbers range from 10 to over 70, so getting a combination of 4 numbers within the 60 numbers is very remote.

Colombo Dockyard records negative financial performance
The adverse offshore vessel market conditions, contract cancellations and the further impact of contract re-negotiations has resulted in a negative financial performance for Colombo Dockyard during the year ended December 31, 2016, Chairman Dr Toru Takehara told shareholders in the companys latest annual report.
Takehara however noted that despite these challenging circumstances, the Company has managed to achieve substantial progress towards reversing losses suffered in the previous year, once again proving its resilience in the face of a challenging market environment.
Given the challenging conditions prevalent in the offshore petroleum industry, the Company has worked to further diversify its client portfolio in order to ensure that our strategy of continuous growth with stable earnings is maintained moving forward.
While we will continue to maintain our strong relationships with existing clientele, Colombo Dockyard is also focusing on the construction of specialized vessels for other market sectors.
Parallel to the rising global interest in renewable energy, we see significant opportunities for growth in the construction of support vessels for cable laying and offshore wind turbines. Additionally, the Company is also working to attract new inquiries for high-spec vessels, river vessels, and passenger boats for the tourism and leisure sector. 
As more of vessels seek to achieve compliance with the global new standard, we anticipate a significant uptick in activity in terms of orders for ship repair and ship modification coming to Colombo Dockyard.
Takehara further noted that Colombo Dockyard is seeking new business of ship building and ship repair, Colombo Dockyard anticipates a steady recovery in its financial performance and a return to profitability over the coming financial year and beyond.

Compromise will lie somewhere in between
March 25 marks the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, an agreement that established the European Economic Community. The document is still one of the two most significant treaties in the contemporary European Union (EU).
The EU is also one of the major influencers in Sri Lanka and as Sri Lanka faces the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Tung-Lai Margue, Ambassador of the Delegation of the European Union to Sri Lanka and the Maldives in an interview with the Daily News said the events in Geneva were certainly of interest to the EU in the context of the GSP+ process and the European Parliament, which is set to review the process next, would be keeping a close watch on the outcomes from Geneva.
Excerpts follow:
Q: Can you talk about the economic growth that the EU model has brought with it
A: I think that few people realise how much EU membership has brought to member states. In terms of shared prosperity, the average GDP per capita in the EU has almost doubled over the past 20 years. The increase has even been over 10-fold for some of the poorest countries. Of course, you have a mix of very developed countries, such as Germany, Spain, and the UK, and other countries that have joined more recently, such as Bulgaria and Romania who are not as developed.
Nevertheless, for these countries, and in particular the ones from the eastern part of Europe, membership has resulted in very clear increased prosperity and increased income for the populations. Another thing that people dont always think about is unemployment.
Of course there is unemployment, but what needs to be known is that 10 million jobs were created between January 2013 and September 2016. Of course, you have different situations in different countries, and Spain still has a large share of unemployed people, but its being resolved progressively, and the same applies to Italy. But they are catching up and creating new jobs. But the big challenge remains youth unemployment. Its clear that well still have to work on this more.
The 300 million euro Juncker plan for the three coming years will help create new jobs.
Q: Can you talk about how the EU system and values have influenced the Asian region
A: Well, what I would like to say is that the EU has been an evolving project. It started as an economic project, its founding states also sought to avoid the repetition of two world wars. Behind that economic background, you also had the idea of creating a form of solidarity between the people of Europe. So it progressively became a more political undertaking, and with the treaty of Lisbon it became the European Union. The accent on the Union is very clear.
It was a political ambition to put together a number of areas of cooperation that were until then purely under national sovereignty. It has shifted towards cooperation in areas that were for a very long time issues of sovereignty. For instance, home affairs and justice are now very clearly strong areas of cooperation, as are defense and security.
At the same time, because of our importance as a trade partner and as a trade block, we have developed the external projection of our values that are incorporated even in our trade matters. The GSP+ is a very clear example, where we use the leverage of trade to promote EU values in terms of human rights, good governance, and rule of law.
We have very long-lasting cooperation with Asian countries in general, and we are trying to promote these ties through a number of regional organizations. We have very close contacts with ASEAN, and we would like to have similar regional cooperation with SAARC, but unfortunately that organization is less developed and less strong, if I may say so, than ASEAN. But we try to promote regional organizations. And the EU discusses policy matters of concern, such as violations of human rights, improvements to civil society, and the fight against corruption, with each of these organizations.
Q: What is your view on what Sri Lanka should be doing with respect to the UN Human Rights Councils draft resolution
A: Although the process is not finalized yet. We have already made a declaration that we are fully supporting the process and most likely the renewal of the resolution for the two coming years. So theres no doubt about our support.
And the Sri Lankan government is behind the process, and we are seeing a commitment from the government to pursue its efforts in terms of reforms. And we are supporting this, not only through words, but also through concrete projects.
Q: Should the Sri Lankas progress on human rights be part of its application for GSP+ status
A: What is happening in Geneva is certainly of interest in the context of the GSP+ process. The European Parliament is looking at the position of the European Commission, which on January 11 shared that it would be ready to give Sri Lanka the green light for GSP+ status. But its now in the hands of the Counsellor of Ministers of the member states and of the European Parliament.
The Parliament in particular will not just strictly look at the conventions. They will have a broader view of things, and obviously they are very interested in what is happening in Geneva.
Q: What is the likelihood that GSP+ status is awarded
A: Its a bit difficult for me to take a strong position on that. What I can say is that my service, the External Action Service, and the European Commission, have assessed that Sri Lanka is ready to get it back because of the substantial progress it has made. Now, you need to know that the European Parliament is an independent body. What they would say remains to be seen.
When members of the Parliament came here last October to visit the Sri Lankan authorities, they noted that a lot of progress had indeed been made on human rights issues and reconciliation in particular. But they also noted that there were a number of issues that remain open.
The discussions in the Parliament will focus on these open issues, and those talks will occur by the end of the month. These talks will be very important for the overall outcome, which we expect to be announced in mid-May.
Q: Can you comment on the Sri Lankan reconciliation process
A: Thats a very vast question. Reconciliation was at the heart of the campaign that brought President Sirisena to power in 2015. The coalition government also confirmed reconciliation as an aim later on, and indeed you referred to the resolution of the UNHRC. Reconciliation is very much at the heart of that resolution. We have been working very closely with the authorities and following what has been done since 2015. A number of important international instruments and conventions have been adopted. In particular, we are pleased with conventions concerning the disappearance of persons, which is very closely linked with reconciliation.
We have also noted that there have been two nationwide consultations: on constitutional reform and transitional justice. The constitutional reform is very important because it will look at three key elements that are very much connected. Two of them are very closely connected to the reconciliation process: the executive presidency and electoral reform. Last but not least is the devolution of competences. That is one of the key elements, to give confidence and voices to this countrys minority people living in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. The fact that land has been returned is encouraging, but the amount is not yet sufficient.. The creation of the Office of Missing Persons is encouraging, though we are still waiting on its implementation. The rehabilitation of former LTTE combatants is a strong signal as well. We know that the government is about to adopt a Human Rights Action Plan, and we are waiting to see what will come out, and it will also contain important elements that can be connected to the reconciliation process.
Q: Do you see any problems with the process
A: What is of concern to us is that the process is slowing down. The government started well with a number of important reform elements. What we still want to see is further progress on transitional justice. We know its difficult, but we also expect the government to stick to its commitments. The constitutional process has also been slowed. I did get confirmation from the Prime Minister that this process would be taken to its end and would include a referendum. It remains to be seen when this will take place, but the commitment has been reconfirmed.
One package of things where we expect progress to soon be made is the replacement of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Linked to that, we expect improvement to be made on the code of criminal procedure. Now, where progress has not taken place yet is on security reform. Clearly we know that its a complex matter, but the government should also give signals in that area. We still feel that theres a strong influence of the military in the economic activities in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. To conclude, theres been a lot of progress, but a lot remains to be done. We remain convinced that there is tremendous opportunity for this coalition government to deliver for its citizens in order to ensure prosperity and a true reconciliation process.
Q: To move away from Sri Lanka, do you think the rising tide of populism is a direct threat to the European Union
A: I would like to note that this trend is not only to be seen in Europe. In the United States. populism is very clearly what brought the new President to power. We see these types of trends in Turkey and in other countries. I believe that there are always a number of explanations for any trend, but I think that the effects of globalization are part of this. Is it a threat that can endanger the EU I dont think so. I have noted, both in my contact with headquarters in Brussels and with other colleagues, that there is an anti-Trump movement that is helpful for Europe. I think people have started to realize that just providing power to those who dont have the experience, or who come up with poor economic programs, is a bad idea.
These people have started to realize that they are putting themselves in danger if they vote for these people. Theres always a vote of protest, but not many people think this vote of protest will bring people to power who are perhaps not ready to be in power. Something must be done to help those who are disappointed and those who are left aside. We cant continue ignoring them and this phenomenon. And thats the reason why I was very much encouraged by reading the white paper of the President of the European Commission, Mr. Juncker, that discusses how to think about the future of Europe. Topics that will be considered going forward are how to counter populism, nationalism, and xenophobia.
Q: What will the future of the EU look like post-Brexit
A: I believe that the Brexit was a shock for all of us, including, I think, the population of the UK. I think that this shock forces the heads of states and governments to get their acts together. Its very complex and difficult to know what we should propose to the governments and the people of Europe to regain their confidence in the EU construction. And there are a number of options on the table, like going for more integration or more individual state-focused activities.
The solution or compromise will probably lie somewhere in between. There are a lot of countries that are thinking of promoting enhanced cooperation and are ready to progress on certain areas, such as defense, without waiting for the rest of the EU to join. The Treaty of Lisbon allows enhanced cooperation between countries in certain areas without having the whole club coming along. It allows for bridges between individual member states. I think thats one way to re-launch the machine. The debate will start, but it will be impacted by a number of elections that are about to take place. So well have to see the impact of these elections. But Im very much convinced that there will be a strong political commitment between the 27 member states.
