All contestants at NCE Export Awards are Winners
The NCE launched the Application Form for the Annual Export Awards for 2018, at the Hotel Galadari and it was also announced that the awards event itself will be held this year at the Shangri -La Hotel on September 28, 2018.
Sunil Wijesinha the well-known professional who is the Chairman of the Panel of Judges for the selection of award winners for the event this year highlighted to the gathering the value of the NCE Annual Export Awards, and the contribution made by the event to the export development and economic development efforts of the Country.
All contestants at the Annual NCE Export Awards Event are Winners, in the sense that an event of this nature enables Sri Lankan Export enterprises to benchmark and enhance their performance in the internarial market place to face the modern competition related to International Trade. In order to emphasize this point he highlighted the example of Japanese enterprises which were completely devastated following the Second World War.
He stated that at that time the quality of Japanese products had been so poor that most countries were reluctant to import Japanese Goods. In this scenario the competitions that were organized by the Japanese Government to encourage improvements in quality, had paved the way for Japanese enterprises to rapidly improve the quality of their products as well as productivity to reduce costs of production.
As a result the quality of Japanese Products and Services reached high standards wherein domestic enterprises in developed countries began pressuring their Governments to restrict the import of Japanese goods, since they could not face the competition related to quality and price.
Wijesinha highlighted this classic example to emphasise the fact that competitions in the nature of the NCE Export Awards and similar events in other areas related to the export sector serves to raise standards by improving quality, productivity, and other aspects, to face the competition in the modern world of International Trade.
He complemented the NCE for conducting this prestigious event without a break since its inception, for over 25 years assuming national significance, and stated that this event served to fill a void which prevailed at that time due to the inability of the state sector to conduct the Presidential Export Awards regularly due to various reasons.
Finally in his address Wijesinghe outlined the process for the conduct of the event which consists of a two stage process.
Ramal Jasinghe, President of the NCE in his brief welcome address outlined the role of the NCE in complementing the Export Development and Economic Development efforts of the Government with a range of Services that are provided to the Export Sector. In this context the Annual Export Awards event conducted by the Chamber has been a major contribution to motivate and reward Sri Lankan Exporters to enhance their export performance in the International Market place.
Shiham Marikar, Secretary General/ CEO of the Chamber outlined the development of the Export Awards Scheme of the Chamber from modest beginnings. He particularly emphasized the structural changes the event has undergone in recent years, as well as the improvements to the evaluation process of applicants to achieve the high professional standard enjoyed by the event today. He also outlined the elaborate planning that goes to organize a prestigious event of this nature, which has enabled it to be of National Significance.
Oshadhi Karunarathne Brand Manager of Imperial Tea Exports (Pvt) Ltd which export Company has won several awards at this event over the years including the Most Outstanding Exporter Award, and the Silver Award for the Best Performer in Emerging Markets, last year.

Masterminds behind adulteration of SL  pepper will be nabbed
Although pepper grown in Sri Lanka has earned world renown for is high quality, its world reputation is at stake due to a racket masterminded by a few exporters who undermined its quality by adulterating Sri Lankan pepper exports by mixing it with the low-quality product from Bangladesh at mid sea, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The Minister disclosed this when a delegation from the All Ceylon Farmers Congress (Samastha Lanka Govi Sammelanaya) met him at his Ministry on June 12, to discuss measures to ensure a fair price for pepper farmers.
The Minister said since this was a deliberate attempt to destroy the international fame earned by Sri Lankan pepper, the government would call in the CID to investigate the matter and bring the culprits involved to book.
A Ministry release said many farmer problems figured at this meeting. These included problems concerning irrigation, fertiliser distribution, ensuring a fair price for pepper by prohibiting imports during the harvesting season, introduction of new technology to farmers, and soil conservation and formulation of a systematic programme to resolve them.
The Minister assured the delegation that issues raised would be given due consideration to bring about early solutions.

## Title: Merit should be basis for SOE appointments

Merit should be basis for SOE appointments
The need of the hour is to stem the bleeding in SOEs and bring in private sector governance and management practices to SOE whilst continuing state ownership. Even profit making SOEs could improve their performance substantially if the governance issues in SOEs are addressed
The appointments of chairpersons and board of directors of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) should be based on specified criteria; calling for applications from the public or nominations from the professional organizations related to the subject and the political appointments are done away with and those appointed should not be changed with a change of minister, according to a set of proposals revised by the Organization of Professional Associations (OPA).
The revised report says, The practice of Ministers handing over letters of appointment to public officers should cease, since it reinforces the idea that jobs are the prerogative of the Minister.
Most importantly, the selection of board of directors should be carefully screened through a nomination committee of the constitutional council or public service commission to ensure people with criminal charges or accused for bribery and corruptions are not appointed for such positions.
The unsustainable and highly politicized practice of treating SOEs as a means to solve unemployment problems through sponsored employment should cease.
Administrators should be protected against interference by politicians. The Right to Information Act should be strengthened in this respect to make information as to all appointments and criteria followed publicly available.
The proposals further suggest professional management, transparency & accountability, financial discipline, performance monitoring and progress review of key performance indicators (KPIs) measured with provision for incentives, effective internal controls, risk management practices, audit, and adequate disclosures in financial reporting, to be introduced among others at SOEs.
The cumulative loss of 55 strategically important SOEs amounted to Rs. 636 billion for the period 2006 to 2015, which amounts to Rs.31, 750 per citizen. Bank borrowings by these SOEs stood at Rs.471.2bn as at end 2014, thus crowding out the private sector and citizens having to pay high interest rates when they borrow. Between 2009 and 2014 the number of SOEs grew from 107 to 245 while the number employed grew from 140,500 to a staggering 261,683.
As per the Ministry of Finance, 16 SOEs have made a total loss of Rs.87 billion for year 2017.
The return on assets amounts to 0.64% clearly indicating that SOEs are not performing as a whole.
Whatever the regime is in power, SOEs continue to incur enormous and persistent losses and the citizens unknowingly pay for these losses unless they realizes their folly on trusting politicians and their empty promises. Even the poorest person has to pay Rs.181.60 on 15% VAT per year for the infant milk packet they buy for their child to recover losses incurred by SOEs. (The average annual spending on infant milk powder was Rs.1, 210.68 according to 2016 household income and expenditure survey).
If these objectives are to be achieved, the media should play a pivotal role in educating the citizens and citizens cannot continue to be passive observers but to bring in the pressure upon the politicians to introduce the required governance practices to address the sorry state of affairs at SOEs.
The solution to addressing State Owned Enterprises (SOE) governance issues in the long term lies in establishing a proper nomination process for the appointment and carefully screening who get appointed as chairpersons and board of directors of SOEs, similar to the private sector governance principals, according to the Report of the committee appointed by the National Human Resources Development Council (NHRDC). The report says, what is required primarily is public awareness about the political theft that is going on and to bring in high standard of governance to SOEs. The committee report on Explore New Ways of Working in the Public Sector explains the changes required in the governance structure, if Sri Lanka is to get out of this situation. Most politicians will not want to pay heed to implementation of these proposals, as they will lose their ability to amass large amounts of funds they need to win elections and look after their henchman after winning an election, NHRDC report said.

Mom  never  wanted  me to be  an actor
In her first ever magazine interview, Janhvi Kapoor has opened up about why her mom Sridevi never wanted her to enter the film industry.
Janhvi, who turned cover girl for Vogue Indias June issue, was interviewed by filmmaker and mentor Karan Johar as he is the one launching her in Bollywood with Dhadak.
The 21-year-old told KJo that Sridevi thought she wasnt thick-skinned enough to survive in movies.
She never wanted me to be an actress. She was more relaxed about Khushi getting into films. She thought I was nave, that I wasnt thick-skinned enough. She wanted us to live a more relaxed life. She loved what she did but you know it was intense, said Janhvi.
When the Ae Dil Hai Mushkil director asked if she feels a void that she does not have her mother to turn to, Janhvi said, Of course. I could always be the baby with her. When Id wake up, the first thing Id do was ask for her. Id need her to put me to sleep sometimes and she literally had to feed me.
Janhvi further talked about how the untimely death of Sridevi has brought the four children of producer Boney Kapoor - Arjun, Anshula, Janhvi and Khushi - together.
Its made us feel safe and secure. I think, even for Papa, its a source of comfort. Its definitely tied us together. Weve lost mom and I dont think thats a loss any of us will ever get over, she said.

Over-promoting single destination should end
Jetwing Hotels and Travels Chairman Hiran Cooray emphasized the need to implement a high-value, sustainable, low-impact form of tourism model to promote tourist attractions across the country, rather than over-promoting a single destination.
He made these comments speaking at the 39th graduation ceremony of Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hospitality Management, held at BMICH.
Cooray noted that people tend to travel more than before, putting a strain on historic sites. Adopting sustainable practices and models in the industry will keep the numbers low, while making sure the people and the environment can still benefit largely.
We have to say no to over-visitation. Look at the current situation of tourist attractions like Yala and Sigiriya. That is over- visitation. That is the lack of management and responsibility on our part. Cooray said.
The real threat is when large numbers of tourists flock a destination without any proper planning or without sensitivity to the local environment, Cooray said. He said further that sustainable model is one of the best models, that can be implemented and sites can be protected if tourism is well managed.

Promotion to Principals  Service for political revenge
Convener of principals and teachers trade union collective, Joseph Stalin told the Daily News that 800 teachers are going to be promoted to the Principals Service illegally, for political revenge.
Several trade unions of principals and teachers organised a protest in front of Isurupaya yesterday urging the Education Ministry to stop political appointments to the Principals Service and to redress 18 long-felt issues relating to their services.
When asked the reason for the protest, Stalin told the Daily News that around 800 teachers who have not fulfilled the necessary qualification to be promoted to the Principals Service, are going to be offered Grade 1, 2 and 3 principal appointments, for political revenge.
Even though there are vacancies in the Principals Service, those vacancies should be filled with suitable and qualified persons in a proper manner, Stalin added.
However, the Education Ministry Secretary promised the collective to look into the matter when a representation of the protesters had a discussion with him yesterday. The Secretary has further promised to issue a gazette notification next week in this regard, Education Ministry sources said.

AG's appeal for re-trial over Raviraj  murder case fixed for inquiry
An appeal filed by the Attorney General seeking a re-trial into the murder of former TNA MP Nadaraja Raviraj, was yesterday fixed for inquiry by the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal two-judge-bench comprising Justice Deepali Wijesundara and Justice Achala Wengappuli fixed the matter for inquiry on August 2.
On December 23, 2016, three Navy intelligence officers and two others, accused in the Raviraj murder case, were acquitted and released from the case after they were found not guilty by jury trial.
In its appeal, the Attorney General observed that it was inappropriate and imprudent to expect the jury to consider the facts and laws in the trial that was heard in December 23, 2016 until after midnight. The Attorney General maintained the trial process was not appropriate and reasonable to make a just and fair verdict.
The Attorney General further observed that there were several deficiencies in the summing up of the trial judge. The Attorney General contended that several important legal concepts which are relevant to the case were not considered by the trial judge.
The High Court allowed to proceed with the Raviraj murder trial in absentia of the three accused Palana Sami Suresh alias Sami, Sivakanthan Vivekanandan alias Charan and Fabian Royston Toussaint who were evading Court since the initiation of investigations.
The indictments were filed against six accused Palana Sami Suresh alias Sami, Prasad Chandana Kumara alias Sampath, Gamini Seneviratne, Pradeep Chaminda alias Vajira, Sivakanthan Vivekanandan alias Charan and Fabian Royston Toussaint on five counts, including committing the murder of Raviraj and his security officer Lokuwella Murage Laksman under the provisions of the PTA and Penal Code.
Three accused, who were not present in Court, had been identified as ex-LTTE cadres affiliated to the Karuna faction. Wijeya Wickrema Manamperige Sanjaya Preethi Viraj was made state witness in the Raviraj murder trial.
Raviraj was shot dead near his residence at Manning Town in Narahenpita between November 9, 2006 and November 10, 2006 when he was driving his vehicle along Martha Road. The CID recovered the trishaw and the weapon alleged to have been used in the killing of the former Parliamentarian.

Bangladesh women cricketers get cash  promise after Asia Cup triumph
Dhaka, Tuesday: Bangladesh showered its women cricketers with cash rewards Tuesday for their upset triumph over India in the Asia Cup Twenty20 tournament.
The women's team defeated six-times champions India by three wickets in Sunday's final in Kuala Lumpur to claim their maiden title.
Bangladesh became the first side ever to beat India in the group phase of the tournament before repeating the feat in the tense final.
The team returned late Monday to a heroes' welcome. The Bangladesh Cricket Board announced a 20 million taka ($236,000) cash reward for the team and promised to review salaries.
"Each player will get one million taka ($14,800) as a cash reward," BCB spokesman Jalal Yunus told AFP on Tuesday. About $75,000 will be shared by the coaching and management staff, he added.
The BCB will review the salary and match fees of contracted women players this week, Yunus said.

Canada looks to ride out Trump trade storm
CANADA: Canada moved to tamp down spiking tensions with the United States on Tuesday, brushing aside a warning by US President Donald Trump that it will pay for Justin Trudeaus G7 summit remarks.
Trudeau struck a steady-as-he-goes pose after Trumps latest dig, telling reporters, Im going to stay focused on defending jobs for Canadians and supporting Canadian interests.
And Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, who is traveling to Washington on Wednesday to try to salvage the North American Free Trade Agreement, also emphasized the need for calm.
From day one, we have said that we expected moments of drama and that we would keep calm and carry on throughout this drama, she said.
But a source close to Trudeau told AFP Canada was prepared for all eventualities.
If the US decides to apply new tariffs, Canada will be ready, the official said.
Bitter differences over trade dominated the summit Trudeau hosted over the weekend, with leaders of the worlds largest economies lining up against Trumps threats to impose stiff tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.
An angry Trump refused to sign a joint statement issued at the end of the summit, and he and his top aides assailed Trudeau, accusing him of dishonesty and betrayal.
Trudeau had said using national security as a justification for tariffs was kind of insulting to Canadian veterans who had stood by their US allies in conflicts dating back to World War I.
Canadians are polite and reasonable but we will also not be pushed around, he said.
And he confirmed that Canada would press ahead with dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs on July 1 as previously announced.
Trudeau, Trump told ABC News, shouldnt have done that. That was a mistake.
The bust-up has sent relations between the US and Canada, historically the closest of allies and trading partners, to a new low.
On Tuesday, Trump barely let up, telling reporters in Singapore, after his summit with North Koreas Kim Jong Un, that while the G7 summit was good Trudeaus critical comments would cost Canada a lot of money.
The only hint of a softening came when Peter Navarro, the White House economic advisor, apologized for saying there was a special place in hell for Trudeau.
I used language that was inappropriate, Navarro was quoted as saying at a Washington event organized by The Wall Street Journal.
Trump, meanwhile, renewed his criticisms of Canadas protection of its dairy sector, saying: Its very unfair to our farmers, and its very unfair to the people of our country.
We need to focus on the facts, and recall that Washington protects its industries too, a senior Canadian official said, pointing to US agricultural subsidies.

## Title: CAUSES AND REMEDIES: DARK CIRCLES UNDER EYES
## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C
## Date: Thursday, June 14, 2018 - 01:00
CAUSES AND REMEDIES: DARK CIRCLES UNDER EYES
Usually, dark circles are more a cosmetic issue than a real health concern. A person with dark circles under his or her eyes may not be old or unwell, but just have unusually thin skin, unusually highly colored blood vessels, puffy skin, sagging skin, or hyper pigmented skin under the eyes, either for genetic reasons, or because of some temporary condition.
In many cases, there are things you can do to reduce or prevent dark circles. In all cases, makeup can do wonders to change the way they look.
Causes of Dark Circles 
Lets discuss the ultimate causes of dark circles. There are many causes, so there are many actions you can take to address them.
Thin skin under the eyes. Skin under the eyes is thinner than skin elsewhere (half a millimeter or less, as opposed to about two millimeters), and so is more transparent; it shows the blood vessels underneath more clearly than other skin does. Skin under the eyes may be even more transparent if it is pale due to anemia or pregnancy. The blood beneath it appears bluish rather than reddish because skin transmits blue light better than other colors. Thus skin around the eyes may appear bluish, brownish, or even greenish, depending on a persons basic skin color.
Extra melanin (dark pigment) in the skin around the eyes. This hyperpigmentation is common among people of South Asian or Mediterranean descent. It is genetic and has nothing to do with age or illness. A dermatologist may treat this pigmentation pattern with a cream including hydroquinone (bleach).
Shadows from sagging skin under the eyes. Skin may sag into a pouchy, hammock-like shape because age and sun have destroyed much of the collagen and elastin, the stretchy proteins that make young skin look smooth and taut. The sagging skin is thinner in places, and so looks darker, and the tear trough area under the hammock looks dark because it is in shadow.
Shadows from puffiness or edema. Fluid retention can cause the skin to dome up around the eyes, leaving a shadow below. Allergies, crying, temporary illness, excessive salt consumption, or stress (which releases cortisol and increases blood volume) can cause puffiness.

Home Remedies for Dark Circles
There are many things you can do to eliminate dark circles under your eyes and keep them from coming back.
To reduce puffiness, a temporary cause of dark circles, change your sleeping habits. Sleep on your back, elevating your head with one or more pillows. Gravity lets fluid buildup drain away.
Sleep well (doctors advise at least eight hours sleep daily) to have a fresh and circle-free face. Lots of sleep means less stress and thus less puffiness.
Control allergies and the puffiness they cause.
Take proper medication for allergies to airborne materials like flour or smoke. If you have dust allergies, make your bedroom as dust-free as possible: use bare floors, put dust covers on mattress and pillows, and remove or cover upholstered furniture, clothes, books, and papers.
Remove all eye make-up, like eyeliner and mascara, before going to sleep. Anything that irritates eyes can leave them watery and puffy.
Use a Neti-Pot to rinse the nasal passages, to relieve sinus infections and hay fever that cause puffiness under the eyes.
Daily exercise circulates blood throughout the body and the face, reducing puffiness. Concentrate on yoga too, which stimulates your breathing, leaving fresh skin.
To eradicate morning puffiness and bluish color, apply something that cools the skin and the capillaries beneath it, reducing swelling and making the blood vessels less visible. Apply cucumber or potato slices, chilled spoons, or bags of ice water to the area around the eye for up to an hour and a half.Include plenty of green vegetables, fruits, and vitamins in your diet. Eat seasonal fruit like bananas, mangoes, and oranges, along with vegetables like spinach, greens, carrots, and brinjals (eggplant).
Include plenty of iron in your diet, from whole grains, legumes, eggs, or iron supplements.
Reduce salt in your diet to reduce puffiness.
Arrange your life to reduce stress. Stress releases cortisol, which causes increased blood volume and puffiness, and has other undesired effects.
Stay hydrated; dehydration causes thin and sagging skin. Use moisturizer. Limit cigarettes and alcohol.
To keep looking young years longer, protect your face and eyes from the sun.
Ultraviolet light from the sun destroys protein in the skin. Use sunscreen and a hat when you go out.
Using Makeup to Hide Dark Circles 

Makeup is very effective at concealing dark circles, whether they are caused by hyperpigmentation or something else. Use cream makeup in shades a little lighter than your skin tone to bring sunken areas up. Use shades a little yellower, even orange or peach in tone, to neutralize the blue tone of thin under-eye skin.

Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un make history
Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un shared warm words and a historic handshake on Tuesday (June 12) as they held an unprecedented Summit to confront a decades-old nuclear stand-off and enmity stretching back to the cold-war.
The two men clasped hands beneath the white-washed walls of an upscale hotel in neutral Singapore, before sitting down for a half-day of meetings with major ramifications for the region and the world.
The extraordinary encounter saw the leader of the worlds most powerful democracy shake hands with the third generation scion of a dynamic dictatorship, standing as equals in front of their nations flags.
The two men signed a joint statement at the Capella resort. The agreement reaffirms an earlier declaration signed between North and South Korea, and commits the north to work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
We all have to learn a lesson from this meeting.
Our leaders should think about this incident. We are always fighting for power.
To develop our political party, to win the next general election, to win the next presidential election, to win the next provincial council election, to become a member of the parliament, to become a state minister, to become a deputy minister, to become a Cabinet minister, to become the prime minister.
We are always divided. Whatever government proposes, the opposition will object. If it is a proposal to increase the benefits of MPs all will agree and support. We dont keep the country before other things. We always keep the country in the second or third place.
We have to learn from Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un how to take decisions for the benefit of their countries and the world.
They are real leaders. They do not keep on fighting. They are ready to forget the past and do something for the benefit of their countries.

Coal scam
A massive fraud in importing coal has been happening in the country from 2009, Megalopolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.
This is many times greater than the Bond issue. There are many who have profited from this fraudulent process. I urge the President to appoint a Presidential Commission and conduct a comprehensive investigation from 2009 onwards, based on the recommendations of the Auditor Generals report.
How can a single company be repeatedly given the contract to import coal, while several other tenders were called periodically but was later cancelled, giving this single company sole authority, the minister queried at a media conference yesterday.
Those who are responsible for allowing this single company to obtain this coal contract consecutively, should be exposed through this investigation. He said the companys official and unofficial representatives and their activities during the elections and in the political field should also be investigated.
He pointed out that several media organisations were set up with this coal money and a fascist media culture was established to attack targeted politicians and this should also be investigated.
Supreme Sat had claimed they were sending a satellite to orbit and another company named Torian who were working with them should also be investigated, Ranawaka said, adding that their connection should be revealed and those behind this fraudulent satellite launch should be exposed.
It should also be investigated whether a certain LTTE terrorist group was given money in 2014 on the pretext of supplying coal to South Africa and those behind that scam should also be revealed.
Further, it should also be investigated whether there was a sinister plan to have the 2015 Presidential Election boycotted in the North with the assistance of the LTTE, the Minister said.
He noted that he has all the documents to support these charges and is prepared to come before a Presidential Commission and give evidence as there are many who are behind this huge scam far greater than the Bond scam.
With regard to the coal scam, I am the one person who had done a comprehensive analysis about the whole coal import process. I have also presented a proposal to the Economic Commission through the Cabinet, he said.

A commendable move
A Transparency International Sri Lanka initiative to recognize and reward public servants who display qualities of integrity and honesty in the performance of their duties should be acknowledged and appreciated. According to a front page story we carried in yesterday's edition, TISL will be launching a new islandwide Integrity Idol contest to identify and felicitate public officials. This is a very unique public award to recognize integrity in public service, TISL Executive Director Asoka Obeysekera said. He said; the key concept here is to name and fame public officers". He went on to note that very frequently one only hears negative news about the public service but was also of the firm view that there are many positive examples of people working in the public service that is often unrecognized. He called on the public to nominate people they knew, at any level of government, from school teachers to custom officers, whom they believed performed their role with honesty and integrity.
True, public servants and the public service have come in for a lot of flak from the general public down the years. The public service has come to be synonymous with inefficiency and lethargy. The malaise could be traced to the time in the early sixties when the public service came to be politicized, emasculating a once proud institution, placing the public servant under the thumb of politicians. Merit was overlooked in appointments and political lackeys placed in responsible positions. Things deteriorated further when the public service was filled with the supporters of politicians of all hues. Needless to say, integrity and discipline which was the hallmark of the public service in the immediate post colonial era took a heavy beating. The country is today made to suffer the consequences of a heavily politicized public service in terms of efficiency, honesty and integrity due to the ill advised move by those at the helm of power.
Corruption was made to thrive and public officers with political backing making hay, throwing the public service into the dumps. Another facet of the public service that has been observed over the years is the use of public servants for political work during election time. The deployment of the workers of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority in the election campaign of Mahinda Rajapaksa is a case in point. The abuse of authority by senior public officials wielding political power was markedly evident during that era.
The corruption cases under the last government that are unraveling, no doubt, tell a tale. The Sil Redi case where public funds to the tune of Rs. 600 million were misused only go to demonstrate the lengths to which dishonest public officials went to please their political masters. Nay, it shows the impunity with which public officials at the helm acted in misusing public funds in such cavalier fashion.
Yet, amidst the negative outlook surrounding the public service and the wrongdoings of high ranking public officials, there are also men and women of integrity who should be made to stand up and be counted. In this connection examples abound in the past. There was the instance where the OIC of the Peliyagoda Police turned down a request by the head of the President's Security Division, no less, to release a notorious criminal who was arrested, some time ago. One also recalls how yet another police officer showed the door to a powerful government politician who came to the police station to bailout a supporter who was arrested after falling foul with the law. These upright men refused to be cowed by political authority but performed their duties as required.
Such men /women in the public service ought to be recognized and their deeds made public. This will go a long way in making others of similar bent in the public service emboldened to perform their duties honestly and with added zest. It is doubly important in the present context when inaction and lethargy have set in the public service due to the perceived political uncertainty.
The World Cup
It will be all systems go today when the greatest show on the planet unveils itself in Russia - the 21st edition of the football World Cup. It will be no exaggeration to say that, beginning today, for a pulsating 30 days, the world will come to a virtual standstill as the teeming millions across the five continents will all be glued to their TV sets, or, the ubiquitous giant screens, lapping up the skills of the Messis, the Neymars and the Ronaldos amidst the deafening uproars of the fans across stadia in the host nation.
Past World Cups have sprung many surprises, with bottom ranked teams surging ahead by beating even tournament favourites. Of course, this time too, five time Cup winners, and, last time finalists, Brazil will be the main attraction, chiefly due to the lyrical quality of their football, played in sync with the famous Samba of the largest Latin American nation. Germany, the Cup winners in 2014, will no doubt be under enormous pressure to retain the title and is bound to give it their all in this quest.

Cumberbatch thinks Doctor Strange is coming back
Weve been on tenterhooks since Avengers: Infinity Wars cataclysmic ending, so well take any comfort where we can get it.
It comes as a relief to hear that Benedict Cumberbatch thinks hell be back for Avengers 4 and Doctor Strange 2. Probably.
As youll no doubt recall, Strange was one of the heroes who was erased by the Infinity Gauntlet at the end of Infinity War  but not before hinting that it was all part of his plan.
When asked about his future in the role, Cumberbatch said, Oh, Strange Just try to stop me. Thats all kind of lined up as far as Im aware, but who knows I mean, you know, the problem is, how does he get out of where hes at. But thats the only thing. Im bits of dust at the moment as far as I understand. So you really have to ask [Marvel Studios president] Kevin Feige. But as far as wanting to do it, yeah, I would love to go back into that role.
To be honest, were pretty certain that the Infinity War deaths wont stick, but were still happy to hear Cumberbatch agrees with that. Even if he cant give an unequivocal yes.
Avengers 4 will be releasing on April 26, 2019. Doctor Strange 2 hasnt been officially confirmed, but we find it hard to believe it isnt coming in Marvels Phase Four. Deadline

Many underworld figures were killed by the previous regime during their arrests, Senaratne said. He said no leader in the world had managed to suppress the underworld completely.
In Brazil the President tried with both the Police and Military, in the Philippines, President Duterte has been doing the same for many years, but the menace still persists, he said. The minister was answering questions with regard to the measures the government was taking to curb the underworld.
We cannot use extreme measures. We have to work under the framework of our legal system and we are enforcing stern action through that, he added.
A special Presidential committee has been appointed to look into illicit liquor, drugs and other underworld crime, Senaratne said. Recently 17,000 police officers conducted a special operation and arrested many related to drug dealing, We have to keep repeating such operations, he said.

Fisheries, Aquatic Resources Development and Rural Economic Affairs Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa said arrears valued at Rs. 700 million owed to dairy farmers, had been paid by yesterday.
The payment for milk purchases after May 31 would be paid within the next two months, he added.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, the minister said that the dairy farmers had numerous issues when he took over this ministry.
We have developed an action plan to address all issues pertaining to the dairy industry and requested for a time period of two months to solve them. It was wrong of dairy farmers to demonstrate in front of the ministry. Milco had a monthly turnover of only Rs.27 million when I took over the ministry; it has now risen to Rs. 58 million due to efficient work and correct decisions, he said.
Fresh milk collected from dairy farmers was wasted in the past. I prevented that wastage and hence, milk purchased from farmers are currently utilised for the dairy products. That is why Milco is currently earning profits, Minister Zoysa added.
He said multinational companies were producing ice cream with chemical compounds and artificial additives, without using fresh milk.
Only Highland uses fresh milk for their dairy products. Their yogurt has a shelf life of 14 days, whereas other yogurts, which have chemical additives in them, have shelf lives up to one month, the minister said.
We have a plan to stop the import of dry fish, canned fish, chicken and eggs which could be produced here and are negotiating with the relevant parties to provide fresh milk packets to schoolchildren as well as eggs to pregnant mothers, he added.
Minister Zoysa further said that Indian fishermen using outdated and banned methods were catching fish worth Rs. 6 billion in Sri Lankan waters, adding that it was destroying the countrys marine resources.
We will take immediate measures in order to avert this situation. The Indian Government is currently directing their fisherman to use better and legal fishing methods, he said.

The total number of dengue cases reported from the Western Province was 6,804, the epidemiologists said.
Meanwhile, medical experts and Consultants advise the public to seek medical treatment without delay for any type of fever without using home remedies. All fever patients need rest and they should not attend work or school.
All fever patients should take Paracetamol only. All other medications, especially Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID) such as Ibuprofen cause Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) which could turn fatal, they said.
People should keep their premises free of mosquito breeding sites (water harbouring places) during this rainy season in order to prevent the spread of dengue. Even water retaining in a pen clip or a bottle top is adequate for dengue mosquitoes to breed, they added.

London Stansted has just become the seventh airport in the UK to which Emirates operates. This brings the number of daily flights to ten, between Dubai and three different London airports, with Stansted joining Gatwick and Heathrow.
The aircraft deployed on the route is Emirates new three-class Boeing 777-300ER, featuring its state-of-the-art, fully-enclosed private suites in First Class, and refreshed Business and Economy Class cabins. With floor to ceiling sliding doors and sleek design features, the new First-Class suites take luxury to the next level.
To celebrate the airlines arrival to the airport, Emirates and Stansted airport held a launch event for local dignitaries and stakeholders, hosted by Hubert Frach, Emirates Divisional Senior Vice President, Commercial Operations West, and Richard Jewsbury, Divisional Vice President, UK, alongside Stansted Airports CEO, Ken OToole.
We decided to add London Stansted to our network because we saw an opportunity to directly connect the local community with some of the worlds most popular leisure and business destinations. Previously, Londons north east, and the wider 7.5 million people that live within Stansteds catchment areas had to travel into the city, or further, to access airports with global reach. Now, this daily flight to Dubai connects passengers seamlessly to Emirates points across the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australasia, said Frach.
Ken OToole, London Stansteds CEO said, Today is a truly significant moment in the history of London Stansted and we are delighted that our millions of passengers, based in London and the East of England, will see huge benefits from the direct connectivity between the airport and Emirates hub in Dubai and its vast array of onward connections.
The new gateway is the seventh UK airport that Emirates operates out of in the UK; with Edinburgh to follow in October.
Other locations include London Heathrow, London Gatwick, Birmingham, Newcastle, Manchester and Glasgow.

Former DIG concealing  real perpetrators - SSC
The chain of incidents that led to the murder of Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge has been revealed by the investigators, said Senior State Counsel (SSC) Janaka Bandara, before Mount Lavinia Chief Magistrate Mohamed Mihal, yesterday.
The SSC also stated that former DIG Prasanna Nanayakkara had not revealed the names of any persons involved in this matter. "He is concealing the real perpetrators," the SSC said.
The SSC informed the Magistrate that it was suspect if former DIG Nanayakkara had been involved in the conspiracy of this murder.
Senior Presidents Counsel (SPC) Anura Maddegoda, appearing on behalf of Nanayakkara, pleaded that his client be granted bail.
While making his submission, the SPC stated that one of the journalists who wrote an article on the murder of Lasantha Wickrematunge and the assault and abduction of journalist Keith Noyahr had included the names of some high-ranking persons who are alleged to have a connection with this crime. Has the CID recorded any statements from those persons whose names appeared in the newspaper article the SPC queried.
According to the further report submitted by the CID, it would record statements from those high-ranking persons.
The SPC also stated that former Inspector General of Police Jayantha Wickramaratne had filed a fundamental rights application before the Supreme Court and obtained an order preventing his arrest.
In response to Senior Presidents Counsel Maddegodas submission, Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara informed the Magistrate that if there was sufficient evidence against former IGP Wickramaratne, he would be arrested for destroying evidence in the Lasantha Wickrematunge murder case.
Senior State Counsel Bandara strongly objected to the suspects being granted bail. He stated that the most important facts in this case have already been discovered.
The SSC also stated that a few of the junior police officers confirmed that former DIG Nanayakkara was involved in destroying evidence.
Lasantha Wickrematunge was murdered on January 08, 2009, in Attidiya, Ratmalana, while on his way to office.
The Senior Presidents Counsel stated that Nanayakkara was the Senior DIG in charge of the Western Province at the time of Wickrematunges murder, while Mount Lavinia was under his jurisdiction.
Mount Lavinia Chief Magistrate Mohamed Mihal yesterday ordered to further remand the suspects until June 19. The Magistrate observed that the decision to grant bail to the two suspects would be determined at the next hearing.

Future prosperity  through peace
Conflict Prevention and Peace Building are key to a future without armed conflicts. Therefore, it is a field of study that is of the utmost importance since only a proper understanding of Conflict Prevention and Peace Building can bring about sustainable peace. Daily News met up with the Executive Director of GPPAC (Global Partnership for Prevention of Armed Conflict) Darynell Rodriguez Torres and discussed the goals of GPPAC and the future that we all can create together. Torres was recently in Sri Lanka for the GPPAC week.
GPPAC is a network of Civil Society Organisations which is active in the field of conflict prevention and peace building. Darynell Torres, in addition to being the Executive Director of the GPPAC, is also the Regional Coordinator for Latin America and the Caribbean. He has been with GPPAC for the past seven years where he has been leading the policy and advocacy programme.
He has a deep knowledge of conflict prevention and peace building issues and has extensive contacts with external stakeholders including Civil Society organisations, government representatives and high level officials at the United Nations system and regional multi-lateral organisations.
GPPAC came out due to the need to highlight the role of Civil Society in the Prevention of Armed Conflict. This was a result of the report by the Secretary General of the UN in 2003, Kofi Annan. Mr. Annan made an appeal to Civil Society Organizations to work together with the UN, because the UN cannot tackle the issue of Armed Conflict alone. We need everybody involved. This prompted a movement to fill that gap that existed in terms of how our civil society organisations can work more closely with the United Nations and governments and play our role in civil society, said Torres.
Prevention of armed conflict
GPPAC was launched through a number of regional consultations where Civil Society Organisations developed the regional action agendas. This ended up with a global meeting in 2005 at the UN Head Quarters where CSOs (Civil Society Organisations) presented their Global Action Agenda for the prevention of armed conflict.
That was the origin of GPPAC. It has been nearly 13 years since that conference. The organisation has really established itself as one of the most important players in the world, bringing in the perspectives of CSOs from all the regions of the world on how we can build a peaceful and safe society, stated Torres.
GPPAC has 15 regions and is a network of networks. It is a global network composed of regional networks which are at the same time composed of national networks.
The 15 regions of GPPAC are Eastern and Central Africa, Southern Africa, West Africa, Latin America and Caribbean, North America, South Asia, the Pacific, Southeast Asia, North East Asia, Central Asia, Middle East and North Africa, Eastern Europe, Caucasus, Western Balkans, Northern and Western Europe.
We have 15 regional secretariats and they are our network members in different countries. For example, Regional Centre for Strategic Studies (RCSS) in Colombo is the Regional Secretariat for South Asia. So we learn to work together, design together and advocate together, said Torres.
Conflict Prevention and Peace Building has to be understood through the context and where it happens.
What we intend to do is to do an analysis of the conflict drivers in the particular regions - at the country level but also an analysis of the regional trends. Conflicts do not respect boundaries. You see a lot of regional dynamics playing in the context of a particular conflict. So we think to ourselves  how can we make a contribution for civil societies in these countries How can we engage other actors How can we convene them to work together And based on our capacities, how can we add value, pointed out Torres.
Global presence
Conflict Prevention is about managing risks and knowing what the risk factors are, the potential for peace and the drivers for peace with a focus on those drivers. Peace Building is essentially rebuilding relationships that are broken which include relations between people and relationships between people and state institutions. So how can we rebuild these relations that have been broken We do that through dialogue. First you build trust. You put yourself in another persons position. You talk and gain a common understanding. So we try to create spaces for dialogue. We work amongst people and institutions to build up trust, explained Torres.
GPPAC started out as a very loose organisation in 2005 and have been able to consolidate a global network with a presence all over the world. Torres is proud that wherever he goes he meets active GPPAC members in all corners of the world.
We have this global presence that enables us to have this great power and a greater say. It enables us to convey whatever the message we have when we talk to other actors. We have come a long way in terms of our convening power. We can invite powerful actors to our table, which has become one of the distinctive features of GPPAC. This could be the UN, SAARC or the African Union, added Torres.
The GPPAC week which is held in Sri Lanka from June 4  8 consists of the GPPAC International Steering Group (ISG) meeting, the conference on Trends in Youth Radicalization in South Asia and the Regional Steering Group (RSG) meeting GPPAC South Asia. There are 33 participants across the 15 regions.
GPPAC is constantly thinking and strategizing how to use the network better and more effectively and make a difference in the issues we deal with. This week has been extremely exciting and energizing and we are all looking forward to such meetings, said Torres.
Torres remarked that GPPAC looks at nonviolent ways of resolving conflicts, pointing out that the availability of arms is a driver that makes it easy for violence.
We would like to see a greater control of small arms. The greater availability of arms, the greater the potential of using them. I come from Latin America, which unfortunately is one of the regions where the use of small arms is more widely spread by common criminals. This is something we should all try to combat. We need to de-activate these violent drivers in everyday life, explained Torres.
The role the youth can play in conflict prevention and peace building is vital. At the GPPAC week attention was paid to looking at some of the drivers and motivations that prompt youth to join extremist organisations.
We also looked at some of the strategies and work done in regions to understand this process better. We also want to counter this process so as to prevent the potential for radicalization. We want to do this by sharing our perspectives and experiences to find solutions. This is why we say that the role of the youth is critical. Conflict Prevention is a long time process. How are we going to manage our future together This must transcend our own life span. We must think in more intergenerational terms. We need to look at intergenerational dialogue. We must inculcate such a line of thinking in the youth, so we can build a future together, pointed out Torres.
GPPAC week
Torres added that it is extremely heartening that Peace Builders have visited Sri Lanka for the GPPAC week.
We are here to make change happen. We are here to see how we can make that happen. Speaking from my own experiences, I am originally from Columbia which has been in pervasive conflict for decades. When you grow up in that context, you think about what you can do. This was my motivation to get engaged in this field of conflict prevention and peace building. Then I started to learn about international politics and world affairs. What I experience in Columbia can be seen in different parts of the world. The lessons of those regions apply to different contexts.
That has been my motivation and drive to work in this field. You can learn from others. What really drives me is the globalness of GPPAC, said Torres.
Torres also pointed out that bringing GPPAC to Sri Lanka gives most of these participants an opportunity to learn about Sri Lanka and understand its context.
To focus on Sri Lanka in a post conflict scenario gives us a chance to learn about Sri Lankas reconciliation experience. So we all looked forward to these discussions. We also need to look at the appeal that terrorist organisations have for people. We need to look at what motivates people to join these organisations, and what they offer that attracts people to them. What are the root causes So we are here to learn all of this during the GPPAC week, said Torres.

Got  a picky  eater
We really do want to make sure our children get off to a great start in the morning and we want to make sure that their little bodies are fueled to do the best at school, so it can be stressful when they will not eat before school.
Dont panic. This is a completely normal. Here are some strategies you can implement to lighten your load.
1) Eat together

One of the simplest things you can do to encourage great eating habits in your childs early years is to sit down together for family meals. Sitting down together isnt just about nutrition; its about connecting and teaching children about becoming members of society and acting in a civilized way.

2) Get rid of any distractions!

When the family starts to eat, definitely turn down the television and put the hand-held technology (mobile phones and games) away (that means you too, mom and dad). Children get very easily distracted. Practice Mindful Eating by eliminating distractions, your child will be able to put more focus towards whats on their plate.

3) Maintain consistent rules

Its very important that parents of fussy eaters maintain clear and consistent food rules in the house at all times. If your child refuses a particular food, dont be fooled.
Theyre hoping youll offer up something sweet as an alternative.
If you do fall for this, your child will quickly learn that refusing vegetables results in something else being offered. So consistency is the key. Whatever you do, dont force them to eat, bribe them, or insist they finish everything on their plate.

4) Presentation is everything

Children are very observant. Before they even start eating, their eyes are observing what has just been put in front of them. If it looks gross, theyre going to think it tastes gross.
So keep it colourful, neat and interesting. It literally takes an extra minute to re-arrange their food into a smiley face, or make the Triforce out of veggie sticks. Just a little variation can sometimes make a world of difference. Also, try preparing foods a different way.

5) Make them your kitchen sidekick

Getting your child to help with meal preparation, no matter how little, will lead to them being more likely to eat the food as they now have an ownership of the meal and feel proud about helping out.
At the store or market, ask your child to help you select fruits, vegetables, and other healthy foods.
When you get back home, encourage your child to help you put the food away, arrange the fruit, or rinse the vegetables.

Govt. holds STI workshop in Colombo
At the request of the National Science and Technology Commission (NASTEC), the Science and Technology Policy Institute (STEPI) recently held a workshop on capacity building in STI (science, technology and innovation) for high-level government officials and researchers, in Colombo.
The Capacity Building in STI Policy Formulation and R&D Commercialisation workshop was held from May 30 to June 5.
The workshop was designed to enhance the capacities of 50 senior-level officials and managers of the related science and technology government agencies, academia and research institutions.
Sri Lanka has set its national vision to become an upper middle-income country by 2025, by transforming the country into the hub of the Indian Ocean, with a knowledge-based, highly comparative, social market economy. To do so, the country tries to harness science, technology and innovation to create the conditions which will generate economic growth.
In order to realise the vision of national development with sound STI capacity, it is necessary for officials to be equipped with knowledge and expertise in establishing and implementing national STI policy, its action plans, and an efficient STI system.
In most cases, policy formulation and implementation in Sri Lanka are based on ad hoc approaches and intuition.
The NASTEC, under the Science, Technology and Research Ministry, requested STEPI to provide a customised training programme for STI stakeholders about STI policy development and R&D commercialisation mechanisms.
A special team from STEPI conducted this training programme with presentations on various policy tools, R&D planning and evaluation techniques and R&D commercialisation approaches with relevant case studies from Korea.
The inauguration ceremony was held on May 30 at the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration (SLIDA) auditorium, with the participation of the members of the STEPI team from South Korea, officials from NASTEC, Science, Technology and Research Ministry, and invited scientists and guests from institutes in Sri Lanka.
NASTEC Chairman Prof. Gunapala Nanayakkara, delivering the welcome speech, described the present situation in the science, technology and research in Sri Lanka. Dr. Eun Joo Kim from the STEPI team and Science Technology and Research Ministry Additional Secretary H.M.B.C. Herath also delivered speeches. The vote of thanks was delivered by Dr. Kalpa Samarakoon from NASTEC.
The outputs expected from this workshop are to acquire essential knowledge on framework, concept, schemes and tools involved in developing STI policies and managing national research and development (R&D) programmes.
It is also to share Korean experiences and practices which were applied in the fields, as well as to explore policy ideas that could be applied in the Sri Lankan context through discussions with Korean experts.

GRADUATION CEREMONY FOR TINY TOTS
Many children who completed five years were graduated in a Montessori the Abascus pre-school in Austin, Texas. Around 17 children in the Abascus pre-school were graduated on this day. In addition to American children, few others were the children of expatriates presently domiciled in the USA.
Five-year old Vandon Pierce Sivalingams grandparents are Sri Lankans. His father Samantha is married to an American citizen Hope Nickerson. Baby Vandons grandfather Sivalingam was educated at Wesly College, Colombo and graduated as an Engineer from the Preradeniya University. His grandmother Hemamali Wijeyekoon is also a Visakhian.
Abacus Pre-school Director, Steffani said most pre-schools in the USA conduct graduation ceremonies in order to mould the childs life from the beginning. Thereafter when they start their schooling career they have to produce their graduation received from the preschool, she said.
The two class teachers of Abacus pre-school Christina and Judy said newly selected graduates are talented and have achieved many things during the years in preschool. When asked about the criteria that a preschooler should do to become a graduate, teacher Christina said pre- school children who are only five years old are eligible to become a Diploma Holder.
She said first the child should walk on to the stage where the panels of teachers are seated. While walking on to the stage in lines they have to sing together. Each child has to come forward and count numbers from one to twenty in Spanish and each child should recite the school song, class song etc. Thereafter teachers ask few questions such as the capital of the USA, how many states are in USA, the name of the state that the childs pre- school is located and few other questions, Christina explained.
If the teachers are satisfied with the performances of children, the names of each child are called by the head of the teachers panel and each child has to accept the Diploma. The teachers then call them `Diploma Holders.

Howard fought to keep  Jurassic World  characters heels
Actor Bryce Dallas Howard has revealed she had to push the makers of the upcoming Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom to let her character Claire wear heels in the film.
When Jurassic World released in 2015, the audience could not understand why Claire spends the entire film running across the jungle in a pair of heels.
The films director, Colin Trevorrow, tweeted a collage of the pictures of sturdy boots Claire will wear for the majority of the films sequel, directed by JA Bayona, but Howard has revealed the heels are set to return.
In an interview, the actor revealed that the original screenplay was written with extra care about not showing Claire in heels and she was specifically written to be wearing sneakers even in office environment. It was written like, Claires wearing sneakers. Like, specifically, Claires wearing sneakers. And I just circled that when I was reading it and I was like, No... no, its an office, Claire would wear heels.
And then it was like another scene where Im like, Hmm, well Claires kind of like... Shes going to wear heels in this scene also, Howard said.
The 37-year-old actor said she found the heels important to her characterisation.
Its a part of the character and kind of a metaphor for her journey. And thats how it was intended in the first, and intended in the second.
Its important, I think, to be truthful to the character in that way. In that she can do both! She can wear flats, and she can wear heels! she said. PTI

HSBC to invest $15-17 bn. as strategy pivots from cost cutting
HSBC will invest $15-17 billion in the next three years in areas including technology and its core Asian markets of Hong Kong and China as it swings from a strategy of cost-cutting to growth, new Chief Executive John Flint said on Monday.
The announcement is Flints first public indication to shareholders of the strategy he intends to pursue at HSBC, which has struggled to meet its profit goals in recent years after a shrinking of its global empire also cut income.
The update marks a definitive pivot in HSBCs post-2008 crisis strategy, from cost-cutting and restructuring to investment and expansion as it seeks to improve returns. The bank is targeting a return on tangible equity of 11 percent by 2020, Flint said, and will sustain its dividends at current levels.
After a period of restructuring, it is now time for HSBC to get back into growth mode, Flint said. The main points of the banks refreshed strategy will likely come as little surprise for HSBC investors, with the focus squarely on further expansion in China and its prosperous southern Pearl River Delta region in particular. The bank will also pursue further expansion in the British mortgage market as one of eight new strategic targets, HSBC said. HSBC shares showed little reaction to the announcement, remaining flat at 0852 GMT compared with as 1 percent rise in the FTSE 350 British banks index.
The bank has found no silver bullet for its underperforming U.S. business, the strategy update released to investors on Monday showed, with HSBC set to focus on trying to grow its market share among internationally-focused mid-sized companies.
Flint in February said the bank was reviewing its U.S. franchise, which has suffered from lack of scale and the consequences of its disastrous $15 billion acquisition of consumer lender Household in 2003.

iPhone X found to have survived underwater for over two weeks
When Apple launched the iPhone X last year, the premium smartphone arrived with an IP67 rating that makes it dust and water-resistant. This essentially means that the handset is capable of withstanding immersion in up to 1 metre of water for 30 minutes. Interestingly, last years flagship apparently has much better water resistance capabilities, so much so, that it can withstand being underwater for more than two weeks. A river diver seems to have discovered the extreme levels that the smartphone can possibly withstand.
A YouTuber named Dallas, who runs a channel by the name of Man + River, in a video claims to have found an iPhone X in a river. In his River treasure dives videos, Dallas returns lost and misplaced items to their rightful owners. Usually, he claims to find wearables like silver rings, expensive sunglasses, masks, and more, but this time around, he discovered an iPhone X.
On his recent dive, Dallas found several objects ranging from Porsche sunglasses to a 10K gold ring. But finally, he came across a submerged iPhone X Silver coloured variant, that too without a waterproof case on. While many would expect the smartphone found at the bottom of a river to be damaged, Dallas tried to get the handset working.
In the video, Dallas is seen to be opening up the iPhone X, using a hair dryer, and placing the waterlogged iPhone X in a container full of silica gel. After three days of drying out, he plugged in the smartphone and let it charge normally. Dallas was able to get the iPhone to power back on and working. He then found the owner Alyssa and sent the handset back to her. Alyssa was excited as she had a lot of images of her newly born child. She noted that the iPhone X was lost in the river two weeks before it was found. She also reaffirmed that the handset did not have a waterproof case.
While it comes across as good news that a smartphone is able to withstand such a long time under water, it is worth noting that water damage is not covered under Apples warranty.

Ahead of South African Test series
Karunaratne captains  A team to Bangladesh  to regain match fitness
Sri Lankas regular Test opener Dimuth Karunaratne was made captain of the Sri Lanka A team to tour Bangladesh to prepare himself to match fitness ahead of the two-Test series against South Africa starting on July 12.
The left-handed opener was one of the few batsmen to show consistency last year scoring over a 1000 Test runs for the calendar year. He has been ruled out of the ongoing Test series in the West Indies after fracturing his index finger in May. His place has been filled by another southpaw Kusal Perera.
Karunaratne although he is the captain it is learnt will play only in the first two 4-day unofficial tests against Bangladesh before the South African series.
All-rounder Dasun Shanaka has been given the responsibility of vice-captain. The month long Bangladesh tour which runs from June 23 to July 23 runs overlaps the South African Test series which is from July 12 to 24.
The second 4-day unofficial test ends on July 6 which gives Karunaratne ample time to prove to the selectors of his match fitness and form.
The Sri Lanka A team also features Sadeera Samarawickrama, Lahiru Thirimanne, Dasun Shanaka, Lakshan Sandakan and Danushka Gunathilaka  all of whom have played Tests for Sri Lanka.
Fast bowler Shehan Madushanka who recovered from an injury has also been named in the squad.

KIM INVITES TRUMP to visit N.KOREA
SOUTH KOREA: Kim Jong-un invited Donald Trump to visit North Korea during their historic summit and the US President accepted, Pyongyang state media reported Wednesday, calling it the start of a radical switchover in the nuclear-armed Cold War foes fraught relations.
The unprecedented encounter in Singapore on Tuesday saw the leader of the worlds most powerful democracy shake hands with the third generation scion of a dynastic leadership, standing as equals in front of their nations flags.
Kim agreed to the complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, a stock phrase favoured by Pyongyang that stopped short of long-standing US demands for North Korea to give up its atomic arsenal in a verifiable and irreversible way.
In its first report on the landmark summit, the official KCNA news agency ran a glowing dispatch on the talks, describing them as an epoch-making meeting that would help foster a radical switchover in the most hostile (North Korea)-US relations.
The report said the two men each asked the other to visit their country.
The two top leaders gladly accepted each others invitation, KCNA said.
Pyongyang has reason to feel confident after the meeting which was a major coup for an isolated and heavily sanctioned regime that has long craved international legitimacy.
In a blockbusting press conference after the summit, Trump said the US would halt military exercises with Seoul -- something long sought by Pyongyang, which claims the drills are a rehearsal for invasion. The US stations around 30,000 troops in security ally South Korea to protect it from its neighbour, which invaded in 1950 in an attempt to reunify the peninsula by force.
We will be stopping the war games which will save us a tremendous amount of money, Trump told reporters, adding that at some point he wanted to withdraw US troops from the South. Both Seoul and US military commanders in the South indicated they had no idea the announcement was coming, and analysts expressed immediate concern. Ending the drills is in excess of all expert consensus, South Korean requests, and even a close reading of North Korean demands, said Adam Mount of the Federation of American Scientists.
The KCNA report said Trump committed to ending the drills during his meeting with Kim.
It added that denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula would be dependent on the two sides refraining from antagonising... each other out of mutual understanding.
The Singapore summit was a potentially legacy-defining meeting for both men -- comparable to president Richard Nixons 1972 visit to China, or Ronald Reagans 1986 summit with Mikhail Gorbachev in Reykjavik.
World powers from China to Japan, the European Union and Russia welcomed its outcome -- while cautioning it was only the first step towards resolving the nuclear stand-off with Pyongyang. Many agreements have been made in the past with North Korea that have later fallen apart, and ahead of the meeting, critics expressed concerns that it risked being more about headlines than substantive progress.
It also legitimised Kim, critics charged, feting a regime which stands accused of widespread human rights abuses.
In the event, the two leaders showered each other with compliments in the sumptuous setting of a luxury Singapore hotel, a marked contrast from their previous rounds of mutual insults, such as mentally deranged and little rocket man.
Trump said he had formed a special bond with Kim, whom he described as very talented.
KCNA said the two leaders ate and walked together, deepening friendly feelings towards each other. After a day filled with smiles and handshakes watched around the world, the US committed to provide security guarantees to North Korea, while Pyongyang committed to work towards denuclearising the Korean peninsula.
Melissa Hanham of the US-based Center for Nonproliferation Studies said on Twitter that North Korea had already promised to do this many times, adding the two sides still dont agree on what denuclearisation means.
Asked about the issue -- the crux of the summit -- Trump said were starting that process which would begin very, very quickly, but gave no concrete details.
Speaking later as he flew out of Singapore bound for the US territory of Guam -- towards which Pyongyang last year threatened to lob missiles -- Trump said he intended to hold North Korea to its word on denuclearisation.
Were going to have to check it and we will check it. Well check it very strongly, he told reporters on Air Force One. - AFP

Major General (Rtd) Amal Karunasekera  further remanded
Former Military Intelligence Director and Army Chief of Staff Major General (Retired) Amal Karunasekara who was arrested in connection with the abduction and assault of former The Nations Newspaper Editor Keith Noyahr in 2008, was further remanded till June 26 by Mount Lavinia Additional Magistrate Lochana Abeywickrema yesterday.
Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appearing on behalf of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) yesterday, pleaded the Magistrate to direct Major General Karunasekara to the Colombo Chief Judicial Medical Officer.
SSC Girihagama also submitted that the suspect was being treated at the Prison hospital without any unhealthy condition. The Prison hospital should not be a privilege, but a right , SSC added.
The Magistrate ordered the Prison Superintendent to direct Major General Amal Karunasekara to the Colombo Chief Judicial Medical Officer and submit the full medical report before the Mount Lavinia Additional Magistrate.
Attorney- at-Law Shehan de Silva, appearing on behalf of Major General Karunasekara, pleaded that his client be granted bail.
However, SSC Girihagama objected to the suspect being granted bail. On a previous day, the Magistrate ordered Current Army Intelligence Director to direct the documents related to the safe house to the CID.
SSC Girihagama informed the Magistrate that current Army Intelligence Director Kodithuwakku had sent a letter stating that he was unable to provide those safe house documents to the CID, owing to National security concerns.
Due to this reason, SSC Girihagama pleaded the Magistrate to issue an order to the current Intelligence Director Kodithuwakku to have a discussion with the Attorney General, Magistrate and the CID officials.
After considering all matters, the Magistrate ordered the Current Intelligence Director Kodithuwakku to attend a discussion on the safe house document issue on June 26.
SSC Girihagama stated that when the CID Gang and Robbery Unit OIC Nishantha de Silva went to the Prison to take a statement from the suspect, he saw some documents in the possession of the suspect. When questioned about those documents, the suspect refused to reply to his questions, SSC added.
SSC Girihagama also pleaded with the Magistrate to issue an order to the Prison Superintend to hand over the names, identity card numbers, food taken and all other details of the persons who visit the suspect in Prison.
After considering SSC Girihagamas request, the Magistrate ordered the Prison Superintend to hand over those documents to the CID officials. The Magistrate fixed inquiries for June 26.

Mandatory retirement age should be raised from 55 to 65 years:Eran
The mandatory retirement age should be raised from 55 to 65, State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne said on Wednesday.
I am a strong advocate that the mandatory retirement age be increased from 55 to 65 years, he said. I see absolutely no rationale at 55 years for somebody to quit and then go on a consultancy.
He was speaking at an event marking the re-launch of the Sunrise Magazine, the official publication of the Sunrise Senior Foundation.
State Minister Wickramaratne noted that Sri Lanka had a unique problem among non-OECD countries, namely that its population was aging without a corresponding gain in income.
Meanwhile, the working-age population is coming down, as is the Labour - Force participation rate of women, he said.
(Its) a bomb of a kind, a kind that is increasing all of time, he added.
The current laws mandate that those working in the private sector retire at 55 years.
WHO Representative to Sri Lanka Dr. Razia Pendse argued that with longer life expectancies, it did not make sense to force people on to unfavourable consultant contracts after they turn 55.
This is perhaps when your contribution to society could be at its peak, she said.
State Minister Wickramaratne advocated for a re-thinking of old age.
There is hope, he said. And this is just another phase of life.

Massive campaign to plant jak saplings islandwide
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera inaugurated a massive campaign of planting ten lakhs of jak plants in the island on June 11 in Panadura.
Jak tree planting campaign had been launched by Arthur V. Dias in Panadura during the British War. His motive behind this initiative was to use the jak fruit as a substitute for rice when hungry. Thousands of school children, teachers together with the public supported his campaign and he was known among the school children as Kosmama.
Yahapalanaya Govt Ministry of Agriculture had decided to launch the massive campaign of planting 10 lakhs of jak plants in the country, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera launching the campaign in Panadura said.
The simple ceremony was held at the Panadura Jeramius Diyas Vidyalaya on June 11 remembering the 100 Anniversary of launching the jak planting campaign by late Arthur V. Dias who is a national hero in Panadura.

Gamage ruled out of Windies tour with hand fracture
Mathews coming home  for new arrival
Sri Lanka already without their consistent opener Dimuth Karunaratne due to a finger injury and one-nil down in the three-Test series suffered further body blows with their most experienced batter Angelo Mathews and fast bowler Lahiru Gamage both returning home and being ruled out for the rest of the series.
Angelo is returning home for personal reasons because his wife is expecting their second child. Gamage has suffered a fractured finger while batting in the first Test, said chief selector Graeme Labrooy.
The two players were due to return home yesterday. They will be replaced by fast bowling all-rounder Dasun Shanaka and batsman Danushka Gunathilaka who were expected to leave for the Caribbean last night.
Mathews who has scored just one Test hundred in his last 40 innings was dismissed for 11 and 35 in the first Test at Port of Spain which Sri Lanka lost by 226 runs. Due to his ongoing battle with injuries Mathews, a all-rounder was picked only for his batting for the series.
Gamage was rapped on the right gloves by a snorter from fast bowler Shannon Gabriel in the Sri Lanka second innings which later turned out to be a fracture.
As both Shanaka and Gunathilaka have been named in the Sri Lanka A team to tour Bangladesh starting later this month, Labrooy said that they will be replaced in the A team by the standbys picked for the tour.
The second Test against West Indies commences at Gros Islet today with top order batsman Dhananjaya de Silva set to return to the side after missing the first Test due to his fathers untimely death.
Whether Sri Lanka will want to replace Gamage with another fast bowler or a spinner would depend on the state of the pitch prepared for the Test.
Commenting on Sri Lankas loss in the first Test, Labrooy said the match was lost on the second day when Sri Lanka allowed West Indies last four wickets to add more than 150 runs recovering from 237-6 to 414-8 declared in their first innings.
We werent able to keep on the pressure built earlier and allowed them to post a competitive total, said Labrooy. Sri Lanka was dismissed for totals of 185 and 226. - ST

Mending  broken bonds
The greatest disease today is not TB or leprosy; it is being unwanted, unloved, and uncared for. We can cure physical diseases with medicine, but the only cure for loneliness, despair, and hopelessness is love. There are many in the world who are dying for a piece of bread but there are many more dying for a little love. Mother Teresa.
This year SOS Childrens Villages Sri Lanka celebrates 37 years of service in Sri Lanka. It was celebrated under the theme of 37 years of love, join hands today for their tomorrow. The work SOS Childrens Villages Sri Lanka has done is tremendous and splendid. They have enabled children facing all kinds of difficulties to grow up in an environment of love, nurturing them to become well balanced individuals who can contribute to society.
President of SOS Childrens Villages International,Siddhartha KaulPictures by Ruwan De Silva
President of SOS Childrens Villages International Siddhartha Kaul shared his thoughts and experiences provided to these children with the Daily News.
One in ten children around the world cannot tell you what it is like to have a father and mother or to have a family. UNICEF says over 220 million children around the world need care. If one in 10 do not know what it is like to have a father and mother, that makes it 22 million children around the world who do not know what it is like to have a father and mother, explained Kaul.
SOS Childrens Villages have been working to provide long term care to children who desperately need care. After World War II, the first Childrens village was built in 1949. Unfortunately today in 2018, there are more children who need care than there were in 1949. The reasons might have changed, but the need has increased tremendously. SOS Childrens Villages are now working with 135 countries in the world.
The cornerstones of the programs are children. For children who have lost their families and families who are on the verge of disintegrating. It could be poverty, war or social conflict  families which are breaking apart. We want to help these families to somehow stay together. Can we take care of everyone No. We dont have the resources. We are a private organization. But we can show a model, as to how to do it, and impress that upon the government that it is their responsibility to take care of the children. This will guarantee that these children can lead emotionally and financially sustainable adult lives, said Kaul.
Preparing the children for the world out there and teaching them to cope is very important.
It is not easy to cope with life if you have grown up alone. Almost all of us need some help or support. We need people we can trust. In Sri Lanka we have had difficult times like the JVP insurgency and the Civil War against the terrorists. But we have always been part of the community. The society has welcomed us. Our Village in Nuwara Eliya which has been there since 1982 has Sinhalese and Tamil families living together. But even at the height of the war we never had a conflict in the village. We were awarded the UNESCO Peace Messenger Prize for showing the way. During the JVP insurgency there were a lot of shutdowns. There was no food available. However the baker brought bread for the children in the village in the early hours of the morning. That was the kind of bond we had with the community, pointed out Kaul.
SOS Childrens Villages follow the UN guidelines for Alternative Care for Children  Whatever form of alternative care you use, you must have well defined standards and benchmarks. You must regularly monitor these standards and improve upon. Without monitoring there is no care system that is good.What you should not do is create a care system which is institutional  segregation of boys and girls.
We want to work with the governments. But we must also understand that Social Economic systems change. It is difficult to find money outside of the country. In 1981, when we started, we were getting all the money we needed from outside of Sri Lanka. Everyone thought that Sri Lanka needed help at that time but not anymore. They think Sri Lanka is a growing economy. But we say there is still a very large number of children in Sri Lanka who need help, added Kaul.
In many parts of the country there are unemployed young people who need different types of skills other than learning philosophy or ones involved in trying to get into university.
For the last few years, we did vocational programs in Anuradhapura and Monaragala. We started that in Jaffna. Around 1,600  1,700 young people both boys and girls graduated from these vocational training centers. They received a certification from the vocational training authority. Out of them 97 per cent are employed in either a company or in the Middle East or are entrepreneurs, stated Kaul.
What SOS Childrens Villages are trying to do is to point out to the government and people of Sri Lanka, that they have a responsibility and duty towards the children of Sri Lanka.
We need to put in more resources and energy into taking care of children. For all this we need money. The governments have to put in money. We are constantly in dialogue with the government authorities. I had a discussion with the Prime Minister to notify him and he was very sympathetic. It is the right of these children to receive proper care. Do you want your society to be known as a society that takes care of its children One of our biggest countries for programs is Germany. The local bodies there recognize that it is the responsibility of the state to take care of its children. But simultaneously they recognize that they are not competent to take care of the children.
Jaffna VTC opening with Siddhartha Kaul and his visit to the Anuradhapura Children center
They have the money but not the human resources. They do not have the knowledge. So they look for NGOs who can handle this. They invite the NGOs to take care of the children, explained Kaul.
So you become a partner with the government. You work with the government, designing your programs. You implement the program and the program is financed by the government. The governments set the standards and do the evaluation but we run the program. And in doing so we submit ourselves to a full and monitoring evaluation by the government, said Kaul.
When SOS Childrens Villages Sri Lanka started in 1981, the majority of children who came in for care were abandoned or single parent children. Today the majority of children, who come for long term care, come from broken families. It may be substance abuse, domestic violence or it may be that they are in conflict with the law. So SOS Childrens Villages need to provide them with the healing process.
When compared to other countries, Sri Lanka is very far behind when it comes to raising financial resources. Sri Lankans give a lot of money, but not for our type of work. Maybe they give a lot of money for religious activities. But where the quality of care is concerned, Sri Lanka is second to none. We have a very good group of SOS mothers. By 2023 we hope to improve this situation, said Kaul.
The realities faced by children throughout the world
*220 million children globally are growing up without adequate care and support
* The estimated number of children who have lost one or both parents is 153 million globally.
* Out of these approximately 43 million children are living in South Asia.
* According to the Childs Rights Situation Analysis in 2014, the number of orphaned and abandoned children is 10,000. Stats related to SOS Villages in Sri Lanka
* SOS childrens villages in Sri Lanka are in total six  Anuradhapura, Galle, Monaragala, Nuwara Eliya, Piliyandala and Jaffna currently housing over 800 children.
* The Family Strengthening Program (FSP) helps disadvantaged families stay together taking action to strengthen families and communities so they can adequately care for their children. Currently there are over 3,000 families under this program.
*SOS Childrens Villages Sri Lanka has enabled the low income earning youth to enroll in a skill development program at the Vocational Training Center (VTC).
*The Jaffna VTC was declared open on June 10, 2018.
* In addition to providing care the objective of the SOS Childrens Villages Sri Lanka is to in still values such as courage, commitment, trust and accountability, to make the youth well rounded individuals in society.

Mihin Lanka breached BOI conditions - official
The Presidential Commission investigating alleged fraud, corruption and misuse of state funds and property in SriLankan Airlines, Sri Lankan Catering Services and Mihin Lanka yesterday ordered the CID to investigate whether any outside interference prevented the BOI from taking action against Mihin Lanka.
It was found that Mihin Lanka was acting in breach of all BOI conditions. The Commission asked the CID to submit a report to the Commission on this matter urgently.
The Commission through Deputy Solicitor General Shanaka Wijesinghe directed the CID to begin the investigation by visiting the BOI and meeting its monitoring officer. The CID responding to this order began its investigations by noon yesterday.
BOI Director (Investment) Gamini Jayatilleke giving evidence led by Deputy Solicitor General Shanaka Wijesinghe said Mihin Lanka had breached BOI conditions and failed to respond to reminders made by the BOI.
He said he was unaware why the BOI failed to take any action on the matter. Mihin Lanka Chief Executive Kapila Chandrasena had sent a letter dated February 26, 2009 to the BOI making several requests. They were to reduce the investment of 100 million US dollars to 50 million US dollars. Reduce Rs. 616 billion investment to Rs. 3,616 million and to reduce the foreign exchange income from 70 percent to 40 percent.
Although the BOI had asked him to show cause for his request and made several reminders later, there had been no response from Mihin Lanka.

National captains and cricket stars praise the Mega Show
Voting for the most popular contests of the 40th Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year mega show has taken a new turn with the final few weeks battle for the three crowns that would be decided on popularity.
There has been heavy voting in the last couple of weeks and the battle for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title, awarded under three divisions, is expected to be a keen battle for supremacy in the weeks to come.
Over the past four decades, the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest, has turned out to be an integral part of Sri Lankas school cricket, considered to be one of the best in the world.
Since its inception way back in 1979, the countrys first and the foremost school cricket awards show has turned out to be one of the most sought-after events in local sports calendar. That is mainly due to the fact that the Mega Show has produced some of the legendary cricketers who have played for Sri Lanka with distinction.
This was how some of the former Sri Lanka captains and star cricketers had expressed their views on the Mega Show in recent times:
Chief Match Referee of ICC and former Sri Lanka captain, RANJAN MADUGALLE:
It was great to feel that your hard work as a schoolboy cricketer is appreciated at the end of the season. It is a great inspiration and a satisfaction to feel that your performances are recognized. It is not merely for individual glory but your performances as a team. I was honoured and privileged to be adjudged the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer at its inaugural show in 1979. In fact, we even didnt know that there was such an award on offer. We played traditional friendly matches to enjoy the game and not for competition or personal glory.
Sri Lankas World Cup-winning captain turned Cabinet Minister, ARJUNA RANATUNGA:
Winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award at the end of a season is the dream of every schoolboy cricketer. Its great for the Sunday Observer to conduct the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Contest since 1979 to encourage the budding schoolboy cricketers. I was particularly happy to see that the Northern Province joining with the others in the competitions at the contest. I am delighted to see the improvement of outstation cricket as the game has spread far and wide in the country. Many Sri Lankan cricketing giants of the past and the present are those who have either won the prestigious and coveted Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Award or won other awards at the contest.
Former Sri Lanka captain and ex-ICC Match Referee ROSHAN MAHANAMA:
Becoming the best schoolboy cricketer and being honoued for our hard work was a great encouragement. I was privileged to achieve one of my dreams. That was my stepping stone. Becoming the best schoolboy cricketer made me even more determined to work harder to reach greater heights. As a kid, I had watched former Nalanda players such as Bandula Warnapura in action. We had full houses for all those inter-school games. It was a passion.
Sri Lanka High Performance Manager and ex-national player ASANKA GURUSINHA:
The Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year show has not only produced top cricketers but some international level umpires such as Kumar Dharmasena who serves in the ICC elite panel. It is not an award that everybody could win. One has to perform exceptionally well and be consistent right throughout a season to win that  work really hard to reach the pinnacle of school career.
We should also thank school coaches and masters-in-charge who render a yeoman service.
Ex- Sri Lanka captain and current Sri Lanka U-19 coach HASHAN TILLAKARATNE:
There is a great feeling when you know that your hard efforts would be rewarded at the end of a school season. Appearing at the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer victory podium is a great feeling for any schoolboy cricketer. The organisers the Sunday Observer of Lake House and its present sponsor SLT Mobitel deserves credit for recognizing the school talent. School cricket is the stepping stone for club cricket and to the Sri Lanka national pool thereafter. It is important that we encourage and inspire them to march to the next level.
Former Sri Lanka captain and ex-Chairman of Selectors SANATH JAYASURIYA:
Winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title has been the dream of every schoolboy cricketer from the good old days. When I won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year outstation title, I thought I should stand a greater chance of playing for Sri Lanka, if I continue to focus on the game with dedication and devotion. It inspired me to go places. Once you win this coveted title, you only need commitment and dedication to find a place in the Sri Lanka team,
Former Sri Lanka captain and ex-national coach MARVAN ATAPATTU:
As a student at Ananda, playing junior cricket, I witnessed the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year awards show in 1982. I saw our school captain at that time Arjuna Ranatunga emerging out of a huge cricket ball, erected on stage, to receive the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award. That was a great inspiration to me and I thought that I too could make my family, the team and my school proud if I could emulate that feat one fine day. Things worked well for me to bring that honour to Ananda eight years later. Almost all those who have won top awards at the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year show have stepped into the national team in next to no time and many of them have established their mark as top national players.
Former Sri Lanka cricketer turned ICC Elite Panel Umpire, KUMAR DHARMASENA:
The Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title which I won in 1989 inspired me to step into the international arena with confidence. It was one of the greatest moments in my career as a cricketer. Winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title was a big inspiration. That helped and encouraged me to play for Sri Lanka. If you dont enjoy the game and dedicate yourself towards it, you wont be successful. Believe in yourself, work hard with dedication and you will find success.
Current Sri Lanka cricketer NIROSHAN DICKWELLA:
It gives me great pleasure to find that the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest has been held for four decades. This important event has produced a galaxy of national stars. Most of the recipients of this prestigious award are doing well in their chosen professions, be it in cricket or otherwise. My best wishes for a successful run of the contest in the future. Winning the award was a great encouragement for me when I was playing for Trinity College.
Meanwhile, voting for the most popular segments of the 40th Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contests continues under three divisions. Voting for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contests could be made through voting coupons which continue to appear in the Daily News, Sunday Observer, Dinamina and Thinakaran.
It is heartening to see the Mega Show is completing its 40th anniversary this year. Most importantly, the countrys national mobile service provider has been associated with Sri Lankas first-ever school cricket awards show for 11 years.
Together with Sri Lanka Telecom and SLT Mobitel management headed by its Chief Executive Officer Nalin Perera are extending the fullest support to make the Mother of all Shows a resounding success once again as it continues to remain the dream of every schoolboy cricketer!

New programme to boost soil productivity by FAO
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and its Global Soil Partnership launched today a new programme to boost soil productivity and reduce soil degradation for greater food and nutrition security in Africa.
The Afrisoils programme aims to increase soil productivity in 47 African countries by 30 percent, and reduce soil degradation by 25 percent in the next ten years.
Africa is the second driest continent, with nearly half of its surface made up of desert, and 40 percent of it affected by desertification.
About 65 percent of the continents farm land is affected by erosion-induced losses of topsoil and soil nutrients. If soils are severely damaged or lost, they are very difficult and costly to restore and rehabilitate.
On top of this, less than half of Africas land is suitable for agriculture, and of this, only 16 percent is of high quality.
Faced with these challenges, despite progress in improving agriculture, Africa as a whole remains largely food insecure, directly affecting 70 percent of its population who rely on the little available land to grow food and make a living.
Out of the 815 million undernourished people globally, 243 million are from Africa.

New Zealand cricket legend  Hadlee has cancer surgery
Wellington, Wednesday: New Zealand cricketing great Richard Hadlee has undergone surgery for bowel cancer but is expected to make a full recovery, his wife Dianne said Wednesday.
"Last month, Richard had a routine, three-year colonoscopy, and we discovered that he has bowel cancer," she said in a statement.
"He has since had an operation to remove the tumour.
This operation went extremely well and he has made an excellent recovery from surgery."
Dianne Hadlee said that as a safeguard, the 66-year-old fast bowling legend would soon commence chemotherapy treatment and "it is expected that, in time, he will have a full recovery".
Hadlee is regarded as one of the greatest fast bowlers of all time, and was the first to take 400 Test wickets. By the time he retired in 1990, he had played 86 Tests and taken 431 wickets at 22.29.
He was also a hard-hitting batsman with a Test career total of 3,124 runs, including two centuries and 15 half-centuries, at an average of 27.16. AFP

NOTHING LESS THAN  BRILLIANT
If Im ever stranded on a desert island and am given a chance to pick any writer I would like to share the island with I would most probably choose Martin Amis (Ian McEwan comes a close second though). Martin Amis and I have a lot in common. Like me, he is the offspring of an accomplished writer. Like me, he too followed in his fathers footsteps and became a writer. But what fascinates me about him is that unlike me, he is totally immune to the negative comments critics make of his books. If I ever get to meet him I would like to find out if he is really as indifferent to criticism as he shows in public or if its all pretense.
A whole lot of wistful thinking, of course. For Martin Amis currently lives on the other side of the world, in his mother-in-laws house, a grand, many-storeyed residence in downtown Manhattan. There is little hope our paths would ever cross. Not even if he moves from his present residence, to which he and his wife, the novelist Isabel Fonseca, decamped after a fire wrecked their home, because it is to Brooklyn that they are planning to move. In his characteristic fashion, he and Isabel have, he says, been lucky in all sorts of ways. They can almost laugh about the fire now, at least at Isobels initial reaction. She was in Florida when it happened, and when Amis called to tell her the house was on fire and there were six fire engines outside, she said, in total panic, When the firemen come, could you ask them to take off their boots before they go upstairs
Today, at the age of sixty-eight, having moved from London to New York, Martin Amis says these days he is working on an autobiographical novel. It wont, however, be a memoirhe has already written one of those, called Experience, which was published in 2000. Amis describes what he is working on now as a book that falls under the broad umbrella of life writing.
This new venture comes as no surprise because Amis has never been just one sort of writer. He is arguably most recognized as the masterful novelist behind Money and London Fields, but he is also an essayist and a critic. His most recent book, The Rub of Time, is evidence of his many talents. The book is a collection of essays, literary criticism, and reportage published in the New Yorker, the Guardian, the Atlantic Monthly, and elsewhere between 1986 and 2017.
Talking about his role as a critic Amis says When I dispraise,I am usually quoting clich. When I praise, I am usually quoting the opposed qualities of freshness, energy, and reverberation of voice. He judges literature by this criterion. In fact, across The Rub of Time he evaluates seemingly everything on the basis of whether it strikes his eyes and ears as fresh or dull. As fate would have it even Jane Austen doesnt fit his high standards. He is impatient with the worshipers of her six samey novels, and says satire is militant irony. Irony is long-suffering. It doesnt incite you to transform society; it strengthens you to tolerate it. This is a quietism that Austen never went beyond, and Amis says he rather wishes she had.
In 1999, in an interview with Radio National he succinctly summed up the feelings of the book reviewer. When you review an exhibition of paintings you dont compose a painting about it, when you review a film you dont make a film about it and when you review a new CD you dont make a little CD about it. But when you review a prose-narrative then you write a prose-narrative about that prose-narrative and those who write the secondary prose-narrative, lets face it, must have once had dreams of writing the primary prose-narrative.
Born on August 25, 1949, in Oxford, England, where his father, the Booker Prizewinning author Sir Kingsley Amis, was a doctoral student, Martin Amis grew up in the various university towns in which his father taught literature: Swansea, Princeton and Cambridge. His parents divorced when he was twelve.
At eighteen, a role in the film A High Wind in Jamaica took him to the West Indies. He returned to England in 1968 and, after taking crammers he enrolled in Exeter College, Oxford. He graduated with first-class honors in English. In his early twenties, he wrote book reviews for the London Observer and soon thereafter worked as an editorial assistant for The Times Literary Supplement. His first novel,The Rachel Papers, was published in 1973 and received critical acclaim, winning the Somerset Maugham Award (a prize his father had also been awarded). While at the TLS, he published his second novel,Dead Babies(1975), which Auberon Waugh referred to as nothing less than brilliant. 
From 1977 to 1980 he served as literary editor of The New Statesman, a socialist weekly, and wrote two more novels, Success(1978) and Other People(1981). In 1984, his best-selling Money appeared, followed by a collection of journalism, The Moronic Inferno (1986), and a collection of short stories, Einsteins Monsters (1987), which focused on the nuclear threat as did London Fields (1990) where he predicts the death of the planet. One critic described London Fields as ferociously impressive. Amis subsequently published another collection of journalism, Visiting Mrs. Nabokov, and a novel, Times Arrow (1992).
After his first marriage to Antonia Phillips came to an end in 1993  he left her for Isobel  Amis has led a life low in drama. He has always been a domestic creature, even when his children were young, preferring to work in the house, as his father, Kingsley did, rather than go to an office. Being a father of four, he says, fatherhood has been vitally important to his life as a novelist. I did want kids. I was completely fed up with being single as well. I wanted to see a fresh face. Having children cant help but open you out.
Asked by the Guardian what kind of parent he was when his kids were young Amis explains he was never a shouter. Anger isnt my thing. When his boys were misbehaving, their mother, his first wife, would tell him to go in and lay down the law, but on the rare occasions he did, it didnt go well. Both my wives were capable of having a good shriek, but I cant do it. It bores me, which is infuriating to my wife.
If so, how does he express anger I have a mannerism that drives my wife crazy. He laughs, looks away and does a mild tut. But, he says, I do feel that, along with a harmonious marriage, having a good relationship with your children is the main bit.
Finally to the most important question of all. How does he remain indifferent in the eye of heavy criticism His answer is simple even though practicing it might not be easy.
One of the perks of being the son of a writer is not that you come automatically equipped to write novels, its that you dont bother much about praise. Kingsley never bothered much about praise and dispraise.

Romesh tipped to retain Havelock SC presidency
Romesh Abeyawickrema is tipped to come in as president of Havelock Sports Club for another term. He will be elected at the 103rd Annual General Meeting which is set for 24 June at 11 am at the club house. The outgoing committee recommend the former Josephian sportsman to continue, as president for 2018/19 . Havelock SC founded in 1915 has a long history of rugby as the club's main sporting activity. In the good old days they had hockey and football too. They have their ground known as Havelock Park. Romesh hopes to continue the untiring efforts and good work done by many past rugby presidents
The club has produced some excellent players over the last few decades in the field of rugby, but in the last few years has struggled to retain its players with their good performers crossing over to other clubs. This club was inaugurated when 27 schoolboys from ages ranging from 12 to 16 years whose homes were in the vicinity of Havelock Park agreed to organize themselves into a club and thus the Havelock Sports Club came into existence.
The club had no constitution, no office bearers, no materials, no grounds, nothing but enthusiasm and comradeship. The inspiration and keenness for all this came from none other than a boy named Roy Joachim. In 1915 Roy together with the other boys got about setting up the club never dreaming that their juvenile efforts would reach maturity and that the club would live to take its place in the front ranks of the local sports celebrating 103 years this year. During that time tennis ball cricket and football were played regularly and were the most favored sports. Hockey was introduced at a later stage. Gradually interest in rugby grew and became popular and dominated all activities.
After the 2nd World War, when rugby was revived in 1949, Havelock SC became unofficial champions. And were the first Clifford Cup champions in 1950 unbeaten. The following year 1951, under Ian Labrooy in these two years no club crossed their goal line. Their next Clifford Cup win was in 1961 under Dr. Hubert Aloysius.
They won many a trophy at hockey also the Andriesz Shield in 1935 and 1960, the Pioneer Cup in 1950 and 1955 and first winners of the Bacon Cup in 1947 and several other trophies.
Down the years the club expanded and membership increased and they started their own club house, and the Colombo Municipal Council sanction could not be obtained for a permanent building which resulted in a compact cabin-like structure mounted on wheels being built. In August 1959, the new club house was declared open after the Municipal Council approved the grant.
Havelock SC was a top rugby playing club and dominated the game in the 1960-1980s. It was the breeding ground for most of the young school leavers who later enlisted themselves at the Park club to progress forward in the sport. In recent times under the presidency of Asanga Seneviratne the ground was made a floodlit stadium.
The new committee will comprise: Patron Gamini Fernando, Vice Patrons: Lal Silva, Ana Saranapala, Jeyer Rodriguez, Dan Ratnam, Anton Benedict, Wimal Senanayake, Y.C. Chang, Killi Pulendran.

Russia to win first World Cup match, says clairvoyant cat
MOSCOW, Wednesday: Russia's football team has failed to chalk up a single victory in eight months but things could be about to improve -- according to a supposedly clairvoyant cat who predicted a win for the side in the first World Cup match.
Achilles, a deaf white cat who is the official animal soothsayer for the tournament, on Wednesday chose a bowl of food bearing the host's flag rather than that of Saudi Arabia, who Russia will face on Thursday evening.
The blue-eyed feline is usually part of a team of dozens of cats that guard Saint Petersburg's Hermitage museum from rodents, but has taken on a new role for the football event.
"Achilles is already used to the public and shouldn't be too stressed," said vet Anna Kondratyeva, who manages the animals.
The cat follows in the tentacle-prints of Paul the Octopus who became a star in 2010 after predicting winners for that year's World Cup by choosing one out of two boxes containing food.
Others have made a play to be the next Paul -- including Swiss guinea pig Madame Shiva in 2014 and British Piranha Pele -- but none quite had the mollusc's foresight.
Earlier in the day the head of the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill said he would pray for the national team to give a worthy performance.
The hosts, who take on Saudi Arabia in the Thursday curtainraiser, need all the moral support they can get as they come into the event without a win in seven games. - AFP

Maliyadeva, Science promoted to A division with Thomians and Antonians
S. Thomas ML wins league Plate, St. Anthonys runner-up
S.Thomas College Mount Lavinia defeated D.S. Senanayake College Colombo at Havelock Park after a hard fought battle to be crowned Singer B Division inter-school rugby Plate champions and thereby gain promotion to the Singer A Division tournament next year.
The Mount Lavinia boys were expected to be given a tough fight by DSS and it was a very close match as the Thomians finished on top in the last move of the day scoring the match winning try through second row forward Harith Senanayake to post a 24-19 win.
The DSS outfit that had fared well during the season didnt have much luck coming their way.
Thomian captain cum flanker Christian de Lile led from the front. He scored a superb break away try to continue his fine form displayed throughout the season. Number eight Lashanra de Silva, wing three quarter Sadak Ishak and second row forward Harith Senanayake too were in the thick of the game and added their names to the try list towards the end. At half-time S. Thomas led 12-5.
For D.S. Senanayake, centre Mafaz Brantha, wingers Saranga Udawatta and Lalanka Wijesundara scored the tries.
The Thomians have won all their games and remained unbeaten throughout the Plate championship.
St. Anthonys thrash Dharmaraja
St. Anthonys College Kandy thrashed home town rival Dharmaraja College Kandy by 32 points to 12 in a one-sided battle after leading 12-7 at lemons at Bogambara grounds, Kandy. With this win they became the Plate championship runners-up and got them self promoted to the A Division next year.
The Antonians defended with a lot of heart which paid off in the end to register this grand victory. They scored their tries through Ishara Liyanage, Suhail Waseem, Mohamed Makarim, K.D Seneviratne and Dulanjana Dharmasiri.
Their left footed full back Chamod Wanasinghe slotted in two conversions and a solitary penalty for the winners.
M. P Hiripitiya scored two tries and the conversion was fired across by skipper Bawantha Udangamuva for the Rajans.
Maliyadeva stun Science
Maliyadeva College Kurunegala pulled off a stunner against much fancied Science College Mount Lavinia by 29 points to 19 at Pallekelle, Kandy to secure third place in the Singer B Division Plate championship and thereby earn promotion to play in the A Division next year.
This is the first time a schools rugby team from Kurunegala will play in the 'A' Division after veteran school rugby coach Santhi Martis coached St. Annes College, Kurunegala to victory in 1995 and earn promotion to play in the 'A' division the following year.
Science were really lucky and managed to be placed fourth thus getting the required last slot to be promoted to play in the schools A Division next year.
Vidyartha rout Lumbini
Vidyartha College Kandy routed Lumbini College Colombo by 57-20 in their inter school rugby game played in Pallekelle, Kandy after holding on to a 33-6 lead at lemons.

Same goal,  different paths
The next presidential election is not due until January 2020- eighteen months from now- but, judging by the posturing of major political parties and the rhetoric that is being bandied about, it seems that the campaign for the poll is already underway.
That the contest is between the United National Party (UNP), the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is a foregone conclusion. However, it is still anyones guess whether there will be an eleventh-hour reconciliation between the SLFP and the SLPP.
In a bid to strengthen his hold on the SLFP and appease SLFP dissidents to some extent, President Maithripala Sirisena made key changes to the party structure earlier this month. The major change was replacing General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake with Professor Rohana Laxman Piyadasa.
In accepting the appointment, Piyadasa, whose specialty is mass communications, committed an inadvertent faux pas. Flanked by the President at his side, Piyadasa said President Mahinda Rajapaksa and quickly corrected himself. As the video clip of the slip of the tongue went viral on social media, the irony was not lost on SLFPers: many of them are in a mindset where they still regard Rajapaksa as their leader.
Since the restructuring of the SLFP, Dissanayake has come out swinging, declaring that President Sirisena will be the partys presidential candidate in 2020. The statement was made at a briefing where Piyadasa was also present and many are regarding this as an almost official declaration of the Presidents candidacy- if that was ever in doubt. Dissanayake also called for the formation of a broad coalition to support the President.
This announcement has drawn an angry response from the SLPP. Its chairman, former minister G.L. Peiris quite categorically stated that the party will not support President Sirisenas candidature. Peiris claimed that despite the restructuring of the party, it appeared that Dissanayake was still announcing party policy.
Group of sixteen
Peiris also called upon the so-called group of sixteen- those SLFPers, including ministers, who voted against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the recent motion of no-confidence and subsequently quit the government to sit in the opposition- to decide on their political future.
The group, which include SLFP seniors S. B. Dissanayake, John Seneviratne and Susil Premajayantha, claim that they are independent but there is growing speculation that they will cast their lot with the Rajapaksa and the SLPP shortly. Peiriss remarks appeared to be an invitation for this course of action.
The group of sixteen is not without its own share of problems. Foremost among them is the plight of former minister in charge of sports, Dayasiri Jayasekara, who has been found accepting a one million rupee donation from a company affiliated with Perpetual Treasuries Limited which is at the centre of investigations into irregularities into the sale of Central Bank bonds.
Previously, while within the government, Jayasekara was a forthright campaigner against the alleged bond scam. Now exposed as having accepted a donation of questionable integrity, Jayasekara states that such donations are the norm in politics. Investigations are continuing and Jayasekara was grilled for several hours by Police earlier this week.
In the SLPP, much of the attention has been focussed on who its presidential candidate would be because the 19th Amendment to the Constitution bars Mahinda Rajapaksa from running for a third term. The clear frontrunner is former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
Gotabhaya Rajapaksa recently made the keynote address at a conference of Viyath Maga, a network of professionals and entrepreneurs. Most interpreted this as a manifesto of sorts for his potential candidacy. UNP front-liner Mangala Samaraweera was quick to lampoon it, labelling it Vipath Maga.
A further indication of Gotabhaya Rajapaksas intentions came this week when Udaya Gammanpila, leader of the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya, called a media briefing. Gammanpila said Rajapaksa had requested him to explain the true legal position and the procedure in respect of renunciation of the US citizenship.
Rajapaksa is presently a dual citizen of the United States and Sri Lanka and the 19th Amendment prevents dual citizens from seeking high political office in the country. Gammanpilas effort appeared to be an exercise designed to allay concerns in some quarters about Rajapaksas eligibility to run for President. This was the most overt indication yet that Rajapaksa has his eyes firmly set on contesting the Presidency.
Gotabhaya Rajapaksas candidacy
In a related development, the rumour mill went into overdrive when outgoing United States envoy Atul Keshap called on Mahinda Rajapaksa on Sunday. Even sections of the mainstream media reported that Keshap had suggested that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was unpopular.
However, both Mahinda Rajapaksas office and the United States embassy in Colombo have denied these reports, maintaining that the meeting was merely a courtesy call by the outgoing ambassador on the former President.
Interestingly, SLPP Chairman Peiris, when asked about Gotabhaya Rajapaksas candidacy, was non-committal. Peiris maintained that a final decision regarding the SLPP candidate would be made by Mahinda Rajapaksa at the appropriate time.
The UNP has however already reacted to the possibility of the younger Rajapaksa as a candidate. Minister Harin Fernando, who is also the partys propaganda chief, said it would be easier for the UNP if Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was the rival candidate. We have many things to tell the people about former the defence secretary and we will do so at the right time, Fernando said, adding that Rajapaksa always does things through militarisation.
However, the UNP too has been saddled with the woes of the Central Bank bond sale controversy, with State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe being revealed as being among those who received a three million rupee donation from a company associated with Perpetual Treasuries Limited.
Since the revelation, Senasinghe has been in damage control mode, offering to resign if his party requested him to do so and stating he would donate the money to the Dalada Maligawa. Senasinghe also appeared in a television talk show and the consensus was that he did himself more harm through that appearance, trying to defend and justify his actions in a belligerent manner, instead of being contrite.
Adding to the partys problems is the arrest of Yashodha Bandara, son of State Minister Palitha Range Bandara. He is being charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and misusing state property after he met with a serious accident.
In the midst of these controversies, the UNP leadership was also mindful of keeping its parliamentarians happy. That was why five UNP MPs were sworn in as state ministers and deputy ministers this week. There had been concerns that UNP backbenchers, dissatisfied with the recent reforms in the party, were planning to go public with their complaints.
UNP General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has announced that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will be the partys candidate for the 2020 presidential election. The one plus point for the UNP is that, unlike with the SLFP and the SLPP, no one from the party has publicly challenged this proposition.
What is clear at this stage is that the coalition government in its present form will continue, most likely until the presidential election, if only for the reason that there is no alternative. However, as the countdown for the election approaches, there is every likelihood of its partners embarking on different political directions to further their prospects at the poll.

Sampath Bank launches Wewata Jeewayak program
As a Bank that takes pride in its Sri Lankan roots, Sampath Bank has always appreciated the immense value that the Wewa system adds to the country. Right from its inception, the Bank has been working with authorities and local communities to restore tanks around the island through its Wewata Jeewayak program.
As part of its Wewata Jeevayak initiative, the Bank joined hands with the Divisional Irrigation Engineers Office, Minneriya, and the Divulankadawala Govi Samithiya to restore the Danyawa Wewa in Divulankadawala, Medirigiriya, recently.
The Divisional Irrigation Engineer Minneriya, officers of the Divisional Secretariat Office, other senior government officers and representatives of the Govi Samithiya were at the ceremonial inauguration of the project together with officers and customers of Sampath Bank and members of the Madirigiriya and Higurakgoda communities.
Today, the Danyawa Wewaserves as the main irrigation source for 96 families carrying out farming on over 112 acres of paddy fields across 3 villages in the region. Its streams provide water for drinking and other household purposes to about 225 families in neighboring villages. Furthermore, students of the Divulankadawala Central College also get their drinking water from the tanks streams.
The Danyawa Wewa has great cultural significance too with pilgrims on route to Medirigirya during Poson stopping by and having a bath in it.
Over the years, the tank has become shallow due to the accumulation of sludge and the lack of proper maintenance. Its water retention capacity has been further hampered due to damages to the sluice and canal, which has resulted in water leaking through the sluice gate.
Under the Wewate Jeevayak effort, Sampath Bank will provide the funding required for the complete restoration of the tank with members of its Hingurakgoda Branch overseeing the project. They will work together with the Minneriya Divisional Irrigation Engineers Office and members of the Divulankadawala Govi Samithiya to remove the sludge accumulated in the tank, repair its sluice gate and construct bathing places. Once completed, it will help secure year round water supply for the Madirigiriya and Higurakgoda communities
Drawing inspiration from these tanks and other historic traditions, we at Sampath Bank too seek to help people save more and prosper. We are committed to going beyond serving as a trusted financial service provider and adding value to the communities we operate in, said Lalith Weragoda, Assistant General Manager (AGM) - Human Resources, Sampath Bank.

Samsung, LG to bring full-screen, sound emitting smartphones
Smartphones featuring thin-bezel display panels are quite common nowadays. They majorly include a notch design that accommodates an earpiece as well as frontal sensors, such as the selfie camera, ambient light, and proximity sensor. But now, Samsung and LG are found to be working on the next level of smartphones that may come with a truly full-screen experience.
The technology, which is at the pilot stage, was showcased at the Display Week 2018 late last month. It is already rumoured that the Galaxy S10 flagship will come with a piezoelectric speaker, similar to the newly launched Vivo Nex series and the Xiaomi Mi Mix, to give a more display space than its predecessor.
Samsung Display and LG Display are set to commercialise their full-screen OLED display technology by early next year, reports ETNews, citing people familiar with the development. The new technology is said to eliminate transmitters to deliver a full-screen experience - without requiring a notch to include a dedicated earpiece or sensors.
At the Display Week event in May, Samsung exhibited a full-screen OLED prototype that it formally called Sound on Display. The prototype, which measures 6.2-inch in size, does not require a separate earpiece and produces the sound by vibrating the panel. This helps to offer an entire edge-to-edge display experience. The transmission bandwidth of the panel is reported to come between the 100 8000Hz range. Further, the sound is audible only when the users place their ear on the display. This could help to make your conversations as private as they are through a traditional earpiece.
Alongside Samsung, LG showcased its 88-inch 8K OLED display at CES 2018 in January with a Crystal Sound OLED integration. The technology helps to emanate sound directly from the panel.
The South Korean company could bring the same experience to small screens and enable sound-emanating smartphones to take on the competition.
Earlier this month, it was reported that the Samsung Galaxy S10 will come with a piezoelectric speaker that will sit under the display panel to produce sound. The advanced speaker will not require an earpiece and will use piezoelectric vibrations to emit sound through the screen.
Notably, Xiaomi brought its Mi Mix with a full-screen panel and the absence of an earpiece back in October 2016. While the Mi maker switched back to a more conventional earpiece on the Mi Mix 2, Vivo recently brought the Nex A and Nex S handsets with a Screen SoundCasting technology that omits the earpiece and generates the sound through a micro-vibration unit.
The new Vivo models also include an elevating camera sensor that pops up from the top to let users capture their selfies or make video calls. All thisenables a complete bezel-less experience. (Gadgets)

Sarfraz special floors Scotland
Scotland were unable to repeat the heroics which earned them a first-ever ODI victory over England as Pakistan produced a dominant all-round display at The Grange.
Sarfraz Ahmed won the toss and unsurprisingly chose to bat first at a ground that had witnessed 736 runs when the Scots defeated England in a 50-over contest two days previously.
Towering seamer Alasdair Evans (3/23) made an early breakthrough when he dismissed Ahmed Shehzad for 14 and the hosts would have been reasonably happy to keep Pakistan to 87/3 in the 11th over, with Fakhar Zaman (21) and Hussain Talat (18) failing to make the most of strong starts.
However, from there Pakistan motored, with their captain Sarfraz (89* from 49) and Shoaib Malik (53 off 27) repeatedly peppering the short boundaries.
The pair hit eight sixes between them (three to Safraz and five to Shoaib) as the tourists amassed 204/4  their second-highest total in the format, just one shy of the 205/3 they hit against the Windies in Karachi two months ago. Evans was the only bowler to keep a lid on Pakistan's batsmen, with Safyaan Sharif, Mark Watt and the debutant left-arm spinner Hamza Tahir all going at more than 10 an over.
Nonetheless, Scotland started their reply in positive fashion and the home fans dared to dream once again as captain Kyle Coetzer (31 off 18) and debutant George Munsey (25 off 22) took the hosts to 53/0 in 5.1 overs.

Saudi women rev up motorbikes as end to driving ban nears
Riyadh, Tuesday: Even a year ago, it would have been hard to imagine -- Saudi women clad in skinny jeans and Harley-Davidson T-shirts, revving motorbikes at a Riyadh sports circuit.
But ahead of the historic lifting of a decades-long ban on female drivers on June 24, women gather weekly at the privately owned Bikers Skills Institute, to learn how to ride bikes.
Biking has been a passion ever since I was a kid, said 31-year-old Noura, who declined to give her real name as she weighs public reactions in the ultra-conservative Islamic kingdom.
Overturning the worlds only ban on female drivers, long a symbol of repression against women, is the most striking reform yet launched by powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
But it has been overshadowed by a wave of arrests of female activists -- including veteran campaigners who long resisted the ban.
None of the women at the floodlit motoring circuit wanted to talk about the crackdown, a deeply sensitive issue, focusing instead on securing a basic freedom long denied to them.
I grew up watching my family riding bikes, Noura told AFP as she mounted a Yamaha Virago.
Now I hope... to have enough skills to ride on the street.
Next to her, revving a Suzuki, sat Leen Tinawi, a 19-year-old Saudi-born Jordanian.
For both women, biking is not just an adrenalin-fuelled passion, but also a form of empowerment.
I can summarise the whole experience of riding a bike in one word -- freedom, Tinawi said.
Both bikers follow their Ukrainian instructor, 39-year-old Elena Bukaryeva, who rides a Harley-Davidson.
Most days the circuit is the domain of drag racers and bike enthusiasts -- all men.
But since offering courses to women in February on the basics of bike riding, four female enthusiasts have enrolled, most of them Saudis, Bukaryeva said.
They always wanted to learn how to ride a motorcycle. And now they are saying its my time, Bukaryeva told AFP

SLASA officers to strike today
The Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association (SLASA) is to engage in a strike today (14), demanding the government for the special allowance.
A silent protest would also be held in front of the Ministry of Public Administration and Management today at 10 am.
SLASA Secretary Rohana de silva said that all Administrative officers would be on sick leave tomorrow, in order to pressure the government and added that further measures would be taken depending on the decision given by the Minister.
He said that a proposal on the special allowance for Administrative Officers approved by the Salaries and Cadre Commission and was presented to the Cabinet last week, but they had once again referred the matter to a Cabinet sub committee.
This happened once before as well. In 2015, a proposal was presented to the Cabinet and they did the same. It has been 3 years and nothing had happened so far. We fear the same thing is going to happen again. This time we need a definite answer from the Minister, he said.
De Silva further said that an Administrative officer is one highly respected and a higher official position in Sri Lanka and they should be given recognition.
President of the SLASA Prabath Chandrakeerthi said that they have been demanding for a special allowance for the past ten years.
In the meantime, De Silva added that they had no intention of causing inconvenience to the public and requested the public to refrain from visiting government institutions today.
He further said that they are expecting a favorable reply from the Minister.
Now the minimum salary given to a SLAS officer is Rs 51,405 and we are very well aware that other officers, including Police officers in lower ranks receive a better salary than ours, he said.
According to the SLASA Vice President Rs 35 Million is spent per month on allowances given to SLAS officers today and if the special allowances are also included, the government would have to spend another Rs 50 Million per month.
He said that currently there are nearly 2,462 SLAS officers in Sri Lanka and amongst them, 303 are heads of departments.
He said that heads of departments have to be given Rs 50,000 as special allowance and for others depending on their grades the allowance would differ.

Somerset go on top of county championship
LONDON, Tuesday: Somerset moved top of the County Championship as they chased a target of 248 on a tricky fourth-day pitch for a six-wicket win over Nottinghamshire.
Matt Renshaw followed his first-innings 106 with 61, before he and James Hildreth went in quick succession. But Tom Abell (46) and Steven Davies (44) then shared a crucial unbroken stand of 87 to see Somerset to 250-4.
Earlier, Notts were all out for 505 after following on, with the last two wickets adding 37 in the morning. However, their first-innings deficit of 258 after being skittled for just 134 proved to be decisive.
Australia opener Renshaw has now scored 472 runs in his five matches for Somerset, including three centuries, but his fifty at Taunton was arguably his most important innings on a turning surface.
Division Two leaders Warwickshire cruised to a fourth successive County Championship win as they beat Glamorgan by four wickets at Edgbaston.
Former Warwicks captain Ian Bell hit 115 not out, his second unbeaten hundred of the game, to steer the hosts to 294-6. Will Rhodes (61) and Jonathan Trott (67) shared solid stands with Bell.
Spinner Andrew Salter claimed a career-best 4-80, but Glamorgan pressure came too late as they suffered a third straight Championship defeat.
Prior to this game, Bell had gone 32 Championship matches dating back to April 2016 without reaching three figures.
But, having hit 106 not out in the first innings, he became the first Warwicks batsman to hit two hundreds in a match since his own previous effort against Lancashire at Old Trafford in 2004 - and this was the first time he had achieved the feat at Edgbaston.
Durham completed a remarkable 95-run victory over Derbyshire at Chester-le-Street, recovering from being skittled for just 96 on the opening day.
The home side, dismissed inside 44 overs and trailing by 109 after the first innings, set Derbyshire a target of 268 thanks to Gareth Hartes 114.
Already reduced to 69-4 on day three, the visitors lost Callum Brodrick and Daryn Smit in the space of seven balls. Chris Rushworth ended with figures of 5-47 as Derbyshire were 172 all out.
Matt Salisbury (4-69) also starred with the ball, while opener Ben Slater was the only batsman to offer any real resistance with 68 - the next best score Tony Palladinos unbeaten 29.
It was Durhams second County Championship victory of the season - and the second to come in dramatic circumstances, having beaten Leicestershire to win for the first time after following-on in their history in May.
Gloucestershires Graeme van Buuren and Kieran Noema-Barnett shared a second century partnership of the match to earn them a draw with Kent.
The hosts, following on, started the final day 73-0 - trailing by 269 runs - hoping to avoid an innings defeat. Kent were largely frustrated but had their opponents 219-6 - 50 runs behind - with the new ball in their hands.

Special Awards for Exporters who engage staff with disability
The National Chamber of Exporters (NCE) is pleased to announce that the 26th Annual Export Awards event will be held on September 28, 2018 at the Hotel Shangri-La, Colombo. It will provide a great opportunity for the Exporter community to compete on a single platform under Extra-large, Large, Medium and Small categories to showcase their achievements by winning Gold, Silver, and Bronze awards.
At the application launching ceremony held at the Hotel Galadari Colombo, Menaka Wanniarachchi Director Operations of the Chamber stated that The NCE Export Awards has been conducted continuously for the last 25 years without a break, and that the nation has witnessed an increased number of exporters participating this prestigious event.
She added that the NCE has introduced a Special Award for the first time, to recognize the importance and contribution to create an inclusive society through the inclusion of Persons with Disability, which is not only a national goal but a Sustainable Development goal recognized globally. Quoting a famous American politician Thomas Perez, She stated that Employers have recognized for some time that it is smart business to have a diverse workforce - one in which many views are represented, and everyones talents are valued. Disability is part of diversity.
Menaka stated that the NCE also adheres to the same perspective, along with the observation and careful understanding of the unemployment and underemployment trends prevailing among Persons with Disability, who are in the labour force, and as such the NCE has decided to introduce this new feature for the first time. Awards will be conferred to organizations which employ Persons with Disability, and who contribute towards the skills development and wellbeing of such persons.
According to the Director Operations, this special award will be awarded to encourage more export oriented companies to engage, and include disabled people in their respective organizations, whereby the chamber expects an increased number of applicants for future award events by many companies creating a benchmark for Sustainable Development of the disabled people in the country. This will not only add value to their triple bottom line, but will also contribute more towards the national economy.

Kerosene price
Special mechanism to be set up to prevent use by buses
As fishermen protest against the recent increase in kerosene prices, Co-Cabinet Spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratne said the earlier increase had resulted in a 50 percent reduction in kerosene sales in the country.
Most of this it is as a result of buses and other motor vehicles no longer purchasing kerosene to run their vehicles, said the Minister, addressing the Cabinet media briefing yesterday.
President Maithripala Sirisena had previously issued strict instructions to curb the menace of bus drivers mixing kerosene with petrol in their vehicles.
Thus along with kerosene being increased from Rs. 57 per litre to Rs. 101, the Petroleum Resources Ministry also undertook raids at petrol stations to apprehend those who illegally sold kerosene to be mixed with petrol.
With fishermen protests, the prices were dropped to Rs. 70 per litre as of Tuesday (12) night, but they have asked that prices be brought down further to Rs. 57 per litre.
If we keep decreasing the price, it will only encourage motor vehicle owners to resort to their previous practices. So the President also asked that a special mechanism be designed to deal with the menace of using kerosene for illegal purposes, said the Minister.

Spinning a yarn
The story of the saree is as complex as its pleats. The six yards of elegance rarely goes wrong, provided its draped and styled well. There are also endless reasons and occasions to wear it. The modern women are opening up to trying out different looks and drapes. Here is a look at some of the details related to the nine yards that turn heads.

Body type matters in choosing a saree 
Sarees are one of the best outfits for women. The best thing about the saree is that they are suitable for all occasions.
Whether you are travelling, heading to the office, at home or on the way to an occasion like a wedding, party, get together or any other event, the saree sets off a timeless beauty for any woman. The right saree can hide not only any flaws in your body but it can also increase your beauty in many ways and can make you look like a queen!

Popular saree draping styles in Sri Lanka 
Sri Lankan women wear sarees in many styles. However, two ways of draping the saree are popular and tend to dominate the culture: the Indian style and the Kandyan style (or osariya in Sinhalese). The Kandyan style is generally more popular in the hill country region of Kandy from which the style gets its name. Though local preferences play a role, most women decide on the style depending on personal preference or what is perceived to be most flattering for their figure.
The traditional Kandyan (osariya) style consists of a full blouse which covers the midriff completely, and is partially tucked in at the front. However, modern intermingling of styles has led to most wearers baring the midriff. The final tail of the saree is neatly pleated rather than free-flowing.
Kandyan saree materials 
The saree worn for a Kandyan wedding is often made of materials like silk and is richly decorated with embroidery. However an osariya worn more casually is usually of less expensive but more versatile fabric, such as cotton or linen. Batik print Kandyan sarees have also become quite popular.
Prints for body types and occasions 

Taller women can carry off heavy borders really well. You can also opt for big bold prints in a variety of colours, as it tends to divert the attention from your height. If you are short, avoid big prints and heavy borders. Short and slim women should opt for sarees with a thin border, as it will make you look tall. Small to medium-sized prints will look great on you as well.

Saree borders 
A border of a saree also plays an important role in the womans personality. Most of the designers advise short women to go for a saree with no border or shorter borders. If you are tall then you should wear sarees with broad borders.

Saree shades 
If you are short you should avoid big prints and heavy borders. Short and slim women should opt for sarees with a thin border, as it will make you look tall. Small to medium-sized prints will look great on you as well.
Fabrics for Sri Lankan women 
Georgette, chiffon and net fabrics will suit Sri Lankan women best. They will snugly wrap around your body, highlighting your curves.
You should opt for dark colours while buying a saree. Your saree should never be very heavy. It can have delicate embroidery and beadwork, but it should never be too stiff. It should have a good fall, which will make you look slimmer. You can also wear a blouse with criss-cross strings holding it together. It will definitely increase your oomph factor.
If you are slim, then you should pick up cotton, silk and organza sarees. They will give you a fuller figure. You can opt for sarees in lighter colours and heavy embroidery. Go for brocade or beadwork. Since you are slim, you can opt for big and bold prints in a variety of colours. Slim women can carry off backless, sleeveless, halter neck and tube blouses really well.
Picking accessories to match a saree 
Accessorise your saree intelligently. Clutches, shoes and statement necklaces can make or break your look. If your saree is too heavy, opt for pretty danglers and keep it simple.
Pointers to keep in mind while draping a saree
* The way you drape a saree around your body also decides how you will look.
* By draping a saree in some particular way you can look taller, short, slimmer, fatter or strange.
* A saree should be draped properly otherwise it looks untidy, clumsy, and can make a woman appear fat irrespective of what type of saree you are wearing.
* The pleats should be even and neatly tucked.

Saree facts
*Art Silk sarees look traditional plus fashionable
* Chiffon sarees are lightweight, balanced plain-woven, sheer and a comfortable fabric
* Silk can set off a typical ethnic appearance
*Cotton sarees are for all seasons
*Net sarees are more suited for evening functions
*Embroidery, sequins, stones work makes a saree blouse very attrac tive and gives a woman a rich look.
*A saree can be draped over 100 ways.
*A saree ranges from 3.5 yards to nine yards in length.

The Sri Lankan athletes who won fifth place for Sri Lanka with a medal bag of three gold, four silver and two bronze at the recently concluded Asian Junior Athletics Championship in Japan was given a warm welcome at the Bandaranaike International Airport special guests entrance by Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapa and officials of his Ministry on their arrival to the country.
The Sports Minister praised the medal winners as their achievements came from competing against 45 nations. "It is a great triumph that out of 13 participants, Sri Lanka has won nine medals. We have planned a long term program to train these athletes under top class coaches and bring them to Olympic level. We see a big difference in the outcome of the Commonwealth Games where 83 athletes took part and in this event where only 13 participated. We hope to select the best and provide all facilities to them in order to achieve international level targets," the Sports Minister said.

Sri Lanka gears up for seventh  edition of Red Bull Campus Cricket
The only global T20 cricket tournament for university students, the seventh edition of Red Bull Campus Cricket (RBCC) is soon to begin in Sri Lanka. This international cricket tournament provides the ideal opportunity for young cricketers to represent their university and thus gain an opportunity to further represent their country on an international level at the Red Bull Campus Cricket World Finals.
Red Bull recognized the importance of developing an international platform for campus cricket around the world.
RBCC aims at bridging the gap that exists for players from school to club teams, thus paving a clear pathway for talented players to reach national level. In the past RBCC has provided a platform where the world has witnessed the rise of now internationally acclaimed players, such as KL Rahul from India, Lungi Ngidi from South Africa, Chirag Suri from UAE, and Niroshan Dickwella from Sri Lanka.
Whilst connecting a generation of university students and building a lasting comradeship are at the very heart of RBCC, sports is the center of the entire tournament. As such, RBCC follows very strict cricketing guidelines that maintain the game at high professional standards in the cricketing world. For Sri Lanka, tournament director and renowned former national cricket player Brendon Kuruppu is busy with the duties of ensuring the tournament follows proper guidelines and is played in the right spirit. This year, RBCC has taken one step forward to encourage students to pursue their talent and passion in sports by bringing in veteran and 1996
World Cup winning former cricketing legend Roshan Mahanama as the events brand ambassador.
Over the past years, Sri Lanka has consistently proven to be a worthy contender at RBCC. After hosting the very first Asia Finals in 2012, the Sri Lankan team University of Moratuwa represented Sri Lanka at the first ever World Finals held at the R. Premadasa Cricket Stadium in 2013. In the years to follow, the National Finals were won by the International College of Business & Technology (ICBT) in 2014 and 2015, consequently representing Sri Lanka at the World Finals held at the Kia Oval in London and Dehradun, India respectively.
Hosted by Sri Lanka both in 2016 and 2017, the national finals were won by Business Management School (BMS) for two years in a row. While they emerged victorious and captured the coveted championship in 2016, the South African team won the world title in 2017.
This year, Sri Lanka is proud to host the Red Bull Campus Cricket Tournament for the fourth time. The World Finals will be played on home turf throughout the September, bringing this international stage to Sri Lanka once again. However, before gaining the opportunity to represent Sri Lanka, local teams must first conquer the national level. From Sri Lankas leading universities, 24 local teams will battle it out in front of hundreds of spectators from every university, in a tournament filled with fair amounts of fun and fierce competition. Commencing on June 19 at BRC and Colts Cricket grounds, the national tournament will bring together players and spectators from around the country amidst an atmosphere of feverish excitement.

Sri Lanka inks five new  MoUs with Finland
Representatives of the Sri Lankan and Finnish governments signed five new Memorandums of Understanding at a ceremony in Colombo on Tuesday.
The MoUs cover the sectors of vocational education, digitization, health, and energy.
(These) are really connecting the best of Finland with the best of Sri Lanka, said Finland Economic Affairs and Employment Deputy Minister Petri Peltonen, speaking at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel.
The memorandums were signed on the occasion of the Deputy Ministers second official visit to Sri Lanka within six months. Peltonen said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes trip to Finland last year was the driving force behind the increased collaboration between the two countries.
Its great to see that those directions by the prime ministers are now bearing fruit at all levels, he said.
Peltonen signed three MoUs with representatives of the Education Ministry, the Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Ministry, and the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry.
From this piece of paper, we now need to act, said Telecommunication Ministry Secretary Waduge Deshapriya. In addition to the government agreements, two companies from the 17-member delegation of Finnish businesses signed agreements with Sri Lankan counterparts on Tuesday.
Peltonen said that two other business-to-business agreements, on information technology and thermal power, were close to finalization.
Jonas Froberg, the South Asia Business Development Manager for the Finnish company Wartsila, said his company was talking to LTL Holdings about a project in Bangladesh. But he said they were also interested in investing in renewable energy projects in Sri Lanka. He said the island had huge but unrealized potential for solar, wind, and wave energy.
Investors should look to Sri Lanka not just for political reasons, but for economic ones also, he said.
I think we are truly making progress, said Deputy Minister Peltonen.

Surgical Slicing or Healthy Healing..!
It was sad seeing my huge German-Shepherd dog, whimpering in pain. His ear had got infected, so with cotton swab, antiseptic cream and warm water in plastic mug, I slowly and laboriously started cleaning it, holding his head lovingly against me, before putting soothing medication, and adding a few drops of a pain killer! My dog looked up at me, he usually allows me to touch his wounds, and I imagined what he was asking me with those brown pleading eyes, What are you doing master, what are you thinking off Just cleaning my ear Treating my wound, or what I touched his beautiful, handsome head and whispered, Im thinking of a healed ear! Did I see a smile on my dogs face as I gently caressed his huge head Whatever it was, he stopped whimpering and allowed me to minister to him, as I gently applied the anesthetic balm and he continued to rest his head happily on my shoulder.
As I looked up from him this morning I pondered on the imaginary conversation Id just had. I thought of doctors or surgeons looking down in the operating theatre at their patients. What did they see themselves doing Were they thinking of themselves, only cutting, slicing and surgically removing some infected part inside Were they so fixed on the task, theyd forgotten why they were fixing
Or the patient; did he or she as she was wheeled in, think fearfully of the surgery or happily of being fit and whole again What do you think of your morning workout As a tiresome exertion, or do you see a physically fit future you in the mirror
And as I pondered on such, and put aside my crude implements, Id used for my dog, I thought of leaders of nations, as they started doing dramatic and drastic things; did they see a nation in turmoil or a people happily living with each other in peace Does Modi in India see his policies of a Hindu country making all Indians happy
Kim in Korea, starving his people to pay for nuclear toys, the generals in Pakistan, and other world leaders; are they concentrating only on their bloody surgery and not on the healing
And then theres Trump; isolating America, not with a surgical scalpel but with butchers knife, as he, leader of the most powerful country on earth, with the power to bring peace to the whole world, instead, with furrowed head, bends over his repulsive, revolting, rotten tweets!
My dog, walked away from me, and in his eyes, I saw gratefulness for what Id done. He knew he was on his way to healing. Are we also sure of that as we look at all we and our leaders are doing Its time you and I raised our eyes and help raise theirs too, from surgical slicing and segmenting and separating, to simple, soothing healing..!

The companys mangers to the issue Ms. Business Intelligence, reported that they had received applications for 97,425,543 non voting shares, which was an equivalent to 9.7 times the shares offered for subscription and 59,461,579 of the voting shares offered for subscription.
With the conclusion of the rights issue, the company is looking forward to increasing its revenue and profits during the years to come.
The gross profit for the year ended March 31 2018 recorded Rs 41,8 million a 7 percent increase in spite of the revenue declining by 7 percent from Rs 333 million to Rs 310 million. Although the reinstatement of the GSP plus was in June 2017, the company was able to make use of this only in the last two quarters, where it was able to increase its purchases of raw materials from Sri Lanka due to the non availability of fish as a result of the two year ban imposed by the EU.
During the third and fourth quarters of 2017/18 the gross profit margin averaged at 17% while in the previous two quarters of the same year it was 10%.This is a direct result of the GSP plus being granted to Sri Lanka.
The company in envisaging that if this trend continues, it has the ability to increase revenue by a further 30% during the year.The rights issue proceeds will help the company to go for higher volumes of purchases from Sri Lanka to boost its exports and make use of the GSP concession for Sri Lanka Exports to the EU.

Trump catches  Pentagon off guard
US: Pentagon officials scrambled for a clear message on Tuesday about the US military presence in South Korea, after President Donald Trump vowed at his summit with the North's leader Kim Jong Un to cancel "provocative" joint drills.
Trump surprised observers when he told reporters after the unprecedented meeting in Singapore that continuing the exercises routinely held between the US and South Korean militaries would be "inappropriate" while the US works to flesh out a comprehensive deal with North Korea.
"We will be stopping the war games, which will save us a tremendous amount of money, unless and until we see the future negotiation is not going along like it should," Trump said.
"Plus, I think it's very provocative," he noted, adding that "at some point" he wanted to withdraw US troops from the South.
The pledge, absent from the joint statement Trump signed with Kim, appeared to come as news to both South Korea and the Pentagon.
US Forces Korea (USFK), which comprises about 28,500 troops permanently based in South Korea, received no immediate new guidance on upcoming joint training exercises, including so-called Ulchi Freedom Guardian scheduled for later this year.
"In coordination with our (South Korean) partners, we will continue with our current military posture until we receive updated guidance from the Department of Defense and/or Indo-Pacific Command," Colonel Chad Carroll, spokesman for USFK, said in a statement.
Meanwhile at the Pentagon, officials ducked in and out of meetings to discuss what would amount to an epic shift in how the US military has been postured in South Korea for decades.
The defining motto of troops there is that they are prepared to "fight tonight," and joint drills are seen as the most integral component of that readiness.
"The Department of Defence continues to work with the White House, the interagency, and our allies and partners on the way forward following the US/(North Korea)summit," Pentagon spokesman Chris Sherwood said.
"We will provide additional information as it becomes available."
Colonel Rob Manning, another spokesman, said: "We are going to be aligned with the president," while noting that the readiness of US forces would remain "paramout."
Trump's statements in Singapore also point to what appears to be a growing gap between him and Defence Secretary Jim Mattis.
Only hours before the summit, Mattis told Pentagon reporters that, as far as he knew, the issue of US troops in South Korea would not be part of any discussion in Singapore.
Mattis has also been a staunch defender of America's long-standing alliances and the security and economic superstructure it engineered after World War II.
But Trump refused to endorse a communique at the G7 summit over the weekend that said participants were "guided by our shared values of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights and our commitment to promote a rules-based international order."
Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said it was "troubling" that Trump had agreed to suspend joint drills without making any reference to North Korea dialing back its conventional military threat.
"The Singapore summit statement is essentially aspirational: no definitions of denuclearization, no timelines, no details as to verification," Haass said on Twitter.
"What is most troubling about all this is that the US gave up something tangible, namely, US-RoK military exercises, in exchange," he added, using the abbreviation for South Korea's official name.
Still, he credited the summit for starting a diplomatic process between North Korea and the United States. - AFP

Trump didnt prepare much  for his meeting with Kim.  Will that matter
Have Trump and his advisors done enough planning and preparation to be able to improvise wisely when it comes to North Korea A single head of state summit is not as complicated as the D-Day invasion, but as head of state visits go, this is a complex one. Both Trump and Kim are famously thin-skinned and highly sensitive to the kinds of slights, real or imagined, that can arise when summit choreography goes awry. Even if the pageantry comes off satisfactorily, the nitty-gritty work of discussing denuclearization is incredibly complicated, as a thoughtful report by Stanfords Center for International Security and Arms Control suggests  perhaps more complex than anything Trump has wrestled with before
How much will the success of U.S. President Donald Trumps summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un depend on the quality and depth of Trumps own preparations
Thats the question Trump invited when he bragged that he did not need much prep work in the run-up to the meeting.
If the North Korean summit goes as badly as the G-7 summit did, the critics are likely to pounce on Trumps braggadocio and blame the president for attempting to wing it during the most important diplomatic test of his administration. Conversely, if the summit goes as well as the president has confidently predicted, Trump and his defenders are likely to credit his unorthodox approach to preparation.
Either reaction would be understandable  but perhaps not entirely fair. For starters, the administration has not been winging it when it comes to North Korea. Shortly after Trumps inauguration, his national security team at the time embarked on a strategic review of the North Korea issue, the outcome of which was the decision to pursue a classic boat-rocking strategy  a variant of the one the Trump team has also pursued on the Iran nuclear issue. For the most part, the administration pursued that strategy for the past 18 months, and it has produced some diplomatic successes, notably a U.N. Security Council resolution last December imposing tougher sanctions on North Korea.
Original strategy
I am less confident that the presidents strategic communications efforts on North Korea  the alternating bombast and fawning praise for the Kim regime  have been part of the same well-considered strategy, and the best that can be said for them is that they have forced North Korea off its own well-worn script of invective.
It is almost a certainty that the June 12 summit itself, particularly the quick setup, the abandonment of preconditions, and the lack of pre-summit diplomatic exchanges, did not follow the script of the original strategy. Rather, this was classic Trumpian improvisation, and it was a gamble that he did not need to take at the time, because such a summit bought by U.S. concessions could have been arranged months from now, after the sanctions had taken more of a toll. But this improvisational moment only arose in the first place because of the prior strategic efforts.
Former U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower famously opined, Plans are worthless, but planning is everything. Eisenhowers most important military venture as supreme commander of Allied forces in Europe during World War II, the D-Day invasion of Normandy launched on June 6, 1944, illustrate this point vividly. This was the largest and most complex military operation ever conducted in human history. The invasions success depended on the careful execution of tens of thousands of small tasks, each dependent on the execution of other small tasks. Simply arranging for all of the naval craft arriving at the appointed beaches in time to launch the invasion involved synchronizing the timetables of thousands of ships, launched from different ports and capable of different sailing speeds. The Allies spent years devising, testing, debating, and refining the plans.
And yet, from the get-go, many crucial things failed to go according to plan. Eisenhower had to delay the invasion from the planned June 5 date because of weather. Much of the tactical air bombardment proved useless because of bad visibility and an understandable abundance of caution on the part of the air crew.
The airborne operations as executed bore little resemblance to the plans as drawn up. Some gliders landed where they were supposed to, but many did not. A significant fraction of the paratroopers landed so far from their target that they spent days wandering around before they could be an effective fighting force.
The American landings at Omaha Beach were initially a disaster. The British and Canadian landings at Sword, Juno, and Gold beaches went according to plan for the first couple hours, but did not achieve in several weeks the objectives set for the first few hours and days.
The plan produced by the labours of hundreds of thousands of man-hours barely survived a few minutes of contact with the enemy. That was the plan that Eisenhower deemed useless.
However, all the work that went into developing the plan was indispensable. What Eisenhower and his fellow generals learned as they developed the plan, and what the junior ranks learned as they rehearsed the plan, positioned them to make sufficiently wise improvisations and adjustments so as not to be paralyzed once they encountered the inevitable surprise, hiccup, or snafu.
D-Day invasion
Have Trump and his advisors done enough planning and preparation to be able to improvise wisely when it comes to North Korea A single head of state summit is not as complicated as the D-Day invasion, but as head of state visits go, this is a complex one. Both Trump and Kim are famously thin-skinned and highly sensitive to the kinds of slights, real or imagined, that can arise when summit choreography goes awry.
Even if the pageantry comes off satisfactorily, the nitty-gritty work of discussing denuclearization is incredibly complicated, as a thoughtful report by Stanfords Center for International Security and Arms Control suggests  perhaps more complex than anything Trump has wrestled with before. Achieving real denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a way that does not undermine vital U.S. national security interests throughout northeast Asia is not as daunting an assignment as defeating Hitlers Wehrmacht, but if the diplomacy fails and war breaks out, the butchers bill could eclipse that of any U.S. military operation since World War II.
Trump has said that he will know within the first minute whether the summit will be a success or a failure  in effect, he is saying that he will likely have to adjust his planned script within minutes of delivering his opening lines. The success of his adjustments will depend on the quality of his intuition, but even more on the quality of his preparation. Trump has been thinking about the North Korea nuclear problem for a long time, New York Times reporter Mark Landler wrote in an intriguing and perhaps hopeful piece over the weekend. We will soon discover how useful those years of thinking were.
On the eve of the D-Day invasion, Eisenhower penned a letter accepting blame for the failure of the invasion. It is a sign of his mastery of the plan that Eisenhower realized just how fraught the venture was  and it was a sign of his great leadership skills that he understood that someone would have to take the blame if the mission failed, so the larger war against Hitler could continue. He was prepared to offer up himself as dispensable to protect the viability of his commander in chief, President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
The letter was provisional and was never delivered because the invasion turned out to be a success. But one wonders if Trump and his team have reflected on that example and are similarly prepared to accept responsibility if the summit fails. Whether they need to may depend on how well they have prepared.

## Title: TURNING THE PUBLIC TRUSTEE AROUND

TURNING THE PUBLIC TRUSTEE AROUND
Though little known, the office of the Public Trustee, is one of the oldest and richest government departments in the country. Things over the years however, have not gone too well for a department which is supposed to win the Trust of the public. According to its 2016 Performance Report to Parliament, it had 1,067 active trusts, 140 active estates and contributed a little over Rs 14 million to the Treasury. From 2012-2014 however, it was contributing an average number of Rs 6 million to the Treasury, even though 35 active trusts and eight active estates were added to its portfolio during the same period.
A damning 2015 Auditor Generals report highlighted that the Department had failed to fulfil the objectives by 30 May 2016 of the owner of a property of Shrima Indrani De Soyza who had died on 14 April 2007, even after nine years of her demise.
Furthermore, the house and its properties belonging to the owner of the estate had been given to a female officer in August 2009 who had been employed in the department by that time, without an agreement or levying rentals.
When you are dealing with the dead, there is none to question whether you have done the right thing. But the current Public Trustee, Sanath Weeratne who completed a year in office at the end of May this year, is determined to turn things around. He hopes that with the right systems in place, the above issues will remain in the past and the dead will find peace in his Office.
The concept of the Public Trustee initially started in New Zealand, then spread to Australia and England. Later to Hong Kong, Sri Lanka and Singapore and certain US States. They started it because they could not find a private trustee in the colony they could trust to take care of their estates, he said.
As large amounts of cash and property had to be managed, from the start, the emphasis had been to appoint a Public Trustee who was an independent and non-political person who will act with transparency, especially financial transparency and accountability, he added.
Today, New Zealand with a population of under 5 million people has its Public Trustee office manage 35 regional offices (as of 2007) to serve their citizens, 450 employees and manages about 330,000 last wills. They also provide a free legal service to help citizens draw up their wills. Costs are recovered once the wills are executed after the demise of the person.
They manage about 350 massive dairy farms and on average they write 21,000 last wills every year. So these are good examples of how a Public Trustee office can service a country. We are not quite there yet.
The question is can we get there
Change in the offing
The Sri Lankan Public Trustee office operates from just one place; Thurban House donated by the late Sir D. B. Jayathilake in his own last will. Sir D. B. had insisted that the Office operate from his home as long as it functioned in the country. In this house, a cadre of 87 run 1,190 trusts (as of 2018).
In the last 12 months, Weeratne said he had worked hard to first and foremost install systems in place, We have very big portfolio of cash assets and a very big portfolio of properties. It is a huge task but the important thing is that we have to have systems in place, he said.
Change has come in both small and big ways. As a place that dealt with a lot of paper, none had thought to have fire extinguishers. So this was firstly installed. Further, an insurance policy was taken on for not only the land and building but also for all the last wills they stored.
In addition, he had hired an independent consultant with experience in the plantation sector to manage the estates,
Our plantations were suffering massive losses because no qualified superintendents were appointed to look after them. Now a consultant manages 500 acres of estate and the profits are showing. For me it is a joke if the Public Trustee can man plantations around the country from Colombo 7 on a remote basis.
To ensure that the system lasts, Weeratne has taken steps to design and implement an operating manual,
Any public department needs standard operating procedures, we did not have that. We manage 1,190 trusts and a cash portfolio of Rs 2 billion, if we have a manual, it wont matter who occupies this place, he/she will know how the organization runs, said Weeratne.
This, he believed will lead to more transparency. A must when dealing with someone elses property. With that objective, he has also taken steps to re-activate their website which had not been active for the last 10 years, In my view the Public Trustee should not think twice or stutter to publish all of the trusts that are under the Public Trustee department on an active website. We should have on display all the profit-loss accounts and the balance sheet of all those trust properties we manage. Because it is trust property, not private. We give it to Parliament and are being audited by the Auditor General but how many look at the Hansards The idea is to serve the people who are here or domiciled abroad. They should be able to log on to the website and see how we run, and say it looks very transparent and that we are managing well. It is only then they will build some confidence and they will think of writing last will and investing properties with the Public Trustee.
To upload all accounts online, the Public Trustee has also taken steps to update their accounting software, an MS DOS system which was introduced in 1995. By 1995, the DOS system which was introduced in the 1980s was fast disappearing and thus it is unclear why the Trustee at the time chose to go with this- today this system is obsolete.
Further, in the process of making things more transparent, Weeratne is also pushing for a work flow software system which would computerize all the current processes of the Department,
Being a department that handles 1,190 trusts with each trust on average having at least three objectives, we would be at least handling 3,500 objectives which need to be fulfilled over 12 months. Some are stretched over a year, or every six months, monthly, quarterly.
So, if you have a software system with a workflow which generates precedence; a person walks in and opens a trust (everything is built in), you type in variables and it takes care of things and sends an acknowledgement to the settler saying this has been done. So if you have a precedent based workflow chart, it improves efficiency and also gives transparency, he explained.
He added that the idea was to have all the information on a persons trust, that is his/her, starting balance, current balance, rate of interest, objectives, what the department has done on one page, That in itself is a forensic audit which we can attach to each of the 1,190 trusts and send to Auditor General. That is transparency and that is where we need to go.
It will also save the staff a lot of unnecessary paper work. When asked whether the Department had funding to implement the computerization process and whether funding was what held them back previously, Weeratne simply replied that none before him had asked for the allocations needed,
We asked for the allocation and the Treasury agreed. The Treasury does not have a sixth sense about these things. We had not asked for all these before. Rs 3 million for our accounting software was given.
One more important allocation Weeratne had requested for was the money to cover legal expenses of Department.
Borrowing from Peterto pay Paul
The Public Trustee Department technically manages these trusts and estates on behalf of the government. Thus it has very little or no savings of its own. As a government department, its staff salaries are covered by the Treasury. A problem however crops up when they have to litigate on behalf of one of their trust properties. Weeratne explained it as, If you open up a Trust or Fixed deposit, we charge from your deposit (4-8 percent), interest and capital charges. If your property generates income, we charge that for the Treasury. Say person A leaves behind a lot of property but no liquidity and person B leaves the same extent of property but also has a lot of liquidity. But Person As estate has litigation and the Public Trustee has to spend money to litigate. The Trustee has no money, so he dips into the money in Person Bs estate to litigate As estate.
This practice today has snowballed, resulting in many estates running into millions in debt.
To me this is nonsensical and against the principles of Trust Law. It is not fair even if you are to look at it in ethical terms. The person would not like us using his money to litigate for another.
He further explained that at times in the past, the Public Trustee had chosen not to take steps in relation to properties, where the Trustee is the executor, purely on the basis that the Department had no money.
This happens because we simply have not requested for that allocation from the Treasury, he added.
Weeratne having brought this to the attention of the Minister has had a favourable response towards granting this legal fee from the Treasury, We are in the process of requesting it in the next budgetary allocation.
Getting legal fees sorted not only covers the errors of the past but it will also provide for the future when the time comes for the Trustee to litigate on the 254 last wills which were asked to be opened after a lapse of 67 years.
The courts had recently ordered that these wills be opened and the Trustee attain whether the persons referred to in the wills are dead or alive,
Out of the 254, 160 declare the Public Trustee as the executor. So we will have 254 testimony cases to launch proceedings in. It is a huge task. We are looking at properties tucked away for the last 67 years, these lands have probably had 2-3 generations enjoying it illegally, so we also have land ejectment cases. This is a large volume of legal work to be done simultaneously.
Taking it out to the people
Having instituted all this change, Weeratne passionately believes that the concept of the Public Trustee has to be taken out to the people. The best way to do that would be to have branches around the country that is more accessible to the people. We should not be expecting someone from Jaffna or Matara to come all the way to Colombo 7 to submit his last will, he said.
He has suggested that they start small and start one branch office in the North and another in the South and develop from there.
Once we implement our system here, then it is a question of replicating it. If we have a proper website, the public can download the forms and submit many of the applications online. Even when asking for a charitable request. Anyone who has questions, can ask online without coming here.
When taking it out to the people, the Public Trustee is determined to emphasise that the Department is for all people in the country. In the last year, Weeratne was in office, he remarked that no non-Buddhist clergy has approached him for donations to religious institutions. The Office donates to public causes such as religious institutions, medical expenses of the poor and the education of children who cant afford it.
There is a huge misconception that the Public Trustee predominantly serves Buddhists. That is wrong. I am a Buddhist but I am the Trustee for all Sri Lankans.
This misconception he said may have risen during the time the Department was wrongly assigned to the Ministry of Buddhist Affairs. Today it is rightly under the Ministry of Justice.
This year for the first time ever in the history of the Department, we had blessings from the clergy of all four religions when we started work on 1 January, said Weeratne determined to create a more equal space for all in the Department.
Looking to the future
As the clean-up process within the Department takes place, Weeratne has also been asked to look at possible amendments to the acts which govern the Office of the Public Trustee.
The Trustee has put forward two recommendations; one is to limit the time in office for the Public Trustee to around 4-5 years and to continue with the transparent recruitment process they started last year.
The appointment should be advertised, gazetted, go through the usual processes and then approved by Cabinet, he explained, Otherwise you are not appointing a Public Trustee but a political trustee.
At present a Trustee can serve up to his retirement age and that at times could go up to 10-12 years, but Weeratne believes that this is too long, If we happen to get a Trustee who is not doing too well, this is a long time before we can get things back on track, he said.
The Ministry has also suggested that a governing board be appointed to monitor the Office, but this is a suggestion Weeratne is opposed to. Instead, he suggests that an advisory board consisting of the three public servants; the Auditor general himself, Solicitor General (no person less than a solicitor general) himself and a retired Supreme Court judge nominated by the incumbent Chief Justice.
He explained that no country had a governing board above the Trustee as that would restrict his/her powers, The Public Trustee has absolute, undisrupted discretion which he has to use. If you take Sir DBs last will, it refers to undisrupted, absolute discretion.
When executing a last will, it was important that one person made the decisions that were required without interference from outside parties. Further, he stated that governing bodies could be made up of people from all sectors who would have their own vested interests in running such properties.
The country has a problem if you cant find one honest man to be a Public Trustee, and if you cant find one person, can you find 3-4 honest people to make up a governing body, he asked.
Secondly it would also dilute the power and discretion and turn the Public Trustee to a Custodian Trustee, said Weeratne.
A puppet who would have to play to the tunes of politicos, bureaucrats and business people behind them.
He explained that with the proper systems in place, there would be enough transparency and accountability to not warrant another governing body above.
I dont want to go down in history as the Public Trustee who diluted the powers of the Office, he remarked.
The Office of the Public Trustee above all needs to be seen honest and transparent if it is to fulfil its mandate and inspire others to donate their life savings to its cause. Thus, in a low trust society such as ours, it has become paramount to Weeratne to protect not only the letter of the law but also its essence,
We have to ensure that these properties are not misused and are open to investors who will come like scavengers. For example, Sir D.B. Sir D.B. asked that his coconut estate remain as it is Some may ask why cant we use it for another purpose But we must read it in the context of his legacy, he fought hard to promote agriculture during his lifetime, he would not want anything else on it. It is in that context that last wills must be seen.
Can you turn things around
Despite the progress made, it is not easy turning government departments around. Weeratne however, believed that if the Departments of Pensions and Immigration and Emigration could do it, so could they.
Direction and commitment from the top is important in any place to change things, he noted.
Following by example has also worked for him. When he wanted to install CCTV cameras in all the workplaces to ensure that the staff worked, there was much opposition. They agreed when he installed a camera in his own office.
We also need to provide a proper work environment for the people. No one wants to come to work with leaking roofs, rat poo on tables, etc, he added.
Thereafter, once the systems are in place, he believed that things will definitely start to look fresh at the Department of Public Trustee, It is the little things that make a difference.

US, Mexico and Canada to host  2026 World Cup: FIFA vote
Moscow, Wednesday: The United States, Mexico and Canada won the right to host the 2026 World Cup after easily beating Morocco in a vote by FIFA member nations on Wednesday.
The North American bid received 134 of the 203 votes, while Morocco polled 65 in the ballot at a FIFA Congress held in Moscow on the eve of the 2018 World Cup.
Football's showpiece event will return to the North American continent for the first time since 1994 when the United States hosted the tournament.
Delegates had been faced with a clear choice -- the joint North American bid boasts modern, established stadiums and well-developed transport links underpinned by Mexican football fervour.
Morocco, on the other hand, promised a "European" World Cup in Africa, playing on the north African nation's proximity to Europe.
But compared to North America, Morocco's bid existed largely on paper -- many stadiums and roads would have had to have been built and critics questioned how it would have coped with the 2026 tournament, which will be expanded to 48 teams.
FIFA inspectors classified the north African nation's stadiums, accommodation and transport as "high risk", awarding it just 2.7 out of five in an evaluation report, with concerns raised over several critical aspects.
They warned "the amount of new infrastructure required for the Morocco 2026 bid to become reality cannot be overstated".
The report made the US-Canada-Mexico bid the clear favourite after rating it four out of five, and Morocco was not able to bridge the gap. AFP

VINTAGE FASCINATION




Its difficult to tag Akila Madhushanis designs. It certainly doesnt seem traditional. Its not state-of- the-art modern or sci-fi stuff either. Like every girl growing up in an environment inspired by colours and textiles 24-year-old Akila loved drawing, dressing up and dressing others as well!





Driven by her fascination with fashion she soon pursued a career as a fashion designer.
Designing her dream
I loved drawing from my tender years. Therefore I chose art as a subject during my school days. I would stitch new dresses for my dolls and dress them up in clothes which go with the latest designs. I always vied to dress them in different and unique styles. As time passed I began to look for different and unique styles of clothing for myself. This got me to design my own attire rather than depend on buying stuff from the stores. This stimulated me into getting into the designing sector, Akila reminisced the past of her designer dream.
She had given wings to her dreams by joining the Academy of Design (AOD) and followed her degree from 2014 to 2017.
I followed the maths stream for my G C E Advanced Levels. Then I got into engineering to please my parents. Since I was so passionate about designing, I followed a fashion designing degree too along with my engineering degree. Since I managed to get a first class honours in fashion and textile design from Northumbria University, United Kingdom, I decided to pursue my dream of becoming a fashion designer, she said.
She notes that she draws her inspiration from vintage garments because those forms of designs are not used much today.
I actually blend the past with the present to create unique designs which suit the contemporary fashion market. Casual wear is my forte, she quipped.
Elaborating on her design techniques the young designer says that she gives priority to textile designs as well as the details of the patterns in a garment.
My focus is on traditional Sri Lankan textiles and using their textures, patterns, and techniques to uplift local craftsmanship. I use mainly Dumbara handlooms on my designs. Dumbara is a traditional form of handloom textile weaving which is a living heritage in the Dumbara valley of Kandy. I study the common designs among them and come up with ideas to use techniques which can produce modernized and exclusive versions of Dumbara weaving patterns. I believe that I have invented quite a number of different designs for this purpose, she said also adding that she has experimented with batik and denim bleaching and incorporate that knowledge into her designs.
I believe that the essence of Sri Lankan culture and traditions need to be integrated into your designs for them to capture the global market, Akila opined adding that she had manipulated the shapes and forms from African tribal decor and the artistic style of Keith Haring for her DON.A.09 collection. She had been inspired by hidden geometric shapes on the bodies of insects to design the Polygons collection.
Noting the pros and cons linked with the industry she says that the fashion scene is quite a happening place.
It is very exciting since you get to work on a variety of different projects that can be poles apart. You dont have to worry about getting stuck in one place for hours or following a monotonous schedule. It is not a nine to five occupation. It demands a lot of travelling and exploring while perceiving things from a designers eye. A designers life is always linked with studying new materials and exploring their creativity rather than simply designing. There is always something new to be taken up so you are never bored on the job. Designing is like meditating because you need to have a have a clear mind to come up with a new design, Akila explained.
She says that she admires the work of a number of renowned international designers like Alexander Wang, Public School, Vetements and Lacoste because each designer has his or her own design approaches and skills. She notes that if she was given a chance to pick a celebrity to design an outfit for, she would choose British actress Cara Delevigne because she has a great personality and a naturally gifted carefree look. Her looks also go well with mixing casual and sportswear with dressier outfits.
Recalling the moment she saw her designs on the catwalk for the first time Akila says that it was a very enthusiastic as well relieving moment which is a result of three years of hard work and sleepless nights.
I still have a long way to go. The fashion scene is booming and Sri Lankan designs have shown a great promise in the global market. People are more open to new venues today and we can capture the international fashion scene by using products and designs linked to our heritage, she added.
Since the profession is also demanding a designer needs to work for long hours to meet a deadline to finalize a project.
At times you might feel restless because there is not enough time to finish your project. Designing something creative and unique takes time. Your customers have to be satisfied with your output, she said.
Speaking about the challenges of the industry Akila says that it is difficult for up and coming designers to find a platform to showcase their creations.
Akila Madhushani
It is a matter of having connections because who you know can get you to the forefront. Getting your work out there might not happen if you have not established the right connections, she stressed.
Akilas father, L D Karunathilake, is a businessman while her mother, D A Samantha, is a housewife. She is the only child in her family. A past pupil of Vishaka College, Colombo, Akila is currently employed fashion designer at FashionMarket.lk
She says that it is important to be passionate about what you design, be goal oriented, think out of the box and try out new things to excel in the field.
I think it is important to have faith in your talents and dreams. Its not easy but if you follow your dreams without giving up on them, you will be able to achieve them. Everyone thinks that designing is easy but nobody thinks about it deeply. Only a designer understands how hard it is to design something with a concept and come up with new ideas, she noted with a smile.

2nd Test starts at St Lucias today
West Indies eye rare series win  as Lanka flatter to deceive
GROS ISLET, Wednesday: With a 1-0 lead in the three-match series, the Darren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in St Lucia could witness something momentous when West Indies take on Sri Lanka in the second Test here starting on Thursday. And it's not just Sri Lanka reuniting with the venue they famously flagged off fifteen years ago; it's as much about the hosts having a sniff at a series win, something so rare that it's trumped only by the compliments for a perpetually rebuilding Windies side.
2012 was the last they won a home series against a team other than Zimbabwe and Bangladesh -- both of whom were overwhelming also-ran, and not without a reason. It's about time for an encore for the Windies, and with an evolving batting order (read: Shane Dowrich) and upgraded confidence (read: Kieran Powell), they look ready to do it against better sides.
Which brings us to Sri Lanka, who deserve a thorough interrogation. Long gone are the days when you could hit the Caribbean shores and be allowed to suffer a misfortune, returning with scars -- not necessarily metaphorical -- telling the tale of a lesser player than you assumed yourself to be. You don't come here now and lose. Not anymore. You aren't playing the great West Indies, which is what makes Sri Lanka's loss to the Windies modernistically ordinary.
Kusal Mendis broke through with a stunning second-innings hundred while Lahiru Kumara impressed with his hostile seven wickets in the game, both the players recompensing for the team even in a loss. Those positives aside, what could knock them sideways is the absence of Angelo Mathews, who has returned home for personal reasons. Dinesh Chandimal, in light of this, will need to take up a more mature role that demands immediate binning of that half-cocked slog he played in the second innings.
WEST INDIES (Probable XI): Devon Smith, Kraigg Brathwaite, Kieran Powell, Shai Hope, Roston Chase, Shane Dowrich (wk), Jason Holder (capt), Devendra Bishoo, Kemar Roach, Miguel Cummins, Shannon Gabriel

SRI LANKA (Probable XI): Kusal Perera/Mahela Udawatte, Kusal Mendis, Dinesh Chandimal (capt), Dhananjaya de Silva, Roshen Silva, Niroshan Dickwella (wk), Dilruwan Perera, Rangana Herath, Suranga Lakmal, Lahiru Kumara, Asitha Fernando.

The world  according to  planet Rugby!
As the world rotates on its axis and the spotlight pendulum swings gloriously oblivious of how much we appreciate this game ...all things rugby dominate the globe Sri paradise awoke to nerves and much speculation about the outcome of the Royal v Peters clash to decide the Singer League Championship.
All the experts both near and far opting to park it on the fence, given the defending champions unbeaten stat and Peters hard fought loss to Joes.
As it turned out ...it was an unforgiving episode in the middle for coach Martis and his bruised Bamba brigade, looking to manufacture that elusive title yet again.
On the day, it was very much the Lewke coalition at Royal College that stayed patient and brushed aside all that Peters threw at them.
It was certainly not the hype and rhetoric bandwagon...or was it a Peterite dictate that exhausted the allocated oxygen for the 70 minutes in the middle.
Royal were sharp, consistent, predictable, efficient, remarkably patient with their team specialists...both in attack and especially their defending the goal line.
Good teams dominate play and are a constant threat, irrespective of what is current, in the middle.
Peters eventually running out of patience and petrol...gave up their league quest, minus the aggressive running, that kept their Bamba hopes alive ...even after their loss to concrete wall Joseph's.
Mighty was the Royal work rate that piled the points in the second half and outplayed St Peter's 3 to 1.
Royal marching victorious and such a grand team effort from the entire squad. Big hand to all their faithful for a job very well done.
Thank goodness we managed to finish the Singer League championship and deliver the season in style.
Much needs to be sorted and a professional eye to keep the spirit and upgrade the quality for all to enjoy.
The Milo knockouts should be equally lung busting, despite Royal staying away and consequently zero possibilities of anyone beating them.
Well done to Science and Maliyadeva for their step up...next season and enjoy the knockouts this June.
Planet rugby was rotating around the world series whistle stop in Paris for the 7s ...hardly the romantic conclusion sought by our untouchable Fiji islanders
Instead it was England, New Zealand and South Africa that showed spectacular skills and scintillating pace to break French hearts.
Bet the boys enjoyed the 7s and few loaded Parisian traditions thats hard to dismiss...plus some new skills for the trip home
But all is not lost for France as their U20 warriors push defending world champions New Zealand out and March into the final v England this Sunday.
The final will raise history and the rivalry that predates so much between England and France.
Whatever the rhetoric...this French side are tough as nails and at home in another World Cup final. Rest assured the entire French nation will be cheering the boys home and not the faintest hint of coming 2nd.
Locally it's the club 7s on Saturday and Sunday...but minus Kandy, who won the opening leg and are joined by Havelocks as well.....hardly the competitive edge we seek to identify true 7s talent and step them up to the Asian and world standard.
I am hopeful Sri Lanka Rugby will set up our Asian pathway for 7s and be relentless in their criterion for selection.
It is the toughest place on earth to step up and be counted as true 7s islanders...it's a reputation we must earn back by deeds and clinical skills, rather than special invites and colourful rhetoric.
It's no figment that Sri islanders were certainly considered by the elite for skills and courage...a reputation built on years of playing the toughest teams on the circuit.
It was our generation that carved that path and jealously guarded its achievementsand certainly deserve their gladiator tags. Proud islander 7s ...respect gentleman.
Grab the schedules for the impressive lineup of super summer internationals for the most grueling June ever.
Saturday 16
Japan v Italy at Kobe 10.30am, NZ v France at Wellington 1.05pm, Australia v Ireland at Melbourne 3.30pm, South Africa v England at Blomfontein 8.35pm.
Sunday 17
Argentina v Wales at Santa fe 1.10am, USA v Scotland at Houston 8.30pm.
All local Sri time on Setanta.
Blessing islanders. Enjoy, celebrate marvel at the skills and soak it all in.
Life on planet rugby is justifiably and quintessentially as close to that special turf as possible and not beyond our horizons.
Cheers for more!

World leaders approve of Trump-Kim Agreement
US: Major leaders across Asia and the world mostly voiced approval for Tuesdays agreement between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to push toward ending Pyongyangs nuclear weapons program, even as South Korea and others adopted a more cautious stance.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he told Trump in a phone call that the Singapore summit pact laid down a big framework for peace on the Korean peninsula and across the globe.
But Seouls presidential office said it was still trying to understand Trumps decision to end joint US-South Korean military exercises, long an irritant to North Korea.
Trump announced at a news conference he was terminating the war games and said it would save us a tremendous amount of money. But the Seoul-Washington drills were not mentioned in the document that Trump and Kim signed.
The next set of exercises were set for August, but Seouls Defence Ministry said, At this current point, there is a need to discern the exact meaning and intent of President Trumps comments, adding that there had been no discussions with Washington about the war games. Trump labeled them as inappropriate as North Korea moves toward denuclearization.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, The United States and North Korea have been in a state of antagonism for more than half a century. Today, that the two countries highest leaders can sit together and have equal talks has important and positive meaning, and is creating a new history.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe welcomed Kims approval of a commitment to complete denuclearization. The Japanese leader thanked Trump for raising the issue of North Koreas abduction of Japanese nationals with Kim and said that Japan will deal firmly with North Korea face-to-face on the issue.
Russias Foreign Ministry said the normalization of American-North Korean relations... is an integral part of resolving the problems of the Korean peninsula, including the nuclear one. - VOA

Yashoda Range Bandara who is the son of State Minister Palitha Range Bandara is warded at the Sri Jayawardenepura hospital and receiving treatment under guard by prison officers. Since Prison officials failed to produce him in the Chilaw Magistrate's Court yesterday, the Case was postponed till June 14 by the Magistrate who ordered Prison officers to produce him in Court on June 14.
The accident occurred when a double cab driven by Yashoda Range Bandara ran off the road at Kottapitiya Junction Bangadeniya on the Chilaw  Puttalam road and crashed into a house causing heavy damage to the cab and the house. The accident occurred when a group of people were returning in the cab after attending a party in a hotel in Karukepane on June 6.

State Minister Palitha Range Bandara when contacted said his son Yashoda Range Bandara was the Media Secretary to his Ministry and he had the right to drive the double cab belonging to his Ministry. The group had visited the hotel that day to attend an official meeting. Palitha Range Bandara said certain sections of the media were trying to blow the incident out of proportion in order to hide their own sins and omissions.
Palitha Range Bandara was in the Court Complex to attend another case heard in the Chilaw High Court. He was not in the Magistrate's Court when his son's case came up for hearing.
