The gravy was ladled only to Htota in the past: Champika
A sum of Rs 1.5 million has been spent per individual in the Hambantota district during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime whereas the allocation per head in the rest of the country was only Rs 75,000 during the corresponding period, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.
He said that the capital expenditure spent on Hambantota during 2005 to 2014 was Rs 900 billion. But there is only a population of 1.5 million in the Hambantota district, Minister Ranawaka said.
He made these observations to the media after cutting the first sod to construct a building for the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation in Kerawalapitiya. The country has to take a loan of Rs 1800 billion next year and 40 percent out of this will go towards settling the loans taken for construction of the Expressways during the Rajapaksa regime.
He said that the popular slogan by rural youth then was Kolambata Kiri, Apita Kekiri which meant that all the privileges went Colombo but rural areas received a raw deal. But during the Rajapaksa regime there hadnt been even Kekiri (Cucumis Melo) to Colombo, said Minister Ranawaka. However this government too is working too much for the people in Hambantota.
The Minister also said that benefits of the money allocated for the Expressways and for Hambantota during the previous regime would not accrue to us after 10 years. Had the same money utilized to the development of Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara districts the entire country could have benefitted.
He further said the Ministrys attempt was to set up the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation in Kerawalapitiya shifting the buildings from Kirimandala Mawatha.
Cabinet approval has been granted to construct a Green City there, said Minister Ranawaka.
Cabinet approval has also been granted even to construct a housing complex, develop schools and roads there within three years.
He also said that steps will be taken to develop Kerawalapitiya which once was a backyard for garbage dumping.
He added that it would be developed to provide services to the Colombo Port City, airport etc.
When the Outer Circular Road opens in 2018, a new era will dawn to Kerawalapitiya, Minister Ranawaka said.
Land Reclamation and Development Corporation Chairman Asela Iddawela, its Acting Director Roshan Gunawardena and its General Manager Srimathi Senadeera were also present at the occasion.

High food taxes driving cost of living - Advocata Institute
The Advocata Institute is launching a project to monitor import tariffs on food, with weekly updated figures available on the institutes website as a Food Tax Tracker.
Sri Lanka has high food costs. Consumer prices are 25.22% higher (and grocery prices 34.48% higher) than in India according to data gathered for August 2017 by Numbeo, a crowd-sourced database. One reason for high food prices is the high import taxes on food items. The government intervenes heavily in the trade regime for food items through para-tariffs such as a CESS and Special Commodity levy.
The public is unaware of the extent to which food is taxed, so we have compiled a table showing the tax on basic food stuffs, items that would be on table of many families. Import taxes add Rs.130 to a bottle of cooking oil, Rs.880 to a kg of butter, Rs.625 to a kilo of yogurt and around 141% to a kilo of cheese.
Gathering accurate data on food taxes is a slow and painful process due to frequent changes in the tax structure.
The initial exercise is limited to a few basic food items but Advocata hopes to expand this scope to eventually include all major food items.According to available data only 4.3% of government revenue is raised through the special commodity levy imposed on food items, which ironically is almost exactly equivalent to the losses incurred by the major state enterprises.
Given that Sri Lankans as a whole are food consumers rather than producers and Advocata urges the government to remove para tariffs such as the Special Commodity Levy and CESS and return to a regime of low and uniform duties for all items including food.

Kantar unveils Sri Lankas Top 10 FMCG  brands based on LMRB household panel
The latest Brand Footprint Study by Kantar World panel is now launched, recognizing the Top 10 FMCG Brands on the basis of 12 month performance based on Kantar LMRB Household Panel, the iconic study which monitors consumer purchase behavior of FMCG brands brought into the home.
The Global Brand Footprint Study analysed one billion households across 43 countries in five continents involving over 300 billion shopper decisions, among 15,300 brands across 200 FMCG categories covering 73% of the global population.
Sri Lanka is in the study for the second time, covering over 5 million households island-wide, with 400 brands and 1.4 billion shopper decisions stated Himalee Madurasinghe, Chief Executive, Kantar LMRB. According to the global report, even in uncertain and challenging times,strong brands growth remains rooted as they continue to be chosen more times, by more buyers. They use intrinsic consumer understanding to continue to be relevant to the consumer. This could be a good measurement to assess the success of a Brand among its consumers, and is an independent view based on consumer behavior. To the marketer this would reflect on the effectiveness of its activity done to sustain the Brand, Himalee added.
Global report reveals, despite the market challenges the fundamentals for brand growth remain constant. The fact that brands are finding ways to grow in difficult circumstances display there is always headroom for growth. Brands whilst being true to its loyal base need to concentrate on reaching new customers  their non-shoppers  in order to flourish. The prize for finding these new customers is considerable; just a 1% point increase in global penetration will win a brand 11 million additional purchasing households.
The study used its proprietary metric  Consumer Reach Points (CRPs)  to discover how many times a brand was chosen by consumers over the course of one year. CRP is measured by looking at how many households are buying a brand (penetration of a brand) and how often they are buying it (frequency of purchase)  this displays the amount of closeness that consumers have with the brand and provides a true representation of shopper choice.
Chamika Fernando, Head of Kantar LMRB Household Panel explained that every household buys a repertoire of brands, which means that at each and every occasion there is chance that the household might purchase any brand.

Misappropriating public funds : Former President hiding behind press releases - UNP
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should have accepted in court to having given the order to distribute Sil cloth during the previous Presidential election campaign and not by issuing a press release, MP Nalin Bandara said.
Bandara addressing the media yesterday at the Information Department said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had issued a press release accepting responsibility over distribution of sil cloth and also trying to justify the use of public funds.
He said that the former President should have done it before his Secretary Lalith Weeratunga, and former Telecom Regulatory Commission Chairman Anusha Pelpita, were found guilty.
The former President could have easily saved those public servants but he never did. He never appeared for any related cases in courts. But he had issued a press release that he is responsible for it, he said.
MP Bandara said some Buddhist monks are trying to protect the former President by saying that Weerathunga and Pelpita were arrested for distributing Sil cloth.
Some politicians are using Buddhism to cover up their fraud and corruption. I request the Maha Sangha to make a decision to control such incidents, he said.
MP S.M. Marikkar said Weerathunga and Pelpita were not arrested for distributing Sil cloth but for misappropriating public funds and for violating election laws.
Provincial council elections are coming therefore the former President is trying to create a picture among public that they were arrested for distributing sil cloth. he said.

Singapore Airlines GM sees huge growth potential for Colombo services
There is a steady growth in the Colombo-Singapore sector and Colombo as a destination has shown tremendous potential to both Singapore Airlines and Silk Air, said Singapore Airlines Sri Lanka General Manager Hu Hong Yao.
Speaking to Daily NewsBIZ Aviation, he said that this is the main reason for the airline to introduce their sister airline, Silk Air, to Sri Lanka from this year.
Currently Silk Air flies thrice to Colombo and soon this frequency would be increased gradually to make it a daily.
In addition, Singapore Airlines operates daily flights and if Colombo maintains its growth trajectory, additional flights may be considered. Similar to the increase in passenger demand, there is also steady growth in the cargo sector as well, he said.
He however said that they would rule out operating Airbus A380 aircraft to Colombo and also operating stopover flights to Mattala airport.
He said that Changi Aarport has two peak schedules, both in themorning and at night and the Silk Air flight was introduced mainly to offer quicker connections to meet this peak.
He said that both Singapore and Sri Lanka offer visas on arrival for and this is a major plus point to increase their passenger loads.
Since Indonesia too offers visas on arrival for Sri Lanka travellers, Singapore is a preferred transit point for Sri Lankans to fly to several points in Jakarta.
Commenting on the Colombo airport he said that he feels that more retails stores with global brand names should come up. The country needs to offer better shopping facilities at the Colombo airport.
He said in contrast, the shopping experience at the Changi airport in Singapore is huge and this gives several options for the transit passenger. He also said that passengers flying beyond Singapore with over four hour transit are offered free city tours, Changi airport $20 dollar value vouchers, lounge facilities and many more.
The GM said that one of the other unique features of flying with both Singapore Airlines and Silk Air is that the passenger has the option to use either airline for their travel on one single ticket, according to their preferred flight departure time.
He said the GSA, Aitken Spence too, along with the staff in Colombo, is one of the airline's great assets and they are like a family to them.

Sitar used by George Harrison to be auctioned in the United States

A sitar owned and played by George Harrison is going to be auctioned in the United States.
The instrument, purchased from a shop on London's Oxford Street in 1965, was used by Harrison during the recording of the Beatles song Norwegian Wood.
The Indian string instrument, crafted by a well-known music shop in Kolkata, was later gifted to a friend of Harrison's first wife, Patti Boyd.
Bidding for the sitar will begin on 28 September at $50,000 (37,327).
Harrison had discovered the sitar in 1965, on the set of the Beatles' second film, Help.
His love affair with oriental mysticism first made itself known in Norwegian Wood, John Lennon's tale of an extra-marital fling. Acoustic guitar and muted bass were augmented by the Indian instrument.
"We'd recorded the Norwegian Wood backing track and it needed something. We would usually start looking through the cupboard to see if we could come up with something, a new sound, and I picked the sitar up - it was just lying around; I hadn't really figured out what to do with it," Harrison was quoted as saying in The Beatles Anthologies.
"It was quite spontaneous: I found the notes that played the lick. It fitted and it worked."
Next year, Harrison gifted the sitar to George Drummond, a friend of Boyd, during the couple's honeymoon in Barbados.
The Beatles recorded Norwegian Wood - the first Western rock band to use the sitar on a commercial recording - in October 1965, heralding a short lived "raga-rock" genre.
A year later, Harrison travelled to India to learn how to play the instrument under the renowned sitar maestro Ravi Shankar.
In an interview with the BBC's Mark Tully in April 2000, Shankar said when he first heard Harrison playing the sitar in Norwegian Wood, he was not impressed.
"I couldn't believe it," he said, "it sounded so strange. Just imagine some Indian villager trying to play the violin when you know what it should sound like."
Harrison later agreed, saying the sitar on Norwegian Wood was "very rudimentary".
"I didn't know how to tune it properly, and it was a very cheap sitar to begin with. But that was the environment in the band, everybody was very open to bringing in new ideas."

Students are provided with a detailed understanding on the marketing tools. The strategic level focuses on concepts such as Sustainability and Strategic Marketing Planning. The final level of PGDIM is an individual research study every student is required to carry out.

Sri Lanka honoured  at UNWTO
Sri Lankas rise as a global tourism destination was recognized at the 22nd Annual General Assembly of the United Nations World Tourism Organization.
The bi-annual meeting is currently taking place in Chengdu, China from September 11-16. It will discuss how to advance the contribution of tourism to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and define the actions of the Organization for the period 2018-2019.
Sri Lanka is being represented at this meeting by the Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga who was bestowed with the honour of being elected as a vice chair of the UNWTO General Assembly by the Committee on South Asia.
This appointment shows the recognition that Sri Lanka has gained as an upcoming tourism destination. It will help me to portray Sri Lanka and its unique attractions to the leaders of world tourism.
It is indeed an honour and I will leverage this appointment to put Sri Lanka in the world tourism spotlight, said Minister Amaratunga.
Sri Lanka Tourism has fought multiple battles throughout this year starting from the airport closure for four months, to the devastating floods in the south to the garbage crisis followed by the dengue issue, all of which have been negatively highlighted by the international media.
These unfortunate events which were beyond our control have obviously had a negative impact on arrivals this year and it is only now that there is a conducive environment for inbound tourism. Despite all this it is indeed reassuring that arrivals are beginning to pick up once again and we are very confident of achieving our targets for this year, noted Minister Amaratunga, adding I hope there will not be any other disruptions in the next four months.
Meanwhile Secretary-General, World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) Dr. Taleb Rifai, described the 22nd UNWTO General Assembly as a  unique opportunity to get the sector united towards the common goal of making tourism a true driver of sustainable development.

Third Space Global employs online tutors from SL for UK students
Third Space Global, a UK owned BOI approved company, opened its new regional headquarters at Orion City, Colombo 9, on September 13.
The company has grown to over 200 staff since it began operations in September 2015.
The new facility marks a milestone for the CEO and British-born Sri Lankan Roshan Nilaweera, who has ambitious plans to create 1,000s of jobs for young Sri Lankans to engage in the global digital economy.
For the opening, Nilaweera was joined by Tom Hooper, the Founder and CEO of Third Space Learning, the London based parent company.
Third Space Learning is building the worlds first global and scalable teaching network of highly trained online tutors supported by cutting edge technology.
Third Space Learning offers the largest network of one-on-one Math tuition in the UK.
In the last four years, the company has worked with 16,000 children across 600 schools, delivering 200,000+ teaching hours.
It achieves this by recruiting young and intelligent Sri Lankans. Before they begin, they undergo an intensive training programme on the newest teaching techniques and how to use our Third Space technology to deliver results for children we work with.
Third Space Global employs over 200 early 20 year olds - for most this is their first job. Many had never considered a teaching career, but Third Space Global is not your typical education IT company.
Staff receive excellent training, designed by the resident international staff, and enjoy early promotion opportunities due to the rapid expansion.
The new office provides an excellent training, working and recreational facilities which contribute to building a happy working environment and culture.
Before joining Third Space, Nilaweera was a Math and ICT teacher who studied a MEng in Computer Science. He spent most of his life living and working in the UK but chose to immigrate to Sri Lanka to set up the main regional office of Third Space Global in order to create employment and training opportunities for young Sri Lankans whilst helping to contribute to Sri Lankas economic development.
Nilaweera believes there are many other non-resident Sri Lankans like him, who under the right conditions, would also love to return to Sri Lanka to help create jobs and contribute to economic development.
Whilst Third Space is a purely export company, it is also keen to support education in Sri Lanka through its innovative CSR programmes. For the past six weeks, Third Space has been running a free eLearing Hub programme from their office and has welcomed 800 visits by 8-16 year olds.
Unlike a school or a tuition centre, young learners receive a quick orientation and then set about managing their own learning schedules as they work with free online eLearning programmes.
TSG staff are on hand to provide a helping hand but always ensure that learners develop autonomy and independent thinking and problem solving skills.
Third Space Global plans to provide a free toolkit so this eLearning programme model can be replicated by other companies opening their offices to learners nationwide.
The company also plans to launch free teaching and learning workshops next summer to support teacher training across the nation.
They are already in discussion with potential partners but welcome others interested in partnering with them on this venture.
Third Space Learning is projected to grow 200% over the next 24 months as it expands to new markets and geographies.
This will result in Third Space Global creating another 250 jobs and opening new offices across Sri Lanka. Nilaweera believes Third Space Global is an exciting statement of the innovation and development that Sri Lanka is capable of.

Those born after 1995 are less interested in dating because of their interactions online
Loves young dream is dying out, according to new research.
People born after 1995 are much less interested in dating than the generation before them, a new book has revealed.
The first generation to spend their whole adolescence in the presence of smart phones, known as iGen, is replacing social interaction with social media.
The research was carried out by Professor Jean Twenge, from San Diego State University.
She found that the effect of this is phenomenon is that the dating scene is dwindling.
More than half (56 per cent) of 14 to 18-year-olds went out on dates in 2015 but in comparison, for Generation X and Baby Boomers, it was around 85 per cent.
The findings are presented in a new book, entitled iGen: Why Todays Super-Connected Kids Are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happyand Completely Unprepared for Adulthoodand What That Means for the Rest of Us.
The book brings together surveys of 11 million young people as well as in-depth interviews.
Teens are spending an enormous amount of time, primarily on their smart phones and communicating with their friends electronically, Twenge told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.
What thats meant is they are spending less time interacting with their friends in person, hanging out with their friends.
Another effect is that sexual activity is declining too. Since 1991, sexual activity in 14 and 15-year-olds has dropped by almost 40 per cent.
The average teenager has sex for the first time at 17 now, which is a year later than Generation X.
Sociology experts class those born in or before 1945 as the Silent Generation. People born between 1946 and 1964 are known as Baby Boomers.
Those born between 1965 and 1980 are Generation X. Anyone born between 1980 and 2000 are labelled Millennials.
A study published last year said that iGen, also known as Generation Z, are the most conservative since the Second World War.
The youngsters surveyed had more conservative views on gay marriage, transgender rights and drugs than Baby Boomers, Generation X or Millennials.
The questioned were more prudent than Millennials, Generation X and Baby Boomers but not quite as cash-savvy as those born in 1945 or before.
When asked to comment on same-sex marriage, transgender rights and cannabis legislation, 59 per cent of Generation X teenagers said they had conservative views.

Trump,  Democrats agree on DACA
US: Top US congressional Democrats emerged from a meeting with President Donald Trump Wednesday claiming progress on a deal that protects young immigrants and boosts border security, while not including a border wall.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi said they had a very productive dinner meeting with Trump in which the discussion focused on the fate of young immigrants who arrived in the country illegally as children.
Trumps predecessor Barack Obama protected such immigrants, known as dreamers, through his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals order. But Trump rescinded that executive order, and urged Congress to craft a legal solution within the next six months.
We agreed to enshrine the protections of DACA into law quickly, and to work out a package of border security, excluding the wall, thats acceptable to both sides, Schumer and Pelosi said in a joint statement.
The White House, which had earlier put out a muted statement about the constructive working dinner addressing tax reform, border security, DACA and the need for bipartisan solutions, quickly pushed back against the Democrats characterization.
While DACA and border security were both discussed, excluding the wall was certainly not agreed to, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on Twitter.
A Schumer aide also weighed in to clarify.
The president made clear he would continue pushing the wall, just not as part of this agreement, Matt House tweeted.
Trump has maintained his desire to build a wall, even threatening a government shutdown last month if he did not get his way. Funding for its construction would likely be pursued through budget talks and not DACA legislation.
But the progress that was apparently achieved at the dinner is another sign that the Republican president is comfortable dealing with the opposition, as much or more than the congressional leaders within his own party. Last week, over the objection of House Speaker Paul Ryan, Trump struck a deal with Schumer and Pelosi to fund a hurricane relief package that also included a debt ceiling hike and three-month extension of government funding.

UK Medical Council says SAITM  qualification unacceptable
Rejects SAITM doctors PLAB test application
The United Kingdoms General Medical Council (GMC) has rejected an application submitted by a South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) graduate to take the doctors PLAB test, the Daily News learns.
To practise medicine in the UK, the doctors qualified overseas must pass the PLAB test to demonstrate their medical expertise and practise medicine in the UK.
The GMC having rejected the students application has reportedly informed higher-ups of the college that Malabe Private Medical School (awarded by the South Asian Institute of Technology, Sri Lanka) does not meet their acceptability criteria.
the GMC has clearly placed the Sri Lanka Malabe Private Medical College in their website under its list of Overseas Medical qualification not accepted by the GMC.
Asked about the situation, SAITM Registrar Husni Hussain said: the GMC has rejected an application submitted by one of our students to sit the PLAB exam, but they have done so on the basis that the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) has not recognised our institute (SAITM).
She pointed out that SAITM is a degree awarding institute recognised by the Higher Education Ministry and it is empowered to grant MBBS degrees.
She said SLMC cannot recognise SAITM because it is a private medical institute, SLMC can only recognise qualification of overseas medical institutes. Dr. Samantha Ananda of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said they have seen reports stating that GMC has put SAITM in their official unacceptable list.
SAITM perhaps made its way into the unacceptable list of the GMC for acceptable reasons, Dr Ananda said. An expert committee of learned professors from the SLMC had observed that Malabe Medical College is in depravity in terms of meeting necessary requirements and facilities to produce safe doctors, he said.
The statement of the GMC read: A decision to place a medical school on this list is not taken lightly. We only do so following a full investigation and where we conclude that it is the most appropriate course of action in light of our main objective to protect, promote and maintain the health and safety of the public.Dr Ananda said the GMOA stands firmly with the decision of the SLMC regarding their stance taken on the SAITM ansd the assessment of the GMC. Meanwhile, SAITM Parents Association Assistant Secretary Gamini Jayasinghe said they are concerned about the matter.
SAITM issue likely to be settled; ASG informs SC
Lakmal Sooriyagoda

The Supreme Court was yesterday informed there was possibility of a settlement being reached between the parties regarding the issue of South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) in Malabe.
Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam made this remarks when the Appeal petition filed by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) challenging the judgment of the Court of Appeal to register a student of SAITM in Malabe was taken up for support.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing on behalf of the original petitioner, a MBBS graduate of SAITM, moved the three-judge-bench comprising Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice Anil Goonaratne that the request for leave to appeal by SLMC be refused.
He contended that the judgment made by the Court of Appeal to register students of SAITM provisionally as a medical practitioner in terms of section 29(2) of the Medical Ordinance cannot be challenged through this appeal because the facts presented by the SLMC in the appeal were not sufficient to challenge the Court of Appeal order.
He vehemently condemned the behaviour of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), which is continuously engaging in street protests and unnecessary strikes during the days the SAITM appeal was taken up for hearing.
Romesh de Silva PC will continue his oral submissions today (15). On a previous occasion, the Supreme Court had allowed the GMOA to intervene into the appeal filed by the SLMC. Through the appeal petition, the SLMC sought an order to set aside the judgment dated January 31, 2017 by the Court of Appeal.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for the SLMC. Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva with Sugath Caldera appeared for the respondent. Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam PC appeared on behalf of the Attorney General.
Presidents Counsel Faiz Musthapha appeared for SAITM. Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana with counsel Navin Marapana and Ravindranath Dabare appeared on behalf of Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA).

Union Bank becomes SLs first bank to receive PCI DSS Certification
Marking a significant turning point in data security protection, Union Bank became the first bank in Sri Lanka to receive the international Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) by the Security Standards Council.
The PCI Security Standards Council is a global forum for the ongoing development, enhancement, storage, dissemination and implementation of security standards for account data protection.
The PCI certification is a robust assurance of Union Banks data security standards across all systems and processes through which card and account transactions are effected.
Commenting on the achievement, Chief Executive Officer of Union Bank, Indrajit Wickramasinghe said, We are pleased to announce this significant security certification which is another industry first by Union Bank. The security of card and account data is of crucial importance to us as a financial institution. The breach or theft of card/account holder data would adversely affect the entire payment card ecosystem where customers would lose trust in merchants or financial institutions, and in turn business would get negatively affected. As a progressive bank that places greater focus on tech-enabled customer touch points, Union Bank is committed to advocating the highest levels of data security and following PCI security standards confirms our commitment to good business practices. The security benefits associated with maintaining PCI compliance are vital to the long-term success of the bank as well as our customers.
The PCI Standard Certification includes continual identification of threats and vulnerabilities that could potentially impact the organization. Such standards help ensure healthy and trustworthy payment card transactions for the multitudes of customers that maintain accounts linked to cards and credit facilities.
Union Bank is one of Sri Lankas leading banks supported by the strength of TPG, the US based global private investment firm with over US$70 billion in capital under management and an extensive global network with significant presence in Asia and Europe.
With a solid foundation etched with financial stability and international know-how, Union Bank is amongst the highest capitalised private commercial banks in Sri Lanka, offering a full range of products and services to personal and commercial financial sectors.

Unity govt aims to bring benefits: SLFP Youth Front
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Youth Front Chairman Shantha Bandara said the SLFP formed the unity government aiming to bring benefits to the country and its people.
Bandara was addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters.
He said introducing a new constitution and implementing a new electoral system are among the factors that were considered when forming the unity government.
Bandara said the 66th anniversary of the SLFP which was held successfully, showcased that the SLFP is not limited to its name board.
Certain members of the Joint Opposition said the SLFP is now limited to its name board but the 66th Convention of the party helped to null those allegations, he added.
Bandara said the Youth Front stands for the youth quota of Local Government elections. As a result of a discussion the Youth Front had with the President recently, the Central Committee (CC) of the SLFP has been instructed by the President to offer 30 percent quota for youths at the Local Government Elections.
We are opposing the decision to remove the youth quota when amending the local government election act, he said.
While speaking on the present political environment of the SLFP, Bandara said the party is strengthening gradually. People are rallying round the party every day, he added.
He said party-friendly members, who are at present with the Joint Opposition, would never get the membership of other parties.
Bandara speaking on the sil cloth issue said the lawsuit has shown that no one is above the law, he noted.
However, he added that it is unethical to comment on a Courts decision. It cannot be accepted that certain persons are commenting on the Courts decision in accordance with their political views.

Vying for Elfdom
A student determined to become a real-life elf has showed off the results of his latest surgery which includes a vampire-style hair transplant using his own blood.
Luis Padron became obsessed with the world of elves and angels after being bullied as a child. The 26-year-old underwent a hair transplant with specialist injections earlier this month in Beverly Hills in California, USA, to help further his dream of becoming a fantasy being.
The procedure that combines implanting over two thousand hair follicles and injecting him with stem cell platelet rich plasma will give him a widows peak and stimulate hair growth.
So far Luis has spent a whopping 36k trying to achieve his dream, but has at least eight more procedures planned.
Luis became determined to look like his favourite otherworldly characters and sourced inspiration from films including Labyrinth and The NeverEnding Story.
To look more like an elf, Luis started bleaching his skin and hair and now he has a 4,000-a-month ritual applying specialist creams, dyes, treatment and SPF100 sunscreen.
He splashed out on surgery including liposuction on his jaw, a rhinoplasty, full body hair removal and operations to change his eye colour.
Luis, from Buenos Ares, Argentina, gets stared at for his unusual look but says he doesnt care what people think and that he wont stop until he has fully transformed into an elf.
Hes planning surgery to make his ears pointed, hair implants for a heart-shaped hairline and a limb lengthening op to make him 6ft 5.
Luis, who sells cosplay merchandise, said: I want to be an elf, an angel and a fantasy being, my aim is to look inhuman, ethereal, graceful and delicate.
I have my own beauty ideal and want to achieve that no matter what. I want to have my ears cut to become pointy like an elves, my jaw to look more sharp like a diamond, a facelift and an eyelift to give my eyes a cat-like shape. I am also consider having muscle implants too. Theres also a surgery to make you taller and I will remove four of my ribs too, so that I can shape my waist to make it thinner. People have stared at me ever since I was a teenager, so its very normal to me now. I like people staring at me and dont care what they think, he said.
Even when Im not dressed up like an elf people stare at me. I have had long white hair for five years, I use larger contact lenses and I am very tall. I use make-up to enhance my features so they are more angelic and wear clothing thats more stylish or antique. I consider myself trans-species, in the same way transgender people feel, I need to become how I feel inside, I dont expect people to understand but I ask they respect it. The fantasy genre makes me happy and because I didnt have many friends when I was younger I submerged myself into it.
Luis fell in love with the fantasy genre during his early teens, while struggling with bullies who mocked him because he dyed his hair and had different dress sense.
But by the end of high school, Luis claims his quirkiness led to him being admired, which further fuelled his longing to be different.
He added: I was bullied as a child and as an escape I would submerge myself in fantasy movies like Labyrinth and The NeverEnding Story, as well as other fantasy tales. Over time things changed, older teens liked me because I was unique and thats what encouraged me to start turning what I felt on the inside into a reality. I started with cosplay but it wasnt enough, I wanted to change to become my own perception of beauty.
At the age of 14, he was determined to undergo surgery to look more like an elf and six years later he went under the knife for the first time.
Luis said: It was the start that led me to decide this was the direction I wanted my life to go in, the recovery was painful and slow but I was happy with how I looked. I didnt care for how much it hurt, because it allowed me to get one step closer to my dream of what I want to become.
In his question for fantasy perfection he continued to have over 40 fillers, full body hair removal, laser skin bleaching to remove any freckles and Botox.

World Suicide Prevention Day commemorated
Sumithrayo commemorated World Suicide Prevention Day at Independence Square amidst a large gathering. Many questions were directed to the panel of eminent persons who participated in the discussion. The panel included Dr.Razia Pendse, WHO Representative in Sri Lanka, Thirupathy Suveendran, WHO Colombo, Dr. Velauthapillai Jegaruban, MOH, Govt. Addiction Centre, Killinochchi Hospital, Dr. Neil Fernando, Senior Consultant Psychiatrist and U.R. De Silva, President of the Sri Lanka Bar Association.
The keynote address was by Dr. Razia Pendese who spoke about the significance of the theme Take a minute and change a life and articulated on how communities could contribute by reaching out to people in distress. She also detailed why some people have suicidal feelings and what signs we must look for in a vulnerable person.
Well-known theatre personality Indu Dharmasena shared his thoughts on why people who are distressed must seek help and why communities must also be sensitive and reach out to vulnerable people. Among the other speakers were Subodha Pilimatalawe from Seven Media Group who spoke about the digital campaign We Can where celebrities speak openly about depression and Ornella Gunasekera, who narrated her own story of how she overcame depression. The Rotary Club of Sri Jayewardenepura University staged a short, interesting skit that centered around - Taking a minute to change a life.
A pertinent fact that emerged from the panel discussion was that various web sites that quoted suicide statistics in the Internet, still ranked Sri Lanka as No. 4 in the world when actually we should be between No. 20 to No. 24 with 16 suicides per 100,000. This is expected to be rectified soon when WHO statistics are updated. The WHO also offered assistance to monitor and record attempted suicides in Sri Lanka to obtain a clearer picture. U.R. De Silva commented on the need for helplines such as Sumithrayo to be indicated at the end of the reports on suicides.
The event concluded with participants lighting candles in memory of those who had lost their lives, according to a news release.

High time for stronger inroads into Asian markets
Recent studies has shown that 44% of Sri Lankas exports are concentrated in just three markets USA, UK and India and confined to a few products and these trends must be reversed, said Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama.
So far, Sri Lanka has seen limited success in exporting to key Asian markets like Japan, China, South Korea and Hong Kong. These four countries are among the top 10 markets for exports in the world, accounting for 20% of the global export market, but accounted for only 6% of Sri Lankas exports.
It is high time we made stronger inroads in Asian markets, he said speaking at the EDB Presidential Export Awards ceremony yesterday. In terms of product composition, the study also showed that Sri Lankas two leading exports are not among the top 10 product categories traded in the world. In most other Asian countries the two key export products fall within at least one of the top five products traded in the world.
Export development is a top priority of this government and our goal for the next three years is to increase exports to US$20 billion by 2020. In the last three years, exports were stagnant in dollar terms and for over 15 years, exports have played a smaller and smaller part of the economy. From a share of 33% of GDP in 2000, exports declined to 12.7% of GDP in 2016. We cannot afford for this to continue. We have begun to tackle these, proactively and systematically.
National Export Strategy, being driven by the Export Development Board with technical support from the International Trade Centre in one initiative to reverse this. In addition to the National Export Strategy, we have embarked on broader trade policy reforms. Last month, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the adoption of a new National Trade Policy. We are also conscious of unfair trade practices that our Sri Lankan businesses have to contend with, and this is why we have formulated a robust anti-dumping legislation, which will hopefully be passed within this year.
There are a host of other important measures the Government is taking to expand market access for local exporters. The gains from all these initiatives wont be seen overnight and wont come automatically. We have to work together and work hard, to reap the benefits of these new agreements and new opportunities.

Amal Clooney urges Sri Lanka to ensure safety of Mohammed Nasheed

Human rights lawyer Amal Clooney is urging Sri Lankan authorities to respect the rights and ensure the safety of her client and former President of the Maldives Mohammed Nasheed should he set foot in the country.
Clooney on Wednesday raised fresh fears for the safety of her client, former Maldives president Mohamed Nasheed, after an official vowed to have him arrested and deported, AFP reported.
The London-based lawyer said she was "very concerned" about remarks by Male's ambassador-designate to Colombo, that he would have the exiled leader arrested if he set foot in Sri Lanka.
Clooney, who is married to Hollywood star George Clooney, had successfully petitioned a UN body which ruled in late 2015 that Nasheed was wrongfully convicted on a terrorism charge earlier that year and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention also ordered the government of President Abdulla Yameen immediately to free Nasheed and pay him compensation, a demand rejected by the Maldives.
Nasheed travelled to London in January last year on prison leave for medical treatment and has since then remained in self-imposed exile. He travels frequently to Sri Lanka to meet fellow dissidents.
The new Maldivian envoy to Sri Lanka, Mohamed Hussain Shareef, told a local television station Monday that he would have Nasheed arrested in Colombo should he visit and would deport him.
"If a Maldivian authority requests me to detain and return Mohamed Nasheed back to the Maldives, I will," Shareef said.
"It's very simple. They have to say, this is an individual who we are seeking. I'll even go out to the street myself and do it."
Clooney said Nasheed should not be returned to the Maldives to serve his prison sentence.
"Any attempt by a Maldivian diplomat to detain president Nasheed in Sri Lanka would constitute a violation of international law as well as Sri Lankan criminal law," she said according to a statement mailed to AFP by Nasheed's party.
She also said Sri Lankan authorities must ensure that Nasheed's rights were respected while he was in their country.
Her co-counsel Jared Genser said Shareef's remarks were "as outrageous as they are in flagrant violation of international law".
Nasheed's Maldivian Democratic Party said they were not taking Shareef's remarks lightly in view of the illegal arrest of a Maldivian national in Colombo in November 2015 and his deportation.
Sri Lanka's foreign ministry had in 2015 warned the Maldivian envoy in Colombo that any similar action in future could seriously damage relations.
The Maldives has faced tough international criticism over the jailing in March 2015 of Nasheed, the first democratically elected president, following a rushed trial which the UN said was politically motivated.
Yameen, who came to power following a controversial run-off against Nasheed in November 2013 faces international censure over his crackdown on dissidents.

Apple iPhone X adopts facial recognition, OLED screen
The iPhone X - which is referred to as ten - uses a facial recognition system to recognise its owner rather than a fingerprint-based one.
Apple said FaceID can work in the dark by using 30,000 infra-red dots to check an identity, and was harder to fool than its old TouchID system.
A 64 gigabyte capacity model will cost $999 (999 in the UK) when it goes on sale on 3 November. A 256GB version will be priced at $1,149 (1,149 in the UK).
By contrast, Samsung is charging $930 (869 in the UK) for its new Note 8 phone, which has 64GB of storage.
The iPhone X is a long-term investment by Apple that sets a template for the next generation of iPhone hardware, commented Geoff Blaber from the CCS Insight consultancy. (BBC)

The Minister of Labour and Social Development expressed to Ambassador Dr. Mendis his satisfaction of the Sri Lanka expatriate community working in Bahrain, for their contribution in progressing and advancing the economy of Bahrain.
The Minister also added that most of the employers, both public and private, were happy to work with Sri Lankans since they are highly committed, dedicated, adaptable, honest and competent. Dr. Mendis deeply appreciated the Minister for the contribution and facilitation extended to Sri Lankan expatriate nationals employed in Bahrain, over the years.
Dr Mendis enunciated the vitality of the migrant workers for Sri Lanka stating that they contribute nearly 9% of the total GDP. The contributions and remittances of the migrant workers are the highest and the largest in the country.

British journalist killed by crocodile in Sri Lanka

A British journalist was killed by a crocodile while washing his hands at a lagoon in Sri Lanka during a holiday with friends.
Paul McClean, 25, an Oxford University graduate, isunderstood to have wandered away from his group of friends to find a toilet when he was attacked.
The British victim, from Surrey, was seen "waving his hands in the air" in desperation before being dragged under water at a lagoon called Crocodile Rock near Arugam Bay.
Mr McCleangraduated from Oxford with a First Class Honours degree in French in 2015 before joining the Financial Times later that year.
He had covered Brexit and the EU for the newspaper and had recently returned to London after living in Brussels for a couple of months.
The lagoon, known to be crawling with crocodiles, is yards away from popular surf spotElephant Rock near Arugam Bay on the southeast coast.
Sri Lankan police and the army are said to be searching the shore surrounding the area.
Localsclaimed the victim had been staying at the East Beach Surf Resort - located just minutes away from the surfing area he went missing from.

Fawas Lafeer, owner of Safa Surf School, located up the coast from where the incident happened, said: A local fisherman witnessed a man being dragged into a river, set back from the beach, by a crocodile. The fisherman was on the opposite side of the river and downstream of the incident location."
He added:This is the first known crocodile attack in Sri Lanka. Both tourists and locals surf at Elephant Rock, which is a beautiful secluded beach and very safe.
Crocodiles in Sri Lanka live only in the fresh, back waters of the jungle. It is almost unheard of for them to come close to the beach. The salt water actually turns them blind.
Local search and rescue teams are working alongside the police and British Embassy in attempt to locate the man's body."
Meanwhile, a Scottish tourist, who wishes toremain anonymous, said: A British tourist was at a surf spot called Elephant rock.
"There's a lagoon right next to the sea. He went to the toilet next to the lagoon and was grabbed by a crocodile.
There are lots in the lagoon. People last saw his arms in the air in the water and then was grabbed under. I was there but didnt see it happen though. Horrible.
Tourists spoke of their shock after the attack
The holidaymaker was seen "waving his hands in the air" for help before being dragged under by the croc
They are searching for a body but havent found anything yet.
The army were down and there are people out on boats checking the shore because crocodiles won't eat anything in water - they will take it on to dry land to eat prey."
He said some locals had discussed the possibility that he may have fallen into the lagoon because of quicksand.
They are 90 per cent sure it was a crocodile but a couple of the guys said there was quicksand in the lagoon," the tourist said.
A few people that knew the guy were just on the ground, I didn't get that close but they all just seemed in shock and not saying much.
There were a large crowd of Sri Lankan men surrounding them and they had bits of paper.
SeanCarroll, from New South Wales, Australia, wrote on Facebook:A croc just took a tourist bloke in Sri Lanka.
He was walking on a beach where a small river meets the sea, its named Crocodile Rock for that reason obviously.
The lagoon is near Arugam Bay on the southeast coast
He still hasn't been retrieved from river. Heavy.
"Im sure he was close to the river for it to take him. Police looking and army too.
There are two different kinds of crocodile that live in Sri Lanka, the Marsh, or "mugger", crocodile and the saltwater crocodile.
One local from Panama village, 10km from Crocodile Rock, heard about the horrifying attack from his friends.
He told SunOnline: A British guy fell in the lagoon. There are lots of police searching the area.
It is a very dangerous place to swim, there have been lots of attacks.
In April of this year, a 13-year-old girl was attacked and dragged away by a crocodile while she was enjoying a day out with her family at Pulnewa Lake, in Galnewa.
The girl was reported missing by her family, who said they saw her being dragged into the water by the large reptile.
And in July 2016, a 60-year-old Sri Lankan man was also killed in a crocodile attack.
He had been fishing in the Paayindan River in Sammanthurai when he was attacked.
A colleague said: Were all totally stunned. He was a great kid, super bright. Its an absolute tragedy.

Ceylinco Lifes Family Savari doubles winners
The biggest has just got even bigger, with Ceylinco Life announcing that the beneficiaries of its Family Savari mega promotion with almost double the 2017 edition, the 11th in the series.
The dream destination for the grand prize in Family Savari 11 will be Rome, the company said, and 20 people from five policyholder families will win an all-expenses-paid holiday to the Eternal City in 2018.

Chalmers Granaries land  to be Colombos transport hub
The Multimodal Transport Hub concept in Fort proposed by the Megalopolis and Western Development Ministry received Cabinet approval to call for project investors.
The Hub was initially approved by Cabinet on October 19, 2016, and will involve Chalmers Granaries, opposite Fort Railway Station being converted into the Gate into the City of Colombo.
The land which was previously used by a private party as vehicle car park has been taken over by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) and the latter is now operating it for the same purpose.
The cabinet paper describing the project said the land has been earmarked for mixed development enhancing wider corridors for public to move and to connect to the proposed Multimodal Transport Hub in the Olcott Mawatha area and the financial district in the Northern Part of the Fort and strengthening the public access through the development for wholesale and retail market businesses in the Pettah area in the East.
As per the UDA development plan, the plot coverage is 50 percent and it is suggested a minimum of 40 percent land area be maintained for public space with and green coverage left adjacent to Olcott Mawatha. The UDA Planning and Urban Design guidelines prepared to develop the Colombo Fort and Pettah area will have to be followed by the selected investor.
The Hub will eventually connect to the proposed expressway connection to the Colombo city from the Katunayake Expressway. A large parking facility at the basement level and space for office and commercial establishment are proposed within the building complex in the hub.

Roald Dahls widow and biographer say first Charlie was black but writer was persuaded to make him white

Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe, Peter Ostrum as Charlie and Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka in the 1971 film based on the book.
Roald Dahl originally wanted the eponymous hero of his much-loved childrens book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to be black, his widow has said.
In an interview with BBC Radio 4s Today programme for Roald Dahl day on Wednesday, Liccy Dahl said: His first Charlie that he wrote about was a little black boy.
Asked why it was changed, she replied: I dont know. Its a great pity.
Her husbands biographer Donald Sturrock, who was also being interviewed, said the change to a white character was driven by Dahls agent, who thought a black Charlie would not appeal to readers.
I can tell you that it was his agent who thought it was a bad idea, when the book was first published, to have a black hero, said Sturrock. She said people would ask: Why
The revelation about Dahls original wish for Charlie may surprise those who accused the author of racism in relation to the book. The allegation stemmed from the fact that the Oompa Loompas in the original version were black pygmies from Africa.
The news in 1970 that there was to be a film of the book drew the attention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to the work and they said the importation of the Oompa Loompas to the factory had overtones of slavery.
Dahl insisted there was no racist intent behind the Oompa Loompas but also said he found himself sympathising with the NAACP.
As a result, he rewrote them in time for the second US edition as white hippyish dwarves hailing from an invented place, Loompaland. The film, starring Gene Wilder, avoided the issue of race altogether, making them green-haired and orange-skinned.
In 2016, the Bookseller said Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was Dahls bestselling book across editions with almost 1m sales.
It said the follow-up, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, had sold about 375,000 copies.

Civil Aviation Training Centre - SL conducts ICAO Training Instructor Course Part 2
The Civil Aviation Training Centre, Sri Lanka was the venue for the ICAO Training Instructor Course (TIC) Part 2 that was delivered from September 4-8. The course was delivered by Ismael Faraji, ICAO TRAINAIR PLUS Programme Expert, who is also a permanent faculty member of the Civil Aviation Technology College of Iran.
The course was conducted exclusively for 10 senior instructors of the CATC. With the successful conclusion of this course, the CATC Sri Lanka now has a senior faculty trained directly by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) which would tremendously enhance its competitive edge.
The ICAO TIC has two parts. Part 1 which is an eLearning course comprises 30 hours of online learning. Part 2 is delivered in a classroom and is of one-week's duration. All 10 senior instructors of the CATC first completed Part 1 online to become eligible to follow part 2.
The CATC is run by Airport & Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd (AASL), the state- owned blue chip company that operates the islands international airports and the Colombo airport.
AASL is also the Air Navigation Services Provider (ANSP) for the Colombo Flight Information Region, a vast oceanic air space of approximately 900,000 square kilometres extending mostly to the east of Sri Lanka.
The CATC was established in 1984 under a UNDP funded project implemented by the ICAO. At present the CATC conducts training in Air Traffic Control, Aeronautical Communications, Air Traffic Safety Electronics, Aeronautical Information Services, Airport Security, Airport Fire Services and Airport Management, all of which belong to the forte of Airport & Aviation Services.
It provides the company staff regular refresher training as well as career development training to enable them man critical airport operations and air navigation services. In addition to classroom training, the CATC also maintains a virtual training wing that provides eLearning for company employees.
The CATC is a full member of the TRAINAIR PLUS programme of the ICAO since 2014.
ICAO TRAINAIR PLUS is a global cooperative network of aviation training institutions delivering high quality training and sharing it amongst themselves. Presently there are only 57 aviation training institutions worldwide that enjoy this full accreditation. Fourteen of those are in the Asia Pacific Region and CATC Sri Lanka is proud to be one of them. It is also the only institution in Sri Lanka that enjoys this accreditation at present.
TRAINAIR PLUS members have to meet stringent requirements stipulated by the ICAO which covers instructional design, training delivery, training quality assurance, trainer quality assurance, record keeping and documentation. All members are thoroughly assessed initially by the ICAO and then reassessed once every three years.
CATC Sri Lanka successfully underwent its last reassessment in September 2015 and is gearing itself for its next reassessment in 2018.
Since gaining full membership in the TRAINAIR PLUS programme, CATC Sri Lanka is gradually emerging as a regional aviation training institution. Over the past few years, it has regularly provided training to a growing number of airport operational personnel from Maldives, Nepal and Nigeria while inquiries from many other countries are being processed.
The entire faculty of the CATC comprise qualified and trained personnel drawn from the companys operations who have years of experience in their trades. The faculty is also supplemented by visiting resource personnel from the universities, airlines and other key players in the industry.
The Instructional Design Unit of the CATC has Course Developers trained by the ICAO and is equipped with facilities to develop training courses that deploy state-of-the-art delivery methods such as blended learning.
The CATC is also an institution registered with the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission of Sri Lanka for the provision of vocational training. In 2011, the CATC offered the first ever Diploma programme in Aviation Studies to be conducted in Sri Lanka by a state organization.
This programme which has already been conducted five times and is in progress for the sixth cohort, is aimed at providing trained and qualified personnel for the junior and middle managerial positions in the local aviation industry and its allied industries and targets the large population of A level qualified youngsters who are aspiring for avenues of tertiary education. The CATC also runs several non-aviation programmes for the local industry and general public.
Realizing the vast potential of the CATC as an effective aviation trainer, AASL has launched several projects for its further development.
Two flagship projects are underway for the replacement of the existing Air Traffic Control 2D simulator with a state of the art 3D simulator and to upgrade the Navigational Aids training facilities. Both projects are scheduled to be completed early next year.
The CATC also has a comprehensive information resource centre in civil aviation which has a large assortment of reference material pertaining to various aspects of the aviation industry as well as general reading material. The CATC plans to open this resource centre to the general public as well in the near future.
Speaking at the closing ceremony of the course held on September 8 at the CATC auditorium, AASL Vice Chairman Ranjith De Silva stated that the company is at a critical stage of development with several development projects in the pipeline and emphasized the importance of training the industrys human resources in order to make these developments meaningful. The Executive Director AASL Johanne Jayaratne was also present.
We plan to provide training in trades connected with airport operations to Sri Lankans so that they can take up employment overseas, says Eng. Athula Seneviratne, the head of the CATC, explaining its institutional and national role. As a TRAINAIR PLUS member we are entitled to borrow and deliver the courses developed by other members which are available in a library managed by the ICAO. At present there are nearly 100 courses in this growing library. We too have contributed two courses to it, the Advanced Test and Measuring Techniques course and the AIS/MAP Publication Specialist course both of which are in high demand. We plan to contribute two more courses next year. Our aim is to become the most sought after aviation training institution in the region.
By having its own training centre, AASL makes a massive saving annually while substantial revenue is also earned by the offering of training to external clients, the greater part of it being foreign exchange.

CNCI wants concessionary tax rates for exporters sans limits
The Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI) appealed to the government to maintain the concessionary tax rates granted to exporters and indirect exporters.
Under the new Inland Revenue Act only a business with exports of at least 80% of their turnover will qualify for a concessionary tax rate. And this withdrawal of concessionary income tax rate will be applicable to direct, indirect exports. A small price differential can result in securing an export order or losing it altogether to a competitor from another country.The concessionary income tax rate offered to exporters was an incentive for companies to enter into the export market.
An existing business cannot enter an export market to export 80 % of their production initially. Most exporters entered the export market with small orders and gradually increased export volumes. It is therefore important to incentivize every individual export if the intention of the Government is to encourage newcomers to enter the export market. This was achieved hitherto by granting a concessionary tax rate to the profit attributable to export turnover, irrespective of its value to total turnover.
Successive governments have made a concerted effort to promote Sri Lankan exports. In their endeavor to promote exports a concessionary tax rate was granted to profits attributable to export related turnover. The Chamber claimed that they represent many indirect exporters who have immensely benefited from such tax concessions.
They were able to price their products to exporters lower than what they would offer to the local market considering the benefit of taxation.
Only established exporters stand to gain from tax concessions offered to companies achieving an 80 % export target. Some of the large exporters today too would have had a low % of their turnover as exports in their initial years of operations. Would they have pursued an export strategy if tax incentives were not available even with a lower % of export turnover
caption CNCI Chairman, Tissa Seneviratne
The chamber said that they recognize the importance of additional revenue by removal of tax concessions. However, CNCI is mindful that the government also considers the growth of exports as an integral component of economic development of the country. What would be the overall impact when a concession enjoyed by many businesses up to now is withdrawn overnight The chamber appeal to the government to maintain the concessionary tax rates granted to exporters & indirect exporters irrespective of the volume of their exports.
The Government launched a National Programme this year to nurture 2000 new entrepreneurs to become exporters. The proposes increase of taxation will adversely impact on the entrepreneurs coming under this programme which certainly is not the intention of the Government. These entrepreneurs would have prepared their business plans considering the concessionary tax rate applicable to exporters.

DE SILVA a leg spinning all-round legend
D. S. De Silva perfected the art of leg spin and deservedly he is a legend of class. In crickets folk lore he has a rightful place. Of all the arts of bowling, the most difficult is leg spin bowling. To be efficient and successful in this style of bowling one must master the entire repertoire associated with this art.
Starting with the leg spin, one must master and be able to bowl the googly which is bowled with a leg spinning action with the back of the hand towards the batsman, but when pitched turns into an off break and baffles the batsman. The top spinner is the one that skids and goes straight. There are other variations in this style of bowling too.
Not very many bowlers would want to take to leg spin bowling because it requires hours of bowling at the nets. One must toil hard and shed a lot of sweat to finally master the art and once mastered could cause mayhem in opposing batsmen.
Top class leg spinners
In the pre Test era the country hard top class bowlers of this type  Gamini Goonesena and Ivers Gunesekera. Then in the school circuit in the late 1950s there was Michael Tissera, Lareef Idroos (S. Thomas), Vere De Silva (St.Sebastians), Raja de Silva (St. Josephs), SarathVithanage (Royal) and the writer (St. Benedicts).
Joining this illustrious company and after the country gained Test status was DANDENIYAGE SOMACHANDRA DE SILVA, who learnt his trade at Mahinda College, Galle before finishing up at Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa from where he graduated to playing top league club cricket at Nomads, finishing up as the best leg spin/googly bowler in the early pre Test era and post Test era.
De SILVA did not have a long run in the Test arena because age caught up with him and he had to move on. But during the short period that he was in the international scene he performed his art of bowling that had many an opposing international batsman speaking in awe about his prowess.
His best moment
He probably enjoyed his best moment when Sri Lanka beat a mighty Indian side in a memorable match in the 1979 World Cup in England by 47 runs. Although his figures were not mind boggling the three wickets he took for 29 was enough to send India crashing to 191 all out. He hand the prized wickets of Brijesh Patel, DilipVengskar and Mohinder Amaranath. Sri Lanka batting first had made 236.
It was unfortunate that DE SILVA had to showcase his magic with the ball for the country when nearing 40. Before that in the domestic scene he showed his all-round class scoring heavily as a right hand batsman and spinning his magic to baffle all batsmen.
In his trade he believed in flight, good variation and mixed his variety of deliveries to scuttle out batsmen. The selectors of that time took notice of this great all-rounder. When a strong Marley Bourne Cricket Club team toured here in 1973 when Ceylon had changed its name to Sri Lanka, DE SILVA ran rings round the MCC batsmen and he was rewarded with the wickets of Mike Denness, Tony Greig and Roger Tolchard.
Praise from Windies
He nearly bowled the country to victory against a strong West Indies team that included Viv Richards, Roy Fredricks and Clive Lloyd he had match bag of five for 150 but had the West Indians talking highly of his bowling prowess.
DE SILVAS world class spin bowling was done long before the country attained Test status. Playing for the country whenever foreign teams played here, he showed his spinning ability and when an Indian team played here in 1975 he spun out nine men in a match bag.
Then a few months later against a full strength Pakistan team he helped the country to a memorable triumph taking eight wickets including the scalps of Zaheer Abbas, Javed Miandad, Wasim Raja, Imran Khan, Haroon Rashid, Intikhab Alam and Sarfraz Nawaz. The Pakistani batsmen who are masters of playing spin were simply bamboozled by the variety of spin imparted by DE SILVA.
Past his prime
Finally in1982 1CC granted the country Test status on Sri Lanka and by that time DE SILVA had past his prime, yet not lost the control of his repertoire of spin. He was a few months short of 40 when Sri Lanka played their first official Test against Keith Fletchers England team at the P.Sara Stadium, before fronting up to the Englishmen. He had a successful run with Shropshire in the minor county championship in England.
DE SILVAS first Test wicket came in that Test when he had David Gower mistiming and then gobbled up the wickets of Paul Allot and Derek Underwood and he had figures of 27.5-11-54-3 which was memorable. But sadly Sri Lanka lost the Test.
Then when Sri Lanka made its first full Test tour to Pakistan in 1982 he showed his excellence. In the first Test he took four wickets and in the Second had three. In the following Test in Faisalabad he became the first Sri Lankan bowler to take five wickets, ending with a match bag of nine wickets,a truly remarkable performance.
Opportunity of captaining
When Sri Lanka toured New Zealand DE SILVA had the opportunity of captaining when DuleepMendis was injured and batting at number six made a half century. However he scored his career best knock of 61 in the next Test. With age catching up he starred in the 1983 World Cup Sri Lanka victory by baffling the Kiwi batsmen with figures of 12-6-11-2 which was respectable.
DE SILVA finally hung up his boots after the 1985 Benson and Hedges World Championship game in Australia. In all DE SILVA played in 12 Tests scoring 406 runs with 61 as his highest score and bagged 37 wickets with five for 59 being his best.
He played 41 ODIS making 371 runs with 37 not out as his highest and with the ball he had 32 wickets with three for 29 as his best.
When DE SILVA after a brief stint with school cricket where he brushed up their game was appointed Chairman of the Interim Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket and it was a popular choice what with his immense cricketing background. He took over this onerous slot with Sri Lanka having to host the 2011 Twenty20 World Cup.
Following Dissanayakes example
Following the example set by former President of Sri Lanka Cricket the irreplaceable Gamini Dissanayake he concentrated on his job as an administrator and let the other committees do their jobs. This was an admirable strategy and the end result was that Sri Lanka led by Mahela Jayewardene entered the 2011 T20 final but was unlucky to lose the final to the West Indies at the R. Premadasa Stadium.
With the T20 World Cup looming it fell to him to redo and build stadiums to host this prestigious tournament. He worked tirelessly and egged the workers on to turn jungle land in Hambantota into the imposing Sooriyawewa Stadium.
It was a cricketing miracle that he performed. Then he redid the R. Premadasa Stadium and also saw to the birth of the Pallekelle Stadium.
ICC officials who visited the country to see how the work was progressing spoke in glowing terms and praised De SILVA for a job well done. I can vouch for the hard work he put in because he was very close to me, having played against each other and being bowlers of the same type.
Since retiring from the game, Sri Lanka has yet to find a leg spinning all-rounder of DE SILVAS class. He certainly is a LEGEND.

The destruction                         of Hikkaduwas coral reefs
Sri Lankas coral reefs have long been attracting tourists from around the world. According to research stemming back to the 1980s, about two percent of the countrys coastline contains nearshore fringing reefs. Peppering the sea-beds of the Indian Ocean, these coral reefs are home to a host of marine life making them both aesthetically pleasing and environmentally consequential.
The coral reefs were bleached in 1998, with the other impacts in the Indian Ocean, due to the El Nio effect
In and around the waters of Hikkaduwa, specifically, these coral reefs are part of the Hikkaduwa Marine Sanctuary, the first such designated sanctuary in Sri Lanka. And theyve gained a reputation among visitors who come from near and far to see them up close. All along Galle Road in the area, there are diving shops and individual instructors offering the opportunity to snorkel or scuba dive, among them.
But, there is trouble in paradise.
Trouble in Paradise
Most of the coral here have waved goodbye, said Kalu Priyantha, the founder of Blue Deep Diving Centre in Hikkaduwa, who has been working in the diving business here since 1995. By goodbye, he means the coral has died or been bleached.
Everyone asks about corals this, corals that. People come to see their bright colours and all the fish swimming around them. And when I tell them many are dead, then they dont even want to snorkel. Its hurting our business because the tourists expect living corals.
Unbeknownst to many, coral reefs are not abiotic structures but clusters of thousands of tiny sea animals called polyps. Theyre alive, always growing and changing and evolving. In doing so, they become hotbeds of biodiversity, providing a home for at least 25 percent of all marine species, even though they occupy less than 0.1 percent of the worlds ocean surface. But coral reefs, just like any living being, are susceptible to death if they arent properly cared for or if they are constantly under threat. And in the Hikkaduwa Marine Sanctuary, that is exactly whats happening.
Degradation of reefs
According to Dr. Arjan Rajasuriya, the International Union for Conservation of Natures (IUCN) Marine and Coastal Thematic Area Coordinator in Sri Lanka and one of the two leading proponents of the creation of the Hikkaduwa Marine Sanctuary in 1985, there are a host of factors responsible for the degradation of the reefs.
The coral reefs were bleached in 1998, with the other impacts in the Indian Ocean, due to the El Nio effect, explained Rajasuriya. During that time, a climatic phenomenon known as El Nio generated a warm ocean current that increased the temperature of the sea in Hikkaduwa by 5 degrees Celsius, which in turn reduced the number of live coral cover from 47 percent to just 13 percent.
Healthy coral reef
This is where climate change and global warming come in, for the El Nio effect is but one of its many consequences. Healthy corals play host to microscopic algae that live in their tissues, act as their primary food source, and give them their coral. But when the coral becomes stressed due to pollution, or, as is the case with El Nio, and increased oceanic temperature, the algae flees the coral tissue. Without the algae, the coral loses its major source of food, turns white or very pale, and becomes more susceptible to disease. This is what is meant by coral bleaching.
Everyone asks about corals this, corals that. People come to see their bright colours and all the fish swimming around them. And when I tell them many are dead, then they dont even want to snorkel. Its hurting our business because the tourists expect living corals
Often, coral reefs can recover, if not entirely, from episodes of bleaching. Some species are fairly tolerant of partial bleaching, said Rajasuriya. But when asked about the current status of Hikkaduwas reefs, almost 20 years after El Nio caused mass coral bleaching in the Indian Ocean, Rajasuriya responded with little optimism.
Very poor, because there are other negative impacts that are there, particularly filling the area with sand, which is something that is happening naturally, he said.
Rajasuriya explained that there was an improvement to Hikkaduwas fishery harbour after the Boxing Day Tsunami in 2004, an extension added to the Southern breakwater of the harbour. Unintentionally, this accelerated the filling of sand inside the sanctuary, leading the area to become extremely shallow and sand deposition within it to be quite high.
As a result, recovery is very slow and only certain species are able to tolerate that kind of sedimentation or sand accumulation. Those are the ones that are there now. Most of the corals, particularly the branching corals, have never recovered fully after the 98 bleaching event.
Human activity can harm or help
Further human activity could be working to improve the conditions that would best allow for the reefs to recover. Instead, were making it worse.
People are still walking on the reefs, climbing onto the corals, and so on. The glass bottom boats are still operating over the corals and tend to bump into the corals. These boats are using engines with fuel containing kerosene, and as a result there is the exhaust fume of kerosene, which doesnt burn completely and mixes with the sea water.
Much of the degradation of the coral reefs has already happened or is no longer preventable. According to Rajasuriya, there is no longer a way to stop the coral bleaching.
That is no longer within the control of humans. It will go on, because climate change is happening. We have set that in motion and cant put a brake on it in a hurry.
However, he maintains some optimism.
There are some species that are fairly tolerant of the level of bleaching that is happening now. So they get partially bleached and then they recover. And then maybe after another two years they get another partial bleaching and then again they recover a little bit. Like that it goes on. Many of the corals in Hikkaduwa go through this process now. They can adapt to some extent, as long as the effects of climate change dont accelerate rapidly, and the sand accumulation does not accelerate. There will be some recovery taking place.
The key, he insists, is to ensure that whatever corals are undergoing recovery completely avoid exploitative human activity. Since the Hikkaduwa Marine Sanctuary was formed under the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance, which falls under the Department of Wildlife Conservation, Rajasuriya says the department has a big role to play in this regard. He says the department has taken a positive step by attempting to regulate the glass-bottom boats by requiring the trips to be ticketed. Still, he says, there is more that can be done.
The Department of Wildlife Conservation needs to be more proactive and prevent people from walking on the reef. They should advise people who are about to go snorkelling, and advise the various diving stations how they should inform their customers about what to do inside the sanctuary. And generally, they should patrol the area. They have a responsibility to look after whatever is remaining there.
If human activity is channelled toward aiding rather than abusing the coral reefs in Hikkaduwas Marine Sanctuary, they will have a chance at recovery. Still, restoration to what the reefs once were, before the bleaching incident in 1998 and the subsequent threats to their survival, is unlikely.
It is not a total write-off, Rajasuriya said. But, you cant expect it to have the same conditions, the same amount of coral, the same beauty, as it once had.

Devapriya urges government to hold PC election on electoral level
Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya on Wednesday, urged the government to hold the Provincial Council election on an electoral level, if the government is ready to hold the Local Government election in the same manner. Even the next General election can be held in the same manner and this will save state money and resources.
"We did not agree with some of the features of the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution as it violates the 13th Amendment. According to the Amendment, Parliament will take over the existing powers of the Chief Minister and the President.
Therefore, we with the support of all political party members in the WPC formulated a set of proposals to be included in the 20th Amendment. Accordingly, we are not opposing the holding of elections in all Provincial Councils on the same day.
But, parliament should not be allowed to decide on the date of the Provincial Council election except the proposed forthcoming election.
The proposals of the Western Provincial Council (WPC) in connection with the 20th Amendment have been forwarded both to the President and the Prime Minster. The government has already accepted them.
Therefore, we will forward our proposals to Parliament when the 20th Amendment is presented to Parliament, he added. The Chief Minister also said that attention has been paid to commence free health clinics in schools to diagnose cancers among school children. It has been revealed that childhood cancer is on the rise.
"Therefore, we request the parents to be vigilant about their children and seek early diagnosis and treatment, he added.

Development Assistants on Womens Affairs from 2018
Development Assistants on Women's Affairs will be appointed for all Divisional Secretariats from 2018, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He was addressing the meeting of GS Officers and Development Officers at Temple Trees, yesterday.
The absence of proper planning of women's affairs at the grassroots level is essential. It should be addressed immediately to meet future objectives of the government on women's affairs.
The Premier said the women in Sri Lanka are over 52 percent of the population. However, there is still no proper plan for addressing women's issues at district and divisional level.
The government has already taken a decision to enhance female participation in local government bodies from 25 percent to 100 percent.
There should be a grassroots level mechanism to encourage and make women aware of this to achieve aims. Therefore, the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry has taken the decision to appoint Development Assistants on Women's Affairs with the assistant of Child and Women's Affairs Ministry and the Home Affairs Ministry, said the Prime Minister. These officers are required to undergo two to three weeks training before recruiting them. Special training on women's affairs will also be conducted for Divisional Secretaries. We hope to introduce this mechanism at the district level as well, said the Premier. During the party leaders meeting, party leaders requested the Elections Commission Chairman to hold Local Government elections soon after ending the Budget debate. We hope that elections would be held in January, he added.
Once new members are elected to Local Government bodies, we will be able to work with female representatives and work for the betterment of women. We are currently discussing with the Finance Ministry to include some programmes on womens affairs in the Budget proposals. By doing that, we would be able to achieve the basic goals of the government with regard to womens affairs, the Premier said.

EU praises Lankas  progress on HR, labour and environmental standards
The European Union praised the government for the progress made in advancing human rights, labour and environmental standards, but stressed that there were many areas where reform had yet to be delivered.
A team of senior officials from Brussels have been in the country for the last 10 days on a fact-finding mission.
The mission has focused on the status of the implementation of 27 international conventions, of which Sri Lanka is a signatory, the EU office in Sri Lanka said.
Progressive implementation of the conventions is the condition for continued preferential access to the European Union market - the worlds largest and Sri Lankas biggest export market  under the GSP Plus.
The team had a range of meetings with ministers, civil society, trade unions and international organisations. They also travelled to Jaffna and Kilinochchi to meet the Northern Province Chief Minister and hear the views from civil society, including human rights activists.
Following a meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Ambassador Tung-Lai Margue said: The cooperation by the government is a reminder of how much the situation has changed in the country over the last two and a half years, including advances in human rights. But there are important concerns about the lack of concrete progress in key areas.
It is of paramount importance that the government delivers on its commitments, including replacing the Prevention of Terrorism Act with counter-terrorism legislation consistent with international standards and allowing people in custody to have access to a lawyer from the point of arrest. Clarifying the fate of those who disappeared at the end of the war and speeding up the return of land will help restore confidence, particularly in the North and East, in the policy of national reconciliation.
Concerns were also raised about continued discrimination against women and girls and against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Sri Lankans, Margue said.
The assessment, along with that of the other countries benefitting from GSP Plus, will be published in January 2018. It will be considered by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.

Flexible office hours in  Battaramulla
The staff of Public Offices in Battaramulla will enjoy flexible office hours from September 18 on wards in an attempt to reduce the entrance of vehicles to the City during office peak hours, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.
The measure is taken in the government's bid to reduce the traffic congestion in Colombo in its attempt to save around Rs. 1 billion wasted on roads daily. The minister said due to traffic congestion, the waste of fuel and time of the people has been estimated to be around Rs. One billion.
He made these observation at a press conference held at the Ministry Auditorium in Suhurupaya, Battaramulla.
Minister Ranawaka also that the staff of the public sector in Battaramulla would be allowed to report to their offices from 7.30 am to 9.15 with the consent of their heads, while they also have the opportunity of leaving the office after covering the due number of working hours. They would be allowed to get off from work between 3.15 pm to 5 pm.
"However, they would have to work from 9.15 pm to 3.15 pm. This has to be done with the mutual understanding between the officers and their heads," Minister Ranawaka pointed out. He further said the government had spent approximately around Rs One trillion during 2005 to 2014 on the construction of roads in the country. He added that around 40 percent of the loans had been taken to construct these roads. "The construction of roads has facilitated easy transportation, but have not solved the issue of traffic congestion in Colombo."
Minister Ranawaka said there are 41 public offices including ministries located in Battaramulla and another 113 have to be shifted to Battaramulla during the next three years.
"As a solution to traffic congestion in Colombo, the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry took measures to introduce Priority Bus Lanes which is successful, except near Parliamenmt," Minister Ranawaka said.
"We have studied that if 1,450 buses ply along the road in Battaramulla in an hour, the average speed of the vehicles is around 10 kmph. But if we can reduce the number of vehicles by 250, we can increase the average speed to 20 kmph."
He also invited the private bus owners to use quality buses for transporting commuters. He added that the first private bus is displayed at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) premises for exhibition.

GMOA anti-SAITM vehicle parade to enter Colombo today

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) anti-SAITM vehicle parade is due to enter Colombo with 5,000 vehiclestoday.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said on September 7, that when the parade reaches Colombo the entire city will be blocked and disrupted of all activities.
The vehicle parade travelled around the country on September 12, 13 and 14.
The demonstration is held in protest of governments failure to solve the SAITM issue.

GMOA in open political mode
The GMOA has got into open political mode and is set to swamp the Colombo city with a vehicle parade today, similar to the ratha pelapaliyas and jana goshas and what have you, reminiscent of the salad days of their mentor, nay benefactor, Mahinda Rajapaksa. GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge has gone to the extent of issuing a warning to the public not to arrive in the capital city today, lest they be caught up the vehicle jam. This, by a group of medical professionals who have taken the Hippocratic Oath to devote their lives and time in the care of the sick and the suffering.
One is unable to say how many pregnant mothers, about to deliver, heart patients needing prompt treatment, accident victims etc. will be caught up in this traffic snarl. It will also be anybody's guess as to how many of these patients, needing immediate attention, will depart this world after being denied urgent medical attention, with their being stranded by the vehicle parade or remaining at home, heeding the dire warning of the good doctors, not to arrive in the city.
The GMOA has already launched token strikes in several districts, to give added impetus to today's grand finale, not caring a whit about the plight of patients whose interest and well-being they claim to have at heart, in fighting for abolishing SAITM. Interestingly, the CEB Trade Unions too have launched a strike that coincides with GMOA's deventha ratha pelapaliya which may or may not be a grand design by the state health and power sectors to place the government in difficulty. With mini elections fast approaching (According to the Election Commissioner the LG poll will be held in January), disruptive activity and sabotage can only escalate, with the unlimited financial resources commanded by the Rajapaksas put to good use. A sample of this was on display when former First Lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa was brought before the CID the other day, where, busloads of supporters descended on police headquarters, in a show of strength, which only a government in power has the capacity and resources to muster. A sustained campaign of the type carried out by the anti-SAITM brigade cannot survive without a massive fund infusion. The agitators are not confined to medical students, who are large enough, but students of other disciplines and even schoolchildren who may be in the dark as to what it is all about. The candlelight vigils and the present relay fasts, in front of the Fort Railway station tells a tale.
Be that as it may, the government should act firmly to prevent anarchy to reign in the guise of trade union action. All measures should be taken to ensure normal life prevails in the city today. As is all too clear, the SAITM issue is only a smokescreen in a larger political design to bring the Rajapaksas back to power. That the GMOA, is in the forefront of this sinister campaign is quite obvious, given that it remained mum when SAITM first came into being in 2012 and made, not a whimper of protest, when a private medical facility was established at the Kotelawala Defence Academy.
The speech made by the GMOA President Dr. Anurudhdha Padeniya opposite the Fort Railway station, that followed yet another anti-SAITM protest, also showed in which direction the GMOA campaign was heading. His (Padeniya's presence at a book launch of Wimal Weerawansa is also indicative of where the GMOA's sympathies lay. It's (GMOA's) exclusive choosing of a private TV channel, that makes no bones of it's support for the Rajapaksas, to cover a doctors health camp, during the recent floods, could not have been an accident.
It is time the government took stock of the situation and acted accordingly. As a government, it behoves on it to ensure normal civilian life continues smoothly without disruption. A few Trade Unions should not be allowed to have its own way, at the expense of the public. Besides, a country's capital city lain siege frequently by demonstrations, protests and vehicle parades is going to send a wrong message to would be investors. It is plain that the trouble makers are taking advantage of the government's tolerance of democratic dissent and are overstepping their bounds.
The vehicle parade demonstration is held while solutions are being worked out to both, the GMOA's issues and the matter of the salary anomalies of the CEB engineers. Hence, it is clear that today's grand show is being held under political sponsorship.
It is indeed strange as to why those members of the Sangha who are making a big song and dance and collecting money from the public to pay the fines of two convicts, who were sentenced for misusing millions of public funds, are maintaining a deafening silence when doctors are turning their backs on suffering patients, leaving them to die. Has even one of these good Samaritans come forward to ask the GMOA doctors not to shirk their responsibility of tending to the sick, which is a core precept in the noble teachings of the Buddha

Govt. calls for all CEB casual and temporary staff to report to work

The government has requested all casual and temporary staff and employees currently serving probationary period at the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to report to work with immediate effect.
The request comes on the heels of a request made earlier today asking staff retired after September 1, 2014 to report to duty on a voluntary basis to ensure uninterrupted essential services to the public.
The government is determined to provide uninterrupted electricity supply around the clock to more than 5.5 million customers and said that all employees who do not report to work would be considered as having vacated their positions.
Trade unions attached to the CEB are currently in their 4th consecutive day striking against the government are making over several demands which include the revision of the salary ratio from 1:6 to 1:9.
