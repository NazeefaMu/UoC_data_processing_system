Austria celebrates 200 years of Silent Night


AUSTRIA: Austria has something special to celebrate this festive period as it marks 200 years since the first performance of one of the worlds most beloved Christmas carols, Silent Night.
Celebrations of the anniversary will culminate with a special December 24 performance of Stille Nacht at the chapel in Oberndorf village, near Salzburg, where it was first performed 200 years ago to the day.
We are expecting around 6,000 people this Christmas Eve, where normally we would have 3-4,000, Clemens Konrad, the head of Oberndorfs tourism office, told AFP.
The songs origins gave little hint as to the global renown it would achieve, being translated into 300 languages and dialects.
It was originally written as a poem by priest Joseph Mohr in 1816, a time of great suffering in the wake of Europes Napoleonic wars.
Two years later, Mohr asked his friend, the organist, choirmaster and schoolteacher Franz Xaver Gruber, to compose a melody.
The carol was first performed to a modest church congregation of ship labourers and their families. Years after its premiere, Gruber wrote that it had met with general approval by all among the congregation.
The carol became known outside Austria when it was incorporated into the repertoire of two travelling singing groups. The Rainer Singers and the Strasser Siblings performed it around Europe and beyond -- including the United States.
Mohr and Gruber are today honoured in around a dozen sites locally, many of which have been hosting special events this Christmas season to mark the anniversary.
Pope Francis has declared Silent Night to be his favourite song, even if he was unable to accept an invitation from Salzburgs regional government to take part in the anniversary celebrations.
Travel operators have included special stops on their itineraries to mark the anniversary, and visitors have come from as far afield as Sri Lanka and Japan, said Konrad.
The first English versions of Silent Night can be traced back to the middle of the 19th century and in the decades that followed it could be heard on every continent, propagated notably by Christian missionaries.
Since then, it has been recorded many hundreds of times by stars ranging from Bing Crosby to Miley Cyrus.
Some of the more original interpretations have come from the likes of John Denver with the Muppets, and the gravel-voiced satanic German rock group Erloesung.

RANIL UNSHAKABLE
The gigantic mass uprising for Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and democracy that happened last week is probably unique in the third world. It is unique with national unity abandoning racism and communalism. In the Galle Face Green, it was inspiring to see people of all kind in a spirit of solidarity. They expect the arrival of Lankan nation and defeat of fascism.
Free and fair elections are, no doubt, central to a democracy; but when conducted in the wake of the questionable sacking of Parliament, they may be anything but. Lanka is at a crossroads where it has to make a crucial choice between democratic consolidation and a retreat to authoritarianism.
Judiciary independent
The judiciary has a crucial task at hand; so far they played well, extremely well. In fact many political analysts claim that democratic steps taken by Yahapalanaya; such as return of commissions reducing the power of President to appoint Judges has made judiciary more independent. Yes, but in this case the mass uprising of people demanding justice must have an induction within the judiciary too.
We are in a situation somewhat similar to the civil war in America where Abraham Lincoln was challenged by racist white Americans. Abraham Lincoln, also a lawyer, legislator and vocal opponent of slavery, was elected 16th President of the United States in November 1860, shortly before the outbreak of the Civil War. Lincoln proved to be a shrewd military strategist and a savvy leader: His Emancipation Proclamation paved the way for slaverys abolition, while his Gettysburg Address stands as one of the most famous pieces of oratory in American history.
Victory celebrations
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe made a sound speech at the Galle Face Green victory celebrations; may not comparable to that of his US counterpart but gravity is no less in this belated bourgeoisie revolution in Lanka.
Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in a one-room log cabin in Hardin County, Kentucky; Lincolns formal schooling was limited to three brief periods in local schools, as he had to work constantly to support his family.
Lincoln got a job working on a river flatboat hauling freight down the Mississippi River to New Orleans. After settling in the town of New Salem, Illinois, where he worked as a shopkeeper and a postmaster, Lincoln became involved in local politics as a supporter of the Whig Party. Like his Whig heroes Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, Lincoln opposed the spread of slavery to the territories, and had a grand vision of the expanding United States, with a focus on commerce and cities rather than agriculture.
On the other hand, born on March 24, 1949 in Colombo, Ranil is the second son of Esmond Wickremesinghe and Nalini Wickremesinghe nee Wijewardene. His father was an ex-Samasamajist lawyer, who became a press baron taking over the Lake House Group of newspapers. Wickremesinghe entered the Faculty of Law at the University of Ceylon, Colombo campus. After graduation, he completed the law exams at the Sri Lanka Law College and took oaths as an advocate in 1972.
Thus Ranil Wickremesinghe has a powerful position in Lankan society compared to the then position of Abraham Lincon. Therefore Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe has no excuses; he must go forward and unite the country for progress.Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe meeting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Hyderabad House, New Delhi during his recent visit.

Vote on Account saved country from major crisis - Mangala
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera tabling the Vote on Account for the first four months of 2019 in Parliament yesterday said a new budget would be presented based on policies with new foresight.
He noted that the UNF did not have control of the government over a period of 54 days of the political crisis and if the Vote on Account was not approved, the country would have faced a dilemma where the state sector employees would not have been able to be paid and the public would have had to face untold difficulties.
The country was without a legitimate Prime Minister or government. As a result, he said the country would have been plunged into a worse economic crisis than Greece.
If by any chance, we were unable to have the Vote on Account passed prior to December 31, the whole country would have been plunged into a serious economic crisis. State sector employees would not have been able to be paid, pensions could not have been paid, Samurdhi benefits could not have been paid.
When UPFA-MP Wimal Weerawansa interrupted him, Minister Samaraweera said the illegitimate Prime Minister and government was defeated by both the Legislature and Judiciary.
Samaraweera riled Mahinda Rajapaksa by telling him, I feel sorry for you. You are someone who usually never falls for dead ropes, but this time you were taken for a serious ride and this time you did not eat a normal rope but you swallowed a cable-rope. It is saddening when something like this happens to a fellow Southerner.
He noted that the government MPs are committed to serving in the government with new vigour and commitment to bring the country out of this crisis and invited the Opposition to support the government in this endeavour.
I assure you that we wont give you dead ropes and will not let you down. We will say what we mean directly.
Samaraweera said that the government had prepared a budget for 2019 and was ready to present it when the political crisis was unleashed on October 26.
Pointing to history he said, the first Vote on Account was moved on 1931 by the Leader of the State Council, Sir D.B.Jayatilaka.
Even on previous occassions, Vote on Accounts were presented in 1995, 2002, and in 2010 to allocated moneyies for state expenses. The Vote on Account passed yesterday, allocates Rs.795 billion and Rs.965 billion for recurrent and capital expenditures respectively in addition to the allocation of Rs.5 billion for the purpose of advances.
According to Minister Samaraweera, Sri Lanka had positive economic growth during the first six months of 2018. There was a surplus in the current account. Inflation reached 0.1% in October. Foreign Reserves stood at US$8 billion. Sri Lanka had healthy international ratings and as a result the International Monetary Fund increased the support extended to Sri Lanka, he said, adding that 2017 was the best year of the Unity Government which reported highest foreign investment and the exports.
In retrospect, the Enterprise Sri lanka programme of the Unity Government has contributed to expand the economy where over Rs.50 billion has been disbursed as loans for private sector including the small and medium size enterprises.
The Government has given an interest benefit exceeding Rs.5 billion. Based on the interest rate benefit agriculture export, information technology, tourism sectors have seen turning a new leaf. As a result, the economy was widening. The Gamperialiya program developed the infrastructure at grassroots. As at October, we have had allocated Rs.20 billion for development of small irrigation projects and tanks, constructing of markets, and rural road development, explained Minister Samaraweera.
In between his Vote on Account speech, the Finance Minister added humour by riling MP Mahinda Rajapaksa. I initially though that you (MR) were innocent and had no hand in this coup, but it later struck me that you were also part of this conspiracy. At the parliament canteen, when you invited me to join you, I thought you were delusional as always. But I heard you were at the Shangri La when you have quietly slipped out and taken oath as the fake Prime Minister even without the knowledge of your wife Shranthi Rajapaksa.
On a more serious note, the Finance Minister said the government intends to present the budget for 2019 with amendments in January and the debate would run into February, before it is passed. As a responsible government, we have presented the Vote on Account to enable the smooth functioning of the government mechanism for the first four months of 2019.
Three key international credit rating agencies reduced Sri Lankas rating. The domestic interest rates went up by 0.85% increasing the debt servicing responsibilities of the Government. Rs.66.5 billion worth funds were withdrawn from our market. Sri Lankan Rupee continued to depreciate despite the 37% reduction of the global fuel prices. Regardless of the seasonal benefits, the tourism industry collapsed, said Miniter Samaraweera promising to realign the country within a short period on the development path.
It has been proposed to allocate Rs. 1,765 billion as State expenditure in the first four months of next year, out of which Rs.970 billion or 55 percent has been allocated for debt servicing, both capital and interest components. Rs.480 billion has been allocated as recurrent expenditure and Rs.310 billion as capital expenditure.
