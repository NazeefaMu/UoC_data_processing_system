CTU raps Education Ministrys career guidance fair
Ceylon Teachers Union Chairman Joseph Starline criticized the move taken by the Education Ministry which ordered principals in four provinces to make their students attend a career guidance exhibition at Kuliyapitiya.
He said the Education Ministry has issued a circular to principals of schools in the North Central, Sabaragamuwa, Central and Western provinces to send Advanced and Ordinary Level students to the career guidance exhibition.
Starline said principals were advised to bear the transportation expenses using the School Development Fund.
Students cannot gain anything from the exhibition. It is participated by a few private sector organizations, including some book publishers. Principals cannot bear the transport expenses, he said.
A five-day career guidance fair and exhibition is held at Kuliyapitiya Central College until October 7, from 9 am to 10 pm.
When the Daily News contacted Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, he said the career guidance programme is being carried out with the aim of creating awareness of the value of tertiary education.
The minister said this was the first-ever career guidance programme conducted by the Education Ministry, as the need of increasing human capital has been identified.
A large number of students are in a dilemma, especially after Advanced Levels or after dropping out of school. Even school dropouts dont have a clear idea once they finish school education.
"The exhibition will guide students to reach many goals, the minister said.

Win tour opener with conviction
England give hint of things to come
The touring England side gave a hint of what to expect in the upcoming five-match ODI series when they made a winning start to their tour with a 43-run win under the Duckworth/Lewis rain rule over Sri Lanka Board XI at the P Sara Oval yesterday.
England were well ahead in their chase for a target of 288 scoring an impressive 215-2 off 35.3 overs when bad light and rain put an end to the match.
England were set on course for their win by Joe Root and one-day captain Eoin Morgan who figured in an unbroken third wicket partnership of 174.
Both batsmen were going neck and neck towards their centuries when the game ended. Roots knock of 90 not out came off 92 balls with eight fours and Morgan struck nine fours and three sixes in his unbeaten innings of 91 off 84 balls.
England lost openers Jason Roy (27) and Jonny Bairstow (3) cheaply to be 41-2 before Root and Morgan took control.
Earlier Board XI skipper Dinesh Chandimal and Sri Lanka under 19 world cup captain Kamindu Mendis struck impressive half centuries to enable their team to reach a competitive score of 287-9 after deciding to bat first.
Chandimal who will lead Sri Lanka in the one-day series against England starting at Dambulla on October 10 hit seven fours and one six in his innings of 77 off 85 balls. Mendis coming to the wicket with the score at 128-4 hit an aggressive 61 off 72 balls (5 fours) to lead the late charge with Isuru Udana who played a cameo innings of 40 off 26 balls with three sixes and three fours.
England will take on the Board XI in another 50-over warm-up game at the same venue today. AFP

Five instances when Bangladesh lost a match off the last ball
Bangladesh lost the Asia Cup 2018 final to India off the last ball of the contest. It was the third Asia Cup final that Bangladesh failed to win. The previous two defeats came against Pakistan and India. Despite Mashrafe Mortaza and his team being heavily committed to clinching the trophy this time around, they failed due to horrible batting collapse in the final.
It was not the first instance when Bangladesh lost a match on the last ball. They were on the losing side when were defeated in the Asia Cup final against Pakistan back in 2014.
In this article, we relive five instances when Bangladesh lost an international match off the last ball.
#5 Asia Cup 2012 final against Pakistan
Despite not being a strong ODI contender, Bangladesh played excellent cricket in 2012 Asia Cup to see themselves in the final against Pakistan. They beat India and Sri Lanka to earn a place in the final.
Mushfiqur Rahim was the captain of Bangladesh during that edition of the Asia Cup. He won the toss and elected to bat first. Pakistan posted a modest total of 236 runs on the board. Bangladesh failed to chase it down.
The hosts got a steady start as Tamim Iqbal hit a half-century while opening the innings with Nazimuddin. Bangladesh short of 10 runs to win the match in last over. Aizaz Cheema came to attack and conceded only seven as Bangladesh lost the final in front of the home crowd.
#4 World T20 super 10, 2016 against India
Bangladesh's loss to India in the World T20 2016 remains as a deep wound to their fans. They hurt, even more, when the premature celebration of Mushfiqur comes to the mind.
Bangladesh won the toss in Bangalore and decided to bowl first. India scored 146 by seven wickets, and that score seemed like a chasable total for Bangladesh. But, they failed to register a historic win.
Bangladesh needed 11 runs from the last over that was bowled by Hardik Pandya. As Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur were on the wicket, Bangladesh had nothing in the mind but a win.
Mahmudullah rotated the strike in the first ball, and Mushfiqur started celebrating after smashing Pandya for the two consecutive fours. The celebration of Mushfiqur came to an end when he and Mahmudullah got dismissed on the next two deliveries of Pandya. Bangladesh needed two runs from the last ball, but Shuvagata Hom failed to accomplish that.
#3 Final game of the 2018 series against Afghanistan
After losing first two matches of three-match series against Afghanistan earlier this year, Bangladesh looked eager to avoid a shameful whitewash on the third encounter. But, they failed to skip the inevitable.
Afghanistan posted 145 on the board batting first. The Tigers failed to chase it down. They needed 30 in the last 12 balls. Mushfiqur hit Karim Janat on the 19th over for five consecutive fours, and Bangladesh needed only nine in the closing over.
Rashid Khan came to bowl the 20th over and dismissed Mushfiqur in the first delivery, subsequently, Bangladesh lost the match by one run. Ariful Haque failed to manage two from the last ball. And thus, Bangladesh whitewashed by Afghanistan for the first time in their history.
#2 Nidahas Trophy final 2018 against India
Bangladesh reached the final of Nidahas Trophy 2018, beating the hosts Sri Lanka twice. But, they finished the event as runners-up after losing the final to a tremendous effort from Dinesh Karthik.
Bangladesh posted 166 on the board, batting first at Colombo. Sabbir Rahman smashed 77 by 50 balls. India needed 34 in the last two overs. Bangladeshi players were doing nothing but waiting for their first ever trophy in a multi-national tournament.
But, the feat was written for India as Dinesh Karthik hit Rubel Hossain for 22 runs in the 19th over. India needed five from the last ball, and Dinesh Karthik finished the job, hitting Soumya Sarkar out of the park for a massive six.
#1 Asia Cup 2018 final against India
Bangladesh had a little chance this time around. They managed to score only 222 in the Asia Cup 2018 final at Dubai. Despite Liton Das scoring 121, Bangladesh's middle order was fragile to add more runs on the board. India won the toss in the final and invited Bangladesh to bat first. Bangladesh scored 222 and lost the match off the last ball. It seemed like chasing 222 could be as another day at the office for India at the halfway mark. But, Bangladeshi bowlers made things tough for Rohit Sharma and co. Brilliant captaincy of Mashrafe had kept Bangladesh's hope alive till the last ball.
India required only six from the last over. Mashrafe gave the ball to Mahmudullah Riayd, and the right-arm slow bowler made India wait till the final delivery. Yet, Kedar Jadhav's calmness ensured that India clinched the game.

Former England keeper Matt Prior: How I lost 4.5 kg in one session in a Test in Sri Lanka
England, who were the opponents against whom Sri Lanka had played their first Test in 1982, are touring the island nation for a full-fledged series and former player Matt Prior has a scary anecdote to offer on his playing experience there. The ex-wicket-keeper recently said that he had once lost 4.5 kilograms of weight in just one session during a Test match in Sri Lanka.
Prior, who played 79 Tests for England between 2007 and 2014, had toured the emerald isle in 2007 and 2012 during which he played five Tests. It was during a morning session of those Tests that Prior had lost four-and-half kilograms, giving a clear indication how much impact the heat and humidity could have on the visiting sides.
ADDED PRESSURE OF HEAT AND HUMIDITY
In one session  it was a morning session so 9.30 to 11.30  and bearing in mind I was drinking a litre of fluids every 15 minutes, I lost 4.5 kg. Thats just in a two-hour session! It is draining, quite literally. Youve got all the mental challenges of Test-match cricket  the intensity, youre playing against some fantastic cricketers, the different wickets, the spinners, everything else. But then youve got this added pressure of the heat, the humidity and how much that does physically drain you, Metro.co.uk cited talkSPORT as quoting Prior as saying.
In the 2007 series, Prior had scored two half-centuries against Sri Lanka though England lost that series 0-1. Prior, 36, will be back in Sri Lanka in November as part of the talkSPORT commentary team that will cover the Three Lions three-Test series. The two teams will also play five ODIs and one T20I before the Tests.
This is the seventh time that England are touring Sri Lanka for Test matches. The last time the visitors won a Test series in Sri Lanka was in 2000-01 when they won a three-match series 2-1. England are high on confidence as they recently thrashed India 4-1 in a home series though it will not be easy to beat Sri Lanka, who defeated South Africa in their last series, in their own backyard.  ct

Imran Tahir becomes oldest to claim an ODI hat-trick
Leg-spinner Imran Tahir became the oldest bowler ever, and just the fourth bowler for South Africa, to take an ODI hat-trick, also picking up a six-wicket haul in the process, during his side's 120-run win over Zimbabwe at Bloemfontein.
Tahir picked up the wickets of Sean Wiliams, Peter Moor and Brandon Mavuta off successive deliveries, cleaning up the Zimbabwean tail in his side's big win.
It was the 45th hat-trick in one-day cricket, making Tahir the oldest, at 39 years and 190 days, to achieve the feat. It was also the best bowling figures for South Africa against Zimbabwe in ODIs.
Tahir's was the second ODI hattrick of 2018 in international cricket, the other being by Sri Lanka's Shehan Madushanka,
who took three in three against Bangladesh in January.
Before Tahir, the record for the oldest to clinch an ODI hat-trick belonged to Zimbabwe's Eddo Brandes, who achieved the feat at the age of 33 years and 10 months, against England in 1997.
For the record, the youngest to take an ODI hat-trick is Pakistan's Aaqib Javed, who got three wickets in three balls at the age of 19 years and 81 days, against India in 1991.
Tahir also ended up becoming the second-oldest bowler to claim a fifer in ODIs, just behind Canada's Sunil Dhaniram. While Dhaniram was 39 years and 256 days when he achieved the feat, Tahir fell short of the record by around 60 days.
He also became the first South African to take more than six wickets in an ODI twice. Ahead of the game, Tahir, who recorded the third ODI five-wicket haul of his career, had said that he was 'loving the game at the moment'.
"It's a bit early for me to say anything about retirement. I'm loving the game at the moment. One thing I can say, if we win the World Cup then I'll definitely probably call it," he had said.
Tahir ended with figures of 6-1-24-6, as Zimbabwe failed to chase down 199, folding for 78 in 24 overs. - sk

Issues to assess
Obviously there are two ways to think of the environment. Firstly the attitude of the poor who is demanding from the surrounding without thinking of the damage done. The other is the civilized with a consciousness about the survival of the environment. This doesnt mean theres only one way to divide the attitude of humans to the environment.
There are in fact countless ways of understanding and engaging with the world around us. In the entire history humans, spread throughout the world, many ways humans reacted with the environmental cake, so to speak: according to the needs of the moment, envisaged futures, later give rise to cultural habits, practices, philosophical frameworks and theories of being etc.
We need not go into all that here. What needs to be done is to examine the extremism with respect to the environment. We must apply the Buddhas middle path theory; to speaking there are two kinds of extremism. One could characterize them as follows.
Theres the idealistic school that believe that humans at the centre of creation - sees everything outside the species as dispensable or as having potential to serve human interests. Human here needs to be fleshed out a bit; many things are done in the name of entirety but in this class divided society they serve the interests of one or few and usually a particular category of people; in the modern world the international bourgeoisie.
Social and human rights
Theories are constructed to justify carefully, suppressing or footnoting the uncomfortable. For example, the term professionals is used and so too intellectuals to cover up exploitation and plunder. Throw those out and we get neat equations giving us the exact happenings within the systems. Sure, pressure from social and human rights critiques have forced such theories to be refined, but they are not fooling too many people.
Justification comes in the form of modernism and high rise development that are aggressively marketed. The slums and dirt of the present are used as shameful crimes and goodies called progress and development are swung like carrots in front of the impoverished. The entire story or the conspiracy is not told. Not all costs are talked about. Displacement, compensation and loss of community are not assessed. Instead we are sold grand plans and mysterious projects. And if anyone dares talk about uncomfortable truths such as global warming or climate change then the entire discourse is shifted to scientific exchange of views from engineers and scientists where those with connections cash and power get to commissions and thereafter everything is resolved by market value-free truths supposedly obtained scientifically. Its all in the name of The People and modernist progress. According to the Buddha modernism will accompany the negation conservatism. There are those at the other extreme who sometimes operate as though human beings should not disturb the natural process at all.
They protest, of course democracy allow that but without violence and bloodshed. Then they go to courts and get rulings prohibiting actions and they talk of dire consequences. They too, finally agree to development that bring in the future but with a plan to preserve the environment.
Human beings have always exploited the world around them. In fact no creature is self-contained. While other creatures are dependent on nature, humans have exploited the environment. The trick is to figure out a mode of engagement that is wholesome, so that humans contain the totality of the planet intact; something that of course detracts by the very fact of engagement but at the same time consciously supports regeneration.
Environmental concerns
There are people who argue, forcefully with commitment, that a certain degree of economic prosperity is necessary before a nation can shift to a green economy. A country like Sri Lanka, even if it retired environmental concerns for the next decade, cannot impact the global environment in any significant way. Lets ignore for now the story of Maha Parakrama Bahu that he wanted all little drops of water in Lanka to be collected to be used in agricultural projects before let go to sea. On the other hand there are modernist who argue that if development is dumped in favour of environment, the price will have to be paid by the poor and this will invariably transform into environmental costs that are worse. If not at best, expenditure will be pretty much the same. These arguments are articulated in discussions on a wide range of subjects, especially when it comes to energy, waste disposal, industries and agriculture. Costs, benefits, renew-ability and recovery rates feature significantly in the debates.
Lost in all this is an overall framework of what development truly means. Where are we heading or rather what kind of destination would we like to walk towards Can we go to new Parakum Yugaya Is that the real green apex What are the costs we are willing to pay What kind of benefit-package would we be satisfied with What are the parameters and who gets to decide and impose them Theres no bottom line. Well, there is, but its flexible. It has to contain the health of the planet not just the beloved Lanka, the health of the people currently alive and those who are yet to come.
We need to talk about decent, healthy and environment-friendly lifestyles. Above all we need to revisit the discourse of freedom and limitations of the same and integration of nationalities with self determination. We have to recognize the right of the other, which is politics, (and therefore power) is part of the story. We must devise strategies that consider such factors instead of meekly submitting to them or pretending they dont exist. We have to factor in the reality of corruption. There are loopholes and theres bulldozing through barricades. We cannot legislate against all these, but we can find different ways of empowering rational, civilized and responsible governance.
This is the only planet we have. This is the only life each of us has. Life would include concerns and aspirations, not just for yourself but for friends, families, nationalities and larger collectives we identify with. All this is part of the story.

Jadeja and bowlers put India in command
RAJKOT Friday: Indian bowlers rattled the West Indies first-innings reply after Ravindra Jadeja smashed his maiden international century as the hosts got a firm grip over the first Test on Friday.
The tourists were tottering at 94 for six at stumps, trailing India by 555 runs in their first innings on day two in Rajkot. Roston Chase, on 27, and Keemo Paul, on 13, were batting at close of play.
But it was the Indian batting that made the worlds top side so dominant as they posted their highest total against the West Indies after declaring on 649-9 at tea. Skipper Virat Kohli hit a landmark ton, top-scoring with 139.
Fast bowler Mohammed Shami then struck early to get the two West Indian openers back in the pavilion for seven runs including stand-in-skipper Kraigg Brathwaite for two.
But Jadeja remained the star of the day after making an unbeaten 100. The left-handed batsman stuck around with the lower-order to demolish a toothless West Indian attack.
Obviously after nine years of international cricket I am scoring a hundred, so it is a special moment, Jadeja, who made his international debut in 2009 and played his first Test in 2012, said.
Whenever I reached 70-80 in the past I thought about my hundred, but threw my wicket away. I have made big hundreds in the domestic circuit, so I thought I can get hundreds in the international level too. Jadeja -- playing his 38th Test -- also got a wicket after sending back Sunil Ambris, who had scored 114 not out in his sides only tour game last week, for 12.
The all-rounder though had a near-miss moment on the field when he playfully waited to run out Shimron Hetmyer who was scampering back to reach the non-strikers end.
Jadeja though hit the stumps with the batsman well short of the crease but his teasing act tested the nerves of the Indian fielders including Kohli.
Both batsmen were at the same end, so I thought I could easily hit the stumps. I was just walking at the stumps, and I didnt think he (Hetmyer) will start running, jadeja said with a smile.
I cant think what would have happened if I hadnt hit the stumps, but then I threw it and luckily it hit the stumps. Kohli behind BradmanEarlier Kohli became the quickest batsman to reach 24 Test centuries since the great Donald Bradman in the morning session.
Kohli put together 133 runs for the fifth wicket with overnight partner Rishabh Pant, who made a quickfire 92. Kohli, who started on his overnight score of 72, got to his hundred in his 123rd innings with a boundary off leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo. Bradman took just 66 innings to achieve the same feat. AFP

Lalith, Anusha appeal fixed for October 12
Two appeal petitions, filed by former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita, challenging the judgement of the Colombo High Court, were yesterday fixed for October 12 by the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal Two-Judge-Bench comprising Justice Deepali Wijesundara and Justice Achala Wengappuli issued an order directing the Registrar of the Colombo High Court that case proceedings pertaining to the High Court trial be produced before the Court of Appeal on the next inquiry date.
Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita had been sentenced to a three-year-rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to the TRC.
On September 7 last year, Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita were found guilty of misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to the TRC over the controversial sil redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe sil) distribution case.
Through their appeal applications, the two accused-appellants stated that they were seeking the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to review and set aside their conviction imposed by the High Court dated September 7, 2018.
In their petitions, the accused-appellants stated that neither a sum of Rs. 600 million nor a part of it were utilised by them for their personal gains. They further stated that the High Court judge had given them a short period (13 days) to pay off compensations.
While handing out a lengthy judgement, High Court judge Gihan Kulatunga had maintained that the prosecutors have proven the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt.
The High Court judge further maintained that the accused had committed this offence dishonestly with the intention of gaining undue advantage to a particular candidate during the 2015-Presidential Election. While observing a political motivation had led the accused to commit this offence, Lalith Weeratunge and Anusha Palpita were ordered to pay a compensation of Rs. 50 million each to the TRC in lieu of losses incurred contrary to the Telecommunication Act.
Each accused was further ordered to pay a fine of Rs. two million and, in default of the payment of the fine, they will have to serve an additional one years imprisonment.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita under three counts, in connection with a criminal misappropriation of Rs.600 million belonging to the TRC funds during the 2015-Presidential Election campaign. They were found guilty of all charges.
Counsel Kanchana Ratwatte with J. Ratnayake appeared for the appellant accused. Senior State Counsel Jayalakshi Silva appeared for the Attorney General.

Lankan younguns outgun Afghans
Sri Lankas young guns did what their seniors failed to do when they defeated Afghanistan by 31 runs in the semi-finals of the ACC Under 19 Asia Cup at Dhaka yesterday and qualify for the final with India.
Sri Lankas victory was largely due to an excellent century from former St Sebastians College Moratuwa right-hander Nawanidu Fernando whose innings of 111 off 129 balls was the cornerstone on which they built their total of 209-7 in 50 overs.
Afghanistan who got off to a good start being 84-1 at one stage collapsed to 178 all out in 48.3 overs to the left-arm orthodox spin of former St Servatius College, Matara cricketer Shashika Dulshan who ended up with figures of 4 for 24.
Sri Lanka got off to one of their worst starts when both openers were dismissed without scoring to be 0-2 in the second over. They lost half the side for 99 before Fernando joined by skipper Nipun Dananjaya (27) rescued the side with a face-saving 67-run stand for the sixth wicket.
Sri Lanka will meet India in the final at Dhaka on Sunday.
Scores: Sri Lanka (U19) 209-7 in 50 overs (Nawanidu Fernando 111, Kalana Perera 22, Nipun Dananjaya 27, Pasindu Sooriyabandara 19 n.o., Abdul Rahman 3/42)

Patients with mental illnesses on the rise
The number of Sri Lankans suffering from depression will significantly increase by 2030, Mental Health Unit Director Dr. Chithramali de Silva said.
She was addressing a health seminar at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo to mark the World Mental Health Day on October 10. She said at present, 20 percent of the young generation suffers from some sort of mental problem.
Depression has become a common mental problem among children. Children commit suicide due to depression. The third cause for deaths among children between 15 and 19 years is suicide.
Dr. de Silva said a total of 19 percent of the children suffer from loneliness. Six percent of the children suffer due to not having a good friend. Childrens brain develops until they reach 25 years and until then they cannot make wise decisions.
Using electronic gadgets from childhood is one of the main reasons for developing mental problems among children. Parents should pay special attention if children below 17 years prefer to be alone, she said.
Unhealthy lifestyles and education system of children should change. If a child suffers from a headache for a long time, muscle pain, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, lack of enthusiasm to attend school etc., parents should take immediate action to obtain treatment for their children, she added.

Project to develop Hambantota
President Maithripala Sirisena has given instructions to authorities to implement a special project to identify problems of the rural community in Hambantota and to provide solutions while developing rural infrastructure facilities.
The President gave these instructions during a meeting at the Presidential Secretariat on Thursday, on preparing a programme to address the basic problems of low income families in the Hambantota district.
Even though during the recent past, a large number of mega development projects were carried out in the district, many living in rural areas do not even have basic facilities. President Sirisena stressed the need of an urgent programme to uplift their lives.
Issues in providing drinking water to the people in the district, providing solutions for land issues to enable chena farmers to take up a permanent cultivation process, providing solutions to the water problem and providing long term solutions to the issue of wild elephant threats were also discussed.
The President said public officers should pay attention to rectify the low living conditions of people. The President said field officers have been deployed in rural areas and it is their responsibility to apprise relevant sectors on the difficulties faced by the people.
President Sirisena said the subsidies granted by the government to the people are sufficient. However, the problem is that those subsidies were not properly distributed among the public.
The President stressed the importance of moving forward while solving these issues.
Attention was paid to the drinking water issue in the Hambantota district. Implementing a water supply project which produces 35,000 cubic meters per day using the Lunugamvehera Reservoir proposed by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board was also discussed.
Furthermore, the President stressed the need for taking urgent action to provide solutions to the drinking water issue in Kataragama.
Ministry Secretaries, including Secretary to the President Udaya R. Seneviratne, District Secretary M. K.Bandula Harischandra and other officials participated.

Relative Merits
Nepotism has been part and parcel of this country's political culture since the dawn of Independence. It is said that Prime Minister D. S. Senanayake wanted to ensure that his son Dudley became Prime Minister on his demise with the approval of the then Governor. This saga was graphically described in the memoirs of Dr. M.M.C. Kaleel, a contemporary of D.S. This episode, among others, led to the exit of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike from the UNP to form the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) which swept to power in 1956.
It is unfair to suggest that S.W.R.D. also intended to make a similar move. To begin with, his offspring were still in their school-going age when he was PM. However, what followed after him was a study in nepotism in the SLFP which was one of the chief reasons for the party's ignominious defeat in 1977.
Nepotism has now grown to monstrous proportions and seeped down to the lower rungs of politics. According to a media report, of all the Secretaries to Ministries, including Provincial Ministries, over 75 percent constitute the wives, children and relatives of the ministers.
The report quotes the Ministry Secretaries Union General Secretary Ajith Jayasundera as saying that as a result there was not even one individual competent enough to tender the correct advise to these ministers, deputy ministers, state ministers and provincial ministers that would benefit the country. All this is because the ministers have appointed their family members or relatives as their secretaries, he stressed.
It appears that our ministries too have become an employment agency like our Foreign Service, which has been known to be a haven for the kith and kin of politicians. We saw how the Foreign Service was made a playground of sorts by Mahinda Rajapaksas relatives and cronies. A tea-taster cousin of the former President who was made Ambassador to the USA is today a fugitive from justice and another relative who helmed the equivalent desk in Russia is also on the run. Both these individuals who were supposed to work for the benefit of the State, on the contrary, have left in their wake a string of liabilities running into several millions of rupees. Similarly, the relatives of ministers holding the job of secretaries have only become liabilities to the State rather than contributing anything of substance.
Of course one cannot apply this argument across the board. There could be family members of ministers who are actually capable of handling the tasks entrusted to them with aplomb. Dudley Senanayake turned out to be one of the best Prime Ministers Sri Lanka ever had. One could also say that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was well chosen by his brother Mahinda to be the Defence Secretary during the conflict period. The same though could not be said of MR's appointment of his brother-in- law to head the national carrier which was consigned to a financial black hole. Mahinda Rajapaksa recently announced the intention to field his eldest son at probably the 2025 Presidential poll - another reminder of his dynastic ambitions and apparent inability to think outside the immediate family circle.
All Governments in the past were guilty of this practice. One recalls the hue and cry made by the Opposition whenever the Ministers of the Government in power appointed their relatives to various posts. However in Sri Lanka, when the boot was on the other foot the accusers themselves resorted to the practice. The salaries of the relatives paid for by the tax payer went on to swell the family income.
In other words, the ministers were receiving a bloated income thanks to their secretarial wives and daughters. No wonder the Associations General Secretary has voiced his bitterness. If at all relatives needed to be given a paying job in the Government, they should be kept out of positions that could influence the decisions of Ministers.
There was recently a Finance Ministry regulation that made it mandatory for the head of department of a State sector organisation to pay the salaries of excess staff in his/her department out of his/her own pocket. This was to discourage the recruitment of supporters of politicians as unproductive labour in State institutions. Similarly, ministers, deputy ministers and provincial ministers too should be brought under this circular, if indeed the secretaries to their ministries are mere time-servers who owe their jobs to their kinship with the minister.
We have today the sons, daughters and wives of ministers and MPs holding membership of Provincial Councils that for them are the finishing schools to enter Parliament when their papas and mamas hang up their boots or while still in harness. Now we have family members, in addition, employed as Secretaries to the parents who are Government ministers. Unsurprisingly, there is a stampede by politicians to enter Parliament and other political bodies.
While we cannot stop a son following his fathers political footsteps in a democracy, political parties must make a more honest effort to find fresh faces including women professionals who have no previous political association or link, to make politics more inclusive.

Richmond re-obtains land to construct playground
The land belonging to Richmond College, Galle, allocated for the construction of Ocean University, was handed over to Richmond College again by Science, Technology and Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama on the request of Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena.Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena was addressing the media yesterday.
He said there were over 80,000 children living in Galle and suburban areas and around 250,000 children in the entire Galle district. The main problem faced by them in addition to the students of Richmond College, was the lack of a playground.
When everything was ready to construct a playground in Kaduruduwa by Richmond College, the land was taken over for the Ocean University in 2017.
Even though we opposed it, our request was neglected. Then, the problem was discussed with Vocational Training Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama and he promised to solve the matter.

SC rejects Ven. Gnanasara Theras appeal; affirms CA Judgement
The Supreme Court yesterday upheld the Court of Appeal judgment that found Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera guilty over his contemptuous behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrates Court on January 25, 2016.
Accordingly, a majority of a divided three-judge-Supreme Court Bench decided to refuse special leave to appeal application filed by Gnanasara Thera who sought an order to set aside the judgement of Court of Appeal dated August 8, 2018.
The Supreme Court Bench comprised Justice Eva Wanasundera, Justice Nalin Perera and Justice Prasanna Jayawardena.
On August 8 this year, Ven. Gnanasara Thera was sentenced to 19-years-Rigorous Imprisonment to be served concurrently within six years by the Court of Appeal over his contemptuous behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrates Court.
Expressing his views regarding the special leave to appeal application, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena observed that The Supreme Court is bound to maintain the dignity of the courts and further observed that both the Supreme Court and Appeal Court have unlimited jurisdiction to deal with the contempt of court matters.
Through his special leave to appeal application, Ven. Gnanasara Thera further sought an order to release him on bail pending the final hearing and determination of this special leave to appeal.
At a previous occasion, Court of Appeal (President) Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne refused to grant leave to appeal citing there is no substantial reason to consider the application.
Ven. Gnanasara Thera was sentenced to four-years-Rigorous Imprisonment in respect of the first count. Another four-years-Rigorous Imprisonment was imposed regarding the second count. Six-years and five-years Rigorous Imprisonments were also imposed in respect of third and fourth counts respectively.
Ven. Gnanasara Thera stated that the Court of Appeal erred in law by dealing with the complaint made by the Magistrate under Article 105(3) of the Constitution, when Section 55(1) of the Judicature Act No.2 of 1978 provide a special jurisdiction to the Magistrates Court to take cognisance and to punish for contempt committed in the presence of Court itself.
The petitioner stated that the Court of Appeal erred in fact and law in convicting the Petitioner for counts 2,3 and 4 of the charge sheet when the evidence presented by the prosecution did not establish the said counts beyond reasonable doubt.
The petitioner further stated that the judges of the Court of Appeal misdirected themselves in law by failing to appreciate that it is not lawful to prefer four counts of contempt of court based on different parts of one single incident that took place before the Magistrate and having sentences passed in respect of each such part.
He further said the judges of Court of Appeal, misdirected themselves in law by failing to appreciate that the sentences imposed in this case are far too excessive having regard to the decision in the case of S.C. (Rule) 01/2004, where a Bench of five judges of the Supreme Court imposed a sentence of two-years Rigorous Imprisonment for contempt of the Supreme Court committed for the second time after having issued a severe warning on the first occasion;
While handing out a 56-page judgment, Court of Appeal Justice (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne had observed that the ingredients of all four charges framed against the accused have been proved beyond reasonable doubt.
At a previous occasion,Ven. Gnanasara Thera had been sentenced to six-months Rigorous Imprisonment after he was found guilty for threatening and intimidating Sandhya Eknaligoda, the wife of missing journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda.
Presidents Counsel Rienzie Arsekularatne with Counsel Udara Muhamdiramge and Namal Karunaratne appeared for Ven. Gnasara Thera. Senior Deputy Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysuriya with State Counsel Malik Azis appeared for the Attorney General.

From school in England to world stage  Prithvi Shaw
Shaw, 18, reached his hundred off just 99 balls to surpass the record of Abbas Ali Baig.
The opener is also the fourth youngest player of all time to hit a debut ton and the second youngest Indian to make a Test century after Sachin Tendulkar. He eventually fell for 134, including 19 fours, as India closed on 364-4.
Shaws success on his international debut is no surprise to former England bowler Lucy Pearson, who was head of Cheadle Hulme School when Shaw came over to play for the school near Manchester in 2012.
He was just stellar from the outset - you can see a lot of quality cricketers at schoolboy and schoolgirl level but he really was a world apart, she told BBC Sport.
Aged only 12, Shaw was put straight into the first team, scoring 1,446 runs during his three-month stay, despite also having to adapt to the climate and the cuisine.
He constantly looked like a mini Michelin man because he wore as many jumpers as he could possibly put on, said Pearson.
The food was beyond tasteless for him - he couldnt understand what was the point of a jacket potato.
She added that first-team schoolboy players saw Shaw arrive wearing four jumpers, complaining about the food, smiling sweetly at people and thought theyd get him out no problem.
But then he started to bat.
HE WILL BE A FORCED TO BE RECKONED WITH
For Pearson, who played 12 Tests, 62 ODIs and the inaugural womens Twenty20 international for England, what marked Shaw out was as much his resilient personality as his phenomenal ability.
Shaw, whose mother died when he was four, dedicated his maiden Test ton to his father, who would travel two and a half hours to take Shaw to training in Mumbai from their home in Virar.
He had a real maturity for a young lad but he was also incredibly warm, good-humoured and quite cheeky, said Pearson.
He has very strong values, he is ambitious, tenacious and he will certainly be a force to be reckoned with over the years. This no surprise - we knew he was going to play for India one day.
She added Shaw had forged very good relationships with the family he stayed with, the staff and his school team-mates because he is a really genuine, humble, affable young man.
Shaw, who was the first Indian cricketer to join Cheadle Hulme School on a partnership scheme set up by Samir Pathak and John Wilson, returned to play club cricket in England the next two years after his initial stay, also hitting a record 546 in a Harris Shield match back in India in 2013.
Some of Shaws school friends met up with him when he was an unused member of the India Test squad this summer and Pearson said her only regret is she did not get to see him score his debut century in England.
But he will be back and scoring runs - sadly - against England in the years to come, she added. If hes playing, I will definitely be finding a ticket.
CONTINUE BATTING FEARLESSLY
Baig was 20 years 131 days old when he made a century on his debut against England at Old Trafford in 1959, with Shaw 18 years 329 days old.
All-time leading Test run scorer Tendulkar, to whom Shaw has been compared, was 17 years 112 days old when he hit his first Test century against England at Old Trafford in 1990 - on his ninth Test appearance.
Tendulkar said it lovely to see such an attacking knock and told Shaw to continue batting fearlessly.
India head coach Ravi Shastri said it was a free and fearless performance on debut and that there was a bit of Viru and the Master there referring to former opener Virender Sehwag and Tendulkar.
Shaw said he was nervous at first but grew in confidence after he started hitting boundaries early on.
I wanted to dominate them as much as I could - I like dominating the bowlers and I was trying that by waiting for the loose balls and they bowled many boundary balls, he said.
Bangladesh batsman Mohammad Ashraful is the youngest debut Test centurion, with Zimbabwes Hamilton Masakadza and Pakistans Salim Malik the other two players to achieve the feat at a younger age than Shaw.

Second leg of water polo encounter to decide RL Hayman trophy
In an act of exemplary sportsmanship Royal College has decided to forfeit the result of their first leg win over S. Thomas College in their water polo encounter for the RL Hayman trophy played last Saturday at the Sugathadasa Sports Complex.
The Royal College principal BA Abeyratne in a letter addressed to acting warden of S. Thomas College Mt Lavinia Asanka S Perera has stated that even there is no official request from the governing bodies for Royal to forfeit the points obtained in the first leg encounter, keeping up with the spirit of the game we agree to your request that the winners of the Hayman trophy to be the result of the second leg.
The second leg is scheduled to take place at the same venue today.
Controversy rose at the end of the first leg which Royal won narrowly 9-8 when it was found after the match that they had fielded an extra player in the pool. This evidence came to light only after viewing a video play of the match.
The Sri Lanka Aquatic Sports Union (SLASU) the governing body for water sports clarifying the position states in a letter to the Royal College principal:
1) The extra player was in the pool for 1 minute and 45 seconds of the playing time. We note that the Royal College goalie who joins the team from outside the pool after the time out called by S Thomas team has been missed out.
2) This error has not been picked up by the referees or the officials.
We are of the view that this was a genuine oversight by the officials and the coaching staff. According to the FINA rules SLASU should receive the protest within  hour after the particular match. I would also like to mention that the two referees were appointed on the request of the joint organizing committee.

Specialist doctor was inebriated, Police confirm
Traffic Police DIG Ajith Rohana confirmed that the woman specialist doctor, involved in an accident in Boralesgamuwa in which an IP was killed, was confirmed to be under the influence of liquor at the time of the accident.
He said that the police had conducted the breathalyser test following the accident and the test confirmed that she was above the permitted limit. More than 80ml of alcohol was found to be in her blood stream during the breathalyser test.
The doctor had attended a party prior to the accident. We sent a police team to obtain CCTV footage of the party and have recorded statements from persons who attended the party, the DIG said
He said according to two previous Supreme Court rulings, court had ruled that only a breathalyser test or a blood test conducted in a laboratory within a stipulated time can confirm whether an individual was under the influence of liquor or not. Court will not accept a doctors observations based on whether the persons breath smelled of alcohol or not, he said.At the time of the accident, the doctor was given a breathalyser test and it had turned green. Just because a doctor says that there was no smell of alcohol on her breath, it is not valid evidence in court.
It can be produced as verbal evidence but it is not solid evidence. In that case this doctor should have conducted a blood test at the time. The law says that if someone is to produce expert evidence, it should be explained how they arrived at that conclusion, he said. The test conducted by the police was solid evidence as to the condition of the doctor at the time of the accident.
A police officer (IP) attached to the Police Field Force Headquarters was killed in this accident and his wife and two children were injured in the head-on collision which took place on September 30 in Boralesgamuwa.
The doctor was arrested over the accident and remanded until October 9. DIG Ajith Rohana said she is currently receiving treatment at the Colombo South Teaching Hospital under prison custody.

Towards a quality Police Service
When I see the headlines of most of todays (03/10/2018) leading newspapers, I feel very sad and disgusted, about the plight of the Police whose reputation has taken a beating recently. When we joined the police, as young Sub-Inspectors, in the early 70s it was with so much pride and hope, we joined this very elite organisation which was respected by the society.
The British had really brought so much discipline and command into the system that encouraged youngsters especially outstanding sportsman in that era, from respectable family backgrounds, to join as officers. Only a very limited number of personnel were taken. But due to various factors including terrorism, insurgency and political influence, there was a transformation in the Police. Various governments made attempts to revitalize the Police, but none of them was able to resurrect this most important Government establishment which has deteriorated from top to bottom.
Today the IGP has been identified as a joker. This is not the kind of certificate one would associate with the Police. It is so sad how this situation has deteriorated to this abysmal level. We as Sub-Inspectors at one time were so proud to wear the uniform and we were respected at all forums. I still remember as young officers how our seniors, conducted themselves in courts with leading lawyers and came out with flying colours and how they tackled some of the brilliant cases.
There was no assistance from the Attorney Generals Department and various other associations. These Inspectors, HQIs prepared meticulously for court dates, getting up very early in the morning about 4.00 a.m. to prepare their notes. It was amazing to witness. Since it is unfair to mention names, there were officers who were better than any Presidents Counsellors at that time. The Kirambakanda case, Turf Club robbery, Matthew Peiris case and many other cases can be quoted. But, there again it is not fair to pick a few.
Strength to the people
Where did we go wrong is the question. When the Head of the Department is unable to hold onto his position and the status that he supposed to maintain, having a Police Commission or Constitutional Council is of no use. It is quality leadership that can produce results. It is a pity the people in command has not realized and identified how we defeated the most brutal terrorist organisation in the world.
This was possible purely because there was no political interference where operations were concerned. It was the task of the professionals to decide and handle situations and today it is not so. You can see how politicians are protecting the culprits - it is obvious when you follow a news conference. Why cant the Police make use of that experience to strengthen the society, law & order, security and give strength to the people of this country with correct people occupying the correct positions
Get experts to train the police and other specialized units like STF, Narcotics and Criminal Intelligence Units. Surely the diplomatic missions will come forward to assist in the same way they did in the past to strengthen the STF, NIB etc.
Although I do not wish to pick any former IGP specifically, since I had the privilege of directly working under some of the respected IGPs like Stanley Senanayake, Ana Seneviratne, Rudra Rajasingham and Cyril Herath, I learnt what leadership is.
Political leadership
I studied how they handled various difficult situations, challenges, and upheld the position of the IGP. It is true you need the support of the political leadership, but they knew that they were professionals and also needed their professional knowledge and experience for the politicians to strengthen their position.
Thus they never made any decision that would affect the Police department in the long run.
Ana Seneviratne was once told by the President at that time to remove an OIC from Nuwara Eliya district (Ragala) as the Minister in charge of the district was very angry since he has assaulted one of his Junior Politicians. The President implied that he would not be able to work in that district. The IG did immediately remove him from that station, which was an E grade station, only to post him to an A3 station which is a higher rank.
As for Cyril Herath, when the Political leadership wanted an officer promoted as a policy he did not agree because he had a valid reason and refused to do so. Since the political leadership insisted that he should promote their nominee, the IG tendered his resignation. That was the quality of the officers we served under.
We never had IGPs using slang language in public or singing and dancing on the stage in uniform. If we knew that this was the future standard of the police I do not think many of us would have ever thought of joining the Police service.
There are so many things that the police can do especially to strengthen the community, ensure harmony in society and win the confidence of the people even at this late stage.
We need somebody with vision to carefully analyze what really went wrong for the department to go down to these depths, because discipline is the key factor to produce results.
I only hope there will be a day police officers once again earn respect like in the olden days by the society as the guardians of the nation.

US delegation here to promote investment
Executive Vice President of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) David Bohigian and other U.S. government officials visited Sri Lanka from October 3 to 5 to promote U.S. investment in the region and strengthen cooperation with regional allies to drive economic growth and stability.
The delegation met Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera and representatives of American businesses active in the Sri Lankan market.
The United States seeks to build strong, reciprocal, and balanced bilateral trade and investment relationships throughout the Indo-Pacific, said Charg d'affaires Robert Hilton.
We work with the Sri Lankan government to ensure that American companies are given the opportunity to compete for government tenders and that tenders are conducted fairly and free from corruption.
He added, The United States is the single largest export market for Made in Sri Lanka garments. We would like to grow U.S. exports to Sri Lanka, from agricultural products to manufactured goods to software and entertainment.
OPIC has a long history of partnering with allies in the region and recently signed Memoranda of Understanding with Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI), and with Australias Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
Positioned within reach of one of the worlds busiest trade routes, Sri Lanka is a hub of maritime activity in the Indian Ocean and serves a vital role in the global economy, said Bohigian.
Investments backed by the U.S. government provide a financially-sound alternative to state-led solutions that lead nations like Sri Lanka into debt traps. OPIC is committed to supporting projects that promote free and open societies while adhering to strong environmental and labor standards. We look forward to partnering with Sri Lanka and other regional allies to identify opportunities for investment in ports and other infrastructure, which will fuel sustainable economic growth, create jobs, and leave countries better off.
Historically, OPIC has invested $118 million in Sri Lanka and currently has almost $20 million invested across four projects.
OPIC is the U.S. governments development finance institution. As part of his National Security Strategy, President Donald Trump highlighted the need for a modernized approach by the U.S. government to development finance to help grow aspiring partners, promote economic relationships, and increase investment in regions important to American interests.

Warne backs Bodyline skipper, slams Waugh
Sydney, Friday: Australian great Shane Warne has endorsed one of the most controversial figures in cricketing history, while also renewing his decades-old feud with former captain Steve Waugh.
Warne, Test crickets second-most prolific wicket-taker with 708 scalps, revealed his admiration for Douglas Jardine, who led Englands Bodyline tour, in his new book No Spin published this week.
Warne said he believed Jardine was among the best captains ever to have played the game.
Douglas Jardine, of course, for what he achieved against Bradman and having the courage to change the games parameters, Warne wrote.
Jardine, an upper class Englishman, is generally regarded as a villain in Australian cricketing circles.
His tactics of instructing fast bowlers, led by Harold Larwood, to aim at batsmens bodies -- in a bid to curb run machine Donald Bradman -- provoked anger amongst the host nation at the time.
Jardines tactics worked and England won the series 4-1 but Australians regarded it as unsporting and it strained relations between London and Canberra.
He was mercilessly hounded by Sydney crowds, including a famous taunt leave those flies alone Jardine, theyre the only friends youve got.
But Warne, who called for Australia to use Bodyline fast-ball tactics against England last year, backed the captain.
He also criticised his former captain Steve Waugh in his book, calling him selfish.
Warne said he was disappointed when Waugh dropped him in the fourth Test in Antigua in the West Indies in 1999.
I lost a bit of respect for him after that. I believe he should have backed me -- as I always believe the art of captaincy is to support your players and back them every time.
This gains the respect from the players and makes them play for you. He didnt, its history, but I never found it easy with him after that.
He accused Waugh if being more focused on his average than the teams result.
Steve Waugh was the most selfish player I ever played with and was only worried about averaging 50, he added.
It was about a lack of loyalty. Pretty childish, I know, but thats the way it was.

He commended the Finance Ministry decision to restrict vehicle imports and some other non-essential items. Samarasinghe said that the Finance Ministry has taken this decision to ease the pressure on the Rupee. Public and government officers also have been using their permits which have been issued. But there are more awaiting to obtain permits.
When a decision is taken, you have to make it applicable to all. So whether politicians have taken their vehicle permits or not, when you announce a policy decision like that, it must be applicable to everyone, the Minister said.

What if cricket had four stumps instead of three
This might sound outrageously insane and nonsensical but it kind of makes sense in a cricketing world dominated by batsmen. Ever since cricket started gaining main-stream popularity in terms of the revenues it started generating, we have seen a major decline in the quality of cricket that is sometimes celebrated.
The idea of having four stumps was actualised by former New Zealand cricketer Martin Crowe in Cricket Max. The idea seems really baseless, but its just another opinion on how bowlers can be given justice in this game where batsmen take all the credit and fun.
In a world that celebrates cricket with their favourite batsmen going for the big shots and hitting runs all around the stadium, we have failed to appreciate the bowlers who are also in the same profession.
The very idea that seems to have resided in the minds of every individual that high-scoring games are interesting has crept up the ladder into becoming a common misconception about the game. Batsmen are enjoying all kinds of advantages over the bowlers and this just doesnt stop at the popularity and revenues they snatch from multinational companies in an extra income that is bestowed upon them. But the very idea that batting equipment is getting smarter and better with the grounds only getting smaller per year, it causes a great problem for the game which has now become a spectacle to see the ball out of the stadium all the time.
There is batting powerplay to enable more runs and lighter bats which strong finish to ensure hard-hitting sixes. Bowlers, on the other hand, have remained to be the real hard workers of the game, trying to get the wicket in whichever way they can. Even if this means, getting hit for a couple of sixes to lure the batsmen into getting caught by the fielder. Its the bowlers who have learned to play the mental game behind cricket into stopping a batsman from scoring, all the while batsmen enjoy a great time waiting for the next ball to hit it out of the ground.
What if cricket had four stumps The idea is very simple even if it sounds outrageously insane today. Four stumps ensures that the bowler has a wicket to target and that batsmen cannot block all the balls with his pads or with the bat right in front.

No interference in BoI investment project approval process
Acting Board of Investment (BoI) Chairman Mangala Yapa yesterday assured that there is no political interference in the approval process of investment projects.
Unlike in the past, investment proposals do not go through any non routine channels and all the proposals come to the BOI, he added.
He was responding to the recent media reports which gave false information on the project to set-up a high speed production plant.
The Acting Chairman said that the BOI deals with all investment projects in a professional and transparent manner.
Explaining the BoIs investment proposal appraisal process of the BoI, the Acting Chairman said that once a proposal was submitted to the BoI, they do the initial screening and if it is within their terms of references, they can make a decision on that.
But there are complex projects that the BoI could not take decisions and those project proposals will be forwarded to the Single Window Investment Approval Committee (SWIAC).
The committee has the authority to invite other public authorities who are relevant to the project. It is a holistic screening of the project at the beginning, he said.
The SWIAC was set up in December 2016 to evaluate and approve large scale investments and fast track approval.
The SWIAC which is chaired by the Treasury Secretary R.S.H.Samaratunga consist of the Economic Advisor to the President S. Rajapathirana, Senior Advisor to the Prime Minister R.Paskerlingam, BoI Chairman Dumindra Rathnayake, Tourism Development Authority Chairman Kavan Ratnayaka, BOI Board Member and Technical Advisor to the Minister of Internal Trade Mangala Yapa, Senior Corporate Sector Ajith Gunawardane and BoI Director General Duminda Ariyasinghe.
This committee has met 31 times since then depending on the availability of project committees are summoned. Almost 54 projects were discussed and approval was given to start 26 projects.
Five of these projects have been deferred due to various reasons including insufficient information provided, or issues relating to policy decisions.
If a project is differed that does not mean that the project is thrown to the dustbin. There are few projects that have been rejected.
It goes through a due process.
BOI Director General Duminda Ariyasinghe said that the High Speed Railway Project in question is one of the five of deferred projects where the investor had submitted incomplete information.
It has been submitted to the Single Window Approval Committee twice. But, that it is not rejected.
The investor was informed to submit a complete project proposal with the required information.

The age of the lobsters: when underarm bowling was king
There is a particularly interesting episode of Revisionist History, Malcolm Gladwells often fascinating podcast, about Wilt Chamberlains 100-point game in the NBA and the importance in achieving that historic record of underhand free throws.
Chamberlain was a phenomenal basketball player, but at the particular skill of free throws he was unusually weak. Indeed, only two people in the entire history of the NBA (counting only those with more than 1,200 attempts  not as many as it sounds) have been worse than him. Across his career Chamberlain had a 51.1% success rate  horribly bad compared with an NBA average of around 75%, and ludicrously inferior to the all-time top free-throw shooters, who average a shade over 90%.
But on the night of 2 March 1962 Chamberlain was a master. He made 28 of his 32 attempts that night, an 87.5% success rate, and it was not a one-off. Before that season the Philadelphia Warriors head coach, Frank McGuire, convinced Chamberlain to try throwing underhand, and across that season he made 61.3% of his free throws. At its end he abandoned the experiment and went back to throwing overhand. In six of the seasons that followed he averaged less than 45%, bottoming out at 38% in 1967-68, but there was no going back.
The reason for his decision was simple: the underhand method is widely and pejoratively known as a granny shot, seen as being the lame recourse of those not skilled enough to throw properly. I felt silly, like a sissy, shooting underhanded, Chamberlain wrote in his autobiography. I know I was wrong. I know some of the best foul shooters in history shot that way. I just couldnt do it.
In my early childhood games of cricket almost every player had a go at bowling, falling into one of three groups. There were those whose only hope of vaguely threatening the stumps was to bowl underarm, the youthful prodigies who could reliably sling down vaguely accurate overarm deliveries, and the most hapless bunch of them all, those whose ability was no better than the first group but who bowled overarm anyway. These were children who, for fear of making themselves look silly, made themselves look silly.
Neville Cardus, the Guardians venerable cricket writer and an advocate of underarm, or lob, bowling, addressed the issue of the styles lack of credibility after the death of Sussexs brilliant Walter Humphreys in 1924. No doubt the man in the street will smile at the mere mention of lobs. Grubs, he calls them derisively, he wrote. But surely the success of Humphreys modest art, at a period great in batsmanship, cannot be dismissed with a smile of indulgence.
Humphreys also helped George Simpson-Hayward, probably the greatest modern lob bowler, or lobster as they became known, to hone his art. He spent three years practicing lobs before he first used them in a match, with instant success. Pelham Warner reported that when he made his England debut in South Africa in 1910 the crowd roared with laughter when he first went on. He took six wickets for 42 runs.
The derision with which lob bowling was met was perhaps, Cardus wrote, actually an advantage, helping to tempt batsmen out of dull defensiveness. A batsman cannot stonewall for long against a lob bowler without feeling, down in his heart, that he is making a fool of himself, he wrote.
But there was more to lob bowling than attempting to humiliate batsmen into getting themselves out. Underarm bowling is inherently more accurate  the quoit player does not trust an overarm action, as Cardus notes  and allows greater and more varied spin to be applied to the ball. Plus by the 1920s lob bowling was so unusual that opponents no longer knew how best to play it. As Cardus saw it, every county ought to encourage a likely lob bowler just because every other county doesnt.
It is also possible to bowl underarm and at pace. David Harris was the fastest bowler of his day (though his day was in the late 18th Century); Brightons George Brown, a tree-trunk-limbed father of 17 who played a century later, was so quick his teams had to deploy two long stops. According to legend on one occasion they both missed the ball, which even when it reached the boundary was going so fast that it struck and instantly killed a passing dog.
We are all too apt to make of our pastimes pretty routine affairs, with too much hard professionalism spoiling the surprise and gusto which are the life and soul of sport, Cardus opined in 1919. Let us have back the lob then, and the batsman on his toes, the men in the outfield keen and palpitating just a little, the crowd buzzing anticipation.
The world of cricket did not heed the cry. Indeed two years later when Trevor Molony made the first of three appearances for Surrey  taking the wicket of Jack Hobbs in a trial game  the Guardian noted that lobs are such an unfamiliar sight in these days that his efforts were watched with much interest (according to the Cricketer on one occasion the batters discomfort at his bowling evinced much laughter from the crowd). Approaching a century later Molony remains the last specialist lob bowler to play first class cricket.If we try to discover some explanation for the present universal neglect of lob bowling, we shall probably be right in suggesting as the first and greatest, fashion, the Guardian wrote in 1931. It does now require some moral courage for a boy to begin and continue bowling lobs in a society which regards them as a slightly fatuous jest.
Would a great lobster have any chance of thriving in todays game It is impossible to say, as nobody alive has ever seen one, and it is unlikely now that they ever shall. The accuracy and unpredictability of Simpson-Hayward represent a test that can only be faced in the imagination. But, and this is the crux, did it die out because it was considered inferior, or because it was considered infantile  theguardian

Akila tells teachers: Enhance knowledge to suit present day needs
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam urged teachers to become professionals by enhancing their knowledge to suit the present day needs.
The Minister said so while addressing the Guru Prathbha Prabha 2018,teacher felicitation ceremony at the BMICH yesterday.
The Guru Prathbha Prabha felicitation ceremony is organised annually by the Education Ministry in line with World Teachers Day celebrations, at which 384 teachers and principals were felicitated for their unique and dedicated service.
Minister Kariyawasam added that the world knowledge doubles every 13 months. Therefore, the teachers are duty bound to upgrade and update their knowledge accordingly. Otherwise, they will not be able to keep abreast with the ever changing world.
In the 1900s, it took 100 years to double the world knowledge and in the 1940s, it took 25 years. But, now the knowledge in the world doubles every 13 months, he said.
The Minister emphasised the need for teachers to upgrade their knowledge to become professionals. The Education Ministry has taken a number of measures to help teachers advance their knowledge.
Teachers should be professionals by gaining more knowledge and improving their existing knowledge. Within the next three years, you should become professionals by gaining more knowledge. It is a challengeable task, Minister Kariyawasam noted. You teachers should enrich yourselves with knowledge, he added.
The Minister added that teachers are responsible in guiding the children and making them responsible citizens, he added.
Passing examinations is not sufficient, if a student cannot be a valuable person to the country and the world, the Minister said.
Minister Kariyawasam said whatever the examination, it measures the knowledge of a candidate. You cannot judge the goodness or value of a student just by the success at an examination. We need students with humane qualities who care for their fellow beings.
You should try to become a better teacher, whose name will always be etched in the hearts of the students. The names of good teachers, who guided us on the correct path will always remain in our hearts, he said.
He added that all education sector vacancies will be filled by December 31 this year.
Applications will be called for principal and teacher vacancies in due course. Accordingly, all teacher vacancies in National Schools will be filled shortly. Applications are to be called for 400 officer vacancies in the Sri Lanka Education Administrative Service.
Besides, 1,000 recruits will be made to the Teacher Educationist service, the Minister noted.
It is planned to fill all vacancies by December 31st this year, the Minister added.

Amendments that strengthened the peoples sovereignty
Another important determination of the Supreme Court which impinged on the Sovereignty of the People was its ruling on the Extension of Life of Parliament. In 1982, this Bill was referred to the Supreme Court by the President in terms of Article 122(1) (b) of the Constitution. The Bill proposed to extend the period of the first Parliament. The Bill was introduced at a time when the life of the first Parliament under the ruling United National Party was reaching its end.
A strong school of protest emerged against the proposed amendment. The contention of the oppositionists was that the government party was adopting this measure in order to retain the two-third majority in Parliament it had secured at the General Election held in 1977 because it could never hope to obtain that majority if a general election is held under the proportional representation system introduced by the Second Republican Constitution of 1978. The long title of the Bill stated that the amendment was intended to be passed with the special majority required by Article 83 and submitted to the people by Referendum. Article 120 proviso (b) of the Constitution provides that 
Where the Cabinet of Ministers certifies that a Bill, which is described in its long title as being for the amendment of any provisions of the Constitution.. is intended to be passed with the special majority required by Article 83 and submitted to the people by Referendum, the Supreme Court shall have and exercise no jurisdiction in respect of such Bill.
The majority of the Supreme Court held that, In view of this provision this Court in terms of Article 120 proviso (b) does not have and exercise any further jurisdiction in respect of the said Bill.
It would appear that, the Supreme Court being a creature of the Constitution itself could not have ruled against the express provisions of the Constitution. But, what if the ruling party at the end of the extended period which it sought by the proposed Bill sought to extend once again its term of office with the special majority required by Article 83 and submitted to the people by Referendum Indeed in the face of Article 120 proviso (b), what was there to prevent the Cabinet from giving a certificate repeatedly at the end of each and every such extended period which the ruling party might have sought In such a situation would not the provisions of Article 62(2) of the Constitution (which provides that unless Parliament is sooner dissolved, every Parliament shall continue for six years from the date appointed for its first meeting and no longer, and the expiry of the said period of six years shall operate as a dissolution of Parliament), have been rendered a dead letter
The counter argument presumably would have been as to what legal objection could one have take when approval for whatever measure the government intends to take is sought directly from the people Indeed if such an amendment was sought to be achieved with only the special majority there could have been strong grounds for objection. But, when Article 4 (a) specifically provides that That legislative power of the people shall be exercised by Parliament . and by the people at a Referendum and the proposed Bill sought that every provision to be implemented, it is not difficult to find justification for the majority decision of the Supreme Court notwithstanding whatever political and / or moral arguments to the contrary.
On this view of the matter even repeated extension if sought through a referendum after obtaining the special majority in Parliament could be justified provided of course the conduct of the referendum is shown to be fair and lawful. If not, the referendum itself could be challenged in the Supreme Court and the provisions of Article 62(2) would then become operative. This illustrates the potential the concept of sovereign power of the people possesses within the framework of the present Constitution and the role the Supreme Court may be called upon to play in response to that concept.
It is however, the introduction of proportional representation in terms of which the Third Parliament under the present Constitution came to be elected in 1989 which has effectively prevented subsequent Parliaments including the present Parliament from resorting to the device employed by the Parliament of 1982, which unlike all Parliaments elected in and after 1989, possessed a two-third majority to bring into motion the procedure laid down in Article 120 proviso (b) to extend the life of Parliament. Such a response would surely spell out the limits of the concept of sovereign power of the people.
The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution Bill
This Bill which was introduced in Parliament in the year 1983 was directed at preventing any political party, organisation or person from encouraging or advocating the establishment of a separate State within the territory of Sri Lanka. The Bill provided that any person who acts in contravention of the constitutional prohibition on the espousal of the cause of a separate State shall on conviction by the Court of Appeal after trial on indictment forfeit his immovable and movable property. A similar penalty was sought to be imposed on any person who holds office in, or is a member of, a political party or organisation advocating cause of establishing a separate State. Responding to these provisions in the proposed Bill the Supreme Court held that they are inconsistent with the Provisions of Article 11 of the Constitution in that the forfeiture provided therein is without any qualification or limitation. Consequently, the Supreme Court held that the said provisions required to be passed by the two-third majority referred to in Article 83 and approved by the people at a Referendum.
Consequently, the Bill was amended and passed. What is to be noted here is that there is no mechanism in the Constitution to ascertain whether the legislation complies with a ruling of the Supreme Court. What if the legislature fails to comply with a determination of the Supreme Court Furthermore, what consequences are to attach if the legislative measures which purport to take into account the Supreme Court views on the vires of any one or more of the provisions in a proposed Bill in amending the original Bill do not in fact cure the evil There is no provision in the Constitution for further challenge to a proposed Bill but which purports to amend the original form to comply with a review of it by the Supreme Court. These add to the number of drawbacks in the present Constitution that affect the sovereign power of the people.
Wickremenayake v the State
The Bill entitled the Essential Public Services Bill, was challenged on the basis that certain provisions thereof contravened Article 14(1)(g),35(14)(h), and 14(1)(a) read with 14(1)(d) and 11 of the Constitution. What became conspicuous in the case from its outset was the fact that only Article 11 of the provisions which formed the basis of the petition was entrenched in Article 83. Nevertheless relying on Article 83 the petitioner contended that Article 83, when it refers to Articles 3 and 11, has the effect of entrenching all those fundamental rights which are declared and recognized in terms of Article 4(d) by the Constitution. Consequently, the argument was advanced that the proposed Bill required not merely a two-third majority, but also its approval by the people at a Referendum. Responding to this argument Samarakoon, C.J observed thus 
Adopting his argument that the entrenched Article 3 attracts Article 4, we find that Article 4 itself provides for the abridgement and restriction of the fundamental rights. This would take us to the provisions of Article 15, which sets out the manner and extent in respect of restrictions that can be placed on the fundamental rights.
Consequently, having held that, the relevant clauses of the Bill fall within the ambit of the restrictions contained in Article 15(5) and (7) in respect of the petitioners arguments based on Article 14(1)(a), (d), (g) and (h), His Lordship expressed the view that it was therefore unnecessary to consider the questions as to how many of the fundamental rights in Article 14 and to what extent they can be regarded as being entrenched for the purposes of Article 83. That situation would have arisen only if as the Court stated the restrictions now imposed were in excess of those permitted under Article 15(5) and 15(7).
The significance of His Lordships observations lies in the fact that although Article 14 does not find direct expression in Article 83 there could arise situations where a proposed Bill may impinge on Article 14 in a manner not covered under the restrictions contemplated by Article 15(5) and (7) which may therefore justify a ruling that read with Article 3, for such Bill to pass into law, Peoples approval at a referendum would be required in addition to a two-third majority in Parliament.
Sovereignty of the people is the primary source from which the Constitution derives its validity. Constitutional doctrines and concepts such as the separation of power and constitutionalism therefore must be defined an interpreted to give effect to the concept of sovereign power of the people.

Anti-rape activists win Nobel Peace Prize
NORWAY: Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege and Yazidi campaigner Nadia Murad won the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for their work in fighting sexual violence in conflicts around the world.
The pair won the award for their efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, Nobel committee chairwoman Berit Reiss-Andersen said in unveiling the winners in Oslo.
Mukwege, 63, was recognised for two decades of work to help women recover from the violence and trauma of sexual abuse and rape in war-torn eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
Known as Doctor Miracle, he is an outspoken critic of the abuse of women during war who has described rape as a weapon of mass destruction. Alongside Mukwege, the committee honoured Murad, a 25-year-old Iraqi woman from the Yazidi community who in 2014 was kidnapped by Islamic State militants and endured three months as a sex slave before managing to escape.
Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad have both put their personal security at risk by courageously combating war crimes and seeking justice for the victims, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said.

Britain to help Sri Lanka find lasting peace - Minister
A meeting between the Leader of the Opposition and the Tamil National Alliance R, Sampanthan and the Minister of State for Asia and the Pacific Mark Field, took place today at the Westminster House in Colombo.
Voicing his concern, Sampanthan pointed out that the conduct of this government was undoubtedly different to the conduct of the former government, but that alone is not enough. Citing consecutive UN Human Rights Council Resolutions, Sampanthan pointed out that that the government requested two-year time to implement the resolution, but the process of implementation has been very slow. Furthermore, he expressed his concerns over the undue delay in matters which could have been done without many efforts. The delays in releasing of land owned and cultivated by civilians for centuries which are now occupied by the Armed Forces even after 9 years since the end of war, the issue of concerning the political prisoners who are being held under a draconian PTA law, a law that the Government gave several undertakings to repeal, but which is still in existence, the Office of the Missing Persons came to be in place after a long delay they are endeavouring to be effective, these are matters which could have been addressed without delay, said Sampanthan. Further, Sampanthan pointed out that the Truth Commission had not been appointed yet, no one can conceal things and the truth must be ascertained thats our position. The Truth Commission must be in place to ascertain the truth and to bring about justice.
Briefing the Minister on the new Constitutional making process, Sampanthan highlighted the fact that the demands of the Tamil people for a genuine power-sharing arrangement must be addressed through a new Constitution and there had been much work done around this matter for the past 20 years. Every successive President and Government have made efforts towards a new Constitution and this must be done without further delay, said Sampanthan. We are wishing for a solution within a united, undivided and indivisible Sri Lanka and our people have accepted this stand and have repeatedly voted for this mandate at every election, said Sampanthan. We wish to live in this country as equal citizens, with self-respect and dignity and the people must have powers to decide over their day to day matters, which is a democratic verdict of the people and it must be respected and upheld, Sampanthan said. Furthermore, we do not wish our young people to return to violence, our youth have been deprived of many things due to the armed conflict and we dont want that to be continued, Sampanthan said.
TNA Spokesman and Jaffna District Parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran expressed his concerns over the lack of political will from the leaders in taking this process forward and explaining it to the people. We have managed to reach a consensus on many matters, Sumanthiran, said. Yet, there seems to be reluctance from the leaders of other political parties taking this forward, he added.
Sampanthan also cautioned that if this opportunity is missed that the country would certainly go backwards, regardless of who is in power. Therefore, all parties must come together to address this longstanding issue to find a permanent solution and any failure on the making of a new Constitution, would lead this country once again towards violence, Sampanthan said.
Speaking on the UNHRC resolution, Sampanthan pointed out that it was a cosponsored resolution and the Government must be held accountable for its commitments. The resolution must be implemented and the Government cannot evade from doing justice to its own people. The resolution must remain unaltered and implemented fully and our position is that the government has an obligation to abide by its own commitments, Sam
