Investor failed to submit required documents
The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI), in statement to the media, categorically refuted allegations in an article in a newspaper on September 23 that a Railway project was blocked due to corruption.
The real reason that the project is not yet approved was because the investor failed to provide the BOI with important documents such as past project reports, financial credentials, and proof that the company has the right technical capabilities to handle a project of that magnitude, the BOI statement said.
Following is the full text of the BOI statement:
The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka refers to the article dated 23.09.2018 published in a newspaper covering a proposed Railway project that was not yet approved due to the investor failing to submit the required information to the BOI to obtain the clearance of the Single Window Investment Approval Committee (SWIAC).
SWIAC was established by the Government to grant approvals for this type of large-scale investment projects.
The article makes a series of allegations relating to the project, naming several leading political figures and senior officials of the BOI. The application is for a project that was allegedly blocked in the article due to corruption.
However, the real reason that the project is not yet approved was because the investor failed to provide BOI with important documents such as past project reports, financial credentials and proof that the company has the right technical capabilities to handle a project of that magnitude.
This project proposal was discussed at the SWIAC several times chaired by Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga, the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance. On 10.11.2017, this proposal was taken up again at the SWIAC with the participation of the investors representatives. As the SWIAC ruled that the project proposal did not include comprehensive information, BOI was instructed by SWIAC to issue a letter informing the company that they need to submit the required documentation. The information has not yet been fully submitted.
The company in question also requested tax holidays which could not be accommodated under the present laws. To satisfy this potential investor, Sri Lanka would have had change the current legislation covering investments.
The company also requested for the project, the transfer of 4,000 acres of land including 2,000 acres of state land and also wanted to set up a private bank, in addition to setting up a university inside the factory premises. Furthermore, the company wanted to develop the Muthurajawela jetty which necessitated an additional 600 acres of state land. They also wanted to build super luxury hotels with liquor licences in each of their industrial zones to be set up.
However, their failure to provide details such as proof of their past experiences in building such projects, their financial credentials and technical knowhow made it impossible for BOI to approve a project that required handing over thousands of acres of state lands with no proof that it could be finalised. This information is what is normally requested from investors who apply to start projects.
Therefore, the BOI categorically refutes the allegations that were made and wishes to point out that at all stages the project was handled transparently and professionally, consistent with its role as a facilitator of projects that benefit the country.

Prof. Rohan Gunaratna tells nations leaders::
Stop extremists from polarising our youth
For many years Prof. Rohan Gunaratna has been advising and informing consecutive Sri Lankan governments on counterterrorism measures and existing terrorist threats in the country.
The Professor of Security Studies at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Nanyang Technology University (NTU), Singapore, has been a controversial figure over the years, both lauded and criticised for his claims in the field. However, the 57 year old has been successful in weaving a web of information around him, as he sits comfortably in his position as the head of the International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research in the city state.
Having worked for years understanding, studying and speaking of the LTTE in Sri Lanka, Prof. Gunaratna today is concerned with another extremist group. The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS).
In an interview at his office at NTU, he said the single-most important achievement of the yahapalana government so far has been the arrest of BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera. In August this year, the Appeal Court sentenced the controversial monk to 19 years of rigorous imprisonment to be completed within six years, on contempt of court charges.
It sends a clear message to the nationalists that the conduct of Ven. Gnanasara is unacceptable to the people of Sri Lanka. He should have also been investigated and prosecuted for his role in the violence of Dharga Town; that was a tragedy for the country.
As we reach 10 years since the end of the war, the post-war years have taught us of the ever-increasing need to maintain the peace that was hard won. For this, we need to increasingly contain the emergence of new threats to the countrys peace and security, observed Prof Gunaratna.
Extremist groups like the BBS, Mahason Balakaya, Ravana Balaya and Singha Le, he said, emerged in the backdrop of a very brutal terrorist group  the LTTE  which ravaged Sri Lanka for three decades.
It is true that the Tamil Tigers repeatedly massacred Buddhist monks, attacked temples,, Buddhist symbols and villages that were predominantly Sinhala Buddhist, trying to provoke a reaction.
But what motivates them now that the war has ended
I met Ven. Gnanasara Thera and interviewed him. When I asked him what the basis of the BBS ideology was, on the record he stated that it was modelled on the British National Party (racism), Le Pens National Rally party in France (anti-immigration), RSS in India (extremists) and Virathu in Myanmar (a monk whose teachings do not reflect the essence of Buddhism). The BBS ideology thus is not grounded in Buddhism and should be rejected. As such both the state and the Maha Sangha are responsible for protecting Buddhism and should not allow a great faith to be manipulated and misinterpreted.
Monitoring extremism
However, from the quiet embers of the conflict, these groups were able to grow and multiply. Spreading their reach to the grassroots and preying on prejudice and stereotypes. The war had also nurtured and promoted religious and ethnic exclusivism, turning communities into ethnic and religious silos, each operating without integration with the other. The violence has been a vicious by product of that, Prof. Gunaratna said.
During the conflict, the Sri Lankan government focused on dismantling the Tamil Tigers, but didnt pay attention or dedicate resources to monitor the polarisation of society into separate Sinhala, Tamil or Muslim communities or the emergence of these groups.
Prof. Gunaratna explained that although this is quite a relevant reaction for the Sinhala community that was affected by the LTTE, after 2009, there is no excuse for the continuity of these groups. If the rights of Sinhalese Buddhists are compromised, there are other ways to address their grievances and not through encouragement or approval of these groups. The very premise of these groups is detrimental to the long-term stability of Sri Lankan society and security of the state, he said.
For the Professor, though the threat of terrorism has receded since 2009, the threat of ideological extremism or exclusivism neither declined nor plateaued to prevent the escalation of religious and ethnic tensions.
Mismanaging these groups that are a persistent nuisance can be very costly to Sri Lanka; they must get their act together and act at least now, at this late stage, he said.
A more worrying aspect of these groups, however, is their membership mostly consisting of young men who are in their late teens or early twenties, the Professor says.
The ultra-Sinhala nationalist groups from BBS to Mahason Balakaya are reaching out to Sinhala youth including children and radicalising them to hate non-Sinhalese. Our most precious asset is Sri Lankas youth and these groups are preying on them by poisoning their minds with suspicion, prejudice and hatred. If this continues, we will have a segment of youth who will be unproductive and will not be able to understand and participate in the economic development and growth of the country.
A way out
If the current or next government does not address the rise of ethnic and religious groups and parties, communalism and communal violence will be an intermittent and frequent phenomenon, noted Prof. Gunaratne.
To combat the issue, he recommended both soft and hard measures. Soft measures such as the development of training programmes for leaders and public outreach campaigns to promote inclusivism where both ethnic communities and religious denominations are represented at all levels are important. Apart from that, harmony clubs at every school and harmony centres in every district to engage in interfaith and intercultural dialogue. Hard measures would be in terms of developing appropriate legislation to punish perpetrators and deter future would-be perpetrators.
When the poison of ethnic or religious extremism and exclusivism enters the bloodstream, interfaith and intercultural dialogue wont help; there must be a robust legal framework that is fairly functional to ensure that there is mutual respect between all religions and ethnic communities.
Against this backdrop, he proposed the introduction of a Harmony Act to deter communalism, prevent ethnic and religious extremism and to bring to justice those who insult other religions or ethnicity. The Act alone, however, would be of no use if violators from all religious and extremist groups are not taken to task without exception and favour.
A similar Act exists in Singapore, a country with 10 officially recognised religions and one of the most diverse places in the world. The powerful Act introduced in 1990, empowers the state to take action against any religious leader or person who attempts to cause hostility between groups, attempts to propagate their own religion, or use religion for any political purpose.
Formulating and passing such an Act is a sign of a mature democracy. Unfortunately successive Sri Lankan governments have ignored the polarisation of Sri Lankan society into Tamil, Sinhala and Muslim groups. If Sri Lanka is to maintain peace and stability in the future, it must also do away with Sinhala-only, Tamil-only and Muslim-only parties. As a small country, we cannot afford to be like India with political parties formed along ethnic lines.
He further stressed against having communities defined by geography,
In the coming decade, the students from the North should study in the universities of the South, and students from the South in the North, East in the West, and vice versa.
The government should not have any public schools or universities dedicated to any ethnic or religious community. Mainstream schools should not teach any one particular religion but teach comparative religion or religion humanism where humanity is placed before individual faiths. For most Sri Lankans, such an initiative would be difficult to understand because they have been polarised by three decades of ethnic conflict.
More importantly, he asked that the Sri Lanka clergy be at the forefront of disciplining the monks who disgrace Buddhism and take a stand without favour.
The emergence of the BBS and the damage it has inflicted to the Sri Lankan nation and its reputation is huge. Buddhist monks who violate the basic laws of Buddhism should be punished not only by the courts of law but also by the Sangha councils. In Myanmar, there is a gag order against Virathu who has tarnished the image of the country.
One must never forget that politics and religion should be separate at all times and the lesson we learnt from the assassination of former Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike should have made that clear, he added.
For the last 30 years, Prof Gunaratnas attention had been mainly focused on the LTTE threat in Sri Lanka, but today he is worried about the lack of ethnic cohesion in the country. Ethnic and religious harmony is the foundation of peace and security, and peace and security is essential for the economic growth of any nation. Politicians should stop playing with fire by promoting ethnic and religious tensions, especially close to an election.
This will be unhealthy for a country like Sri Lanka that must maintain perfect ethnic and religious harmony towards building the Sri Lankan nation which is still a work in progress. After having experienced 30 years of brutal ethnic conflict, the Sri Lankan state and the Sri Lankan people should not play with fire once again, he added.

ADB $500 Mn to develop climate-resilient water, sanitation services  in Tamil Nadu
The Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved financing of up to $500 million for a multitranche financing facility (MFF) that will develop climate-resilient water supply, sewerage, and drainage infrastructure in at least 10 cities in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
With almost half of the state population living in cities, Tamil Nadu is the most urbanized of Indias large states, said ADB Senior Urban Development Specialist Mr. Ron Slangen. Managing this rapid urbanization is essential for sustaining its economic growth and alleviating poverty. The state suffers from recurring droughts and erratic monsoons linked to climate change resulting in severe water scarcity and urban flooding. ADBs support will help address these complex urban challenges through innovative and climate-resilient investmentand deeper institutional support.
While Tamil Nadu is a more advanced state in India accounting for the second largest contribution to Indias economy, the rapid influx of people to urban areas is putting severe pressure on infrastructure services and threatening the livability and competitiveness of cities. Urban service levels remain low, with less than half of households served by piped water, and nearly a third of supplied water lost through aging distribution networks resulting in an intermittent supply of 2 hours per day. Only 42% of households are covered by a sewerage network, with 43% of sewage disposed directly into waterways untreated.
The ADB program will provide direct assistance in these areas as part of its support to the states Vision Tamil Nadu 2023 to provide universal access to water and sanitation and to develop world-class cities in high-performing industrial corridors.
ADBs financing will be provided in three tranches between now and March 2022. It will develop climate-resilient sewerage collection and treatment and drainage systems in 10 cities, and install the countrys first solar-powered sewage treatment plant on a pilot basis. The program will introduce smart water management systems to reduce non-revenue water and strengthen operational efficiency. Around 4 million people will benefit from piped water and sewerage connections and improved drainage. Beyond physical investments, the program will boost institutional capacity, public awareness, and urban governance as part of a comprehensive approach for developing livable cities.
The first tranche of the program amounting to $169 million will target the cities of Chennai, Coimbatore, Rajapalayam, Tiruchirappalli, Tirunelveli, and Vellore. A $2 million grant from the Asian Clean Energy Fund, established by the Government of Japan, will fund the solar energy pilot project. The Government of India, Government of Tamil Nadu, Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board, and various urban local bodies will provide $766.4 million toward the total program cost. An ADB technical assistance grant of $1 million will accompany the program to support capacity building. The MFF availability period is up to 30 June 2026.
ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 67 members48 from the region. In 2017, ADB operations totaled $32.2 billion, including $11.9 billion in cofinancing. (ADB)

IWA Congress in Sri Lanka next year:
Agendas to be set on water
The objectives of the International Water Association (IWA) Congress and Exhibition to be held in Colombo next year is to set agendas on water and sustainable development, and to form a platform to enhance sector policies, good practices and appropriate technologies to manage water related issues, Urban Development and Water Supply State Minister Lucky Jayawardena said.
He was addressing the IWA World Congress  2018 held in Tokyo, Japan, recently.
The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) conducts a research and development symposium every year along with the World Water Day events in March.
As we are now planning the IWA Congress and an exhibition in August next year, we will hold the research and development symposium of NWSDB as a side event of the Congress, he said.
The minister said: with this we are planning to enhance the quality and standard of our research and development symposium.
It will also give an opportunity for NWSDB professionals to expand their horizons by taking part in the symposium which will be a part of the IWA conference.
The conference will also include an industrial exhibition with over 100 stalls for local industries and partners to promote their business with local and foreign participants to help the local industry to secure more business.
The IWA Congress and exhibition will be organised in collaboration with the City Planning and Water Supply Ministry.
The conference will give an opportunity to showcase the work being undertaken in Sri Lanka in water and wastewater fields. Furthermore, the conference would attract high-level representatives from the water sector, funding institutions, regulators, operators and specialized companies involved in the sector, the State Minister said.
By providing learning and international networking opportunities, the IWA Congress would benefit the professional development of Sri Lankan water and environmental professionals, engineers, chemists, regulators, and policymakers, he said.
It will provide Sri Lankan institutions an opportunity to negotiate with international partners, and could create potential business opportunities. The event will also provide exposure to young professionals, as well as training, he added. The most contemporary challenge faced by us is the water resources constraints and integrated water management challenges. We have adapted the desalination option and developed dedicated storage reservoirs for drinking water purposes. In this context, we suggest that the theme of next years IWA conference in Sri Lanka should be in line with water resource allocation, sharing, reservation and integrated management, the State Minister said.

All-important discipline

Discipline is rewarded by privilege. Responsibilities shouldered properly are rewarded by success. Perfect Prefects features Head Boy of Wycherley Aaron Fernando and Head Girl of Wycherley Camlina Jeganathan who are working hard to meet their targets.
Head Boy of Wycherley Aaron Fernando feels shouldering your responsibilities is something you need to take seriously if you want to go places. Desire without discipline will still amount to nothing. The first lesson that education teaches you is to be disciplined.
Role model
What Wycherley has done for me is instilling that all-important discipline. It has been focused on education and discipline, and I feel that in those areas, I feel I have improved a lot. The way I have been taught to study and the way I have been advised throughout my life has been extremely beneficial to me. A role model needs to be a responsible person, who does not waste the resources they are given with, said Fernando.
Fernando points out that when facing a difficult problem or obstacle, it is mostly about trying to calm yourself down and find a strategy. Outline a course of action in your mind can help
The best thing is not getting tensed up. Because when you do get tensed up you dont see the solution. The best solution is to stay calm and work as hard as possible. Failures will come all the time but just give your maximum effort. You have to build yourself up without feeling down and be patient. Success will come to you. Definitely, I look towards God for guidance, said Fernando.
Without dreaming about a perfect life lets work towards it. Lets set goals and achieve them.
I really think we should work towards making the world a more peaceful place to live in with far less jealousy and greed and more love for each other. Even countries will stop fighting if people try to understand each others needs and act according to it. So without trying to put other people down because of greed try to do the opposite. Help others. Sometimes the discrimination is so bad that people have a very hard time living. I would like to see a world with more equality, explained Fernando.
Good life
Staying loyal to family and friends and helping whenever he can, is a priority.
I have planned out what I want to achieve in life, and I want to stay loyal to the people around me, and lead a good life where I can help anyone when I can. That would be my ambition, said Fernando.
Sometimes we need to listen to our parents and only time will tell when we face the consequences.
My message to any young person is to listen to your parents and try to take the good out of everything and leave out the negatives. Half the teenagers in this world and this generation focus on the negative side of life and spoil their lives. There is a positive side to every situation. Take the positives, leave out the negatives, and go on with your lives, points out Fernando.
Every child needs to go to school. Every child needs to be educated. How they make use of these opportunities is a choice they must have to make.
In poor families, they just think of making money and no much thought is given to education. The send their kids to beg on the roads and do not realize that education can release their children from poverty and create a future for them where they can improve the quality of their lives. When they can earn money. So we need to raise awareness about these issues and I think that that is very important, explained Fernando.
Specific time frame
For him, it has been a gradual process where he has built himself up.
What I have achieved in life cannot be limited to a specific time frame. What I have achieved can be traced back through my life. What I have experienced throughout my life has made me the complete person I am now, and I cant thank each and every one individually, but I credit my success to those who have been with me in my past up until now, said Fernando.
Head Girl of Wycherley, Camlina Jeganathan felt that ethics is the cornerstone of good leadership.
It is easy to lose focus when you have power. Too often we hear stories about how people in high places abuse their power. The young should not be misled. The importance of proper leadership should be instilled in them, said Jeganathan.
A clear and well-organized mind is usually a result of a well thought out plan.
When facing a problem, the game plan is to stay calm and think about all the possible solutions and even ask other people for their opinions, and try not to be enmeshed in views, stated Jeganathan.
Wycherley has given her an arena where she has developed her skills. It has made her more confident, being thrust into positions where she had to go to that next level.
Confident individual
At Wycherley, I started out as a bit of a naughty kid, but soon learnt to handle responsibility. Receiving this position has made me more confident and I never thought I would do public stuff like giving speeches. My school has moulded me into a very confident individual. I learn things about different people like my parents and my friends because they teach me a lot of things. But I always look up to God for help, inspiration and when it comes to overcoming problems, explained Jeganathan.
Homeless people are some of the saddest people in the world. Living on the streets is awful. Poverty can seriously affect your mental health.
I think when it comes to poverty and homeless people, we can help in some way or another. Even Rs. 100 given by a person can make a huge difference in that homeless man or womans life. It could prevent him or her from going hungry. It doesnt have to be necessarily a selfish world as it is now. We can all contribute and help others, pointed out Jeganathan.
The field of medicine is a field she wishes to join. Because this will enable her to widen her scope and help people.
I want to be a doctor where I can help people and being a doctor is a very well respected job. It is a job where you can express your care for people. I cannot provide financial help for everyone, which is impossible, but I can contribute in a small way by helping a smaller group of people, said Jeganathan.
Important education
Raising awareness is something that needs to be done in this society when it comes to issues that involve the infringement of peoples rights.
There is also too much corruption these days and we need to raise awareness about issues that people should be more aware of such as poverty and education. Even an interact club in a school can raise awareness in a small way. My message to young people is to be more confident and not take what everyone says to heart. Education is very important. So go to school. Just do not mind the bullies because there are a lot of them these days. Stay focused on what you want to do and what you are passionate about. Keep going in that direction, explained Jeganathan.

## Title: AN APOLITICAL, PARTYLESS PRESIDENT
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Wednesday, September 26, 2018 - 01:00
AN APOLITICAL, PARTYLESS PRESIDENT
The next Presidential election in Sri Lanka is scheduled to be held in January 2020. According to article 30.3 of the Constitution; the poll for the election of the President shall be taken not less than one month and not more than two months before the expiration of the term of office of the President in office.
Accordingly, if the President wishes, the election can be held within two months after any day preceding November 10, 2019. Despite this provision, article 30.3 (a) of the constitution states that; Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding provisions of this Chapter, the President may, at any time after the expiration of four years from the commencement of his first term of office, by Proclamation, declare his intention of appealing to the People for a mandate to hold office, by election, for a further term. If the president expresses such an interest, the elections commission has to take the necessary steps to call for a Presidential election.
President Sirisena recently made a statement with regard to this and pointed out that he has no intention of calling for a Presidential election prior to the expiry of his term. Therefore, we can come to an assumption that the next Presidential election will be held after December 10, 2019.
These days, the discourse surrounding the upcoming Presidential election is centred on who will come forward as candidates to contest the election. The leaders of the SLFP clearly state that the current President will again stand up for reelection. The UNP has also made it clear that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will be their chosen candidate for the upcoming Presidential election.
Constitutional provisions
On contrary to these, the Joint Opposition is facing a serious political crisis in deciding who their desired candidate is. It is a fact that Mahinda Rajapaksa cannot stand in for re-election due to the constitutional provisions laid out in the 19th Amendment and therefore, the joint opposition has been unable to resolve their political differences and come out with an alternative candidate to Mahinda Rajapaksa based on a common consensus. The JVP has also kept silent about whether they will field a candidate and likewise, the Tamil and Muslim parties too are yet to make statements as to whether they too will field Presidential candidates.
On the contrary to all these, the National Movement for Social Justice, which is a civil society organisation states that they are expecting to field in a Partyless or apolitical candidate for the next Presidential election like in 2015. In the election held in January 2015, the National Movement for Social Justice supported President Maithripala Sirisena. But currently, it is clear that this movement is at loggerheads with the current President. The current President came to power on the promise of being independent but within days of becoming President, he betrayed his own promises made to the civil society and became the President of the SLFP. This is why the National Movement for Social Justice is again reiterating the idea that a Partyless or apolitical President should be appointed.
But it is seriously questionable as to how realistic this whole notion is. A human being, who has an ounce of knowledge about the nature of politics and of the relationship politics has with human beings will definitely understand that the notion of a Partyless President is an ultra-utopian idea. This is mainly due to two major reasons.
Firstly, the post of President is the highest extremely politicized position in the state above all other administrative officers and it is impossible to carry out its duties and functions whilst being independent or by being partyless. Secondly, in a politically organised community, it is virtually impossible to find a candidate who will have no affiliations towards a political party. In order to understand this situation, one must initially understand what is meant by politics and then understand the nature of the relationship between human beings and politics.
Generally, the struggle between individuals or groups to capture state power is described as politics. This particular struggle can be either done by following democratic means through elections or through revolutionary methods by using arms and ammunition. Whatever the form this struggle takes, it can be said that politics arose within the human society due to two main reasons.
Social, economic and political problems
The first reasons is the lack of a common policy and a political ideology in solving political, economic and social problems in a human society. In other words, there is no one common policy or a common agreement as to how these social, economic and political problems can be mitigated because different ideologies approach them differently. These ideologies are usually based on liberal democracy, socialism or social democracy. Secondly, after capturing state power, these policies (whatever the policy is) will be translated into practical action by political actors. These political actors/political activists can be either individuals or political parties. In modern times, political parties take precedence over political actors in engaging in such political activities. Therefore, the emergence of politics is a direct result of the conflict in selecting an ideology which will best solve the problems in a politically organised community.
Further, it also becomes evident that an individual who is not bound to these ideologies cannot engage in politics and hence, politics is something which one cannot do in an independent and nonparty affiliated vacuum. So, a person who engages in politics will eventually have to subscribe to liberal democracy and capitalism or believe in socialism and communism or if not subscribe to social democracy. If a person does not believe in any of these ideologies, he/she will at least have to believe in fascism. So, the notion of a partyless independent President is an absolute utopian idea that cannot be translated into practical political action.
When we take into account the nature of the relationship which exists between people and politics this becomes much clear. Everyone who is born into this world lives and dies within a state. Whenever a human being is born, the initial step is to notify the state and get a birth certificate after registering the birth. Likewise, whenever a human being dies, the most immediate action is to notify the state and get the death certificate.
In between these two phenomena, a human being may live for a number of years, but whatever that number is, other than breathing, all the actions performed by a human being is controlled by the state.
For example, as stated before, a birth should be registered in the state as soon as a child is born. For individuals, to legally marry, the marriage has to be registered in the state. To give birth a woman must go to a government hospital. For primary education, children must go to a school run by the government. For higher education one must go to a government university. Whenever one is sick, he/she must go to a government hospital. To travel, one must embark on the journey in a government bus or train.
State responsibilities
When searching for employment, the preference is always given to a government job. When one retires, a pension is paid by the government. For marginalized groups, the government provides welfare. Electricity and water are provided by the government to homes. Eating, wearing clothes and walking on the road also takes place according to the rules of the government. Even, if one is frustrated of life, that person does not have the right to commit suicide as it is illegal. Finally, after all this, when a person dies, it is necessary to notify the state and get the death certificate without which last rites cannot be legally performed. After that, the burial also takes place in state cemetery and if the body is incinerated, that too has to be conducted in a government crematorium.
Even after death, the involvement of the state and the government in a persons life does not end. If the person who died does not leave a last will or failed to transfer the property under his/her name to the next of kin or any other entity, the last decision with regard to that property will be taken according to state law. Even though some of these activities are performed by the private sector, they too have to be carried out according to the laws and regulations of the state.
So, from the above description, it becomes clear as to what sort of a stronghold the state and the government has on individual lives. In short, other than the process of breathing, all other elements of human lives are controlled by the state. Even though one might interpret all these as day to day menial functions, when looked at critically, these are directly or indirectly related to politics.
A state or a government cannot conduct these activities according to their whims and fancies. They have to carry them out according to an established political and economic ideology. This is why it is impossible to engage in politics without a political party. So all those engage in politics at one level or the other should understand this and not promote utopian ideas that a partyless President should be brought forth. On the contrary to this, what should be done is to subscribe to an established and accepted political philosophy and accordingly engage in politics.
For this purpose, one can follow capitalism, socialism or social democracy. In practical terms, when we look at the political history of the world, it becomes clear that all these three ideologies have failed in eventually solving problems faced by human societies. But, capitalism has somehow managed to drag itself forward among the rest. Hence, political activists should understand this reality and engage in politics by aligning themselves with a political party following a definite political philosophy without talking about an untenable utopian partyless political paradigm.

Army Commander calls for BIMSTEC regional strategy to strengthen security
BIMSTEC member states should develop a regional strategy by networking for addressing the terrorist threat and transnational crimes that involve not just within all member countries, but regional and global organisations that have already been set up to meet these challenges, Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake said.
While appreciating the Indian Armys initiative in this endeavour, Lt.Gen.Senanayake said that interaction within geographical communities shold be strengthened which justifies the need for a collective effort such as the BIMSTEC initiative.
Lt.Gen. Senanayake in his contribution to the BIMSTEC Army Chiefs Conclave focused on the question of Drug Trafficking, Human Smuggling, Transnational Crime and Terrorism and explored possibility of creating a more viable regional security architecture to deal with transnational crimes and challenges of terrorism.
Army Commander Lt. Gen.Mahesh Senanayake was delivering a lecture on the main theme of the Conclave, Possibility of Creating Viable Regional Security Architecture to deal with Threats-Terrorism & Transnational Crime at the first Conclave of its kind for any such grouping in South Asia, hosted by the Indian Army.
He further pointed out that apparatuses of terrorism, transnational organised crime and radicalisation, have seized the attention of marginalised groups all around the world and terrorism has not only shaken the fundamentals of human rights, but also it has posed a threat and an intimidation for the pillars of statehood.
The government of Sri Lanka acknowledges that terrorism, transnational crime and radicalisation are widespread issues that can be resolved only with the resilient cooperation of all states in the region. Sri Lanka also understands that efforts at the grass root level are also significant in countering these threats, Lt.Gen.Senanayake said.
Touching on the subject of Terrorism and Counter Terrorism, he recalled how the Sri Lanka Army tackled the threat. Sri Lanka has grappled with the LTTE terrorism for nearly three decades and is aware of how hard it is to identify and thwart terrorist activities. Use of hard power to defeat LTTE was a failure. Using of soft power alone led to strengthening of the LTTE. When we were in peace negotiation, the LTTE has regrouped, reorganised and sophisticated. Ultimately, the application of both hard and soft power with the cooperation of friendly foreign countries made the way for Sri Lanka to win the war against terror, he noted.
Tomorrows terrorism needs a far more balanced application of both hard and soft power tools, which we can call smart power. Sri Lanka already experiences this with the Tamil Diaspora creating the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam, going to the extent of holding elections and creating a virtual parliament that propagates separatism in Sri Lanka.
Elaborating on the question of Transnational Crimes, Lt.Gen.Senanayake explained;Sri Lanka faces two aggravated challenges which are People Smuggling and Drug Smuggling. These challenges are also core regional problems that cannot be countered by the Sri Lankan Government in isolation. When it comes to People Smuggling, Australia has been one focus of cooperation, among many for the Sri Lankan Government.
He pointed out that the Australia - Sri Lanka Joint Working Group on People Smuggling and Other Transnational Crime was formed in 2012 to complement the latter agreement.
With that, I am proud to say that the Sri Lanka Navy and law enforcement authorities have succeeded in arresting a total of 124 boats and more than 13,500 illegal immigrants moving from Sri Lanka to Australia in 2012 alone. Sri Lanka has been very successful in countering human smuggling to Australia with increased cooperation between Sri Lankan and Australian authorities, he said.
When it comes to Drugs, Lt. Gen. Senanayake summarized the series of preventive measures, being adopted by various agencies in Sri Lanka.
The Police Narcotics Bureau, being the specialised unit in Sri Lanka performs its duties in two ways. Firstly, it considers as a priority to reduce the supply of drugs targeting major drug traffickers. Since drug trafficking is an internationally affected problem, the Police Narcotics Department works closely with related Foreign Anti-Narcotics Agencies on information sharing and also to expedite investigations.
Recalling regional gestures of cooperation, the Army Commander commented. When it comes to cooperation among BIMSTEC member states in counter terrorism, I wish to recall that in 2012, a few Tamil youths were arrested in Chennai denying them sanctuary to plan and plot violent activity in Sri Lanka. Then again, another youth was arrested in Rameshwaram in July 2015 while he was attempting to move to Sri Lanka with detonators, cyanide capsules, mobile phones and a large amount of cash in hand. These important arrests made by Indian Law Enforcement facilitated investigations and judicial action against those trying to resort to terrorism in Sri Lanka.
He further underlined; Sri Lanka, alone, cannot respond to next wave of terrorism if at all it happens and therefore should forge partnership with countries, sharing common values to curb terrorism and transnational crimes.
I take this opportunity to make an open invitation to all senior military officers to study the Sri Lankan counter terrorism fighting strategies and our post-conflict development initiatives. I am confident those realistic strategies will surely enhance knowledge, skills and understanding of your respective militaries, Lt.Gen.Senanayake said.
Army Chiefs of Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical & Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) member nations recently met in Pune, India on the heels of the BIMSTEC Summit in Kathmandu.
The BIMSTEC Army Exercise, Military Field Training Exercise (MILEX - 2018), aimed at promoting strategic alignment among member states and share best practices in counter-terrorism in semi-urban terrain and cordon and search operations, an initiative of the Indian Army Chief General Bipin Rawat, was also conducted around the same time on the sidelines of the Army Chiefs Conclave at the College of Military Engineering under the aegis of the Southern Command of India.
Chief of Army Staff of India General Bipin Rawat, Chief of Army Staff of the Bangladesh Army, General Aziz Ahmed, Myanmars Deputy Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Commander-in Chief (Army) Vice Senior General Soe Win, Deputy Chief of Staff (Operations) of the Royal Thai Armed Forces, Lt.Gen. Choochart Buakhao and Deputy Chief Operations Officer of the Royal Bhutan Army, Brigadier Dorji Rinchen and their high level delegations were also present at the Conclave, together with Army Commander Lt. Gen.Mahesh Senanayake.
Former Ambassador of India G.Parasarthy acted as the moderator at the Army Chiefs Conclave where elaborate views were exchanged on promotion of security cooperation and inter and intra operability among the Armed Forces of BIMSTEC countries for carrying out anti-terrorism and preventing transnational crimes, exchange of information and experiences and ensuring a secure, peaceful and tranquil region.

Australias borders reinforced
Australia has reinforced the security of its maritime borders with expanded aerial surveillance and on-water patrols. These additional capabilities further secure all of the maritime approaches to Australias borders, the Australian High Commission stated in a release.
Since the introduction of its toughest ever border protection policies in 2013, Australia has been very successful in detecting, intercepting and deterring people smuggling ventures. Thirty three people smuggling vessels have been intercepted at sea, 827 people returned to their country of departure or origin, and countless others deterred or prevented from risking their lives on an illegal boat journey to Australia, the release stated.
The recent arrival in Australia of a people smuggling boat from Vietnam is a reminder of the need for ongoing vigilance and international cooperation to address the enduring threat posed by people smuggling.
All 17 people who arrived on this vessel were swiftly detained by Australian authorities and returned to Vietnam.
To reinforce the security of our borders, assets from the Australian Border Force, and additional resources from the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force have been mobilised to identify and intercept any suspicious vessel that approaches Australias borders, the release added.
Australias offshore people smuggling disruption efforts, led by the Australian Federal Police, have also been strengthened.
These actions should send a strong message to people smugglers and those who would engage their services: the Australian Governments determination to protect our borders, combat people smuggling and prevent deaths at sea, is stronger than ever, the High Commission stated.
The Australian Government will not tolerate a return to past circumstances under which more than 1,200 people died at sea attempting illegal journeys to Australia on unseaworthy vessels.
Australias border protection policy is clear, and as this reinforcement of our border protection capabilities shows, Australia will back up its words with decisive actions, the release added.

Crucial Super Four match today to decide finalist :
Bangladesh to exploit on Pakistans low confidence factor
DUBAI, Tuesday: Bangladesh will try to exploit the low confidence the Pakistan team are currently going when they meet their Asian rivals in what could be termed a semi-final clash of the Asia Cup Super Four at Abu Dhabi tomorrow (Wednesday).
With India already having booked their berth for Fridays final, the other finalist will be decided on the winners of the Bangladesh-Pakistan match.
Bangladeshs new head coach Steve Rhodes of England was optimistic about his teams chances against Pakistan.
I think we have got a great chance. We respect Pakistan as a team and they played really well to win the Champions Trophy not too long ago. Their tournament has been interesting. They're possibly playing with lack of little bit of confidence and not quite the same confidence as they were in the Champions Trophy but they are still a very dangerous team and on their day they can really put things together and play some good cricket, said Rhodes.
We are respectful to them as a team but we are also looking forward to the challenge. It'll be a great contest. We wanted to be in this position when we set off from Bangladesh; try and beat Pakistan and get through to a wonderful final against India.
Rhodes was confident that his batsmen will be able to take on the Pakistan fast bowling attack which is their main strength.
Yes, they come with some challenges. They have a little more pace but the wicket at Abu Dhabi has tended to be on the slower side so it hasn't necessarily been in favour of fast bowlers. That can be a good thing the ball can come on to the bat well, said Rhodes. Sometimes when the wicket is slow, facing medium-pacers might become a little more difficult. So because of the slowness of the wicket the ball will come nicely onto the bat with their pace. That is what Im hoping for, he said.
Rhodes said that Bangladeshs last ball three-run win over Afghanistan two days ago was a morale booster for the team. We lost the T20 against them (in June in India) and we lost the next game (in league stage) against them, so it was a boost. We are in good shape. Pakistan is the favourite for this game but that puts us in a nice position because they know we are a dangerous side. To go into that game as an underdog might work in our favour because we can really make that work.
Pakistans leading run-scorer in the current Asia Cup and their most experienced cricketer Shoaib Malik said the two losses to India was the best thing to happen and that they can work out on their weaknesses.
The best thing is to sit down and talk about it and come out with different plan. If the plans are not working then we must sit down and devise some other plan. We have lost to India in two games, there are areas where we have to improve, said Malik.
We have discussed them, communicated and you will see improvement. We are going through some tough times. This is not the end of the world. There will be changes, not team wise, but in terms of changing plans for individuals. Malik was of the view the Pakistan side lacked experience and that the experienced players were missing out on scoring the runs.
Our batting line up needs stability, these are not pitches where you look for 300-350. If you stay at the pitch, don't lose wickets then later in the innings you get a chance to score runs. We must play according to the situation, said Malik.
There is a lack of experience. The experienced players assess the conditions. That thing is missing but the players are talented they have given performances so I am sure they will come back, he said hopefully.

CCC inks MoU with Czech Chamber
The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Czech Chamber of Commerce at the Sri Lanka  Czech Republic Business Forum organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in association with the Consulate General of the Czech Republic in Sri Lanka.
Milan Hovorka said, the New Delhi based embassy to Sri Lanka is proud to bring together the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and the Czech Chamber of Commerce, because presently, bilateral trade is a mere 50 million USD, and there are almost no investments from either side. Therefore this is a step in the right direction to strengthen and promote business relations between Czech Republic and Sri Lanka.
The Chief Guest for the occasion, Malik Samarawickrama, Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade said, A few of the Czech business delegation that were in Sri Lanka comprised representatives of the pharmaceutical sector. This is a sector with which we are actively looking to develop.
We have a new industrial zone planned with the pharmaceutical sector specifically in mind, and also the requirements for high quality water, and intellectual property protection. The reason we arranged this business mission to Sri Lanka is because our economy exports 4/5 of industrial production to Western European countries, and 1/2 of the exports are to our immediate neighbour Germany. Due to our high employment rates, Czech Businesses are keen on seeking joint ventures in Sri Lanka to make use of its highly qualified labour and rich resources, in order to remain competitive and innovative.
We are also very much interested in trade exchange in order to provide a wide variety of goods for the consumers of the Czech Republic whose wages are high and increasing, said Guest of Honour Milan Stech, President of the Senate of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, while addressing the forum.
We have similar objectives and we enter into an alliance with Czech Chamber in order to promote the private sector business entities to become reciprocal partners and to extend all support cooperation and assistance to each other for the overall benefit of both countries, said Rajendra Theagarajah, Chairman of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.
The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, have already signed 128 memoranda of understanding to expand and further strengthen strong relationships with overseas trade promotion organisations for the benefit of business community in Sri Lanka.

Citizens' Mail
Avoid unnecessary Govt. expenditures and help the poor!
I was shocked and dismayed to hear that a couple from Kahatagasdigiliya had been starving without food for many days and fed with Murunga leaves. I think this disheartening act would have definitely grieved many of us who consume three belly full of meals every day. But none of us could help this starving couple was a misfortune.
I would like to reminisce here an anecdote in the history of Islam during the period of Caliph Omar, the second ruler of Arabia after Prophet Mohamed [Sal].
Once Caliph Omar thought of visiting around his kingdom on a monetary mission and set out his journey on his camel in a night. While he was on his way he heard some children were crying from a cottage. He accessed to the cottage and peeped through the hole of the door and saw a mother was boiling something in the pot and her three children squatting around her, crying. The sympathized Caliph tapped the door and the woman opened the door and he inquired why the children were crying.
The penurious woman retorted that her children were in extreme hunger and waiting to be fed before going to sleep. Again Caliph asked her what was she boiling in the pot. She said they were the seeds of dates, pretending that she was preparing food for them until they went to sleep. Caliph Omar was perturbed and astonished that there was severe poverty prevailing in his Kingdom.
Immediately, he rushed to his abode and brought wheat and other home needs and told the woman to prepare food and feed the children. The following day he reserved an amount of fund for poverty alleviation for the poor from the Baithul Maal the Islamic state treasury. This anecdotic incident shows us how a ruler acted responsibly and humanely for the people of his beloved country.
However, I appreciate the Presidents gesture of apologizing for this traumatic and grieving incident occurred in Khatagasdigiliya and deploying an official to look into the matter. It is quite timely and very much important for the president to launch a poverty alleviation programme immediately to help the poverty stricken and down trodden people of Sri Lanka, avoiding unnecessary Government expenditures.

Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. (CCBSL) partnered with the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) to collect PET bottles for recycling, at the National Program of the International Coastal Clean-up Day at Daddala Beach in Galle.
The event also included recycler Eco-Spindles Pvt Ltd. (BPPL Group) and volunteers from AIESEC partnering to demonstrate the positive impact of Harnessing the power of people towards an Ocean without Waste under the patronage and active involvement of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The initiative is part for The Coca-Cola Companys commitment towards help creating a World Without Waste. World Without Waste is the Coca-Cola Companys global goal to help collect and recycle the equivalent of 100% of its packaging by 2030. This goal is the centrepiece of the companys new packaging vision in Sri Lanka as well.
Rear Admiral (Retd) Rohana Perera, Chairman of Marine Environment Protection Authority said, The risk of pollution of the ocean around Sri Lanka is increasing daily due to the influence of increased use of contaminants connected with development activities and increasing population. Large quantities of non-degradable waste get absorbed into coast and marine environments directly or through the waterways.
Commenting on the successful initiative, Lakshan Madurasinghe Country Public Affairs, Communications and Sustainability Manager, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. said, The Give Back Life programs long-term vision is to work with host of strategic partners to deliver meaningful action towards a circular economy in which materials are used and reused to provide ongoing value.

Farmer insurance, a top priority  Minister
The present government has given high priority to the protection of local farmers and we have kept on improving their insurance coverage to give them maximum benefit, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was the chief guest at the inauguration of the World Bank workshop on index-based insurance held yesterday at Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo.
The Minister said that farmers often fall victim to natural disasters such as flood, drought and various other disasters. These natural disasters destroy and damage crops that they have carefully looked after. As a result of long spells of drought, farmers are unable to undertake cultivation.
These extreme weather conditions reflecting climate change require that government authorities and the policymakers pay greater attention to improving ways and means of providing relief and redress to those thus affected, the Minister said.
In addition to the adverse impacts on the farmers brought about by natural disasters, low market prices arising from gluts in local production also pave the way for depressed farmer incomes and loss of livelihoods. As a result, most countries have adopted crop insurance in various forms, he added.
Minister Amaraweera also said that Sri Lanka has had a fairly long history of agricultural or crop insurance. Starting with a pilot project to provide insurance coverage to paddy farmers, Sri Lanka enacted the Agriculture Insurance Law in 1973 under which the Agricultural Insurance Board was set up. The Agriculture and Agrarian Insurance Board was established in 1999 under Act No 20, and insurance cover has been provided for a series of agricultural activities and crops.
In May this year, we made arrangements to provide insurance coverage for six crops which include paddy, maize, chillies, soya bean, big onions and potatoes. The most important feature of this scheme is that the full insurance premium is paid by the government without burdening farmers. This way, the government aims at ensuring that the farmers concerned will continue with cultivation of these important crops, without any fear of heavy losses in income, said the Minister.
He further said that there are many more measures that need to be taken to ensure that crop insurance schemes address the critical issues facing vulnerable farmers.
We need to take prompt action to provide redress in the case of disasters and take fair and objective decisions in providing timely compensation, he added.
He further added that the index-based scheme now used in several countries, is a more efficient and a cost-effective system.
But we need to make whatever modifications necessary to suit our countrys needs. I am sure that this system will help us to provide a better service and speedy relief to our farmer communities in a transparent manner, the Minister added.
Deputy Agriculture Minister Angajan Ramanathan, Ministry Secretary B. Wijeratne, Agriculture and Agrarian Insurance Board Chairman S. Wirithamulla, and World Banks International Finance Cooperation (IFC) Country Manager Ameena Ariff also participated in the event.

Giant spiders' web in  Greece tourist resort
It is a scene reminiscent of a science fiction movie - but this is in fact a huge spiders web.
The eerie sight stunned locals in western Greece, where creepy crawlies went to work creating a blanket covering a huge area of greenery.
The web, in Aitoliko, is around 1,000ft, or 300 metres, in size. Experts believe that warm weather is to blame, with conditions ideal for spiders who come to the tourist hotspot to mate.
A rise in the mosquito population could also explain the phenomenon. The spiders behind the unusual masterpiece are reported to be Tetragnatha insects. But anyone who wants to see the web should get there soon, as it is not expected to last long.
Professor Maria Chatzaki told Newsit,High temperatures, sufficient humidity and food created the ideal conditions for the species to reproduce in large numbers. Its as if the spiders are taking advantage of these conditions and are having a kind of a party.
However their excitement will not have a happy ending, she said.
Prof Chatzaki stated, The spiders will have their party and will soon die.
Tetragnatha spiders are often referred to as stretch spiders because of their long bodies, and commonly make their webs close to large areas of water.

Highest rupee depreciation recorded during MRs time - Mangala
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who was also the countrys Finance Minister has completely forgotten that the rupee had depreciated against dollar by 14 per cent in 2012.
He could not event control the depreciation of rupee even after pumping US$ 4.1 billion foreign reserves, Minister Samaraweera added.
The value of rupee against the dollar saw unprecedented decline in 2012 under the rule of former Finance Minister and present Kurunegala District Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa, he said.
Sri Lanka will plunge into a debt crisis, if the countrys foreign reserves are used to prevent the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar.
He said that the Rajapaksa government has left the government with a legacy of massive debt running into billions and the countrys foreign reserve is used to repay these debts.
The Finance and Media Minister was responding to various statements made by opposition Parliamentarians including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa over the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar.
We have over US$ 8 billion in Foreign Reserves. This money was used sparingly as the government has to repay massive loans obtained by the previous government, Minister Samaraweera said.
Samaraweera added that the present government has to pay Rs. 1.9 trillion this year as loan installments.
We have to repay another Rs. 4.1 trillion within next for years too, he added
The Minister added that the country will plunge into an economic crisis as experienced in Greece and Argentina, if foreign reserves are used to control depreciation of the local currency against the dollar without repaying the debts.
Many developing countries are faced with the challenge of depreciation of their local currency against the dollar with the increase of interest rates of US banks, he said.
India, Indonesia, Russia, Australia, and the Philippines are experiencing the depreciation of their local currency against dollar due to massive development in the US market, he said.
Many investors who made investments in other countries with the onset of the banking crisis in the US in 2008, have started pulling out their money from these countries and investing in US banks for better returns. This situation has strengthened the dollar, Minister Samaraweera said.

HP plans entry into refurbished market in India
HP Inc is exploring entry into the refurbished market for personal computers in India, as part of its push to make affordable products, its top executive told ET.
Refurbished products are second-hand computers repaired to be resold or products that are made by reusing and recycling different components of various computers.
One of the big pillars we are focusing on affordability in India. We know in India we have to give the price value proposition. We are looking at is the refurbished market in India. It is a large market and it is largely unorganized, said Sumeer Chandra, MD, HP Inc in India.
HP is making a big push towards affordability in India. Recently the company launched mini-desktops starting at a price range of Rs. 19990 for students and education institutes.
We are looking at it and seeing if there is a way we can participate in the market, either by providing our own refurbished product or come up with an alternate product that would compete with the refurbished product, he said.
While India has seen a surge in smartphone adoption with over 350 million users, PC adoption has still be in low. In 2017, less than a ten million PCs were sold in the country and companies are seeing double digit growth. Yet, it is still small.
Chandra feels a refurbished market will give HP an entry into a price sensitive segment of the population who is familiar with a smartphone but has never used a computer before. It will rely on its extensive network on support centers in India to repair and resell used computers.
We do believe that if we can provide a quality solution then we can see more customers walk into that, their willingness to try will be much higher and help drive better adoption. It will help acquire new customers, bring in first time buyers and over time they will buy a new computer, said Chandra.
HP Inc has a market share of about 32 percent in the PC segment in India as on June 30, 2018, according to IDC.
HP wants to target first-time buyers such as college students, customers from Tier 2 and 3 cities. It feels adoption of computers will accelerate in the future with broadband connectivity. It is a sizeable market. We just started to look at it. For informal players there are decent margins. It is an important market because it is serving a market we are not able to serve  providing products at a lower cost, he said.
He added the discussions were in initial stages and he did not have an elaborate strategy plan or business models to share at present.
Flipkart, which launched a separate site to sell refurbished electronics including computers, the market is expected to be a $20 billion market in 5-6 years.

## Title: Legacy of Huxley

Legacy of Huxley
Rereading a particular book that enticed a reader some year ago may be a fascinating adventure. I remember reading Aldous Huxley (1894  1963) novel Point Counter Point about fifty years ago, as it happened to be a work discussed at the time by a generation of book lovers of the time. The work, despite being bulky and 475 page-count with 37 chapters, is a readable narrative. It was one of the most amusing pieces of writing packed with the witty dialogue centred around a group of well to do people who constantly throw parties.
They discuss matters related to the postwar period of boredom and at times reach a climax in a theatrical scene. The group of people is portrayed as ironic in their behaviour patterns. Out of all these characters, a person known as Lord Edward entertains the rest of the guests who come to see him, as his wife Lady Edward, in the spacious hall in the great big mansion. As dialogue ensues, the reader sensitively captures the inner life of these characters that interact with each other.
Human expressionism
But Huxley does not try to write a murder story or a crime and mystery story. The intention is much of an elevated expression of human events. As such, the novelist Aldous Huxley in his expressions via his portraits, attempt to present humans certain dehumanized situations.
As English literary critics of the time point out the name of Aldous Huxley became popular from the late 1920s. As the critic Cyril Connolly pointed out, the creative success of Huxley rested on the witty, serious, observant, well read, sensitive, intelligent manner in which he expressed. There can have been few young writers as gifted as Huxley. The writer Huxley was educated at Eton and Balliol, and before devoting himself entirely to writing worked as a journalist and dramatic critic.
Apart from the novel, Point Counter Point, his work that came to be discussed in literary circles happened to be titled as Those Barren Leaves written in 1925. This too centres round an incongruous group fo people as observed living in social unrest. The background of the sophisticated novel is sunny Italy that was frequented by the writer D H Lawrence who wrote a book titled Twilight in Italy. The work of Huxley includes a poet who to earn living edits a little magazine titled as Rabbit Fanciers Gazette. As events move the reader feels that the poet is encountered by an amorist named Calmny. The poet unknowingly attempts to discuss matters with him resulting in the search for poetic material. It is recorded that Leonard Woolf, known to us for his work A Village in the Jungle, had written to the periodical known as Nation about the work that goes as it is brilliant and daring, admirably written humorously witty clever cultured.
Fantasy genre
In 1932, Huxleys turning point in writing career happened to be a novel titled Brave New World. This world is categorized into the genre of fantasy. Its impact on the modern world has been considerable though in context it did not embrace the science fiction type of narrative. The intention of Huxley seems to be an investigation into the future in order to show the reader the life of an oncoming future world thousands of years hence. I wonder whether Huxley, like HG Wells, attempted to predict the nature of the future human beings.
As noted, written in the 1930s, when  whatever the immediate outlook may have been  people believed that ultimately all would be for the best in the best of all possible worlds, this creative work perhaps a warning against such optimism. Huxley, drawing parallels from two human existences tries to satirise the lofty idea of human progress what we now discern as social development. He draws attention to views put forward by scientists and philosophers of his time.
Brave New World too happens to be an indication of the impending disasters of the new technologies. There are references to the test tube babies and several medical discoveries that had not been unheard of at the time of Huxleys creativity. In order to listen to various types of people living around the globe, Huxley admired travelling and keeping notes of his own thinking as the thought process of others. This resulted in a much-discussed travelogue, titled as Beyond the Mexique Bay written and published in 1934 as we see good travel books are scarce since they can be written by exceptional travellers.
Interesting travelogue
Huxley never attempts to write long descriptions. Instead, he had the cultivated habit of using the dialogue and situational events in his narrative line. As a reader, I found Huxleys travelogue resembling the work of Somerset Maughams Summing Up and A Writers Notebook that laid down the creative spirit and process of many a work of Maugham. Having had time to go through the work of Huxley, titled Eyeless in Gaza written in 1956, I felt that it is a mix of philosophy and creativity.
As observed by the biographer of Aldous Huxley, there had been quite a number of moments where he had been drawn to oriental religious prophecies. In this work, Huxley shows how spiritualism could bring about varying degrees of human thinking. The story that envelops the work tells of his successive attempts to find a satisfactory centre and meaning for his life and his eventual discovery that the real liberty he seeks is to be found through the discipline that leads to a wider spiritual conscience.
Perhaps Huxley had been constantly experimenting with spiritualism that he would be misunderstood for writing a work titled as Doors of Perception wherein he is depicted as using a certain mental stimulant, a plant named mescalin. As a reader, I just felt that herein lies the amalgamation of the spiritualist and the creator. He does not promote the use of drugs nor does he say that they should be totally prohibited. All that he says is the use of certain drugs could lead to the understanding of human thoughts.
Finally, I wish to pen a few views on his novel titled as After Many a Summer written in 1939. This narrative like his Brave New World depicts a kind of a fantastic parable. It looks as if Huxley had newly discovered the use of the age-old parable to see through the various nuances of human existence. The narrative rests partly in America and partly in England. A rich man is shown in the attempt to prolong his lifespan indefinitely. But how far he is successful is the vision embedded. The inner layer of this attempt visualizes that the man is given a specified period to lead a life. Huxley believed it is the pious (not his words) means of living helps an individual to reach longevity. The ultimate vision is the depiction of all good over evil defeats barriers to living. As critics have often pointed out the work treats of the ultimate topic of philosophy, bondage and liberation reality and illusion, the problem of good, the nature of evil.

Lesitha Prabath crowned 1st National Surfing Champ
Lesitha Prabath was crowned the first National Surfing Champion of Sri Lanka in Arugam Bay after two days of battling with his rivals at the inaugural National Surfing Championship Series 2018.
The 27-year-old from the Arugam Bay Surf Club had to overcome windy conditions and head high sets of waves but convinced the judges by showcasing strong skills of speed, power, flow and a solid aerial.
An aerial means the surfer flies through the air above the wave to land again and carry on the ride. This gave him the leading points above his fellow competitors, Parents Sadaruwan (2nd place) Asanka Sanjeewa (3rd place) and Nadeen Sampath (4th place).
Tim Jones, International Surfing Association advisor to the SFSL commented on the outstanding skills of the new National Champion: Lesitha probably had the most experience of anybody when it comes to contests. He has got solid, strong skills. He is also one of the few competitors that have an air game. In the finals his understanding of being safe in his surfing when he needed to and taking chances and risks in his surfing when it demanded he did so, was excellent".
The 3-round tournament was organised by the recently formed Surfing Federation of Sri Lanka (SFSL). In January 2018, Lesitha had already applied his winning formula at the start of the popular series in Hikkaduwa. Although Lesitha only made it into the semi-finals at the second competition in kabalana in March, he pushed hard to clinch the National title at his home-break.
For Lesitha it was a special moment in his life and a historical one for the whole nation.Of course it was my
dream to become the National Surfing Champion of Sri Lanka. I trained for it, whenever I had free time I came to Main Point".
Hiran Ukwatte, First President of the SFSL explained: Surfing as a sport has only very recently been introduced by the International Olympic committee to the Olympic Games. It will feature in the 2020 Olympic Games in Japan. In Sri Lanka, surfing was only considered a tourism develo pment activity, enough to get the tourists to visit the country. But when this Olympic moment came it laid the grounds to have a National level tournament for the first time in history".
"The recognition and preceding Surf series also allowed the SFSL to form Sri Lankas first National Surfing Team. Sandika Thushara, Event Director and First National team Manager led their members to the Covelong Surf Competition in India. Lesitha Prabaths victory scored him a place within the team.
I was very proud to take the newly-formed National team for the first time abroad to compete. It's the most valuable aspect for me to have them as one team. The Sri Lankan National team is very special, at high levels battling against competitors mainly from India, Bangladesh, France and Australia. I was very happy that all eight athletes made it into the Semi-finals and the Sri Lankans finishing 2nd, 3rd and 4th place. My experience at the contest also gave me inspirations and new ideas for our great event in Arugam Bay,making it more eventful and successful, said Sandika Thushara".
Tim Jones of the ISA added: "Surfing has many facets and sides. We intend to focus attention on high quality coaching for visitors to the island but very importantly for local surfers.
We have been introducing ISA instructor courses for Sri Lankans which mean they can develop in their surf clubs, the vital elements of junior and womens surfing as well".

LIFE SENTENCE FOR TERRORISM
The Government has proposed life imprisonment for the offence of terrorism if such act caused any other persons death under the new Counter Terrorism Bill gazetted last week.
This vital piece of legislation, which received conditional Cabinet approval early this month, will do away with the widely-objected Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1979.
The 88-page Bill is to make provisions for the protection of Sri Lanka and its people from acts of terrorism and other associated offences. It provides for the identification, apprehension, arrest, custody, detention, investigation, prosecution and punishment of any person who has committed an act of terrorism or any other associated offence.
It provides for the detection of terrorist acts and other offences associated with terrorism. The Bill has provisions to prevent terrorism and other associated offences committed within or outside Sri Lanka.It also prevents using Sri Lankas territory and its people for the preparation for terrorism outside Sri Lanka.
The preamble to the Bill states that the legislation is based on international norms and standards and domestic needs.
The provisions of the proposed legislation apply to any Sri Lankan citizen within or outside the countrys territory. It covers the territorial waters and the airspace of Sri Lanka, and the office premises of diplomatic missions in Sri Lanka including the residences of those diplomats.
The Bill says that the offences committed with the intention of intimidating a population, wrongfully or unlawfully compelling the Sri Lankan government, any other government, or an international organization, to do or to abstain from doing any act, preventing any such government from functioning or causing harm to the territorial integrity or sovereignty of Sri Lanka or any other sovereign country, are considered as acts of terrorism.
Identifying the need to deal with emerging cyber-terrorism risks, the Government has defined that causing obstruction or damage to, or interference with, any electronic, automated or computerised system or network or cyber environment of domains assigned to Sri Lanka including websites, as an act of terrorism if committed with the above mentioned intentions.
The Bill proposes life imprisonment for a person guilty of committing a terrorist act which caused the death of another person upon conviction by the High Court. If there had been no deaths, but still the act was aimed at killing another person, such person can be punished with imprisonment for a period which may extend to life imprisonment upon conviction by the High Court.
In addition to that, the court may order that all or any property of such person, be forfeited to the Republic.
As per the Bill, any person who attempts, abets or conspires to commit, an offence of terrorism is liable to imprisonment of a term not exceeding 15 years and to a fine not exceeding Rs 1 million.
The bill also states that a person could not be held in remand for more than 6 months without instituting criminal proceedings. However, the period of remand may be extended to a maximum of another six months on an order of a High Court Judge, on an application made by the Attorney General. The Magistrate can give conditional bail to the suspect if criminal proceedings are not instituted within 12 months.
According to the Bill, detention beyond two weeks is possible only with the approval of a Magistrate and no suspect shall be detained for more than two months under Detention Orders. The Police should notify the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka of the detention of suspects within 72 hours.The Magistrate, before whom a suspect has been produced and detained, and Human Rights Commission, can visit and interview the suspect and look into his well-being without giving any advance notice.
The draft law proposes to have day-to-day trials for cases filed under it.
Under the new law, the President can declare Curfew either to the entirety or part of Sri Lanka including its territorial waters and air space for the protection of national or public security from terrorism and other associated offences. The maximum period of any Curfew Order shall not exceed 24 hours at a time. A person, who willfully violates a Curfew Order, is liable to a fine not exceeding Rs 300,000.

LOST AMONG  RUINED CASTLES
I know that curiosity killed the cat but not the Welsh cat. Being curious is one thing; being investigative is another. Both activate the mind not forgetting the same applies to many species of the animal community, especially the street dog who has the natural instinct for it. They all have sharp minds.
Why do I say so
Because of my curiosity to explore the castles in Wales. The more I visit, the more they activate my mind.
There is so much of story, more mystery and history to dwell into which the Welsh give little significance.
They care less to visit apart from organized tours for ancient history. Yet, over the centuries they stand spectacular monuments to Welsh history and civilization. It is a must for anyone with a feel for history mainly for their architectural splendour. If I am to identify few among the massive ones strewn around, it will be the castle of Conway, Beaumaris, Cennen, Caerphilly, Pembroke etc.
Tudor Mansion
One castle that swept me off my feet was Laugharne, where history reveals to be an old one, fought for in the 12th and 13th centuries and presently incorporated into a Tudor Mansion and cited in Carmarthenshire 9 miles south-west of Carmarthen. This was repeatedly taken over by the Welsh.
Laugharne Castle has a history of constantly changing possession.
It was repeatedly taken by the Welsh and wrecked but many a time won back by the Normans. It was still changing hands in the second half of the 13th century and the first established ownership was that of Sir John Perrot during the reign of Henry VIII.
The medieval remains consist mainly of an early round keep and a round tower which was probably built around 13th century. The ruins of the gatehouse are also well preserved and date from soon after the tower.
It is a fascination to walk through this massive structure and get the feeling one is thrown back a couple of centuries to the past. There is movement inside as the wind passes through every possible passage creak even through laid bricks, take a turn to come back again. This keeps happening non-stop until dark when the wind or breeze relax and the trees around droop in sleep.
Yet, its original form is uncertain as the old castle was incorporated into construction as a mansion of some buildings by Sir John Perrot.
This castle with many had been so violently awakened after the inactivity of the 14th century, were repaired, and those lords who clearly saw the war clouds gathering over the houses of York and Lancaster looked to their walls and moats once again.
The Wars of Roses held interest for the great majority of the Welsh only because of a man who ended them, Henry Tudor claimant to the Duchy of Lancaster, born in Pembroke Castle. The Tudors came from Anglesey.
After generations, the Duke of Lancaster claimed the English throne to heal the rifts between York and Lancaster. Meanwhile, the Stuarts maintained the recognition that Wales had enjoyed from the Tudors when the Civil War broke out in 1642.
Wales was firmly Royalist and provided the breeding ground for Puritans and the Parliament.
Civil War
Many a castle explored and appeased my thirst and hundreds left behind the mystery of these castles lay hidden to be discovered (maybe when I visit again) is the end of a discovery in Wales.
It also reminds me of their Civil War and a period in the Tudor dynasty which naturally contended one for the Welsh written all over their castles.

Love-struck with Mercedes-Benz
The romantic aura of the city of love was unveiled in the Park Street Mews as DIMO organized an evening of romance with the state-of the art Mercedes-Benz CLS. Staged in the limelight of the stables at Park Street Mews, Mercedes-Benz CLS defined the exclusive theme of all Mercedes-Benz designs  Sensual Purity expressing Modern Luxury.

Commenting on the event, Rajeev Pandithage, General Manager for Mercedes-Benz of DIMO said We are happy to introduce the latest Mercedes-Benz CLS to Sri Lankan roads.
The Mercedes-Benz CLS comes with a peculiar design, aligning with the design philosophy of Mercedes-Benz- Sensual Purity and it addresses everyone who would love to set on road with a young passionate spirit. None of the cars in the market at the moment can compete with its design, capability and technology. And whats not to love in this sensual beauty
As the crowds of Colombo entered the stables of Park Street Mews, they were greeted with chocolate and ushered personally to an evening of music, wine and romance to experience the Mercedes Benz CLS.
While they enjoyed and experienced these romantic features of Mercedes -Benz CLS, 7 beautiful romantic songs of 80s were played to export the crowds into a nostalgic memory of pure and romantic love and exhibit a gist of the experience that Mercedes-Benz CLS will offer its fortunate owner. The event, delegated by some of the Colombos top icons from different industries, also included a karaoke session, and a Q and A session with many gifts to offer for the participants.
The participants were given the opportunity to experience the vehicle, know about the CLS and pose with props in front of the vehicle.
Launched internationally in April 2018, Mercedes-Benz CLS in its 3rd generation which as ever, sits on shared large Mercedes-Benz underpinnings, which means its able to offer all of the technology and all of the engines of the brand's other models. At 4.98m long, it is truly executive car-sized, and it is decorated with dashing frameless windows, and line less smooth edges that seamlessly add a touch of glamour.
The CLS's interior is constructed from top-class materials, and the fit and the finish is perfect. The driving position is perfectly placed; with a handy adjustable steering wheel with a funky touch-sensitive pad controls for some of the CLSs myriad safety and convenience features.
Chosen the right seat option, not just the seats are warmed, but also the doors and center console armrests are activated. The Mercedes-Benz CLS offers 12 exterior colors and 20 interior color variations of choices so that everyone has their own identity and choice mused with this romantic vehicle.
While its looks stunning to the eye, Mercedes-Benz CLS is an ultimate champion on the road, whether it's a long ride or a rough ride.
The energizing function is of the car is a highlight of its specifications, since it provides the rider with videos and instructions to relax and get comfortable in a long rough journey.
The engine is designed so as to provide a brisk, smooth and rewarding ride. The 450's engine has 362bhp, but thats boosted by an extra 21bhp thanks to an integrated starter motor/generator that sits on the back of the engine, between it and the standard nine-speed automatic gearbox.
This mild hybrid system is not just there to boost power, but also to make engine response better while you are waiting for the turbocharger to get going properly, and to handle the stop/start function smoothly.
The top AMG Line trim has air suspension, and they give the CLS a good ride quality, absorbing lumps and bumps effectively, while retaining excellent control of the cars body movements. The 18in wheels and winter tires, will offer a more absorbent ride. The international reviews so far mention that the CLS, for a car of its weight, is highly entertaining without sacrificing anything in the way of ride quality or refinement.
Diesel & Motor Engineering PLC (DIMO) as the local automotive pioneer and the sole authorized distributor for Mercedes-Benz in Sri Lanka has emerged as one of the most experienced and successful distributors in the South-East Asia region. The Mercedes-Benz CLS will be available at DIMO800 Mercedes-Benz Centre of Excellence for all the stylish riders who are always young at heart and romantic at spirit.

MAHANAMA, DISSANAYAKE GRANTED BAIL
The Presidents former Chief of Staff, I. H. K.Mahanama and former State Timber Corporation (STC) Chairman P. Dissanayake, were granted bail by Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake yesterday.
They were in remand custody on bribery charges, for over four months. They were released on Rs.100,000 cash bail and three sureties of Rs.2 million each.
The Magistrate stated that one of the sureties should be a close relative of the suspect.The Magistrate yesterday chided Bribery Commission officers for issuing a single certificate including the charges for both suspects. He said the two suspects had separate charges and therefore both should be issued with two separate certificates. Hence the certificate had no legitimacy, he said. He said Court will grant bail to the two suspects due to the defect in the certificate.
Investigations initiated with the complaint that Mahanama had demanded a bribe of Rs.540 million from an Indian investor who was ready to acquire a section of the Kantale Sugar Factory. Mahanama had been attending to this matter of settling the transaction sometime ago, while he was the Land Ministry Secretary. However, the Indian investor had refused to pay the sum stating that it was too high and demanded it be reduced.
Within several weeks, they had allegedly agreed to accept Rs.100 million.The two were arrested at a hotel car park in Colombo, on May 3, by Bribery Commission officers while accepting a bribe of Rs. 20 million.
Magistrate fixed inquiry for December 11.

Making captain the sacrificial lamb wont solve countrys cricketing ills
When the countrys cricket has fallen to its lowest depth as it has today somebody has to be thrown to the crocodiles and unfortunately and very unfairly it has been the captain of the side Angelo Mathews when the national selectors which includes the head coach who are facing the wrath of the public are getting away scot free.
Mathews is the sacrificial lamb in covering up of the real weaknesses in the system - lack of a proper administration in place and the national selection committee.
As Mathews says quite rightly in his letter that he has been made a scapegoat for Sri Lankas early exit from the Asia Cup.
To quote Mathews: Though I was initially surprised, it was immediately felt that I have been made the scapegoat in this entire saga of Sri Lankas dismal performances against Bangladesh and Afghanistan in the Asia Cup. Im willing to take part of the blame but at the same time, feel betrayed and let down if the blame is solely put on me. As you know all decisions are taken through a mutual understanding with the Selectors and the Head Coach. And though I do not agree with the reasoning that the losses should be accrued single handed to the Captaincy, I however eagerly and wholeheartedly respect the request of the selection committee and the head coach in asking me to step down and do so with immediate effect.
Chief selector Graeme Labrooy had made a statement to a Sunday newspaper where he very clearly states that the selectors had long discussions with the captain and the head coach and it was from their line of thinking that they agreed to the 16 which they believed was the best to win the Asia Cup. Without saying it in so many words what the chief selector was saying is that they picked the 16 which the head coach wanted.
Therein lies the problem of all what is happening today. Head coach Chandika Hathurusingha by taking over selections has created an untenable situation for himself similar to what happened to him with the Bangladesh side. He has recreated the situation where any which way you look at it the players are now revolting against the coach. By making the captain as the scapegoat these weaknesses are not going to disappear.
As a selection committee you dont call the captain and tell him to resign. If you are not happy with his performance you sack him.
Now that Mathews letter has become public in all fairness to the captain he has pointed out that the entire blame should not be pinned on him. That alone shows that he is not in agreement with the selectors on their decision.
In the first instance Mathews should never have been appointed captain after he resigned from the ODI series against Zimbabwe in July 2017.
But as he states in his letter: Thereafter, pursuant to Sri Lanka suffering heavy defeats in all formats and having several appointed Captains, namely Upul Tharanga, Thisara Perera, Chamara Kapugedara, Lasith Malinga and Dinesh Chandimal during the tenure between July 2017 and December 2017 in the ODI and T20 formats, Mr Chandika Hathurusingha immediately having been appointed as Head coach met with me in person, requested me to reconsider taking up the Captaincy until the World Cup in 2019. Though myself, my family and close friends discouraged me in taking up the mantle, being confident in Hathurusingha and his plans to elevate the performances of the Sri Lankan team and in the best interest of my country I agreed to do so until the World Cup.
Now it seems the faith in which Mathews had with the head coach who is also a selector has disappeared after the coach had sold him down the river.
The selection committee has to take full blame for appointing Mathews first of all as captain knowing well that he was half fit and that he was unable to bowl in the shorter format. They took a big gamble by appointing him and look whats happened.
Former captain Kumar Sangakkara also put his neck on the line by backing Hathurusingha and saying that Mathews is the key to Sri Lankas World Cup hopes in the ICC website. What has the legend got to say now
In all fairness ex-players have no business to comment on selections its unethical because you have a selection committee. If you dont agree with their policies objectively criticise them but you dont go around saying so and so must be the captain and so on and so forth. They are the ones who have created this situation with ex-SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala gullible enough to believe them.
All the wounds that Sri Lanka are facing today have become very objective ones and goes back to the sacking of the Kapila Wijegunawardene selection committee in March 2016. The moment the Sumathipala administration did that everybody lost faith in the whole system.
The Wijegunawardene selection committee had the temerity to appoint Dinesh Chandimal as the one-day captain for the World T20  a decision that was squashed by the Sumathipala administration by having that committee sacked and replaced by an adhoc selection committee headed by Aravinda de Silva and comprising Sangakkara, Kaluwitharana and Kaluperuma.
The Wijegunawardene committee appointed Chandimal because Lasith Malinga was unfit and so was Mathews. One of the biggest problems the head coach at the time Graham Ford had was that he had three captains during the Asia Cup. So to overcome that crisis Chandimal being the fittest was appointed captain. What happened was the De Silva committee came in and threw out the recommendation and gave the captaincy to Mathews and included Malinga who was not fit. They also brought in Lahiru Thirimanne and Suranga Lakmal who was not even in the nominated 25 squad in place of poor Niroshan Dickwella and Jeffrey Vandersay who were on their way to the airport when they were informed that they were not part of the squad.
When you behave in an unfair way even the gods have reason to punish you.
What we see today are the results of the wrong decisions taken.

New Era in Maldives
This is a moment of happiness, this is a moment of hope, this is a moment of history. This is how Maldives' Opposition candidate Ibrahim Mohamed Solih described his surprise victory at the Presidential Election on Sunday. In his own words, it was a a difficult journey - a journey that has led to a prison cell or years in exile, a journey that has ended at the ballot box because the people willed it.
In an almost surreal scene quite unthinkable until recently in this somewhat conservative nation of 400,000 people, supporters rushed to the streets of Mal, on Sunday night, waving yellow flags of his Democratic Party and chanting his nickname, Ibu, Ibu, Ibu. Solih, 54, studied in Australia, before working in media and being elected to Parliament from his home atoll of Faadhihpolhu at age 30. He also helped write a new constitution for the country.
Strongman President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom conceded defeat Monday on state television, amid earlier fears that he would not accept the election results. He has promised a smooth transition. Solih, a Member of Parliament, got 134,616 votes to the incumbent's 96,132, with almost 90 percent of eligible voters in the Maldives and overseas casting their votes.
This is indeed a historic turning point for the Maldives, Sri Lankas other closest neighbour after India. The two countries are physically and culturally close, with trade and socio-cultural links going back centuries. The two main languages Divehi and Sinhala have many similarities. There is a large Maldivian population in Sri Lanka and vice versa.
Most of the Maldives ruling elite and top intellectuals have studied in Colombo and many Maldivian politicians including former President Mohammed Nasheed, the first democratically elected leader of the Maldives, live in Colombo. Incidentally, Nasheed was among the first to praise Solih: You have done an extremely good service not only to the people of Maldives, but also to freedom loving people everywhere, the exiled leader said in a tweet. Democracy is a historical inevitability. Nasheed, who achieved worldwide fame for highlighting the effect of global warming on the archipelago, was imprisoned in 2015 on terrorism charges that his supporters say were spurious.
Sri Lanka, India and many other countries have welcomed news of the peaceful transition of power in the Maldives, hoping that it would bring much-needed stability and freedom to the tourist paradise at a juncture when the archipelago nation was feared to be veering towards authoritarianism. This will no doubt be welcomed by everyone, as the tiny nations image suffered for many years in the eyes of the International Community even after democratic rule was established in 2008.
Former President Yameen, who was elected in 2013, has been accused of jailing rivals and curtailing democratic freedoms. The country has been engulfed in a political crisis since he defied a Supreme Court verdict earlier this year that ordered the government to reinstate opposition MPs and release political prisoners. In February, he triggered worldwide condemnation by declaring a state of emergency and after his authorities arrested two Supreme Court Judges and Opposition Leader Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, his half-brother who also served as president from 1978 to 2008. Even on the night before polls opened, police raided Solih's campaign headquarters.
The new President is expected to stablise the political climate and realign the geopolitical imperatives of the Maldives, where the two regional powers India and China have maintained an active interest. China had increasingly invested in the Maldives in recent times. Major Chinese developments included an extension to the Velana (Hulhule) international airport and a bridge that connects it to the capital. India was among the first countries to congratulate the incoming leader, with a personal message from Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Solih will have his hands full from November 17, when he is expected to be sworn-in. Improving the battered image of the country and improving foreign relations will be a priority for Solih, said to be a master of negotiation and discussion instead of political rhetoric. One particular mission will be exploring the possibility of rejoining the Commonwealth, from which the Maldives withdrew from the UK in 2016 after the association of former British colonies threatened to suspend it for the alleged erosion of democratic institutions. He will also want to play a bigger role within SAARC, the South Asian bloc.
There is no doubt that relations between Sri Lanka and Maldives will improve by leaps and bounds under Solihs leadership. After all, Sri Lanka experienced a similar transformation led by democratic forces three years ago and the peoples of both countries share similar aspirations. As islands sharing the same ocean, they should engage in joint research on Climate change and environment. They should expand cooperation in the tourism sector, perhaps by publicizing two destinations together and even marketing Colombo and Male together to airlines looking for new routes. Both countries should strive to expand people-to-people contact, perhaps taking the Trans-Tasman Australia-New Zealand model as an example. The sky is the limit to a renewed Sri Lanka-Maldives partnership.

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has instructed the Ministry Secretary to suspend the salaries of all doctors and nurses who did not report to their respective service stations on transfer.
A Health Ministry spokesman said Senaratne had informed the Health Secretary to take disciplinary action against all Hospital Directors who do not release doctors and nurses who had received transfers. In addition, the funds given to their (Directors) hospitals for development activities will be halted and obtaining marks for their administrative skills when receiving promotions will also be affected if they do not release the relevant doctors and nurses who had received transfers.
During the recent Provincial Health Ministers Summit held in Colombo, all provincial health authorities spoke on the hardships faced by them due to lack of adequate health staff.
This was due to the doctors and nurses who had been transferred not accepting their transfers and not reporting to their due stations.
Minister Senaratne took the decision after considering this situation, he said.
He promised to provide a CT Scanner to every main hospital in each Province governed by the respective Provincial Council.
The Bandarawela District Hospital will be developed as a Base Hospital at a cost of Rs. 485 million with foreign aid, he added.

## Title: PUBLIC DEBT STOCK: A PUBLIC BURDEN OR A PUBLIC BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC FACTOR
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

PUBLIC DEBT STOCK: A PUBLIC BURDEN OR A PUBLIC BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC FACTOR
Public debt comes up for debate from time to time as part of a political subject although it has a wider coverage as an economic and social subject. In such debates, most analysts quote public debt level as a percentage of the countrys income, i.e., Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Some argue that the current level of debt around 78% of GDP (end of 2017) is too high. Some others argue that there are advanced countries with debt levels more than 100% and, therefore, Sri Lankas debt level is not alarming. Political analysts generally blame the previous government or the current government for raising the debt level. No one seems to question the Central Bank being the debt manager for the past 68 years whether the countrys debt is at a sustainable level.
Problem in Public Debt Numbers
The debt level is generally looked at as a comparative number, i.e., percentage of the countrys income, as the absolute debt number (Rs. 10.3 trillion as at end of 2017) is not generally meaningful to show its level. Although debt has been several times the governments annual total income (561% as at end of 2017), it is generally compared with the countrys income. The current debt level of 78% of GDP may mean that the government can pay-off all debt in full if the public is prepared to live with 22% of income in the year and pay the balance as tax to repay debt. However, it is a meaningless statement since nearly 46% of the public debt was foreign debt which required foreign exchange of nearly US$ 31 bn as at end of 2017 to repay such debt and the country is not able to buy such a volume of foreign exchange as compared to its total foreign reserve of US$ 8-9 bn.
Debt numbers have a lot of dark corners. In some years, the debt level rose even above 100% of GDP and the country has survived. Between 1987 and 2005, the debt level rose above 90% of GDP in all years except for one. The debt numbers also can be creatively managed by getting certain state corporations to borrow direct on government guarantees to finance public projects based on creative business justifications so that the government debt book is not directly affected. Debt data base and valuation are also complex stuffs. All foreign debt has to be revalued at the current exchange rates to know the actual size of tax burden to the public. In the case of non-market debt issuances, there is no way to know the actual financial receipt and cost of debt issuances.
The compilation of GDP also unreasonably impacts on the debt ratio. When the GDP estimation system is periodically updated on new production data base (new base years), the debt ratio immediately declines. An analyst who does not know such technicalities would look at the debt ratio and give comments favourable to debt management. In the same count, the comparison of the debt ratio with advanced economies is highly misleading as advanced economies can sell debts easily at low interest rates as their debts have an attractive global market as their currencies are global reserve currencies. In the last decade, these countries expanded their fiscal spending through debt as a standard economic policy to recover from the last global financial crisis.
Further, the public is not aware of any internal or external audit or internal controls and reporting systems on debt management in normal financial governance. It was recently revealed that issuances of Treasury bonds and Treasury bills which constituted nearly 43% of the reported debt stock as at end of 2017 have not been audited in the recent past.
Debt has various facets of business and economics. Therefore, rather than blaming the government for debt purely based on these dark numbers, we need to look into businesses and economic cases whether public debt profile is justified. As the public does not have information, policy-making officials could do it and advise the government and pubic on facts appropriately.
Business case for debt in general
Debt is a business factor in modern monetary economies with markets. Debt allows mobilization of savings to create production, income and employment through utilization of such savings. Almost all businesses are highly debt-financed. Most savers cannot do own businesses on self-savings as they are not entrepreneurs and, therefore, savings are marketed in modern economies. In business, debt is compared with own capital/savings, known as the leverage ratio (assets/capital ratio). The sustainability of the leverage level depends on the health and scale of the business and its cash flows (exiting and projected). Unless they speak for repayment of debt without causing problems to the business, there is no business case for debt as such debt will end up in a bubble and a burst one day causing a catastrophe or bankruptcy irrespective of the profile of the debtor and debt manager. If a business is financed through the roll-over of debt or debt trap where debt is repaid by issuance of new debt, the catastrophe is a matter of time because the business could be largely a Ponzi scheme or financial fraud.
A business case for public debt
The government has to provide the public service that serves as the foundation for the businesses of the country. Whether the public service is education or health service or law and order or regulation or state enterprises or social security, all are expected to promote economic activities and living standards of the public. Whatever policies the government takes will have an impact on its future finance as well as the rest of the country. Therefore, debt is always about business management in the future. Both debtor and debt manager have to live in future minds.
If the current cash flow of the government is not adequate to continue public service, the government has to borrow. All kinds of public service involve in public funds or government finance that decides the scale and the quality of the fiscal policy or the financial side of the government. If the cost incurred in providing public service (government expenditure) is greater than the price charged (the government revenue), there is a deficit in public funds that has to be financed by debt. In recent five years, annual government revenue or tax rate was 12% to 14% of GDP. In contrast, the total cost of public service was 17% to 20% of GDP. Accordingly, annual debt raised to fund the fiscal/cash flow deficit has been 5% to 6% of GDP. This has gone up in a wide range of 8% to 19% of GDP in 20 years during the past four decades.
The accumulated financial outcome of the fiscal cash flow deficits on public service is the public debt stock, 78% of GDP as at end of 2017, that should be repaid by the public, present and future. Since 1950, a cash flow surplus was reported only for two years, 1954 and 1955. When the public service is much more weighted for social safety than improvements to economys production capacity, the outcome will be more debt. In this background, debt service is mostly done by issuance of new debt and, therefore, the governments cash flow may not be a good business case to support the current debt level.
Looking for further business cases for public debt
Above cash flow numbers also are not realistic. Everybody knows that the government revenue is lower than the potential due to usual tax evasion while the cost is inflated than actual due to various dark corners of public service delivery system where state funds are leaked out to individuals without due utilization. Therefore, other business cases for debt must be explored.
First, physical infrastructures such as reservoirs, roads, ports and airports or state research and development or education and health for human resource development or state regulatory framework for healthy markets can be assessed against the debt and other funds utilized for those services. For this, we may prepare a list of such services along with cost, deliverables in form of certain output indicators and unit cost at least for high cost services. In the case of project-based debt, feasibility reports that lie in office stores can be assessed. In the case of international sovereign bonds, all bonds were issued to fund development projects and, therefore, listing of the development projects funded by sovereign bonds and their current business outcome would be useful. Almost all foreign debt has been approved by the Monetary Board independently from the debt manager duty of the Central Bank. This exercise will show whether the debt manager and the principal have performed for a business case.
Second, if the above business case is not strong, we can have a list of physical assets/properties of the government valued at current market prices and use it as the governments capital to argue on the accounting solvency of the government/public. If the government has assets more than the debt stock, it is solvent.
Looking for the macroeconomic case for public debt
We may also look at macroeconomic perspectives of public debt. First, fiscal deficit financed by debt is a text-book macroeconomic policy to promote income and employment opportunities. The fiscal stimulus in the developed countries to recover from the last global financial crisis 2007/09 still prevails.
Second, the public debt market sets the ground for the monetary and financial system. Government securities issued to finance fiscal deficits through debt are considered as safer and liquid investments as compared to private debt and equity. Central banks buy government securities to print money and drive the monetary policy. Interest rates on public debt provide the basis for interest rates to be charged from private borrowers, i.e., government debt interest rate plus a premium to bear higher risks of private borrowers. Accordingly, the yield curve or the series of interest rates across all maturities of government securities drives the financial markets. Investors buy government debt as a part of their investment portfolio to reduce risk profile. For this purpose, an active public debt market with transparency is vital for financial markets and economic activities. Benefits of market development by way of liquidity and price discovery are amply recognized in current economics.
Third, opening of public debt to foreign investments can increase the tapping of foreign savings to develop the market and to support the balance of payment deficits and foreign reserves in the event the private sector is not strong. Meanwhile, this will open up the countrys economy to known risks of international capital flows unless systems are in place to manage the risks.
We may assess whether the public debt has served above macroeconomic role. First, the government has been raising debt under-cover at forcefully low interest rates from state funds and administratively negotiated rates from private investors in the closed doors, both governments discipline in business debt and financial market development have been lost. Same time, when the dealers are funded by some other state funds, no market outreach, liquidity and price discovery can be expected. Therefore, there is no way for the government to know whether debt has been raised at possible lowest cost and risks although the debt manager may claim so. In the absence of audit and external scrutiny, dark corners of debt issuances and management can never be known easily.
Second, as debt is a business to a network of dealers and investors, market without transparency and standard infrastructure (trading platforms, securities depository, trade data and regulations) is an oasis for all sorts of insider dealings and market manipulations for their benefits. In this context, private debt and equity markets have not developed while the bank intermediation drives the financial system and real economy. Third, concentration in foreign debt and investments has exposed the economy to currency crises. For example, the current trend of capital flows has caused considerable risks to roll-over of existing foreign debt and foreign reserve of the country which can have contagion to other sectors of the economy. Therefore, the macroeconomic case for the public debt appears to be weak. However, the fiscal policy has a strong economic case until the private sector becomes strong to drive the economy through the market mechanism.
A reasonable alert to the way forward
Elected governments change from time to time due to wishes and beliefs of the majority public and, therefore, those who operate governments may not consistently follow up on debt numbers or any business and economic cases for debt outlined above. The fiscal catastrophes including debt defaults are reported from countries from time to time due to poor debt management not supported by strong business and economic cases. We must be mindful of post-mortems of those instances which are mostly similar as they will help us to improve the discipline in public service and debt management without waiting for disasters to happen and to blame other parts of the world.
For example, we now blame the US for the current currency depreciation problem. Relevant monetary policy authorities who had frequent missions to the US knew the planned and well-communicated policy of the US interest rate hikes from zero since 2015 towards normal interest rates (now projected to be around 3% to 3.25% in 2019/20) as part of normal monetary and business cycle. Still, the US policy interest rates have been raised only to 2%. As a result, foreign capital has begun to flow back to safer US investments with reasonably higher interest rates which has caused considerable depreciation of currencies of emerging market economies including Sri Lanka. This is to continue in next two years if the current US monetary policy and growth momentum prevail. International dealers and investors demand relatively higher interest rates from these economies if they are to retain capital. The public debt is the worst victim of this currency depreciation, given its high exposure to exchange rate and foreign investors and less preparedness.
Therefore, we need to stop blames and commence work now if we wish to prevent any burst of a possible debt bubble in future as Sri Lanka is not a country that can seek an international bailout on favourable terms, given its geo-political track record. In this regard, it is necessary to re-fix the public service delivery system, budget and debt management to create a strong business and economic case for debt to be fair by the countrys new generation who has to repay the existing debt stock.

Rupee depreciates with wrong economic strategies: Anura Kumara
The rupee depreciates because of the wrong economic strategies adapted by the government and the previous regimes, JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday said.
He was addressing the media at the JVP Headquarters.
The JVP leader said a long and short terms plan should be formulated to face the situation.We must have a long-term economic plan to prevent rupee depreciation. Unfortunately, present government has no whatsoever plan in this regard, he said.
He said the government and the previous government is directly responsible for the rupee depreciation.
The country suffers because of the wrong economic policies followed by the government and the previous regimes lead by former Presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Chandrika Kumaratunga, he said.
The American dollar is the standard unit of currency in the international markets. Therefore, the value of the dollar directly affects the economy of a country. Since we are in a global market, following an economic policy that neglects the international market is futile, he said.
Selling dollar-generating public institutions, disregarding production economy in the country, reducing exports mainly depreciated the rupee, he said.
The JVP Leader said the depreciation of rupee reflects the financial crisis in the country.

Shahzads blistering century highlights Afghanistans innings
DUBAI, Tuesday: Mohammad Shahzad the stocky Afghan opener had never scored a ODI century against an established Test side, but yesterday he put that record straight with a blistering innings of -124-- off 116 balls against defending Asia Cup champions India in a Super Four match played at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.
Coming to this game Shehzad had four ODI hundreds but against lesser strong opponents  Netherlands, Canada, Scotland and Zimbabwe but yesterday was a special day where he showcased his talent with aplomb to take Afghanistan to a total of -252 for 8-- against an India side that was sans many of its stars who were rested for this game.
The Afghan innings was entirely dominated by Shehzad whose batting resembled that of a modern day Duleep Mendis, the former Sri Lanka captain - stocky with powerful arms to execute sixes with panache. Shahzad gave one chance at 49 when Rayudu failed to hold the catch offered at mid-off off Kaul that saw him reach his half century off 37 balls. Then at 93 he won a review after he was given out caught behind off Khaleel when replays showed the ball coming off his shoulder. Nothing could deprive Shahzad from reaching his century which he did with a flick of his wrists to find the fine leg boundary for his tenth four in addition to hitting six sixes off the 88 balls he faced.
Shehzad dominated an opening stand of 65 with Javed Ahmadi whose contribution was a mere five runs off 30 balls. But once India broke through with Ravinda Jadeja having Ahmadi stumped by MS Dhoni the Afghanistan innings caved in as they lost four wickets for 17 runs.
Jadeja and leg-spinner Kuldeep Yadav caused the slide by picking up two wickets apiece as Afghanistan slumped from 65-0 to 82-4.
However a 50-run stand between Shahzad and Gulbadin Naib (15) lifted them to 132 before Naib was dismissed by debutant Chahar.
Dhoni taking over the leadership for this game  his 200th as ODI captain. India tested their bench strength by resting key players skipper Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah and Yuzvendera Chahal and giving a debut cap to 26-year-old right-arm medium-pacer Deepak Chahar.
By the way, Shahzad has gone past 100 Powerplay runs in the Asia Cup. Only Dhawan (117) has more
Shehzad reached his fifty off 37 bnakls off a dropped catch put down at mid off by Rayudu off Kaul. Shahzad was the key component in the opening stand of 65 with Ahmadi contributing 56 of it to his partners five off 30 balls.
Jadeja not only broke the partnership but he also sent back Rahmat Shah bowled for three, but the stocky Shehzad continued in his blistering form. More trouble was to follow in the form of leg-spinner Kuldeep Yadav who struck twice in succession in his second over to send back Hashmatullah and Asgar Afghan for ducks.
Afghanistan from a proimsing position of 65 for no loss slumped to 82-4 with the big hitting Shehzad plundering rusn from one end while wickets tumbled at the other.

Strategic development plan for domestic airports
The domestic airports at Ratmalana, Batticaloa, Palaly, Sigiriya, Koggala and Digana are to be developed as profitable airports by linking them into a streamlined Internal Air Traffic Service. A strategic plan for the development of these internal airports was discussed at a meeting held at the Transport Ministry auditorium chaired by Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva yesterday.
It was observed at this meeting that already 25 acres of land from the Ratmalana Airport premises has been obtained from the Sri Lanka Air Force which is using it to develop infrastructure facilities required for an internal air service. The Transport Ministry has agreed to pay Rs. 750 million to the Air Force for the development of infrastructure on this land, which would include aircraft hangars and terminals. Already the Ministry had paid an advance of Rs 250 million of the agreed amount to the Airforce.
Air Force officials who attended the meeting said steps would be taken to hand over this strip of land after the improvements, to Airport and Aviation Services Ltd, by December 31.
Minister de Silva directed officials to develop Ratmalana Airport and its infrastructure to service medium-size passenger planes and private jets. It was also disclosed that plans have been formulated to purchase new technological equipment for handling flight operations, building a new signal tower and an aircraft hangar.
The Minister also advised officials to call open bids to establish a private jet operations terminal at competitive prices. He also said urgent repairs would be performed to the Sigiriya Airport runway and the Koggala Airport runway.
It was also decided that development work on the Palaly Airport should not be handed over to a foreign country at any cost. Since the Civil Aviation Authority and Sri Lanka Tourism had agreed to fund the upgrade of the Palaly Airport runway to facilitate the landing of A320 aircraft, the Minister said immediate steps should be taken to commence development work after doing a feasibility study.
The Minister said that since the previous government started developing an airport at Digana and abandoned the work halfway after spending Rs. 197 million on it, a committee of intellectuals should be asked to study the project and report on its viability.
Following a discussion on problems confronting flight training schools, the Minister said obsolete flight regulations should be amended to streamline flight schools to enable them to compete with other flight schools in the region.
Noting that the heavy influx of tourists necessitated the development of domestic airline services, the Minister advised officials to commence domestic airport development initiatives during this year.

So, you want to start-up and develop a small business  Part 03
To succeed in your new small business, having a fantastic  idea is not enough!
As excited as you may be about a new business, its important to stay grounded and be realistic about it. You shouldnt have a Field of Dreams mentality when starting your business.
Just because you have a vision and decide to build it does not mean the rest will follow. While you may have an idea that is original, revolutionary or ahead of its time, there should be a real, solid market opportunity to ensure it is successful. Any new business case or new endeavour has to have a viable market that you believe you can sell now  not theoretically or on the premise that there is a future for this market.
Although your business niche and the idea behind your business are important, neither makes the primary difference when it comes to the survival of your business. Rather, the primary difference maker is you! The niche and the idea are only small parts of the puzzle that is success.
Puzzle pieces
Today, let us discuss a few of the most important puzzle pieces, including the cornerstone piece (that being you), and we will explain why you need to put them all together to ensure your businesss success. Actually, you dont need a new idea to be successful. Most small-business owners dive into their niches because they love the product or service they provide.
The history of small business is filled with stories of founders who cared so deeply about their product or service.that they subsequently decided to make it their lifes work.
Of course, the vast majority of small-business owners do not break new ground. However, they happily make a comfortable living by doing what many others before them have already done. Unfortunately, having a ground-breaking idea, extensive product knowledge, or unbridled enthusiasm has very little real influence on your long-term business success.
Even if you make the best Kavum, Kokis and Athirasa this side of Agnes Nona of Matara, your confectionary business could still crash and burn. Maybe you dont sell enough of them, or you have a hard time meeting the demand for the ones you do sell. Maybe you sell van loads of our traditional sweets but your prices are too low to make a profit, or your customers wont paytheir bills.
Important chores
Having a good product and knowing the product well are only the beginning of building a successful business; you must also perform a long list of sometimes arduous day-to-day chores to be a successful small-business owner.
Those chores may include the following: Find good customers and convince them to buy. Deal with difficult, hard-to-please customers. Provide cost-effective customer service that retains customer loyalty. Understand financial statements, including balance sheets, profit and loss statements, and cash flow statements. Grant credit to customers and know how to grant it. Collect receivables. Juggle and prioritize the payment of payables. Understand the mystifying concept of cash flow and then figure out how to manage it. Compute inventory turn, days-in-receivables, current ratios, andreturn on sales.
Learn how to use such management tools as organization charts, job descriptions, and performance reviews. Learn how to Collect and disburse tax and other central and provincial governments dues. Learn how to protect yourself from lawsuits - both from your employees and your customers
You need to know how to hire, train, motivate, and hold employees accountable; control expenses; manage crises; balance cultures; deal with bankers; budget; forecast - the list goes on and on.
(We will be discussing all those items in the coming weeks.)
Of course, not all small businesses have to deal with all the items in the preceding list. If your business doesnt have inventory, for example, you wont have to deal with the myriad issues relating to it. Our point here is that the niche or idea wont ultimately make or break your business; the day-to-day running of the business itself is what ultimately determines success - or failure.
Or stated another way, you show us a crackerjack business person, and well show you someone who can get rich in the traditional sweets and confectionaries business whether or not he or she personally has the foggiest idea about how to bake anyone of those things.
Choosing your business
Finding the right business to buy or start can be a bit stressful, but you dont need to be worried about it. This series of articles will offer plenty of help to assist you in matching your skills, interests, and job history with a suitable business, and they will also help you select the niche that works best for you, given who you are, what you like to do, and what youre capable of doing.
Consider your category
Before you decide which business-venture would be best for you, you need to understand the four major business categories that you can consider:
Retailing, service, manufacturing, and wholesaling.
Let us talk about some important characteristics you need to know about these four categories:
Retailing: Retailing is the general category that most people are familiar with because the typical Sri Lankan deals with at least one retailer every day. Since most people are familiar with the retail business, the learning curve is usually much easier in retailing than in the other three categories. Also, because most retail businesses deal primarily with cash or near- cash equivalents (credit cards), funding requirements for accounts receivable are relatively low compared with some of the other business categories. That means, in turn, that the capital requirements for entry can be comparatively low, depending on how much inventory is required.
E-commerce (retailing over the Internet) is changing the parameters of the retailing category. The barrier to entry in retail-oriented entrepreneurial endeavours is becoming smaller as some successful retailing entrepreneurs choose web pages over storefronts. However, success online isnt as easy or as lucrative as some would have you believe.
Service: The service industry is the fastest growing of the four categories, in part due to the low cost of entry. You typically need no significant inventory outlays and minimal equipment. Additionally, if youre among the increasing number of service providers who choose to work out of their homes, occupancy expenses are relatively low and tax advantages are a potential perk.
Manufacturing: Save up your hard-earned cash if youre thinking of becoming a manufacturer; this category is a veritable cash-guzzling machine. Inventory, accounts receivable, equipment, physical plant, employees - you name the cash-draining asset, and most manufacturers will have it. Although manufacturing is typically the most expensive of the four categories in terms of entry-level capital requirements, it offers great potential for rewards.
Look at the high-tech industry for examples of wealth being created (not just for the founders but for key employees as well) in short periods of time; companies such as Microsoft, Intel, and Apple were start-up manufacturers not that long ago.
Wholesaling: The middleman in capitalisms distribution channel, wholesalers act as intermediaries between manufacturers and retailers or consumers. The wholesalers role is to buy large quantities of products at discounted prices (discounted from retail prices that is) from manufacturers, break them down into smaller quantities, and sell them at a mark-up to retailers or consumers.
Like manufacturers, wholesalers require significant cash outlays for inventory, receivables, physical plant, and employees; thus, the start-up capital requirements for wholesalers are correspondingly high.
Accidental opportunities
Many small-business owners are accidental entrepreneurs - that is, they stumble on a good business to start or buy. Maybe a favourite retail store suddenly comes up for sale, or a friend informs them of a cant-miss opportunity, or a customer of the business theyre working for now invites them to do some freelance consulting - an invitation that turns into a business opportunity.
In these cases, the lucky entrepreneur doesnt set out to own a business. Instead, he or she stumbles on the right opportunity. As with so many other directions people take in life, the time and the place just happen to be right. When considering your accidental opportunity, if you dont enjoy what youre about to do, your chances for success willdecrease. Make sure that your accidental opportunity is in a niche that you like.
Melissa Kieling is one such accidental entrepreneur. Single mom-turned businesswoman, Kieling founded PackIt, which makes foldable, freezable lunch bags and has been named one of the fastest growing privately held companies.
Kieling has said she started PackIt at her kitchen table after years of searching for ways to keep the fresh healthy lunches she packed for her kids from turning to tepid mush by lunchtime. Today, she has become the youngest self-made woman to make the Forbes Billionaire list.
Jan Koum, young man in Ukraine migrated to US at end of 90s. He has a large circle of friends in Ukraine and had a constant unmet need of communicating with them. He created WhatsApp to do so and the company was formed two years later. eBay and Facebook founders are also accidental entrepreneurs.
Inventory of yourself
Make an Inventoryof your skills, interests, and job history
Most people arent lucky or fortunate enough to stumble upon the right business. And the kinds of people who discover the right business are often those who are willing to go to a lot of trouble to find good opportunities. If the perfect business opportunity doesnt just fall into your lap (and, actually, even if it does), you need to do some introspection to determine what type of business is right for you.
There are a number of questions which can help you take an inventory of your business expertise and interests. (You can get a piece of paper and treat these questions like a quiz if you want to.) The answers you get will help you select the best possible business opportunity for you. We will go through them next week.

Thiruketheeswaram excavated
Earlier during the prehistoric period, Thiruketheeswaram temple was called Mahathuvadapuri. With the passage of time, it was named Matota. But later Matota was known as Mantota. Yet the Sinhalese called it Mahatitta. It was generally believed that before the arrival of King Vijaya in the 5th century A.D, numerous trading activities took place between India and Lanka.
It is worthwhile to note that numerous references have been made about the historical developments. Another historical reference reveals that in the 4th century A.D, the sacred tooth relic was brought from Kalinga Desha to protect it from hostile forces.
Portuguese historian Do Couto mentioned that during an excavation project in 1575, the workers found a chain under a foundation. It was made out of iron. He further said that such type of chain was not seen anywhere else even in India.
Pali Dathavamsa
The bearer of the Sacred Tooth Relic landed at Mathota and spent the night at a Hindu temple. It was generally believed that the above mentioned Hindu temple must be Thiruketheeswaram. But the name of the temple was not at all mentioned anywhere else in the history. However, it is worthy of mentioning here that Pali Dathavamsa did not directly mention the name of the port where the bearer landed with the Sacred Tooth Relic. It is simply mentioned as Lankapatuna.
Portuguese capture
Another important evidence regarding this temple could be found in Sambavakkurippu by Vishvanartha Sastriyar of Jaffna. He mentions how the temple area was engulfed by the sea on numerous occasions. In 1540 the sea caused damage to the temple. According to him, the poojas continued till 1589. The historical evidence further proves that the Portuguese captured Mannar in 1591. As soon as they captured Mannar, they built the Mannar fort. The Portuguese conquered the Jaffna kingdom in 1591. The ancient Thiruketheeswaram temple was demolished in 1591 A.D. As soon as the friars saw the valuable Hindu images, they buried them within their church premises.
The Portuguese needed a bell for their newly built church in Mannar. They did not have any metal to make it. They asked the local people to find a metal for the bell. And they were informed that in lieu they would be given clothing. A few days after the announcement, somebody informed them that a piece of metal was found on the surface of the ground. When the ground was dug they found nearly 18 pieces of different images of deities. Out of the valuable treasure, they made the bell.
Mahadevan Kovil
An inscription found in Mathodam indicated that another temple named Thiruvirameswara Udaiya Mahadevan Kovil had existed in the past. It was further learnt that Rajendra1, made an endowment to the temple. During the period, Thiruketheeswaram was named as Mahadevan Kovil by the Chola regime and Mathodam was named Rajarajeswaram. The Chola regime occupied Sri Lanka during the 10th and 11th century A.D. During this period Thiruketheeswaram temple was maintained well and the port city was beautifully preserved. According to a Chiddambaram inscription in the 13th century, the Thiruketheeswaram was built by a Pandyan king known as Sundara Pandyan 1 in typical Pandyan style.
In the 19th century, an eminent scholar indicated that in the city of Manthai numerous Romanian coins of different periods specimen of pottery and gold and silver chains were found. The original temple site was razed to the ground. All the valuables of the temple belongings were buried including the ancient Siva Lingam. During the period the coastal towns were robbed by pirates. Once even Kanniya Kumari temple was robbed. In Sri Lanka in 1847 Javanese also pirated one of the Hindu temples in Thambalagamam.
After a few decades, the Archaeological Commissioner the late E.M. Hocart made a massive excavation on Manthai and the surrounding areas in between 1925 and 1928. He found a handful of findings. Again in 1950 numerous excavations projects were carried out. From the earlier excavation, valuable materials were found.
Different countries
The interesting materials including a variety of pottery that belonged to different countries, such as China, Rome and Arabian were found. Former Archaeological Department head Sanmuganathan began the excavations in 1950, but unfortunately, he passed away.
In 1950 some of his works were published. According to him when Anuradhapura was the capital Manthai was one of the important ports. One of the historical facts indicates that the city was encircled by a parapet wall and a ditch around a fortification. Periodically numerous excavations had taken place in Manthai.
It is stated that initial excavations took place 1rom 1887 to 1928. Even the 7th-century Tamil hymns of Saiva saints, especially Thirugnansamanthar and Suntheramoorthy Nayanar beautifully mention Thiruketheeswaram.
Again another excavation took place on the 18th of April 1950. It revealed a 40 feet Eastern pathway. Besides this, another parallel narrow pathway was also found. Moreover a few decades ago a big Sivalingam was found in the close vicinity surrounded by centuries-old buildings.

## Title: Trump expects second Kim summit soon

Trump expects second Kim summit soon
UN: US President Donald Trump said Monday he expects to hold a second summit soon with Kim Jong Un, lauding the North Korean strongman at the United Nations as terrific one year after he eviscerated him from the same platform.
Trump used his debut address to the UN General Assembly 12 months ago to threaten to totally destroy North Korea and belittled its leader as rocket man, prompting Kim to respond by calling the US president mentally deranged.
But returning to New York for this years gathering, Trump hailed tremendous progress to halt Pyongyangs nuclear and ballistic missile tests and said that a year later it was a much different time.
Chairman Kim has been really very open and terrific, frankly, and I think he wants to see something happen, Trump said after meeting South Korean President Moon Jae-in, a dove who recently visited Kim in Pyongyang.
I think within a fairly short period of time that (summit) will be announced. It will be at a location to be determined but were both very much looking forward to having it.
Trump, who met Kim in Singapore in June in the first-ever summit between the two countries that have never signed a peace treaty, earlier told reporters that he appreciated a beautiful letter the young North Korean leader had sent to him.
While relations with Kim have improved dramatically, leaders attending the annual assembly expect this year to hear Trump espouse a hard line on a different US adversary, Irans Hassan Rouhani.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo -- who has visited Pyongyang three times -- will preside over a Security Council meeting Thursday to explain the administrations imposition of sanctions on North Korea, which has hit Chinese and Russian companies.
Skepticism remains about whether Kim has taken any concrete steps, but that seems unlikely to deter Trump from pushing toward a new summit in what he considers a key foreign policy achievement.
In his 41-minute speech at the General Assembly in 2017, Trump made clear he wanted to turn the clock back on the last half-centurys growth of global rules and institutions and to return to the primacy of the nation-state.
His national security adviser, John Bolton, said that Trump would stress defense of US sovereignty in his latest UN address on Tuesday.
The UNs number one financial backer, the United States has moved under Trump to cut funding to the world body, notably to peacekeeping missions that are key to the UNs goal of promoting peace and security. The United Nations has tremendous potential and that potential is being met, slowly but surely, Trump told a meeting on combatting drugs attended by UN chief Antonio Guterres.
While Trump will dial down the rhetoric against Kim, there seems to be little prospect of him doing likewise with Rouhani.
The United States annoyed many of its allies in Europe by pulling out of a deal they jointly negotiated in 2015 that lifted sanctions against Tehran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program.
US allies in the Middle East, notably Saudi Arabia, have, however, been delighted by Trumps stance. Bolton said the United States was seeking to ramp up pressure on Iran but not to overthrow the regime -- an idea he supported before taking his job and reiterated recently by former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is Trumps personal lawyer.
As I have said repeatedly, regime change in Iran is not the administrations policy, Bolton told reporters.
Weve imposed very stringent sanctions on Iran, more are coming, and what we expect from Iran is massive changes in their behavior, he said.
On Wednesday, Trump will for the first time chair a Security Council meeting on non-proliferation that will focus heavily on Iran, likely triggering a clash with other big powers.
The White House has not closed the door on a Rouhani-Trump meeting. But Rouhani, in an interview with NBC News after arriving in New York, saw such an offer as hypocritical.
Naturally, if someone is keen on having a meeting and holding dialogue and creating progress in relationships, that person would not use the tool of sanctions and threats (and bring) to bear all of its power against another government and nation, Rouhani said.
Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Monday accused US allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates of supporting Arab separatists allegedly behind an attack on a military parade last week that killed 24 people. - AFP

Trump vows U.S. first at U.N.
UN: US President Donald Trump on Tuesday urged heavy pressure both on Iran and Washington's trading partners as he offered a robust defense of the US right to go it alone.
Addressing world leaders at the start of the annual United Nations General Assembly, Trump lashed out at the OPEC oil cartel, China's trade policies and the International Criminal Court which he vowed the United States would never accept.
Hours before Iranian President Hassan Rouhani took the same rostrum, Trump denounced the clerical regime as sowing chaos, death and destruction and doubled down on the US withdrawal of an international agreement on curbing Tehran's nuclear program.
But the real estate mogul turned populist leader was comparatively subdued a year after he stunned the global body with his bellicose language on North Korea, including a threat to totally destroy Kim Jong Un's state.
This time around, Trump heralded his own diplomacy on North Korea including a historic summit in June with Kim, saying he has worked to replace the specter of conflict with a bold and new push for peace. With midterm elections in the United States little more than a month away, Trump's address at times took on the feel of a campaign address as he heralded low unemployment.
A day after the European Union announced a new legal framework in hopes that companies can keep doing business with Iran and evade incoming US sanctions, Trump demanded that all countries take aim at Tehran -- and noted that his decision has been popular among the Shiite-majority nation's Sunni Arab rivals.
Trump robustly attacked the globalist view of the world -- shared by many at the United Nations and on the political left in the United States -- and vowed: America will never apologize for protecting its citizens. He said that the UN-backed International Criminal Court has no jurisdiction, no legitimacy and no authority. His national security adviser John Bolton earlier went so far as to threaten to prosecute judges from the court in The Hague if they take up accusations against US forces in Afghanistan.
We will never surrender America's sovereignty to an unelected, unaccountable global bureaucracy. America is governed by Americans, Trump said.
Amid a growing trade war with China, Trump said that the commercial imbalance with the Asian power cannot be tolerated and reserved harsh words for OPEC, the global oil cartel that includes both US allies and foes.
OPEC and OPEC nations are, as usual, ripping off the rest of the world, and I don't like it. Nobody should like it.  - AFP

They say the tank has been neglected for a long period and is in a dilapidated stage. Human activities too have contributed immensely for the plight.
The villagers said that when the Kesbewa, Kaluthara road was widened a few years ago, the contractors diverted the rodd drainage to the tank and sediments flow into the tank reducing its capacity. One side of the tank is grown with wood.
A villager Gamini Silva said people coming in vehicles throw their garbage into the tank causing an environmental hazard.
Another villager Samith Jayage said some drink alcohol in the surrounding area of the tank. What they do under influence of liquor affect the beauty of the tank. Some throw plastic, polythene they bring in the catchment area while some dash the glass bottles on stones, she said.

If designed and run well can cushion blow of unexpected losses
WB appraises Lankas disaster  respond initiatives
Sri Lanka has put in place extensive programs to respond to disasters. While the government and development partners are now increasingly able to forecast disasters and provide immediate assistance to those affected, more can be done to coordinate these efforts and ensure that disaster-affected households are supported until they fully recover, Dr. Idah Pswarayi-Riddihough, World Bank (WB) Country Director for Sri Lanka and the Maldives said.
This is where adaptive social protection can play a role. Adaptive social protection comprises a series of measures to protect the poor and the vulnerable from disasters. These are measures to become more resilient as communities. Adaptive social protection is not just about money it is also about social assistance and services, such as cash transfers, social insurance, like pensions and disability benefits; and active labor market programs. If they are designed and run well, these programs can cushion the blow of unexpected losses such as those brought about by disasters, she told a conference on Adaptive Social Protection in Sri Lanka: Building Resilience to Disasters and Climate Change in Colombo yesterday.
It was a forum to learn, discuss, and envision a future in which no-one needs fear falling into poverty as the result of a disaster. Information systems are playing an increasingly pivotal role worldwide in directing and coordinating governments responses to those in need. With support from the World Bank, Sri Lanka is developing a social registry, which is a database containing details on the needs and conditions of citizens. Currently there are 35 programs implemented by 11 ministries, each with its own rules and processes and no coordination, reducing their impact and efficiency. A social registry can help various programs to determine who needs the most help in a systematic and objective way. The social registry can play a key role in responding to disasters too, by helping the government and other agencies to identify who is affected, what their needs are, and what programs they already receive. The Country Director added, Sri Lanka is visited annually by natural disasters. Both 2016 and 2017 saw severe floods and droughts. According to a recent World Bank report launched last week in Colombo, rising temperatures and changing monsoon rainfall patterns from climate change could cost Sri Lanka 7 percent of GDP and depress the living standards of nearly half the countrys population by 2050. These events have an enormous impact on those who are directly affected, and the impacts are felt indirectly by all of us. We estimate that 5.7% of the population is at risk of falling into poverty if a shock reduced their income by 20%. By taking lives, destroying assets and interrupting business activities, disasters are quite capable of adding measurably to the number of poor.Several country representatives were to share the knowledge on how they have taken on this challenge, using increasingly sophisticated social registry and welfare systems to provide rapid assistance to disaster-affected citizens during the two day conference to be concluded today. Likewise, Sri Lanka will also be able to lead the way for other countries by sharing its experiences developing and implementing a truly adaptive social protection system in the years to come, Dr. Pswarayi-Riddihough said.
The event was sponsored by the French Development Agency (Agence Franaise de Dveloppement) and the Rapid Social Response Trust Fund (financed by the governments of the Russian Federation, Norway, the United Kingdom, Australia and Sweden, and the GFDRR (Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction) and hosted by the Department of National Planning.

World Cup heroes Jayasuriya, De Silva concerned about Lankan cricket future
With over 1200 runs, Sanath Jayasuriya is still the highest run-getter in Asia Cup. Currently in the UAE as a member of the tournament technical committee, Jayasuriya couldnt hide his disappointment at Sri Lankas early exit.
It is very painful to see the current status. There is no pride in our cricket at the moment. When you lose, you are under pressure, but you should be able to absorb it. I am not too sure that is happening. This is the best time to come out of it because it cannot get worse than this, said Jayasuriya.
I am shocked at how they have got some of the basics wrong. Running between the wickets looks awful. Theres no trust among the batsmen. Aravinda and I used simply make eye-contact and run without even calling, he said.
A huge concern is that the guys who get starts are not able to finish things off. Batsmen like Rohit Sharma and Shoaib Malik have shown in this tournament how it should be done. We are going to face a huge crisis moving forward unless we fix the issues. Only eight teams will play the Champions Trophy and only 10 teams will play the World Cup. We are going to miss out in future if we are not going to sort these issues. Some of the younger cricketing nations have shown professionalism. We cannot take anyone lightly these days. Smaller teams are getting more exposure and they are a threat, he said.
At the moment we look below par in all three departments and our fitness is a huge concern for me, said the former captain.Former skipper Aravinda de Silva echoed Jayasuriyas sentiments and said Sri Lanka have got their strategies wrong after the former champions made a humiliating exit in the Asia Cup. Sri Lanka suffered defeats at the hands of Bangladesh and Afghanistan inside three days to crash out, ending their worst Asia Cup campaign.
Losing is part of the game, but the sad part is that we havent got our strategies sorted out. They have no idea what they are doing. There is no proper direction and clarity. The batting is a mess. We have to set each batsman a role and set the batting line-up accordingly. They are still continuing trial and error which is dangerous considering the World Cup is nine months away, said de Silva.
I am appalled with our fielding. That is not excusable. It has got nothing to do with talent. It is mainly hard work. I am not too sure whether they are placing enough emphasis on fielding. They are carrying a few older players and those players need to be positioned in certain areas and work on that. By now it should have happened, he said.
I also see that they are opening with Kusal Mendis. Well, I am not too sure whether he is an opener. His technique and temperament are such that he is better off at number four. Kusal is a guy who has got all the shots and should play the anchor. They need to understand his strength and strategise accordingly.
I am glad that Lasith Malinga has returned to the side and that has given some variation to the attack. We have to analyse properly and make some decisions moving forward, said Aravinda.  Hindustan Times
