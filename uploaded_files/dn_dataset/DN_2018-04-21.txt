74th Bradby 1st leg - who will emerge victorious
The most sought after rugby possession in the school arena, the Bradby Shield encounter between Trinity College Lions and Royal College Elephants 1st leg is today in what promises to be an entertaining affair at Royal Complex. This is one of the most looked forward Schools rugby encounters, since 1920. The shield was introduced in 1945, and out of the 73 Bradby games Trinity has 39 wins, Royal 32 and 2 tied. Today much will depend on the performance of experienced players of the two teams, from whom much will be expected to take on a leading role from their starting line-up. Although this is not Trinitys strongest side, they will not lack motivation for this match after they suffered two rare defeats.
They will also be keen to get the better of their opponents, which will be a difficult one. Royal is playing good quality rugby and playing as a team. They have become worthy winners against whomever they have played. The Bradby game however always turns out to be extraordinary as over the years these games have been very much a carnival atmosphere with both present and old boys gathering to rejoice and go down memory lane.

Amendment entitles women to 84 days maternity leave
The Government has amended the law lifting hitherto prevailed restrictions on maternity leave for women with two or more children.
The new amendments to the law make all women entitled to 84 days of maternity leave irrespective of the number of children they have.
As per the existing law, women with two or more children are only entitled to 42 days maternity leave whereas women who give birth to their first and second child get 84 days maternity leave.
The Labour, Trade Union Relations and Sabaragamuwa Development Ministry has gazetted two Amendment Bills to the Maternity Benefits Ordinance (Chapter 140) and the Shop and Office Employees (Regulation of Employment and Remuneration) Act (Chapter 129) on Wednesday, to grant 84 days of maternity leave for every woman who give birth to a live child.
Out of the 12 weeks of maternity leave, the woman can utilize two weeks leave prior to her confinement.
If she worked any number of days during the last two weeks before her confinement, she can utilize such leave with the rest of 10 weeks leave immediately after her confinement.
If the confinement does not result in a live child, the woman will receive 42 days maternity leave. Out of that she can utilize two weeks leave prior to her confinement.
Maternity leave is paid leave given in addition to holidays and other annual leave an employee is entitled to.
The two Bills will be presented in Parliament for its First Reading at a future date.

Armstrong in $5m settlement for US fraud case
Los Angeles, Friday: Lance Armstrong has agreed to pay $5 million in order to settle the looming federal fraud case stemming from his drug-fuelled reign as king of the Tour de France, it was confirmed on Thursday.
The former cycling superstar was due to face a trial next month over claims he defrauded the US government when he doped while racing for his United States Postal Service-sponsored team.
The Postal Service and former team-mate Floyd Landis had sought around $100 million in damages from Armstrong in the case, which was due to get under way on May 7.
However the prospect of a potentially ruinous judgement going against the cancer survivor was averted after Armstrongs lawyers and the US Justice Department brokered a settlement.
No one is above the law, US Justice Department lawyer Chad Readler said in a statement announcing the deal. This settlement demonstrates that those who cheat the government will be held accountable.
Armstrongs attorney Elliot Peters said in a statement the settlement ends all litigation against Armstrong related to his 2013 admission that during his career as a professional cyclist he had used performance enhancing substances.
The Washington Post reported Armstrong will also pay $1.65 million to cover the legal costs of former team-mate and whistleblower Landis. A further $1.1 million of the $5 million amount will go to Landis.
I am glad to resolve this case and move forward with my life, Armstrong, 46, said in a statement.
Im looking forward to devoting myself to the many great things in my life  my five kids, my wife, my podcast, several exciting writing and film projects, my work as a cancer survivor, and my passion for sports and competition. There is a lot to look forward to.
Although Armstrong maintained the US Postal case was without merit and unfair he said he was pleased to have settled.
I have since 2013 tried to take full responsibility for my mistakes, and make amends wherever possible, he said, reflecting with pride on his performances in a US Postal jersey.
I rode my heart out for the Postal cycling team, and was always especially proud to wear the red, white and blue eagle on my chest when competing in the Tour de France. Those memories are very real and mean a lot to me.
Landis meanwhile told ESPN he was relieved not to have to confront Armstrong in a courtroom battle.
I really didnt want to relive it in a courtroom, and I dont think Lance did either, and I dont know that that would have really accomplished anything, Landis said.
Rather than going through that humiliation again, were better off. I mean, it was up to Lance, but I think he probably feels the same way.
However the settlement was greeted with dismay by Betsy Andreu, the wife of former Armstrong team-mate Frankie Andreu. The Andreus were among the first to go on the record about Armstrongs doping.
Betsy Andreu said the settlement amounted to Armstrong being let off the hook.
My thought is a vengeful, unremorseful pathological liar was revealed and got a lifetime ban so all is not lost, Andreu wrote on Facebook. in the end he is who he is and money cant buy class, respect or reputation.
Armstrongs personal fortune had been estimated at around $125 million in 2012.
But since his dramatic fall, he has lost lucrative sponsorship deals and in 2015 was ordered to pay back $10 million in bonus payments given to him by Dallas-based SCA Promotions relating to his Tour wins in 2002, 2003, and 2004.
The Washington Post reported he had recently listed his home in Austin, Texas for sale at $7.5 million.
The fallen US cycling star had battled back from cancer to win cyclings most prestigious race, the Tour de France, a record seven consecutive times between 1999 and 2005.
Although rumours of drug use swirled around Armstrong throughout his career, he never failed a test.
However his reputation imploded when the United States Anti-Doping Agency wrapped up an investigation which concluded he had been at the heart of a sophisticated doping program throughout his career. Armstrong later confessed to using performance-enhancing drugs and was banned from all competitions for life and stripped of his seven Tour titles. AFP

## Title: Ball-tampering row: How does it work and what effect does it have

Ball-tampering row: How does it work and what effect does it have
Ball-tampering. Its been discussed constantly in the past few days - but what does it actually mean
Australias Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft admitted to a pre-meditated plan to tamper with the ball during the third Test against South Africa.
But what is the benefit of tampering with a cricket ball
FIRST THINGS FIRST - WHAT DOES REVERSE SWING MEAN
There are two types of swing. Conventional swing is when a bowler uses the polished side to get the ball to move one way.
With a Kookaburra ball, which is used often in South Africa and Australia, quite often the shine doesnt last very long, which is when bowlers look for reverse swing.
The key to finding reverse swing is to get one side of the ball as pitted and scuffed as possible - and kept scrupulously dry.
This creates extensive turbulence around the rough side, forcing the ball against its natural swing path, which is why its known as reverse swing.
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE BALL REVERSE SWINGS
Pakistan great Imran Khan was the first person I met who demonstrated to me - in the nets, one might add - how to tamper with the ball.
He got hold of an old ball from the coachs bag, prised up the quarter seam on the rougher side - the quarter seam is the join at right angles to the main seam - and the ball swung like a boomerang.
Occasionally in matches when there was absolutely nothing happening, I tried this - totally against the laws of the game, of course - but nothing happened. Or, if it did, I wasnt good enough to exploit it.
CAN A BALL BE ROUGHED UP NATURALLY
Bowling cross-seam deliveries to land the ball on the leather, or bouncing it in from the boundary, has no guarantee of damaging the same side of the ball.
So, bowlers and fielders are tempted to try illegitimate measures.
This could be accidentally-on-purpose stepping on the ball, scratching it surreptitiously using finger nails, bottle tops, sandpaper stitched into trousers or even, on one occasion, a pen knife.
The best legal method of ball-tampering, when you desperately need wickets Put on a bad spinner.
A couple of clonks for six into concrete stands would produce just the right sort of damage to the ball that the ailing quick bowlers need. That is, as long as it isnt hit so far that its lost.
BUT IF A BALL GETS NATURALLY ROUGHED UP, HOW DO YOU TELL IF ITS BEEN TAMPERED WITH
In the late 1990s, when reverse swing with an old ball gained prominence, some bowlers became quite proficient at mimicking or enhancing natural scuffs or scratches on the rough side with their finger or thumb nails.
Provided they didnt get caught, it was very hard to detect the difference between a natural scratch and a man-made one.
I inspected the ball used by Pakistan in the 2006 Oval Test that the umpires examined and declared had been tampered with, which ultimately caused the Test to be abandoned.
I defended the bowlers from any illegal interference - I felt there was no way to be certain that the scratches and striations on the ball were not the natural result of the ball landing on the abrasive Oval surface, and no one had been caught on camera doing anything suspicious.
WOULD AUSTRALIAS ATTEMPTS HAVE WORKED
It is hard to see how some soil accumulating on a piece of tape and subtly rubbed on the ball would have any significant effect on the behaviour of the ball.
It certainly wasnt worth the risk, as the Australians have painfully discovered.
IS BALL-TAMPERING EASY TO GET AWAY WITH
I think Australia were deluded. It is almost impossible to get away with any of this in international cricket now. There are 30 cameras watching you and umpires regularly inspecting the ball.
Theres always been skulduggery in cricket but its always had this status as a sport where people behave well and respect each other.  BBC
Pakistan great Imran Khan took 362 Test wickets at an average of 22.81

Buddha statues floating off Trincomalee sea found
Several colourful Buddha statues, including other sculptures, which were reportedly on a canoe floating in the sea about 250 nautical miles away from Trincomalee, were spotted and brought ashore by a group of fishermen from Galle.
The fishermen had been on a multi-day fishing mission onboard the trawler Veenavee 1 which left the Galle Fishery Harbour about a month ago. The fishermen, who took the figures onboard their trawler, despatched them to Magalle Kachchiwatte Ancient Temple in Galle and subsequently deposited there.
Among the floating figurines were three statues of Arhat Seevali, a figure of a deity, and a brightly decked out princess mounted on horseback, all 7 in number.
Seevali is an Arhat widely venerated among Theravada Buddhists. He is respected as the Arhat of travel and is believed to ward off misfortunes at homes such as fire or theft.
Magalle Kachchiwatte Ancient Temple Chief Incumbent Ven. Uluwitike Bodhiseeha Thera on examining the statues said the figures might have been sent from Myanmar as there is a religious festival there in which Arhat Seevali is honoured with rituals and the figures are kept on open boats and floated in the sea.

The Mattala International Airport (MIA) has earned over Rs. 14 million revenue for two days from the landing of the largest cargo aircraft of the world belonging to Russia at the airport, MIA Manager Upul Kalansuriya said.
The aircraft arrived at the MIA from Malaysia on April 18 at 6.35 a.m. and departed at 4.45 a.m. yesterday to the Karachchi International Airport.
Kalansuriya said arrivals of such aircraft in Sri Lanka could bring in a good income to the country. The aircraft landed in Mattala to refuel and have a rest for its crew. The 24-member crew was welcomed at the airport with a tea party that Kalansuriya arranged.
Chief pilot of the Antano 225 aircraft Antanov Dmytro said they decided to land in Mattala since the aircraft required a massive space.
The MIA boasts of required facilities and space for landing large aircraft.
Kalansuriya said the chief pilot told him that the aircraft will land at the MIA in future as well.

Chelsea keep Champions League hopes alive at Burnley
London, Thursday: Chelsea manager Antonio Conte defended misfiring striker Alvaro Morata despite the Spaniard missing a host of chances in a 2-1 win at Burnley on Thursday.
Victory kept Chelsea's outside chances of chasing down Tottenham Hotspur for a place in next season's Champions League alive as they closed to within five points their London rivals with four games remaining.
Chelsea meet Southampton for the second time in eight days in a FA Cup semi-final on Sunday after Conte's side came from 2-0 down to win 3-2 at St. Mary's on Saturday.
And with the Cup representing Chelsea's last chance at silverware this season, the Italian left Eden Hazard and Willian on the bench as Olivier Giroud and Morata started together up front for the first time.
Morata has still only scored twice in 2018 after missing two one-on-ones with England World Cup hopeful Nick Pope.
But Conte believes the Spaniard showed he and Giroud can work more often as a partnership.
"This is a really good option," said Conte. "In the past it was very difficult for me to try this option with the two strikers but they showed a great link and a great combination and at the same time they worked very hard for the team."
Burnley's opening day 3-2 win at Stamford Bridge was an early indicator as to how the season would develop for both sides with Sean Dyche's side now dreaming of qualifying for European competition for the first time since 1967.
However, Burnley's hopes of leapfrogging Arsenal into sixth were dealt a blow by a first defeat in seven games. AFP

Cricket Australia to name Lehmann replacement in 'coming weeks'
Sydney, Friday: Cricket Australia said Friday a decision on who will replace national coach Darren Lehmann will be made "in coming weeks".
The CA Board met and discussed the process through which a new coach, as well as the captain and deputy of the men's one-day team will be named prior to the team's tour to England in early June.
Board chairman David Peever said recommendations for preferred candidates for the leadership positions will be ratified before being publicly announced.
"The Board has asked management to provide recommendations regarding candidates for the men's head coach, ODI captain and ODI vice-captain," Peever said in a statement.
"The Board is anticipating receiving these recommendations in the coming weeks, with a view to making appointments ahead of the ODI tour to the UK.
"Once these appointments have been endorsed and finalised, announcements can then be made."
Wicketkeeper Tim Paine has been confirmed as Test captain for the immediate future, however his involvement in the five ODI and one T20I England campaign remains unclear.
Former Test players Justin Langer, Jason Gillespie and Ricky Ponting have all been linked as potential candidates to replace Lehmann.
The 12-month suspensions of former captain Steve Smith and his deputy David Warner in the wake of the ball-tampering scandal in Cape Town last month, coupled with the resignation of Lehmann as coach, has prompted the need for the radical leadership revamp in Australian cricket.
It also led CA to commission an independent review into cultural, organisational and governance issues in cricket following the Cape Town incident. AFP

Dhanasiri Weerasinghe a key figure in the controversy spills the beans after 50 years
The cricket tour that never took place but changed national selection policy
It is fifty years since Sri Lanka first attempted a full cricket tour of England, that failed to materialize for several reasons. Many are of the view had that tour taken place in the summer of 1968, Sri Lanka would not have to wait to gain Test status for as long as 1981 but become a full member of the ICC much earlier.
To understand the reasons behind why the tour failed to take place one has to delve into the background of how it first came about.
Soon after Ceylon (as it was known then) was admitted to the Imperial Cricket Conference (now known as International Cricket Council) as an associate member in 1965, SC Billy Griffith, then secretary of the MCC and manager of the MCC team that toured Australia and made a visit to Ceylon in 1965 offered to host the Ceylon team for a tour of England in 1968. However Griffith stressed that the tour was not to be considered as an admission to Test status but a stepping stone to that higher status, an opportunity for Ceylon to learn to play longer hours, over a greater number of days. The MCC arranged for Ceylon to play against 12 counties, two universities, MCC, Scotland and Ireland  a tight schedule of 15 first-class 3-day matches and some minor games during a two-month tour.

The tour ran into difficulties even before it had started over funds. The Sri Lanka Cricket Board did not have the wherewithal to undertake a tour of such magnitude and they appealed for funds. THE FIRST TO RESPOND TO THE CALL FOR DONATIONS WAS THE ASSOCIATED NEWSPAPERS OF CEYLON LIMITED (ANCL) WHO MADE A CONTRIBUTION OF RS. 3000. Others took the cue and followed afterwards. However it was not because of the lack of funds that the tour failed to materialize but over team selection!
Dhanasiri Weerasinghe who was a central figure in the team selection controversy was good enough to roll back the years and recall in detail what actually took place and how the tour eventually came to be cancelled. Weerasinghe, a former Ceylon captain and chairman of selectors was in Sri Lanka recently on holiday and took time to speak to the Daily News about the pandemonium that reigned during that time which put back the progress of the countrys cricket by at least a decade.
Relating what took place Weerasinghe now in his eighties (he is 82) said, What actually happened then was, for a number of years nobody from Galle, Panadura, Kurunegala, Kandy, Ananda College, Nalanda College or any other schools could play for Sri Lanka. With FC Derek de Saram in charge, they would always select the Thomians and Royalists, the Josephians and the Peterites and we would get no chance whatsoever. There was an outcry from the clubs that we had to change this method of selection and eventually they did. Sam Abeysekera who was a Thomian and a national selector was the one who really started the ball rolling by saying, Dhanasiri this has to stop. Everybody who comes from anywhere should play for Sri Lanka and therefore all the clubs backed us. They also said, Peter May and Colin Cowdrey as selectors had been picked to play for England as selectors so you as selectors could also pick yourselves if you were good enough. We were good enough at that time and we decided to select ourselves. Only Chandra Schaafter (a national selector) stood in our way. He walked out and created all the issues and the papers were dead against us, so was Robert Senanayake (who was then Cricket Board president).
The Ceylon team selected for the tour was:
* Dr Herbert IK Fernando (captain)
* Michael Tissera (vice-captain)
* Stanley Jayasinghe
* Dhanasiri Weerasinghe
* Abu Fuard
* Anuruddha Polonowita
* Tikiri Banda Kehelgamuwa
* Daya Sahabandu
* Dr Buddy Reid
* Anura Tennekoon
* Ranjith Fernando
* Dan Piachaud
* Mano Ponniah
* Gamini Goonesena
Standbys: Sarath Wimalaratne, Nihal Samarasekera, Lionel Fernando, David Heyn.
Dan Piachaud, Gamini Goonesena and Mano Ponniah who were already in England playing for the counties and university were invited to join the team.
The four-member selection committee comprised: Dhanasiri Weerasinghe (chairman), Dr HIK Fernando, Sam Abeysekera and Chandra Schaafter.
DUDLEY REFUSES BROTHER ROBERTS REQUEST
Speaking further Weerasinghe who was employed in the Police Force said, The Sports Minister was VA Sugathadasa and I was the Ministers security. He knew everything that was going on. Robert came to him and said, You know Sugathe there is so much media reports about the selectors selecting themselves and all, we must cancel the tour. The Minister said, As the Minister of Sport if you as president of the cricket association tell me I will do that and he cancelled the tour.

A week later, Robert turns up and says to the Minister that Dusty Miller (who represented Ceylon at the ICC) had got 15 tickets and whether a Presidents XI can be sent to England. Sugathadasa told him, Look I am the Minister and I cancelled the tour, I cant ask a Presidents XI to tour it must be a Sri Lankan XI that should tour why dont you speak to your brother (Dudley Senanayake) who is the Prime Minister and get it okayed. But Dudley refused.
Gamini Goonesena was invited by us to be player-manager of the team so that he could manage and advise the team. Anyway Gamini also turned against us. But Sugathadasa stood by us. Calling off the 1968 tour came about purely because we changed the team policy.
PI Pieris, Neil Chanmugam and the crowd we dropped them and made room for others so they all rose up in arms. Without any doubt the tour cancellation was the opening of doors for cricketers from other schools and clubs to gain selection to the national team, Weerasinghe stated.
HAVE YOU BROUGHT YOUR SARONG WITH YOU
The selectors even went to the extent of demoting Michael Tissera (who had then won two unofficial tests against Pakistan and India) to the role of vice-captain. Weerasinghe however had his reasons for doing so.
When CI Gunasekara finished captaining in 1962 Michael had come into the team and Derek picked him as captain straight away when it should have gone to HIK who was the next senior player. Thats what made us all angry not with Michael but the manner in which the appointment was made. Michael was a good captain, a lovely player and nobody had anything against him. At that time we thought the right thing should have been done by appointing HIK. That was how HIK was picked to captain the 1968 team to England, explained Weerasinghe.
You know that when Polonowita when he first went to play for the SSC, Derek de Saram asked him whether he had brought his sarong with him. It was that sort of attitude that we had to live with. It was the time when the brown sahibs ran the show and you couldnt blame them for it. During that time a player like (Lasith) Malinga would have never played for Sri Lanka, Derek would have cancelled him straightaway, Weerasinghe said.
Weerasinghe, a product of St Johns College, Panadura and Ananda College had to pay a heavy price for the role he played in the selection.
The next year when the State Bank of India team came to Sri Lanka the team that we had picked for England was chosen to play against them except for me. I was dropped continuously for about 2 to 3 years but I continued to play and I scored runs so they couldnt ignore but pick me. The reason for not picking me was because of the England tour cancellation, recalled Weerasinghe, an aggressive right-hand bat, leg-spin bowler and outstanding fielder.
Suddenly one day I get a call from DD Jayasinghe (chairman of selectors) who had replaced us. He said, Dhanasiri I am at a board meeting I want you to come because we are choosing you as the captain for the South Indian tour (Gopalan Trophy). So I turned up and we chose the team. There was an issue about HIK Fernando as I wanted him as vice captain. HIK said that he will play under anybody for the country. I won the Gopalan Trophy against Madras (now Chennai) and the papers had to write good things about us. I retired immediately after that.
BEST INNINGS
It was on that tour that Weerasinghe played the best innings of his career for Sri Lanka.
I would rate the 94 I scored at Chepauk as my best innings because it was made against Venkatraghavan, VV Kumar and Satwender Singh. You know what the wickets are like in India, turners. That was I thought quite an exceptional innings by me especially being captain.
Weerasinghe also scored a pleasing 43 in Sri Lankas first ever limited overs international win over the MCC at the P Sara Oval in 1969, sharing a second wicket stand of 64 with Anura Tennekoon (42).
These are things that happen in life I am not angry with anyone. I still have very cordial relationships with Michael (Tissera), Fitzroy Crozier and all the Reid brothers in Australia, they are very close friends. The fight was they realised that everything went according to their plans and we couldnt get a foot in. When it all changed they used to call us Maradana boys and various things like that. PI became a very close friend even though I dropped him from the team to England. Every time he came to Australia we had lunch together.
Born on September 8, 1935 in Panadura, Weerasinghe played in the first eleven team for St Johns College Panadura at the age of 13 in 1949 as a leg-spin bowler. He came to Ananda College the following year and played for the first eleven as a leg-spin bowler and went in as the last batsman.
I travelled to Ananda College by train from Panadura as my mother who was from Nuwara Eliya and father from Baddegama had settled down there. I played for Ananda from 1951 to 1955 captaining in my final year. That year I was selected as the best all rounder Ceylon Schools by the Times of Ceylon and Ananda was the champion school team, said Weerasinghe. I left college after 1955 and played one year for Panadura SC in the Daily News trophy scoring two hundreds and a 90 then I came to Bloomfield. Thats where I started playing Sara trophy division I cricket. From 1958 onwards I played for Ceylon in almost every game till I retired at the age of 35.
MIGRATION TO AUSTRALIA
Weerasinghe recalled the hard times cricketers of his era had to undergo unlike in todays context where they are awfully rich.
There was a lot of hardship in the sense there wasnt a lot of money. We had to come from outstation every day for practice. It wasnt easy but there were a lot of people who helped Sri Lanka cricket at the time and we just got used to that kind of life, recollected Weerasinghe.
The government wouldnt give you money to take out of the country. So we had to go and sell our bats in India to get some money to buy our wife a saree or clothes for yourself, it was really tough. But we were young, we were happy and we managed somehow unlike today, where these guys walk around with millions in their pockets.
The grounds for Weerasinghe moving with his family to Australia was also because of the sanctions imposed on the people by the government at the time.
I migrated in 1975. My wife and I decided to go there because of my children (3 daughters aged 5, 6 and 7). During that time Mrs (Sirimavo) Bandaranaike said that we cannot send our children overseas to study in English. So we decided to retire. My wife had a senior internship in Monash University in Melbourne so we took that opportunity and went there. Since then my three daughters have done very well, one is a lawyer, the other a doctor and the third a chartered accountant. They are all married to professional Australian boys. I have 4 grand children one of whom became the champion in age 14 group rhythmic gymnastics in Australia. She just missed being selected to the Commonwealth Games this time, said Weerasinghe.
I have lived happily in Australia but never forgotten my motherland I used to always follow the cricket throughout and I think at the moment we are having one of the best batting sides, the most talented batting side in international cricket. We dont have to worry too much about the talent we have it will do us good for the next five years if properly guided.
They say (Chandika) Hathurusingha is good but I dont know him personally. They talk very highly of him maybe he can put things into order. I think we are on the right track at the moment. I dont know much about officialdom in the Cricket Board but we seem to have a lot of talent. We have more talent that even Australia.
There is money in the game now and that allows them to perform better than they would normally do, so that they can earn a little extra money. I personally think they should often have grass on wickets like at the CCC and NCC so that our boys can get used to the swing and the swerve and also some turning wickets. That is where skill comes in. Otherwise on flat pitches you and I can also score runs.
That is what is happening today everyone goes and plays their shots whereas in our time at 11 in the morning you get an off spinner turning the ball onto your face and we also had some good swing bowlers like (Malcolm) Spittel. We had to get used to all that. All batsmen should be technically sound first so that their talent can then be extended in more useful ways, Weerasinghe said.
Winding off on a sincere note Weerasinghe said, Had that tour to England in 1968 taken place we would have got Test status long before 1981. We were very good in the sixties and our teams were extremely strong. It is the ICC and England who kept us away because there is a lot of politics. I would still say maybe in my own selection I would have refused being chairman and on hindsight have accepted that but thats life.

Dimitrov sees off Goffin to reach Monte Carlo semi-finals
Monte Carlo, Friday: Grigor Dimitrov benefited from a second-set collapse by David Goffin on Friday to reach the Monte Carlo Masters semi-finals for the first time with a 6-4, 7-6 (7/5) victory.
The 26-year-old Bulgarian got the better of a nervy Goffin in a repeat of last year's ATP Tour Finals final to book a last-four clash with either defending champion Rafael Nadal or Austrian Dominic Thiem.
"I felt like I could have done things a bit better, especially at the beginning of the second set," said Dimitrov.
"Hopefully in my next match I can do better in those moments.
"The pair will team up later on Friday in the doubles quarter-finals, but there was little charity on offer from Dimitrov towards his partner turned opponent. Dimitrov has struggled on clay in the past and has never passed the French Open third round, but he was too strong for sixth seed Goffin in the Monaco sunshine.
Fourth seed Dimitrov edged a tight opening set after failing to serve for it as Goffin produced a poor service game at 5-4 down, before the Belgian recovered to race into a 5-1 lead in the second.
But Goffin wasted three set points on his own serve as he tightened up on the most important points, and Dimitrov broke twice to force a tie-break.
The world number five wrapped up victory in the breaker on his second match point to claim one of the best wins of his career on clay. AFP

Does the Commonwealth Games have a future
GOLD COAST - The Commonwealth Games could hardly have been held in a more idyllic setting.
Australias Gold Coast, a city of never-ending golden beaches and sunshine has welcomed visitors from all over the world. This was a multi-sport event in Queensland, a state whose mantra is: beautiful one day, perfect the next.
Big sporting events such as these are never perfect and Gold Coast 2018 concluded on a sour note, with organizers criticized for not using the athletes as the center piece of the closing ceremony.
Many on social media were aghast that broadcasters did not show the athletes entering the stadium, as is often the custom at such ceremonies.
Australians in particular were irked that they did not get to watch celebrated wheelchair racer Kurt Fearnley, winner of the T54 marathon gold that morning, carry the flag, while athletes were seen leaving Carara Stadium early.
Presenters on Channel Seven, Australias host broadcaster, addressed the viewers at the end of the two-and-a-half-hour finale to share their disappointment.
Im furious, said host Johanna Griggs, telling viewers it was not Channel Sevens decision not to show the athletes enter the stadium.
It will be an ongoing furore.
During the 11-day event there were also complaints from restauranteurs about a downturn in profits, while taxi drivers also talked of a reduction in income. As the Commonwealth flew into the city, the natives appeared to flock out.
But has the Gold Coast Games made an often-criticized international event more relevant
A GAMES WITH A SOCIAL CONSCIENCE
The Games are regarded by some as an enduring reminder of British imperialism. After all, it is a competition comprising of 71 nations and territories which once formed part of the British Empire.
Aware that perceptions must change if this event, which is in its ninth decade, is to thrive, the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) has used Gold Coast 2018 -- held on a floodplain which was once home to various Indigenous families -- to promote social change.
Weve gone through a journey in the past several years, David Grevemberg, CGF chief executive, tells CNN Sport.
Weve been soul searching about our narrative -- who are we and what do we want to be.
The Delhi 2010 Commonwealth Games was one of the low points in the history of the event. Engulfed by controversy, there were criticisms about spending millions on a sporting event in a country with extreme poverty. There were also construction delays, infrastructure problems and poor ticket sales.
Post-Delhi a lot of soul searching was done, in terms of the relevance of the Commonwealths and the Games, Grevemberg says.
For Grevemberg the future of the Games lies in talking about the Commonwealths colonial past.
What weve tried to do is use the platform of a major Games to create a safe place for courageous conversations and bold action, says the Louisiana native who lives in Scotland and works in London.
The platform of the Games, on the Gold Coast, on the land of Indigenous people, with the whole public discourse of reconciliation in Australia -- why would we take the opportunity to miss the opportunity, particularly knowing where the Commonwealth has come from. Its like walking into a room full of elephants and pretending theyre not there.
We have to be bigger than that, be better than that, if we truly want to have the impact we want.
We all have this history, its what we do with it.
By attacking some of these issues straight on, by creating a willingness to listen to people, we really can change the dial. If you havent created a strong granite foundation for all people, itll always be a fragile base.
PROTESTS, CONFRONTING THE PAST
The Games opening ceremony focused much on Australias Indigenous culture. It was a reminder that the host nations past did not begin some 200 years ago with colonial rule.
There was backlash -- mainly from those complaining about too much Indigenous content -- but Grevemberg has since said he would not change a thing.
Though there was little controversy surrounding these Games leading up to the closing ceremony, there were nevertheless protests.
An Aboriginal group set up camp on the Gold Coast, a continuation of demonstrations from the Melbourne Commonwealth Games in 2006 and the rallies of the 1982 Games in Brisbane.
There were demonstrations during the Queens Baton relay and before the opening ceremony, with protestors wanting to draw international attention to Australias colonial history and the social injustices its First Nations peoples still experience.
On basic standards of living, from health to education and employment, Australias Indigenous population is being left behind. Life expectancy is lower, while infant mortality rates and maternal mortality is far higher than that of the general population.
Theres a lot of work to be done. I know Australia has a lot of discussion right now and a broader debate on racism, says Grevemberg of the protests.
Theres a lot of work to be done. People who have felt trauma and anger from the past, to give people the opportunity to express themselves in a peaceful manner is very reflective of the modern Commonwealth.
Will the Commonwealth Games continue to make a difference on the Gold Coast once the grandstands have been dismantled and the focused switched to Birmingham in 2022
In 2015, 71 territories unanimously agreed to a new vision of the organization, put it on the line that we want to build peaceful, sustainable, and prosperous communities globally, not just the Commonwealth, says Grevemberg.
We want to be a trailblazer that can influence other countries and nations worldwide.
Theres various degrees of discourse and turbulence out there, but we want to be the consistent beacon for these types of conversations and, more importantly, action.
The CGF has yet to provide CNN with requested details of how many members of the Indigenous population have worked at the Games.
We will be taking the lessons learned from here and instigating a number of initiatives with Indigenous communities across the Commonwealth in terms of discourse and discussion in how we establish a declaration in Indigenous reconciliation through sport, added Grevemberg.
One of the things weve already done in our host city contract, for 2022 and beyond, is that if you do host the Commonwealth Games theres a requirement that you promote and respect Indigenous people. Its obligatory. Thats putting our money where our mouth is, so to speak.
TOO COSTLY TO HOST
The question many ask, however is: who can afford to host the Games
Come 2022, five of the last six Games will have been hosted in either the UK or Australia, two of the worlds most affluent nations.
Durban -- which was set to become the first African city to host an event which was first held in 1930 -- was stripped of its right to hold the Games in four years time as the South African city did not meet the criteria set by the CGF.
Few rushed to replace Durban as hosts, with the English city of Birmingham eventually winning the bid.
Hosting the Games will not come cheaply for Englands second most populous city, with the projected overall cost of the Games running to a reported $1 billion.
Ten of the top 20 emerging cities are in the Commonwealth so there s huge opportunities there, said Grevemberg of potential future hosts.
Were no longer the men and women of Del Monte coming to inspect the fruit and acting as auditor general.
Were now actually partners with cities and working in tandem with them to reduce costs and make the Games more affordable and amplify the value of the event.
We brought Glasgow 2014 in 37m [$53.7m] below budget and that wasnt by accident.
Cities wanting to host a Games which has a social conscience -- transgender weightlifter Lauren Hubbard was supported by the Federation, while Gold Coast 2018 was the first multi-discipline sport event to award an equal number of medals to men and women -- will also be obliged to uphold the United Nations guiding principles on human rights.
Englands diver Tom Daley made a plea for 37 competing nations that sill criminalize homosexuality to relax their anti-gay laws. Cities will not be prevented from bidding, but they may be required to adapt and change if their bids are to succeed.
DO MAJOR STARS STILL CHERISH THE COMMONWEALTHS
There is also the issue of whether the worlds biggest stars regard the Commonwealth Games as a priority in an increasingly crammed sporting calendar.
Canadas Andre de Grasse, 200m silver and 100m bronze Olympic medalist, widely regarded as Usain Bolts heir apparent, was missing as he wanted to be ready for a strong and full outdoor season.
Kenyas 800m world record holder David Rudisha and two-time 1500m Olympic champion Asbel Kiprop were also absent, as were their countrys elite marathon runners.
Injury prevented cycling great Mark Cavendish, Australian favorite Sally Pearson and Olympic 400m champion Wayde van Niekerk from competing.
Because of the timing of this event in the southern hemisphere -- its the start of the season in the northern hemisphere -- there is difficulty, but youve got the top netball teams, Rugby Sevens teams, says Grevemberg.
Its the beginning of the season and thats something, as we move forward, we need to take that into account to optimize the timing.
Do we run it in October, September to synchronize better with the athletes scheduling
Im very happy with the number of athletes. Im really confident that what weve started here is something that can continue to manifest into our youth games and into Birmingham 2022. - CNN

Ex-batsman Smith named as new England cricket selector
London,Friday: Former Test batsman Ed Smith has been appointed as England's new national selector, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced Friday.
The ECB said Smith, who succeeds James Whitaker, would be part of a "new approach to scouting, assessing and selecting players for the senior men's Test, T20 and one-day sides, ensuring greater connection right through the international pathway".
Smith, who had been a cricket writer and broadcaster, said: "I'm delighted to take on the role of national selector. I was very happy with what I was doing previously but the chance to be at the forefront of this development in English cricket was too good an opportunity to turn down."
The 40-year-old Smith, who has a first-class history degree from Cambridge University, has written approvingly of the 'Moneyball' approach to recruitment that has revolutionised the process of talent identification in major North American sports. AFP

Factory EPL suspended
The Environmental Protection Licence (EPL) of the Horana rubber factory was temporarily suspended by the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) yesterday.
CEA Director General Hemantha Jayasinghe said the decision was taken pending a full-scale inquiry into the incident on Thursday.
After this inquiry, we will determine whether to cancel the EPL permanently or to restore it, he told the Daily News.
He said the decision to temporarily suspend the EPL was after studying the investigation report prepared by the Kalutara District CEA Office, adding that the official letter informing the decision would be sent to the factory on Monday.
Five persons died after inhaling a toxic gas generated in a waste water treatment plant of the factory on Thursday and Police arrested the factory manager following the incident.
The factory had been closed for five days, may be due to Avurudu holidays. When the worker opened the valve of the anaerobic digestion tank, the toxic gas trapped in the effluent treatment plant had leaked out. The toxic gas is mainly Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S) according to our field officers as well as the NBRO.
The gas may also have contained methane, ammonia and carbon dioxide too, he explained.
Jayasinghe said lapses in following safety precautions could be observed in this incident. He said the EPL for the factory had been issued by the CEA Kalutara District Office and that it had been renewed five months ago.
With the suspension of EPL, the operations and functions of the company come to a halt.

Fare meters made mandatory for three-wheelers
The government has made it mandatory for three-wheelers to have fare meters with the capability of issuing a printed bill to the passenger once the journey is completed from yesterday.
National Council for Road Safety (NCRF) Chairman Dr Sisira Kodagoda urged the three-wheeler drivers to install a meter which can print a bill at the end of the journey. However, in the meantime, a hand written bill will also be permitted, he added.
Such meters are already available in the market, but, action will be taken to provide these meters at a concessionary rate on an easy payment scheme.
The main purpose of introducing the new regulations is to prevent irregularities and shortcomings, and to ensure a secure journey for commuters and eventually produce disciplined taxi drivers who would guarantee the safety of both, the commuter and the driver. The government has already given a grace period last year as well as from January 1 to April 1 this year for the installation of fare meters. After today, the law will be strictly implemented and stern legal action will be taken against passenger transport three-wheelers without fare meters, Dr. Kodagoda said.
It is the duty of the driver to issue a receipt for the payment.Such receipt should include the distance travelled, vehicle registration number, amount charged and the date of receipt, he said. Passengers can directly call three-wheeler drivers since the telephone number is printed in the receipt.
There are around 1.2 million three-wheelers in Sri Lanka. Of them around 900,000 run on a daily basis in the Western Province. He said the law was not to exploit three-wheeler drivers but to regulate their service.
However, United National Three Wheeler Drivers and Industry Workers Union President K.D.Alwis said that making a fare meters mandatory is unfair at the moment because the authorities have failed to solve many problems faced by the three-wheeler drivers."
This is an attempt to paving the way for a particular company to begin a business,"he said.
Eventhough the government pledged many promises such as an insurance scheme, a pension scheme and a housing loan scheme for three-wheeler drivers at the previous Presidential election, non of these promises have been fulfilled yet, he added.

Gayle says 'nothing to prove' after IPL ton
New Delhi, Friday: Veteran West Indies batsman Chris Gayle, who struggled to find an Indian Premier League team, smashed the first century of this season on Thursday to prove his worth to Kings XI Punjab.
His spectacular unbeaten 104 -- with 11 sixes and one four sprayed around the ground off 63 balls -- helped the unfancied Punjab inflict the first defeat of the 2018 IPL on Sunrisers Hyderabad.
"A lot of people thought I'm too old. After this innings, I have nothing to prove," the 38-year-old Gayle said after the 15-run win late Thursday.
Gayle was only selected in the third round of bidding for players by IPL teams for the 2018 season. Punjab signed him for just the $314,000 reserve price in the January auction. He has made only two appearances so far but played a big innings each time. The opener blasted 63 off 33 balls in his side's win over Chennai Super Kings on the weekend.
"I'm always determined, wherever I go in the world and whichever franchise I represent," the destructive left-hander said.
Kings XI advisor Virender Sehwag was instrumental in the team's late bid for Gayle at the auction and he can now expect talks with the batsman.
"Sehwag said in an interview: 'If Chris wins you two games, we have our money's worth'. I need to have a chat with him about that!" Gayle commented.
It was Gayle's sixth IPL hundred and 21st in the 20-over format. Hyderabad had won their previous three games before the match. Punjab made 193 for three and then restricted Kane Williamson's Sunrisers to 178 for four.
The IPL is now in its 11th season with 60 matches over 51 days. There are eight million dollars in prizes at stake - including four million for the winning team. The final takes place on May 27 in Mumbai. AFP

GSP facility to boost fish exports once again
The fisheries sector expects a significant growth with the re-authorised US Generalised System of Preference (GSP) to Sri Lanka effective from April 22.
Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday said that Sri Lankan fisheries exports will receive a 15 percent tax relief due to the re-authorised GSP facility.
During the period of three years Sri Lanka lost more foreign exchange from the fisheries sector since the country did not receive any (GSP) facility. So if Sri Lanka continued to have this GSP facility from the US again, it would be immensely beneficial to further develop the growing fish export industry, Minister Amaraweera said.
Last year, the country earned Rs 28,685 million by exporting around 18,262 metric tonnes of fisheries products.
US President Donald Trump re-authorised the US GSP facility for 120 beneficiary countries (which was not renewed in December 2017) when he signed the Bill on March 23.
According to the Fisheries Ministry sources, the US purchases more than 27 percent of Sri Lankan fisheries exports.
Minister Amaraweera further said that the re-authorization of the US GSP was possible due to the governments commitment to the protection of human rights and the restoration of democracy.
Under the leadership of the President and the Prime Minister, the government has been able to restore Sri Lankas international image as well as strengthening its cordial relations with other countries, he added.

SLC earns record profit from Nidahas trophy, AGM on May 19 :
Gurusinha appointed to high post
Former World Cup winning batsman Asanka Gurusinha has been appointed as Chief Cricket Operations Officer of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) taking overall charge of the High Performance Center, Brain Center and Womens Cricket respectively with effective from 15 May.
Sri Lanka Cricket revealed at the press conference was held in SLC yesterday.
Speaking at a press conference held at SLC headquarters yesterday to make these announcements SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala said, Gurusinha is an Australian level 3 qualified coach with a good technical knowledge to be the high-performance manager, which is our feeder system. The Cricket Board discussed this position and Gurusinha showed interest in undertaking it.
Speaking further the SLC president said, There are players who are getting injured at national level and take more than three months to recover, so our rehabilitation is faced with a fairly big situation.
Sumathipala further said that managing a team is not a bigger problem but when you come to players rehabilitation after injury it is a huge problem for us. Hathurusingha and Gurusinha worked together and we gave it a thought whether to separate them.
Gurusinha will have more responsibility than Simon Willis. With his experience of working with the national team as the team manager who knows exactly what the teams requirements are, we believe with the World Cup coming up in a year, his role will help us to build our plan for our future goals.
Gurusinha was appointed as cricket manager last year and also worked as a coach until Chandika Hathurusinghas appointment as head coach.
SLC AGM on May 19
Sumathipala also revealed that the AGM of SLC would be held on May 19 and that according to the amended Sports Law he is liable to stand for elections for another two-year term.
Historical profit for SLC
Sri Lanka Cricket earned a net income of nearly Rs. 940 million with total revenue achieved standing at Rs. 1.38 billion from the recently concluded Nidahas Trophy series that involved India and Bangladesh.
This is the first time Sri Lanka Cricket has been involved in such a historical profit through the Nidahas Trophy. A profit of Rs. 900 million has been reaped from total revenue of Rs. 1.38 billion. The SLC had already realized all the revenues generated with 90 percent of the funds being collected even before the tournament started, said Sumathipala.

IMF approves fourth tranche of Extended Fund Facility
The International Monetary Fund has approved the fourth tranche of Sri Lanka Extended Fund Facility.
This is after constructive discussions with officials in Colombo and during the Spring Meetings in Washington DC.
IMF mission chief for Sri LankaManuela Goretti, issuing a statement yesterday said the IMF team reached a staff-level agreement with the Sri Lankan authorities on the fourth review under an economic reform program supported by a three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement 
All the end-December quantitative performance criteria under the program were met, as the authorities have successfully advanced fiscal consolidation and strengthened international reserves.
Due to a weather-related spike in food prices, inflation exceeded the upper limit for the inner band for December, but has since fallen back within the inner band. The authorities are taking actions to implement all the pending structural benchmarks for this review, despite some delays.
Following subdued growth in 2017 due to the lingering effects of weather-related shocks, a recovery is underway as agriculture has started to rebound and food prices decelerated. Real GDP growth is expected to reach 4 percent and inflation to remain below 5 percent in 2018. Exports are also recovering and the recent sovereign bond issuance was successfully oversubscribed. However, the economy remains vulnerable to adverse shocks given the still sizable public debt, large refinancing needs, and low external buffers.
Subject to cabinet approval of an automatic fuel pricing mechanism-consistent with the EFF-supported program, the Board is expected to consider Sri Lankas request for completion of the fourth review in June 2018. The measure would represent a major step towards completing energy pricing reforms in 2018. Further efforts remain needed to strengthen governance and mitigate fiscal risks from state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Progress in implementing the Inland Revenue Act (IRA) and other revenue measures in the 2018 budget remains essential for meeting social goals and improving debt dynamics. The central bank should continue to remain vigilant in guarding against inflationary pressures, while continuing to build reserves and supporting greater exchange rate flexibility.
Under the EFF-supported program, sustaining the reform momentum is critical to strengthen the resilience of the economy to shocks and promoting inclusive and strong growth.
The authorities should push ahead with their Vision 2025 objectives, by further advancing fiscal consolidation through stronger fiscal rules and SOE governance; modernizing monetary and exchange rate frameworks; accelerating their inclusive growth reform agenda, through trade liberalisation, climate, and gender budgeting; as well as better-targeted social protection programs.

Interpol Red Notice on Mahendran
The Interpol has issued a Red Notice against former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran in connection with the Central Bank Bond issue.
This Red Notice had been issued pursuant to a request made by the Criminal Investigation Department after providing information on the case.
A Red Notice is a request to locate and provisionally arrest an individual pending extradition.
It is issued by the Interpol at the request of a member country based on a valid national arrest warrant.
On a previous occasion, the Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued a warrant written in English for the arrest of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, in connection with the Central Bank Bond issue.
Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne had issued a warrant against Arjuna Mahendran, the first suspect in the case, since he failed to comply with court orders.
On a previous occasion, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena, arrested in connection with the Central Bank Bond issue, were ordered to be further remanded till April 26 by the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court.
On February 16, Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne refused to release the two suspects on bail, citing that reasons given by the defence were not sufficient to consider releasing the suspects on bail under exceptional circumstances.
The suspects have been charged under the Public Property Act, Penal Code, Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and Code of Conduct for Primary Dealers for illegal insider trading.
Filing a B report before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court regarding the Central Bank Bond issuance on February 27, 2015, the CID had named former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius, its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena and the PTL as suspects in the case.
The prosecution maintained that there had been a direct loss to the government following the issuance of bonds on February 27, 2015.
The bond commission report has revealed that PTL has illegally earned a profit of at least Rs. 688 million from the concerned bond auction .
The prosecution said that Arjuna Mahendran can be charged with the criminal breach of trust, misappropriation of public funds and two others for aiding and abetting to commit this offence.

Joes triumph 26-22 but Kingswood win hearts of the crowd
St. Josephs College came out on top but the gutsy Kingswood College Kandy rugby team won the hearts of many spectators including the Colombo crowd who witnessed a superb game of rugby dished out by both teams.
St.Josephs eventually ran out winners by 26 points (4 tries, 3 conversions) to 22 (3 tries, 2 conversions, 1 penalty) in their Singer A Division inter-schools league rugby tournament first round game played at Havelock Park yesterday. At half time Joes led 19-12.
Kingswood forwards fought like terriers in the entire match combining effectively with their three quarters giving no room for their opponents winning all the good ball and line outs but St. Josephs finally came out on top and won the game due to the individual brilliance of their star wing three quarter K.D. Kavinda who scored three breathtaking tries.
Joes scored first and went into a 7-nil lead when winger Dulanjana Piyatissa out foxed and went through the Kingswood defence, where he finally drew the final defender and sent Kavinda over to score a try with a superb offload. Fly half Santhush Algama made the conversion.
Immediately Kingswood cut down the lead to 7-5 when their full back Dinal Ekanayake sliced through the Josephian three quarters to score a corner flag try. Scrum half Hirusha Sampath missed the conversion.
In the 18th minute of play St. Josephs increased their lead to 12-5 when Kavinda collecting the ball from a sweeping three quarter move dived over to score a try which Algama fired across the conversion.
Joes increased their lead in the 32nd minute of the game when Algama went through the defences of the Kingswood lads to touch down for a try which he himself converted to make the score 19-5 in favour of the Maradana boys.
Just on the stroke of half time Kingswood outside centre Seneviratne scored the try of the match when he dummied and scampered through for a try after a 40 metre dash far right to close the gap to 19-12. Sampath made the conversion.
After the turn around with pressure mounting on the Joes, Kingswood added more pressure on the Maradana boys who crumbled down when in the 47th minute Kingswood prop forward Chandraratne barged through for a try off a ruck. Sampath made the conversion to equal the score to 19-all.
In the 60th minute Kingswood grabbed the lead for the first time in the game 22-19 when Sampath put over a spectacular 45 metre penalty.
Joes sealed the game when off a superb three quarter move Kavinda darted down to score his third and match winning try. Algama, who had a fine game with his boot slotted in the conversion in the 63rd minute to make the score 26-22.
Kalhara stars as Isipathana edges out Wesley 22-17
Two brilliant tries by Isipathana College scrum half Chamath Kalhara enabled them to record a close 22 points (3 tries, 2 conversions, 1 penalty) to 17 (2 tries, 2 conversions, 1 penalty) win over Wesley College in their Singer A division inter-schools league rugby tournament first round game played at CR & FC grounds in Longden Place yesterday. At lemons Pathana led 22-nil.
For the winning Isipathana side the three tries were scored by Kalhara (two) and winger Ramitha de Silva (one). Captain Manelka Ruberu slotted in the two conversions and the solitary penalty.
Full back Thikshana Vithanage and fly half Mursheed Doray scored the tries for Wesley College with fly half Doray making both the conversions as well as the penalty.

Larger lessons for India from the Facebook data scandal
Social media networks such as Facebook and WhatsApp now make it possible to communicate with large numbers of people, individually or in small targeted groups. This can be a big boon for elected and aspiring politicians in a representative democracy where getting closer to voters is the ultimate aim.
The role of social media in democracies should therefore have been celebrated and not scorned. Yet, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has just been subjected to a grueling examination in Washington by democratically elected representatives for allegedly putting electoral democracy at risk.
How is it possible that a technological innovation that should have been celebrated as a giant leap for representative democracy is accused of putting that very idea at risk
It is a case of an extremely useful technology gone completely awry. Massive social damage has been inflicted by what was supposed to be a cool technology. The ramifications of the impact of social media in democracies are relevant everywhere, not least in India, the world's largest democracy, as it prepares for parliamentary elections next year.
Social media platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp and others have built huge bases of users primarily because people can generate their own content and share it instantly with whoever they want to.
Facebook and WhatsApp
There must be something liberating about expressing oneself to the world that has driven billions of people to these platforms. With these user bases, platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp now own pipelines that can connect to almost every individual on the planet. Social media platforms allow messages to be tailored in contrast to communication via traditional means such as public rallies, newspapers and television. This ability to connect to large numbers of people almost on an individual basis can be very tempting for anyone that need to market their wares or messages.
But, as the Facebook affair highlights, things can go badly wrong. Some 270,000 users answered seemingly innocuous questions in 2014 on their page and, perhaps unknowingly, gave permission to questioners to gain access to all their contacts, a total of up to 87 million people. Facebook says the data was improperly acquired by Cambridge Analytica, a political campaign consulting firm which worked on Donald Trump's U.S. Presidential election campaign and denies it acted wrongly. Millions of people were allegedly fed fake news and propaganda during the election campaign.
Electoral democracies
Any misuse of private data on social media is absolutely abominable. Peddling false, divisive and hate propaganda is equally abominable. Lest we forget, even without the alleged theft of data involved in this case, any campaigner could still have paid Facebook, enormous sums of money to target those same millions of people with similar propaganda. It is called targeted advertising, which is after all, Facebook and other social media platforms legitimized business model.
With their pipelines to nearly every adult on the planet, social media companies make money by renting these connections to anyone wanting to communicate with a specific target individual or small groups of individuals, based on any criteria such as race, religion, age, gender, location, behavioural patterns etc. The ability to target specific groups and individuals can easily be misused and manipulated. For example, specific messages can now be sent to specific racial or religious groups vilifying other races or faiths.
Is this acceptable in a civilized democracy There are two key criticisms of Facebook in the Cambridge Analytical affair. The first is allegedly allowing the data abuses to take place. The second, which is much deeper, is facilitating distribution of malicious user generated content that threatens electoral democracies. User generated content is after all the very foundation of these social media platforms.
This is a real and present danger, not least in India, a diverse and complex nation with numerous identities. The disease of targeted hate-filled communal campaigns through social media is already threatening our proud liberal democracy. India has 1.3 billion people, practising more than half a dozen religions, speaking more than a dozen languages and often identified along 300 different caste lines. Almost all of them are now connected through the mobile phone and half of them are on social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook. India's beautiful diversity is now under grave danger by vicious and spiteful targeted campaigns through social media, often by political and religious radicals, pitting one group against the other.
Much is often made of the risk of foreign intervention in the democratic process of a sovereign state through social media. But social media platforms today make it possible for anyone -- foreign or not -- to disseminate false, hate and malicious propaganda to targeted groups. As is being witnessed in India, very often such propaganda is more a domestic threat than a foreign one.
Social media companies
The threat of social media to electoral democracies is clear. The solution is not. Content regulation is often thought of as the only plausible way out of the current mess that our societies find themselves in. But that would be retrograde. Perhaps naming and shaming the perpetrators publicly by social media companies and civil society organisations would build enough disincentives for people to not misuse these powerful social media platforms. Facebook and other social media companies need to exhibit far greater social responsibility by being judicious with a business model based on targeted commucations, and not hide behind a veil of maximizing shareholder value.
Civil and liberal societies often solve such complex problems through self-regulation and correction, not external regulation. Past history gives the hope that this could be yet another passing phase of Schumpeterian creative destruction, which liberal democracies such as the United States and India go through and emerge stronger and better -- as they did when print, radio, television and the internet threatened to disrupt traditional politics in the last century. But there is nothing automatic about defending democracy. We must pay heed to these challenges -- and respond.

Mahela Jayawardene is more than a mentor to me: Akila Dananjaya
Sri Lankas new spin sensation in Akila Dananjaya, who rose to fame courtesy his jaw-dropping spell of 6/54 against India, provides the Sri Lankan fans a glimmer of hope to bring resurrection in the nations declining prowess in the game of cricket.
The 24-year old made his debut way back in 2012 under the captaincy of Mahela Jayawardene in the T-20 World Cup in many controversial circumstances.
It is after six years that he has been given the due opportunity to showcase his talent on the world stage.
As a result of his spell that made Indian batsmen dance to his tunes, he was picked for the Mumbai Indians for Indian Rupees 50 lakhs to add a mystery spinner in their ranks.
There were no prizes for guessing that his inclusion in the Mumbai Indians setup was more on the advice of their head coach Mahela Jayawardene.
The Sri Lankan legend has played a huge role in the youngsters career given his return to the professional career after 2012, happened under Mahelas captaincy for Wayamba United in Sri Lankan Premier League.
The off-spinner possesses quality when it comes to his effective variations with the ball.
He has the ability to bowl leg-spin, googly, doosra and the off-spin. It was his quality and control over each variation that struck Mahela and Trevor Bayliss, the coach at Wayamba United.
Whats been really good to see is his temperament, for a guy who hasnt played at this level before. The control with which he bowls his various deliveries is impressive, but hes also shown a lot of poise at the big moments, and a tendency to ignore whats going on around him and do what he does, Jayawardene was quoted as saying.
The coach reckons that the challenges lie ahead of the youngster when batsmen will find a way to make out his variations with the ball. Akila, in his 19 ODIs and 15 T20Is for Sri Lanka, hasnt done enough justice to his ability so far but it is too early to write him off.  Topbuzz

Model village opens in Kirigankumbura
Mihindumgama, the model village constructed in the Kirigankumbura area in Udadumbara, Kandy was opened under the patronage of Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa, yesterday.
Mihindumgama comprises 24 housing units. It has been built on a land extent spanning three acres. Each house has a home garden with an extent of 20 perches.
The Minister said this was the 57th model village to be opened under the model village programme. A total of 670 model villages are being constructed in the country at present. Out of the 670 villages, eight villages are being constructed in the Kandy district.
He said his vision is to construct 2,500 model villages in the country by 2025. The village has all facilities such as electricity, drinking water and access roads.
Uduadumbara U.N.P. organizer Chanaka Ilapperuma, addressing the gathering, said the 24 house owners of the village were selected as they had faced a number of natural disasters and some of them do not even have an inch of land.
Parallel to this programme, 195 families were granted the Samurupiyasa loan in collaboration with Minister Lakshman Kiriella. Hundred families were offered eye spectacles and Rs. 38,000 worth mason tool sets were offered to 60 residents of the area. The total investment on the project was Rs. 34 million rupees.

Murray edges clear at PGA Tours Texas Open
Grayson Murray fired a five-under-par 67 to claim a one-shot lead after the first round of the Valero Texas Open in San Antonio on Thursday.
The 24-year-old from North Carolina, chasing only his second career win on the PGA Tour, edged clear of the field thanks to some long putting and solid iron play on the par-72 TPC San Antonio Oaks course.
The American got off to a dream start, opening with back-to-back birdies on his first two holes before a superb chip from the fairway gave him a birdie tap-in on the fifth to move to three under. His round threatened to come apart on the par-three seventh, when he needed three shots to get onto the green before two-putting for a double-bogey five.
However Murray came storming back on the back nine, draining a 28-foot putt on the 11th for a birdie and then sinking another long putt on the 13th to move back to three under. AFP

New realities of unity government
Leading politicians of all hues anointed with the auspicious Avurudu oil are moving to the New Year, taking them to new challenges in national and party politics, and facing the realities of a unity government having members seated both in the Government and Opposition.
The prorogation of Parliament, coming after many years when this tradition was ignored or was not required by the realities of day-to-day politics and governance, did bring about some quiet and helped give a bigger focus to Avurudu festivities. The departure of President Maithripala Sirisena to the UK for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting also brought some calm to what could have been a period of heated political debate in the context of the jolting developments in post-No Confidence politics.
As the crackers, rabana rhythms and pillow fights of Avurudu celebrations move away, we move to the politics of a new reality where the Unity Government has to take urgent measures to face up to division in its ranks, particularly the situation within the SLFP, the lesser partner of government, which party is led by the Head of Government, President Sirisena. It was certainly a time of mockery of the traditions of parliamentary propriety when the 16 members, including Cabinet members, who voted for the NCM against the Prime Minister did not resign from the Cabinet, but wanted the approval of the President and their party leader to do so. In keeping with the declared commitment to parliamentary democracy, the choice was one of even delayed decency, and the group had to resign.
They will now sit in the Opposition benches in Parliament, but have stated they will not be part of the Joint Opposition (JO), and will continue to support the President from their new seats in the House.
It is certainly an interesting development that will see even more action by the JO to embrace them into its ranks, under the leadership of former President and SLFP leader, Mahinda Rajapaksa. It also paves the way for new differences within the SLFP to emerge as the President moves to carry out what is described as a scientific re-shuffle of the Cabinet and bring in new life and purpose to the Unity Government; shaken up so badly after the defeat of the UNP and SLFP in the February 10 local government polls, and the later NCM campaign against the Prime Minister.
Whatever the science of the coming re-shuffle, the President will certainly have to give serious thought to continued unity in government, prevent encroaching by the JO and Mahinda Rajapaksa ranks into what is left of the SLFP. The country also needs a strong message of allegiance to the policies of the January 2015 Presidential Poll campaign, which saw his election as President, defeating Mahinda Rajapaksa who was seeking to be in the executive presidency for many decades more.
Size of Democracy
There are several authoritative voices on the Constitution and the 19th Amendment to it, which President Sirisena did push through Parliament, who dismiss views of legal and constitutional analysts that the National Government is no more after the breakup of the SLFP, and 16 government members sitting in Opposition ranks. The formal position is that as the UPFA, of which too President Sirisena is the head, is still in the national government the unity government remains. The position is that the party with a higher number of seats (in this instance the UNP) can have an agreement with any small party to form a national government.
This will certainly suit the politics of advantage, but is it the substance of Democracy, and public expectation There is little doubt that one of the major criticisms of this government has been the size of its Cabinet. From a Constitutional limit of 30, it went far beyond 40 because of a national government of unity.
There are hopes and expectations that the departure of 16 SLFP members, including Cabinet members, would lead to a smaller Cabinet in the scientific structure of a future Cabinet. But the politics of advantage, which has been the consistency of unity government, thinks larger is better, with science having little say. This is certainly a major issue that President Sirisena will have to look into as he begins whatever process of reconstruction of government, because a Cabinet as large as the former, although helping to satisfy the expectations of politicians, will certainly lead to further opposition and criticism among the public.
This is an area that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe too should pay keen attention to, because winning back the public support the UNP has clearly lost, as seen in the local government polls, is of importance to the UNP and his leadership. Presenting a smaller Cabinet, could require some UNP members moving to the back benches, but that would give the party much more public acceptance, and help in the party reorganisation reportedly underway. If both parties, in a spirit of revived unity, could limit the Cabinet to 30, despite the possibility of more in unity. It would be a major push for greater popularity.
While on the UNP reforms, the appointment of a Politbureau (PB) in the party, seems to give a bigger voice and strength the younger members demanding a role in the wider leadership of the party.
The absence of the most senior members of the party in the PB certainly shows the acceptance of the need for structural and organisational changes, which could give the party a wider reach to the public in elections ahead. What will be most significant in these reforms is the selection of a new General Secretary. The success of Navin Dissanayake in the Nuwara Eliya District in the recent local government polls, presents him as a good choice for future leadership. But, the party certainly has to go through a much larger shake up, with a revivalist approach to policy and presentation, if it is to gather all its forces to meet the challenge of the SLPP  amidst a hugely declining SLFP  in the months ahead.
The 20A
The JVPs move to present a 20th Amendment to the Constitution has all signs of being a major issue of politics in the coming months. In fact it seeks to give new meaning to the pledge given by the campaign for the Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena, in January 2015. The political and opportunist realities that have pushed the plans for constitutional reform very far back, and especially the abolition of the Executive Presidency, makes this of special significance in the UNP  SLFP rivalries, too.
It is noteworthy that SLFP members in the unity government have been against the abolition of the Executive Presidency, although President Sirisena stood for it in his election, and the SLFP has called for it from the time it was introduced in 1978.
The manoeuvring of politics shows the SLPP, and Mahinda Rajapaksa himself, supporting the JVP move, but with the catch of calling for the dissolution of the current parliament, too. On the other side is the announcement by the SLFPs General Secretary, Duminda Dissanayake, addressing a press conference at his ministry that Maithripala Sirisena would be the SLFPs candidate for the presidency at the next presidential election. It is hardly likely this would have been said without the knowledge of President Sirisena.
This raises several political questions of importance. If President Sirisena is to be the SLFPs candidate for the next executive presidency would he contest Gotabhaya Rajapaksa Another question, if the presidential poll precedes the General Election, as expected today, would a future Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa wish to be serving under President Sirisena
More importantly, is the SLPP and Mahinda Rajapaksas call for dissolution of parliament to be added to the abolition of the Executive Presidency, a plan to kill two big birds with one stone
This debate will certainly spread among the public that has been calling for the abolition of the Executive Presidency for nearly 40 years. The sides for and against it have switched recently. The UNP is clearly supportive of the ban so far, but what will be its position if the contest ahead is only for the office of Prime Minister Would the SLPP prefer to see a UNP President and Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister The twists and turns are many and knotty.
The situation is tangled as the government does not have votes for a two-thirds majority in parliament anymore. Such a vote will need the full backing of the UNP and SLPP, with the JVP, TNA and some LFP and other minority members. The issue then is putting it to a referendum if adopted in parliament.
This is certainly a big call for action by the JVP and civil society organisations that were together in January 2015, when the people voted for this change, but was pushed by the forces ranged against the will of the people, especially in government.

No room for error as Barca face Sevilla in Copa del Rey final
Madrid, Friday: Barcelona and Sevilla will know the success of their respective seasons is on the line when they go head to head in the Copa del Rey final on Saturday.
The Cup would certainly have been third on Barca's list of priorities only a month ago, but the shattering Champions League defeat to Roma has altered perceptions of what might have otherwise have been a stellar campaign.
Unbeaten in La Liga and virtually certain to win the title, a domestic double may not be enough to remove the lingering disappointment from Rome, particularly if arch rivals Real Madrid clinch their third consecutive European crown.
"I live with a little anxiety," Barca midfielder Philippe Coutinho said Thursday. "But it is a very important and very happy moment, playing a final only two or three months after arriving."
Another surprise loss this weekend would certainly settle the argument, even if it seems strange to declare a team under pressure six days after they marked the longest unbeaten run in La Liga history.
In moulding his team around organisation, hard work and the irrepressible Lionel Messi, Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde has steered this team away from the club's more free-flowing, attacking traditions. He has proven a master of extraction, drawing the very best from a squad that unexpectedly lost one of its star strikers in Neymar last summer, and owns far less talent than its predecessors.
Sevilla have fewer questions to answer in terms of entertaintment. Since Vincenzo Montella took charge in December, they have beaten Atletico Madrid, twice, Manchester United and drawn with Bayern Munich and Barcelona.
They have also conceded five goals at home to Real Betis and lost to minnows Alaves, Eibar and Leganes. In their draw against Barca, they shipped two goals in the 87th and 89th minutes.
"We know how they play, that they have quality and a fast counter-attack," Coutinho said. "The most important thing is to think about ourselves, how we have to play and what we should do to win."
Sitting seventh in the table and 17 points adrift of the top four, a trophy -- particularly with a win over Barca -- would diminish a disappointing league position and enhance their run to the Champions League quarter-finals. Lose, and there will be little left to cling onto.
"We have a great opportunity to win a title for the club," Sevilla midfielder Pablo Sarabia said. "We have to think about the good things from this season.
"It is true we have not been consistent in the league but in the Champions League we have made history and in the cup we have the opportunity to lift a trophy."
While Barca, the defending champions, are chasing their 30th Copa del Rey triumph in the Wanda Metropolitano stadium's first tournament final, Sevilla are bidding to win their sixth, and first since 2010.
Barca fans are expected to jeer Spain's national anthem before kick-off amid ongoing political unrest between Catalonia and the Spanish government.
"I'm not going to say anything," Valverde said. "I just want the players to respect each other."
Atletico Madrid, who remain 12 points behind Barca in second place after a chastening 3-0 defeat at Real Sociedad on Thursday, will look to make amends at home to fifth-placed Real Betis on Sunday while Celta Vigo and Valencia face off on Saturday.
Valencia sit three points behind Real Madrid, who will be using their well-timed weekend off to prepare for the first leg of Wednesday's Champions League semi-final against Bayern Munich. AFP

No Williams sisters, no problem as USA target Fed Cup final return
Paris, Friday: The United States aim to prove again that they can thrive without Serena and Venus Williams when they tackle France for a place in a second consecutive Fed Cup final this weekend.
In 2017, the US won the tournament for the 18th time with a nerve-racking 3-2 victory over Belarus which was only decided in the last doubles rubber when CoCo Vandeweghe and Shelby Rogers claimed the winning point.
The Williams sisters did not feature in that final in Minsk but they returned to national colours in February this year in a first round victory over the Netherlands which set-up this weekends clash in France.
Im very confident that we can make it to another final, Vandeweghe told fedcup.com ahead of the tie on indoor clay at Aix-en-Provence.
We have a lot of depth in our squad. From the singles players to the doubles, I think we have come together really well.
The American team boast world number nine and US Open champion Sloane Stephens, 13th-ranked Madison Keys, Vandeweghe, who is at 16 in the rankings, and doubles specialist Bethanie Mattek-Sands.
France, two-time Fed Cup champions, will be led by world number 20 Kristina Mladenovic but other team members Pauline Parmentier and Amandine Hesse are a modest 122 and 204 respectively.
Vandeweghe is on a 13-match win streak in the Fed Cup and has not been defeated in three years in the tournament.
The Fed Cup has been extremely important for me both as a player and a person, said the 26-year-old New Yorker. Its my number one priority to play for my country.
The US have won 11 of 13 Fed Cup meetings against France. However, the French have won two of the nations most recent three meetings.
In the other semi-final, Germany host 10-time champions Czech Republic on clay in Stuttgart.
Germany have only beaten the Czechs once in eight meetings and that was back in 1987 in Vancouver. AFP

The Former President said that the Joint Opposition had a bright future, so they are confident of forming the next regime.
He said the government has halted development work that his regime inaugurated.
"We want a general election to save the country and its people. The UNP is undergoing a deep crises. The rulers are blowing trumpets, while the citizens live under dire circumstances. Meanwhile, the government plans to postpone the election," former President said.

Prorogation and after
The President prorogued Parliament on the eve of Sinhala and Hindu New Year. Perhaps it was a New Year gift from the Head of State. Anyway, whatever is said and done, it is a grim reminder to his opponents that the Executive President is still the master of the house. It would certainly have drawn a sigh of relief from three Ministers against whom three No-Confidence Motions were pending.
The JVP, on the other hand would find its best of intentions thwarted by the lapse of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution. COPE and PAC - irritants to many a miscreant in public office also stand dissolved. The National Audit Bill and the Judicature (Amendment) Bill also lapse. More than all these the SLFP will get a further few days of breathing space for the President to manoeuvre before the rebel 16 MPs' cross over to the Opposition in Parliament. The thousand dollar question is which of these consequences did the President had in mind in deciding to prorogue Parliament suddenly.
Such prorogation to avoid embarrassment has become a tradition in the country. For example, in an earlier instance we saw Parliament being prorogued without giving it an opportunity to discuss the report of the COPE chaired by DEW Gunasekera MP.
Cabinet reshuffle
The President and Prime Minister are once again promising a new beginning and a new programme of action. Promised also are a Cabinet reshuffle and a reform of the UNP. Whether they would be superficial, cosmetic or comprehensive is yet to be seen.
One thing is clear. Notwithstanding the patriotic rhetoric that falls from their holy mouths like the waters of the Dunhinda falls, the fate of the masses or of the country is the furthest in their minds. It is that all parties are more interested in and are getting ready for the Presidential election in 2020. The UNP made it known that the Presidential candidate will be the Prime Minister. The SLFP also repeatedly says that its candidate will be President Sirisena, despite the latter remaining non-committed so far. The SLPP is certain to put a candidate though several names are still being considered.
However, the entire discourse about the next presidential election is centred round three personalities of the South. Various analysts are even predicting the possible outcome of the election now itself. One major drawback in their estimates is their assumption that only three candidates from the South would matter.
No allowance is made for the effect that would have on the outcome in case the voters in the North and East of the country back a strong regional candidate or abstain from voting. Besides political alignments in the South itself are still unstable and cross-currents are many and varied that the final equations cannot be surmised with precision. It would be nave to do so.
Next presidential election
The prospects of the outcome changed at the last moment when a common candidate entered the scene. Till then the election was seen as a one-horse. Hence, one cannot rule out dark horses emerging at the last minute, if not earlier. Hence, it is too early to predict the results of the next presidential election. It would be like preparing the horoscope of a baby yet to be born, if one may use a local adage.
It is not only nature that is subject to change. Change is characteristic of social life too. That means the entire ensemble of social relations ranging from economics, politics, law to ideology and religion are not static but dynamic.
Political parties and their support bases also are not static and immutable. Therefore, prescriptions for development that may have been valid in 1947 or 1956 or for that matter even in 1970 and 1977 are not valid today. Today the five-fold alliance of sanga-veda-guru-govi-kamkaru (the Sangha-physician-teachers-peasant-worker) cannot be resurrected. Nor can the old type anti-UNP fronts have any meaning. The SLFP has been almost fully replaced by the SLPP, which has even carved out a large chunk of the UNP support base so that the latter is reduced to a minority with a neo-liberal outlook. More splintering of the UNP could be expected. The comprador bourgeoisie with links to the then colonial properties no longer exists and the indigenous bourgeoisie fighting for its own niche in the world market is behind the SLPP carrying a sizeable section of the petty-bourgeoisie also with it using anti-imperialist rhetoric.
Obviously there is a vacuum which could be filled by a Third Force. However, none is in the horizon, principally due to the weak, splintered Left and the continuation of disunity, suspicion and alienation among different national communities.
Failure of the two-party system
The civil society has a vital role to play in developing a social movement that could inspire the majority of the population who has lost all hope for the future due to the failure of the two-party system. An intellectual revolution is a pre-condition to give confidence to the masses that the status quo could be changed, that a better Sri Lanka is possible. It is in this respect that the silence of those who see and understand the dangerous slide of our country into an abyss is more damaging than the actions of those that cause that slide.
For example, many criticize the economic policies that have failed and even now fail to develop the country. Yet no alternative is proposed or worked out. In this situation people tend to believe that there is no other way. It is up to the progressive intellectuals-academics and professionals to put their heads together and work out an alternate development plan.

## Title: Royal go out favourites against Trinity
## Supertitle: 74th Bradby Shield first leg at Royal Sports Complex :

74th Bradby Shield first leg at Royal Sports Complex :
Royal go out favourites against Trinity
Royal College, Colombo will go out as clear favourites against Trinity College, Kandy when they scrum down in the first leg of the 74th Bradby Shield rugby encounter at the Royal Sports Complex at 4.15pm today. The junior game for the C. E. Simitharachchi trophy will be played prior to the first XV encounter.
The two teams look almost even but Royal has a firm edge due to having remained unbeaten thus far with Trinity managing to win only two games after four matches the two sides have played so far this season. Royal also have the advantage of playing in front of their home crowd in Colombo.
Nevertheless, Trinity will make every effort to beat them in their own den. The team that takes control of the game within the first 30 minutes should hold the key to winning the first leg of the Bradby Shield in this much looked forward to encounter.
The outcome of this first leg would mainly depend on how the Trinity three quarters will make use of the good ball. Trinity has always enjoyed the luxury of speedy and penetrative set of three quarters and it is no exception this time. If the Trinity forwards could secure good ball and feed their three quarter line more often, then Royal will face a tough task.
Nevertheless, Royal has its own strength to give the Lions a testing time as they could boast of a mobile eight who will use their heavy forwards to score through the famous rolling maul as usual. When one talks about the success of Royal forwards, it goes back to that invincible side of Royal 2015 with their unsung hero (highest try scorer in the league that year) and rolling maul specialist number eight Supun Warnakulasuriya who scored four back to back tries in the second leg at Royal Complex. Incidentally he is the present Royal rugby team manager.
Going down memory lane Royal had its best pack in 1988 when burly number eight Lasitha Gunaratne (Bonza), coached by Dr. Fred Perera (one of the best schools rugby coaches produced by Sri Lanka who captained the Reid Avenue school in 1971), produced a champion unbeaten side where Royal won the Bradby, inter-schools league and the inter-schools R.Premadasa Trophy knockout by beating Isipathana (13-0). They also went on to win both their games against Hong Kong school side and a Combined Schools team in Hong Kong during their tour of the island nation. That year they lost only the Schools rugby 7s to Sudesh Abeysinghes Isipathana College.
Experienced wing three quarter and play maker Sabith Feroze will captain Royal which will make every effort to humble the Lions in Colombo to go one step forward to retain the Bradby Shield for the fourth consecutive year. But everything will depend on how Royal granite hard forwards will play today.
Royal has enjoyed a fabulous season this year having won all their matches against Kingswood College Kandy (29-3), St. Anthony's College Kandy (55-13), S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia (55- nil), St.Josephs College Maradana (18-13) in the ongoing 2018 Singer league rugby championship.
In contrast, Trinity had their best team in recent times in 1987 as the Lions remained unbeaten under Tyrell Rajapakse coached by Alex Lazarus, where they only conceded a solitary try to the opponents in the entire league tournament and former Havies, CR and national flanker Pradeep Lakshantha having the honour of scoring that superb try for Isipathana against Trinity that year (which clearly showed the different skills laid out by their head coach Lazarus that famous year). The forte of Rajapakse's undisputed team was that they had a speedy back division led by playmaker cum one of the best fly halves the country has produced todate in Shah Doole (now domiciled is USA) that injected superpower into the 1987 Trinity outfit.
Leading Trinity in the 2018 Bradby first leg will be full back Avishka Lee.
Trinity has a slightly low record this season being placed fourth in the 2018 Singer league. Trinity has two wins to their credit winning against arch rivals St. Anthonys College Kandy (15-11) and S. Thomas College Mount Lavina (34-24), and losing to St.Josephs College Colombo (32-25) and Kingswood College Kandy (23-21).
The Bradby Shield encounter is considered the most prestigious match in schools rugby, even surpassing any of the tournament matches. It has a rich history which is second to none when it comes to the sport of rugby. The series is played in honour of former Royal principal, the late E.L. Bradby, since 1945. However the Royal-Trinity inter-school rugby series had begun way back in 1920, long before the Bradby Shield was introduced and turned out to be a two-leg affair.
Of the 73 encounters to date, Trinity takes the lead with 39 wins to Royals 32 and there were two ties in the series in 1992 (3-3) and (0-0), in 2016 (22-17) and (13-18).
Over the years, it has produced many top Sri Lanka players and traditions that could only be witnessed at the Bradby Shield encounter.
Whatever the outcome of the game may be, one guaranteed factor is that the thousands of rugby fans who will fill the Royal Complex grounds to capacity are assured of a game of fast open rugby.
Ex-Trinity winger and 1981 triple champions Havelock centre Bharatha Mendis who scored that spectacular match winning try in the dying moments of the Bradby first leg game in 1979 at Bogambara grounds (Trinity won 4-3) said: It was a fantastic feeling to get the Lion spirit going in that memorable day in 1979 which I still cherish in my memory. In the upcoming Bradby 1st leg today, Royal has a very good and a balanced side and Trinity will have to pull out something really extraordinary to spring a surprise in order to keep Bradby hopes alive. As a Trinitian my heart and soul wants Trinity to win, however may the better side win today.
Rohantha Peiris, former Royal and CR & FC rugby captain as well as the present Royal College rugby advisory committee chairman said: We are not taking Trinity lightly and we want a potential Bradby special. This Trinity side is a balanced one even though they lost two games this year. I am sure they will do well in this match. Our team will not take it easy and wants to play better to win this game. We will execute our plans in a formal manner. I wish both teams well.
Ex-Trinity College vice-captain, coach, Kandy SC and Sri Lanka captain cum present champion Kandy SC head coach Sean Wijesinghe said, The Bradby is a different game, a weak team can come out well on the day. Royal looks superior but as per my view Trinity is not short of talent. The team that handles pressure well on that day will be on top at any given time. Trinity is going as under dogs today and physically we have seen many times even at international level, the clear favourite losing to them. As a Trinitian I definitely want to see Trinity winning today because for me I have one school, one club and one nation in life.
Present Royal College head coach (former Royal College rugby vice captain, CR and Sri Lanka national captain) Dushanth Lewke said, The Bradby is a whole different ball game and it's a tough match for us hence we are looking forward to the rivalry as well as camaraderie, which is a big part of the Bradby Shield.
Todays game will be refereed by Dinka Peiris, who will be doing his fourth Bradby game on the trot since 2015.
Sujeewa Cooray, the Royal captain of 1981and former CR & FC wing three quarter will be the chief guest at today's first leg.

Security to be beefed-up at tourist hotspots
The government has allocated Rs.30 million to establish Police posts at 20 identified tourist hotspots to provide better security for tourists visiting the country.
This measure was taken in the wake of certain incidents that were reported in Mirissa recently, where a group of Dutch tourists were assaulted, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said yesterday.
Addressing a media briefing at the Hotel School Building  SLITHM to elaborate on the new measures that will be enforced to ensure the security of tourists the Minister said in areas where issues have arisen, measures will be taken by the police to improve the security situation and the tourist police will be further strengthened to handle issues at hand and make Sri Lankas tourist destinations safer for tourists.
The Law and Order Ministry and the Tourism Ministry reqested public cooperation in this regard to notify them when and if such incidents occur. We need to prevent such incidents from taking place in the future, the Minister said.
Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara and Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga, Senior Ministry officials,the IGP and Police officers attached to the Weligama Police, the Weligama Urban Council Chairman and high ranking Coast Conservation Department officials held a meeting prior to the media briefing to discuss measures that needed to be taken with regard to this incident and how best to prevent such incidents taking place in the future.
Minister Madduma Bandara said irrespective of who the perpetrators are, the law will be enforced accordingly. He noted that already 14 arrests have been made in connection with the Mirissa incident and the assault on five Israeli tourists at the Midigama beach.
He said the hotel where the incident had taken place was sealed off until the completion of investigations.
The Minister said a court order had been obtained yesterday to get the CCTV footage of the relevant hotel and the adjoining hotels for investigations.
Meanwhile, when questioned about the action needed to be taken by the Tourism Authority to address the issue of beach boys allegedly harassing tourists, the Director General of the Tourism Development Authority Upali Rathnayake said controlling the beach boys is the responsibility of the police.
However, Weligama Urban Council Chairman Rehan Wijeratne Jayawickrama said this is an isolated incident and it does not suggest that the Mirissa beaches are unsafe for tourists.
These sort of incidents do not occur frequently. Action was taken within 48 hours to address the problem. We intend to organise awareness programmes in collaboration with NGOs and the Tourism Ministry to educate these beach boys on the importance of respecting women and on their behaviour and approach,Jayawickrama said.
He also blamed the Police for failing to notify the Local Government authorities about the incident, of which they came to know only through media reports.
The Matara Police OIC, meanwhile, defending the Police, said that while the incident had occurred in the wee hours of April 8, no complaint had been lodged with the Police until April 10, until a complaint was lodged by a third party to the Tourist Police.
The Police acted swiftly and by the April 13, the suspects were arrested, based on investigations that were initiated, he said.
However, IGP Pujith Jayasundara assured that an investigation is underway to look into the manner in which the Police had acted with regard to these incidents.
Meanwhile, Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Ministry John Amaratunga said he intends to request for the assistance of the Navy to further fortify security on the countrys beaches.
The Minister however, said that the main problem appears to be that there are many unlicensed bars and drugs being distributed in the area.
He said the Excise Department should be held responsible for not having taken measures to raid such illegal establishments and maintain proper standards.
Coast Conservation Department Director General Prabath Chandrakeerthi said they have taken the decision to demolish all illegal structures along coastal areas, while 17 such locations are being identified for demolition which will commence on May 1.
Minister Amaratunga also noted that all Ambassadors and High Commissioners would be called for a meeting shortly in order to notify them about the measures taken by Sri Lanka to make the country safer for tourists, in a bid to rectify the negative publicity the country is receiving due to such incidents.

Shields seeks New Zealand release to play for England
Wellington, Friday: Wellington Hurricanes captain Brad Shields has asked New Zealand Rugby for permission to play for England in South Africa later this year, Chief Executive Steve Tew said on Friday.
The highly-rated flanker is heading to Premiership side Wasps at the end of the Super Rugby season after giving up on All Black selection.
Kiwi-born but eligible for England through his parents, the 27-year-old was expected to feature in coach Eddie Jones' plans for the 2019 World Cup.
But it appears Shields' chance may come sooner than initially expected, with reports in Britain saying Jones wants him in the England squad to tour South Africa in June.
The England coach is attempting to get his side back to winning ways after an underwhelming defence of their Six Nations crown which saw them lose three successive matches.
Shields has led the Hurricanes to the top of the Super Rugby standings and his physical presence would be an asset for England against the Springboks.
However, his contract with the Hurricanes runs until the end of the Super Rugby season in August, meaning he needs permission from New Zealand Rugby.
"We're looking at it and considering the ramifications of releasing him to play for England in the middle of a competition that he's committed to," Tew told reporters.
NZR would not normally be expected to do England any favours, particularly since the All Blacks will meet Jones' team in November.
But Shields is a widely-respected figure in New Zealand -- regarded by many as unlucky to miss All Black selection -- and Tew said this would be considered in NZR's deliberations.
"There's no point not acknowledging that Brad's been a very good servant of the game for a long period of time," he said.
"He's asked for some dispensation and we'll give that serious consideration."
If NZR refuse to release Shields, England could take the matter to arbitration before World Rugby.

The Bradby Shield :
SLR president Asanga Seneviratne goes down memory lane
My first experience of the Bradby Shield was when I ventured over to Longdon Place, the home of rugby one hot Saturday afternoon in June 1982. The ground was packed to capacity. It was an extremely close match. Both defences were outstanding. The scores stood at 9-6 in favour of Trinity.
In the last minute of extra time, Sriyan Cooray the Royal scrum half made a break and was clear and seemed certain to score with no defence in sight.
As he dived for the line the Trinity full back Dushanth Wijesinghe came from nowhere and made an unbelievable tackle that saved the try and the match for Trinity.
Both players were carried off to hospital and the 2nd leg at Nitawella was even closer, with Trinity managing to sneak thru 6-4 in pouring rain.
The Bradby Shield is the blue riband of Sri Lanka rugby and easily the most look forward to rugby encounter in the country.
The 73-year-old tradition will see over 20,000 spectators converge onto the Royal and Pallekele stadiums.
The players who will turnout in this monumental encounter follow a rich tradition of camaraderie, loyalty and sportsmanship and are the envy of every single school boy and fan.
There is no doubt that Royal and Trinity have produced the finest rugby union players this country has seen.
I love the passion in which Trinity play their rugby and they always make the game look so easy. Some of the finest ball players have been produced by them and rugby is second nature to them. Royal has always been excellent at whatever sport they competed in and will never give away an encounter. They are always the side to beat and have handled the pressure over the years with true Royal grit!
The 80s was filled with Royalists and Trinitians dominating rugby in Sri Lanka as they had done since the 50s.
Whilst it is unfair to single out a few I have to mention some of the gentlemen who have played an influential role in any life and helped so many, and contributed immensely to the development of rugby in our country.
My first coaches at CR & FC were all Royalists, Lionel Almeida who was probably one of the finest three quarters, the fastest man in Asia and perennial coach Summa Navaratne doing the fitness and Malik Samarawickrama planning and taking sessions and getting the side together. Ajit Abeyratne (Trinity) was my first national coach and pastor. CPP Abeygunawardena (Royal) my first captain at CR and Rohantha Peiris (Royal), DiIlip Ardihetty (Trinity) are legends I played under. My teammates included Hiran Muttiah, Sriyan Cooray, Kapila Ariyaratne, Janaka Lenaduwa, Ajit Weeratunge, Ajit Gunasekera, Wimal Epparachichi, Mahendra Navaratnam, Sarinda Unamboowe (all from Royal), Pradeep Adihetty, Inthi Marikar, Shah Doole and Thushara Weerasooriya (Trinity). We also had Saman Jayasinghe, Iqbal Hassen, Haron Musafer, Sujantha Sukumar, Junaideen, Srideran, Rabba Gunasekera turning out for CH & FC and Sri Lanka and I used to play touch rugby almost daily with them before cricket practices at CCC!
This rich blend of Royalists and Trinitians had some things in common which I believe are the hallmarks of both sets of old boys.
First and foremost they had character, a trait we struggle to come by in this day and age. The hallmarks of these gentlemen were loyalty, honesty, hard work, a great sense of humour and they never gave up. I am honoured to have known and associated with so many.
The Bradby is marked by festivity and traditional gatherings.
I probably am the only non old boy to have attended the Royal Bradby dinner on no less than 4 occasions! This, in my capacity as president of Sri Lanka Rugby and it has always been a night to remember! Stanley Unamboowe, who was my uncle's classmate, in one of his speeches, openly questioned my credentials to be a Thomian when my fathers entire family attended Royal!
Sri Lanka rugby was built round the Bradby Shield.
The contribution from both institutions is legendary and never be forgotten!
I wish both teams the very best and Gods Blessings.
Esto Perpetua Royal and Trinity!

Southern CAA earns high income through fines
The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) in the Southern region has recorded an income of over Rs.1.1 million from errant traders through court fines.
The Authority has conducted a series of raids and inspections in the Southern region during the last three months. Selling and displaying unsuitable food items for human consumption, changing prices on labels and selling them at high prices, selling electrical appliances without warranty cards, selling bags of cement at high prices, non-displaying price lists, hoarding essential food items and violating orders, rules and regulations imposed by the Consumer Affairs Authority were some of the faults detected by Authority officials during raids.
The officials said the raids and mobile inspections were carried out covering all Divisional Secretariat Divisions in the Galle, Matara and Hambantota districts.
The Authority receives complaints about frauds, malpractices and corruptions against many errant traders daily. Therefore, the CAA has intensified raids during the festive season.
Industries and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen has ordered the officials to carry out the raids, CAA Southern Regional Assistant Director S. Nandasiri said.

Kevin Durant scored 26 points as the Golden State Warriors beat San Antonio 110-97 to take a 3-0 lead over the Spurs who were playing with heavy hearts after the death of Gregg Popovich's wife. Head coach Popovich did not attend Thursday's game which took place just a day after the passing of his wife Erin Popovich who died from a long-term illness.
The couple had been married for four decades and had two children and two grandchildren.
San Antonio assistant coach Ettore Messina coached the team in Popovich's absence.
"Everybody did a really great job as players, as people working in the organization and as staff in trying to support each other and face this moment the way it should be faced as friends," Messina said.

Sri Lanka among globally important agricultural heritage systems
A Sri Lankan agrarian system, the Ellanga Gammana or Cascaded Tank-Village System in the Dry Zone, was designated as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS) by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
The Cascaded Tank-Village System in Sri Lanka was recognized at the International Forum and Awards ceremony for new GIAHS sites in Rome, Italy on Thursday.
FAOs Deputy Director-General Maria Helena Semedo, granted the GIAHS award to Sri Lanka on April 19 at the FAO headquarters in Rome. The Secretary to the Agriculture Ministry B. Wijayaratne received this prestigious distinction on behalf of the country, and especially in the name of the farmers from the Dry Zone who, over millennia have created, developed and maintained the cascaded ponds and tanks in the country.
Thirteen new agricultural heritage sites from China, Egypt, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Portugal, Spain and Sri Lanka were designated this year. With the new sites, there is a total of 50 globally recognized agricultural heritage systems in 20 countries.
This FAO-led initiative aims to protect and promote valuable agricultural heritage, preserve biodiversity and traditional knowledge, as well as create resilient ecosystems.
The proposal to include the Cascaded Tank-Village System in Palugaswewa in the Anuradhapura district to the FAO list of GIAHS was submitted by the Ministry of Agriculture last year. The Palugaswewa Divisional Secretariat area consists of 12 Cascade Systems, and is located within the Malwathuoya and Yanoya river basins. The Cascaded Tank-Village System is a connected series of tanks organized within a micro-catchment of the dry zone landscape, storing, conveying and utilizing water from an ephemeral rivulet. It is an ancient, widely used and unique traditional agriculture system. The system provides water for irrigation, domestic purposes, animals and ecosystems.
The foundation for the largest part of the countrys agricultural production, the village tanks, host a remarkable heritage of agro-biodiversity and wild biodiversity and constitute a unique buffer against natural disasters and climate change.
The global significance of this system is high due to the practical solution it provides to absorb shocks of natural disasters such as floods which can be controlled by storing water and drought by reducing the water loss from tanks due to the existence of the surrounding ecosystem. The Cascaded Tank-Village System also contributes to efficient water management with water from one tank flowing to another, through a network of tanks and streams.
However, the continuation of the Cascaded Tank-Village System is threatened by the poor income of farmers, rural-urban migration of the youth, deforestation, and the degradation of the tank eco-system. Its protection is integral to ensure the continuity and improvement of the countrys food and livelihood security, as well as sustainable rural development.
The Government of Sri Lanka has taken a policy decision to reinforce the Cascaded Tank-Village System and is preparing a Master Plan for the conservation and development of the system. The restoration of the ecological features of the Ellanga Gammana has also been an important component in rehabilitating approximately 200 irrigation tanks in Sri Lanka through various FAO projects implemented in the post-conflict period.
In 2016, with the participation of the village communities, the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture, over 3,000 forest plants were replanted in the upstream section (Gasgommana) and the downstream reservation (Kattakaduwa) of the Palugaswewa cascade system.
Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems such as the Cascaded Tank-Village System in the Dry Zone, have long played, and continue to play a crucial role at a global, regional and national level for food security and sustainable development in the context of climate change.

Tourists safety
Just as inbound tourism was recovering from the ripple effects of violence in Digana, a few other incidents where tourists have been specifically targeted threaten to mar Sri Lankas reputation as a safe destination. Tourism suffered for 30 long years as a result of the conflict in the North and the East. But even during this period no tourists were targeted for attacks, though some were injured in bomb explosions.
Since the conflict ended in 2009, Sri Lanka has become one of the worlds tourism hotspots. Lonely Planet named Sri Lanka as its top destination in 2013 and several other publications have followed suit. Visitor numbers are surging  Sri Lanka is on track to receive 2.5 million tourists by end 2018, with 230,000 arrivals from January to March 2018 alone. The tourism sector is also expected to become the countrys top foreign exchange earner (it is currently third) soon, having earned nearly US$ 4 billion last year.
The number one factor that any tourist looks for in a given destination is safety. We gained this factor after the war, as Sri Lanka became the most peaceful country in the region while the rest of South Asia was mired in conflict. Not surprisingly, tourists began flocking to Sri Lanka in droves, being one of the few destinations in the world to offer nature, culture and adventure as one advertising slogan put it.
But a couple of recent incidents in Weligama/Mirissa can potentially sully this reputation if corrective action is not taken expeditiously. Two Dutch tourists were sexually and physically assaulted in one incident while several Israeli tourists were attacked in the other. Both incidents have resulted in a lot of bad press internationally and if there is any perceived inaction on the part of local authorities, the inbound tourism industry faces the risk of reduced arrivals. Allegations have already been made that local police had gone slow on these incidents because the suspects were apparently connected to provincial politicians, until the Police Headquarters in Colombo prompted action.
If true, this is indeed reminiscent of the cover up in the aftermath of the murder of British tourist Khuram Shaikh and the rape of his Russian girlfriend in Tangalle around seven years ago by a group led by a powerful local politician who was said to be very close to the then regime. International pressure finally forced the then Government to probe the incident, though the tourism industry took years to recover from the negative publicity.
It is thus vital to leave no stone unturned to bring the culprits to justice. Tourism Minister John Amaratunga has rightly assured the international community that the Government would do everything possible to ensure justice for the victims, vowing that no such incidents would happen again. Indeed, the very future of this vital industry depends on keeping his word since we are responsible for the safety and security of visitors to our resplendent isle. Any less, and we risk losing the goose that lays the golden egg. The authorities must also probe whether there was any delay or inaction on the part of the local police to nab the offenders. If this is the case, these police personnel must face appropriate disciplinary action.
More resources and personnel should be commuted to the Tourist Police, especially in tourism hotspots such as Colombo, Kandy, Anuradhapura, Sigiriya/Dambulla, Polonnaruwa, Galle, Unawatuna, Arugam Bay and Tangalle. It is also advisable to teach a few languages other than English to at least the senior officers attached to the Tourist Police. There should be bigger, more visible presence of Tourist Police personnel to deter any criminal elements wishing to harass or harm tourists. They should also take action to remove touts and beggars who harass tourists in many areas. Any unauthorized tourist guest houses, restaurants and bars (a bar connected to one of the above incidents had no liquor licence) must be closed down to ensure the safety of visitors. The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority must work closely with Provincial and Local Councils to ensure that only genuine establishments can serve tourists. In the meantime, the authorities should spur further training for all those involved in the hospitality sector to ensure an additional layer of protection to visitors.
Tourism in Sri Lanka has a great future, with more hotels (J W Marriott, Ritz Carlton, Hilton, ITC, Sheraton, Radisson, Next etc.) and airlines (Edelweiss, IndiGo, Thomas Cook etc.) coming in, apart from additional flights by airlines that already serve Colombo. This is good news, since Sri Lanka needs more hotel rooms and airline seats to cater to the projected number of arrivals. The potential is much greater- even a medium term target of 5 million sounds small compared to the (2016) arrival figures of some neighbouring countries such as Singapore (13 million), Indonesia (12 million), Thailand (32 million), India (15 million), Malaysia (26 million) and Korea (17 million). The inbound tourism industry must strive to gain a bigger share of the Asia Pacific tourism pie and propel Sri Lanka to the top league of Asian destinations.

Two Koreas open hotline between leaders
SOUTH KOREA: The two Koreas opened a hotline between their leaders on Friday, Seoul's presidential office said, a week before a summit between North Korea's Kim Jong Un and the South's President Moon Jae-in in the Demilitarized Zone.
The line links the presidential Blue House in Seoul with the Pyongyang office of the nuclear-armed North's State Affairs Commission, which Kim chairs - one of his most important titles.
The historic connection of the hotline between the leaders of the two Koreas has just been established, said senior Blue House official Youn Kun-young, adding that a test conversation between officials lasted 4 minutes and 19 seconds.
It is the latest step in a whirlwind of diplomacy on and around the Korean peninsula, triggered by the Winter Olympics in the South.
Moon and Kim are due to meet on Friday on the southern side of the DMZ, in what will be only the third inter-Korean summit since the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty, leaving them technically still in a state of conflict.
Seoul is pushing for a declaration that the war is over as a prelude to the signed of a treaty, with Moon declaring Thursday it was a goal that must be pursued.
US President Donald Trump, who is expected to hold his own much-anticipated summit with Kim later, previously offered his blessing for the two Koreas to discuss a treaty. - AFP

Wenger to end 22-year Arsenal stay at end of season
London, Friday: Arsene Wenger will finally bring his 22-year stay as Arsenal manager to a close at the end of the season, the Frenchman announced on Friday.
"After careful consideration and following discussions with the club, I feel it is the right time for me to step down at the end of the season," Wenger said in a statement posted on the club's website.
"I am grateful for having had the privilege to serve the club for so many memorable years."
Wenger, 68, won three Premier League titles, leading the only side to go a full league season unbeaten in 2003-04, and lifted seven FA Cups during his tenure.
However, he has been under increasing pressure to step down from the club's fans for several seasons as Arsenal haven't won the Premier League for 14 years and risk missing out on Champions League qualification for the second consecutive season.
Arsenal's only realistic chance of making the Champions League next season is by winning the Europa League where the Gunners face Spanish giants Atletico Madrid in the semi-finals on April 27 and May 4.
"I urge our fans to stand behind the team to finish on a high," added Wenger.
"To all the Arsenal lovers take care of the values of the club. My love and support for ever."
Arsenal's majority shareholder Stan Kroenke paid tribute to a man of "unparallelled class".
"Everyone who loves Arsenal and everyone who loves football owes him a debt of gratitude," said Kroenke, who took a controlling stake in the club in 2011.
"One of the main reasons we got involved with Arsenal was because of what Arsene has brought to the club on and off the pitch. His longevity and consistency over such a sustained period at the highest level of the game will never be matched."
Arsenal added that a successor to Wenger will be found "as soon as possible".
Growing frustration
Wenger took charge with Arsenal in the doldrums in October 1996, but quickly set about a revolution in English football by overhauling players' diets and bringing an end to the drinking culture that had dogged Arsenal in previous years.
Results soon arrived on the pitch as Wenger's men beat an all-conquering Manchester United side to the title in 1997/98 and won the league again four years later.
His greatest achievement came in 2003/04 with "The Invincibles" side that not only gained plaudits for winning, but the free-flowing, attacking style with which they played.
Despite qualifying for the Champions League for 20 years in a row, though, Wenger was never able to end Arsenal's quest to win the competition for a first time. They closest they came was in 2006 when a young side was edged out 2-1 in the final by Barcelona.
That season was also Arsenal's final campaign at Highbury, but the promise that moving to the 60,000 capacity Emirates Stadium would allow the club to compete financially with the biggest spenders in England and the continent failed to materialise. Instead, Wenger was much-criticised for his unwillingness to spend the money needed to keep up as booming TV revenues saw Premier League rivals splash the cash in an arms race to win titles. AFP

What well miss about Channel Nine
With the stroke of a pen, 40 years of innovation and inspiration were consigned to the dustbin of history: Channel Nine no longer has the contract to cover cricket in Australia.
On Friday the 13th, unlucky in some eyes but not those of my wife Barbara-Ann, who celebrated her birthday, what Kerry Packer had joined together, the men from Cricket Australia put asunder. It was the end of an era that began with revolution and ended with resignation; 40 years recalled with sadness but brightened by the characters who made the cricket coverage essential viewing.
You cant think of Channel Nines cricket coverage without immediately reflecting on the expertise of Richie Benaud. He was the glue that held all the innovation and technology together; meticulous with his diction and as cool as a pina colada when things were going awry. His performance as he introduced a days play at the Gabba once, encapsulates his value and expertise as a presenter. As he was articulating his thoughts, the backdrop suddenly collapsed. Without missing a beat he pushed back with his elbows to ease the Wide World of Sports logo off his head. Just then, his watch alarm started ringing. Continuing without a word out of place, he calmly searched under his cuff for the culprit and duly pressed the button to stop the racket.
There was a cavalcade of stars who inhabited the commentary box: Bill Lawry and Tony Greig going at it hammer and tongs on air and then dining out together at night. Michael Slater and Mark Taylor, who when they werent discussing the merits of country town Wagga, were arguing over who was responsible for the bulk of the run-outs that occurred during their productive opening partnership. Ian Healy would chime in with what sounded like either sports-medicine expertise or classic bs, which inspired one mate to text: Even a broken clock is right twice a day Heals.
In the evolutionary stages the coverage was piloted by the genius of executive producer David Hill and eagle-eyed director Brian Morelli. When Hilly wasnt being innovative, he would threaten: You do another commentary stint like that and Ill hit you over the head with a lead pipe. You knew when Morelli was bored; the instruction to one of the long-tenured and dedicated cameramen would ring out as follows: Okay, focus on his racquet, or that stick hes got in his hand.
The statistics that made the commentators sound like an audio version of Wisden were supplied by two eccentric sticklers for accuracy, Irving Rosenwater and Max Kruger., Rosenwater, from England, was endowed with a calligraphic hand and a parents protective instincts for his treasured cards. When I defiled one of them, which contained details of a players lifelong endeavours on and off the field, I was never again allowed to handle his cards. I could look but never touch.
There was a myriad of overseas guest commentators, headlined by the West Indies Tony Cozier and Englands Freddie Effin Trueman. Cozier would entertain with his Bajan lilt and Caribbean wisdom; Trueman would produce endless one-liners, while clearing the commentary box by puffing on his beloved cigar.
All this mayhem and magic were pulled together by the backroom boys: the directors assistant, the floor manager, the make-up artist, the runners, and the people epitomised by the man of many talents, Renato Ron Castorina. For around two decades Renato kept us on time and on our toes.
On this day that ended an era, I felt most sad for the more recent hierarchy - executive producer Tom Malone, producer Brent Williams, and the talkative and talented director, Bryan Newton. Along with polished presenter Mark Nicholas, they were in the process of creating their own legacy when the tenure was cut short.
In the end the excellence of Channel Nines cricket coverage is best summed up by its beginnings.
Benaud was the epitome of the show-business dictum The show must go on. It all ended on April 13th, 2018, a day to reflect on what has been a thoroughly enjoyable era and a job well done.

Wind breaker to block ash released from Norochcholai
Power and Renewable Energy, and Disaster Management Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya yesterday assured the people in Puttalam that a new wind breaker would solve the issue of ash released from the Norochcholai Power Plant.
The minister was attending a meeting at the Puttalam District Secretariat to discuss the issues of the people as a result of the prevailing drought in the Puttalam District. We have taken all necessary steps to construct a wind breaker at the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant to minimise ash released into the atmosphere and it would soon be in operation. Through this, a sustainable solution to the problem will be provided, he said.
Drought-affected families in the Puttalam District numbering 167,000 have been provided with relief worth Rs. 485 million thus far, said the minister. He explained that they were preparing a Cabinet paper to look into the families who have been left out.

'You make a mistake, you die': Daring but deadly world of freestyle motocross
Tours, Friday: "It's crazy what we do, there's no limit. If you make a mistake, you can die."
They are the chilling words of Japan's Taka Higashino, one of the stars of freestyle motocross, the daring but not always death-defying sport which is gripping a worldwide audience.
After performing a series of high-risk jumps off ramps set up inside an arena in the French city of Tours, the 33-year-old Higashino, a veteran of the X Games culture, warned the sport is not for the faint-hearted.
In 2009, Jeremy Lutz, a 24-year-old Californian and an X Games gold medallist the previous year, was killed after a fall in competition.
Five years ago, Eigo Sato of Japan died after a training accident.
Sato's death almost pushed Higashino to the brink of quitting.
"But as soon as I got back on the bike, I felt great. I know only that this sport makes me smile," he said.
The more dazzling the tricks on their bikes, the better. And the packed house in Tours got their money's worth as riders flew more than 10 metres off the ground.
Once airborne, they take their hands and feet off their machines while allowing their bikes to somersault around them, twisting and turning at 180 degrees.
The dramatic shapes they make are reflected by their names -- 'Tsunami', 'Kiss of Death', 'Cliffhanger', 'Shaolin', 'Superman'.
French star Tom Pages, one of the leading exponents of the sport, admits it's a tough addiction to shake.
"Every time I go to the X Games or Madrid (where the high-profile RedBull X Fighters event takes place) I ask myself: 'What am I doing there I tell myself that this will be the last time," he told AFP.
"It's too hard a life, the knot in your stomach, the urge to vomit."
The sport of freestyle motocross -- or FMX -- enjoys a global circuit, boasting bright lights and dancing girls, and is run under the supervision of the international motorcycling federation.
There are two major centrepieces -- the RedBull X Fighters in Madrid in front of 25,000 fans and the long-established X Games.
Other events run in parallel -- in Mexico, the freestyle stars pull in crowds of 45,000.
Not bad for a discipline which has only been in existence for two decades.
It all started in 1997 when riders headed out to the deserts of America, leaping over sand dunes.
"They were real freestylers, tattooed, real trashers, people who had a high level in motorcycle racing but who preferred to party and do anything in the dunes, people who lived their lives," said Charles Pages, the brother of Tom.
Charles Pages is a former rider himself but after a serious injury, now acts as a judge.
He fell heavily competing at the Bercy arena in Paris in 2010, suffered a head injury and was in a coma for a number of days.
But he was still hooked and three years later he was back in the saddle before another accident in 2015 left him with a shattered ankle.
"I was depressed like never before, I couldn't see the point in getting up in the morning, to eat, breathe, to live," the 37-year-old recalled after realising his days of competing were over.
"Everything I did in my life was in relation to this sport. Today, things are better, but the adrenaline I had when I was riding, I know I'll never find it again.
"There has to be risk because that's where the adrenaline is." AFP
