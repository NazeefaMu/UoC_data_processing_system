Ideal Finances First-Time B+(lka) Rating; Outlook Stable - Fitch
Fitch Ratings Lanka has published Ideal Finance Limiteds National Long-Term Rating at B+(lka) with a Stable Outlook.
Ideal Finances rating reflects its small and developing franchise and limited operating history. The rating also captures the companys high-risk appetite with significant exposure to the more-vulnerable consumer segment and non-core real-estate investments.
Fitch sees the companys exposure to real-estate investments - which constituted 14% of equity at the end of the financial year ended March 2018 (FYE18) - as risky due to their cyclical nature. Fitch expects Ideal Finances large unseasoned loan book to continue exerting pressure on asset quality, following rapid loan growth over the previous few years. The gross regulatory non-performing loan ratio of 1.5% at FYE18 was better than that of higher rated peers.
Fitch expects the companys leverage ratio of 1.9%, as measured by debt/tangible equity, to be pushed up in the medium term by sustained strong loan growth, which is insufficiently supplemented by internal capital generation, although it was better than that of higher rated peers. We expect capital support from Ideal Finances main shareholders, Aravinda De Silva and Nalin Welgama - to help the company meet the enhanced regulatory minimum capital requirement of Rs1.5 billion by end 2019.
Ideal Finance relies on bank borrowings and equity to fund its operation. It has a small and concentrated deposit base, which accounted for 19% of total funding in FY18, owing to its short operating history, having commenced operations in 2012. The company accounted for less than 1% of total non-bank financial institution sector assets in FY18, with vehicle financing making up around 80% of its total gross loans.

INCOME TAX SLASHED FOR ARTISTES, WRITERS
The Government has decided to significantly reduce the income tax on artistes and writers, whose monthly income is over Rs. 50,000, with the aim of providing an incentive to them.
A 10 percent income tax on artistes and writers had been imposed by the former Government if their monthly income exceeded Rs. 50,000. Finance and Mass Media Ministry Spokesman Ali Hassen said the Government has now decided to reduce it to 5 percent and charge it as Withholding Tax.
This proposal, together with several others, will be presented to Parliament by Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera within this month as an Amendment Bill to the newly introduced Inland Revenue Act.
According to the proposed amendments, the royalty payments of artistes and writers upto Rs. 50,000 per month as well as all savings accounts of children will be exempted from income tax.
Hassen said the proposed amendments to the Act have already received Cabinet approval and that they have been forwarded to the Legal Draftsman and the Attorney Generals Departments.
The Gazette containing the proposals is expected to come out later this week or early next week.
The new IR Act which came into force from April 1 was aimed at closing existing loopholes in revenue collection. It introduced a new income tax structure to up state revenue by focusing more on direct taxes while reducing the dependency on indirect taxes.
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera told Parliament last week that the number of income tax files which was 48,850 as at January has now been increased to 336,671.

Indo-Lanka Chamber of Commerce holds AGM
The 10th Annual General Meeting of the Indo-Lanka Chamber of Commerce and Industry was held yesterday at the Taj Samudra, Colombo.
Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu was the chief guest. Export Development Board Chairperson Indira Malwatte and many industry leaders attended the event.
The Indian High Commissioner commended the entrepreneurs for their spirit and hard work in bringing prosperity to both countries. He mentioned the milestones in the relationship between India and Sri Lanka in the past year.
Sandhu spoke about the strengthened bilateral development partnership, noting that India has delivered on the promises made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his last visit to Sri Lanka, in a timely manner: the launch of direct the flights between Colombo and Varanasi; the islandwide launch of the Emergency Ambulance Service; and the handing over of the first lot of the 14,000 houses for upcountry plantation workers. He said Indias development efforts in Sri Lanka were aimed at touching the lives of people.
Sandhu said the two governments alone cannot create the magic of development and that the industrial sectors of the two countries have an important role to play in crafting the developmental trajectory.
The High Commissioner quoted Prime Minister Modis words, from his speech at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit held in Hyderabad last November, wherein he mentioned the traits of entrepreneurs: the power to think differently and ahead of the time for the betterment of mankind is what sets entrepreneurs apart. He urged industry leaders to look far and ahead..
The President of the Indo-Lanka Chamber Vish Govindswamy spoke about the active engagement between the industries of the two countries, marked by an increase in interaction between their Chambers of Commerce and visits of business delegations.
He enumerated the efforts made by the Indo-Lanka Chamber in helping the business between the two countries grow.

IQ cutie!
A three-year-old has been dubbed Britains brainiest child with an IQ of 171 making her smarter than Einstein.
Ophelia Morgan-Dew, of Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire spoke her first word at eight months and quickly learned numbers, colours and the alphabet.
Her mum realised she was bright and took her to experts who have given her an IQ score - of 171. That is a score of 11 above genius Albert Einstein - who had an IQ 160.
Ophelias score is higher than Arnav Sharma, 11, (162), and Rahul Doshi, 12, (162) previously hailed as Britains cleverest kids.
She can even remember things that happened before she was ONE - most adults have no memories before the age of three.
Ophelia is now Britains youngest member of MENSA and is said to have the intellectual capacity of a child more than twice her age.
She is now in the top 0.03 per cent of the population in terms of brain power.
Proud mum Natalie said unusually her first word hiya had TWO syllables.
Natalie said, She loves reading books with me or her dad, and she loves number work and letters and the computer. She is quite an active child, always likes to be doing something and is very spirited. She loves playing with her cousins and going to the park. Ophelia is such a beautiful girl and I would be proud of her no matter what she achieved, as long as she was healthy and happy. A lot of people, including myself, almost shy away from celebrating their childrens intellectual achievement. There seems to be a stigma around it. But then I thought it is no different to parents celebrating a medal in a sports event, so she deserves praise for being so clever.
She added, She has an amazing memory and remembers events that happened before she was 12 months old.
Ophelia attends Abacus 2000 Nursery School in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, three days a week.
She was exceeding all her early learning goals, so her family took her see a child psychologist in London.

Janashakthi Life Delivers 6% YoY growth through 1H
Leading Sri Lankan Life Insurer Janashakthi Insurance PLC (Janashakthi) reported a 6% year on year (YoY) growth in Gross Written Premium (GWP)for the six months ended 30thJune 2018, ending the period under review with premiums of Rs.1.445billion.
Continuing to honour its commitment to policyholders, Janashakthi saw claims grow by 12% YoY, from Rs.546 million to Rs.610 million.Overhead expenses grew from Rs.299 million to Rs.738 million, primarily due to one-off payments related to the divesture of Janashakthi General Insurance Limited and re-structuring.
Investment income grew from Rs.649 million to Rs.750 million, a significant YoY growth of 16%. This was aided largely by the 28% YoY growth in the investment portfolio, from Rs.12.4 billion to Rs.15.8 billion.The total assets of the Company stood at Rs.18.9 billion. This was a result of Janashakthis move to return substantial revenue reserves toits shareholders through a share buyback in March 2018.
We hope that our strong fundamentals together with our ongoing expansion drive and digital-led transformation will keep driving the Janashakthi Life business forward, said Prakash Schaffter, Managing Director of Janashakthi Insurance PLC.
Janashakthi re-branded its Life Insurance business as Janashakthi Life during the month of June, with the launch of a new brand identity supported by an integrated brand communications campaign.
We have managed to deliver steady growth despite undergoing significant transformation during the first half of the year. We embarked on a set of strategic initiatives towards the end of the period to further strengthen our Life Insurance business, said Jude Fernando, Director / Chief Executive Officer of Janashakthi Insurance PLC.

JO deliberating on being independent in Parliament
Party leaders of the Joint Opposition (JO) will meet today under the auspices of former President and Kurunegala district MP Mahinda Rajapaksa to decide if JO MPs should become independent in Parliament, Vasudeva Nanayakkara MP said.
Nanayakkara told the media in Colombo that the JO was contemplating on becoming independent in Parliament due to the prevailing view that they should become independent to obtain the Opposition Leader post.
Recently, a letter, signed by eight UPFA Members of Parliament requesting that the post of Leader of the Opposition be given to UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardena, was submitted to the Speaker.
The letter claimed that 70 members in Parliament are representing the UPFA and therefore, the Opposition Leader position should be given to a UPFA Parliamentarian.
However, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya last week, announced that there will be no change in the post of Opposition Leader.Making a special statement in Parliament, the Speaker said, in accordance with the long-established parliamentary tradition, the leader of the party, which is not a party of the government and holds a majority of members in the opposition, had been accepted as the Leader of the Opposition.
However, Nanayakkara yesterday said, the JO should have the position as it commands the majority in the Opposition.
Meanwhile, SLFP National Organiser, and Irrigation and Water Resources Management and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake on Sunday said, MPs who entered Parliament by contesting elections under the SLFP or UPFA ticket cannot become independent members now.
SLFPers, who wish to become independent, can do so by contesting separately at the next election. Although a section of UPFA members had crossed over to the Opposition when the party was working within the government, their claim to be independent is invalid, he said.
Minister Dissanayake was speaking to the media after calling on the Malwatte and Asgiriya Chief Prelates at their respective Aramayas in Kandy.

Know your audience well, to deliver the right type of songs
Decision making is often seen as the centre of what managers do, something that engages most of a managers time. Decision making can be Strategic decisions, Management control decisions or Operational control decisions. The first type involves a group of high-level managers. The second  mid-level managers and the third, rest of the managers.
Making decisions is not a single event but a series of activities taking place over time.
4 stages
Management gurus describe 4 stages in decision making: intelligence, design, choice and implementation.
Intelligence involves identifying the problems: why and where they occur with what effects. This broad set of information gathering activities is required to inform managers how well the organisation is performing and where problems exist.
Designing many possible solutions to the problems is the second phase of decision making. This phase may require more intelligence to decide if a particular solution is appropriate. Here, more carefully specified and directed information activities and capabilities focused on specific designs are required.
Choosing among alternative solutions is the third step in the decision-making process. Here a manager needs an information system which can estimate the costs, opportunities and consequences of each alternative problem solution. The information system required at this stage is likely to be fairly complex, because of the detailed analytic models required to calculate the outcomes of the various alternatives.
Implementing is the final stage in the decision-making process. Here, managers can install a reporting system that delivers routine reports on the progress of a specific solution, some of the difficulties that arise, resource constraints, and possible remedial actions. Table 9.1 illustrates the stages in decision making and the general type of information required at each stage.
In practice, the stages of decision making do not necessarily follow a linear path from intelligence to design, choice and implementation. At any point in the decision-making process it may be necessary to loop back to a previous stage. Another scenario would be that having implemented a decision one quickly receives feedback indicating that it is not proving effective. Again, the decision maker may have to repeat the design and/or choice stage(s).
Thus, it can be seen that information system designers have to consider the needs of managers at each stage of the decision-making process. Each stage has its own requirement.
MkIS
In todays Business world, changes happen so quickly it is hard to keep up, for example, changes in how customers feel, changes with channel partners, emerging technologies, new media technologies, political and economic changes etc. In short, we need to move really fast. Real-time requires up-to-the-minute information about the marketing environment and the company performance. To exploit and pro-act on information, powerful marketing information systems (MkIS) are needed.
A MkIS is a key management tool designed to support marketing decision making. It brings together many different kinds of data, people, equipment and procedures to help an organization make better decisions. MkIS not only indicates how things are going, but also why and where performance is failing to meet the plan. These reports include near real-time performance of cost centres and projects with detail sufficient for individual accountability. MkIS produces fixed, regularly scheduled reports to middle and operational level managers to identify and inform changes. The ingredients for a good MIS are consistency, completeness, and orderliness.
Importance
MkIS can be classified under four headings:
1.Planning systems - provide information on sales, costs and competitive activity, together with any kind of information which is needed to formulate plans.
2.Control systems - provide continuous monitoring of marketing activities and enable marketing executives to identify problems and opportunities in the marketplace. At the same time, they permit a more detailed and comprehensive review of performance against plans.
3.Marketing research systems - such systems allow executives to test decision rules and cause/effect hypotheses. This permits the assessment of the effects of marketing actions and encourages improved learning from experience.
4.Monitoring systems - these systems provide management with information concerning the external environment in which they are operating.
Developing a marketing information system is not easy and can take several months. Central to a marketing information system is the concept a database. There may be one or more databases present in such a system. The determination of this is a technical matter and it is difficult to state any hard and fast rules on this point.
Clearly, the kind of information held in the database should reflect how the organization segments its market. Indeed, many firms supply goods and services to more than one market so that the database will have to be organized in such a way that the individual markets can readily be identified. Not only does current quantitative information have to be held in the database but so also do past data. Without a substantial number of years data it is difficult to forecast changes in the future.
Closely related to the information held on the market itself is information held on competition and on prospects and clients. In the case of competition, it is important to have information on sales/market share and profitability of products by market segment. It is also useful to hold data on what competitors commit in the way of resources to products - classified by market segment.
Armed with this information the organization can then analyze the data in the database and assess strengths and shortcomings of a competitors product-market portfolio. Information about competitive strategy is more difficult to obtain.
Components
There are five main components of Marketing Information System (MkIS):
1. Internal Records,
2. Marketing Intelligence,
3. Marketing Research
4. Marketing Decision Support System.
5. Marketing models
Internal records: Marketing managers get lots of information from the internal-records of the company. These records provide current information about sales, costs, inventories, cash flows and account receivable and payable. Many companies maintain their computerized internal records. Inside records help marketing managers to gain faster access to reliable information.
Marketing intelligence: This collects information from external sources. It provides information about current marketing-environment and changing conditions in the market. This information can be easily gathered from external sources like; magazines, trade journals, commercial press, personal chats with decision makers and so on. The salesmens report also contains information about market trends. The information which is collected from the external sources cannot be used directly. It must be first evaluated and arranged in a proper order.
Marketing research: Marketing Research is conducted to solve specific marketing problems of the company. It collects data about the problem. This data is tabulated, analysed and conclusions are drawn. Then the recommendations are given for solving the problem. Marketing research also provides information to the marketing managers. However, this information is specific information. It can be used only for a particular purpose.
Marketing decision support system: These are the tools which help the marketing managers to analyse data and to take better marketing decisions. They include hardware, i.e. computer and software programs. Computer helps the marketing manager to analyse the marketing information. There are many software programs, which help the marketing manager to do market segmentation, price fixing, advertising budgets, etc.
Marketing models
These models may be computerized or may not. Typical tools are: Time series sales modes,Brand switching models, Elasticity models (price, incomes, demand, supply, etc.), Regression and correlation models, Analysis of Variance models, Sensitivity analysis, Discounted cash flow Spreadsheet what if models
Setting-up
If you want to set up a Marketing Information system process, there are 4 steps to follow:
Step 1. Determine what metrics to include in your marketing information system.
All data has a cost, both real and opportunity costs, so including the right metrics is critical. If you measure the wrong metrics, youll make bad decisions and waste money. Measure too many metrics and the analysis become difficult. Just because you can measure something, doesnt mean you should. Remember  Data is only worth its cost when the value it contributes to improved decision-making outweighs the cost of collecting the data  and be sure to include the human cost of gathering and analysing this data to other costs in acquiring the data.
Step 2. Gather relevant data.
Data may come from internal sources or external sources. They may also come from competitor sources, listening post metrics, and Facebook Insights. Your marketing research data can also form part of your marketing information system, such as recurring surveys of customer satisfaction.
Step 3. Plot data.
Its very difficult to make decisions based on raw data because the data contains invisible patterns that might otherwise indicate appropriate actions. For instance, its hard to see a downward trend in customer satisfaction without graphing the data until the decline is substantial and by then it might be too late to reverse the trend. Plotting data allows managers to quickly detect changes in critical metrics over time. Newer data visualization software makes the job even easier.
Step 4. Communicate results.
The more people who have the information from your marketing information system, the better. But, not everyone is going to understand tables of raw data or even visualizations. Thats because your marketing information system requires interpretation through the lens of marketing knowledge.
Step 5. Make marketing decisions.
Define idea or problem to be acted upon. Evaluate relevant information about the problem. Develop possible alternative solutions. Select the preferred or best alternative.
Sometimes the preferred alternative involves cost/benefit analysis and risk analysis. Estimate what each alternative will cost in terms of human, physical and financial resources against the expected benefits. Compare the two estimates and select the one with the greatest payoff where the ratio of benefits to cost is more favourable.
In Risk Analysis, estimate which one has the inherent possibility of defeat, disadvantage or loss. Try to minimize the risks involved by effectively forecasting outcomes and considering all variables involved. When all factors are considered, implement the decision. Follow-up, evaluate, and make changes if needed.

Kohli says India should be better after Lords debacle
LONDON, Sunday - Virat Kohli said India should be "better than that" after an innings and 159-run hammering by England in the second Test at Lord's on Sunday.
The heaviest defeat of Kohli's reign as India captain was completed after tea on the fourth day, with his side now 2-0 down in a five-match series.
Yet in a fixture marred by rain -- Thursday's first day was completely washed out -- India were effectively defeated inside two standard days' playing time.
Their batsmen were left helpless as Joe Root's attack, led by spearhead James Anderson, made the most of the overcast and typically English swing-friendly conditions, with India dismissed for just 107 and 130.
Significantly, India's two innings were completed in 82.2 overs, while England batted just the once while making 396 for seven declared in 88.1 overs.
India, for all they are number one in the Test rankings, have long faced accusations they are 'lions at home and lambs abroad'.
In the past five years, they have won just one of their six previous Test series outside of Asia -- and that was against a struggling West Indies.
Meanwhile this latest reverse meant India had won a mere six of their 59 Tests in England.
There is no doubt modern fixture schedules often conspire against touring teams. Nevertheless, the Board of Control for Cricket in India agreed to a programme where Kohli's men had a solitary red-ball warm-up match against Essex ahead of five Tests in some six weeks. And on the eve of the Essex fixture, long-agreed as a four-day game, the match was reduced to a three-day game at India's request.
But regardless of scheduling concerns, Kohli said India had to improve on a Lord's batting display where number eight Ravichandran Ashwin, primarily an off-spinner, top-scored in both their innings with 29 and 33 not out.
"It's our job and our duty to play for the country, and we should be better than that," insisted Kohli, the number one-ranked batsman in both Tests and one-day internationals. "Unless you accept that, you can't improve and compete. We have to accept what we did wrong -- mistakes have been made -- and not repeat them again."
He added: "Credit has to go to England who were clinical with the bat, ball and in the field. They deserved to win and we deserved to lose."
Kohli was clearly struggling with a stiff back on Sunday, the injury seeing him bat at number five rather than his usual number four position. And he received prolonged on-field treatment before he was dismissed by Stuart Broad for 17.
"As of yesterday (Saturday) it was not great," said Kohli, who scored 200 runs including an innings of 149, his maiden Test century in England, during India's 31-run defeat in the series-opener at Edgbaston.  AFP

Lanka Ashok Leyland records Rs 3.2 bn revenue in 1Q-2018
Lanka Ashok Leyland recorded a turnover of Rs 3.2 billion in the first quarter of 2018, against Rs 3.3 billion for the first quarter of 2017.
Vehicle sales saw a marginal decline year on year to Rs 3 billion whilst revenue from other sources rose 44% to R 118.4 million against Rs 82 million for the same period last year. Prudent cost controls boosted the gross profit by 22% to Rs 308 million and saw the gross profit margin expand to 9.7% against 7.8% recorded a year ago.
Operating expenses for the quarter stood at Rs 138.9 million , a 172% increase over the first quarter of 2017 which was benefitted from a one off reversal. Net finance costs for the quarter rose 553% to Rs 67.2 million as we took on more debt to expand our stock of technologically superior BS3 compliant vehicles with latest safety standards. Inventory position grew 30% to Rs 5.7 billion cf. 4.4 billion in the first quarter of 2017 while interest bearing liabilities have risen 99% to Rs 4.1billion against Rs 2 billion a year ago.
The increase in finance resulted in a profit before tax of Rs 51.7mn versus Rs 135.5mn in 1Q 2017, signifying a 51% decline year on year.
Umesh Gautam, CEO of Lanka Ashok Leyland, relayed that the first quarters sales performance has historically been sluggish over the last few years.
This quarter witnessed larger than normal exchange rate volatility which affected pricing and influenced our customers buying decisions. Despite these constraints, our vehicle sales continued to top the Rs 3 billion benchmark. Our bottom line does not fairly reflect the progress the company has made over the quarter which witnessed margin expansion at the gross profit level and saw income from other sources like repairs, hiring and spare parts grow 44%. This restructuring of our revenue profile will reduce exposure to cyclical sales and improve our overall financial position.
On the future outlook Gautam comments that the transportation sector will see the impact of the EURO 4 standard implementation coming into play in July 2018. We commend the government in its efforts to go green however commercially, transportation business models run on very thin margins and are cost sensitive. Higher initial investment in purchase of the vehicles and use of cheaper fuels in vehicles will be replaced by super diesel as required by EURO 4 engines adversely impacting running costs and profitability of the sector.

Lanka go into todays T20I with confidence
Sri Lanka hope to carry the confidence they gained from beating South Africa in the last two ODIs into todays one-off T20 international at the R Premadasa Stadium commencing 7 pm.
Were hoping to win because weve got some confidence from the last two wins and were hoping to take that into the T20I. We have a good team as well, so I trust we can win, said Sri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews.
The match winner for Sri Lanka in Sundays 178-run victory over South Africa in the fifth and final was spinner Akila Dananjaya who ran through the Proteas batting taking six wickets.
He is bound to play another major role if Sri Lanka is to win today.
There is a big difference when you consider Akilas debut, and you look at him now. He bowls with a lot of confidence. Hes not afraid to bowl his variations. And those variations are now also bowled with a lot of control. So those add up to a big difference, said Mathews.

## Title: Lets not go again
## Supertitle: Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again
## Section: T&C
## Date: Tuesday, August 14, 2018 - 01:00
Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again
Lets not go again
Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again feels like Hollywood producers rummaged through the fridge that is ABBAs music and tried to make a dish out of leftovers. Some of those leftovers are decent, most are soggy. But even when the filmmakers revisit old tried and trues- Mamma Mia, Dancing Queen- theyve lost their zest.
Without Meryl Streep, how could we expect any different
Early on in this sequel/prequel to the 2008 film, we learn that Donna (played by Streep) has died (for the record, there is no explanation as to how). Her daughter, Sophie has reopened her seaside hotel on the Greek Island of Kalokairi in Donnas honour.
Like the first film, where the plot oriented around Sophies wedding and the budding question of which of her three fathers will walk her down the aisle, the second film also orients itself around another big event: the unveiling of the Bella Donna Hotel.
But years later, the suspense-building question that drove the action of first film and the escalating triangle of tensions between Donna, her three long-lost lovers, and her daughter Sophie has been replaced by a much less stirring plot: flashback scenes to Donnas post college graduation escapade through Europe.
As Donnas friends and family cope with her death in a seriousness that feels distant from the gaiety of the first film, we see the chronicles of Donnas three love affairs- the blonde Swedish boater, Bill; the awkward alternative rocker Brit, Harry; and her ultimate love interest, the charming, Sam.
Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again features a mix of less remarkable ABBA songs blended with anthems from the first iteration of the Broadway play-turned-blockbuster. The result is dismal, with barely half the energy of the original hit.
Where the energy does pop up is in the disposition of Lily James, who plays young Donna, a soul-searching, frivolous young graduate. But her vivacious nature and propensity for shrieking feels a far cry from the more measured performance of Streep in the first film.
But, fear not- the movie is not missing all its stardom. As if to toss in one household name for another, the producers threw in Cher, playing as Donnas mother, which is not just illogical- Donna says her mother is dead and a staunch catholic in the first film- but actively ruins any sort of flow in the plot.
Cher is three years older than Streep- making this already implausible role decidedly absurd.
She arrives at the opening party by chopper, wearing a sparkling suit, like a martian deployed from a UFO. Her rigid posture and language is a stark and unwelcome contrast to the ebb and flow of the ocean tides and parallel attitude of other major characters. The green screen looks as old as Chers music. From the moment of her industrial-militaristic arrival, the plot deconstructs into surreal oblivion.
If the musical composition in Mamma Mia is a stew made of leftovers, Cher as Donna (Streep)s mother is substituting salt for sugar in a recipe.
Sequels are always a tough go around, catering more to the pockets of Hollywood than fans of the original. This one is particularly rough. You eliminate the tour-de-force that is Meryl Streep, you scrounge through the 80s Swedish pop music for any gems that havent already been used, and all for a film about Americans prancing around on an Greek island, with no regard for the local history or implications of their tourism. What could go wrong
Well some things went right
Mamma Mia treats female sexuality with an easy, subtle acceptance. It doesnt cry out female empowerment in an activist-y way, but with casual references to female desire. Largely courtesy of Tanya, one of Donnas best friends, who delivers a handful of show-stopping sexual comments with nonchalance and simple confidence, an intergenerational reckoning with sexuality is treated with levity and grace.
Much like the first film, in Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again, women are at the center- female friendships, a mother-daughter relationship, and women, of all ages are active, plot-driving characters.
Serious subject matter underlies the pop anthems and sprawling seascapes, but it feels natural-- like maybe, for a second, we do live in a world where women drive the plot and expressions of female sexuality are not threatening or taboo.
To praise the film offers for its female sexual empowerment, would be to overlook all that it lacks by way of sexual, ethnic, and cultural diversity. For a film made in 2018, its lack of self awareness, heteronormative tendencies, and all-white cast feels like its more contemporaneous with the traditional garb the Greek locals in the film are wearing.
Producer, Judy Craymer reportedly said, Mamma Mia! makes people comfortable in their own skin, but its worth asking, what people, specifically
Throughout the film, sexual empowerment is really only afforded to white, American characters. There are a sprinkling of people of color, one black female accordion player makes an appearance in scene where a Donna ultimately takes over the stage with a rendition of the song, Mamma Mia.
Greeks remain in the background, speaking so few lines you could count them on one hand. They wear antiquated Greek clothes, as if frozen in time. Nothing more than pieces of the setting, they function like souvenirs of an intercontinental find yourself conquest.
For a film that features a bunch of Americans dancing to Swedish pop music, on a Greek island (that was actually filmed in Croatia), it is strikingly myopic and geographically neutral.
There is just one, albeit subtle, allusion to the current economic turmoil plaguing contemporary Greece.
A fisherman says he and his fellow fishers have been feeling low because they are struggling financially. Bill, one of Sophies dads, invites them to a party and their worries seem to disappear into thin air. It is a glimmer of self awareness in an otherwise blissfully ignorant film.
Donna is an exemplar of the find yourself trope at the heart of much of Western tourism. She comes to an island and claims it as her own, indulging in the beauty of it (One thing you could not count on a single hand is how many times she babbles about this beautiful place!), but with little regard for the people and history.
All it would have taken was one little scene with one of the many Greek waiters or her landlady who generously and unbelievably gave her a farmhouse for free (so long as she makes it beautiful!). But instead, we got a display of American tourism at its most ignorant and unaware to the tune of Swedish pop music.
The film was fun, but its 2018, you would think Hollywood would be a bit more thoughtful by now.

## Title: MAHINDA WIJESINGHE
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Sports
## Date: Tuesday, August 14, 2018 - 01:00
MAHINDA WIJESINGHE
continued from last week
At the end of the first full season (in 1957), Mahinda developed a life-long injury to his left shoulder which, after a month in hospital, basically left him completely impaired as far as a left-arm spinner was concerned. Advised by his doctors that he can no longer continue playing the game Mahinda was shattered. However the game had seeped into him too far. Then he realized the only way to get back into the game was to develop as a batsman  a left-hander.
By the end of the school season he not only won the School Bowling prize but he, along with left-hand batsman Michael Dias, were picked for a Combined Schools Cricket XI. However the injury had taken its toll on Mahindas arm and he lost out in playing the 1958 season for Royal, but he came back to get his colours in the 1959 season. This was the season where Royal had 12 colours men including eleven members of that side who each had scored a half-century and all others - other than the wicket-keeper of that team had captured at least one wicket. No wonder Royal enjoyed a rollicking season.
After leaving school Mahinda joined Bloomfield C.& A. C. and was selected for the P.Saravanamuttu Trophy XI as an opening batsman. On his debut, he opened the batting with Lucky Abeywardene against the Tamil Union at the Oval, and records showed that he had scored 66 runs in an opening partnership of over a hundred runs. This form continued. In an unprecedented run of batting form he went onto win Mercantile Batting prizes in the A, B, C & D divisions on more than one occasion.
However, he takes more pride in his contributions for the game rather than his personal skills on the field. This is best described by David Miller  Chairman of the Association of Cricket Statisticians &Historians who described Mahinda as follows:
A REMARKABLE MAN
Mahinda Wijesinghe is a remarkable man. He led the way in proposing a link between on-field umpires and television cameras. Then, when MCCs Laws included an incorrect conversion from imperial to metric in the weight of the junior cricket ball with profound implications for ball manufacturers, it was Mahinda whose persistence helped to bring about a correction. It was he who challenged the games law-makers to ban the use of wicket-keeping gauntlets with webbing that had started to give keepers an unfair advantage. It was Mahinda again behind the development of a device to encase the arm of MuttiahMuralidaran, a device that helped to demonstrate that Muralis arm does not straighten in the delivery action..
CF119X6
Wales
December 2007.
It was also pleasant to observe the gift Murali has given Mahinda for his assistance in helping him get over his problem by a gift of a shirt with many compliments written on it. Mahinda has framed it and this hangs very proudly in his gallery. Along with that is another photograph of Don Bradman, autographed personally by the great man to Mahinda. Another photograph is that of himself and Englands fast bowler Frank Tyson 'engaged in a deep conversation. The third photograph is that of himself, secretary of the Sri Lanka Cricket Foundation, Sir Garfield Sobers and Chairman of the SLCF Gamini Dissanayake.
Now in order to get an opinion from Mahinda about the current situation in Sri Lanka Cricket it was rather difficult. However reluctantly he agreed. Referring to the fact that all our past greats refused to comment on this situation, Mahinda said, that by itself is your answer. Yes he said we are now in a situation where I cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel.
For instance, why are the Selectors  and possibly other important members of the SLC who wield a lot of power  still seemed to be insisting on playing Angelo Mathews who on his own admission is nursing an injury for the past several seasons An uninspiring leader fielding in the first slip position serves no purpose, especially when he is refusing to appear at the bowling crease as well. Now he says that within in the next couple of months he hopes (mind you these are mere hopes!) return to the bowling crease. In other word he is admitting that he is carrying an injury which in itself indicates he is not fit to play in the team  and is setting a bad example.
The above statements made by Mahinda Wijesinghe may sound harsh, however coming from a man who has an impeccable track record both home and abroad should never be taken lightly.Is it not a good idea to give Mahinda his due place in the cricketing fraternity in Sri Lanka Over to you the men up above!!
In conclusion I would like to state that men of Mahinda Wijesinghes calibre are a dying breed who never wanted to join the gravy train. He respected the game first and foremost.Tina Turner in her hit saw of the past sang Hes simply the best , better than all the rest. Mahinda fits the bill.

Mutual musical musings
Resonance is all about dreams, memories, authenticity and energy. These are a group of Familians who go back a long way. Melodies speaks to Judith Fernando on Resonance, a relatively new choir group who are always looking to take it to the next level.
Passionate about music, these girls are very talented and though they have many obligations, they never forget what initially brought them together  music.
Were a group of talented and super passionate girls whose mutual musical roots go back to non other than Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya, where we all sang together at some point for roughly 8 years, under the guidance of our Choral Directress Rapti Fernando, said Fernando.
Although competing for The Asia Pacific Choir Games in 2017 was what initially brought them together, creating and performing together was always the focal point.
We all met at HFC but, after leaving school our lives obviously took us down different paths. Individually, were all from different backgrounds. Our interests, purposes and careers differ so much but, one thing we all have in common is the unwavering Love for Music. Which is the main reason we all decided to create Resonance, explained Fernando.
A little rusty after having been away from singing, because of many obligations, the girls soon clicked and soon gained momentum.
Getting back in vocal shape was one. Many of us had not been practicing or singing after leaving school so we had to get down to basic training and keep pushing ourselves to raise the bar, constantly keeping the momentum despite having so many other obligations towards family, work and studies. Its all paying off though, because were sounding our best yet at the moment, pointed out Fernando.
The group soon made a name for themselves and started to enjoy success. They have achieved recognition in a short while.
Our passion for Music has resonated with many so far. Weve been approached to perform and sing for a number of exclusive events and weddings within the past year and the response has been great. Were humbled and inspired! Though a relatively new choir, many have heard about us and associate our performances to the various genres of singing & the collaboration of dancing that we do, added Fernando.
Versatile and enthusiastic they are not limited to one genre. They just love music overall and consider it something worth pursuing.
We dont have a label or fixed genre. Our girls are multi-talented and are interested in various genres spanning from Pop, hip hop, show, gospel to Jazz and Metal. Some of our girls are trained Musicians, some are professional singers with experience in performing in theatre and we even have the countrys first female Metal Soloist. The choir mostly sings in four part harmony so, were proud to say we love to create our own, unique renditions of songs. But, maybe well make a few of our own in the future, explained Fernando.
Fernando stated that the goal is to use their talents to resonate and make a difference in the music industry.
As individuals we like to contribute more towards the afore mentioned ambition of Resonance and we accept all Past Familians, depending on their talent in singing. Our message to any young musician trying to come up in the field is -Find ways of enhancing your musical talents. Find people who could be your inspiration and have a passion for something better than what you have already done. Be unique, said Fernando.
The girls are constantly looking at how to better themselves. They are looking at taking Resonance to a place where they can utilize their full potential.
Resonance can be booked for weddings and events and we usually have a few gigs a month. We look forward to taking on gigs that come our way because of the new experiences and level of enhancement we make through each of them, said Fernando.
Inspiration is the first step in the journey. The rest is commitment. And commitment can only be translated into success when you have the energy.
Were all individually inspired by different genres but we think it all boils down to the energy, authenticity and feel of a song. All kinds of music could be an inspiration depending on the way its sung and the emotion put into making an impact on the listener, stated Fernando.
The girls are more than capable of writing their own lyrics. They are just looking for the correct time.
We normally purchase our scores and music depending on the requirement and preference of the girls. We havent written any lyrics so far but, were sure one of our skillful choristers can jump right into it whenever needed, summed up Fernando.

Piramal Glass Ceylon revenue increases by 17.5% in Q1- F19
Piramal Glass Ceylon PLC has announced its results for the 1st Quarter of FY 2018-19 with Rs. 1,649 million of revenue with Rs. 86 million of profit before tax.
The revenue during the 1st three months of FY2018-19 was Rs. 1,649 million, which reflects a growth of was 17.5% when compared to the similar period of previous year revenue of Rs. 1,403 million.
The Domestic sale stood at Rs. 1,016 million as against Rs. 1,084 million of the similar quarter of the previous year, reflecting a de-growth of 8%. This decline has continued in the domestic market for the 2nd consecutive year. The major impact came thru the liquor segment. Over the past two years a shift of consumption was observed from the high end locally filled foreign liquor segment to the low end liquor. This was further aggravated with the heavy taxes imposed on the liquor industry.
The high end liquor segment of the industry uses the new bottles whilst the low end uses the used scrapped bottles. Thus this shift has impacted the demand of fresh bottles.
The company has entered into the retail segment with the launch of glass bottles within the category of food & water. Several innovative designs and options are now available for house hold consumption. Currently the products are available at
This has opened an avenue for a new category of business. This venture is to support the worldwide green initiative of protecting the environment & for the wellbeing of our future generation by providing alternative to plastics & PET.
Exports
The Export sales for the quarter grew by 98% to Rs. 633 million as against the Rs. 319 million in the similar quarter. This is 39% of the overall sales value as against 23% in the previous year 1st Quarter. The company did its best to fill the excess capacity created with the decline in the domestic market thru exports. Most of the orders obtained at short notice from the mass market as capacity fillers did not yield the same attractive margins as the domestic & high niche segment of the exports. The company continuously strives towards gradually shifting the volumes from the mass market to the premium segment.
Presently company is exporting to USA, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, India, Pakistan, Myanmar & several other markets. A significant growth has been experienced in the USA & Canadian markets.

Police arrest 17 members of sword gangs in North
As a result of the ongoing special operations conducted in the North to apprehend and control the sword gangs, 17 persons have been arrested from the Manippai area, according to the Police Media Spokesmans Office. In addition, the Police have also seized three motorbikes and two swords that belonged to these arrested gang members.
The suspects were produced before the Mallakam courts and two of the suspects were released on bail, while the others were ordered to be remanded.
According to Northern Province Senior DIG Roshan Fernando, Police operations have been taking place to arrest such gang members who terrorise the people, but once they are produced in court, they are most often released on bail. They return to their respective gangs subsequently, but sometimes they are not willingly, but, forced to do so and sometimes threatened and attacked if they refuse. The DIG also noted that some of these sword attacks take place between the various gangs.
The sword wielding gangs has been suspected to have been engaged in crimes including robbery and kidnapping.
Since the end of the civil war, there have been a large increase in the drug trade, sexual and gang violence, and robberies in the North.
Hence, the Police have stepped up their surveillance and conducted special operations, especially in the areas with the highest number of sword related incidents in Kopai, Manipai and Chavakachcheri.

Prison inmates issues to be investigated soon: Thalatha
Measures had been taken to launch an investigation to look into matters concerning prison inmates, recently, Justice and Prison Reforms Minister Thalatha Atukorale said.
Minister Atukorale told the Daily News that so far, prisons had lacked a proper methodology in which prioners could make submissions with regard to the issues they face, adding that the idea had received negative feedback.
In order to meet the grievances of prison inmates, an island-wide programme would be implemented soon, in order to resolve inconveniences faced by inmates, the minister said.
Under the said programme, attention would also be given to helping inmates who possess creative and/or innovative abilities, she added. Referring to prison intelligence, the Justice minister said it had been revealed that the Prisons Department had neither paid proper attention nor taken appropriate action, to respond to certain reports that had been previously submitted.
She added that she would decide whether the Prison Intelligence Unit would continue or not, as it was an issue that required special attention.
Minister Thalatha Atukorale, addressing on matters concerning capital punishment, said that a final decision had not been reached regarding the topic, adding that discussions were still being conducted.
She said that several individuals had applied for the executioners post.

Villagers said vehicles were at risk as there were no gatekeepers present. They added that the gates were kept open always for both trains and vehicles.
The road is used by more than 2,000 families in villages around the Rosette Estate. As the road has bends near the railway crossing at Uduwara, which is located between the Demodara and Hali-Ela Stations, pedestrians and vehicles are at risk. As the gates were set up on either sides only recently, gatekeepers had not been employed. Residents request the relevant authorities to deploy guards to the crossing before an accident occurs.

Root hails special commodity Anderson as England go 2-0 up against India
LONDON, Sunday - Joe Root said James Anderson was a "special commodity" who should be enjoyed for as long as possible after England's leading all-time Test wicket-taker showed his class yet again in an innings and 159-run hammering of India at Lord's.
The overcast conditions and green-tinged pitch, as much a consequence of a sudden change in the weather after a prolonged dry spell as anything else, were ideal for Anderson. But the 36-year-old Lancashire swing specialist exploited them expertly in a match haul of nine for 43 that saw him become the first bowler to take 100 Test wickets at Lord's.
"He's a special, special commodity, isn't he," said Root of Anderson after England won the second Test in emphatic fashion to go 2-0 up in a five-match series.
"He's something that doesn't come along very often and we've got to enjoy him while he's around," he added.
"There's been chat about his longevity but at the minute he's bowling better than he ever has before. Time and again, he puts in fantastic performances.
"For him to be performing as he is, is something else.
"Even though the conditions suited (him), you've still got to put the ball in the right area and ask the right questions of the batters.
"Throughout the whole game he did just that, he set the tone well with Stu (Broad), as a whole bowling group we were really, really good."
'OUTSTANDING' WOAKES
Yet it was Chris Woakes who was named man-of-the-match after starring with both bat and ball. Woakes, selected after England omitted Ben Stokes because of his fellow pace-bowling all-rounder's ongoing trial for affray, made 137 not out -- his maiden Test century -- and shared a partnership of 189 with Jonny Bairstow (93) that helped the hosts recover from 89 for four to an eventual total of 396 for seven declared. He also took match figures of four for 43, with his haul including the prize scalp of India captain and star batsman Virat Kohli, his erstwhile team-mate when they both played for the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League, for just 23 in the tourists' meagre first-innings 107.
It is not yet known whether Stokes will be available to play in the third Test in Nottingham starting Saturday, but Warwickshire's Woakes proved himself to be far more than a mere 'stand-in'.
"Ben is obviously a huge part of this squad, so it's a miss him not being here this week," said Root.
"But what it did was create an opportunity for Chris to come in and perform -- and boy, he didn't disappoint did he
"He was outstanding. That's something we really want to harness as an example to the guys in and around the squad -- when you get your chance, make it as hard as possible to leave you out.
"It's a great headache to have for us, going into next week."
Only once in the 141-year history of Test cricket have a side come from 2-0 down to win a five-match series, when an Australia side inspired by batting great Donald Bradman rallied to beat England back in 1936/37. But Root, having seen England beat India by just 31 runs in a see-saw first Test at Edgbaston, was in no mood to take anything for granted.
"India are doing everything they can, but...we've given them nothing. I don't see any lack of fight, or lack of trying (from them).
"Obviously, it would be a dream to put in five complete performances and have five wins. But it's important we don't get complacent, arrogant."  AFP

Sanga rejects speculation on Presidential bid
Former Sri Lanka cricket captain Kumar Sangakkara rejecting all speculation of him contesting the Presidential Election in 2020 insisted that he does not harbour any ambitions for political office.
Sangakkara in a lengthy post in his Facebook account on Sunday said; I would like to put to rest speculation and rumour once and for all, confirming that I do not harbour any ambitions for political office. I never have, and, with enormous certainty, I can say I never will.
He made the above comment with reference to varying opinions and speculations on his imminent entry into politics as a possible candidate for the presidential election in 2020.
While I have no political ambitions, I do hope that we Sri Lankans have the patience and foresight to not only vote the best-suited and most-qualified persons into public office, but also thereafter retain patience as positive social and economic change will not be achieved overnight. I also hope that we have the strength to continuously agitate and demand integrity, accountability, transparency and respect from our elected politicians, ensuring they fully appreciate and understand that they are entrusted with our will to be exercised with responsibility in a manner that benefits all in our society equally, he commented.
Sangakkara went on to comment that politics and public service are serious responsibilities that should be served with accountability and integrity holding sacrosanct the public trust.
I have the greatest respect for those public servants, whether elected or appointed, who are motivated by good and honourable intentions and are therefore steadfastly committed to the betterment of our country, he noted.
Post cricket, my plan is, first and foremost, to focus on my family after many years of sacrifice on their part while I was away playing cricket around the world. I am also looking forward to the challenge of developing a second post-playing career in an exciting new phase of my life. Finally, I wish to continue to work with existing charitable partners and friends striving to help various disadvantaged sections of our community. I am forever inspired by the selfless and passionate leaders and volunteers driving these charitable organisations forward and I will try my hardest to support their wonderful efforts in meaningful and useful ways, he added.

SARCAS Sessions conclude
The sixth South Asias Regional Civil Affairs Seminar - 2018 (SARCAS), that brought all military officers specialised in civil-military operations, humanitarian assistance professionals and disaster response practitioners in the Asian region, drew to a close at Hotel Movenpick in Colombo 3, last Friday afternoon.
Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, at the invitation of the Defence Cooperation Office in the American Embassy in Sri Lanka and the Defence Ministry, delivered the concluding remarks to the five-day long conference co-hosted by the Special Operation Command Pacific (SOCPAC) and the Sri Lanka Army. Lieutenant General Senanayake, in his closing remarks, said that the Sri Lanka Armys rescue and relief roles would receive a stimulant following the knowledge it received as a result of the deliberations in the seminar of special relevance.
It was interesting to note here that during the most recent spate of landslides, floods, natural disasters and all other emergencies, it was the army who showed up first and provided relief to victims and took every measure possible to minimise the gravity of the situations, he said.
What we gained from these sessions will further help improve our professional standards and technical skills, for which I thank the organisers of this dialogue for the sixth consecutive year in Colombo, the Commander remarked. SARCAS in Colombo was attended by representative practitioners from Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Nepal, Indonesia, Maldives, Cambodia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and the US and focused on Preparation and Mitigation of Disasters, Immediate Responses, Preventing Humanitarian Crisis, Long-Term Recovery and Development and Looking to the Future, followed by different sub themes of related spheres.
Arrangements to this effect were made jointly by the Army Directorate of Psychological Operations commanded by Brigadier Athula Hennadige and the US Embassy in Sri Lanka, with the participation of more than 38 tri-service representatives of the above-mentioned countries.
Towards the conclusion of the sessions, the Army Commander, showing gratitude for hosting the event, awarded souvenirs to five officers who were instrumental in organising the event. US Embassy Defence Attach Lieutenant Colonel Douglas Hess presented a memento to the Army Commander. In addition, all participants were awarded certificates.
Staff Director-General Major General Dananjith Karunaratne, Training Director-General Major General Aruna Wanniarachchi and senior officers participated.
The interactive sessions throughout the seminar would break into small groups on all five days, to produce their own outcome and presentations, borne out of interactive exchange of views.

Seize this moment!
The veteran short story writer Ernest Hemingway of The Old Man and the Sea fame that created the memorable character Santhiago wrote Hills Like White Elephants at a time Europe was passing through a crucial period of moral decadence.
As literary enthusiasts we owe a huge debt of gratitude to this consummate writer for leaving behind a great literary work in the genre of short story for us to read and reread about the repercussions of the modernization in the social system in the wake of urbanization, the legitimate son of industrialization, that ruined the quintessence of tranquility in the pastoral society.
Old order changeth, yielding place to new, so is said by the poet laureate Victorian Poet Alfred Lord Tennyson in his epoch-making epic Morte D Arthur based on the Arthurian Legend. It raises another question to be answered by so-called local politicians have you lived your life
Cultural decline
King Arthur on the eve of leaving for the Island of Avilion after being defeated by the traitors of his own chiefs says to his remaining minister Bedivere I have lived my life. He accepted his defeat and left for the particular where he would regain good health when the salubrious climate make him cured. It is quite disgusting that most of the political leaders do not seem to relinquish power as King Arthur and bask in the past glory of victories, thus ruin themselves in the ephemeral desire of avarice and hunger for power. It is not germane in the context of ongoing politics on any land because of the very fact that the voter is more mature now than before as he is battle-hardened through the vicissitudes of body politics on this paradise isle of political hegemony. Carpe diem was first seen in use in literature in Hemingway's oeuvre. Simply it says seize the day! In using this most accurate term to describe the specific era of moral paralysis in Europe, the couples some other words for us to gain insight into the ongoing cultural decline. The German term of lexicology Zeitgeist was used by the writer to denote the general mood or quality of a particular period of a history as shown by the ideas, beliefs etc., and common at the time. In other words, the spirit of the time. Hedonism, pleasure is the most important thing in life, disastrously ruined the life of the youth. In seeking pleasure, they took to Debauchery like the duck to water. They were entangled virtually in an inescapable vicious circle of moral decay.
The American boy and the European girl Jig in the aforementioned piece of short story Hills like white elephants went on their pleasure-seeking spree she became pregnant, not with thoughts, but with a child. To evade the moral obligation of legitimate fatherhood, the American boy leaves no stone unturned to abuse modern medical technology to abort the child. His naked attempt to do so is adroitly depicted by the writer for the reader to ponder on. My eye caught this piece of the masterpiece in the genre of short story in my random browsing over my golden collection of world literature which I persistently use to analyse the status quo of my paradise isle that I could dare say I love my country.
In my view, little lions in little Lanka could observe a spiralling wave of crime and an unprecedented precipitous moral paralysis not in uncertain terms. Time is opportune for the writers of all the genres to come forward to rescue the nation from the tentacles of social evils before they become more complicated to tackle.
Short-sighted politics for temporary gains ought to be nailed and the politicians could be given an amnesty period to go back to their roots and confess how much money they have amassed from the national coffers. How much time they have spent to glorify themselves for personal glory on taxpayers account. They could revisit their history of debauchery that has brought international ill-fame to the country of their birth. The clergy could meditate whether they have catered to the religious emancipation of the laity or more inclined towards the mundane desire of avarice as the veteran poet George Herbert aptly explained in his poem Avarice.
Abuse political power
The common man could ponder on the fact that whether the politicians have exploited their valuable vote to abuse political power to make politics a goldmine.
The cream of the country, the university students could have rethink whether they have answered the call of the nation or merely duped by the bankrupt politicians to have a ride on them to come to power. Our donor countries could examine whether our politicians and the governments have profitably invested their donations for an extra mile in politics or to ameliorate the living conditions of the poor. Our writers could reexamine whether they have used their quill for the intellectual uplift of their readers. Our youth could come forward to give a new lead to the country under the able stewardship of trusted intellectuals. The university academia could guide the posterity to take them off the preposterous track of derailed politics. In conclusion, all the concerned parties could make a concerted effort to regain our pristine glory and one day we would be able to bask in the veritable glory!
The status quo of the country compels me to revisit the period of neoclassical period English of English poetry to gain inspiration to rekindle the national aspirations. It is discernible to this poor soul that the term Carpe Diem has been exploited by all and sundry in the most negative sense.
This is the best of time to do the needful, my dear countrymen!

Being one among 48 pupils was her toughest challenge. The requirement to learn 12 subjects was even worse. Answering the 12 question papers looked almost impossible. Worse still, the duration for one question paper was three hours. Sounds familiar Probably not, if you are not visually impaired!
Hansi Pinipas life offers a grand narrative on how you can cut across the blindness barrier with the rod of determination. The visual disability came for Hansi with a package full of challenges. However, she chose not to give in. Grade I was her first hurdle. The class teacher at Dharmapala College, Pannipitiya, offered her a warm welcome. If not for that warmth, Hansi muses 16 years later, her fate would have taken a different course.
In July 2015, the Oslo Summit on Education for Development brought together members of the international community to discuss renewing and increasing their commitments to education. The event highlighted that the global ambitions of world leaders to eradicate poverty, break the cycle of humanitarian crises and lay the foundation for sustainable development cannot be reached without quality education for all. Sri Lanka is slowly reaching a certain level thanks to the painstaking efforts of stakeholders, the NGOs as well as the Government.
Now in her second year at the Sri Jayawardanapura University reading Mass Communication, Sinhala and Music for her Bachelors, Hansi also serves as an MP in the Youth Parliament representing the disabled community.
In the primary section, especially Grade I and II, much of the class work was carried out in a visual medium. Even the alphabet was taught with the use of visuals, Hansi digs into her recollection storage.
Fortunately for Hansi, her teacher was sensitive to her needs and requirements. The teacher would oftentimes approach the visually impaired, yet receptive, student to spell out her lessons. Most often she would keep the pupil at close range to the table. She was never to overlook her. Whenever the teacher held out a visual object to the batch, she would let Hansi feel the same. Her time at Grade I and II was spent thus, mostly tethered to touching and feeling.
Hansi meets her next challenge with the Scholarship Examination. None of her class teachers had an idea about her capacity. Unbeknownst to them, however, Hansi spent one hour in the Special Unit every day to learn the Braille alphabet. That clothed her with adequate confidence to get along with her peers. Unfortunately, she would not get an opportunity to sit for the Scholarship Exam.
I do not consider it a misfortune though. It was a good opportunity for me to brace myself for the future. I was determined, an encouraged Hansi recalls.
The upper school posed a serious challenge to Hansi. GCE Ordinary Level education means mastering 12 subjects. The mastery of the 12 subjects should be proved in 12 question papers. Each question paper was three hours! But the school was sensitive to her requirement this time. She was delegated to an individual teacher. The teacher would read out all the questions on the paper. She would listen to them and respond in Braille. She made it a point never to be ranked last in the class. She was always ranked between the fifth and the 10th. Finally, she clutched at the opportunity to sit for her first crucial examination, GCE Ordinary Level, at the Rathmalana School for the Deaf and Blind.
I must especially mention my invigilator and her team. They were quite helpful. They read out all the questions. Someone asked me how I remembered all the material necessary for answering. It was a simple technique that I followed, Hansi notes.
In her psychology studies, Hansi has read the benefits of keeping some stimulant in possession. The stimulant comes in handy when you feel down or tired. She would take her favourite perfume to the exam hall and breathe in its scent whenever she feels tired. She passed the exam with four credits and four simple passes.
I chose Arts at the same school for Advanced Level. My teachers were now aware that I would somehow ace the examination and enter the university, Hansi remembers.
Smooth roads never make perfect drivers. It was so for Hansi. Her Mass Communication teacher paved the rough terrain for her to become a perfect driver in life. You only need to pass the exam and you can enter the university, her teacher would often tell her. That was not encouraging, Hansi emphasises today. It was underestimating a student. That only breaks your spirits. The teacher passed that statement as disability is considered at the university entrance.
I was determined to pass the exam with 3As. But I did not want to do it as an attack on my teacher. My results are only 2As and one C, but I am thankful to that very teacher who broke my spirits. If not for her, I would not have come this far.
At the university, Hansi comes across many friends. She gets along with them as a normal student because she has experience of growing up as a normal kid under the normal circumstances. Such experience made her an extraordinary character among her peers.
Ask anyone of my batch about me. You will hardly find anyone who doesnt know me. I am known not because of my disability, but because of my social work, Hansi notes with confidence.
Any visually impaired pupil or a student will have to face discrimination and other challenges when they get along with the peers. This is why they approach the institutes allocated to that particular education need. But Hansi thinks otherwise. In her viewpoint, it is better to let the visually impaired pupils get along with the pupils without disabilities at the mainstream schools. That makes the platform for the pupils without disabilities to familiarise and change their attitudes towards their peers with disabilities.
Then they come to realise that the disability has nothing to do with the mental capacity. Just because you cannot see, hear or move around, it does not mean that you are mentally disabled. You can contribute towards the social development just like the others with all the necessary facilities provided, Hansi explains.
The government, as a major stakeholder, has offered a considerable contribution on ease of access for the disabled, Hansi notes. But the situation has more room to improve with better facilities.
For instance, most websites are not blind-friendly. This affects me as I need internet information to engage in debates. The government can work on advanced software methodologies to make the Internet blind-friendly.

SLTDA removes minimum room rate
Sri Lanka Tourism has decided to remove the minimum room rate (MRR) imposed on Colombo City Hotels, Chairman of Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) Kavan Ratnayaka said.
He said that they have allowed the market forces to decide the room rates rather than the SLTDA dictating terms to them. Ratnayaka addressing a gathering in Colombo yesterday said that it was a temporary move and would be re imposed as and when required.
Speaking at the re launch of Sri Lanka Tourism awards after a lapse of six years he also said that they were in the process of introducing several new entertainment options to the Colombo city to woo more travelers to Colombo. He said that in a bid to encourage this they will also bring in a new tax incentive scheme.
Chairman City Hotels Association Shanthi Kumar said that they have had meetings in this regard with SLTDA and are working towards this.
He also added that they are keen to do away with the informal tourism sector, which he considers as illegal sector to provide better security for tourists.
Meanwhile Minister of Tourism John Amaratunge said that if the country does not have major natural disasters, epidemics and people remain calm they would be able to attract 2.6 million arrivals in 2018 and 3.5 million for 2019.
We are looking at revenue in the excess of US$ 5.9 billion for 2018 end and 6.5 billion for 2019 end and a target of US$ 7 billion for 2020.
He said that there are issues of delays at the Colombo international airport and also lack of capacity for new airlines to fly to Colombo. We hope to address these issues soon and also request airlines to patronize the Mattala international airport as well.
He also said that the tourism promotional budget running in to several million US dollars would be forwarded for Cabinet approval this month and it should be active from September. We will only use funds generated from the Industry (CESS) for this.
Leading business personality Kishu Gomes has been appointed as the head of the Judging committee along with Otara Gunawardane., head of EDB, Indira Malwatte, Chandra Mohotti and Rajeeva Meewenwell. There would be 50 awards presented on December 8 at the tourism awards ceremony.

Speaker receives PEPC recommendations
The Parliament Ethics and Privileges Committee (PEPC) concluded the inquiries into the alleged misconduct of Joint Opposition MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Prasanna Ranaweera and sent recommendations to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya last week for further action.
A Committee member told the Daily News yesterday that the Speaker would have to convene a Party Leaders Meeting and take a final decision based on the committees observations.
The inquiries were following a formal complaint by Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera into the un-Parliamentary conduct of the two members in the House on July 3.
Deputy Minister Perera brought to the attention of the House that the two JO MPs with their foul language and aggressive behaviour threatened the Chair and ridiculed Parliament. According to Committee sources, MP Weerawansa, when he was summoned before the Committee last Thursday, had denied any wrongdoing, adding that he did not intentionally disrespect the Speaker. He had refused to express regrets over the incident.
However, the sources said disciplinary action is likely against MP Ranaweera. Sources pointed out that MP Ranaweera tried to grab the Mace and the new set of Standing Orders of Parliament adopted from April 15 has the provision to impose four weeks suspension on any member who touches the Mace during the sittings. The Committee perused the CCTV footage of the incident on July 5.
The Committee has sent its observations with the responses of the two members, but it is upto the Speaker to take the final decision after discussing with the party leaders, a Committee member said.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya also previously expressed his deep displeasure on the unruly behaviour of MPs Weerawansa and Ranaweera in the House.
Ministers Thilak Marapana, Ranjith Maddumabandara, Gayantha Karunathilake, Mano Ganesan and Faiszer Musthapha, MPs Susil Premajayantha, Douglas Devananda, Anura Dissanayake, E.Saravanapavan and Shanthi Sri Skandarasa are members of the Privileges and Ethics Committee.

Take Abbie Girl, an Australian Kelpie rescue with a real knack for riding a wave. She won a special Spirit of Surfing Award for her performance and her dedication to the sport - and third place honors in the medium-sized dogs category. Owner Michael Uly got his buddy to the contest even though he had broken his foot.
Gidget, a pug who does turns on her board and has 70,000 Instagram fans, grabbed top honors as best little dog surfer, second place for partnering with Prince Dudeman and the Goughnuts Top Dog award.
But all of the 45 contestants in the World Dog Surfing Championships won the hearts of spectators as they braved the ocean in their canine wetsuits. The event raised money for two animal charities.
The third annual championship hosted various categories, including dogs surfing alone, with their owner or with a dog pal. In partnering with another dog, the surfer in front has to be prepared to get doused, like this contestant, Tristan the surfing Westie, in a practice run.

Suspect nabbed in foreign employment scam
A suspect who had swindled a sum of Rs.45 million from persons across the country, while promising them employment in Canada, was arrested by Ahungalla Police recently.
Police arrested him while he had been staying at a hotel in the Marawila area, prepared to go abroad. Police seized cash worth Rs.10.08 million, gold jewellery valued at Rs.260,000 and five mobile phones. The suspects car, worth Rs.7 million, was also taken into custody.
Investigations into the matter had been initiated following a complaint lodged by the suspects driver, and the suspect had been identified as a resident of the Yanthampalawa area in Kurunegala.
It was revealed that the suspect had been staying at the Galvehera Maluwa Viharaya in Ahungalla for some time and had collected money from youths in the area, promising them job opportunities in Canada.
However, he had arrived at Colombo on August 8, to obtain Visas for them before disappearing, police said. The driver said that he had parked the car near Town Hall while waiting for the suspect to return. But he did not, and that was why he lodged a complaint with the police.
Police said that the suspect had published an advertisement in a newspaper, seeking for a temple for temporary accommodations as he had arrived from Canada, police said.
During his stay at the temple, he had presented gifts to residents of the area, while saying that they were from Canada. The car had also been purchased after he had swindled residents of Ahungalla, police added.
Balapitiya Acting Magistrate D. M. Liyakath remanded the suspect until August 21. Ahungalla Police are investigating.

During the second night of her Reputation World Tour shows held at the Rogers Centre, fans went wild after the 58-year-old joined Taylor onstage to sing his classic hit, Summer of 69.
Sang with the gorgeous @taylorswift tonight in #toronto... what a treat. Thanks Taylor! the Canadian crooner posted on Twitter shortly after the sell-out concert.
The 28-year-old singer uploaded videos and photos of her and Bryan in rehearsals too.
I didnt even know Bryan was gonna be in town until last night and I asked him completely last minute if he wanted to come sing!! she wrote alongside a series of clips and snaps on Instagram. Pretty evident from the videos (um yes Im posting another one) that Im FULLY LOSING IT with excitement, and I cant thank Bryan Adams enough.
She later shared exclusive footage of the pair rehearsing, and wrote: Behind the scenes of our secret rehearsal today before @bryanadams surprised Toronto with Summer of 69!!!! SO MUCH FUN TONIGHT TORONTO!!
Her duet with Bryan comes just one day after she treated fans at the Rogers Centre on Friday to an appearance from Shawn Mendes, who hails from Toronto. The 19-year-old spent time backstage with Taylor and opening act Camila Cabello, before ending up in the make-up chair where the Shake It Off hitmaker covered his face in white glittery eyeshadow.
This is pretty much the exact same show look (we do), she told him in a video posted to her Instagram Story. Shawns back and hes glittery. Music News

Twice a fairytale
No, youre not seeing double. Identical twin brothers Josh and Jeremy Salyers proposed to identical twin sisters Brittany and Briana Deane on the 2nd of February (or 2-2), and the couple of couples have just gotten married in a joint ceremony at the 2018 Twins Days Festival in Twinsburg, Ohio. The ceremony was themed Twice Upon a Time, with identical twin ministers leading the way.
Its really been a fairy tale come true. Marrying twins is something thats very important to us, Briana (who married Jeremy) told PEOPLE. She even called the ceremony a double fairy tale. Even when we were little girls I can remember being in kindergarten, knowing that that is what we saw for ourselves. Brittany added, We knew that the chances were incredibly scarce. The stars had to align for our dreams to come true. I get to marry the man of my dreams and at the same time I get to look over next to me and see my twin sister marrying the man of her dreams.
The brides wore matching dresses while the grooms rocked identical tuxedos. The foursome first met last year at the same festival.
Brittany and Briana had been attending it for years, and met Josh and Jeremy on the final day of the 2017 twin gathering. It was their first one.
I remember vividly the first time Brittany and I saw Josh, and Jeremy at the twins festival, Briana said. I also remember the first time we all spoke the last night of the festival. Its sort of like everything was in slow motion.
If they couldnt find identical twin girls that matched up well with them, they were never getting married, Brittany said.
I think that they experienced a lot of the same challenges dating what we call singletons, that means non-twins. Its hard when youre dating someone and they dont understand the twin bond.
If thats not enough, the gang also plan to all live in the same house where they would raise their children together.

US Foreign Military Financing for Lanka
The U.S. Department of State yesterday announced it will provide about $39 million in Foreign Military Financing for Sri Lanka, pending Congressional approval.
We look forward to discussing with the Government of Sri Lanka how this contribution can support our Bay of Bengal initiative and Sri Lankas humanitarian assistance and disaster response priorities, it said in a statement.
The Secretary traveled to Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia last week for bilateral and multilateral meetings to advance the security of the United States and the region, and to underscore our support for a rules-based order, reaffirm our commitment to friends and allies, and demonstrate the robust engagement in the Indo-Pacific.
In Singapore, the Secretary outlined the security pillar of the administrations Indo-Pacific strategy and announced nearly $300 million in additional funding intended for South and Southeast Asia.
Weve gotten a lot of questions about this, so I just wanted to highlight some of what is involved in that program.
Theres been a lot of interest in this, U.S. Department of State Spokesperson Heather Nauert said.
The funding represents a significant investment in our security relationships with Bangladesh, Indonesia, Mongolia, Nepal, the Pacific islands, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and others.
The investment focuses on four key areas that are critical to ensuring a free, open, and rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific region. This includes maritime security, humanitarian assistance, and disaster response, also peacekeeping capabilities and countering transnational crime.
As part of the maritime security theme, we launched the Bay of Bengal Initiative to help enhance the capacity of civilian and military maritime actors in this vital region, which is home to important sea lanes linking the Indian Ocean to East Asia, Nauert added.

U.S. Peace Corps, Education Ministry sign MoU on English education
Secretary to the Education Ministry Sunil Hettiarachchi and U.S. Peace Corps/Sri Lanka Country Director Kris Besch signed a new Memorandum of Understanding on August 9 to formalize support for English education by bringing U.S. Peace Corps Volunteers back to Sri Lanka.
Peace Corps volunteers were present in Sri Lanka from 1962 to 1998. The Peace Corps Crisis Corps, now Peace Corps Response, also assisted in recovery efforts following the 2004 tsunami, the U.S. Embassy said in a press release.
Charg dAffaires to Sri Lanka and Maldives Robert Hilton and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam witnessed the signing at the Education Ministry. Charg Hilton recalled the founding of the Peace Corps by U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961 and its long history of service in Sri Lanka.
The current support for English teaching, he stated, would unlock the doors of opportunity for all Sri Lankans.
The event was attended by leaders in the education sector, government officials, and community members.
The first 25 American Peace Corps Volunteers will arrive in Sri Lanka in late 2019 and undergo three months of comprehensive cultural, language and technical training before they are given their assignments to serve for two years.
Peace Corps efforts in Sri Lanka will focus on English language education and supporting the Education Ministry, schools, and community groups in coordination with the Sri Lankan English Teachers Association. They will complement several other English teaching programs funded the U.S. Embassy and the U.S. Agency for International Development, the press release stated.
In 2016, the Government of Sri Lanka invited Peace Corps to return to work and assist in furthering the countrys development goals. A new bilateral agreement to re-establish the program was signed in February 2018.

Uva Wellassa University
Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. - Nelson Mandela
Uva Wellassa University, conceptualised with a vision to be the centre of excellence for value addition to the national resource base, was established in 2005 in Badulla, on the Passara road, in the salubrious surroundings of a panoramic location in the hills. The implementation of the universitys vision was led by a concrete mission to produce well-rounded, employable, technocratic and entrepreneurial graduates equipped with knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to make outstanding contributions to national development, and to excel in teaching, learning and research, with a strong emphasis on value addition to the national resources base.
The Vice Chancellor is the guiding light of any University. The founding Vice Chancellor of UWU, as it is known, is Dr. Chandra Embuldeniya. The university has been blessed with four distinguished personalities as Vice Chancellors - Dr. Chandra Embuldeniya, Professor Ranjith Premalal De Silva, Dr. G. Chandrasena, and Dr. J.L. Ratnasekara, who have guided the university towards its current status as an institution of repute, fulfilling its vision.
With a strong foundation, the UWU has begun its journey towards success in every step with the support of a young and enthusiastic team of academic staff, administrative staff and academic support staff who are committed to equipping students with better knowledge, skills and competencies. Not only that, they also widen their contribution by supporting students in every way to mould their young minds so that they become productive citizens.
Degree programmes
The University welcomes all perspectives, but above all, UWU salutes humanity, genuine service and quality. At a time when ragging in higher education institutions has been highlighted, the University entertained a learning environment free of controversy. The students enjoy their university entrance in the first two semesters learning and moulding their personalities by building soft skills with the Broad General Education (BGE) and Essential Skills Development (ESD) programmes.
Thirteen degree programmes conducted by four faculties have set their benchmark on outcome-based education, achieving their intended learning outcomes and measuring the standards of quality education at different levels.
The Management Faculty is committed to pursuing excellence in research, teaching, community services and universityindustry cooperation and collaboration, whilst making all efforts to be the centre of excellence for management and tourism education in Sri Lanka. The Management Faculty conducts two degree programmes: Entrepreneurship and Management and Hospitality, Tourism and Events Management.
Science and Technology, Computer Science and Technology, Industrial Information Technology and Mineral Resources Technology are the degree programmes offered by the Science and Technology Faculty. The faculty moulds UWU students with practical education, making them well equipped with research and leadership qualities.
Knowledge and expertise for value addition to the Sri Lankan resource base is well performed by the Animal Science and Export Agriculture Faculty, which offers five degree programmes - Animal Science, Aquatic Resources Technology, Export Agriculture, Tea Technology and Value Addition, and Palm and Latex Technology and Value Addition.
The Technological Studies Faculty which is the fourth faculty of the UUW was established in 2017 with the intention of uplifting the technological sector of the country. The Bachelor of Engineering Technology and Bachelor of Bio-Systems Technology are the two academic programmes which helps the faculty to reach its goal.
Learning method
There is a cultural shift in the field of higher education from that of a teaching university culture into a learning and reading university culture. After Independence, the country has been practising the teaching method more than the flexible learning method. Therefore, changing mindsets and re-structuring the cognitive map of students have become major challenges. the UWU symbolises the need for the structural change of the countrys education system, envisioning the multiple learning approach by changing the teaching method into learning models incorporating the existing hierarchical structure of knowledge, skills and attitudes into attitudes, knowledge and skills which give priority to the thinking aspect.
The conversion of human doing into human being is the key element of education which can only be done by developing the reading habit of the upcoming generation. Therefore, first place must be given to the library which is meant to be the heart of the university.
Reading can be more enthusiastic when it is inculcated in the culture: it should be well supported by the family, elementary schools, and public agents.

Villagers lament poaching at Huruluwewa
Huruluwewa villagers said that poachers had been killing wild animals using hakka patas at the Huruluwewa Forest Reserve, recently, villagers said.
Hakka patas is an explosive device which is a mixture of chemical compounds, together with lead and iron, which is usually inserted into a cucumber or pumpkin.
They said that as the tanks inside the forest reserve had run dry due to the prevailing drought, poachers had been able to kill wild animals seeking for water, effortlessly.
Villagers added that wild animal meat was being sold to traders in the Galenbindunuwewa area, whereas hakka patas is sold to poachers by the boutique owners in close proximity to the Huruluwewa Forest Reserve.
Certain villagers use firearms in order to protect themselves and their cultivations, and a number of them had been engaged in poaching activities, they added.
Villagers requested the relevant authorities to take measures to curb the poaching of wild animals.

Tom Cruise's Mission: Impossible  Fallout has been met with rave reviews from critics who say the franchise's latest installment may just been the best one yet.
Fallout - landing in theaters on July 27 - has been described as a 'stupefyingly awesome' 'save-the-world bonanza' that will 'put this summer's other action-adventure blockbusters to shame'.
While the premise itself - which follows IMF agent Ethan Hunt - is said to be lacking, reviewers have said the film is a must-see thanks to the non-stop action sequences Cruise is famous for.
The leading man, 56, is joined by a strong cast including Henry Cavill, Alec Baldwin, Vanessa Kirby, Angela Bassett and Simon Pegg.
The Mission: Impossible franchise has been churning out blockbusters since since the first installment came out in 1996 - and Fallout will be no exception, according to reviews.

All large-scale drug stores should register with the Health Ministry under the private pharmacies category, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne instructed.
Minister Senaratne said doctors often keep drug stocks for the use of their private dispensaries and such drug storage should be registered as pharmacies. It is illegal to store large stocks of drugs. The National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) will commence raids in this regard, he said.
The minister said private pharmacy owners complain about large stocks of drugs kept by doctors.
A decision was made to provide training for staffers attached to private pharmacies. A special programme is launched to train more pharmacists as there is a shortage in the country at present, the minister said.

Batman movie not based on Year One
Last year, Matt Reeves was hired to write and direct The Batman for Warner Bros., but the project hasnt shown much forward momentum in public. Recent rumors suggested that Reeves would start fresh with a new Batman, replacing Ben Affleck with a younger performer.
Its also been suggested that Reeves will base his script upon Batman: Year One, the classic story by Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli. However, Reeves directly refuted that rumor when he addressed the press at the Television Critics Association.
Via Slash Film, Reeves said Were not doing any particular [comic]Year One is one of the many comic books that I love. We are definitely not doing Year One. Its just exciting to be focused very specifically on a tale that is defining for him and very personal to him. Obviously were not doing an origin tale or anything like that. Were doing a story that is definitively Batman though and trying to tell a story thats emotional and yet is really about him being the worlds greatest detective and all the things that for me, since I was a kid, made me love Batman. Ive talked about making it a very point of view noir-driven definitive Batman story in which he is investigating a particular case and that takes us out into the world of Gotham, added Reeves.
I went on a deep dive again revisiting all my favorite comics. Those all inform by osmosis. Theres no continuation of the Nolan films. Its very much trying to find a way to do this as something that for me is going to be definitively Batman and new and cool. Reeves also indicated that his script for The Batman may have a first draft finished within a few weeks, which may allow the project to begin production early next year. Reeves declined to say definitively whether Affleck would remain involved or if the actor is planning to exit the DC Extended Universe. Coming Soon

Christina Aguilera has tipped her son to follow her into pop music after hearing him sing a track from her new album Liberation.
In a Twitter Q&A with fans the Genie In A Bottle hitmaker, 38, revealed she loves singing with her three-year-old daughter Summer Rain, but recently discovered her 10-year-old Max shares her vocal talent.
Summer and I stick to our Disney songs together, BUT, my son Max actually has an incredible voice- he doesnt showcase it a lot- but I caught him singing Maria (a track from the record) the other day, and he was pitch perfect, she wrote in response to a fan who asked her daughter knew any of her songs.
Tipping her son as a possible future star she added, He definitely has talent there if he ever wants to do anything with it.
Max is Christinas son by her first husband, marketing executive, Jordan Bratman. She is currently engaged to Summer Rains dad, Matthew Rutler.
When asked by another fan what the best thing about being a mother is, she replied: Being able to be a kid again myself, and finding pleasure in small smiles and cozy moments of everyday life.
Liberation is her first for six years, and when quizzed about her comeback record she hinted the long delay in releasing new material had been due to her unhappiness with the demands of pop stardom.

Revolutionary change in farming needed
The time is ripe to bring about a revolutionary change in the countrys agricultural policy, to make farming a profitable business, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The minister was speaking at the Sri Lanka Council for Agricultural Research Policy (SLCARP) symposium 2018, held yesterday in Colombo, under the theme Doubling the Farmers Income through Innovative Agriculture.
In the past, our policy primarily focused on National Food Security and achieving production targets without paying sufficient attention to the enhancement of the income and livelihoods of farmers, said the minister.
He said the agricultural policy, recently launched by the ministry, identified several strategies to empower farmers by establishing farmer producer organisations and to link the farmer to the market. The government is committed to increase the agriculture sectors share in the GDP, which will lead to increasing farmer incomes.
Our main focus is to increase agricultural productivity and profitability. An important item of our policy is to reduce imports of agricultural products, which can be produced by our farmers, giving them better prices while promoting exports for a high income. New market trends indicate a high demand for organic agricultural produce. Therefore, one way of increasing the farmers income, is to encourage chemical-free and environmentally-sustainable agricultural production. We need the participation of the private sector over the entire value chain to achieve success in our programme, said the minister.
He added that the government is aware of the impact of climate change on farming communities and has introduced an attractive insurance scheme covering five crops to help farmers cope with unfavourable weather conditions.
The government has also allocated a large amount of money to rehabilitate thousands of minor tanks, to stabilize farmer income and food production within the next couple of years, he said.
One of the biggest problems our farmers are facing today is the small size in land holdings which, in most cases, is less than a hectare.
Therefore, it is extremely difficult for a farmer to adopt mechanization, use modern technology and earn an adequate income only by farming. Hence, most of our farmers are part-time farmers or operate at subsistence levels. Therefore, the state policy has been to give subsidies and other assistance to sustain farming as a profession, the minister added.
SLCARP Chairman Dr. Gerry Jayawardena said over 70 percent of the 1.8 million farmer families in Sri Lanka earn a net income of less than Rs. 50,000 per month.
About 40 percent of them come under the three components of farming such as rice-based farming, highland for other vegetables, and fruit cultivations and homeland. Others come under the category of two components and single component farming, said the Chairman.
According to the Department of Agriculture statistics, the most profitable crops are potato, green chilies, big onion, pineapple, banana and papaya, where a farmer could obtain a net return of above Rs. 50,000 up to Rs. 80,000 and Rs. 100,000.
These farmers do not constitute over 10 percent of the farming population and a majority of the farming population gets a monthly income of less than Rs. 30,000.
Agriculture Deputy Minister Angajan Ramanathan, Ministry Secretary B. Wijeratne, Agriculture State Secretary V. Bandulasena, International Rice Research Institute and Agri-food Policy Platform Head Dr. Jean Balie, Agriculture Director General W.M.W. Weerakoon, SLCARP Secretary J.D.H. Wijewardena, Heads of Department, local and foreign agriculture scientists and others participated.

illegal posts in the PCs: Auditor General urged to halt expenditure
The JVP requested the Auditor General to act against spending public money on various posts in the Provincial Councils which are not legitimately recognised.
The JVP group in the Western Provincial Council yesterday made a written submission in this regard to Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe. JVP Councillor Lakshman Nipunaarachchi, speaking to the media after handing over the complaint, pointed out that the PC Act only recognises the posts of Chairman and Deputy Chairman and five ministerial portfolios.
He therefore argued that spending public money on posts such as Leader of the House, Chief Government Whip, Opposition Leader and Chief Opposition Whip is illegal and offensive.
He said that a large sum of public money is being spent on the staff, vehicles and office rooms of individuals holding the above mentioned illegal posts. The very aim of creating these posts is to have extra privileges. If the AG come forward and determine that the spending on those posts is illegal, then the PCs will have to stop them. A similar trend can be seen in the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) and the JVP group in CMC will make a complaint regarding that to the CMC Commissioner tomorrow, JVP Councillor Sunil Watagala said.
Councilor Nipunaarachhi further said that they would soon make another complaint to the AG asking him to hold a comprehensive audit inquiry on the construction of a new WPC building.
We have serious doubts that a large share of money out of the contract to construct this building has gone to the pockets of WPC rulers as in the case of importing chairs. We are awaiting the results of the Governors inquiry on importing chairs and will proceed to make a formal complaint to the AG asking for a comprehensive audit inquiry on the whole project, he told the media.

The military option
Railway commuters, no doubt, would have heaved a huge sigh of relief following the end to the strike called by the engine drivers, demanding that the government rectify their so called salary anomalies. The strike was called off following a meeting between President Maithripala Sirisena and leaders of the striking trade unions. It was reported that the President had promised the unions to find a solution to their grievances, which means revisiting the Cabinet paper over which a dispute arose between some ministers.
Trains began plying from Sunday evening with no signs of the state of anarchy that prevailed on Wednesday, when the engine drivers went on an unannounced strike over the alleged backtracking by Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera to implement the Cabinet paper. Commuters were left stranded and the entire Fort area was turned into a mass of chaos and pandemonium, with people running helter-skelter in confusion when even private buses shut their doors, unable, or, not willing to accommodate the stranded passengers who were permitted by the government to travel in alternative public transport with their railway season tickets.
The meagre SLTB buses that were available could not cope with the mass of humanity and the tri-shaw drivers, who, at other times, are only too eager to pick up fares, refused to do so, perhaps unwilling to get snarled up in the massive traffic jam. Needless to say, the buses deployed by the army was not equal to the task, all having the cumulative result of a large number of train passengers, who only had their train season tickets with them and no money, forced to spend the night in the city center, among them students sitting for their GCE(A/L) exams. The loss caused to the Railways by the three day strike was estimated at over Rs.70 million, ignoring other losses to the state such as fuel waste due to the massive traffic jams.
The striking unions were uncompromising that their salary anomalies be rectified before they resume duties while Minister Samaraweera was equally adamant that the strikers returned to work before any negotiations could be held. The President, it appears, had stepped into the breach to break the impasse which has now become an all too familiar scenario in the unity government.
It is not clear though if the railway unions decided to compromise on their stubborn refusal to return to work only after their demands were met, and meet the President instead, was due to a genuine concern for the commuters or it was occasioned by reports of the army being trained to take over train operations. According to media reports, the army had made a request from the Ministry of Defence that their men be trained as engine drivers and other aspects of train operations and the Ministry of Transport was due to take the matter up with the President and the Prime Minister. Deputy Minister of Transport Ashoka Abeysinghe stated that since periodic strikes by the railway trade unions were causing disruption to a host of government activities, not to mention the hardship caused to the travelling public, training soldiers to handle train operations would be given serious consideration.
This, no doubt, would have sent the jitters among the engine drivers whose take home pay is in the range of Rs. 175,000 to Rs. 230,000 per month. Any army takeover of their tasks, they know, would deny them such a windfall, and, what is more, could well be a permanent feature in the future, putting paid to their bargaining power to win demands. One recalls how the late President Premadasa dealt with the paralysis of the public transport during the 89/90 second JVP uprising. He resorted to the simple remedy of getting the army to remove all the private buses from the homes of their owners and operate them on their own. The owners had no option but to ply their buses, lest they be behind their lease installments and risk having the buses seized.
With reports of a private bus strike in the offing, the government should consider the option of bringing the army into the scene. We say this because the army had already demonstrated it was up to the task in handling any emergency, as was seen in the commendable job its men performed in clearance work in the wake of natural disasters and also victim rescue operations.
The government had been held to ransom by trade unions, backed by opposition political parties, for far too long. Besides, the public cannot be allowed to suffer hardship, as they did last Wednesday, to meet the demands of trade unions. The sooner the government decides on the army option the better it will be for its own health. We say this because, with major elections round the corner, strikes will be the norm, orchestrated by the pohottuwites to cause disaffection of the public towards the government.
The army being popular with the general public, its deployment would be only too welcome, and, what is more, make the government too popular for standing firm against the trade union mafia.

Akila bamboozled us says De Kock
South Africas acting captain Quinton de Kock under whose leadership his team suffered back to back defeats in the fourth and fifth ODIs against Sri Lanka admitted that they were bamboozled by the spin bowling of Akila Dananjaya.
South Africa suffered their third worst ODI defeat in history when they lost the fifth and final ODI at the R Premadasa Stadium on Sunday by 178 runs.
The main cause for their defeat was the devastating bowling of Dananjaya who went onto take a career best six wickets for 29 to bowl South Africa out for 121 chasing a target of 300.
Dananjaya bowled very well we have played him awhile in the series before but coming up to this game tonight it was very difficult to pick him initially in the night. Have to give it to him cant take that away from him, said De Kock at the post-match press conference.
De Kock was one of Dananjayas six victims getting bowled for 54 to a googly which he failed to pick.
We picked him really well during the whole series but tonight just goes to show what happened, he got his skills better, he just performed really well and he just bamboozled us. Credit to him till the next time we face him, said De Kock.
After winning the first three ODIs in a row South Africa faltered in the last two and De Kock gave credit to Sri Lanka for putting pressure on them.
The first two games especially we didnt have the biggest targets to chase, the last two games especially Sri Lankas batting line up had a lot of freedom they put a lot of pressure on us. They set us big challenging totals. We tried our best especially in the fourth ODI I thought we batted really well but unfortunately we couldnt finish it off and, tonight Dananjaya bowled really well.
For South Africa who had lost the two-Test series 2-0 it was all about winning in the subcontinent and their 3-2 win in the ODI brought them some sort of satisfaction. To come to Sri Lanka in the subcontinent especially its difficult to win a series as we saw in the Test matches. It was never easy for us. Coming to the ODIs and winning the series and to do it in the first 3 games pleases us; it pleases me and our team. To do it in the first two games was a big plus for us, it was never easy initially but we did it, said de Kock.
MAN OF STEEL
Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews said the two back to back wins was a good confidence booster but unfortunately it came a bit too late.
If we could have won one of the first three games it would have been a tremendous series. Nevertheless winning the last couple of games gives you that confidence and the brand of cricket that we want to play. I think we showcased that and todays performance was a clinical one by the team, said Mathews who played a leading role with the bat to top score with an unbeaten 97 an innings that formed the base of Sri Lankas total of 299-8.
Mathews described his match winning bowler Dananjaya as made out of steel for coming back the way he did after being hit for 81 runs in ten overs in the third ODI.
Akila has been bowling so well for us over the past year and a half. You can have a couple of off days but he has been consistent with his performances. He showed once again what hes capable of. Hes made out of steel. Going for runs in the last couple of games and coming back with a six-for in this game was fantastic, said Mathews.
As a team you want to keep developing and keep striving to be the best we can. We showed a glimpse of what we can do. We need to keep playing on good wickets because were not going to get dusty slow wickets when we go overseas. Were going to play on good solid wickets.
The batsmen have to score runs and the bowlers are always under pressure. The bowlers will also learn and the batsmen will learn how to score 300 consistently. That is something that were looking forward to. We need to limit our shortcomings in every game.
Our fielding wasnt that good. There was not a match in which we did all three disciplines well in the first three games. Either the batsmen failed, or the bowlers failed. Because of that we lost the first three matches. The positives are there. The way Akila Dananjaya, Dasun Shanaka, Thisara Perera, Dhananjaya de Silva and Kusal Perera played was good. For that Im happy, he said.

Authorities instructed to expedite work at Kalametiya harbour
Authorities were instructed to complete the construction work of the Kalametiya fisheries harbour within two months, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said.
He was addressing the fishing community at Tangalle, recently.
He said a tug o war between the company involved in the construction work and the consultancy firm had delayed the work. He said this would create a bad impression in the fishing community that the government is not focusing on completing it.
The State Minister added that the fishing community is facing many difficulties due to the delay and losing their income.
He said certain officials who bear different political views are attempting to hamper development activities to bring disrepute to the government. The State Minister added that the government has implemented development activities to cover all districts by changing the previous governments lopsided system of development which was restricted to a few districts.

Bizarre ruses and work-cut excuses!
Welcome to my world, the world of the printed word and also the unprintable ones at times. This is about life in the newsrooms both here and overseas. My column is dedicated to all those legendary hacks in the many newsrooms I have worked in disparate parts of the world.
I have encountered them all, including the conscientious ones who would faithfully come in to work even when running raging temperatures. On the other hand there are those who cry off work at the drop of a mild sneeze. Whether its just plain laziness, a hangover, or a sense of entitlement, many journalists conjure up a flurry of implausible excuses to take a day off.
The line between work and home time is blurred for most journalists. That is because newspaper shifts are by no means usual. Many in the fraternity who work graveyard shifts start working when normal civilized people are about to go to bed and head for home when others are waking up. Some of these night owls and dawn twilight workers are masters of the art and can spin a plausible yarn that would bring tears to the eyes of the most hard-bitten cynical editors. That is because in the sorority of wordsmiths, as in any profession, there are liars, damned liars and experts. That got me thinking as to define who actually is an expert
Calling in to tell your editor or desk head that you cannot come into work for the day can be a touchy issue. If you are planning to take a day off, in most instances you will need a darn good excuse for missing work or risk causing problematic issues, or perhaps some tension at the job for your colleagues.
Here is a great falsification that works every time, if you have false teeth that is. It was used consistently by an old sub-editor nicknamed Paul Pachaya who got away with it at least a half dozen times. His stock excuse: I dropped and broke my dentures. And then there was old Pottay Peter whose bad eyesight constrained him to wear thick bottle-lens glasses. His run of the mill explanation was: I have misplaced my glasses and cant find them until I find them!
And who can forget Dead-Bull Douglas a photographer who claimed he had cut his foot every time he had to cover a wedding in his private capacity. The rascal returned to the office late or on the following day with an exaggerated limp. To make the excuse stick he put a pebble in his shoe that reminded him to walk gingerly because of the stitches. It worked like a charm until a hawk-eyed news editor caught him both literally and figuratively on the wrong foot. In the course of the day he had transferred the pebble to his other shoe.
Journalistic executives are usually liberal and understanding with leave unlike those in different professions who are more stringent and do not want employees taking off unless the situation truly warrants a leave of absence. This issue is one of the oldest conflicts in business and has been a problem since the first days of capitalism. The experts usually decide on a reasonable illness, such as a migraine headache or food poisoning.
The liars and damned liars come up with what the bosses call the mother of all excuses such as someone in your family dying. A death in the family excuse, if a damnable lie, is questionable for moral reasons. If it is true, then it is not an excuse, it is a reason someone would not show up for work. When you lie about having a death in the family, it can actually come back to bite you if you are not prepared to show proof of the death.
One proofreader in Hong Kong is reputed to have attended his mothers funeral at least six or seven times. It is true that the family matriarch had actually died. But the sad event had occurred some fifteen years before his prolonged period of mourning. Most accommodating editors are liberal with hangover excuses, because they too have suffered the ravages of the morning after at some time or another.
The trick is not to get caught up in a lie. The truth, sometimes with a bit of liberally-laced humour works better. In my long and varied career as a managing editor and editor-in-chief I have come across some of the most bizarre excuses imaginable. For instance a womens page sub-editor once called and explained to me: I am not coming in because I tried to dye my hair black, but it came out green! The only thing missing is my mode of transportation, a broomstick. Naturally I excused the witty witch.
Another hard-working feature writer who had not been spared the amorous arrows of Cupids compulsively mischievous bowstring and had been drinking heavily to drown his disappointment called in to say that he was indisposed. Aware of his one-sided infatuation I asked what his sickness entailed. He said without preamble: Liver function is normal. But the lab test indicated abnormal lover function.
A junior reporter once called in and offered this excuse: I am very close to the office but a car drove by and splashed an entire puddle over me. The news editor told her if she was close to the office to come in anyway. She did and she entered the office with her clothes spattered with mud.
The disbelieving news editor offered her office transport to go home shower and change.
A broadminded, sympathetic editor who indulgently granted a lying rapscallion journalist a weeks leave to attend his fathers funeral realised later he had been taken for a ride. When the deceitful reporter returned after completing his sympathy leave he was confronted by his usually tolerant boss. The editor shook his hand, sympathized and asked: Do you believe in life after death The liar responded without batting an eyelash: Yes chief, I certainly do!
Eyes blazing the editor fired back: I thought you would. That is because never since the miracle of Lazarus did the spectacle of a dead man arising from the grave inspire such spontaneously robust faith among your colleagues.
The fraud completely flummoxed retorted: But, but Chief what are you talking about The editor shot him a withering look and fired: After you left to attend your fathers funeral, he stopped by the office to see you.

California fire threatens retirement community
US: One of the fires scorching California Sunday moved in on a retirement community, prompting evacuation orders for thousands of people.
Residents of the Trilogy Glen Ivy community located between the Santa Ana Mountains and a major highway who have trouble driving in the dark were urged to leave immediately to escape the wrath of the Holy Fire, which has already burned through 22,714 acres (9,192 hectares) and is 41 percent contained.
The US Forest Service estimates that around 3,700 homes and structures have been evacuated, or around 11,120 people.
Nearly 1,500 firefighters -- supported by some inmates from a local jail -- are battling that blaze, as it spread to the north and east, prompting a new round of evacuations.
Across California, firefighters reported making significant progress against some of the huge wildfires raging across the most populous state, but were bracing for more of the soaring temperatures, dry air and gusty winds that have made their job so tough.
Some of the worst fires slowed over the weekend.
The so-called Mendocino Complex north of state capital Sacramento -- including the River and Ranch fires, which together form the largest blaze in state history -- burned 3,100 acres overnight, just one fourth the previous nights toll, according to local media.
The Carr fire in the north, which has destroyed more than 1,000 homes, grew only modestly overnight, as containment lines improved.
Their task was complicated by steep terrain making it difficult for fire trucks to approach. More than 25 aircraft were being used to drop water and fire-retardant chemicals.
Some 18 blazes are continuing to scorch wide swathes of California.
The Ranch fire, part of the Mendocino Complex, was 58 percent contained as of Saturday, while the River Fire was 92 percent contained, news media reported. The two blazes have devastated an area of more than 325,000 acres so far.
Authorities have charged a 51-year-old man, Forrest Gordon Clark, with multiple arson-related charges in connection with the Holy Fire.
A court set bail at $1 million for Clark, who has had repeated encounters with local police over the years.
Clark could face anywhere from 10 years to life in prison if convicted. He rejected the charges during an erratic court appearance, calling them a lie.
He said he could easily afford bail and asked if he could pay it right away.- AFP

CEA to step up polythene raids
The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) will step up its raids on banned polythene items with the support of the Police Environment Unit and Consumer Affairs Authority.
A blanket ban on shopping bags, lunch sheets and rigifoam lunch boxes was imposed in the country from January.
The CEA raided a large-scale lunch sheet manufacturing company in Meerigama in the Gampaha district last Saturday. Food wrappings valued at about Rs. 1 million were taken into custody and the manufacturing had been carried out using banned material without permits.
The CEA Director General said discussions were ongoing to obtain Police support in CEA raids on banned polythene items as these items affect the manufacturers and sellers of bio-degradable lunch sheet producers.
The manufacturers of biodegradable and compostable lunch sheets complain that they were unable to sell their products due to the abundance of banned lunch sheets in the market.
All Ceylon Polythene Manufacturers and Recyclers Association Vice President Vijitha Warnakulasuriya warned that they would withdraw from importing and manufacturing bio-degradable lunch sheets as banned lunch sheets continue to invade the market.
The Gazettes Extraordinary prohibits manufacture, sale, offer for sale, offer free of charge, exhibition or use of polythene or any polythene product that are 20 microns and below, lunch sheets, grocery bags, food containers (lunch boxes), plates, cups, and spoons from expanded polystyrene.
The use of all forms of polythene for decorative purposes at political, social, religious, national, cultural or any other event or occasion is also prohibited; including open burning of refuse and other combustible matters inclusive of plastics.

## Supertitle:

Chasing illusions futile
Encarta Dictionary defines an illusion as a false idea, deception or belief about somebody or something. Often the result of chasing illusions is negative. Or the desired result cannot be achieved. By the time it is realized much damage has been done. Take for instance various pyramid schemes which promise huge dividends. This is true of individuals, as well as of groups or communities. Illusion leads to despair. This may also result in chasing a different illusion.
Today people are looking for an alternative. Some are looking for a Messiah or a Prince Diyasena in the local literary parlance. Some among them even wish for a dictator or a Hitler or Prabhakaran to deliver the goods. They do not have to look far. There are already vendors in the political market selling elixirs for all popular ills just like the ubiquitous medicinal oil sellers who draw audiences at every bus stop, temple celebration, weekend fair etc.
Already several personalities have indicated their desire to contest the next Presidential election since the present Parliament seems to lack a majority that could approve a Constitutional amendment to abolish the executive presidency.
Ego-building exercises
Among them are the Rajapaksa brothers Gotabhaya, Basil and Chamal representing the former regime. The Prime Minister and the President are also in the contest. Several Cabinet Ministers have also signalled their intention to contest as evidenced from their ego-building exercises.
You cannot exclude proxy candidates that would be sponsored by powerful persons as well as candidates from outside the UNP, SLFP, and SLPP triad. There could also be attempts to repeat the 2015 scenario of a surprise common candidate. The door is still wide open.
This chasing after personalities is an illusion based on a false premise that the failures of the present and the past are due to personalities. No. However much they are maligned the failures so far, during the last 70 years is due to the nature of the economic and political set up or the system that exists to date. Personalities could only improve or worsen the situation marginally.
Neither the colonial economy which ensured the extraction of our surplus production by the imperial metropolis and perpetuated our economic and political dependence nor the post-1956 reforms could effect a radical change in the divide between the haves and the have-nots. The rich became richer and the poor became poorer and the gap between them widened with each passing regime despite the achievements and weaknesses of the leaders. The situation became worse after the introduction of the open economy and the neo-liberal economic reforms. The latter has been the credo of all governments since 1977.
Politics is said to be a concentrated form of economics. Political regimes barring those born by revolutions, of necessity follow the dominant economic relations.
Therefore, as long as the fundamental economic development policy remains neo-liberal and hence subservient to global monopoly capital by whatever nomenclature it is introduced the present disparities and shortcomings would continue and wealth and poverty would polarize at the two extremes. There is also another illusion that is widespread. That is it is the incumbent government that is the cause of all ills. The incumbent government is faithfully continuing the same old economic strategy of the former regime or regimes. Hence it alone cannot be blamed. Neither is it correct to blame the former regime alone. When it is a case of birds of the same feather how could you distinguish them Take, for instance, Sri Lankas debt burden. Who is responsible The fault is not in getting loans from foreign or local sources but in how you utilize the loans and how you pay back. Using loans, especially foreign loans for unproductive consumption or wasting them on extravagant exhibition expenditure is a crime.
The same is with the cost of living. We have witnessed ample instances of the pot calling the kettle black. It is time to see both of them black as they exist.
Our education system is in a crisis. This did not originate with the Yahapalana government.
It is there since we abandoned the Kannangara education reforms halfway and began various amateur experiments, often under World Bank tutelage.
Seventy years after independence we cannot guarantee a school with all the necessary facilities to each newborn. Pre-school education is abandoned to the mercy of mercenary elements and incompetent tutors.
Lies, damn lies and statistics
We wonder at our development. We are excited about highways, macadamized wide roads, luxury vehicles on the road and high-rises in Colombo.
We do not see the poverty and under-development behind the faade of development. We are bombarded with official statistics of GDP growth etc. but often statistics are third category lies a la Mark Twain who said that there are three types of lies- lies, damn lies and statistics.
Or else consider corruption. Did it start with the Central Bank Bond scam What about the Vat scam, the SriLankan airline frauds, violation of tender and procurement procedures throughout several regimes, the favouritism in appointments to public offices
These are all endemic in the system. It is the system that should go. We need new policies, policies that are people-friendly or pro-poor, policies that would guarantee an independent economic development within the global division of labour.
No authoritarian regime could guarantee such policies for they require a much wider democracy, much wider participation of people in governance.
It requires the empowerment of the people- of workers, peasants, middle and small entrepreneurs etc. It requires the defence and protection of local industrial, agrarian and commercial interests vis-a-vis their foreign counterparts.
This does not preclude productive cooperation with global capital, especially South-South cooperation.
It is time to stop the futile search for heroes or messiahs. It is time for the civil society to come forward and charter an independent path of development.
It is time that the best brains and hearts of the nation be put together to charter such a course. In such an alternative course lies our future well-being.

Wildlife Minister Field Marshal SarathFonseka has said that the police would not be able to eradicate the underworld by resorting to third grade and futile methods.
He has said some police officers in his electorate reportedly assault innocent people, file court cases against innocent people after planting drug packets and also demand ransom.
This is a very serious complaint. Sarath Fonseka is an expert on these matters.
He had been in charge of the Army for several years.
His performance had been excellent. He is a senior Minister. He has every right to talk about law and order. He is an authority on these matters. We thank Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka for having the courage to point out lapses.
This type of harassment can happen to anyone.
This is supposed to be Yahapalanaya period.
We expect police to handle the underworld problem in a more professional manner.
We salute SarathFonseka for talking against injustice.
We hope other politicians also talk against injustice, corruption, mismanagement, wastage, inefficiency, frauds, negligence, indiscipline, misuse and other weaknesses in our society.

Dananjaya reaches career-best 21st position in ODI rankings

Apart from this the actress even desires to try her hands in the field of direction. During an interaction with a tabloid, the actress revealed that a few years from now she will definitely turn a director. Aishwarya added that even Abhishek Bachchan has encouraged her to explore the field.
Speaking about how she will be a hands-on director, Aishwarya said that whenever she directs, she will throw herself whole-heartedly in it. She added that it will never be a fly-by-night commitment for her as her work consumes her completely.
After 'Fanney Khan', Aishwarya will be seen in Anurag Kashyap's 'Gulab Jamun' along with husband Abhishek Bachchan next. TNN

Lady Gaga has paid tribute to her Born This Way video co-star Rick Genest in an emotional series of tweets following his death on August 1.
The heavily-tattooed model and artist, also known as Zombie Boy, was found dead in his apartment in Montreal, Canada from an apparent suicide at the age of 32 last Wednesday.
On Thursday night, Lady Gaga, who recruited Genest for the video to her 2011 song, paid tribute to her co-star on Twitter by sharing a series of pictures and called on those suffering with mental health issues to reach out to somebody.
The suicide of friend Rick Genest, Zombie Boy is beyond devastating, she wrote. We have to work harder to change the culture, bring Mental Health to the forefront and erase the stigma that we cant talk about it. If you are suffering, call a friend or family today. We must save each other.
Science tells us that it takes 21 days to form a habit, if you are suffering from Mental Health issue I beckon for today to be your first day or a continuation of the work youve been doing. Reach out if youre in pain, and if you know someone who is, reach out to them too.
The 32-year-old also encouraged her followers to sign up to her charity, the Born This Way Foundation, before the autumn, when she will explore the power of habits to build cultures of kindness and wellness.

Female Welikada prisoners protest
Around 25 female inmates of the Welikada Prison had got onto the prison roof and staged a protest yesterday morning against a decision taken by the prison authorities to limit the food items allowed to be brought from outside and demanding that their cases be taken up for hearing early.
However, the prison authorities said that bringing food inside the prison was limited from last week as they had found that drugs were being smuggled into prison concealed in the food items.
The female prison inmates had been behaving in a disrorderly manner last morning in protest against the limiting of food allowed to be brought from outside and had subsequently got onto the roof of the prison building and staged a protest.
It is also reported that the majority of female inmates engaged in the protest are those serving prison terms relating to drug cases.
Meanwhile, Justice and Prison Reforms Minister Thalatha Athukorale had told the media during a ceremony in Nivithigala yesterday that regardless of the prisoners protests, cases cannot be expedited and they must follow the regular procedure.
The Minister had noted that despite being imprisoned, illegal activities were still taking place within the prisons and she would not hesitate to take all possible measures to put an end to such illegal activities.
Two prison inmates who were protesting on the roof of Welikada prison were admitted to hospital following a clash between two groups of woman inmates.
The injured were admitted to prison hospital yesterday evening.
Prison sources said that the protest was continuing yesterday evening too.
Meanwhile, an organisation for the protection of prisoners rights held a protest opposite the prison premises demanding that the government ensure more facilities for the prisoners.
They said that over 1,500 inmates are housed in a ward which has the capacity to accommodate only 200 inmates.

Fitch affirms Abans Finance at BB+(lka); Outlook Stable
Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed Abans Finance PLCs National Long-Term Rating at BB+(lka). The Outlook is Stable.
The affirmation reflects Fitchs view that support would be forthcoming from parent, Abans PLC (BBB+(lka)/Stable), based on Abans majority 49.7% equity stake, involvement in Abans Finances strategic direction through board representation, a common brand name and demonstrated support through past equity injections.
Abans Finance is rated three notches below its parent because of its limited contribution to the groups core businesses.
The company financed less than 1% of Abans consumer durables revenue in the financial year ending March 2018 (FY18). It mainly provides vehicle financing, with 47% of its lending channelled through the sales of two-wheelers by Abans Auto (Pvt) Limited, a company owned by Abans shareholders but positioned outside of the Abans group.
Abans Finance also only contributed 5% of group revenue and 9% of group operating profit in FY18.
Abans Finances standalone rating is weaker than its support-driven rating due to weak asset quality - a reflection of the companys high-risk appetite with significant asset concentration in two-wheeler financing that is more vulnerable to the economic cycle. Fitch expects persistent asset-quality pressure, stemming from a challenging operating environment.
The companys asset-quality metrics were weaker than those of similarly rated peers, with a reported regulatory gross non-performing loan ratio of 10.9% at FYE18, significantly above the 5.8% industry average.

Fitch Revises Bimputh Finances Outlook to Negative
Fitch Ratings Lanka has revised the Outlook on the National Long-Term Rating of Bimputh Finance PLC (Bimputh) to Negative from Stable. At the same time, the agency has affirmed the National Long-Term Rating at BB(lka).
The Outlook revision reflects the finance companys high capital-impairment risk arising from declining pre-impairment operating profit buffers amid a weakening in asset quality, reducing its capacity to absorb credit-cost shocks.
The revision also captures potential pressure on Bimpuths financial profile from increasing exposure to the non-microfinance business as the company is still developing risk controls in this segment.
Bimpuths rating reflects its high-risk appetite stemming from its substantial exposure to microfinance, which accounted for 50% of total lending at end-June 2018. The higher-yielding microfinance segment tends to be more vulnerable to economic changes. Fitch expects microfinance to remain a dominant product for Bimputh although lending to this segment has declined.
The rating also captures the companys heavy reliance on borrowings and potential capitalisation drag from weakening credit quality and strong loan growth aspirations.
Bimpuths asset quality is likely to continue to be pressured by Sri Lankas challenging operating environment. The companys reported non-performing loan (reported on a six-months-in-arrears basis) ratio rose to 6.4% by end-March 2018 from 3.0% a year earlier. This was despite a 5.7% net charge-off of average gross loans for the financial year ended March 2018 (FY18).
We expect Bimpuths medium-term profitability to remain weak, weighed down by high credit and operating cost burdens and a lower share of high-yielding microfinance. The companys pretax profit to average assets declined to 3.0% in FY18 from 9.7% in FY17.
Bimpuths weak deposit franchise means it remains reliant on wholesale borrowings. The companys deposit base is highly concentrated and stayed small at 26.9% of total funding at end-March 2018.
Bimputh is a small finance company accounting for 0.7% of licensed finance-company and specialised leasing-company sector assets at end-March 2018 (March 2017: 0.9%).
Weakening in its capitalisation metrics due to aggressive loan growth and deterioration in credit quality may trigger a negative rating action. An upgrade is contingent on a sustained improvement in credit metrics - in particular capitalisation - and a moderation of its risk appetite.

Generosity, wrong placed
One of the more notable lay activities during the main Poya days is the Dansala. Generally conducted in urban settings, soup kitchens of sorts, these are open houses where those passing by are assured of some victuals, even a proper meal in some places.
The intention, on the face of it, is noble. In any society, there are the prosperous and there are the poor; what can be more meritorious than the former donating some food to the needy, if not consistently, at least on a special day. In every religion, giving has a special place. It has been especially extolled in Buddhism, not only the giving of your money and material; but of your time, prospects and bodily organs - even of self, if required. Although many of them rank among the poorer nations, countries with Buddhist majorities like Myanmar, Sri Lanka Thailand score high in the giving index.
In these convoluted times it can happen that giving can become a mindless exercise, with little appreciation of the philosophy behind it, something done for effect; launched with fanfare, conducted with an unseemly loudness, driven by other motivations. And if an activity with a religious element is carried on for long enough, time will surely sanctify it.
Meritorious deeds
Down the Colombo Street where I live there are three Dansalas held or have been held, unfailingly for three years now. The first is sponsored by a well-heeled doctor with a lucrative general practice in the suburbs. Having prospered, he moved into the city a few years ago, building a fortress-like house on the newly purchased land. He is a successful doctor, apparently in the suburb where he practices referred to with awe as one-shot'. I am not very certain why this sobriquet is used on him, perhaps his prescriptions result in immediate relief to the curable, while the incurable is dispatched forthwith.
You would have thought that his professional exertions alone would be good enough; ending of pain, curing the sick being very high in the hierarchy of meritorious deeds. But the good doctor wants to do more, there is the sick and there is also the hungry; the idea of a dansala, when hundreds line up in front of his house for the food, their thankful blessings permeating the air, is irresistible. The act of curing is private, between the doctor and the patient inside a consulting room. But a dansala is a public act of charity, the gratitude of the masses is palpable.
His dansala gives ice cream, from the aspect of organising, perhaps an easier option. It takes only minimal effort to arrange for the ice cream and the cone in which it is served. The launching of the dansala is announced, like most public functions in this country, with the lighting of loud crackers, sustained for about five minutes. It takes a little longer for the dogs, panicked by the noise to stop their howling. Attracted by the free ice cream, passing vehicles of all descriptions; massive four-wheel drives, three-wheelers, motorcycles stop haphazardly, blocking driveways and even the road. Some walk away with several ice cream cones in their hands, for those at home, they explain, needlessly.
The doctor has arranged for a lot of ice cream, the dansala goes on for a good three hours. There are several assistants helping out; merit is generously shared. It is not only the financier who stands to benefit in the afterlife.
Now in our more enlightened times, sugar is considered a great enemy of good health as much as alcohol and tobacco. A doctor who smokes may be like an overweight physical trainer, a contradiction of his calling. How about the medical profession promoting sugary foods
The second dansala is sponsored by the prominent tavern in the area. It is commonly said that powerful political figures are behind it, a belief supported by the indifference of the regulators to a hooch business emerging suddenly in a residential area with several religious and educational institutions within touching distance. Go in any time to the bar and you will see men bombed out with booze, slumped on their seats inelegantly.
Once a year the tavern hosts a dansala, bread and Seeni Sambol doled out to those passing by. This dansala is launched with a religious ceremony, including priests. While the food lasts there is loud music for the diners. Next morning the Abans cleaners confront a road overwhelmed with plastic bags, pieces of bread and empty water bottles.
Collecting funds
There are no rich sponsors for the third dansala which is hosted by the nearby three wheel stand. Young three-wheel drivers go around beforehand with a list, giving the fund collecting exercise a certain accounting legitimacy. In addition to the merit earned, the donors are also invited to partake of the fried rice. Those who give large donations need not stand in line.
A few weeks back, I was at a home for the elderly where a meal for the inmates was sponsored. Nearly all inmates were afflicted with some form of health issue, given their age, only to be expected. The home was basic; there were no provisions for special care, which some of the inmates clearly needed. On inquiring, we were shown an unprepossessing middle-aged man as the person in charge of administering medicine, which had to be provided by the family of the inmates.
It was obvious that only a perfunctory attempt was made to keep the place clean, I suspect the home was hastily cleaned that morning in anticipation of our visit.
Yet the smell of rotting cabbage and mildew that clung to the place could not be removed. I peeped into the kitchen, a sight of unwashed utensils and plates. There was a large cat lying on a table.
The meal we served was partaken with obvious appreciation. You could tell that the richer offerings, the pastas, the puddings, were familiar to some of the inmates who, despite themselves relished the fare.
Perhaps they were reminded of happier days when such foods were a regular part of their lives.
Talking to the inmates was revealing of lives once full of hope and expectations. The tedium of their present existence can only be explained in terms of lifes uncertainties. In their productive years, it would have been unimaginable that their last years would be spent in such a place.
Typical of their life stories is that of the former bank manager. His career began as a clerk at a government bank. The man worked hard, sat his banking exams and eventually ended up as a branch manager. He obtained a loan on concessionary terms with which he built a house on a land owned by his wife. On completion, the house was gifted to the daughter, their only child. After the passing of his wife, the daughter had looked after him. Eventually, the daughter got married to a Sri Lankan domiciled in Australia and the house was considered her dowry.
Her husband wanted to buy a house in Australia and in order to meet him she sold the property and took the money with her. The retired banker moved to a rented house. He still had some savings with him.
Some years later the daughters marriage broke up. She had two children by then and needed money urgently. The father dipped into his savings and was eventually compelled to move into this home.
His daughter has put in the papers for him to join her in Australia and he is hopeful of joining her soon. That day for him will be a joyful escape from the surrounding air of defeat, dejection and hopelessness.
It is sad that there are no permanent dansalas in these homes. There should be, not only providing those stranded there with good meals, but also bringing some hope and happiness again to their dreary lives.

GSMP airborne survey on radioactive mineral resources
The Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GS&MB) will be conducting an airborne survey on the radioactive mineral resources in Sri Lanka in mid 2019, the GS&MB Senior Director (Geology) Udaya De Silva said yesterday.
Responding to the Daily News, De Silva said that the objective of the survey is to identify the radioactive mineral resources which are economically effective to the country. He pointed out that an island wide survey on the subject has not been done since the 1950s.
GS&MB, with the assistance of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Board (SLAEB) has been continuously conducting surveys to identify radioactive mineral resources island wide, he said.
One of the main surveys we did in 2010 focused on the areas from Nayaru to Batticaloa. We have recognized 09 areas where there are radioactive minerals in this landscape. We are conducting further investigations on these areas at present. This year we started doing a survey from Mannar to Colombo extending to Kirinda. Our main focus is on Uranium and Thorium availability in these areas and the surveys mainly focus on Sri Lankan beaches. De Silva explained. The Senior Director also said that the IAEA donated a Carbon Gamma-ray Spectrometer to Sri Lanka, which has immensely contributed to the survey activities of GSMB.
De Silva also said that three areas in Matale have also been identified to contain radioactive mineral resources. He pointed out that detailed studies are being conducted at present focusing on these identified areas.
De Silva also said that the airborne radio metric survey will be conducted with the help of helicopters and planes. The airborne survey will allow us to collect data available across the country in a short period of time and then we will be able to conduct individual surveys focusing on those identified areas.

Halep wins Montreal crown
MONTREAL, Sunday - World number one Simona Halep held her nerve in a rollercoaster duel with Sloane Stephens on Sunday to win the WTA Montreal crown for the second time.
In a gruelling 2hr 41min battle, French Open champion Halep prevailed 7-6 (8/6), 3-6, 6-4 over Stephens in a repeat of the duo's meeting in the final of Roland Garros earlier this year.
The victory was Halep's 18th career title and her second in Montreal following her success in 2016.
The 26-year-old sealed the win with an ace on her fourth match point, capping an enthralling duel marked by several momentum swings.
Halep had taken the first set on a tie-break, after saving four set points against American third seed Stephens.
Halep made the stronger start, dictating rallies from the baseline to race into a 4-1 lead after twice breaking Stephens in the opening five games.
Yet reigning US Open champion Stephens rallied superbly to claw her way back into the contest, breaking twice to level at 4-4.
That however proved to be the cue for Halep to respond, breaking back after a net cord sat up invitingly for the Romanian, who crushed a winner into the corner for 5-4.
Another poor service game from Halep though gave the initiative back to Stephens, who broke for 5-5 and then held for a 6-5 lead. AFP
