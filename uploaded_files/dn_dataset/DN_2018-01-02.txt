Motor industry yet to see Budget tax impact
The effects of the tax changes announced in Budget 2018 on November 9, 2017 for the motor industry are yet to take effect, said J. B. Securities in their monthly review of the industry.
It says that the registrations in November were lackluster except for a pickup in small hybrid cars. Motor cars segment recorded 2,439 units in November up from 1,961 units in October but significantly down from 3,574 units 12 months ago.
In the brand-new segment volumes slumped to a 24-month low of 473 units in November down from 582 units in Oct and 2,098 units 12 months ago. Pre-owned cars recorded 1,966 units significantly up from 1,966 units in Oct and 1,476 units 12 months ago. The exceptional growth came from Suzuki Wagon R which has a 658cc hybrid engine thus under the unit method attracts a lower level of duty.
Premium motor cars recorded 82 units of which 55 were new and 27 preowned, it was lower at 62 units in Oct and 73 units 12 months ago. In the brand new segment MB recorded 27 units in the preowned segment MB accounted for 10 units.In the SUV segment 600 units were registered up from 407 units in Oct and 477 units 12 months ago.
Hybrid registrations were 2,049 units up from 1,405 units in Oct and 1,605 units 12 months ago. Motor cars accounted for 1,707 units, SUVs 322 units followed by vans accounting for only 1 unit. Of the total 1,025 units have engines of size 650cc, 909 units have engines between 1L and 1.5L and only 99 units have engines larger than 1.5L. Electric car registrations have slumped to 5 units slightly up from 3 units in Oct and down from 24 units 12 months ago. Twenty four months ago the figure was 242 units.
Van registrations recorded 569 units slightly down from 589 units in Octonber and significantly up from a mere 100 units 12 months ago. Volumes are being driven by micro vans with 650cc engines that account for 380 units.
3-wheeler registrations were 2,265 units slightly up from 2,155 units and significantly down from 6,098 units 12 months ago. As a point of reference 2 years ago the figure was 10,494 units.
The main reason for the slump is the 25% LTV ceiling imposed by the Central Bank on lenders holding back credit extension.
The 2-wheeler registrations were 28,272 units slightly down from 28,786 units in October and down from 32,082 units 12 months ago. Scooters accounted for 15,241 units.
Pickup trucks recorded 164 units up from 138 units in Oct and significantly down from 529 units 12 months ago.

Tiger Zinda Hai
Tiger Zinda Hai, a film about two spies  one Indian and the other Pakistani  is largely a story about humanity, says its director Ali Abbas Zafar.
Even at the best of times, tackling a movie with Indian and Pakistani protagonists can be tricky. How did he handle it
[The film] is not political at all. The idea is that when there is a fight between right and wrong, what is at stake is humanity. And theres nothing bigger than humanity, Zafar said over phone from Mumbai.
Given the current times, theres a question mark on the creative freedom of filmmakers in India, especially when it comes to sensitive topics.
Its a double-edged sword, he said. As a filmmaker and a creative person, I need to be sensitive to what is happening around me. I always personally think that no matter what happens, everything can be solved through dialogue. We should not take ourselves too seriously. At the end of it, it is a film... We work because of our conviction... at the same time it should not offend anyone.
Tiger Zinda Hai is the sequel to the 2012 action film Ek Tha Tiger, which was directed by Kabir Khan. The film featured superstar Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif as Indian and Pakistani agents, and the two stars are back on screen after five years in the same roles. It was extensively shot in Abu Dhabi.
Working on the sequel, produced by Yash Raj Films, has been challenging for Zafar.
But we are hopeful that the second part is going to live up to expectations. The story is the most important aspect of the film. Of course, Salman and Katrina are there. Both of them came on board after hearing the story, and they said that irrespective of whether it was a sequel or not, we had to do the film, he said.
Both of them are so comfortable with each other off-screen that as soon as a little bit padding from a scene or song happens, their chemistry blooms on camera.
I think that is an asset for a director because I dont need to push for it too much.

Tiger Zinda Hai is screening at Majestic Cineplex. It is subtitled in English. It is a CEL release

2018 could be a good year for Kandy sports
2018 is going to be a good year for sports in Kandy. Sportsmen and women over here are taking stock of their lives and mapping out how to improve themselves in 2018 in the sports to stay fit and healthy. Most people wake up on January 1st with the best intentions. 2017 was good for rugby especially at club level where the only rugby playing club Kandy Sports Club steps into the New Year with an unbeaten record. Cricket, swimming, athletics, chess and hockey at school level were also at its best.
The obvious and most stated reason why playing sports helps you in life is because of leadership and teamwork. The reason why playing sports early in life helps children become successful is because it teaches them how to live a healthy lifestyle. Although there are obvious exceptions, good health correlates strongly with success in jobs. Reasons for this are because if you are in good shape, you feel good about yourself, and confidence is crucial. Those who are confident in themselves perform much great than those who are not. It is proven that physical exercise puts people in better moods, and allows them to keep fit. Getting a good amount of fitness and being in a good mood will help you in your workplace. Playing sports as a child puts them on the right track.
All schools are in top form to present good cricket, the last two months matches were held up due to bad weather. This year the Trinity-St. Anthonys big match known as the Battle of the Maroons will be the 101st encounter, Dharmaraja vs Kingswood encounter will be the 112th called the Battle of the Maroons, The Battle of the Babes between St. Sylvesters and Vidyartha will be the 60th. Wariyapola Sri Sumangala and Sri Rahula will clash for the 20th time known as the Battle of the Golds, Madina Central Madawella and Al Azhar Akurana known as the Battle of the Double Maroons is the only big match in the country between two Muslim schools.
Then there is the 74th Bradby, the first leg it is reliably learnt will be on April 21st and the 2nd leg on May 5.
All rugby playing schools are in top form and are blessed with good players and coaches and determined to come out with fine performances.

AirAsia sets up subsidiary in China
Air Asia is a step closer to setting up a joint-venture low-cost airline operation in China, having received a business licence approval on Nov 13 from the local government (via unit AirAsia Investment Ltd) and incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary.
In a filing with Bursa Malaysia AirAsia said the new subsidiary, AirAsia (Guangzhou) Aviation Service Ltd Company, was expected to have issued share capital of US$1mil.
The main objective of establishing the subsidiary is to have an aviation and commercial services company in China. The incorporation of the subsidiary is not expected to have any immediate effect on the issued and paid-up share capital or substantial shareholders shareholding in AirAsia, it said.
AirAsia inked a non-binding term sheet with Everbright Financial Investment Holdings, Plato Capital Ltd and Oxley Capital Ltd to supplement a memorandum of understanding (MoU) dated May 14 between it, Everbright and Henan Government Working Group for purposes of setting up a JV in China to operate a low-cost aviation business.
China-based Everbright is a conglomerate focusing mainly on financial services.
Plato, listed on the Singapore Exchange, is involved in hospitality, education and precision engineering sectors while Oxley is part of the Oxley Group, a Singapore-headquartered private investment firm.
According to the announcement on the MoU, the JV will also look into developing infrastructure apart from setting up a JV low-cost airline.

Point of view
Equity markets hit a 3-week high this week, gaining ~46 points week-on-week to reverse the trend of declining W-o-W returns since early-November.
Although activity levels remained largely dull in the holiday-shortened week, the benchmark Index hit a 3-week high of 6369.26 points as the Central Bank held policy rates steady as widely anticipated.
Despite this, overall activity levels remained largely muted with both institutional/HNI and retail investors opting to remain on the sidelines. Institutional/HNI investors accounted for ~32% of total market turnover, cf. to the average of ~35-40% recorded this year.
Retail investors also continued to remain on the sidelines yet again this week, continuing a trend that has dominated markets through most of 2016 and 2017.
Due in large part to the steady foreign flows and local HNI/institutional activity this year though, average daily turnover levels in 2017 has averaged Rs.0.92Bn, ~25% higher than the average of Rs.0.73Bn recorded in 2016 but ~31% lower than the average of Rs.1.06Bn recorded in 2015.
Maintaining the trend that has dominated emerging and frontier market equities in 2017 meanwhile, foreign investors remained net buyers (Rs. 0.11Bn) once again this week, reversing the net selling position it recorded early in the week.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to consolidate at the current levels in the week ahead as investors return to markets post the Christmas/New year holidays.
CBSL holds rates steady for sixth time
As widely expected, the CBSL held policy rates steady (SDFR=7.25%; SLFR= 8.75%) at its 8th and final monetary policy meeting for the year.
The move marks the sixth consecutive time that the CBSL has held policy rates steady since its 25Bps hike in Mar'17.
The monetary authority cited lower-than-anticipated Q3 GDP growth (3.3% Y-o-Y vs. 4.0% Y-o-Y in Q2'17) along with contained core inflation levels, declining private credit demand and broadly stable LKR as supporting its decision.
The CBSL noted meanwhile, that despite near term growth prospects remaining subdued, it anticipates a recovery in 2018 due to a continuous surge in exports and investments induced by FDIs.
The monetary authority also noted that although high food prices stemming from supply disruptions could cause headline inflation levels to remain at relatively elevated levels in the immediate future, inflation is expected to return to desired level by Q1'18.
The CBSL also noted that it expects year-end gross official reserves to improve to $7.8Bn, helped by receipts such as the 4th tranche of the IMF's EFF, the first installment from the divestment of Hambantota Port ($292Mn) and net dollar purchases by the CBSL amounting to $1.7Bn.
The monetary authority also noted that during the year, it has been able to reverse the declining trend in gross official reserves and the negative BoP balances during 2015 and 2016, and that it expects a significantly large BOP surplus during 2017.

Ball tampering claims ridiculous says Anderson
SYDNEY, Sunday: England pace bowler James Anderson has described as ridiculous accusations that he was involved in tampering with the ball during the drawn fourth Ashes test against Australia in Melbourne last week.
The 35-year-old was shown on television appearing to try to scuff up the ball with his thumbnail on the fourth day on Friday and local commentators seized on the footage as the match meandered to a draw.
England coach Trevor Bayliss, however, labelled the accusations as Pommie bashing while Anderson scoffed at the suggestions.
It escalated quite quickly, didnt it Anderson said in comments published by Britains The Telegraph newspaper. Ridiculous, but what weve come to expect.
(I was) getting dirt off the ball. Theyd watered the square so the footholes on the old wickets had mud.
We went to the umpires to make sure they were happy with it.
Andersons comments echoed those of Bayliss, who said the umpires had told him on Saturday the accusations were a beat-up.
Both sides had been warned by the umpires during the match about deliberately throwing the new ball into the ground to scuff it up in a desperate attempt to exert some assistance from a drop-in pitch that offered both sides little help.
Australia had already regained the Ashes before the Melbourne game after they took a 3-0 lead in the five match series following victory by an innings and 41 runs in Perth.
In Melbourne, however, England dominated for much of the match, led by Alastair Cooks unbeaten 244 and were thwarted by rain that washed out much of the fourth days play.
Anderson, undoubtedly on his last Ashes tour of Australia, said his side were looking ahead to try to grab a face-saving victory in the fifth test in Sydney, which starts on Thursday.
We have played well at times in all four tests, Anderson said.
It would be nice if we can carry that on and have one last push at Sydney and try to get a win.
It would mean a lot to the lads and all the English support weve had over here. You see them just non-stop and it means a lot to us that sort of support.

Be your first critic!
Many have been transfixed by Andrew Obeyesekeres music. Andrew is well grounded because of his down to earth attitude and his talent in music has made him one of the great avatars of music in Sri Lanka. Melodies features Obeyesekere, a onetime band member of the sensational band Stigmata, whose versatility and open mindedness to new ideas has granted him success in his journey.
The journey with Stigmata was an interesting one where three college students stuck together for 17 years having fun and doing music. You know how that goes We had ups and downs like everyone else. Looking back now, I wouldnt really want much of it to be any different because that journey made me who I am today.
I was always involved in music from a very young age. I was just drawn to the Guitar. I started fooling around with the Guitar when I was 13, but only got really serious when I was about 17 when Stigmata was just forming. After that I heard some greatly skilled guitarists and I thought thats what I wanted to do. I cant explain why Im passionate about music but I can say without it Id feel suffocated, said Obeyesekere.
Stigmata was memorable and their experiences as a band will always be cherished by all the band members.
I focused on doing original music when I was with Stigmata, and most importantly the fans gave our music a chance. And I do appreciate all of those that gave us a chance. I changed my path from Metal to commercial music early this year. So far it has been fun and a great learning experience I would say. Ive realized that I was too focused on technique always. So currently Im with DeeZonE lead by Damian Wikkramatillake. We perform at Curve bar on Fridays and Saturdays at the Margarita Blue, explained Obeyesekere.
Always humble and always modest Obeyesekere is like a human sponge, absorbing experiences and absorbing everything that takes place around him.
I want to be a better musician. I guess with Stigmata, 2006-2010 was my peak and I guess I was known for my skills and technique and the melodic hooks with Stigmata. Now I consider myself a beginner once again, Im learning to be a more versatile musician always learning new styles, pointed out Obeyesekere.
When it comes to ideas with musicians like Obeyesekere, when it flows it flows! They can be inspired by anything.
I havent been writing any music for a while because Ive been busy with my other work. But when ideas happen there isnt a time or a place. Sometimes when its with a band we bounce ideas off each other. Sometimes hearing an awesome piece of music can also inspire us to come up with other musical ideas. So I guess there is a whole lot of inspiration all around us, said Obeyesekere
Hollow Dreams, Silent Chaos Serpentine and Psalms of Conscious Martyrdom had the wow factor!
At Stigmata, obviously we did the music that we liked to do since the beginning. We had a formula and a strange way of getting our ideas together. Hollow Dreams being our first album, it was very raw but melodic, and we learned a lot from Shobi Perera at the time.
Silent Chaos Serpentine the second album, to me was the best finished Stigmata album. We also had the guidance of Shafi who produced that album with Shobi Perera.
The third album Psalms of Conscious Martyrdom had great ideas but honestly I wasnt happy with the production. Im not blaming anybody, it was in our hands and we rushed it, and I feel its lacking the perspective of a single producer, because there were too many of us trying to chip in with lots of ideas.
The final and the 4th album although quite technical is where I started to realize the musical direction is not what I wanted to pursue, added Obeyesekere
Andrew is hoping to do some instrumental rock music of his own. However he hasnt started writing yet as he is busy with work and performing in the commercial scene now.
I have a love for music that inspires me and every single person who appreciates it. Im going to give a very different message to people out there. Try to be the best that you can be but dont try to be better than everyone else. Stay focused on your goals. Be your first critic. Try to learn the good from others and leave the bad out. Dont feel ashamed to say you dont know something. Be a sponge. Be humble. Help others to succeed in their endeavors. There is nothing to lose, except you are going to be a part of their success too. This attitude will only improve you and the industry you are in. Success will follow!, explained Obeyesekere
There are many artistes that Obeyesekere admires such as - instrumentalists such as Joe Satriani, Jason Becker, Yngwie Malmsteen, Steve Vai, etc. Locally theres some world class talent that he respects and admires. Guitarists such as his first guitar teacher Tony Ferdinandus, then theres Duleep Chammugam, Kamal Perera, Primal Liyanage, Derek & Shafi, Pathum Malla.
Then theres the younger generation -Ravin David, Nifal Ibrahim, Dihan Karunaratne, Joshua Perera, Sheahan Davadoss.
Currently Obeyesekere likes to make some new music and also improve his business. Also having fun and enjoying life while doing it, is a priority of his!
I guess music has a spiritual quality and Im sure it is experienced by most people. The world is full of people from different walks of life. Therefore it is very easy to disagree on a lot of things. But music can give these people some common ground. It can create harmony within society as well. Music has the power to make people achieve great things and find greater meaning in life. Only if the music is meaningful, summed up Obeyesekere.

CHALLENGES IN REVERSING SOCIAL REGRESSION
A careful analysis of the developments in diverse fields in this country over the last fifty years or so leaves little doubt that Sri Lankan society has been on a gradual, regressive path in the recent past. This proposition may appear to be inconsistent not only with the outward appearance of material change like infrastructure development but also with much touted positive indicators of social and economic development like literacy, life expectancy and income. But, when we look at the developments in such diverse fields as politics, the arts, public service, academia, professions, civil society, and social institutions, you begin to think hard. Once again, the proposition advanced above may appear to be inconsistent with what is visible in each of these fields today.
All those who are active in these fields are far more visible, vociferous and pretentious today in comparison to their counterparts several decades back. Yet, a closer examination of the present state of affairs in the relevant fields would point to a very different picture.
What is outlined above is a wide ranging and complex narrative that can be simplified by way of a few illustrative examples from a number of fields. The rest of this article is devoted to this purpose. An overall, general observation that can be made at the outset is that the visible quantitative expansion of diverse fields such as education, politics, health, infrastructure, public service, the private corporate sector, the voluntary sector, and modern professions has concealed the steadily declining quality and standards in most of the above fields. While it is true that there are pockets of excellence or isolated positive examples in various fields, the general trend of deterioration is an empirically verifiable fact.
Let me begin with the less controversial areas of music and drama. There cannot be any doubt about the fact that the country witnessed a renaissance in music, drama and other related fields several decades back. Many people still talk about and enjoy the cultural products from that period. In more recent years, there has been a visible expansion of artistic activities such as reality shows, private and public institutions providing training in diverse artistic fields, talent shows, proliferation of media institutions, etc. but no one is talking about a cultural renaissance today.
As is well known, both the general and higher education sectors have expanded steadily over the last half a century or so. Student enrollment in schools increased rapidly during this period reaching universal primary enrollment. The number of universities has increased fourfold over the same period.
Education bureaucracy
There are over 250, 000 teachers employed in nearly ten thousand public schools. Meanwhile education bureaucracy has also expanded steadily over time. Despite this unprecedented, quantitative expansion of the general education sector, there are clearly visible signs of declining educational standards measured in terms of skills of both teachers and their products. For instance, it would be surprising if even ten percent of the teachers in state schools have a reasonable level of competence in a second language at a time when the state has adopted a trilingual policy for the country and the rapidly changing local and global environment demands both teachers and students to be at least bilingual.
In this Internet age, anyone with multilingual skills can have access to an ever expanding body of literature relating to almost anything under the sun. But a large majority of our teachers and their students in most schools in the country cannot make effective use of this enormous resource due to their poor language skills. The current general education system that measures educational achievement by the grades that students acquire at examinations has effectively deskilled several generations of youth in the country. The situation is not much better within the higher education system.
As is well known, poor English language skills among university students prevent them from making use of library resources available at the Universities, let alone Internet-based literature. As is the case with school teachers, the language skills of many university teachers have also declined over the years. This situation has forced many university students, particular in the liberal arts stream to rely almost entirely on lecture notes, handouts and a few publications available in their mother tongue. This is not an environment conducive for intellectual development of university students and the expansion of their knowledge and skills. This situation has emerged in a country where a truly cosmopolitan atmosphere prevailed in the few local universities about half a century earlier.
Intellectual elite
University academics originating from diverse socio-cultural and linguistic backgrounds merged into a broadly unified intellectual elite. The situation became worse with the establishment of universities in the provinces with inadequate human and material resources. The result was that many university students could remain confined to their own provinces, without having any contact with fellow students in other provinces or senior faculty members in other universities. This naturally reinforced their regional rather than national identities at a time when university students and graduates needed to transcend primordial divisions in society. What is also significant is that the emergent situation remained largely concealed from the outside world.
Largely monolingual school leavers and university students rarely interact with English speaking elites in urban centres and vice versa. Look at the audiences at many seminars, workshops and conferences held in Colombo on a regular basis.
Declining standards of university education have also been accompanied by a chronic neglect of research and development in almost all sectors. As a result, many research institutes and research centres established in the country after Independence have by and large declined in the recent past. Inadequate funding and continuous brain drain have made the situation worse. The poor state of agricultural research centres in different parts of the country is indicative of the general trend over time. Research institutes in other fields do not seem to have done any better.
This is an alarming situation at a time when many countries even in the developing world compete for FDI and export markets on the strength of their highly skilled human resources and technological capabilities. Backwardness of industrial research is obvious and this is partly related to the collapse of many primary industries after liberalization in the late 1970s. While we have not paid any attention to modern industrial research focused on new industrial products and processes, both the elites and common people have simply become voracious consumers of imported industrial goods, ironically brought from recently developed Asian countries like Korea, China, Malaysia and Singapore. Almost all these countries were not more developed than Sri Lanka about fifty years back.
State intervention
Post-colonial historians like David Ludden (2005) have documented the process of emergence of a development State in South Asia. The focus was mostly on India during the British colonial rule and post Independence India under enlightened leaders like Nehru who made every effort to modernize the country by driving it away from caste, religion and superstition in favour of equality, science and practical application of empirical knowledge. The idea of planning was accepted as the cornerstone of state intervention.
Many state institutions were established including the National Planning Council to steer the process forward. Post Independence Sri Lanka did follow a somewhat similar path in the first two decades or so since Independence. Yet, religion in Sri Lanka emerged as a dominant force influencing public policy, pushing modern science to the background. The idea of secular education never got rooted in this country, let alone the idea of a secular state. Yet, progressive education reforms introduced in the early 1940s, focused on the central school system, showed great promise but were later subverted by vested interests, resulting in the de facto segregation in education on ethno-linguistic lines preparing the ground for social and ethnic conflicts that followed.
Regressive nature of social and economic transformation soon became evident in almost all spheres. While the public sector became the main source of employment for the upwardly mobile social groups, including rural youth, in the initial years, state institutions played a significant role in addressing diverse social and economic issues in society. Progressive legislation and newly established institutions in such areas as land development, public transport, labour relations, cooperatives, social security and rural development played a catalytic role in bringing about positive social and economic change in the country in the 1950s and the 1960s.
A vibrant rural development movement, an extensive multi-purpose, cooperative movement, a rural womens movement called Mahila Samithi and the mobilization of the farming community in all parts of the country around modern farming techniques were largely the result of state interventions through specialized institutions established for the renewal of the rural sector. Yet, the declining quality of education and the deterioration of standards in politics and public service, particularly after economic liberalization, adversely affected the functioning of state institutions.
Increasing politicization of state institutions often undermined their effective functioning leading to loss of productivity, efficiency, poor quality of service delivery, etc. While the state policy after economic liberalization in 1977 emphasized the role of the private sector in almost all spheres, public services declined in significance. For instance, agricultural extension services took a backseat, while the market forces began to dominate the agricultural sector. In the face of growing economic and social pressures, many farmers abandoned farming and some committed suicide under the weight of increasing indebtedness. Many rural youth began to migrate to urban areas or left the country in search of more lucrative employment in the Middle East and elsewhere.
Social and political unrest
So far, in this article, an attempt has been made to advance the argument that the process of social, cultural and political change in Sri Lanka in the recent past has been a regressive one. The deterioration of state institutions in general over time is one clear example. The decline in standards in public service in particular and public life in general constitute another case in point. Of course, many other examples from diverse fields can be cited and exceptional cases can be found but the pattern remains more or less the same. Present public disenchantment and the social and political unrest in the country are at least partly indicative of the fact that many people have been able to sense the direction of change. On the other hand, understanding the negative trend is of little use if no attempt can be made to explore the possibilities of reversing it. It is in this context that understanding the causes of change is important. It is by addressing these causes that we can hope to bring about the desired changes.
On the other hand, many people have also been able to achieve their life goals thanks to the deteriorating conditions. As is well known, popular politics, religious revival and ethno-religious discord created unprecedented opportunities for many people to achieve a great deal in their lives in terms of material advancement and social influence. Most of them would have been non-entities in a society guided by knowledge based institutions, reason and modern values. So, any attempt to reverse it would naturally be resisted by people with vested interest. The present social and political contestations around national integration, religion and public policy reforms demonstrate this reality in no uncertain terms.
Yet, Sri Lanka can no longer afford to allow the regressive trend discussed above to persist. For what is at stake are the countrys prospects for sustainable development, social and political stability and improving the quality of life of the ordinary citizens.

Crackdown on corruption
President Maithripala Sirisena has finally been handed over a commission report. That President Sirisena genuinely requires corruption eradicated is a fact we all acknowledge without doubt. At the same time, we fervently hope that Mr. President would not follow the footsteps of his predecessors who are noted for appointing various commissions.
Appointing commissions has become the saviour of Sri Lankan politicians. For the last ten years, our governments have appointed several hundred commissions. We have spent millions and millions of taxpayers money on these commissions.
But if we study the outcome of these commissions, we can say that it is almost zero. Some commissions have not submitted their reports. Most reports have been released, though they gather dust under someones table.
When there is a problem in the country, politicians will immediately appoint a commission. The issue may be a high profile fraud. It may be some kind of disaster. It may be a terrible accident owing to negligence. It may be a flop of an important project. As for politicians, they will appoint a commission. The commission will take several months to prepare the report. People will forget about the problem during that period. That is what politicians want. If people raise queries about the problem, the politicians will say wait till the commission report is out. This is a delaying tactic. This is a tactic to play out the people. A tactic for politicians to survive! A tactic to deceive people!
We have ministries, departments, corporations and senior officers to execute various jobs. They are highly paid. They are given all luxury facilities. When there is a problem in the country, these people should solve. Why appoint commissions What is the use of those highly paid officers
By appointing commissions, they make no one responsible or accountable for the mistakes or blunders done by their friends, relations and party supporters.
If the officers responsible do not execute what is expected of them, the higher authorities should sack them and appoint people who can do the job. Do not give that job to a commission, please!
We can judge the weakness and the incapability of a leader by the number of commissions he is appointing.

Delay in prosecution: State to pay compensation
The Supreme Court has recently held that the Fundamental Rights of three petitioners guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution had been violated by police for their inaction which resulted in the long delay in prosecuting the suspect who is said to have killed the petitioners close relative in 2010.
Accordingly, Supreme Court three-judge-Bench comprising Justice Eva Wanasundera, Justice Priyantha Jayawardena and Justice Vijith K. Malalgoda made an order directing the state to pay Rs.150,000 as compensation to the three petitioners who are the mother, brother and sister of the deceased for non-effective prosecution of the murder of their close relative for almost six years.
It was revealed that the case was called before the Moratuwa Magistrates Court for over a period of 4  years to obtain the instructions from the Attorney General.
The Petitioners to this Fundamental Rights petition namely, M. W. Leelawathie Hariot Perera, W. W. Raj Lakmal Fernando and W. W. Roshini Shivanthi Fernando who are the mother, brother and sister of the deceased Rumesh Liroshan Fernando had filed the present application before this court alleging, that their Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) and Article 11 had been infringed by then IGP N. K. Illangakoon and Officer-In-Charge of the Moratuwa Police station or any person acting under their supervision, direction or command.
The Petitioners main complaint before the Supreme Court was the inaction which resulted in the long delay in prosecuting the suspect, who is said to have killed their close relative.
When this matter was supported on October 29, 2015, Court after considering the matters placed, had granted leave to proceed for alleged infringement of Articles 12 (1) and 11 of the Constitution. As submitted on behalf of the Petitioners, deceased Rumesh Liroshan Fernando who was only 20 years at the time of his untimely demise, was a victim of a stabbing which took place on October 24, 2010.
The victim had succumbed to his injuries at Kalubowila Hospital, and the Police Officers who investigated into the death of the deceased, had reported the facts before the Magistrate of Moratuwa on 25.10.2010 under B Report No 1677/10.
The 4th Respondent to the present application namely Widanalage Amesh Asantha de Mel who is said to have stabbed the deceased, was arrested by the police and produced before the Magistrate and remanded to the fiscal custody on 26.10. 2010.
The complaint of the Petitioners before the Supreme Court is based on the subsequent investigation carried out by the Police, and the failure by them to expeditiously prosecute the case against the suspect before the Magistrates Court of Moratuwa or in other words inaction by the police officers who investigated into the said offence to prosecute the offender.
In this regard, the Petitioners have placed the following material before this court.
(a). Since 26.10.2010, the date in which the suspect was produced before the Magistrate Court of Moratuwa, the case was called from 04.11.2010 until 23.06.2011 for nearly 07 months for further investigation and for the Post Mortem Report.
(b). When the case was called before the Magistrate Court on 23.06.2011, police had informed the Magistrate that they were filing the investigation reports and plaint and the Magistrate had thereupon made order fixing the matter for inquiry on 07.07.2011.
(c). When the case was called before the Magistrate on 07.07.2011, the Magistrate found that the police had not forwarded the reports and were not ready for the inquiry and therefore the matter was re-fixed for inquiry on 21.07.2011.
(d). On 21.07.2011 the police once again moved for further time to obtain instructions from the Attorney General, and the Magistrate made order allowing the said application.
(e). Since then, the case was called before the Magistrate Court of Moratuwa on several dates over a period of 4  years, to obtain the instructions from the Attorney General, the 5th Respondent to the present application.
(f) At the time the FR petition was filed before Supreme Court on September 25, 2015, the matter before the Magistrate Court of Moratuwa, was still pending for Attorney Generals Advice.
In addition to the sequence of events which took place from the untimely death of the deceased Rumesh Liroshan Fernando, the Petitioners have further submitted that, the said delay in prosecuting the offenders before the appropriate court had resulted,
(a) The deceaseds father W. W. Philip Ranjan Fernando, gradually losing faith in the System of Justice as the case was unduly being prolonged, become ill and prematurely passed away on 05.08.2012 at the age of 65 years.
(b) The three Petitioners suffered severe mental stress, trauma due to the non-effective prosecution of the murder of their close relative for almost 6 years.
When the notices were sent on the Respondents, the 1st Respondent who came before Supreme Court, had tendered his objection along with a document. By the said document the Attorney General on November 30, 2015 had directed the Head Quarters Inspector of Moratuwa to commence a Non Summary Inquiry against the suspect Amesh Asantha de Mel under section 296 of the Penal Code for the murder of Rumesh Liroshan Fernando.
When the matter was taken up for argument before Supreme Court, the Deputy Solicitor General who represented the 1st to the 3rd and the 5th Respondents had submitted that, the Non Summary Inquiry has now commenced before the Magistrate Court of Moratuwa, after receiving the instructions from the Attorney General.
Deputy Solicitor General, referring to the journal entries filed before Supreme Court had further submitted that, the decision to refer the extracts for the advice of the Attorney General was taken by the Magistrate, and the said decision by the Magistrate cannot be questioned in the present proceedings since it amounts to a Judicial action.
In his judgment, Justice Vijith K. Malalgoda observed that from the material already discussed, it is also clear that the Petitioners have not being able to establish that the suffering and the trauma complained by them was in fact faced by them as a result of the inaction by the 1st to 3rd and 5th Respondents.
I hold that the Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution had been violated by the conduct of the 1st to the 3rd Respondents or by their agents.
In the said circumstances I make order directing the state to pay Rs. 50,000 as compensation to each Petitioner, Justice Malalgoda added.
Counsel Chrishmal Warnasuriya with Anslam Kaluarachchi and Priyanka Thevendrean instructed by Indunil Wijesinghe appeared for the Petitioners.
Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the 1st to 3rd and 5th Respondents.

Sigiriya: the eighth wonder of the world
Designed to make a difference
Natures awesome beauty and the ingenuity of mankind come together majestically at Sigiriya Rock. A massive 320-meter granite stone set incomprehensibly in the jungle, the Lion Rock was attracting admiration long before King Kassapa built his castle on top of it, and continues dropping jaws today.
Sigiriya is probably the top touristic sight in all Sri Lanka, and for good reason. There is an incredible amount to see here, the history is fascinating, the ascent to the summit is an attraction in itself, and from the top, among the ruins of an ancient palace, the view over the surrounding jungle is unimpeded and breathtaking. A visit to Sigiriya is truly unforgettable.
After crossing the moat to enter the grounds, youre greeted by the marvelously restored 5th century pleasure gardens of King Kassapa. First, a Water Garden with an expansive and complicated set of pools and ponds, and further ahead the Kings Boulder Garden. Here, we saw the Cobra-Hooded Cave and talked with an archaeologist at work on a dig. His team was unearthing a cave temple, and he was more than happy to take a break to chat. Long before Kassapas arrival, Buddhist monks had considered Sigiriya a sacred place, and built temples around the base of the rock. Kassapa relocated the monks to nearby Pidurungala Rock, where they remain to this day.
We started our ascent up the Lion Rock at 7 am in the morning, well before the sun was at full strength. This was a wise decision; we avoided both heat stroke and the eventual onslaught of tourists. We were able to climb unhurried and took our time admiring the scenery. By noon, bus after bus had pulled up to the gate. Already on our way back down, we watched a never-ending single-file line of sweaty, sun-beaten tourists with amazement and despondency. To be caught in the middle of that would have been a nightmare! I estimated about 200 people ascending the stairs at one time. I have no idea how many people visit Sigiriya daily but the government must be raking it in. So a word to the wise: go as early as you can. The gates open at 7, and youll have the rock largely to yourself.
Midway up, we encountered the Mirror Wall and the Hall of Maidens. The rock at the Mirror Wall had been polished smooth and flat and coated with a shiny plaster, so that the King could admire his reflection during his ascent. Facing the west, the wall must have shone brilliantly during sunset, and was perhaps meant as a sort of beacon, announcing the palace and the eminence of its king. Today, though, the luster is gone and it looks basically like a stone wall. Maybe a little flatter than normal. Much more impressive is the fresco gallery, found just above the Mirror Wall. The Damsels of Sigiriya are some of the most famous ancient paintings in the world, in a miraculous state of conservation.
After the Mirror Wall and damsel gallery, we emerged at a large terrace. We were exhausted and stunned to see that we had only completed about half our journey. Before us, two immense lion paws carved out of the rock indicated the beginning of the ascents second half. Under the pretense of admiring the lion, we took take a break before climbing up to the summit.

Dont break elections laws, Mangala tells UNP candidates
This LG election is held by a government which pledged to uphold good governance, so I request you to campaign without breaking election laws, Finance and Media Minister and Matara District United National Party (UNP) Organiser Mangala Samaraweera said.
He was addressing the UNP nominees and party organisers after launching the UNP campaign for the forthcoming LG polls.
Even Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe volunteered to appear before the Presidential Commission investigating the Central Bank Bond issue because his name was mentioned many a time during the course of the investigation. No preferential treatment was shown to President Maithripala Sirisenas brother when the vehicle he was driving met with an accident and was held in remand custody for 14 days. Therefore, you have to adhere to the election laws when you commence your campaign today, the Minister said.
You do not need to spend extravagantly on propaganda material for the election as you have ample time to visit every household within your ward. You have to canvass for the party as you do not have to fight each other for preferential votes. Make sure you canvass within the boundaries of your ward.
In 1989 when I first contested, my supporters who were not aware of the Matara District boundaries had even pasted my posters and put up cut outs even in the Hambanthota district, Minister Samaraweera said.
He said the government had pledged to develop the country within its tenure and as the Finance Minister he was in a position to allocate a bit more to the Matara District with the consent of the Prime Minister and the President.
At such a time, it would do good if you have a majority in all the local government bodies in the District. he said.
UNP nominees for the forthcoming LG elections and party organisers including Minister Samaraweera partook milk rice on the dawn of the New Year before launching the UNP election campaign.
The campaign launch was held at the Buddhist College Auditorium, Matara.

Dynamic Dance
Near Borupana Junction down C P de Silva Mawatha, Moratuwa, a few yards away from Galle Road, to the sound of the rhythmic beat of drums, I met the globally renowned choreographer, ChandanaWickramasinghe. A proud resident of Moratuwa, he pleasantly directed me to his office room by stretching his arm in rhythmic style.
Who inspired you to select dancing
My mother and father are civil servants. All my relatives are professionals as desk officers or degree holders. Though I got through my Advanced Level in Biology, I chose into this track by going against their expectations. My uncle, Prof. HemaWijewardhene, who knew about my desire sent me to India to the University of Vishwa Bharathi to learn Kathakali. The founder of the institute is Rabindranath Thagor. I obtained a Diploma in Kathakali.
Who taught you the very first step
I salute my first teacher at Chitrasena School of Dancing. From there I joined Kulasiri Budhawattes Dancing AcademyMy Wes Mangalya was held by him.
how did you excel from there
I travelled performing dance items in more than 75 countries for eight years. In 1987 I played the main role of the Sama ballet and played the main role in many ballets directed by RavibanduVidyapathi, Prof Mudiyanse Dissanayake and choreographer Manjusri Chaki Sarkar, in Calcutta.
What about your perfor mances in Sri Lanka
I always played the main role in the dancing performances organized by the dancing academy Dancers Guild of Sri Lanka. Our productions were not limited to the stage alone but we have also contributed to films like Abba, Kusapaba, Pattini and Alikathawa. There is a queue of films requesting my students to perform in them. My team will also perform in the upcoming film Yasodhara which is directed by Prof. Sunil Ariyaratne. My first ballet was Mayura Sandeshaya which was performed in Sri Lanka and abroad in 2014. It ran into a full house audience everywhere.
Do you have academies anywhere else
Yes, I have more than 4000 students in Kandy, Kiribathgoda, Gampaha and Nittambuwa. The 30 professionals who learnt under me are teaching them in those academies. They are taught steps of traditional, fusion, folk, freestyle and sphere. I promote Sri Lankan tourism depicting our culture in my style all over the world.
What are the shortcoming in the field and how do you propose to overcome them
There is a bad mafia on the dancing field in Sri Lanka. Most of these choreographers have dominated and monopolized the industry without allowing budding young dancers to excel in the field. It is time the media took note of this matter.
It is important to learnt the correct steps to excel as a dancer in the field. I have sent messages to these so called trainers to consult me but they never come. Even the dance costumes in these academies do not match. I have thousands of lovely costumes. I have offered them to them but they never come.
They are like frogs in a well. I am prepared to take in their students and allow them to travel abroad, not for lucrative purpsoes. I have thousands of opportunities available for them.
I am performing only in Colombo but I take my team to rural areas too to teach children what real dancing is.

Edersons penalty save preserves Citys unbeaten record
LONDON, Sunday: Crystal Palace, who missed a stoppage-time penalty, became only the second team to take points off Manchester City in the Premier League this season when they held the runaway leaders to a 0-0 draw at Selhurst Park on Sunday.
City, who drew 1-1 with Everton in August, extended their unbeaten run to 21 matches this season but their winning streak was halted at 18 by a resolute Palace defence despite throwing everything at them in a dominant second half.
Palace earned a penalty in stoppage time when Raheem Sterling brought down Wilfried Zaha but the normally reliable Luka Milivojevic had his spot kick saved by Ederson.
With Palace defending high and breaking fast, the closest that City came to a goal was when substitute striker Sergio Agueros shot took a slight deflection off a defender and hit the post midway through the first half.
Aguero had come on for Gabriel Jesus, who was the second player to come off injured after Palace captain Scott Dann -- and the third altogether with City playmaker Kevin De Bruyne carried off in added time, meaning City finished the match with 10 men. Protect all the players -- that is all I ask, Guardiola said when asked if Jason Puncheons tackle on De Bruyne deserved a red card. We could have dropped points before. Eighteen wins in a row in unreal.
Chasing a third straight 5-0 win against Palace, Citys top two goalscorers -- Raheem Sterling and Aguero -- were both left on the bench, but that did not stop City threatening Wayne Hennesseys Palace goal on his return to the starting line-up from the off, with Bernardo Silva drilling wide two minutes in.
Palace slowly grew into the match and a mix-up between City goalkeeper Emerson and defender Eliaquim Mangala presented Christian Benteke with the chance to break the deadlock, but Mangala recovered well to block.
Aguero then came within inches of scoring five minutes later but his deflected strike came out off the post.
After the break, City really started to find their rhythm, and, after a fine, flowing move, Ilkay Gundogan curled just wide of Hennesseys goal before the Palace stopper did brilliantly to block Leroy Sanes effort.
Palace rode the storm and had a golden chance to snatch victory with 13 minutes left but Andros Townsend blazed over the top, before the roof nearly came off Selhurst Park as Zaha won Palace a penalty -- until Milivojevic fluffed his lines.
It is frustrating of course (to miss the late penalty), Palace boss Roy Hodgson said. I think that at a moment like this it is better to concentrate on the performance and how well we played.

Emirates ends 2017 on a high note
Emirates, the worlds largest international airline, is concluding another banner year of growth and innovation, marking significant milestones across its fleet, network, and product innovation initiatives, cementing its position as a market leader and industry trendsetter.
Since January 2017, Emirates has carried over 59 million passengers. The airline served over 63 million meals on its flights departing Dubai*, and moved over 35 million pieces of baggage in Dubai to its network of 156 destinations.
Emirates registered over 3,600 passenger flights on average per week, or over 191,000 flights in 2017, travelling more than 886 million kilometres around the globe, which is equivalent to over 16,000 trips to Mars.
Reflecting on the year, Sir Tim Clark, President Emirates Airline said: Despite the ups and downs of 2017, Emirates delivered steady growth and we have come out stronger and even more resilient. Throughout the year, we challenged convention and acted nimbly to mitigate challenges and maximise opportunities. We implemented initiatives to boost revenues, trim costs, and used emerging technologies to make our business and operations more agile, without compromising on quality or service. We enter 2018 with optimism, and an unflagging drive to keep raising the bar in terms of customer experience and business performance.
Emirates grew its fleet by 21 new aircraft in 2017, with 9 A380 and 12 Boeing 777-300ER deliveries, rounding off the year with 269 aircraft, and 243 aircraft pending delivery. The airline also retired 11 aircraft over the course of the year.
The airline marked 9 years of A380 operations and also celebrated its 100th A380 delivery milestone in November, strengthening Emirates position as the worlds largest operator of the iconic double-decker aircraft. The Emirates A380 has carried over 90 million passengers since its introduction in 2008.
Powering its fleet expansion and future growth, Emirates made global headlines at the Dubai Airshow when it placed a US $15.1 billion for 40 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. The order will enable the airline to maintain a young and efficient fleet, complementing its Boeing 777 and A380 fleet by providing more flexibility to serve a host of new destinations and help unlock further growth.
To meet the growing demand for highly skilled commercial pilots, 2017 also saw the opening of the Emirates Flight Training Academy, one of the most advanced aviation training facilities in the world providing a complete integration of next-generation flight training. Emirates investment in the academy underscores its commitment to support and develop pilots for its own operations as well as for the broader aviation industry.
Emirates expanded its network to 156 destinations in 2017, with the addition of three new passenger destinations: Newark, USA via Athens; Zagreb, Croatia; and Phnom Penh, Cambodia.
Emirates pursued its product and service goals in 2017 with an unwavering focus on providing a strong customer-centric proposition.In November, Emirates unveiled its game-changing, fully enclosed Boeing 777-300ER First Class private suites, part of a multi-million dollar upgrade that saw enhancements across all cabin classes.
Making it easier for customers to access their flight information and manage their travel, Emirates launched a completely redesigned mobile app and web experience which included a more simplified booking process, check-in experience, Live Chat options, as well as instant redemption options for Skywards members.
Emirates continual efforts to deliver the best possible customer experience were rewarded when it was recognised as the Best Airline in the World in the inaugural TripAdvisor Travelers Choice Awards for Airlines.

Excel in dubbing
The dubbing unit of the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC) is the heart and soul of the dubbing revolution in Sri Lanka that started with the pioneering efforts of renowned director Titus Thotawatta.
Today, the dubbing industry in Sri Lanka has reached remarkable heights. Most of the credit for this achievement should go to Athula Ransirilal, who worked very closely with Thotawatta for 17 years.
With 34 years of dubbing and subtitling experience under his belt, he now heads the Dubbing Section of SLRC as its Director. The unit has won many awards under his able guidance and direction.
A versatile artiste, Ransirilal is an award-winning lyricist, screenwriter and producer. He has authored a Sinhala book encapsulating his long experience in the dubbing industry titled Handa Kevim Kalawa (The Art of Dubbing), which was launched at the SLRC premises recently.
This is the first-ever academic book on the subject of dubbing in Sri Lanka available in Sinhalese. The book will be a valuable guide not only to students in the television industry but also for anyone interested in television. It will provide advice on how to become a dubbing artiste, director, screenwriter and announcer while also focusing on succeeding at the workplace, regardless of ones job. The book is a Sadeepa Publication. Another book titled Salalihini Ransara, a compilation of articles written in appreciation of the services rendered by Ransirilal by his student Rasadari Pieris and several others will also be launched at the same event. A DVD containing his songs will also be released.

Exports earnings record double-digit growth in Oct. 2017
Maintaining the growth momentum, earnings from exports increased further registering a double-digit growth in October 2017.
This was mainly due to higher earnings from industrial exports reflecting the increase in garment exports to the USA and the EU market. Garment exports to the USA increased by 14.7%, in October 2017 while those to the EU increased by 8% with the benefit of GSP+ facility taking effect reflecting increased demand for garments.
With the healthy performance registered in vegetable, fruit and nuts preparations, earnings from food, beverages and tobacco increased during the month.
Further, earnings from rubber products rose mainly due to higher earnings from export of rubber tyres.
Export earnings from petroleum products also increased significantly owing to higher export volumes and prices of bunker and aviation fuel.
Meanwhile, earnings from agricultural exports continued to increase in October 2017 as well. An impressive growth in tea exports, with a 13.3% increase in the average tea export price and 11.3% growth in the export volume, mainly contributed to higher earnings in agricultural exports. Earnings from spices increased with higher volumes and prices of cinnamon.
Reflecting the positive impact of the removal of the ban on exports of fisheries products to the EU market and the restoration of the GSP+ facility, earnings from seafood exports increased considerably with a 145%, year-on-year, growth in exports to the EU market.
In October 2017, the USA, the UK, India, Italy and Germany were the leading markets for merchandise exports of Sri Lanka accounting for about 51 per cent of total exports.

External sector performance improves
The external sector exhibited a significant improvement in October 2017, with a notable decline in the trade deficit and continued inflows to the financial account of the Balance of Payment (BOP).
Higher export earnings, which recorded a double digit growth for the fourth consecutive month, and a deceleration in import expenditure resulted in a significant year-on-year decline in the trade deficit in October.
However, earnings from tourism increased moderately, while workers remittances further declined, owing to adverse economic and geopolitical conditions prevailing in the Middle Eastern region.
Inflows to the financial account of the BOP continued during the month amidst increased foreign investments in the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and the government securities market.
Reflecting these developments, the BOP recorded an overall surplus of around US dollars 2.0 billion by end October 2017. Meanwhile, the level of gross official reserves increased to US dollars 7.5 billion at end October 2017, particularly with the absorption of foreign currency liquidity from the domestic foreign exchange market by the Central Bank.
The deficit in the trade account contracted in October 2017 in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous year mainly due to the healthy performance in export earnings. However, the cumulative trade deficit expanded at a moderate rate during the first ten months of 2017. Expenditure on imports decelerated in October 2017 mainly due to the decline in expenditure on sugar imports owing to lower prices as well as lower volumes.
Comparatively high imports in October 2016 also impacted on the year-on-year growth of sugar imports.
Fuel imports declined as a result of low crude oil imports in volumes despite an increase in prices.
Import expenditure on investment goods declined due to lower imports of machinery and equipment led by telecommunication devices and transport equipment. There was also a decline in imports of auto trishaws and lorries.
Expenditure on construction sector related imports showed a mixed performance as building materials led by cement imports declined, while imports of iron and steel of both finished and raw forms as well as cement clinkers increased in October 2017.
However, continuing the higher increase observed since January 2017 in view of measures taken to fulfill the shortage of rice in the domestic market, volume of rice imports increased by 2,433.6 per cent in October 2017 on a year-on-year basis.
Increased clothing and footwear imports mainly contributed to the growth in imports of clothing and accessories. India, China, UAE, Singapore and Japan were the main import origins accounting for about 59 percent of total imports in October 2017.
In October 2017, tourist arrivals recorded a marginal increase in comparison to October 2016, while earnings from tourism also increased marginally during the month. The top five sources of tourist arrivals, namely; India, China, the UK, Germany and France accounted for 52.4 percent of total tourist arrivals up to end October 2017.
On a cumulative basis, tourist arrivals and earnings from tourism increased during the first ten months of 2017 compared to the corresponding period of 2016. Meanwhile, workers remittances continued to decline significantly by 12.2 percent during October 2017, as a result of adverse economic and geopolitical conditions prevailing in the Middle Eastern region. Accordingly, workers remittances declined by 7.9 percent (year-on-year) on a cumulative basis during the year up to end October 2017.
The financial account of the BOP continued to strengthen during the month of October 2017. Reflecting positive investor sentiment, the CSE marked a substantial net inflow (including both secondary and primary market foreign exchange flows) in October 2017 and during the first ten months in comparison to the net outflow recorded during the corresponding period in 2016. Foreign investments to the government securities market witnessed net inflows for the eighth consecutive month. Meanwhile, long-term loans to the government increased on a net basis during the first ten months of the year.

Global economy likely to see sustained growth in 2018
World economy is likely to see sustained solid growth with the global GDP growth accelerating slightly to a pace of 3.8 per cent, even as monetary policy becomes less accommodative, said Credit Suisse in its Investment Outlook 2018.
In addition, corporate capital expenditure, having been restrained in recent years, will become a key growth driver going forward.
Given this favorable backdrop, investors can expect still robust returns for risk assets in 2018, albeit more limited after the exceptionally good investment year in 2017, said the top Swiss bank in its report published recently.
Global inflation is forecast to reach a benign 2.7 per cent, it added.
In addition, corporate capital expenditure, having been restrained in recent years, will become a key growth driver going forward. Given this favorable backdrop, investors can expect still robust returns for risk assets in 2018, albeit more limited after the exceptionally good investment year in 2017.
The global economic growth is expected to remain robust in the months ahead, supported by both advanced and emerging markets. This continued strength implies a very low risk of a global recession.
In the US stronger corporate capital spending, a recovery in productivity and a likely fiscal boost should extend the strong business cycle for another year. (2018 Forecast year-on-year GDP growth of over 2.5 per cent).
The Eurozone is likely to see a continuation of the newfound cyclical strength barring an unlikely political crisis or a sharp appreciation of the euro. (2018 y-o-y GDP of over 2 per cent)
Switzerland is expected to benefit from a favorable export outlook given stronger global growth and a weaker CHF. The two main domestic growth drivers of recent years  immigration and the property cycle  are seen as ebbing. (2018 y-o-y GDP of over 1.7 per cent).
On the Middle East, the Credit Suisse outlook said the collapse of oil prices in 2014 led to an unprecedented process of reform across the region as governments grappled to bring the resulting fiscal deficits under control.
Many of the changes being undertaken now  reducing subsidies, introducing taxes, and economic liberalization  have been long overdue and their introduction will weigh on growth for some time.
Prices may also rise temporarily as a result of tax hikes or price liberalization. However, the negative impact should have no bearing on oil policy or the regions currency pegs, which have immense political importance.
Overall, Credit Suisse is encouraged by governments willingness to embrace change and believes the reforms will be positive for growth over a medium to long-term horizon, stated the report.
At the same time, the regions larger economies are on the verge of a step change in their integration with global financial markets. Saudi Arabia is on track to joining both the FTSE and MSCI Emerging Market (EM) indices in 2018 and should be a top 10 market in the EM universe.
Kuwait is likely to be added to MSCIs watch list for an upgrade to EM in 2018 after having secured an upgrade by FTSE recently. Plans to part-privatise state assets and increase foreign ownership limits should further add to the regions weight.
Indeed, in a blue sky scenario, Credit Suisse believes the Middle East could account for 7-8 per cent of the EM equity space  a considerable achievement given its zero weight just a few years ago. In turn this should trigger billions in portfolio inflows as both passive and active investors adjust their exposure, said the report.
Looking ahead, two key areas of risk and uncertainty stand out. First, a failure of the reforms to lift the non-oil economy would present a challenge to the regions growth outlook and raise questions over the course of government policy, stated the top Swiss bank in its 2018 outlook.
Second, further increases in intra-regional tensions could weigh on both business and consumer spending, which in turn would act as a headwind to economic recovery and raise the risk of capital outflows, it added.
The emerging economies are expected to remain a growth pillar to the global economy, with limited upside risks to inflation and interest rates as long as their currencies remain stable.
China is going to continue to play a vital role, with its growth contribution to the world economy seen as rising further given the countrys increasing weight.
As Chinas leaders remain strongly focused on stability, Credit Suisse expects a fairly smooth adjustment process with currency stability. In the longer term, high corporate debt levels remain a concern. (2018 y-o-y GDP of over 6.5 per cent)
Corporate capital spending, merger and acquisition activity and, in turn, increasing corporate debt look set to become big topics in 2018, remarked Michael Strobaek, Global Chief Investment Officer of Credit Suisse.
We expect 2018 to be a relatively good year for economic growth, which should help growth-sensitive assets continue to do well. However, we are mindful of the potential risks, whether they are of a political, economic, geopolitical or regulatory nature, he added.
This years Investment Outlook also takes a special look at the next generation of investors, the Millennials, and their priorities. With 50 per cent of the worlds population under the age of 30, this generation is becoming an influential force in the world, said the top Swiss bank in its review.
The Investment Outlook highlights energy efficiency, sustainable consumables and blockchain as three key priorities for the millennials.
Our focus is on the impact of the next generation of investors, the Millennials. Our sense is that 2018 will be remembered as the year in which they take important strides to becoming the decisive force in key realms of life, explained Nannette Hechler-Faydherbe, he head of Investment Strategy & Research at Credit Suisse.
Even after a year of exceptionally good returns in risk assets, Credit Suisse investment strategists believe that global equity markets have further upside potential in 2018, as strong economic growth boosts earnings and increases confidence. This should encourage further inflows into equities. The withdrawal of liquidity from central banks is the main challenge, particularly in the latter months of 2018.
Credit Suisse tends to favor equities over credit. Emerging market equities are expected to generate low double-digit total returns in 2018, with good prospects for small caps in particular. In developed markets, Japanese and Swiss equities are seen as offering the best potential.
Sector-wise, preferences include healthcare, telecoms, industrials and financials. Eurozone real estate equities also offer attractive opportunities for investors given still high yields.
In fixed income, Credit Suisse expects bond yields in most developed markets to rise moderately, while they should plateau in the US, at around 2.7 per cent.
In emerging markets, a particular preference is for local currency debt given the still high carry and potential for further local interest rate cuts.
In currencies, the Federal Reserves tightening steps may stabilize the US dollar, but the likely upward adjustment in European yields suggests that the euro could extend its gains, said the global banking giant in its 2018 outlook.
In commodities, robust economic growth should continue to support commodity demand and prices, with oil seen trading in a range, it stated in the Investment Outlook identifies a number of key drivers that Credit Suisse believes will shape the financial market environment in the year ahead.

How AB de Villiers is helping budding cricketers in SA
'AB de Villiers is the complete batsman on earth. I demand a DNA test of de Villiers. This game is only for humans. AB de Villiers is changing the rules of the game'  These are the praises that have been earned by the Protea man. De Villiers in his groove is probably cricket at its best. While his batting is a treat to watch for the fans, it is a nightmare for the bowlers.
Mr. 360 as he is rightly called is known to be a good man outside the field as well. He is often seen talking to the ball boys and getting to know them. These things may look simple but speak volumes about the great man. He has given literally everything to the game. The worst sight ever for his fans was the heartbreaking loss at the 2015 World Cup. Tears in his eyes had brought tears to the cricketing world.
MONETARY ASSISTANCE
De Villiers' presence in the squad has bolstered the already strong Protea side who is set to face India on January 5. The South African team recently played the historic day-night Test against Zimbabwe. According to sources, it is believed that Rand1000, R2000 and R2500 respectively are donated to SA's cricket developmental programmes for every 4, 6 and wicket in home Tests. Monetary assistance is provided to kids who can use it to realise their dreams.
A Sunfoil Educational Trust has been set up to help the budding crickets in the country. After the end of the 37th over, the SET was sitting pretty at R23,000. Since its inception, a whopping 2 million Rand has been raised. This is a great initiative in the country that can help identify young talents who can be nurtured to become better cricketers.
A RECORD AMOUNTWAS RAISED
During the Sunfoil Test series between England and South Africa that ended early this year, a record amount of R8,50,000 was raised for Willowton Group's Sunfoil Education Trust. It's great that we can contribute to such a worthy cause. We would like to make a difference and add value to any young cricketer's career. It's a great initiative and I would like to challenge all my teammates to give it their best and fight for the top spot on the Sunfoil Education Trust Leaderboard this season, De Villiers was quoted as saying by the press when asked about this initiative.
These types of schemes are both good for the country and the game. Cricket is a Gentleman's game and it must stay that way. More and more countries can come up with such initiatives for various causes that is for the greater good. - CT

Jonas wont put Golden Globe down!
Nick Jonas will hold his Golden Globe "all of the time" if he's lucky enough to win the gong.
The former Jonas Brothers star's song Home, which he penned with Justin Tranter and features in animated movie Ferdinand, is up for the Best Original Song, Motion Picture prize at the ceremony on January 7.
During an interview with Architectural Digest magazine after purchasing a new apartment in New York, Nick explained that he doesn't plan to let the statuette out of his sight if he emerges victorious.
"I think even though we have a mantel in our house in L.A. that has some awards on it, this one, if I am lucky enough to receive it, its probably going to come back to New York with me, and I will just hold it all of the time, when I walk in my house," he laughed to the publication.
When the interviewer asked if Nick would "cuddle with it" too, the singer, who is rumoured to be dating Victoria's Secret model Georgia Fowler, replied: "Yeah (and) walk into restaurants with it."
Nick added that after attending the Golden Globe after-parties last year with one of his brothers, he was thrilled to discover that winners are allowed to leave with the prize directly after their victory - while many other ceremonies require them to go back and collect the gong at a later date.
So if he does win in his category, Nick has an idea for how he wants to celebrate.
"The coolest part about the Globes is they actually give the award to you when you leave - most times you have to go back - and you just see these people sitting at dinner, just like with a Golden Globe on the table. And I thought to myself, if I am ever lucky enough, I am going to do that. Like walk into McDonalds or something," he smiled.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi
Lengthy but laudable
Many of the Hollywood movies made today rarely meet up to the standards set by their predecessors. They either harp upon what has already been done by the films on their times or stick to clichs and stereotypes.
Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a refreshing change from the other sequels. Though it is the lengthiest Star Wars movie in the franchise, director Rian Johnson has not made it a tiresome experience for the fans to feast their eyes upon the action and the images.
A cliffhanger packed with action and mystery, Star Wars: The Last Jedi the director takes on many of the questions that run through the audiences minds. Where has Luke Skywalker been, and what was he up to for all these years Who is Rey and how is she so strong with the Force Whats the deal with Supreme Leader Snoke Why did Kylo Ren turn over to the dark side Though these questions are addressed, the director does not answer them in your typical manner.
He takes the viewers in a completely unexpected direction while providing insights into the answers. All the actors play their parts well. However Mark Hamills performance as Luke is outstanding. Lukes history with the Force is captured well through his pain. The interactions between Luke and Rey are gripping too. Her scenes with Kylo too are quite intriguing. Kylo and Reys allure of the dark side and spiritual turmoil are beautifully projected in the movie. The other characters like General Leia played by Carrie Fisher, Poe Dameron taken on by Oscar Isaac, and Finn portrayed by John Boyega all add vital aspects to the story.
Johnson even introduces a few new ones with Benicio Del Toro and Laura Dern as Vice Admiral Holdo.
All the technical components come together as well. The score, editing, effects, sound design, and cinematography are well-balanced. Exciting battle scenes and intriguing twists are aplenty in this film. These add maturity to the production.
Star Wars: The Last Jedi is everything a Star Wars film should be. It is a movie which has a heart and mystery intertwined with a good acting and directing.

MR has no qualms about betraying country - Sagala
Hitting out strongly at former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his allies, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said Rajapaksa was a man who had no qualms about betraying the country to serve his family.
The Minister said his sole intention behind betraying the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and forming the flower-bud party was to find a way to bring his son, Namal Rajapaksa, to power.
Such a man will not be reluctant to betray the country for his own benefit, Ratnayaka said, addressing a meeting in Morawaka, on Sunday (31).
The Minister added that President Maithripala Sirisena was elected the President democratically and became the Chairman of the SLFP.
Then the President took measures to rebuild the party. That was when Rajapaksa decided to divide the SLFP camp. The flower-bud party was formed not for an election, but to ensure a future for the former Presidents son. It will never bloom,Minister Ratnayaka said. Even the ones who genuinely respected Rajapaksa for the military triumph over the LTTE now find it hard to vote for the flower-bud party. They have now joined us and work for the UNPs victory, Ratnayaka said.
He said under the Rajapaksa administration, two roads were built in the Morawaka area - one for the public and one for a private property allegdly belonging to the brother-in-law of the former President.
The road built for the public was washed away after a couple of showers. But, the road built for the former Presidents brother-in-law remained intact. It shows the reality of their so-called development, the Minister explained, adding that the road constructed for the public was a mere eyewash aimed at hoodwinking the people before the election.
Laying concrete or carpet on village roads is not the sole objective of development. We should empower the public - especially the less-privileged sections of society and bridge the income gaps. Thats what our government is working on, Minister Ratnayaka added.

New frontiers in journalism
This newspaper celebrates a century of publishing tomorrow. Although it has ventured into smartphone apps and websites with videos, it remains a print publication at heart. Just as radio was initially threatened by the advent of television but learned to thrive, traditional newspapers have reacted with trepidation to the rise of Internet Journalism but ultimately learned to live with it.
This newspaper itself a good example, having launched Sri Lankas first web edition of a print newspaper way back in 1995, when the Internet was in its infancy not only in Sri Lanka but also in developed countries. Since then, the Daily News website has been featuring breaking news and videos, just two items which are currently impossible with printed newspapers. Note the term currently impossible  paper thin disposable and flexible displays that can display videos may one day replace newsprint, as seen in the hit movie Minority Report. In the meantime, the physical newspaper will remain as we know it.
While almost all printed newspapers are now available on the Internet either for free or through a pay wall, there is a whole new class of newspaper that owes its existence to the World Wide Web. This is the so-called Internet or Web newspaper that has no equivalent print edition. In other words, it exists solely on the Net.
These too fall into two broad categories. There are web publications that follow certain editorial standards and ethics guidelines which generally adhere to journalistic tenets such as fact-checking and reporting both sides of a story. In the other category are web publications that follow no such norms. They just specialize in mudslinging against institutions and individuals whom they do not like with nary a thought given to truth and objectivity.
This, in a way, is the problem with the Internet. In the vast realm of cyberspace, anyone can post virtually anything and get away with it. This has given rise to the phenomenon of fake news  news that masquerades as real news but is not true at all. The recent debate over plastic rice is a clear example. There is no business case or rationale for making plastic rice, but this did not prevent thousands from sharing it online. In fact, social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter and the ubiquitous smartphones make it rather easy for fake news to travel round the world, proving the adage that a lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on. Facebook itself has admitted that it faces a huge problem due to fake news and automated feeds generated by chatbots and trolls.
It is impossible for Governments or any other body to control the social media and the wider Internet, but some form of self-regulation is essential at least for websites that engage in journalism or web publishing. Hence the recent proposal for a code of ethics for web journalists to create a more responsible and ethical web journalism, on the lines of the Code of Ethics for print and electronic media with special consideration given to the unique features of the Internet. These proposals were presented to President Maithripala Sirisena by the Professional Web Journalists Association.
The very fact the web journalists based in Sri Lanka have come together to form a professional association is a sign that they are keen to ensure higher journalistic and ethical standards. They do have a very responsible role to play as anything that they post online is picked up immediately by thousands all over the world and shared at the speed of light. The Association is thus a step in the right direction as it will lay the guidelines for responsible and ethical reporting. There is no idea yet whether independent bloggers, vloggers and citizen journalists will join this effort but the society as a whole will benefit if they do.
The boundaries between print, electronic and web media are now dissolving as they converge on each other. All print and electronic media stations have a presence on the Net while web media regularly highlight newspaper headlines and cartoons. No type of media can exist in isolation in todays 24/7 multi-media world. In the face of intense competition, they have to offer innovative content across all available platforms, including smartphone apps, Facebook and Twitter.
There is some debate over whether the traditional newspapers and dead-tree books will survive the electronic delivery revolution or disappear in the next few decades, but one thing is clear  there will always be a place for good journalism, correct news and verifiable facts. In other words, it is the content that matters and not the medium of delivery per se. As stated by C.P. Scott, the veteran editor of the Manchester Guardian which celebrated its own centenary just three years after the Daily News began publishing in Colombo, facts are sacred but comment is free.
Newspapers will survive well into the next few centuries, may be not as we know it, but offering that same emotional connection to readers who seek the truth.

New year welcomed with fireworks and prayers
UK: Revellers in Edinburgh and London spared predicted storms as they welcomed in 2018, while France and Germany held celebrations under tight security.
The forecast of strong wind in Scotland for New Years Eve did not end up affecting Edinburghs Hogmanay celebrations as the gales of up to 80mph confined themselves to other parts of the country.
London was also spared the showers that had been predicted, and tens of thousands of partygoers were able to enjoy the extravagant firework display on the South Bank without the weather dampening their spirits.
In Paris, throngs of locals and tourists headed to the Champs-lyses to attend a fireworks show at the Arc de Triomphe. Frances New Years Eve celebrations were placed under high security, following a series of attacks by Islamic extremists in recent years, and 100,000 police officers and soldiers, along with 40,000 rescuers, were deployed across the country.
Germans also rang in the new year under tight security from police mindful of widespread sexual abuse of women in Cologne two years ago and of a terrorist attack on a Christmas market in 2016.
Police in Berlin put an extra 1,600 officers on duty and said that large bags and backpacks would not be allowed on the Party Mile leading from Brandenburg Gate, where thousands celebrated at midnight. Police in Frankfurt imposed similar restrictions in the celebration area along the river Main in the countrys financial capital.
In Indonesia, hundreds of couples celebrated by getting married in Jakarta in a free mass wedding. The communal event, attended by 437 couples, was staged by authorities to ease residents struggles with bureaucracy.
Many Jakartans cannot access public services because they have never legally been married, according to governor Anies Baswedan.
If they want to celebrate their wedding anniversaries, they will not only celebrate it with their families but the whole world will celebrate with them because it coincides with New Years, the governor said.
Celebrations in Russia were hampered by technical difficulties as Palace Square in St Petersburg was temporarily evacuated and a 25-metre (80ft) Christmas tree in the east of the country went up in flames. In Moscow, the weather was less than festive. Usually blanketed with snow on New Years Eve, the Russian capital this year was suffering a long spell of intermittent rain and constant grey skies, but that did not stop the spectacular fireworks display from going ahead as planned above Red Square.
In Dubai the 828-metre Burj Khalifa, the worlds tallest building, once again served as the focal point of the new year celebrations in the United Arab Emirates, though this year authorities decided against fireworks and chose a massive LED light show.
The display, running down the east side of the tower, displayed Arabic calligraphy, geometric designs and a portrait of the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the UAEs first president. But a display of neighbouring nations flags did not show Qatars flag due to the ongoing dispute over ties to Iran and the alleged funding of extremist groups. Meanwhile, India welcomed in the new year with midnight celebrations at popular landmarks, temples, mosques, gurdwaras and churches.
In Delhi, the festivities in Connaught Place came with heightened security as police conducted breathalyser tests, while emphasis was placed on ensuring the safety of women. Security at the event was tight, but officials said there was no particular alert. It was estimated that almost half of those attending the celebrations were tourists.
In New Zealand, tens of thousands of people took to the streets and beaches, becoming among the first in the world to usher in 2018.
Fireworks boomed and crackled above city centres and harbours, and partygoers sang, hugged, danced and kissed. In Auckland, New Zealands biggest city, tens of thousands gathered around Sky Tower as five minutes of nonstop pyrotechnics exploded from the top of the 220-metre structure. In Singapore, people huddled under umbrellas to watch fireworks light up Marina Bay. Planned outdoor dance workouts and yoga reportedly had to be cancelled, but some still braved the weather to see in the new year.
Many Japanese people were celebrating the arrival of the Year of the Dog by praying for peace and good fortune at Shinto shrines, and eating traditional new year food such as noodles, shrimp and sweet black beans.
Barbecued beef and octopus dumpling stalls were set out at Tokyos Zojoji temple, where people take turns striking the giant bell 108 times at midnight, an annual practice repeated at other Buddhist temples throughout Japan.
In South Korea, thousands of people were expected to fill the streets near Seouls city hall for a traditional bell-tolling ceremony to usher in the new year.
The group of dignitaries picked to ring the old Bosingak bell at midnight included Soohorang and Bandabi  the tiger and bear mascots for the Pyeongchang Winter Games and Paralympics in February and March.

Over 180 beggars to be rehabilitated
Within the next few days, nearly 181 beggars from Colombo are to be sent to the rehabilitation centre set up in Rideegama in Ambalantota, where they will be rehabilitated so that they may be gainfully employed later.
Project Director, Ranjith Meegaswatte speaking to the Daily News reiterated that the project is aimed at giving beggars a better lease of life through education, community engagement, empowerment and self-employment.
The Government has spent 8 crores in setting up 10 buildings at Rideegama for the purpose of rehabilitation and looking out for the social welfare of these individuals, he said.
A sum of Rs. 1.5 million is spent every month to ensure that all their needs are met including food, medicare, education, clothing and shelter,Meegaswatte said.
He added that there are 480 beggars at the centre who are being well looked after.
Some of the beggars are not only destitute but individuals who are intellectually disabled. Since they are also unskilled, finding them employment in alternative occupations is very challenging. Some of them chose to stay at the centre, and the Government has no qualms about it.
The Government declared January 1st as the last day for beggars to willingly to get themselves registered so that they could be sent to this centre.
They are free to come to the office at Deans Road in Maradana or the Ministry of Megapolis, where we will do the needful. There are however those who need care, attention but are too stubborn to seek help and it is here that the police will take them and produce them to courts under the Police ordinance and Vagrants Ordinance.
Once that is been done, they will be taken to the centre,Meegaswatte addedd.
Through the same programme, we are offering an employment scheme where a beggar can earn Rs. 1500 a day through a selection of jobs offered through the Ministry. We have already received a positive initiation to this scheme, he said.
He added that women are also housed in the same location with separate hostel facilities while street children are sent to correction facilities through which they attend schools and find placements and vocational training centres.
Over the last few weeks, the governments programme to evict beggars from Colombo has drawn flak by sections of the society who have termed it as unjust.
Meegaswatte explained that the government would rather have these individuals, many of who are impoverished and helpless placed into homes where they are not only offered food, clothing and shelter but care and concern.
This is the only way we can reduce their numbers. We are providing provisions for vocational training within this centre. These individuals have a right to life, and to be productive and valued, he added.
The country needs socio-economic welfare measures to help alleviate these individuals from their impoverished lives.
This calls for a comprehensive programme, reorientation of existing programmes and policies. The rehabilitation center in Rideegama is one of many such plans, Meegaswatte said.

Prime Minister Modi-inspired film released
Nearly 11 months after it was denied a censor certificate on various grounds, Hindi feature film 'Modi Ka Gaon' - now renamed as 'Modi Kaka Ka Gaon' - loosely inspired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's development agenda, will finally hit the screens on Friday, the filmmakers said.
"In the first phase, the Hindi film will be released for around 600 screens in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, East Punjab and Uttarakhand. The rest of the country will be covered soon thereafter," film producer Suresh K. Jha told to the source.
Promos, posters and banners went up on prominent roads and several cinema halls and multiplexes in Mumbai city and suburbs, besides other cities in the country this week, heralding 'Modi Kaka Ka Gaon'. The development comes close on the heels of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) giving the censor certificate to the movie in late November. It had been refused for eight months since last February.
Jha reiterated that the film is "not a biopic on Modi", but the story has been inspired by the Prime Minister's vision and agenda for the country's progress. "I am keen that the work of the great leader should be highlighted since some people are making false propaganda and harming the country's interests," Jha said. With seven songs featuring, the music for the film is directed by Manojanand Choudhary. IANS

## Title: Shri Ranjitsinhji (born in India, Sept. 10, 1872)
## Supertitle:

## Date: Tuesday, January 2, 2018 - 01:00
Shri Ranjitsinhji (born in India, Sept. 10, 1872)
Now that the Indian cricket team has smothered us and we are licking our wounds it would be nice to dig deep and fish out a story about one of the oldest Indian cricketers by the name of Shri Ranjitsinhji (Ranji).
In W.G. Graces book Cricketing Reminiscences & Personal Recollections he stated that without doubt Ranji was one of the most interesting figures in the cricket field then. His popularity has two sources - his extraordinary skill as a batsman and his nationality. How a man of his slender physique and apparently delicate constitution has so completely mastered the art of batting as to score with outstanding rapidity and ease of all manner of bowling upon every variety of wicket was simply wonderful. Ranji laid the foundation of his cricket career in India, but he perfected himself in England. It was at Rajkumar College at Kathiawar that he learned the rudiments of the game, but it was on Parkers piece at Cambridge that he acquired the different strokes, unerring judgment which had made him famous. It is a little curious to recall that it was as a substitute that he made his first appearance in Trinity College team at Cambridge, and it is even more remarkable that the authorities at Cambridge did not think that the Indian Prince worthy of his blue until 1893. Then he qualified to play for Sussex and in his first year in county cricket played thirty three innings with an average of 41. It has been said that Sussex made Ranji and Ranji in return made Sussex. Someone has waggishly suggested that Ranji qualified for Sussex so as to make sure of playing ten innings a year, on the Hove ground, for which like most batsmen he has a partiality on account of the facility it gives to batting. Grace further adds that in Ranjis second year in county cricket, he met with remarkable success, heading the first class averages with an aggregate of 2780 runs (which surpassed Graces aggregate by 34 runs). Ten times he exceeded the century, and when playing against Sussex vs Yorkshire he made over a hundred in each innings of one match. In Australia with Stoddarts team Ranji maintained his brilliant form scoring 1372 runs in all matches, with an average of 54.88. Returning via India he made a long stay in his native land and so missed the cricket season of 1898, much to the regret of English spectators, with whom he is deservedly popular, notes Grace. Ranji is unique as a batsman. Most batsmen have one or two favourite strokes of which they are masters. Ranji has half a dozen strokes, which he plays with perfect ease and almost with mechanical precision. Some of them are what one may call unorthodox. I am afraid that when he gets older his habit of stepping in front of his wicket to play straight balls to leg will cost him his wicket, adds Grace.
Even with his wonderful hawklike, eye sight he frequently gets out leg before the wicket (if one reminisce Tillakaratne Dilshan is a classic example) trying to play to leg which keeps lower than he expected. He plays allround with extraordinary skill, but is seen at his best in a leg glance, which with him is an exceedingly pretty stroke. This was his favourite hit and delighted his onlookers. At hitting a high long hop to leg is almost infallible. Grace also stated that Ranji could drive well, as he has been showing lately but he prefers to score behind, or square with the wicket and by his genius for timing often scores to leg, or behind the wicket, off balls other batsmen would have to drive. He was comfortable with any bowling and seems to treat all bowlers with the same unconcern.
The stories about Ranji are numerous notes Grace. His puzzling name has made him the victim of every wit in the cricket field. It has been said that the newspaper compositers struck against setting his name in type, and appealed for his patronymic to be changed to Smith. But one of the best stories of the Indian Prince is vouched for by Cambridge journalist who collaborated with Ranji in writing his Jubilee Book of Cricket. When Ranji was at Cambridge he went on a tour with the Cassandra Cricket Club. A member of an opposing side inquired if that dark chap could speak English They speedily foreseeing possibilities replied seriously that he knew a few words such as Yes and No and Hows that When the unconscious Ranji went to the wicket to his great astonishment he heard some lively criticism of his batting. He made characteristically huge score, and every now and then someone will ejaculate, (this is the very word pl. publish). Here isnt it time this fellow went out Once when the ball struck Ranji in the chest and doubled him up, the fielding captain audibly hoped that it would knock some of the steam of the bugger! At the subsequent luncheon, when Ranjitsinhji rose to toast genially the home side, several faces were seen to change colour.
Among cricketers Ranji was exceedingly popular, his open heart generosity and geniality having captured all their hearts, concluded W.G. Grace.
This was the way white Sahibs treated the WOGS (Western Orientated Gents) in my time in England and some local yokels without firsthand experience still bum suck them.

Steyn waits to see if he will get chance to break test record
CAPE TOWN, Sunday: Dale Steyn has been close to the milestone for more than a year now but, at the age of 34, time is running out for the speed merchant to become South Africas most prolific wicket taker.
Steyns 417 test-wicket haul is just four shy of the South African record held by Shaun Pollock but the target remains both tantalisingly close and frustratingly elusive at the same time.
Standing between him and the tag of the countrys best ever bowler have been a serious shoulder injury and a lengthy spell on the sidelines.
After his latest piece of rotten luck, some doubt that Steyn will get his long-awaited opportunity when South Africa take on India in a three-test series starting at Newlands on Friday.
It has been 14 months since Steyns last test and the rustiness of the lay-off, plus the absence of a decent examination of his shoulder in match conditions, could see him left out, local media suggested.
There is significant, ill-advised risk associated with any fast-track return, wrote local cricket columnist Rob Houwing this week (www.sport24.co.za) after the pace bowler missed out on the Boxing Day test against Zimbabwe.
Steyns shoulder travails began against England in Durban in December 2015 but it was just under a year later in Perth in November 2016 that extensive damage was done as he broke the right shoulder and tore three major muscles on the second day of the first test against Australia.
He went home to Cape Town for surgery, followed by lengthy rehabilitation and abortive comebacks before he was gently eased back into Twenty20 action in November and then 12 wicketless overs in whites just before Christmas.
Steyn was due to return in the one-off test against Zimbabwe in Port Elizabeth last week but on the opening morning of the day-night match was unluckily ruled out by a bout of influenza.
In his absence, South Africas four-man seam attack easily bowled out Zimbabwe twice and, although India are an altogether different proposition, there is a temptation for the selectors to stick with them.
Steyn, whose test average is a staggering 22.3, can, however, point to a prolific record at Newlands with 65 wickets in 13 tests at an average of 21.93 - 12 against India.
He -- and legions of supporters enthralled by his passionate approach to the game -- wait to see whether he will get to bowl this time.  Agencies

He said the monies would be used to expand the service, train manpower, expand the capacity of the Suwa Seriya main coordination centre and for other related purposes.
Under the first stage, 88 ambulances were received. Of them, 56 vehicles were provided to the Western Province, while 32 to the Southern Province.
From the date of its inception in July 2016, over 56,000 people received the service. At least 150 people benefit from the free ambulance service daily.
Recently, the Cabinet granted approval to the government to set up an institution, Suwasariya Foundation by an Act of Parliament to expand the 1990 ambulance service island-wide.
The 1990 free ambulance service operative now in the Western and Southern provinces has been a success and from the second stage the government plans to implement the service in other seven provinces as well.

Svitolina eyes Grand Slam success
Brisbane: Ukraines Elina Svitolina believes she can become world number one in 2018 despite a host of challengers for the coveted top ranking.
Svitolina, currently ranked sixth in the world, was speaking after an impressive 6-2, 6-4 win over Spains Carla Suarez Navarro in the first round of the Brisbane International on Monday.
The 22-year-old cruised through the first set but was forced to fight harder in the second as Suarez Navarro began to find her range with powerful groundstrokes.
But the Spaniard faltered while serving at 4-5 and Svitolina was able to close out the match in just under 90 minutes.
Svitolina won five titles in 2017 on her way to a career-high world ranking of number three.
She said she had worked hard during the off-season and there was no reason why she could not win a Grand Slam or take the top ranking.
Five women held the top spot at various times in 2017, Serena Williams, Angelique Kerber, Karolina Pliskova, Garbine Muguruza and current number one Simona Halep.
Svitolina said her ability to raise her game to see off someone as dangerous as Suarez Navarro showed she was also capable of taking the next step.
This match was a good example that I can play a good level of tennis, a high level of tennis, she said.
So I will try to continue to work and to, you know, to just be focused on these kind of things.
Thats whats important for me -- and then the Grand Slam and number one is all going to come if I have my game, if Im healthy, if Im playing my best.
Svitolina will take on Ana Konjuh in the second round following the Croatians 6-1, 6-2 win over Dutchwoman Kiki Bertens on Sunday.
A miserable run by sixth-seeded Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic continued when she lost to Belarus qualifier Aliaksandra Sasnovich.
Mladenovic, who has not won a match since Wimbledon, raced through the first set before Sasnovich fought back to win 1-6, 6-3, 7-5.
In other first-round matches, 2012 champion Kaia Kanepi from Estonia beat Russias Daria Kasatkina 6-2, 6-2.
Kanepis compatriot Anett Kontaveit beat Englands Heather Watson 6-0, 6-3 and Sorana Cirstea of Romania saw off American Jennifer Brady 7-6 (7/3), 6-1.
In the mens draw Matthew Ebden set up a second-round clash with fellow Australian Nick Kyrgios when he beat Frances Tiafoe of the USA 6-3, 6-2.
There was better news for the Americans when Ryan Harrison downed Argentine Leonardo Mayer 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 to book a clash with second seed Andy Murray. AFP

Time of year to share joy of festive cheer!
A blessed and peaceful New Year morning, Sri Lanka! The festive countdown is over. The midnight candlelit services have been well attended. Now at daybreak the church and temple bells are beckoning early risers to come and worship. It is the beginning of a new era and the festive chimes along with the thunder of firecrackers are heralding an event of renewal, a season of joy and an occasion for understanding and new commitments.
We are aware that in keeping with the spirit of altruism various fundraising efforts are being initiated by individuals and businesses big and small. That is a healthy sign and augurs well for the country. Yes, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has caught on fast in Sri Lanka and is spreading commendably. It means the continuing commitment by business to behave ethically and contribute to economic development while improving the quality of life of the workforce and their families as well as of the local community and society at large.
The good news for the season is that those who work in CSR is that the issues related to better governance are steadily rising in the corporate agenda. CSR is finally being seen as a direct driver of revenue growth and profitability. This represents a huge shift from the old days when companies simply made a donation to a local charity particularly during this time of year and left it at that.
Those who believe in the merits of more socially responsible business are convincing their mainstream peer organisations that a CSR strategy, with employee engagement as its heart, can make them more profitable and productive while doing their bit for society too.
On the whole, what is being emphasised to the influential business community is that the accomplishments and contentment of running organisations comes not from drawing in the profits but from forking out from the heart for the less fortunate in society. We all have a responsibility or rather a bounden duty to do whatever within our means to offer the youth of our country a dream and vision for their future.
Critical to the success of such a mission is the powerful influence that employee engagement has in CSR and the role sustainability plays in employee motivation. Employees generally feel motivated to work for companies knowing that they actually give a thought about wider society and they are more likely to be productive and put extra effort in for those organisations.
A whole host of people have been working hard this year to make at least Christmas Day a merry one for the less fortunate. Still CSR is not just for Christmas, but should be a sustained, compelling part of any business offering. We salute every organisation and person who has given of their time, talents, resources and generosity to help the cause of human suffering. Kindness comes in many forms but all of it helps.
Earnings no longer keep pace with inflation and income inequality has become a target for sustained criticism by millions of people no longer able to share in the dream of success based on hard work. We must pay particular attention to the efforts of students this year who are learning early the importance of contributing to their community, especially in its times of need.
It feels like a holiday tradition: another Christmas, another crisis - a desperate cry for help from some charity whose survival depends on you to save the day and we cannot just be driven by business performance alone. Until our economy recovers and is restructured to allow all who follow the rules to make the gains they deserve, we will be faced with growing problems of poverty, hunger and homelessness. Thank goodness for the many, many volunteers who dont wait for someone else to step up who give and give and give some more so that someone, somewhere feels some love this Christmas and keeps it up throughout the year.
Christmas is essentially a holiday of lights. It gives a chance for everyone to light up the lives of our compatriots in need. It is a holiday in which we can all spread a little bit of hope, if only because we have socially mandated it onto ourselves that its a holiday of kindness. It is a holiday for children, not in the sense that it is immature but in the sense that they must be at the centre of it, for nothing defines a family better than a child.
Hope is a powerful force in our lives and Christmas brings hope. Christmas is also for those who have been longing for some kindness. They may have been devout in their religious observance, but still understand that their only hope is for some beneficence to come to them in the guise of compassionate fellow beings. They have been waiting for relief to show up. And it will, through us, if only we would care to extend our hands in generosity.
Preparations for the coming year are in full swing in every business  from planning marketing campaigns to projecting sales targets to hiring new faces. This is also the time for holidays and with festive cheer in the air, it is an ideal time to spread some happiness. A year-end CSR activity can do a whole lot of good for your business  you can spread some joy both among your employees as well as the more underprivileged sections of the society.
It will be harder still to believe that the seasonal cheer would really come to them, or that they would find a way to share in its universal joy. Everyone, regardless of their sundry spiritual beliefs, should reflect on the needs of the dispossessed and destitute. Nonetheless, it is the season of goodwill and not a time for criticism or for turning an intolerant eye on our disadvantaged fellow citizens.
To be sure, we are amid the season of good cheer, the time of year when every responsible Sri Lankan must make a tangible effort to help in the rehabilitation and rebuilding process of the war-ravaged and natural disaster areas in any small way possible. It is time to be supportive and restore some relief to our less-fortunate compatriots. Every Sri Lankan has a role to play in the rebuilding of our country. No one can expect the government to provide all the benefits the country needs.
The private sector also needs to chip in, to take on part of the burden to help build in the development process, the infrastructure and help in some way. To be a competitive nation, we require a large infusion of infrastructure, education and the creation of opportunities.
This is not political. This is not religious. This is not economic. This all translates into being humane. May your heart be filled with the delight of giving, as it is the expression of the love in your heart and the kindness in your soul.
Wishing you all a Christmas and a New Year filled with peace, love and joy!

## Title: US-Sri Lanka bilateral trade up to US $ 3.41 bn in 2017

US-Sri Lanka bilateral trade up to US $ 3.41 bn in 2017
The expiration of US Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) for Sri Lanka on December 31 will have only a marginal impact on the countrys exports to US. Meanwhile, Sri Lankas trade with US showed a positive trend last year in comparison to 2015 and 16.
What is important to understand is that this non-renewal of US GSP does not affect our US trade in a significant way said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen on December 29.
Minister Bathiudeen was clarifying on Sri Lankas US GSP expiration when he was meeting some top officials at his Ministry offices in Colombo recently.
The US Embassy in Sri Lanka said the United States Congress did not re-authorize GSP before adjourning for the year.
The immediate effect of GSP expiration is GSP eligible imports to the United States from Sri Lanka and other GSP beneficiary countries and territories will be subject to non-preferential duties beginning January 1, 2018 the Embassy stressed. Total Sri Lanka  US trade remained unchanged in both 2015 and 2016. In both 2015 and 2016, total bilateral trade was at $ 3.3 Bn.
The US purchased 27% of Lankas overall exports at an unchanged value of around $ 2.8 bn, each year in 2015 and 2016. Apparel products were Sri Lankas biggest export item to US, taking 75% of Sri Lankas exports in 2016 (at $ 2.1 bn). Interestingly, total US-Sri Lanka bilateral trade from January to November in 2017 has increased to US $ 3.41 bn in comparison to 2016s entire annual trade total of $3.3 bn. Of this years $3.41 Bn trade with US (to November), $2.64 Bn consists of exports from Sri Lanka.
What is important to understand is that this non-renewal of US GSP (for 2018) does not affect our US trade in a significant way and impact is even lower when it comes to total national exports. Only one fifth of our exports to US could be temporarily impacted by this routine event, said Minister Bathiudeen.
Accordingly, apparels, Sri Lankas leading exports to US at an annual value of $ 2 billion is not at all affected since apparel exports to US do not come under GSP. Only some other exports, around 20-25% of total to US, come under GSP. Most such GSP eligible exports from Sri Lanka to US are smaller value items such as travel bags, certain leather products and some pneumatic tyre types.
Also some Lankan exporters dont claim the GSP entitlement and therefore the actual value of affected exports to US is around one fifth of total annual exports to US from Sri Lanka- around 20% at $500 mn to $570 mn.
The expiration is not only for Sri Lanka but includes many other countries, taking place at the same time. Sri Lanka has one of the highest US GSP utilisation rates among other US GSP beneficiaries -at around 85%.
Sources from the Department of Commerce confirmed despite the expiration, the issuance of US GSP entitlement certificates by the Department will continue as usual and with changes to the present procedure. It was also revealed that this GSP expiration appears to be another regular event since the US GSP is routinely reauthorized every year and the expiration takes place before reauthorisation that arrives a few weeks later.
The direct beneficiaries of US GSP are US manufacturers who can avail input material for their productions at low or no duties, indirect beneficiaries being Lankan exporters. Once the reauthorisation takes place, the US importers who applied for the Certificates from Colombo and earned it, can submit their claims and collect benefits at their end retroactively. According to the Department of Commerce, apart from apparels, the other Lankan export items to US in 2016 were tyres and tea. Main import items from US to Sri Lanka were preserved oils such as sunflower, soya etc, various technical instruments (Optical, photographic, precision, medical etc) and plastics. Total imports from US in 2015 was at $ 470.8 mn and it increased by 15% to $ 540 mn in 2016. The GSP entitlement for Sri Lanka and other beneficiary countries could be renewed and returned as soon as the US Congress re-authorises it at any time.

Washed out bathroom coup
There was high drama at Katunayake when the aircraft was taxiing to a halt on the tarmac; armed guards took positions in and around the airport, hovercraft of the Royal Ceylon Air Force flew over. The BOAC aircraft which carried Army Commander General Udugama who was returning to island on July 7, 1966, touched down at Katunayake around noon. Chief of the RCyAF Air-Commodore Rohan Amarasekara, met the Army Commander at the tarmac and escorted him, preceded and followed by jeep loads of armed guards to the Air Force Officers Mess.
Sixty five percent of todays population was not born when the islands second alleged military conspiracy was staged. Ms. Udugama, two children and a few relatives awaited the arrival of the Commander, they were escorted to the Mess where Udugama was kept under detention, pending transfer to Welikada. There they were told that he would not accompany them back home. While John Attigalle, IGP served the detention order issued under Emergency Regulations, a Defence Ministry official handed over the order suspending the 54-year-old Commander.
There was silence for a few moments before the IGP, who wanted the Major General to follow him to an attached bathroom, where he was searched. Udugama was allowed to meet his family, and the family left. scotch-and-soda; gin-lime was served for the commander and top brass while they were engaged in an unfocussed conversation for about half an hour, after which the IGP accompanied Udugama to the Magazine Prison, where the formalities were over in a matter of minutes; a historic occurrence thus ended.
The next day the government issued a communiqu on his arrest, which stated: The Attorney General after examining the evidence and other materialhas advised that there is sufficient evidence to justify Udugama being placed on inquiry with a view to trial along with other suspects has been taken into.acting on the instructions of Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake, the Governor-General has suspended Udugama from office.
The head of Army was on a mission to study military training schools in England, France, Germany, and Switzerland. Director, C I D visited him in England and had discussions about the allegations against him.
Richard Udugama first accused in 1966 coup case
Udugama knew what was in store for him; he had the option of looking for asylum in a country as there were offers but the just, bold, fearless and upright officer, he decided to come back to clear his name.
All the accused had a very fair trial at the Supreme Court, at which the Jury was unanimous in declaring them not guilty; SC acquitted all of them without the defence being called. Udugama gained battle experience while serving with British Army in Burma during WWII on secondment from the Ceylon Defence Force. He was unjustly accused of attempting to take over the State in a coup dtat.
A Crown Counsel who prosecuted said-
J R, the all-powerful Minister of State, was one of the prime targets of this coup. Equally ironically, JR had his hand deep in making sure this prosecution succeeded. He personally approved the selection of Crown Counsel to prosecute and selected the Police officers to investigate the case. The known brutality of the officer selected to do the initial investigation resulted in two suspects committing suicide to avoid State terror against them. but this was State terror aimed at those who sought to  Wakeley Paul, Barrister - at - Law, Middle Temple, London.
Udugama, a Rugby Lion at Trinity was accused along with a prominent Bikkhu of the day and a totally unimportant group of low ranked sergeants. Cruel grilling of suspects caused death of two persons at the infamous 4th floor of the Police HQ. Dodampe Mudalali, a businessman, a soldier who had been in the security ensemble of Gen. Udugama were the two victims, they had been brutally tortured and physically thrown out of the fourth floor by the investigators. It became obvious that JR, leader of the House in 1966 had been tricked to settle scores for the exposure of the 1962 coup d tat which was totally led by devious and disgruntled serving and retired Navy, Army, and Police officers. Captain Wignarajah, a Sandhurst-trained soldier was a crown witness became nervous in the witness box when confronted by the defence on his evidence, proving that the statements had been obtained under duress.
Murder by State investigators
Tilekawardene and Dodampe Mudalali were said to have committed suicide by jumping from the fourth floor of the CID office, while being under interrogation.
At the inquest, the Magistrate initially returned a verdict of suicide, but later on receipt of fresh evidence altered the verdict to one of culpable homicide.
The Supreme Court made highly critical comments on the conduct of the inquest.
Sergeant Hondamuni, giving evidence at the inquest stated that when Dodampe was being interrogated, sounds of cries of murder were heard and when he opened the door he saw Dodampe Mudalali lying naked on the floor. He even heard SP Seneviratne saying throw him out.
The exceptionality of the event is that during the trial the prosecution case against Commander Udugama open itself only to expose not only the total lack of facts on any of the charges in the indictment but pointed to a situation in which he is made to seem responsible of a crime Udugama has not committed; only a victim of a politically provoked frame-up. The whole incident was proved to be a Faux Pas; with the jury unanimously declaring them not guilty, all accused were acquitted.
The government felt uncomfortable having the Army under Udugama, who was a relative of Bandaranikes and also that several pro-SLFP officials, who received promotions under Sirimavo Bandaranike in 1960-64 period, were holding positions in the Army.
The Opposition called it the bathroom coup.
Richard Udugama passed away in May 1994 at the age of 84 at his home in Matale. Full Military Honours were accorded to his remains at the funeral held at Kandy.

Were not weak: Thai trans boxer to blaze trail in France
Chachoengsao: Wearing red lipstick and a pink sports bra, Nong Rose trades blows with her twin brother in a Thai boxing gym, preparing for a foreign debut that will make her the first transgender fighter to enter the ring in France.
A few weeks ahead of the Muay Thai match in Paris, the 21-year-old is training hard in central Thailands Chachoengsao province, with her brother as sparring partner.
Boxing is part of the siblings DNA -- they learned how to jab, cross and kick from their uncle, a professional Muay Thai fighter, who started teaching them the basics when they were eight.
Since (we were) little ones, we used to fight... but she was always stronger than me, Nong Roses twin brother, Somrak Polchareon, told AFP.
In the eyes of the Thai government, Nong Rose is a man named Somros Polchareon.
But she has always felt like a girl, and started dressing like one at the age of 14.
In life as in the ring, where she competes against men, finding her place has not always been easy. When I started fighting (as a girl), I was afraid that people would not accept me, she told AFP, wiping away sweat after a feisty round of training.
While Thailand has a reputation as a free-spirited haven for LGBTQ people, discrimination abounds outside of nightlife and entertainment venues.
The boxer says her male opponents were initially rattled -- or even angered -- by her appearance.
In my village everyone knew me so it was easy, she says. But outside the city, some boxers looked at me wrong and said that trans people could not win.
Many trans Thais say they are treated like second-class citizens in a country where changing genders was considered a mental illness by the military as recently as 2012.
The practice is still not legally recognised, causing headaches for those trying to navigate medical care or bureaucratic processes.
Nong Rose, who turned professional after graduating from high school two years ago, pushed through the prejudice by racking up victories in the ring, winning half of her 300 matches. Today, she is better known for her knees of steel.
In combat, she always walks on you and hammers you with her knees, said Chalongchai Meemindee, a 25-year-old boxer known as Phetsuphan who faced Rose in November.
Its good to have her in the ring because it brings colour and attracts viewers, especially foreigners, he added. AFP

Welcome 2018..!
The night was dark and at the Gate of Time the old watchman was half asleep. Suddenly he heard the sound of eerie maniacal laughter. "Who goes there" shouted the old watchman of the Gate of Time.
"Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!" laughed a voice
"Who goes there" shouted the old sentry again wearily.
"2017!"
"Oh, it's you is it" asked the old sentry, "You sure have changed 2017! You're drunk!"
"The Earth people gave me a sendoff party! A farewell, and I drank with them as they kicked me out! I like them, I loved them watchman dear and lived just like them for the whole year I was down there on earth, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"
The old watchman who had seen thousands of years pass by, shook his sadly; it always happened: When the years went down to earth, with bells ringing and people singing, they went with firm determination, great ideas and plans to change things down there, but when their time was up, they were a mess.
"Yes!" sighed the watchman as he looked at the miserable 2017 standing in front of him, "it's all because of those earth people down there. They corrupt their time, they're the ones who've spoiled and tainted Two Thousand and Seventeen and all the years before!"
"What did you do on earth 2017" asked the watchman sadly
"What didn't I do" laughed the drunk year, "I started communal hatred where people lived as brothers before, I broke down churches, burnt mosques and destroyed monasteries. I drove farmers to suicide as their lands remained barren, I elected presidents who threatened to build walls and others who threatened nuclear strikes!"
"Didn't you do any good at all"
"Sure I did!" smiled the Old Year, "I showed married people the joys of divorce and drove them out of wedlock; gave children freedom with drugs and alcohol! Ha, ha, ha! You should have seen them all drunk, drugged and depraved all the time! Ha! Ha! Ha!"
The old watchman shuddered and watched the Old Year stagger and vanish into the past. And then he heard new footsteps outside the Gate of Time.
"Who goes there" he shouted.
"Two Thousand and Eighteen!" shouted an eager voice.
"Whats the password"
"Peace!"
"Welcome 2018!" shouted the watchman happily as he opened the gate and let the New Year through. He watched the New Year, a bundle of joy and happiness, love and hope, descend to Earth. "Oh you people of Earth, treat him well! Love him, respect him and what a year Two Thousand and Eighteen could be for you! It's in your hands oh people down below!"
The old watchman sighed as he hobbled back to The Gate of Time and sat down wearily to wait another year. Bob, wish your readers a Happy New Year, he whispered, Tell them, do treat 2018 well, and what a year it will be for them..!

## Title: WHITHER COALITIONS
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Tuesday, January 2, 2018 - 01:00
WHITHER COALITIONS
The word, COALITION, is derived from the Latin word coalitio which means growing together or working together. It can be further defined as a measure of peaceful co-existence between two major political parties or an alliance of several parties for an agreed political purpose. It can also be described as an alliance of parties that agree to work together during the election process and after the elections, based on the electoral results share power for the smooth operation of a government on an agreed programme.
There is another point of view regarding the formation of coalition options. According to this definition, a coalition government is a Cabinet of parliamentary government in which many or multiple political parties cooperate, reducing the dominance of any one party within that coalition. A coalition government will also come into being in a time of national crisis or in a national difficulty (for example, during war time, economic crisis or at a critical moment when there is an imminent threat to democracy). The rationale behind the formation of this type of coalition government is to provide a government of this nature, a high degree of perceived political legitimacy or collective identity it desperately needs, while also playing a strategy in diminishing internal political strife. World history has recorded repeated instances of this nature, where all party coalitions, in the form of national unity governments or grand coalitions have come up to meet different challenges.
However, according to Marxist criteria, there is a class character or a class basis for all coalitions. Class interest is the basis for all coalitions. In another definition, Marxists call it as an example of class collaboration.
The role of political and economic policies in a coalition is also debatable. When political parties are confronted for nation-wide general elections, they may use policy packages as store fronts to attract the voter base and the leaders may forget the promises or the political packages once the elections are won. A leading political scientist once said that parties formulate policies with the sole aim of winning elections, rather than win elections to formulate policies. Analyzing in broader terms, coalition politics involve a certain, well conceived commitment on the part of the main stakeholders to implement a pragmatic political programme, however much ideologically they may differ from each other.
Objective of sharing power
In the well-researched thesis, Coalition Politics and the Indian experience, Indian Political Scientist N. Jose Chander says Partners should agree on a common programme of action, the implementation of which becomes the objective of sharing power. This involves ideological compromises on the part of radical and fundamentalist parties. Sometimes rights and leftist parties come together to stall a common enemy-or it may be a coalition of secularists and communalists or even of Marxists and anti-Marxists. In either case, there must evolve a common programme for positive action. ..When like-minded parties or parties with similar ideological goals make a coalition, the making of a common programme may not have serious setbacks. Serious problem occur when ideologically polarized parties are forced to work together.
Popular opinion
Advocates of proportional representation suggest that a coalition government leads to more consensus-based politics, as a government comprising different parties (often based on different ideologies) need to compromise on various government policies. Another advantage, they point-out in their favour is that a coalition government is bound to reflect the popular opinion of the electorate in a better way, within a country in a given time.
The opponents of coalition governments believe that such governments have a tendency to be fractious and prone to disharmony, as the component parties of the government hold different beliefs and thus may not always agree on policy. Sometimes, the results of an election mean that the coalitions which are mathematically most probable are ideologically infeasible. Another difficulty might be the ability of minor parties to play a role of king maker and particularly in close elections, gain far more power in exchange for their support than the size of their vote would otherwise justify. (In the recent past, in numerous elections and coalitions governments formed thereafter, political developments of this nature has happened in Sri Lanka and India too).
Coalition governments have also been under heavy criticisms by some political thinkers for manipulating and sustaining a consensus on issues with disagreement. They hold the view that a full and lengthy discussion participated by all groups is more fruitful and beneficial in the long run, than reaching a consensus on disagreed matters. To forge a consensus, the major players of leading political groups or parties can agree to silence their disagreements on an issue to unify the coalition against the opposition. With the parliamentary majority they have in their hand, the coalition partners can collude to make the preliminary discussions on the issue irrelevant by continuously disregarding the arguments of the opposition and even voting against the opposition proposals or amendments-even if there is disagreement within the ruling parties on the issue.
Countries which often operate with coalition cabinets include-The Nordic countries, the Benelux countries, Australia, Austria, Cyprus, France, Germany, Greece, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Kosovo, Latvia, Lebanon, Nepal, New Zealand, Pakistan, Thailand, Trinidad, Tobago, Turkey, Sri Lanka and Ukraine. Switzerland, is a specific example of matured coalitions. Switzerland, has been ruled by a coalition of four strongest parties in parliament for a very long time. It is popularly known as the MAGIC FORMJULA. The United Kingdom also embarked upon a coalition government some years back-this was a coalition between the conservative and the Liberal Democrat parties. However, this was a temporary phenomena, as the UK has had single-party majority governments in recent his history. However, the present government in UK headed by Therasa May is also a minority government as it lacks a solid majority for its existence.
UNITED KINGDOM: The past history of United Kingdom reflects that various governments in power have formed coalitions in times of national crisis, in the name and style of national governments. In UK, there had been six coalition governments during the last 120 years and joint partners have been Liberal and Conservatives. The most significant coalition, was the National Government that existed between 1931 and 1940. During both world wars, multi-parties coalitions were the order of the day.
Apart from this scenario, when a single party was unable to command a majority in the House of Commons, minority governments have come into existence, with the support of one or more opposition parties agreeing to vote in favour of the legislation which governments need to function. Recent example, is the Labour Government led by James Callaghan which came to an agreement with the Liberals in 1977, when it lost the narrow majority it had gained in the October 1974 election. However, in the run up to the 1997 general election Labour leader Tony Blair had initial discussions with Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown of forming a coalition government if the labour failed to get a working majority in the House. However, the Labour won this election with an astonishing landslide and there was no reason to go for a coalition.
However, the 2010 general election resulted in a hung parliament(Britains first for 36 years) and as well-known the Conservatives led by David Cameron claiming a larger number of seats in the house, formed a unique coalition with the Liberal Democrats to seek a parliamentary majority, ending 13 years of Labour government. In the history of parliamentary government in UK, this is first time that the Conservatives and Lib Democrats reached an accord for a power-sharing deal at Westminster. It should also be stated here, that this coalition was the first full coalition in Britain since 1945, after Winston Churchills wartime coalition.
INDIA: Unlike UK and other European countries the political situation and political issues in India are basically different. This is mainly due to the nationalistic, ethnic and also regional feelings drawn in to the Indian political drama. Here, we must not forget the fact, that India is the largest democracy in the world and the Indian Constitution has also adopted the Westminster type of parliamentary structures for both the Central and State governments.
Party coalitions in India always make an attempt to expand and strengthen their base by attracting numerous parties than required for keeping themselves in power. Large-sized coalitions are a matter of attraction in the Indian political scene. The main political party in India-the Indian National Congress also is inclined to accommodate a large number of groups and interests in forming coalitions.
This is a strategy adopted by main political parties to form MAHA-COALITIONS for winning the largest number of seats for themselves and reduce the opposition to nil. At the Centre, the government should command a two-third majority to form a stable and effective organ of power-only then it will be able to go constitutional amendments if necessary. At the state level of course, even a minimum majority is enough to maintain the status-quo and make it effective. However, the present trend is to accommodate large size coalitions in states too. This is a remarkable reflection of the political culture of the Indian society.
Looking back at the Indian constitutional development, since Indias Independence on August 15, 1947, the Indian National Congress, the major political force instrumental in ending British rule and winning national Independence from the yoke of imperialism, ruled the nation for a long time. Its first Prime Minister was Jawaharlal Nehru, who fought the British Raj with Mahathma Gandhi. Second PM was Lal Bahadur Shastri and the third was Nehrus daughter, Indira Gandhi, all were from the Congress.
However, Raj Narain, who had unsuccessfully contested the general election against Indira from the constituency of Rae Bareilly in 1971, lodged a case against electoral malpractices. In June 1975, Indira was found guilty and barred by High Court from holding public office for six years. In response, an ungracious Emergency was declared under the pretext of national security.
At the next general election, Indias first ever coalition government came to the surface under the leadership of Moraji Desai. This non-congress national government existed from March 24, 1977 to July 15, 1979 headed by the Janatha Party-this was an amalgamation of political parties opposed to the Emergency, imposed between 1975 and 1977. However, as the popularity of the Janatha Party diminished, Moraji Desai had to resign and Charan Singh, a rival of Desai became the fifth Prime Minister of India. Due to lack of support, this coalition did not complete its five-year term.
Under the leadership of Indira Gandhi, Congress returned to power again in 1980 and later under Rajiv Gandhi. The 1989 election brought a coalition government under a National Front which lasted till 1991. The Congress was again lucky enough to form a stable minority government in 1991. Whatever the problems and difficulties this lasted for five years. The next 11th Parliament produced three Prime Ministers in two years and forced the country back to polls in 1998.
The Bharatiya Janatha Party (BJP) led the National Democratic Alliance into political power in 1998, under the charismatic leader Atal Bihari Vajapee and it lasted for five years, until 2004. This can be called the first successful coalition government in India. Then came another coalition, Congress led United Progressive Alliance, inhabiting 13 separate parties. Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister of this grand coalition which lasted for two terms, from 2004 to 2014.
The 16th general election held in 2014, brought the BJP back into exclusive political power as the mainstream of Indian politics, securing a majority of its own (first party to do so since 1984 election). This government continues in power very successfully and has just entered the fourth year, under the bold leadership of Narendra Modi-the uncommon man among common people.
INDONESIA: As a result of eradicating the dictatorial government of President Suharto, democratic traditions have come back to Indonesia. Mushroom of political parties and varied political groups exist in the Indonesian society. A total of 48 political parties participated in the 1999 election and thereafter 24 parties contested the election in 2004. 2009 election saw 38 parties on the political platform and again 15 parties in the 2014 election.
The existing government in Indonesia is a coalition government of seven parties led by the PDIP and Golkar.

Why India can't run much faster in 2018
Blaring titles like "Boom Shaka-laka", Wall Street forecasters are predicting that the global growth surge of 2017 will roll on next year. And they expect India to crash the party, finally.
Though it was the only major economy that didn't accelerate in 2017, thanks to its own policy mistakes, India is a consensus pick to gain speed in 2018.
That's possible. India's economy has long tended to move in sync with the rest of the world, and it fell out of step last year largely because it was tripped up by the poorly designed GST, and the unorthodox demonetisation scheme. As those selfinflicted shocks fade, India should fall back in step, but for one big caveat.
Forecasters hyping a return to the 1990s and another "Goldilocks" age of high growth and low inflation in the global economy may be too optimistic. Several key economic trends are peaking worldwide, which means that India could jump back on the global economic bandwagon just as its growth rate may be about to lose momentum.
The big change since the Goldilocks era of the 1990s is demographics. The world's capacity to generate economic growth is in good part a function of how many people are entering the workforce, and over the past decade a sharp fall in working age population growth has shaved a full point off the world's growth potential, dropping it to around 2.5%.
The global economy just had its best year in a decade, with growth accelerating past 3%. Already then, growth is running hot, well above its new, significantly reduced potential. The world economy is thus much more likely to fall back than to accelerate next year. Sustaining a growth rate above 3% was feasible in the 1990s, when more young people were entering the global workforce, but not in 2018.
A dwindling workforce also puts upward pressure on wages, which will eventually spillover into higher inflation. That didn't happen last year, but the pressure continues to build. A global unemployment rate calculated by JP Morgan since 2000 is down to 5.6%, tying its previous low. From the United States to Germany, Japan and Britain, unemployment in developed economies has fallen into single digitslows last hit in the 1990s, or earlier.
In short, with economic growth and employment peaking across the globe, growth is likely to slow in 2018 while rising wage pressure finally pushes up inflation. Central banks across the world are now acknowledging these boom-like conditions and gradually stepping back from their post-crisis easy money policies. The US Federal Reserve and the People's Bank of China are already raising interest rates and could be joined by more central banks next year. If the rest of the world starts to lose speed as a result of these tighter policies, it is less likely India's growth rate will accelerate much beyond its current pace.
Moreover, even if the world economy does not slow, India faces a second series of constraining peaks in the domestic economy. Since 2013, India has made big strides reining in past excesses. The deficit in the current account, a measure of trade and financial flows that shows how heavily a country relies on foreigners to finance its spending habits, fell from nearly 5% of GDP  a risky level  to a low of less than 1%.
The central government deficit, a symptom of the chronically spendthrift bureaucracy, came down from 5 to 3.5%. And inflation, which reflects in part weak investment and overconsumption, plummeted from double digits to below 4%.
Now, the progress on all these three key macro variables has peaked, and possibly turning for the worse. Higher prices for oil and other imports are leading to a widening of the current account deficit. Though the government expects its fiscal deficit to continue falling, there are reasons to think it won't.
GST was designed to streamline the tax system while raising revenue, but appears to be falling short on the revenue side. While the government deserves credit for bringing more discipline to public spending, there are signs that it is slipping back into populism, offering giveaways and subsidies to the beleaguered rural sector.
And the temptation to indulge in populist spending will only grow in the run-up to the national elections in early 2019.
Meanwhile, after a long period of sluggish investment growth and strong consumption growth, inflation is showing signs of turning higher. The excesses that haunted India for years, and appeared to have been beaten back, are thus poised for a comeback. The Indian bond market is already reflecting a peak in India's macroeconomic fundamentals with bond yields steadily moving higher in recent months.
That doesn't mean India is headed for a downturn; just that the country's economic picture in 2018 is unlikely to look any better than what we saw this year. As growth and employment peak worldwide, the global economy is more likely to see slower growth (with higher inflation) than to relive the "Goldilocks" conditions of the 1990s.
That will pose a headwind to India's export growth prospects, and any domestic-driven rebound is likely to come at the cost of heavier spending, higher deficits, and possibly higher inflation. It's thus hard to see how India can run much faster in 2018, and do it safely, when growth drivers are peaking on both the global and local fronts.

Reportedly, but now, the film's actress Michelle Williams has revealed that she and other actors re-filmed their scenes in the movie for free.

"I hated that this man's time and expertise and gentlemanly-ness was going to be kind of for naught, so when I got the phone call about the change of plans I was thrilled. They could have my salary, they could have my holiday, whatever they wanted. Because I appreciated so much that they were making this massive effort," explained Williams.
