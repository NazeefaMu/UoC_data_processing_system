All Blacks hooker Taylor commits to long-term deal
Wellington: Codie Taylor has become the first All Black to sign a long-term contract to remain with New Zealand rugby through to 2021, and confirmed Friday he wants to play in three World Cups.
The 26-year-old hooker, who is currently in South Africa with the Canterbury Crusaders preparing for the Super Rugby final against the Golden Lions on Saturday, said he had no desire to take up an overseas contract.
"I feel like I am living the dream at the moment, raising my young family here in New Zealand and playing for these teams that I love, so recommitting through to 2021 just makes sense for me," said Taylor who recently became a father for the first time.
Taylor, who started all three Tests in the recent British and Irish Lions series while Dane Coles was sidelined with concussion symptoms, played one match in the 2015 World Cup against Namibia.
He told Fairfax media from Johannesburg he was targeting the 2019 World Cup in Japan and "thinking in the future I won't be too old for the next World Cup either. So, who knows what can happen next."
All Blacks coach Steve Hansen described Taylor, a great-great-grandson of 1893 All Black Walter Pringle, as an "outstanding" hooker who has "the skill-set and temperament to play at a world-class level".
While he is the first All Black to commit through to 2021, Sam Whitelock, Ben Smith and Anton Lienert-Brown are signed through to 2020.
Another 16 All Blacks have inked deals through to 2019 including captain Kieran Read, Owen Franks, Israel Dagg, Brodie Retallick, Aaron Smith, Dane Coles, Beauden Barrett and Sonny Bill Williams and Joe Moody. AFP

Anderson ousts top-seed Thiem as Nishikori advances
Washington: South Africa's Kevin Anderson upset top seed Dominic Thiem while Japanese second seed Kei Nishikori won a battle of past champions Thursday to advance at the ATP Citi Open.
Anderson endured a three-hour rain delay and saved a match point before firing his 21st ace to finish off seventh-ranked Thiem 6-3, 6-7 (6/8), 7-6 (9/7) after two hours and 46 minutes and reach the Washington hardcourt quarter-finals.
"He broke me a couple of times in the third set and I made a couple big serves," said Anderson. "I did a great job of making first serves and I was able to come back."
Thiem, in his first hardcourt tuneup for the US Open, fell to 0-6 lifetime against Anderson, all on hardcourts, but managed to swipe a set from his 45th-ranked nemesis for only the second time in his career.
"I don't like to play big servers in general. What can I do The draw was not great with him in the second round," Thiem said. "It's one of those bad losses. It can't go my way all the time. It isn't easy to make this change (to hardcourt) after a long break."
Nishikori, the 2015 Washington winner, beat three-time champion Juan Martin Del Potro 6-4, 7-5, for only his second victory in seven matches against the Argentine 13th seed.
"We both missed a little bit in the first set, but second set, I played great," said Nishikori. "Especially I was returning well."
It was the second early morning finish in as many matches for Nishikori, who faces US wildcard Tommy Paul next.
"It's a bit crazy," Nishikori said of the schedule. "It's not easy to recover well. It's a late match tomorrow so I'll be ready." Paul, who has never faced Nishikori, has ousted seventh seed Lucas Pouille and 11th seed Gilles Muller. "He's playing pretty well," Nishikori said. "He has a great serve and big forehand."
Russia's Daniil Medvedev upset Bulgarian fourth seed Grigor Dimitrov 6-4, 6-2, to reach a last-match matchup with Germany's eighth-ranked Alexander Zverev, who beat American Tennys Sandgren 7-5, 7-5 just before 2 a.m. after killing time with a nap and video games.
"It didn't feel as long as it actually was," Zverev said.
Anderson saved a match point when Thiem netted a backhand to level the last tie-breaker at 6-6, then hit a forehand winner to set up a match point that Thiem erased with a service winner. But Thiem sent a backhand wide on the penultimate point and Anderson blasted an ace wide to reach his fourth Washington quarter-final, matching his best result. "It was a pretty good match overall. I'm satisfied with my game," Thiem said. "I didn't feel that great on my serve. I had some problems with my percentage. I just didn't get the feel of the serve."
After an early exchange of third-set breaks, Anderson double faulted on a break point to hand Thiem a 4-3 edge. But Thiem was broken in the 10th game while serving for the match. "If you break Anderson twice in one set, you have to win it," Thiem said. "If I would have served batter I could have saved it in the third set."
Next up for Anderson is 200th-ranked Indian qualifier Yuki Bhambri, who eliminated Argentina's 100th-ranked Guido Pella 6-7 (5/7), 6-3, 6-1. "Hopefully I can win a few more matches here," Bhambri said. "I'd like to break back into the top 100 by the end of the year and play as many big events as possible."
Anderson has never shared a court with Bhambri except in workouts. AFP

## Title: Are Sri Lanka and India playing on two different surfaces

Are Sri Lanka and India playing on two different surfaces
It seems like Sri Lanka and India are playing on two different types of pitches at the SSC - venue of the second cricket Test of the series.
Whereas the Lankan bowlers struggled to gain purchase off the second day pitch toiling for the best part of 68 overs to capture six Indian wickets for 278 runs, it was a totally different story when the Indian bowlers came on.
India for the second successive occasion topped 600 runs batting first and scoring 622-9 declared. It was the 29th time in Test cricket they had topped that figure with only Australia ahead with 32.
By the close Sri Lanka who are already 1-0 down in the three-match series was struggling at 50 for two wickets, trailing by 572. Two of their most exciting batters are in the middle Kusal Mendis on 16 and Dinesh Chandimal on eight. A lot will depend on this pair if Sri Lanka is to make any headway towards getting past the follow-on mark which is 423.
When the Indian spinners came on to bowl the ball started to spit, bite and bounce to a degree that made batting out in the middle suddenly uneasy.
Upul Tharanga was unlucky for the second time in a Test. On this occasion he played Ashwin off his legs straight to short leg fielder Rahuls midriff. At Galle he was run out with his bat in the air.
Dimuth Karunaratne went edging a catch to first slip for 25 to give Ashwin who opened the bowling with Mohammad Shami his second wicket of the innings. Ashwin had earlier taken his career aggregate past 2000 Test runs when he scored a useful 54 and with 200plus Test wickets is turning out to be a more than useful all-rounder for India.
When India resumed at 344-3, Sri Lanka dismissed both overnight batsmen within the first 83 minutes  Cheteswaran Pujara adding only five to his overnight score of 128 and Ajinkya Rahane 29 to his 103. Their dismissals in the first session presented part time seamer Dimuth Karunaratne and debutant Malinda Pushpakumara with their maiden Test wickets.
Pushpakumara toiled 22.1 overs for his first wicket conceding 91 runs, but Karunaratne who made the first break through for his team in the morning did not have to wait that long winning a confident lbw decision against Pujara off the first over he bowled yesterday.
If Sri Lanka thought they were through to the Indian late order and tail they had another big surprise in store for the lower order proved more than a handful. Ashwin, wicket-keeper Saha and Jadeja all made half-centuries as India grounded the Lankan bowling to the dust.
It was frustrating having gone into the match with just one fast bowler Nuwan Pradeep and having lost his services for the match after he pulled his left hamstring on the first day, Sri Lanka were down to just three spinners who had to bear the brunt of the bowling as the Indian batters really capitalised on the shortcoming to pile on the runs.
Herath bowled 42 overs for four wickets, Dilruwan Perera 40 overs for one wicket and Pushpakumara 38.2 overs for two wickets  the three of them conceded 457 of the total number of runs scored by India.
It was tough ask for Sri Lanka who in this series has a habit of losing players through injuries which places an extra burden on the rest of the team members and also hinders their game plans for the match. At Galle they were minus Asela Gunaratne and Herath and here Pradeep is doubtful for the rest of the match.
Everything depends on the amount of runs Sri Lanka can put on the board in the first innings while the pitch is still playing well. It is slow but not impossible to bat. The longer the batsman spends time in the middle the more chances he has of getting a big score. One has only to look at how the Indian batters built their innings with six of them getting past fifty. The difference between the two sides is that unlike the Lankan bowlers who were not consistent with their lines and lengths the Indians are not going to give any easy runs because they know which channels to bowl.

Army chief says no mercy for murderers in military
New army chief Lt.Gen Mahesh Senanayake yesterday vowed he will not protect any murderers in the military trying to take the cover of war heroes to avoid prosecution.
In the clearest distinction between war heroes and murderes, the army chief said he will not allow criminal elements taking the cover of war heroes to tanish the image of the security forces.
During the war, or thereafter, if anyone has used the military uniform and committed any offence, he is not a war hero. It is such people who claim that war heroes are being hounded.
Those who fought the war will not be punished. Not a single soldier who fought bravely has been punished, nor will they be allowed to be penalised because we have not committed any offences, he said.
The army chief was speaking to reporters after worshipping at the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy and calling on the chief priests of the two main chapters there.
Even if I have done something wrong, I must be punished. I want to say, there is a difference between mini maruwa (murderer) and rana viruwa (war hero). The people should know the difference, especially the military.
If a rana viruwa has become a mini maruwa, he must be punished, he stressed.Army Chief Senanayake made it clear that security personnel had no special immunity.
We are subject to both the penal code and the military law, he said. Therefore we have to be a highly disciplined force. (Economynext)

Bolt to make world bow in career swansong
London: Usain Bolt kicks off the defence of his world 100m on Friday in his swansong season, the first step to bringing down the curtain on his glittering career.
Bolt, dubbed an "extraordinary competitor" by IAAF president Sebastian Coe, will take to the track in London as favourite for the blue riband event, having won eight individual finals at the past four worlds as well as in four 4x100m relay finals.
The 30-year-old Jamaican has only suffered one hiccup: when he false started in the 100m final in Daegu in 2011.
"That's not going to happen this time," joked Bolt, who also has eight Olympic golds to his name.
"If I show up at a championships I'm fully confident."
Coe heaped praise on the Jamaican on Thursday, but said he remained optimistic for track and field in the post-Bolt era.
"You won't be particularly surprised when I say I'm sad he's going," said Coe, who won two Olympic 1500m gold medals for Britain.
"I'm an athletics fan, I take my federation hat off, the guy has been a sensation.
"He's connected in a way that few, in or out of their sport, have connected. I can't think of someone who's connected that way really since Muhammad Ali."
Coe added: "There's no conjecture, he's the best sprinter of all time, the record books show that.
"But what we're going to miss is not so much the fact that it's unlikely for the forseeable future that someone's going to win three Olympic titles in a row in the 100 and 200, relay, or a sackful of world medals, or world records, it's just that the guy has a personality.
"When we're sitting here with the slightly pre-packaged sports stars that have to look left or right to be able to answer a question most of the time and are nervous, he has a view, he has an opinion and that's what we'll miss." Coe also tried to relativise the absence of Bolt from the world of athletics.
"If we'd be sitting here 15, 16 years ago we'd probably be having the same discussions about the imminent retirement of Michael Johnson or Marie-Jose Perec," the Briton said.
"Athletes came through. Muhammad Ali retired, great boxers came through. You didn't replace Ali but the sport didn't suddenly die so I'm very optimistic about the sport.
"He's committed to staying and helping us engage in all those areas and those discussions will take place once these championships are out the way."
Another potential star of the world champs will be on show Friday: Mo Farah will be aiming for a 10th consecutive global title when he races the sole final of the night, the 10,000m.
The 34-year-old Somalia-born Briton, who will switch his focus to road running at the season's end, has shunned media in the run up to the worlds in a bid to avoid tricky questions about his coach Alberto Salazar and doping claims, since proved to be false.
Friday's session also features qualifying in the men's discus throw and long jump, and women's pole vault and 1500m. AFP

## Title: A boost for investment
## Supertitle:

A boost for investment
Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) are essential for any developing country to strengthen the economy and create jobs. Sri Lanka, which liberalized its economy exactly 40 years ago, is known as a premier investment destination in South Asia. However, various factors including volatile global economic conditions can sometimes hamper the FDI inflow to developing countries.
There is intense competition for FDI among developing nations. This is why Sri Lanka must offer the right projects and the right investment climate for foreign investors. In other words, our product must be unique and different.
Sri Lanka now has a great opportunity to reinvigorate its FDI prospects thanks to a slew of foreign investment projects led by the US$ 1.1 billion Hambantota Port agreement with a Chinese company. According to Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, the Hambantota Port project alone will generate around US$ 400 million in investments in the next few months.
International ratings agency Moodys has said the port deal was credit-positive for Sri Lanka and could help the island reduce its debt servicing and build foreign reserves. The Port deal has generated a lot of interest in Sri Lankas investment potential. Moreover, US$ 388 million has flowed into Government Securities and another US$ 246 million to the Colombo Stock Exchange. The International Sovereign Bond floated in March was seven times oversubscribed.
As the Governor rightly points out, Sri Lanka needs enhanced investments for economic growth and there are no short cuts for that. Sri Lanka should create an investor-friendly climate and build investor confidence, stresses the Governor. It is also vital for the domestic private sector to be more robust for growth to pick up.
There are a few other recently announced high-profile projects and business concerns which are ideal candidates for FDI. Among them are the planned divestiture of 51 per cent of Hotel Developers Lanka (Owner of Colombo Hilton property in Colombo Fort) and all of Canwill Holdings (Pvt) Limited (owner of 49-storey Grand Hyatt property in Kollupitiya) currently valued at US$ 240 million. Talks are also reported to be underway on finding a strategic partner for the loss-making SriLankan Airlines, with at least two well-known airlines in the fray.
Creating a climate conducive to investments is very important. The Board of Investment (BoI) was established with this aim in mind, but even the BoI has not been able to totally eliminate the copious amount of red tape involved. Some investors, driven from pillar to post, have left the country and taken their investments to countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh. This aspect should be addressed and investors should get a seamless experience from the time they come in with the proposal to the opening of their FDI project(s).
There was one other hidden factor that had driven investors away  corruption. Many foreign investment projects launched during the previous Governments tenure were grossly overestimated, with the additional amount reflecting the corruption element. There should be no room for corruption at any level in the approval process for FDI.
Foreign Investment should not be considered as a panacea for all ills. Sometimes all we need to have are better managed enterprises, public or private. There is no debate that certain loss-making and debt-ridden state-owned enterprises should be restructured and streamlined to serve the public in a better way.
Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) are also an ideal solution. The Government is keen to explore PPPs in transport, utilities, ports, tourism, construction, housing, health care, financial services, information technology and mining and minerals sector. Former BoI veteran Thilan Wijesinghe has been appointed to spearhead the PPPs which will not involve privatization at any stage.
Projects in the pipeline include the elevated highway from the new Kelani Bridge to Athurugiriya, the underground road to extend Marine Drive connecting with the port access road, inland water-based transport and inland air transport, light rail transit, utility projects in water, waste to energy, and industrial zones. These are massive projects that the State alone cannot handle which require a huge quantum of funds and PPPs are a viable option.
Sri Lanka should seek more foreign investments in the power and energy sector, given the imperative need to phase out thermal power and rely more on renewable energy. Fossil fuels, with the exception of coal, are generally expected to run out in the next 100 years. In this backdrop, several alternative energy projects have already been announced by the Government. Concessions and incentives should be granted to local and foreign investors who seek to implement wind, solar and even ocean wave energy projects. This will help reduce the massive fuel import bill which exceeds US$ 6 billion a year.
There was a downward trend in global FDI last year to US$ 1.52 trillion, but an improved economic outlook this year could help turn things around and boost global FDIs to US$ 1.8 trillion, according to the latest UNCTAD reports. Sri Lanka must position itself as a gateway to South Asia and indeed, Asia itself to secure a bigger slice of this global investment pie.

CRICKET SAVED MOEEN ALI FROM THE STREETS
Hows it going Moeen Ali asks as if its just another ordinary summer afternoon rather than an hour since he became only the fourth man in history to complete a Test victory by taking a hat-trick.
Moeens deceptively casual way of answering my phone call at The Oval on Monday afternoon soon gives way to delight when, 12 days since we met in Birmingham, he returns to the reflective tone of that first interview.
Oh, its such a great feeling, Moeen says amid the thrill of his feat against South Africa. I never came close to a hat-trick before  not even at Moseley Ashfield [his junior club in Birmingham]. So I cant wait to get home this evening to see everyone. It will be a happy night but Ill celebrate with the boys here first and have a couple of Cokes.
Moeen Ali
Moeen laughs as we remember him discussing the temptations of his youth, before he discovered Islam, but he becomes thoughtful again when I ask if his father has been at The Oval. Unfortunately he couldnt be here today but Im sure he watched every ball. Him and my mum just messaged me. They sounded so happy and proud  just like me. It feels like Ive come so far. Like I said to you last time, it now feels like every day of my life in cricket is such a bonus.
That afternoon in Birmingham seems even more resonant now, especially when I listen again to our first interview.
Ive not been here for years, Moeen says as his voice echoes softly around Moseley Ashfields empty clubhouse 12 days earlier. Its incredible. Nothings changed.
Moeens magnificently bearded face breaks into a smile as we approach some old Moseley photographs on the wall. There I am, he says, pointing at his 13-year-old self, a boy whose shy pride shines out of his smooth face. Moeen taps a team-mate behind the glass. Hes still my best mate and theres my younger brother, and I met this guy in Asda not long ago. I dont think he plays cricket now.
The troubles of the world recede  as does Englands unpredictable series against South Africa, in which a crushing defeat in the second Test was followed by their 239-run win at The Oval. Moeen is also more intrigued by the past at Moseley Ashfield than his starring role in Englands equally convincing victory in the first Test at Lords, where he was outstanding with bat and ball and passed 2,000 runs and 100 wickets in the Test arena. The fourth and final Test begins on Friday at Old Trafford but he gazes at a scorecard from a Moseley under-15 game in June 2001.
I remember it very well, Moeen says of a 20-over match in which he hit an unbeaten 195. The next highest score was 11 in Moseleys total of 236. I actually started slowly. Look at the opening four overs. I didnt score many as I was nervous.
Moeen is back in more innocent days, remembering a time three months before the world changed forever on 9/11. Terror attacks on great cities across the globe were still rare and Islamophobia had yet to spread with casual vehemence but, coming from a poor Asian family in Birmingham, there were dangers for Moeen as a boy.
If it wasnt for cricket I dont know what Id be doing now, he says. I could have easily gone into that whole drugs line. I was pretty open to it because my friends were easily influenced. I get dared pretty easy. If someone dares me to do something Ill just do it. I used to go: Yeah, why not
Moeen, who is now a dedicated Muslim, adds: Them days were tough but even then I knew that was wrong. I also knew from the age of 12 that cricket was the only thing I was going to do. I thought: If its not good for my cricket Im not doing anything. But theres a group of guys who are the coolest in the school and you want to be part of that. You feel you have to do things you wouldnt normally do but most of the time I was pretty normal.
He stresses how much his father suffered long before Moeen was born. Racism could be so distressing in Birmingham in the 1970s that his dad, Minar, succumbed to a stammer that still troubles him. It was much harder for my dad and his brother. They are twins and they went through a lot. They both stammered  and still do. My dad is not as bad as his twin and he speaks more now but the hardship continued. My dad had to give up his job as a psychiatric nurse. He got caught sleeping because he was exhausted. Even to this day he said he gave up the job but I think they got rid of him. He also suffered a minor stroke when I was about 13.
Cricket became a refuge for the extended family  as his brothers and cousins have all played county or minor counties cricket. It took a lot of sacrifice from my dad. He managed to put cricket nets in our garden because he knew we had to practise every day. That would also keep us away from the streets.
My dad and uncle were so protective so whenever someone would say or do something to harm us they were right there. They were very shy but you cross a line with them and the temper can get quite rough. There was an incident where a guy nearly killed me on this road. I was 14 and he wanted to hurt me.
Moeen opens his eyes wide at the memory of a car driving into him on purpose just a short walk from we now sit. He was an Asian guy so it wasnt racist  unless he thought I was a white kid because I used to be very fair. But to this day I dont know why he did that. My dad was angry but thankfully some firemen stopped everything.
If his father had not supported him so staunchly its unlikely Moeen would have played 40 Tests for England. And so he laments the loss of many of his Asian contemporaries who did not receive the same parental help. At that time, because it wasnt seen as a career by Asians, they would just drop their kid off and go home. Whereas my dad would watch us, support us as much as he could. He helped us live and breathe the game. One of my best friends was a very talented all-rounder but the difference was that my parents pushed me a lot more.
Now, a lot more south Asian people are thinking: Actually, I could make a good career from this now. But its also down to the counties to do more to help South-Asian kids. Look at Warwickshire. This is a big city of Asian people, so why cant you produce any south Asian players I dont understand. Either the coaching system is not great or they just dont know how to tap into it or theyve not tried. The counties should take more responsibility.
What does Moeen think of the ECBs new south Asian initiative  where the governing body is, through workshops and proactive schemes, engaging with these local communities Its a very good step in the right direction to ask people how the ECB can help them. Its very positive because the pool of talent is vast. But the south Asian mentality must also change. Cricket is not just batting and bowling. Theres a lot of physical stuff, fitness, fielding, diet, discipline, being on time. A lot of talented south Asians have been county players but theyre always late. The ECB scheme is good but the players must be ready to sacrifice.
If cricket saved Moeen from the streets, it can now help disaffected young Muslims feel less alienated. It can also, as the ECB initiative strives to do, unite communities. I think it can, Moeen says. There is such negativity in the media around Islam but when I play cricket for England I dont have to say anything. Im hoping people look at me and other Muslims and think: Actually, it will be all right. Theyre not too bad.
Does Moeen still suffer abuse as a Muslim Im not a massive reader of online comments but I come across the odd comment where people still question if Im English. I find that so silly.
Moeens face scrunches up but his soft Brummie accent rings out. Theres still work to be done.
Has he felt increased Islamophobia in the wake of attacks in Westminster, Manchester and outside the Finsbury Park mosque Oh yeah. 100%. As soon as its a Muslim guy its always: Terrorist this, terrorist that. And if its not a Muslim guy its: Oh, hes mentally ill. Hes a lone wolf. But the more they try and knock us down the more united well be as a country. As Muslims well start opening up a bit more.
Moeen nods enthusiastically when I mention the composure and restraint of Mohammed Mahmoud the Finsbury Park imam. People wanted to beat the guy up who did the attack. The imam stopped them from using violence and thats exactly what Islam is about. It was great something positive came out of it.
Does he feel disillusioned by Islamophobia in this country and the corrosive presidency of Donald Trump I knew Trump would win so it was no surprise. Im big on thinking its already been decreed. Its Gods will. We will overcome all the problems eventually.
But how does he feel when Trump seeks to ban travellers from certain Muslim countries Yeah, that is tough. It was always going to be tough once he got in but you just keep going and look at the positives. I know its easy for me to say that, as a cricketer, when people are going through a lot more. But my own test will come.
Moeen faced a small ordeal three years ago when, in his fifth Test, against India at the Rose Bowl, he caused controversy on the second day by wearing wristbands which read Save Gaza and Free Palestine. It was humanitarian. Im actually glad it happened even if I was a bit naive putting them on during the game. But its still very close to me. People are quiet but theres still suffering in Gaza now.
There is suffering in many Muslim and non-Muslim countries. We spend billions going into space and we cant even look after people. I find that hard to accept. Weve let each other down big time regardless of our colour, faith or community. We should help people without a political agenda. It should be done out of compassion, without hesitation. I find that [lack of compassion] the hardest thing to take these days.
We have spoken for 40 minutes before returning to the Test series. If nothing else the ups and downs should keep both teams as grounded and humble as Moeen.
There are probably more downs than ups in life and cricket. You try to stay level-headed and cricket has taught me so much. I used to be really shy, and still am, but I can stand up in front of people now and talk. I wouldnt say I was great at it but Im out of my shell because of cricket. People assume I would be quiet and serious but in the changing room I like to crack a few jokes.
For all his concern about the wider world, Moeen is rightly proud of his achievements. The Lords Test felt like I was rewarded after 30-odd games for England. People forget its not easy playing for England. We lost the second Test and there was a lot of scrutiny.
Moeen is so versatile he gets shunted up and down the order  and was back to No8 despite his batting average of 48 over the last 18 months. He also gets called a second spinner even when he is clearly the best slow bowler in Englands Test squad.
Its difficult but when I get the ball I just want to get a wicket. As a batter I just want to play my shots. I dont want to look back one day and regret anything.
wWith the whole second spinner thing, I like having two spinners. But its difficult because Ive obviously played more than the guys coming in. Ive got more wickets. Even though Im a senior spinner I dont think Im a great spinner but Im not bad either.
When his cricket career ends Moeen would be content cleaning the toilets in his local mosque. Id love to do something like that. Im not trying to be humble  it is genuinely something I would enjoy as Id spend time in the mosque.
In the meantime Moeen and his wife have finally bought their own home. It was only last year we moved out from my parents house. It was tough but it was the right thing. Were only around the corner anyway.
It was timely as, six weeks ago, Moeen turned 30. He laughs in disbelief. I thought: Now Im getting old. There will be a day when Im not going to be breathing. I know its quite deep thinking but it was like, from now on, you have to savour each moment. Id like to play as long as I can but Im already happy with how much Ive done for England. Everything that follows is a bonus.
He looks around the small clubhouse where he grew to love cricket  the game which helped a young boy find himself. He looks at home. Yeah, its good here, he says, quietly. Its got a special feeling. At The Oval that special feeling is enhanced. Not bad for a second spinner, I joke as Moeen is now the leading wicket-taker in the series with 18  four more than any other bowler.
Yeah, not too bad at all, Moeen chuckles. The strange thing is that, apart from those three balls, I didnt bowl that well. But I worked hard and it paid off. Im more chuffed that we won the game and are 2-1 up in the series.
Beyond mere sport, however, such a magical afternoon will surely help erode the lingering suspicion of some people who still doubt Englands Muslim cricketers. Moeens answer, is emphatic. 100%, he says, his gentle voice ringing with the conviction of a man who has done more than just seal a Test match with a hat-trick.  The Guardian

Davis Cup: Proposal to reduce matches to best-of-three sets
Davis Cup singles matches will continue to be played over the best-of-five sets after a proposal to reduce them to best-of-three failed to gain approval.
The proposal was backed by 63.54% of voters at the International Tennis Federation (ITF) AGM, just short of the required two-thirds majority.
World number one Andy Murray has called for matches to be shortened to increase the participation of top players.
ITF president David Haggerty said the vote result was "disappointing".
He added: "Change is needed to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions."
A motion was approved guaranteeing both the Davis Cup and women's Fed Cup finalists the choice of hosting their first-round ties the following year. BBC

## Title: Dawn of a new promise for Hambantota

Dawn of a new promise for Hambantota
Hambantota continues to be the important and wider focus of politics this week, despite the push by the story on questions about Minister Ravi Karunanayakes penthouse residence in Colombo, which has certainly grabbed the media interest, due to the material that links it to the Central Bank Bond scam and the related issues of corruption, that continue to trail the present government.
The Joint Opposition (JO) has already given a No Confidence motion in Parliament on Minister Karunanayake. However, the matter remains before the Presidential Commission on the Bond Scams, and any action by government will require the findings of the Commission.
The JO and associated social-political forces are seeking to build a campaign against the government on an alleged sale of the Hambantota Port or the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port to give its official name, to the Chinese, on what is a 99 year lease  with several provisions in the lease agreement that ensures Sri Lanka obtaining rights over the port and its facilities at various stages of the lease period.
What is evident is that the JO, and the Rajapaksa clan that leads it, have realized that the lease of the Hambantota Port to the Chinese, and the development of the Port that will begin very soon, together with the Chinese business activity in the peripheral zone, will bring about a major change to the economic activity in the Hambantota District. The Rajapaksas were unable to bring about this, despite the huge projects it brought to Hambantota at considerable cost to the county, and not without financial advantages to those associated with these projects.
Much of the Rajapaksa years of government from 2005 till 2014 saw strategies to show that Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family  the son, brothers and niece in Parliament and the Defence Secretary, were having a special campaign to develop the South of Sri Lanka, and particularly the Hambantota District that is the Deep South, to make it possibly the best developed region in the country.
It is true that Hambantota remained a very poorly developed district in the country. The efforts by the late DM Rajapaksa to bring both political and economic development to the region in the 1930s failed, with his early demise. He was the person who brought the brown or kurakkan coloured sataka to the political apparel of the time, which Mahinda Rajapaksa transferred to red and made it his own symbol of pro-people politics. But, the Hambantota Port, the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Cricket Stadium  better known as the Sooriyawewa Stadium, and other lesser known projects, did little to improve the economy of the region and living conditions of the people. The huge sums paid for these key projects remained a burden on the national economy.
The Mattala International Airport, that also carried the Mahinda Rajapaksa name, too was built by China at US $ 4.8 billion, mostly from soft loans obtained during the Rajapaksa Regime. The disastrous economic situation of this airport is best described by what it is known by the world aviation industry- the Worlds Emptiest International Airport. The Sooriyawewa Stadium also did little to promote sports or help the Hambantota people by way of employment. In fact, it had been closed down and neglected until there was a sudden move by Sri Lanka Cricket to renovate it for a recent cricket series.
With all the expenditure on the Rajapaksa Projects costing many billions of US dollars, to be paid up by the Sri Lankan economy and people, Hambantota was steadily transformed into an area of economic disaster in this country, with huge empty promises of emergent development mainly with Chinese funded projects. Hambantota possibly owed much more to the world than any other district in the rural areas of Sri Lanka. Had Mahinda Rajapaksa won the January 2015 Presidential Poll, Hambantota would inevitably have had to raise much more funds, again from the Chinese, who remained very close to Mahinda Rajapaksa and his regime.
The situation in the district, the Southern Province and the county would have been much worse than today, and without the relief that has been brought by the Lease of the Hambantota Port, yes to the Chinese  the original builders who had the plans, the funds, the know-how and the interest to develop this port from the largely idling location it was till now, to a fully functioning international harbour.
Benefits known
The benefits of a port at Hambantota were known to economic planners and shipping interests in Sri Lanka for several decades. Several studies have been done to assess the value of a new port at Hambantota, considering the increased shipping in this region over the past few decades, and especially with the rise in importance of the Ports of Dubai and Singapore. Hambantota was certainly a much looked forward to location for fuelling and supply of victuals to the increasing numbers, in their hundreds, of vessels sailing in this part of the Indian Ocean, where Sri Lanka is strategically located. Apart from bringing glory to the Rajapaksa name, this growing need for a good port at Hambantota would have made Mahinda Rajapaksa look at this project. But, the hurries of political advantage certainly went against making it a fully functional port with the necessary bunkering and other essential facilities, when it was ceremonially opened.
It is also necessary, in the context of international relations, to ensure that India, the closest neighbour of Sri Lanka is in no way given cause to be worried about the Chinese shipping and port activities in Hambantota. The Foreign Policy of Sri Lanka and the Policy of Good Neighbourly Relations should make sure that while China attends to the development and good, profitable functioning of the Hambantota Port, there will be no cause whatever, for concerns by India. The requirement in the lease with China that all security activities in the Hambantota Port will be handled by Sri Lanka is important in this context. There is also the decision to ensure that no foreign naval vessels will be allowed to this port and its facilities, with India having raised concerns about such vessels in Sri Lankan ports earlier.
The lease of the Hambantota Port to China has certainly brought much international attention to Sri Lanka. The story is well focused by all international news agencies and, especially by the institutions related to investment and economic relations. There has been a welcome reaction by the international marketplace to the new development, and the promises it holds for the future. This is reflected in the Moodys Credit Positive image for Sri Lanka due to the port lease. This is what Moodys said, as reported in Lanka Business Online (LBO) on August 01, 2017. Quote: The Hambantota port deal is credit positive for Sri Lanka because it will boost foreign-exchange reserves, which will ease the governments external liquidity position ahead of several large international bond payments in 2019-22.
Earnings from the Hambantota Port stake sale will feed into the Central Banks foreign-exchange reserves, which will help bolster investor confidence and encourage future portfolio inflows, Moodys said.
Importantly, the sale will allow the government to set aside earnings to repay its upcoming debt maturities and reduce its external debt, a key constraint on Sri Lankas credit quality. External debt maturities in 2019-22 total $13.8 billion. Unquote
In the context of the international interest on the Hambantota Port Lease, Forbes  Markets # Foreign Affairs, has given this opinion by Panos Mourdoukoutas on August 01, 2017.
China's Hambantota deal is bad news for both Pakistan and India
The taking over of Hambantota by Beijing is bad news for both Pakistan and India -- for different reasons.
For Pakistan, the deal will serve as a model for the future of CPEC (ChinaPakistan Economic Corridor), a huge transportation network connecting China to the Arabian Sea at Pakistans Gwadar Port. Like Hambantota, CPEC started with loans that will eventually be converted into equity, as it seems very unlikely Pakistan will ever be in a position to pay them back. This means that Beijing will one day own CPEC, and collect tolls from every vehicle that makes use of it.
For New Delhi, the Hambantota deal is bad news because its one more step to encircle and pacify India by Beijing. Chinas enormous investment in CPEC, and port infrastructure in the Indian Ocean, serves much more than trade. It advances Beijings String of Pearls strategy, as well as its unofficial agenda to encircle India through its arch-rival, Pakistan.
To be fair, the Hambantota port will make it easier for India to trade with Sri Lanka. But it could also be used as a naval station for China should the two countries ever engage in a full-scale war.
These are certainly issues of importance that Sri Lankas political leaders and policy makers would have to always bear in mind with the progress of the One Belt  One Road Policy of China, and Indias own development and defence strategies in the region.

Drought-hit farmers face elephant threats
Farmer organization representatives complain that farmers in difficulty due the prevailing drought have to face threats from wild elephants who invade villages in search of food and water.
Farmers in Kahatagollewa and Ihala Puliyankulama in Kebithigollewa DS Division had complained to President Maithripala Sirisena as well when he toured the area recently. They had told him that the electrified fences recommended to be constructed in their villages are not erected yet.
The setting up of an electrified fence of about 850 km covering 22 Divisional Secretaries in Anuradhapura had been stalled. Proposals submitted to the Anuradhapura government agent have been forwarded to wildlife conservation authorities for further action.
When inquired from wildlife officials, they said that a majority of proposals by Divisional Secretaries on electrified fences were lacking vital information. Also, the proposed tracks for fences were either blocking elephant corridors or the distance is extravagant. Under these circumstances, the proposals are to be revised which takes time, they pointed out.
Anuradhapura government agent R. M. Wanninayaka said on the directions of the President, he would discuss with Divisional Secretaries and wildlife conservation officials immediately to implement the electric fence project on a priority basis.

Families seek information about disappeared people from HRC
Since Sri Lankas new right-to-information law went into effect in February, a significant amount of the requests directed to the countrys Human Rights Commission (HRC) are from people looking for information about family members who had forcibly disappeared.
Data produced from an RTI request filed by the Daily News shows that of the 28 requests the commission has received so far, 12 pertained to information about missing or disappeared people.
Thats just over 40 percent of all the requests they received.
Im not surprised at all, said Kumaravadivel Guruparan, a law professor at the University of Jaffna who specializes in human rights. These families are desperately looking for their sons and daughters and husbands and wives.
Amnesty International estimates that there have been between 60,000 and 100,000 cases of enforced disappearances in Sri Lanka since the 1980s.
The majority were of young Sinhalese killed or kidnapped because of suspected leftist links in the late 1980s, or Tamils taken for alleged association with the LTTE from 1983 to 2009.
Guruparan said the RTI law may be a new avenue for people to get information about the whereabouts and fate of their lost family members.
But it all depends on if the national security exemption is being used to deny information, he said, referencing a part of the law that lets agencies withhold information if they determine its release would undermine the defence of the State or its territorial integrity or national security.
If these authorities are serious about providing and not hiding, I think the RTI can be a way to answer (these families) queries, he said.
The Human Rights Commission has not rejected any of the requests pertaining to information about disappeared people, according to its RTI disclosure.
The Daily News is in the process of submitting RTI requests to see if other agencies are denying people information about enforced disappearances for national security reasons.
For its part, the Human Rights Commission closely followed the terms of the RTI law in complying with the request from the Daily News.
The commission confirmed the receipt of the request, and provided the information within the 14-day window outlined in the law. That is not always the case with government agencies since the roll-out of the law, as has been reported in this paper and in other media outlets.
The spokesman for the Human Rights Commission could not be reached by press time.
Last month, the government took a step toward addressing the questions of the families of the disappeared.
President Maithripala Sirisena signed an act forming an Office of Missing Persons, which would serve as a primary means for families to get information about disappeared loved ones. To date, it remains unformed.

GMOA appreciates PMs stance
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is honestly trying to legalise the Minimum Standards of Medical Education while Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne is trying his best to stop it, Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that the Prime Minister has appointed MP Tilak Marapana to oversea the Attorney Generals Department. The GMOA appreciates this action very much.
The Attorney Generals Department had informed the Health Ministry that the minimum standards of medical education cannot be gazetted. The letter had sent by the same official from the department who mislead the judiciary during Court of Appeal case.
We request the Prime Minister to call for an immediate meeting of all relevant parties to discuss the minimum standards of medical education. According to the Health Ministers recent speeches, the standards should be gazetted on or before August 14, he said.
But, it will only be a dream because he does everything possible to prevent gazetting minimum standards in order to prevent exposing the low standard of SAITM and bring in another five SITM type fraudulent institutions, Dr. Aluthge said.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said that the current Health Minister prevented the gazette containing minimum standards of medical education passed in Parliament as an Opposition MP and the relevant Hanzard records will be released to the public soon. If the minimum standards of medical education are there, no one including the Health Minister cannot permit low quality medical collages to operate. The low quality of Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital has already been revealed.

Q Princess of Wales will be playing a Big Match versus Girls High School very soon
A - It is on 5th August 2017 at Cambrian grounds. I am busy with the coaching aspects.
Q Who is behind your success
A  Firstly, it was my parents and my brother and now my husband Primal Liyanage. We have a son who is studying at St. Peters College.
Q What is the advice you can give to the young cricketers
A - Not only the young girls. I like to say something to the parents too. If your daughter is talented and interested in any game send her to take part. The student should be religious, study hard, well mannered especially the girls and above all you should be honest at all times.

How Toby Roland-Jones became the terminator
Toby Roland-Jones doesn't have wow factor. He doesn't bowl at 90mph and he doesn't swing the ball round corners. What he does is get good batsmen out.
That's the verdict of Richard Johnson, bowling coach and good friend of the England seam sensation who took eight for 129 in his Test debut at The Oval  including a first-innings five-for which ripped through South Africa's top order.
The 29-year-old has been bothering batsmen in the County Championship for some time now, shooting to prominence with a hat-trick against Yorkshire to win the county title for Middlesex on last year's final day. So if not pace or movement through the air, what is it about Roland-Jones that makes him so dangerous
'If you were to ask batsmen they'd say everything feels like it's coming in to the bat, but he actually gets a bit of away shape a lot of the time,' Johnson explains to Sportsmail.
'The angle he bowls at means some balls come in to the batsman and some move away  it makes him unpredictable and very hard to line up.
'In county cricket, he makes people play and miss more than anyone I've known. 'He also hits the bat hard. He bowls a heavy ball, hitting the bat on the splice so you feel the contact more than when you middle it.
Because of his height he gets quite a steep bounce and hits the bat higher up.
'The thing with Tobes is that he opens up good players and gets them out. You see that when you watch him every day but if you don't see him that often he doesn't have that wow factor.
'He got Hashim Amla out twice at The Oval! That first dismissal (squaring Amla up and flicking his glove on its way through to Jonny Bairstow) was the kind all fast bowlers want.
And it was classic RoJo.' The lack of eye-catching pace and swing Johnson alludes to, coupled with England's rich supply of quality fast bowlers, might explain why it has taken Roland-Jones until his late 20s to make the Test team.
In fact, after representing Middlesex in age-group cricket in his youth, he dropped out of the county scene altogether to attend Leeds University and it was only off the back of his impressive performances for Surrey Premier League side Sunbury that he was brought back into the set-up in 2010.
And Johnson, who has worked closely with Roland-Jones from his time at Sunbury throughout his senior Middlesex career, is convinced the bowler's long road to the top has provided him with an appreciation of his own game that will prove invaluable at the highest level.
'He's learned to understand his action and understand that not every day is going to be great,' Johnson says.
'A lot of people are so up and down, when it doesn't feel good every time they start to panic. Toby doesn't, and that's a massive trait. He'll run up one day and think, 'It's not feeling great but I'm going to do a job  whatever I've got today is what I've got and I'll deal with it'. This is what the real top bowlers do.
'He's also got quite a basic, repeatable action, which means he's rarely expensive. He's worked out why he bowls well when he bowls well.
'He's very rounded and mature, and he doesn't get too excited or too down about things. He looks at everything from a very level-headed perspective.
'The way he bowls reflects his personality  very reliable, a real solid bloke. The sort you want good things to happen to.'  Daily Mail

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya presided over the two hour special sitting from 10.30 am to 12.30 pm. The motion to felicitate the Premier was presented by Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella and was seconded by Opposition Leader R Sampanthan.
Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader and Minister Rauf Hakeem expressed his dismay over the lack of decency of the JO and JVP members to boycott the felicitation debate.
The decency we as the MPs should observe on solemn occasions like this has sunk to the lowest level with some of the Opposition MPs boycotting this felicitation debate. This is a very sorry state of affairs.
In my 23 years of Parliament life this is the first time I see the essential Parliamentary decency has sunk to the lowest level. Some of the Opposition MPs have compromised their principles for the sake of cheap political expediency, Hakeem noted.
Speaking at the debate, UPFA Parliamentary Group Leader and Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva pointed out the importance of shedding vituperous politics and joining in congratulating the senior politicians as they reach important political milestones. Today it is Wickremesinghe and tomorrow it could be TNA Leader Sampanthan, JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake or MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena. It is unacceptable for you to refuse to participate in an occasion like this just because of the rival political views you hold, de Silva said.
A large number of visitors were seen in the public gallery to watch the proceedings. Prior to the commencement of the sittings, the Secretary-General of Parliament and his staff had organised a Bodhi Pooja to invoke blessings on the Prime Minister.

Karunaratne blames poor first-class structure for Lankas ills
Opener Dimuth Karunaratne blamed the countrys poor domestic first-class tournament for the ills of Sri Lanka cricket.
Compared to the last series played between the two teams two years ago which was competitive the current Sri Lanka side is struggling to come to terms with a confident Indian team being hit for over 600 plus runs in two consecutive Test matches.
The difference according to Karunaratne was the amount of cricket the two countries played.
They (India) play a lot of good cricket. Theyve played a lot of IPL and first-class cricket. In Sri Lanka we only have 8 to 10 domestic matches in first-class. Then we have five one-dayers. Thats it for the season. Thats the main reason, said Karunaratne.
We have to play more first-class cricket and then we can find more players who can dominate the game. Thats the thinking  what Sri Lanka Cricket has to work on for the players, he said.
Although we have no Sanga (Sangakkara) this time we have a bunch of young guys who can dominate the game if we play fearless cricket.
Karunaratne also admitted that the Lankan bowlers were not consistent with their lines and lengths and this has enabled India to score runs easily.
There was help in the wicket  you have to admit that. In Galle though there wasnt much in the wicket, it was the way Shikhar (Dhawan) batted that took the game away from us. We had to go to defensive fields. We cant attack when two fours are being hit in an over. When we go to defensive fields, they are very smart, so they work the singles, said Karunaratne.
Here we bowled well, but in patches. We bowled a few short balls. I dont think we will get short balls from the Indian team maybe once in five or six overs. We made a few little mistakes with the ball  the short balls especially.
It became easy for them. When the runs are flowing its difficult for a captain to set the field. He will have to spread it. Pujara and Rahane then worked the singles. Thats the main reason they got over 600, he said.
PRADEEP OUT
"Fast bowler Nuwan Pradeep who suffered a left hamstring injury will be out for two to three months said Karunaratne.
On the question of why Sri Lanka bowlers cannot emulate the Indian counterparts, Karunaratne said, Maybe they are trying to do variations. Maybe they were a little less aggressive. In Test cricket all the best batsmen play, and we have to bowl intelligently. We have to bowl on one side and set the field.
It takes 10-15 overs to get a wicket. In the domestic level sometimes you can get five wickets from five overs.
International cricket is very different, and we need to get used to that. Like its tough to get a run, its also difficult to get a wicket. We need to learn how to bowl on one side of the wicket and to our field. We need to work hard at it and force the opposition to make mistakes.
REVERSE SWEEP THE KEY
Karunaratne said that Sri Lanka wants to save the Test match and a lot would depend on the overnight pair Kusal Mendis and Dinesh Chandimal.
In the first 10-15 overs with the ball hardness it is not easy to bat. After the hardness is gone the help is not there for the spinners. Chandi and Kusal batted really well in the last few overs.
We have to play positively especially the sweep and the reverse sweep, said Karunaratne. The last time when we played in Galle Chandi got 160-odd scoring a lot of runs off the sweep and reverse sweep. I think that will be key.
Karunaratne who was asked to bowl as the second seamer in the side said that he was not surprised when he was asked the question whether he could to it.
I started my career as a bowler, not as a batsman, so I can bowl. The thing is there are a lot of bowlers who can bowl faster than 130-135. We played only with once pace option, so when they asked me if we need to bowl a few overs with the new ball, I said I could. Thats why I bowled a few overs with Chaminda Vaas to see how it goes, Karunaratne said.
He also picked up his first Test wicket when he dismissed centurion Cheteswar Pujara lbw for 133.

Pakistan dethrones Nawaz Sharif
It is an irony of fate that Nawaz Sharif had been Prime Minister of Pakistan three times but unable to complete the full term of five years each time. The first time it was the President Ghulam Khan which dismissed him in 1993. Next time he was deposed by the Army. This time it was by the Supreme Court. Thus he was dismissed by the Executive, the Military and the Judiciary
Delivering judgement on a petition filed against Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs election to Parliament the Supreme Court of Pakistan unseated him from Parliament under Article 62 1(f) of the Constitution. Ironically Nawaz Sharif supported the passing of this Article when most other parties opposed it. The Supreme Court held that Sharif had violated this Article when he did not disclose the fact that he received a salary as Chairman of a Dubai-based firm in his nomination papers for the election in 2013.
It is an irony of fate that he had been Prime Minister of Pakistan three times but unable to complete the full term of five years each time. The first time it was the President Ghulam Khan which dismissed him in 1993. Next time he was deposed by the Army. This time it was by the Supreme Court. Thus he was dismissed by the Executive, the Military and the Judiciary.
In April 2016 Panama Papers revealed that Nawaz Sharifs children had set up offshore companies in British Virgin Islands which owned properties in Britain. Then Imran Khan filed a petition in the Supreme Court against Nawaz Sharif.
Parliament has elected Shahid Abbhas as the interim Prime Minister. Though there were reports that Nawaz Sharif intends to nominate his brother as Prime Minister it is not yet confirmed whether he would do so or allow the Interim President to complete the remaining 10 months in office before the next elections. His brother Shabaz Sharif is currently the Chief Minister of Punjab.
Nawaz Sharif has throughout his tenure called for better relations with India but every instance of rapprochement was followed by terrorist attacks on Indian targets or provocations in the Indo-Pakistan border in their aftermath.
It was also commonly held that his relations with the military were not so cordial. It is revealing that the Wall Street Journal commenting on the ouster of Nawaz Sharif had called upon the new PM to cede more powers to the military. In Pakistan there is a type of dual power held by civilian administration and the military establishment. Pakistan has a history of military rule extending to almost half the period of its development as a State.
Rating agency Moody has predicted political instability in the present situation and warned that it could affect the economy adversely. There is also a possibility of a series of petitions against leaders of other political parties mentioned in the Panama Papers.
Bangladesh SC rules against Government
In July the Supreme Court of Bangladesh in delivering judgement on an appeal by the Government against a High Court verdict which ruled that Article 16 of the Constitution which gave power to Parliament to remove Supreme Court judges for misconduct or inefficiency was illegal and unconstitutional upheld the original decision of the High Court.
In May 2016, the High Court after hearing a public interest petition filed by nine Supreme Court lawyers had ruled that the 16th Amendment was illegal and unconstitutional, since it was contrary to the principles of the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary. The Amendment abolished the Chief Justice-led Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) which had the power to remove a Supreme Court judge after following due process and vested that power in Parliament as in the original Constitution of 1972.
In deciding against the 16th Amendment both the High Court and the Supreme Court observed that keeping intact Article 70 of the Constitution and giving powers to Parliament to remove Supreme Court judges placed judges at the mercy of party high command.
Article 70 of the Constitution says: A person elected as a member of parliament at an election at which he was nominated as a candidate by a political party shall vacate his seat if he resigns from that party; or votes in parliament against that party; but shall not thereby be disqualified for subsequent election as a member of parliament.
The decision of the Supreme Court was welcomed by the Opposition and civil society organisations while members of the Government including senior ministers were critical of it.
More sanctions on Russia
Last week the US Congress passed legislation imposing more sanctions on Russia. These are in addition to those imposed by the Obama administration in 2014 following Russias annexation of East Ukraine which included an asset freeze, restrictions on Russias oil industry, state finance and technology et al.
New targets include Russian Railways, Shipping, Metals and Mining industries as well as sanctions on companies dealing with Russian oil industry. Moreover new legislation prevents the US President from removing any sanctions without Congress approval. President Trump has expressed displeasure and said that relations with Russia is at a dangerous low. Russia has described the sanctions as a full-scale trade war.
In retaliation Russia has limited the staff of the US Embassy in Moscow to 455, which amounts to an expulsion of 755 diplomats. Any reduction of Russian staff in its Embassy in Washington would be met with further simultaneous equal reduction of US embassy staff in Moscow, according to the Russian Government.
Some European nations are unhappy about the new sanctions as it would affect their economic interests, particularly their energy security.

Neymar said he has joined "one of the most ambitious clubs in Europe".
"Paris St-Germain's ambition attracted me to the club, along with the passion and the energy this brings," he added.
"I feel ready to take the challenge. From today, I will do everything I can to help my new team-mates."
The French side have arranged a news conference for 12:30 BST on Friday.
Neymar will then be introduced to fans on Saturday at PSG's first game of the season against Amiens at Parc des Princes.
PSG reached the last eight of the Champions League last season - knocked out by a Neymar-inspired Barcelona - and were beaten to the French title by Monaco.
After weeks of speculation, Neymar arrived for training with Barcelona on Wednesday with his father and representative, and told the Spanish club he wanted to leave. BBC

[Parliament (05-08-2017)]
By not agreeing to LTTEs Interim Self-Governing proposal:
Ranil Wickremesinghe gave away his political fortunes:Hakeem
Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader and Minister Rauf Hakeem yesterday, told Parliament that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe gave away his political fortunes at two critical elections in 2004 and 2005, by choosing not to agree unconditionally to the Interim Self-Governing Authority proposed by the LTTE.
The minister came up with the revelation, joining in the felicitation debate to mark Prime Minister Wickremesinghes completion of 40 years in Parliament.
Wickremesinghe is sometimes, unfairly criticized for many reasons. But I would wish to say something many people may have not known. If Wickremesinghe unconditionally agreed to the Interim Self-Governing Authority proposed by the LTTE, he would have been the President in 2005 and he would have won the Parliamentary Elections in 2004. I am one of those witnesses to the fact that he steadfastly refused to agree to pressure by even our facilitators to look at ISGA unconditionally and agree to some of those issues contained in the ISGA document, the Minister Hakeem noted.
Hakeem hailed Prime Minister Wickremesinghe as arguably the sharpest intellect in our contemporary political scene. The minister also commended the Premier for standing steadfast for amity and harmony of all ethnic communities. As a leader of a minority party, I am bold enough to say that only a very few lived to endure in amity and harmony with everyone in this country. Wickremesinghe is indeed an iconic leader, he said.
Commending on the patience and perseverance of the Premier, the minister said Wickremesinghe is endowed with essential qualities, to surmount the difficulties in steering the ship of Government.
Though some may see his human chemistry as somewhat wanting at times, which is unavoidable for any leader at the helm of power with all stress of day-to-day political pressures, even his worst enemies would notice one special trait in him. That is, whenever he speaks in Parliament, even in his most aggressive presentations, he is rarely seen as intimidating. That is an essential quality of a mature political leader which is quite unique to Wickremesinghe. He is undoubtedly one of our most gifted leaders, he noted.
High office sought him out not due to destiny, but for his quintessential quality of steadfast loyalty to his party and his policy consistency. When I talk of party loyalty, I would like to remind you particularly, the loyalty he showed President Premadasa when he faced the impeachment. Such qualities are the reasons why he was able to surmount all the vicissitudes of the political winds in this country and rise to the position of Prime Ministership on four occasions, he remarked.
Hakeem also pointed out that Wickremesinghe constantly stood against racial disharmony in the country. When the previous administration of which I was also unfortunately a Member, was blinded by the euphoria of a military victory and allowed xenophobic forces to raise their ugly head and create racial disharmony in the country, the Prime Minister from the Opposition Benches then steadfastly condemned such acts and insisted on bringing such forces to account. He did the same during the term of this Government, when these same forces were trying to disturb the hard-fought harmony among ethnicities, he stated.
Observing that Wickremesinghes political trajectory was intrinsically embedded in the 1977 economic revolution, Hakeem pointed out that 1977 was a transformational year in the post-independence history of this country. Unshackling a fully-insulated, centrally directed socialist economy and introducing a market-driven open economy, while having to retain the essential features of a welfare state, was a very difficult balancing act for any Head of State or Prime Minister. Coming into politics with President J. R. Jayewardene, who believed in market reform and free enterprise being the key driving forces to achieve economic growth and social advancement, our Prime Minister today, is following the social market economic principles, he added.
Hakeem also reminding that he was the only one left in the House now who was part of the negotiating team with the LTTE back in 2002, said, I will witness one thing. Several people sometimes find fault with him for having signed the Ceasefire Agreement with the LTTE.
Those who are pragmatic enough to understand the political situation then, with our International Airport being attacked by the LTTE, the new Government had few options, but to also look at the sentiments of the International Community, he added.
History would prove Ranils decisions were always correct:Nimal
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has developed foreign relations more than any other politician which could be used for the development of the country, said Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva.
He made this observation, joining the Vote of Felicitation on Premier Wickremesinghe on his completion of continuous membership of Parliament for over a period of 40 years.
He also said the Premier had a distinguished knowledge of history, world history, economy, culture, foreign affairs, finance management and parliamentary democracy.
He exhibits his talents, skills and knowledge when taking decisions. He said that the Premier took practical decisions on several occasions due to these reasons - one being to assist President Maithripala Sirisena at the 2015 Presidential election at which the latter won proving Premier Ranil Wickremesinghes decision correct.
He added that the Premier made a commendable contribution for moving the Information Bill.
He also said at an election they contested from separate political parties, but it does not say they engage in hate politics.
He also added that history would identify Premier Wickremesinghe as a politician who took correct decisions.
PM: mature, calm, stable and subtle person not easily ruffled:Opp. Leader
The distinguished personality of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe needs to bear fruit in a more visible manner in future, said Opposition Leader R Sampanthan yesterday.
He made this observation, seconding the Vote of Felicitation on Premier Wickremesinghe on his completion of continuous membership of Parliament for over a period of 40 years.
He said that Premier Wickremesinghe is a mature, calm, stable and subtle person. He is not a person who could be easily ruffled, the Opposition Leader said. He is both locally and internationally respected as a politician with a vision. This aspect of personality of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe needs to bear fruit in a more visible manner. 
He said the Premier takes correct decisions, irrespective of any other consideration.
He decided to field Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena in 2015, irrespective of pressure demanding him to be the opposition candidate, Sampanthan said.
His bold decision was justified by the results. Then the incumbent government followed a commendable path deviated from its predecessor. He said when the premiers future is concerned, the government has to solve the national issue which has an inexplicable link with the economy.
He added that both the President and Prime Minister have to get together to find a solution to the national issue.
Ranil most skilled politician not only in Sri Lanka, but the entire region:Kiriella
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who had become Prime Minister on four occasions, is the most skilled politician not only in Sri Lanka, but also in the entire region, said Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday.
He made this observation moving the Vote of Felicitation on Premier Wickremesinghe on his completion of continuous membership of Parliament for over a period of 40 years.
He also had held the position of Opposition Leader at four occasions.
Minister Kiriella said that Premier Wickremesinghe was first elected to Parliament on July 21, 1977, from the Biyagama electorate and sworn in on August 04 the same year. He was then appointed Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister in the 1977 Government and Youth Affairs and Employment Minister in the 1978 Government. He was the then youngest Cabinet Minister who at 29 years.
He could give a new lease of life to the National Youth Services Council during that period. He was appointed the Education Minister in 1980 and he set up Educational Colleges, paving the way to recruit talented teachers to the schools. He initiated a programme to grant free school text books, uniforms and lunch during the same period.
He was appointed the Industries Minister in 1989 and the Industries and Science and Technology Minister in 1990. During this period, he set up many Industrial Zones, creating enormous amount of jobs for the youth. He also held the position of the Leader of the House during this period.
Minister Kiriella said that after the assassination of President R Premadasa on May 01, 1993 by LTTE terrorists, D. B. Wijethunga was appointed President of the Country on May 07, while Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed the 10th Prime Minister of the country.
When the UNP won the General Election on December 05, 2001, Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed Prime Minister for a second time on December 09, 2001. When Maithripala Sirisena was elected President on January 08, 2015, Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed Prime Minister for a third time. Thereafter, the UNP won the General Election on August 17, 2015, acquiring majority of the seats.
Thereafter when the UNP and the SLFP set up the unity government, Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed Prime Minister for the fourth time. He is holding the National Policies and the Economic Affairs Ministerial portfolio as well.
Minister Kiriella further said that the passage of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution by this government with a two third majority, was a constructive step forward kept in the direction of democracy.
The introduction of the Sectoral Oversight Committees in Parliament, strengthened the Legislature.
The objective of Premier Wickremesinghe is to make the country prosperous with vibrant democracy and human rights. He has proved that he was a thorough reader and takes wise decisions patiently, exhibiting leadership qualities.
Minister Kiriella said that Premier Wickremesinghe was regarded throughout the world as an experienced politician.
He said that Parliament appreciated the selfless and dedicated services rendered by Premier Wickremesinghe to the country in general and conveys his best wishes in all his future endeavours.

PM assures equal rights for all
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said that a political solution should be evolved during the term of this Parliament to ensure that people of all communities enjoy equal rights.
We should evolve a political solution within the period of the current Parliament, to ensure that no citizen receives step motherly treatment, while sincerely thanking all members who joined in the special felicitation session to congratulate him as he completes 40 years in Parliamen, the PM said.
The Prime Minister making the winding up speech, invited all to work together to achieve consistent economic growth and lay the foundation for a stable and advanced economy.
Now the war is over. We have to work for national unity, resolving of the national question, rebuilding of economy and attaining development. It is time for us to cast aside ethnic divisions and work tirelessly to accomplish these goals. Parliament will play a central role in all our endeavours. We have strengthened Parliamentary powers and democracy to cater to this mission, the Premier said.
Recollecting his past political experiences, the Prime Minister said, We learnt to go back to the Opposition after being in the ruling party. This experience is similar to King Walagamba hiding in the jungle. Only those who have undergone it understand it, the Premier quipped.
Speaking of what he learnt from being in politics for decades, the Prime Minister said valuing advices of elderly scholars as gold and learning from his own experiences helped him to achieve success.
The Premier expressed his gratitude for former Presidents late J.R Jayewardene and R. Premadasa for their guidance to shape his political career. From being an MP, I climbed up the ladder to be a Deputy Minister, Minister, Opposition Leader and the Prime Minister. In my political life, I saw how the country grappled with insurgencies, separatism, terrorism and war. There had also been an impeachment of a President, assassination of a President and assassination of an Opposition Leader. Then there had been exercises to usher in peace. We saw the end of war and jailing of the war winning Army Commander. For the first time a large number of civil groups came together to support Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena and subsequent to his victory we formed a national unity government. All these are crucial landmarks in my political journey, the Prime Minister reminisced.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe Wickremesainghe also mentioned his contemporaries Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan and Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera who entered Parliament together with him 40 years ago ago.
Their Parliamentary service was interrupted as Sampanthan decided to resign from his Parliamentary seat over a policy decision and Jayawickrema Perera resigned to contest the Provincial Council elections, the PM recollected.
While thanking all who supported him in his political journey including his parents, wife, family members, staff and party members, the Premier gave out four advices from his years of political experience. Discipline yourself. Be patient. Work without any jealousy. Accept both victory and defeat alike, he stated.
The Premier wrapped up his speech referring to Dhammapadaya in which he highlighted the message that the intellectuals do practice self-control.

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party Youth Front (SLFPYF) Chairman, Shantha Bandara said yesterday, that President Maithripala Sirisena would take a suitable decision at the appropriate time after the completion of investigations by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry(PCI) into the Treasury Bond transaction.
He said the UNP came into power pledging to end corruption. But this was not done properly. Therefore, we must thank President Maithripala Sirisena for appointing the Presidential Commission to probe into the scam.
He further said if a government servant was found guilty of fraud or corruption, in addition to legal action, an investigation too would be initiated at an institutional level and appropriate punishment meted out. But, no such punishment or institutional investigations against
corrupt politicians had been taken. Therefore, instead of initiating legal action, a relevant political party should hold an internal investigation against corrupt politicians. The Yahapalan government came into power promising the people a clean and honest political journey. Therefore, we must fulfil that promise by taking appropriate action against wrongdoers, he said.
The truth has been finally revealed to the public as a result of the Presidential Commission being appointed by the President. The Commission has always acted independently, permitting all parties to give their evidence.
He added that Judges of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Bond issue, must be provided with sufficient security to act without fear.
Commenting on the violence created by several criminal gangs operating in the North, he said President Maithripala Sirisena had advised the Security Forces to crack down organised crime in the Jaffna Peninsula. We still remember how the people of Sri Lanka had suffered immense hardships due to the war. We lost thousands of lives, while the country suffered a huge set back in terms of economic and infrastructure development.
He further said the Joint Opposition should have waited till the Presidential Commission ended its sittings if they wanted to bring a non-confidence motion against Minister Ravi Karunanayake. But it was presented shortly with the aim of gaining political advantage.

PTL CEO hands over his mobile phone to investigators
PTL CEO Kasun Palisena handed over his mobile phone to the forensic investigators attached to the Treasury Bond Commission yesterday.
However, Perpetual Capital Holdings' attorney Kalinga Indatissa questioned the Attorney Generals directive to PTL CEO Kasun Palisena to hand over all his digital communication devices, at the Treasury Bond Commission yesterday.
PTL CEO Kasun Palisena will testify before the Treasury Bond Commission on August 8, 2017.
Indatissa PC said the Presidential Commission of Inquiry Act does not provide the Attorney General such powers.
Indatissa also requested a ruling from the Treasury Bond Commission to treat Palisenas mobile phone the same way the PCoI has treated former Governor Arjun Mahendrans phone after surrendering to the CID led forensic examination.

Rotation makes the sporting world go around
In Fight Club, his incendiary rumination on the existential thrill of being punched in the gob, David Fincher does a spectacular job of skewering the Ikea nesting instinct that lives in most of us. One quote has always stayed in the Spins mind. After his condo is burned down  by himself, the daft bugger, but he doesnt know that yet  Ed Nortons character tells Brad Pitt: When you buy furniture, you tell yourself: Thats it, thats the last sofa Im gonna need. Whatever else happens, Ive got that sofa problem handled.
Cricket teams are constructed in a similar way. We have the same nesting instinct, to build a team piece by piece. It came to mind again after Toby Roland-Joness wonderful debut at The Oval. Whatever else happens, England have got that backup third-seamer problem handled.
Except they havent. Roland-Jones could be a lot better than a backup third seamer; and a look up the order to Keaton Jennings shows the inherent folly of inking someone in after a spectacular debut. Teams are always in flux. One minute you buy a lovely new sofa; the next you notice the dining table is chipped. Sure, you can still use it, but theres a beautiful one on offer at John Lewis 
There was little logic in the idea of a permanent XI even before the international schedule became a human-rights issue. Selectors hardly ever pick the best XI for today, because they need to have half an eye on tomorrow. If you always picked the best team for the next match, youd never give anyone a debut, because it would safer to pick somebody with Test experience.
The Spin has a simple theory on this: if its good enough for Alex Ferguson, the greatest football manager of all time, its good enough for cricket. When we won the Treble in 1999, Ferguson said, it wasnt because of the XI. It was because of the pool. Ferguson was the pioneer of rotation in this country. At first it was controversial  a local MP complained in the House of Commons when he picked Paul Scholes, David Beckham and Gary Neville to play a League Cup game at Port Vale  but after a couple of years it was the norm.
For some reason, and despite the acceptance of squad rotation in what we are contractually obliged to describe as white-ball cricket, it is taking much longer for us to accept it as part of Test cricket. Its seven years since the old farts (and a few young ones) harrumphed over Englands decision to leave Andrew Strauss and James Anderson out of the tour of Bangladesh with a view to the following winters Ashes series. That turned out reasonably well.
We are not advocating wholesale changes, or suggesting England should leave Anderson and Stuart Broad out of the final Test against South Africa. There are clear differences in the demands and rhythms of club football and Test cricket. There are fewer games; you are playing the same team from week to week; you cant put your best players on the substitutes bench in case of emergency; and you dont have a 25-man first-team squad.
Yet the guiding principle is universal. There are clear limits to what man can endure and achieve, both physically and mentally. (We accept Adam Peaty has slightly undermined our argument in the past week.) This is particularly relevant to fast bowlers, though not exclusively: spin bowlers suffer wear and tear, as Graeme Swann will tell you, and the unique mental strain of Test cricket affects everyone.
In the modern game, the best way to pick a team is surely to have one eye on today and one on tomorrow. Rest is essential for all players, and when you consider injuries  not to mention the potential demands of panto season in Bournemouth  its almost impossible to stick with the same team. Even the 2005 Ashes winners, an XI everyone can name, only played four Tests together. The Manchester United team that won the Champions League final against Chelsea in 2008 never started a match before or after; Ferguson came up with a bespoke solution for a bespoke problem. Instead of wondering what happens to Roland-Jones when Chris Woakes is fit, we should be happy that England have strengthened an already decent pool of fast bowlers. They will need them in Australia.
The key to a change of mindset is to de-stigmatise being omitted, and phase out words and phrases like dropped and axed. What next: Jennings has been guillotined from the England team South Africa have hung, drawn and quartered JP Duminy The words rotated or rested are not the euphemisms they seem. Why, for example, shouldnt Anderson be given the West Indies series off Why couldnt Joe Root or Ben Stokes miss a couple of Tests in the same series You cant measure mental fatigue but everyone suffers it, even superhero freaks like Stokes.
No player would like being left out, particularly against weaker opposition. In Tests in Zimbabwe, Jacques Kallis had a batting average of 503. Who would want to miss out on that bounty This attitude is widespread, yet its a clear case of putting the individual before the team, and years of watching players misuse DRS is emphatic evidence that many have little idea what is best for themselves or the team. If the players dont like it, Anthony Scaramucci can probably advise them on what they have to do.
In 1999, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer scored four goals for Manchester United against Everton. He scored again in the next game against Valencia. Three days later he was on the bench against West Ham. He wasnt dropped or axed. I thought I deserved to play but he is the boss, nobody can dispute his record, Solskjaer said. Hes the best in the business.
Fans wouldnt like it either. A best XI is a crutch for the 99.94% of cricket tragics who might legitimately be described as anally retentive. And it would do devastating damage to one of our staple pub chats. Go on then, give me your XI for each of the next 10 Tests, doesnt work quite so well as a conversation stimulant.
Cricket has always been strikingly innovative in some areas and weirdly resistant to change in others. The number of cautious declarations show that most would rather draw three games than win two and lose one where the defeat invited extra criticism. The same is true of rotation: if England omit, say, Stokes and Root and lose a Test to the West Indies, it would erroneously be viewed as a mistake that should never be repeated. Its a pretty immature attitude.
Ferguson was a master of calculated risk when it came to rotation. He would provisionally plan 10 games ahead. Occasionally his tinkering led to embarrassing defeat but there were far more victories  and, crucially, his players were usually at their peak when it really mattered. At different points of the Treble season of 1998-99, he ordered Peter Schmeichel and Gary Neville to go on holiday because they looked either mentally or physically fatigued. In the same season he left out four regulars for one of the defining games of his career, the FA Cup semi-final replay against Arsenal.
There are other reasons for changing a team from game to game. In the World Cup, Heather Knight made it clear England had picked the off-spinner Laura Marsh instead of the slow left-armer Alex Hartley because Sri Lanka had so many left-handers. Marsh took four wickets. Its good enough for the World Cup winners, yet some saw the mens team as weak for picking a right-hander at No3 to combat Vernon Philander and Morne Morkel. To completely ignore the strengths of the opposition is the height of misplaced machismo, like slicing off a finger on a first date to show how manly you are.
Again, with apologies to those who hate football and/or Manchester United, we can learn from Ferguson. When United played Milan in the 2009-10 Champions League, he gave the diligent Park Ji-sung, usually a winger, the job of neutralising Milans playmaker Andrea Pirlo. It was a masterstroke. Pirlos influence was negligible, and United won 7-2 on aggregate.
The way we see it is this: if Test cricket exists in the year 2030, rotation will be the norm. Why not get a headstart

Skill up Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka has always prioritised youths, placing them at the heart of development. Youth skills development has been identified as an important aspect in reducing youth unemployment.
Although youth unemployment rate in the country has decreased to 18.5 percent in the first quarter of 2017 from 21 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, a critical need for marketable skills is reflected in the labour market.
Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training
Chandima Weerakkody
To change Sri Lankas perception of skilled careers, an innovative National Mass Media Campaign Ekata/Onraa was launched on Tuesday in Colombo with the participation of a variety of speakers and personalities.
The campaign was launched under the banner `Skill Up Sri Lanka and is aimed at addressing the urgent issue of skilled labour shortages in some of the growing sectors of Sri Lankan economy. It will raise awareness about the value and importance of careers in these sectors.
It is an open platform through which key stakeholders are encouraged to join to ensure that the message is spread throughout the country. The campaign `Ekata/Onraa targets four sectors including Lite Engineering and Automotive, Construction, Hospitality and Tourism and Information Communication and Technology.
It hopes to increase the number of young men and women, including People with Disabilities (PWDs) and youth affected by war, entering the labour market in these strategic growth industries. It will also raise awareness of current opportunities, to raise level of dignity of labour in the sectors as well as to inspire and create excitement the future of Sri Lanka and its young men and women.
Challenge
Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Chandima Weerakkody said it was a challenge to match the quality qualified employees to the requirements in the labour market.
The ministry is ready to undertake the challenge. Everyone is keen about their children. Parents aspire to give the best to their children. Our target is also to create trained skilled techno savvy people. Although youth is keen on gaining vocational training, the chances are limited. The intake should be expanded accommodating more students, he said.
Minister Weerakkody said several steps were taken to address the mismatch of skills in the labour market.
It is important to generate greater awareness of technical, vocational education and training and develop other skills relevant to local and global economies. Peoples attitude towards some careers should be changed. The ministry will see that all vocational careers are looked at with dignity. We will maintain the international standards, bring in the unique uniforms and councils will be established to give recognition to these careers. It is expected that it would contribute to reducing unemployment and underemployment among the youth in Sri Lanka. All stakeholders should work together to achieve this goal, he said.
The Minister pointed out that a skills passport was launched by the ministry to make Sri Lankan youth accepted anywhere in the globe. The passport will hold the employees level of vocational training, language proficiency and previous experience which will make Sri Lankan youth internationally recognized.
On entering the job market, young persons face difficult situations, either due to skills mismatch between what they have learned and what kinds of jobs are available. Sri Lankas labour market also reflects such skills mismatches. Jobs available are either unattractive to youth due to the precarious nature of employment, perceptions of youth about the occupation, stigma attached to the particular occupation or sector of employment, or due to the fact that the labour market opportunities simply do not meet their aspirations. This is more marked among educated youth who have often secured a qualification without relevant work experience. It is perhaps better articulated as a misunderstanding of the demands of the world of work.
Hence, once qualified they raise the bar of their goals, soon to be disappointed and disillusioned. Queuing for a good job is another issue of educated youth in the labour market. Much of this happens with the acquiescence of parents who invariably influence the aspirations of their children, encouraging them to await that ideal job.
Youth seem to lack the confidence to experiment in the world of work or move out of their comfort zones and use their academic qualifications to innovate. On the other hand, the lesser qualified are perhaps more likely to take a chance in the world of work, moving out earlier and ultimately gaining more and much needed experience along the way. The more qualified being left behind therefore, idle and unable to realise their full potential.
Many qualified youth in Sri Lanka tend to possess the technical skills or appropriate academic qualification for a job but lack the soft skills to convert knowledge into a profession. English is often taught as a subject rather than as a skill for the world of work. This is more often an obstacle to many educated rural youth to secure jobs particularly in the private sector where businesses engage with the global community and demand the knowledge of a global language. Chairman, Diesel and Motor Engineering Plc,
Ranjith Pandithage speaking at the occasion said auto mobile industry, which is one of the fastest growing industries at present, lacks professionals.
We need painters, welders and mechanics. If Sri Lankan youth do not possess these skills, we have to get skilled labour from other countries. Parents should not aspire only to create professional like doctors and lawyers out of their children, but they should be exposed to skills that are in demand, he said.
Automobile service
DIMO was the first to tap North after the conclusion of the conflict. We train many young persons in our automobile school. DIMO offers a comprehensive training on automobile service, maintenance and repair. They are great opportunities and youth can yield better career prospects and earn a higher income, Pandithage said.
Speaking on the prospects prevailing in the Information Communication and Technology industry, President, Federation of Information Technology Industry Sri Lanka, Dr Kithsiri Manchanayaka said todays youth have a responsibility to assist the ICT industry.
The skills the youth possess are not adequate and some skills are not employable. There is a mismatch between the skills and the requirement of the industry. There is a huge potential. We are targeting five billion dollar exports in 2020 which means there will be about 200,000 opportunities available. ICT is one of the fastest growing industries which account up to 1.2 billion dollars exports at present," he said.
"Youth need to upgrade their skills to fill up the positions that would be available with the growth of the industry in future, he said.
Manager Operations, Jetwing Hotels, Dmitri Cooray encouraged youth to enter the tourism and hospitality industry casting aside prejudices that prevail in society about the industry. He pointed out that Jetwing hotels have been training youth around the country making them relevant with the technological and social changes.
The initial investment of this campaign was made by the Government of Canada through World University Service of Canada (WUSC)  a Canadian education development agency that has had a long standing and reputable presence in Sri Lanka since 1989. As one of the largest Canadian agencies in Sri Lanka, the WUSC is active throughout the country with a focus on strengthening the vocational training sector, as well as reducing poverty and social exclusion in plantation communities.
The High Commissioner of Canada to Sri Lanka and Maldives, Shelley Whiting stressed the importance of vocational training.
A vocational job offers good opportunities and vocational training creates careers that will make more people involved in the economic sector. Quality education and training will improve their relevance to labour market needs. Business community should create awareness of the importance of vocational training, Whiting said.
She added that the Canadian Government has assisted in providing vocational training to many young persons around the country including Mulativ, Matara, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Killinochchi and Jaffna.
Whiting said social media plays a vital role in getting the message across to the youth scattered in the country. Social marketing, a dynamic approach to social change which uses commercial marketing tactics to promote social goods that can benefit the entire community will be used to address the issue of limited recognition of the value of vocational skills and careers. The social marketing campaign will incorporate television, radio, print and digital media targeting to reach at least 8.4 million people in Sri Lanka. In addition to the media campaign community engagement activities will take place reinforcing the values of vocational training and upgrading the skills in some of the fastest growing industries in the country.
Finally, all stake holders in public and the private sector need to work closely to reduce skills mismatches. It is important for companies and employers organizations to take the initiative and collaborate with educational and vocational training institutions while making sure that during education and training, youth, particularly those from marginalized locations and disadvantaged communities have equal opportunities to gain work experience, via internships, on-the-job training, and other schemes.

South Africa double stops England in their tracks
MANCHESTER Aug4: South Africa checked England's progress with two wickets in quick succession after lunch on the first day of the fourth Test at Old Trafford on Friday.
Alastair Cook (46) and Essex team-mate Tom Westley (29) both fell with the score on 92 as England saw two wickets go down for no runs in 19 balls.
Dawid Malan helped England captain Joe Root put on 52 for the fourth wicket before, having battled hard, he fell to Morne Morkel for 18.
At tea, England were 147 for four, with star batsman Root 34 not out after winning the toss.
Ben Stokes, fresh from his man-of-the-match winning century in England's 239-run victory in the third Test at The Oval, was one not out after facing just three balls on Friday.
A South Africa attack missing injured seamers Vernon Philander and Chris Morris, both ruled out with lower back strains, had done well to restrict England.
The hosts were making steady progress when former captain Cook tried to drive left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj but instead got a thin edge to wicket-keeper Quinton de Kock.
Left-handed opener Cook, England's all-time leading Test run-scorer, faced 103 balls including six fours.
Westley, fresh from a second-innings fifty on debut at The Oval, scored 20 of his 29 runs in boundaries.
But he was undone by a good length delivery from fast bowler Kagiso Rabada that seamed and took the edge, with de Kock holding an excellent diving catch in his right glove.
Root and Malan, looking for a big score after managing just 11 runs in total on his Test debut at The Oval, played out five successive maidens.
Fast bowler Morkel has not always got the rewards he's deserved so far this series, but he saw off Malan when the Middlesex left-hander, born in London but raised in South Africa, edged a drive to Proteas captain Faf du Plessis at second slip. Morkel had tea figures of one for 34 in 13 overs. - AFP

Spieth seeks youngest Career Slam, Rory hunts more Quail glory
Charlotte: Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth, fresh off a British Open triumph, can become the youngest golfer to complete the career Grand Slam with a victory in next week's PGA Championship.
The 24-year-old American could join Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Gene Sarazen on the select list of those who have won the Masters, US and British Opens and the PGA.
Winning next week would give Spieth, who captured the 2015 Masters and US Open, the Career Slam at 24 years and 17 days, breaking the age mark set by Woods, who was 24 years and 6 months when he won the 2000 British Open to complete his Career Slam.
But Spieth made it clear he's more concerned about his chances to complete the Slam over a lifetime than the youngest-ever opportunity that comes only next week.
"My focus isn't on completing the career grand slam," Spieth said. "My focus is on (winning) the PGA Championship.
"If I'm healthy and playing well, I'll play in 30 of them. I believe I'll have plenty of chances to win them. But it doesn't have to be this year. If it's this year and it happens, that's great, that's another life-long goal that we've then achieved.
"But I believe I'll do it someday, so if it happens next week, then fantastic, and if it doesn't, then it's not going to be a big-time bummer whatsoever because I know I have plenty of opportunities."
The year's final major showdown will be staged at Quail Hollow, which hosts a US PGA Tour event each May but skipped this season to prepare the 7,600-yard course to test the world's greatest players.
It's a course where Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy, seeking his fifth major triumph, has enjoyed great success. He won PGA Wells Fargo Championships at Quail Hollow in 2010 and 2015 and finished second in 2012.
"I'm excited to go back to Quail Hollow," McIlroy said. "It's one of those courses that I've had a lot of success on in the past. I've played well there basically every time I've went.
"But it's going to be different. We played Quail Hollow in May before. It's going to be August. It's a different grass. Obviously they've redone a couple of the holes and the layout is a little bit different. But I'm excited to get back."
McIlroy's major trophy haul includes the 2011 US Open, 2012 and 2014 PGA Championships and 2014 British Open. He has missed three tries at his own career Grand Slam at the Masters, taking fourth in 2015, sharing 10th in 2016 and seventh this year.
It will be a three-year major win drought if McIlroy doesn't take the title next week.
"I feel like I've been going for a fifth major for a long time," McIlroy said. "I think it's about time I stepped up and won one.
"(I) have a couple of Wanamaker trophies. It would be nice to make that a hat trick."
It will also be McIlroy's first major since splitting with long-time caddie J.P. Fitzgerald, who was with him for nine seasons and all four major triumphs.
"It's a big change. J.P. has been a huge part of my life," McIlroy said. "I got to the point where if I didn't play a good shot or if I made a wrong decision, I was getting more frustrated at him than I was at myself. I would much rather be angry at myself for making a wrong decision than being angry at him."
But McIlroy said rebounding from a horrid start at the British Open to share fourth has made a difference for him.
"I feel like I've started to turn a corner with how I played at the Open," McIlroy said. "I definitely feel like my game is going in the right direction."
The 99th PGA Championship also marks the 100th major start for two veteran stars, four-time major champion Ernie Els of South Africa and five-time major winner Phil Mickelson, the US left-hander who needs only a US Open to complete a Career Slam. For now, Spieth is on that list with Mickelson and 11 others to win only three of the four majors. He knows the next step to join Nicklaus, Woods, Player, Hogan and Sarazen is a huge one. "To be in that company, no doubt, is absolutely incredible and I certainly appreciate it," Spieth said. "But I'm very careful as to what that means going forward because what those guys have done has transcended the sport.
"In no way, shape or form do I think I'm anywhere near that, whatsoever. So it's a good start, but there is a long way to go." AFP

Sri Lanka, in dire need of a New Constitution
The former Finance Minister is not bending or yielding. Anybody concerned can go to courts. This Yahapalanaya has brought him before a powerful commission and he gave his answers; those concerned or the government as a whole can go on correcting the situation if that is necessary. Today, even at village level, people desire the truth and leaders to account.
The President took a tough decision, may be in the greater interest of the people, and he and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should decide now without delaying further. However decisions on crimes committed by fascistic elements are pending in courts of law. Firmly committed anti racists should have the right to demand to take him before the law before damaging his personality. This meant Yahapalanaya taking correct decisions in the greater interest of people.
People were anxious during the oil strike. Suffering of the poor was terrible. There were no trade union demands but so called patriotic demands put forward by the fascistic front. Several organisations of workers, fishermen and peasants commended the decision taken by President Sirisena to declare fuel distribution as an essential service when petroleum workers were on strike.
It is tragic that finally, after the military took over, the fuel distribution issue came to an end. TU leaders responsible, made a terrible mistake by yielding before deployment of army. They should not have started anti-poor action in the first place. Of course it shouldnt have been allowed to happen. The President used to consult all sides for the past couple of years. It has brought nothing much, but sudden anarchy.
Market economy
In a country where market economy is functioning; it is foolish to expect bourgeoisie to send their children to fight for a share in the free education basically meant for the not so wealthy. In Lanka already there are many private universities for other subjects such as engineering, accountancy, management etc. In this context it is crazy to claim that private medical college, SAITM should be demolished. Of course it should be up to the standard as estimated by the Medical Council.
Investors are responsible to put more money and resources for that purpose. Of course private investors expect a profit. However those can be regulated by the grants commission. Thus, it will be open for bright students with means or scholarships, but unable to enter the state medical faculties, as an option to pursue their medical studies. This is the solution offered by the President.
With these interventions many activists believe that the SLFP should stand together with the President if it is to form a government led by their party. They all should come under one leader. One minister said the President should be our leader. If we stand in the middle of the road, we would be knocked down by the vehicles moving from both sides. We should be on the side. He should be able to think on behalf of his party. Unless it is done, the SLFP would go from crisis to crisis. It would entail a series of defeats at the hands of the UNP.
There were decisions taken by the Finance Minister earlier on which were detrimental to the country. He introduced a Super Gain Tax. Though it was not implemented, it antagonized people against us. Then, a Capital Tax was proposed. It was not implemented too. Yet, it alienated local entrepreneurs from us. So now we know who were against the anti-capitalist proposals of Ravi Karunanayake!
Judicial independence
President Sirisena quit the previous rule as he could not stand corruption, as explained by himself. Of course there were other more criminal issues involving the Rajapaksas. Apparently he protested in all that. Ranil helped him to come out and people rallied behind him. They sought a government which is not burdened with corruption, but offers democracy and good governance.
Constitutional reforms, electoral reforms and judicial independence are all linked with the change expected. However removal of Executive Presidency and devolution of power put together was the main demand. During the first term, the President was able to do away with some of his Executive Powers considered draconian. Besides, he managed to get the 19th Amendment enacted making way for independent commissions to be set up.
Constitutional change

However people are expecting fundamental changes. President has not spelled out his proposal for constitutional change. Nevertheless he was able to build up Sri Lankas image in the international arena. As mentioned above, the controversy surrounding the Bond issue turned out to be the first affront to this government; with much publicity, it became so injurious to the government only a couple of months after its formation in 2015. Some claim that it caused a multi-billion rupee fraud to the country. Yet, the Yahapalana was elected not for the sole purpose of rooting out corruption, though it had to grapple with the same charges.
The President started with dealing with those responsible. He was supported by the Prime Minister. Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran was removed. After that, the Presidential Commission was appointed to look into the charges. Today, it is public knowledge that those responsible for mass scale corruption are exposed. The President said in a recent meeting that he had no way forward with corrupt elements. He vowed to form a government without corrupt elements.
No one has accused Ranil for corruption. So, this new Yahapalanaya could come out with the support of the UNP. It should happen, undoubtedly. President can consider the fact that Minister Tilak Marapana resigned from the Cabinet once because he was just accused of something. He was the lawyer retained in the Avant Guarde case by the defence.
This policy will be continued says the UNP General Secretary. There are accusations against prominent UNP leaders. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is accused of safeguarding these people. The UNP cannot remain mute in this regard. Obviously prominent politicians either from the UNP or the SLFP should make up their minds to go home if their names are tainted with corruption allegations.
In the meantime Mahinda claims that he could form majority in the parliament and form a government. Can he do that without the help of the President President already said that he will not help any corrupt person to come to power.
Hence Mahinda cannot say anything like that exactly. First, he has to secure a simple majority by getting 113 MPs on board. It is the second move to secure two-thirds. Currently, the UNP has 106 seats. SLFP front has 95. The JVP has six and the TNA with 16. There are contradictions and confusions within the pro SLFP front. On the other hand Parliament cannot be dissolved for four and-a-half years. If the President wants to form a new government he has to decide whether to form a government using the members in the present coalition or proceed to make a new political front within the parliament, with it as it is.
Mahinda group
On the other hand there was a dispute about the manner in which economic affairs were handled. The suggestion to form an economic council were both the President and the PM participate is a way out. Both have to find a solution to the economic problems. Two years have passed now; according to economic pandits it is a period that is long enough for a government to turn around the economy. It is true that Lankans have a debt burden.
Today, Mahinda group say the economy is collapsing with the rising cost of living and the unemployment rate. They are accusing Yahapalanaya for the debacle; but who is responsible for leading the country on such a downward spiral Of course one can blame the Mahinda regime, but this government is responsible to revive it. However, the greater problem is forming a constitution acceptable to all nationalities in the country. Except Mahinda group all are united for a democratic constitution that could satisfy all nationalities in the country. Hence we must together go forward.

Treasury Bond issue : commission to take Budapest Convention on Cybercrime into consideration

Sri Lanka has modeled its Computer Crimes Act (2007) according to the Budapest Cybercrime Convention.
Meanwhile, Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda told the PCoI that the Attorney General is objecting to the application made by Mahendran based on international practices followed by the US Justice Department and UK Metropolitan Police when a digital forensic examination is conducted.
Mahendrans lawyer Chanaka de Silva told the PCoI that he will provide best practices that argue otherwise to what the AG is basing their objection on.
The Treasury Bond Commission issued an order to former Governor of the Central Bank Arjun Mahendran to handover all his digital communication devices to the Criminal Investigation Department, on July 26, 2017. Subsequently to the order, Mahendran handed over his digital communication devices on the same day evening. The surrendered devices are currently kept under seal.
Mahendrans lawyer Chanaka de Silva sought permission from the PCoI, on July 28, 2017 to allow a representative be present when data is derived from Mahendrans mobile phone for the forensic digital examination.

Action taken against Rajapaksa, a blessing in disguise: MR
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said that action taken against the Rajapaksas had turned into a blessing.
Addressing the media at the Dharmapalaramaya in Mount Lavinia on Tuesday (01), he said the Yahapalanaya regime was inefficient in managing the country and addressing the issues of the general public and also immensely contributed to the failure of the Government.
Rajapaksa said, Everyone has a weakness. But what makes our regime stand out from the crowd is that we know how to handle our weaknesses better.
He also questioned the Government about relations between the sale of the Shangrila Hotel and the lands of the Hambantota Port.
The Former President said that he had introduced an act which prohibits the sale of countrys lands to foreign nations, while the Yahapalanaya regime had eliminated the practising of the act when they had established a government of their own.
Rajapaksa further said that the Shangrila Hotel was the first investment which had been made in Sri Lanka after the end of the war. He said, Actions taken against the Rajapaksas will be a blessing for us and it would help the general public in finding the truth.
