Influenza outbreak in South
Health Ministrys indolence caused public unrest
Public unrest had risen throughout the Southern Province owing to the indolence of the Health Ministry and its Epidemiology Unit in handling the rampant influenza virus which first broke out about six weeks ago, Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Karapitiya Teaching Hospital (KTH) branch Co-Secretary Dr. Kanchitha Samararathne alleged.
He was addressing a press conference convened in Galle, on Saturday. GMOA Karapitiya Teaching Hospital branch President Dr. Janath Liyanage, Co-Secretary Dr. Manjula Zoysa and General Committee Member Dr. Lahiru Sasanka also participated in the media briefing.
We had a number of consultations with paediatric consultants, paediatric surgeons and respiratory disease consultants over the matter. Majority of them confirmed that the dominant flu epidemic in the South was seasonal influenza
"Seasonal influenza was witnessed at the end of 2017 and beginning of 2018 in Australia, the UK and USA, which was comparable to the dominant influenza situation in the South. According to our observations, we understand that the current flu disease status and related complications are quite similar to the seasonal influenza that spread in the South during the corresponding previous periods of the year," Dr. Sasanka said.
"As per our scrutiny, the current flue disease cases were first reported from the Mirissa and Weligama areas in the Matara district, which are predominantly tourist regions. Hence, we believe that the virus may have originated from a foreigner hit with flu virus," he added.
At present, a large number of paediatric deaths have been caused due influenza and related aggravated complications and an increased number of influenza-positive patients are being treated at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital and other hospitals. We also understand that a large number of persons who are hit by the virus had taken treatment privately, without being admitted to government medical institutions," Dr. Sasanka further said.
"The most serious factor over the issue is that members of our medical staff, including consultants, doctors and nurses, have contacted the virus as well. This imposes a greater impediment to the proper functioning of the treatment of patients. As such, we insist Health authorities to take immediate steps in order to initiate a swift programme to administer medical staff of hospitals who treat patients, with flu vaccinations. It is the only precautionary measure that can be taken to protect the staff form contracting the virus," he said.
The effectiveness of the influenza vaccine can vary. However, recent studies show that flu vaccination reduces the risk of flu illness by between 40 to 60 percent among the population during flu seasons, a GMOA Co-secretary said.
"The current silent strategy maintained by Health authorities with regard to the rampant virus, would lead to the intensification of the disease up to a high-risk epidemic status. We urge them to carry out specific programmes to educate the public over the imminent epidemic conditions," he added.
GOMA KTH branch President and Paediatric Consultant Dr. Janath Liyanage, speaking at the media briefing, said influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It infects the nose, throat, and sometimes, the lungs, varying from mild to severe and could even lead to death.
The symptoms of influenza are mainly fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, muscle or body aches, headaches and fatigue. People who have the flu often feel some or all of these signs and symptoms usually start suddenly, not gradually, Liyanage added.
The flu viruses are spread mainly by droplets made when people with cough, sneeze or talk. These droplets can land on the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. A person might also contract flu by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth or nose, he said.
Hence, flu patients should use a suitable handkerchief or cover their mouths with their arms bent towards their faces. Always make it a point to stay at least two metres away from a sick person in order to avoid coming in contact with the virus, he added.
To avoid contracting the virus, people should avoid sick people and stay home if they are sick. It is also important to wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand wash. Linens, eating utensils and dishes belonging to those who are sick should not be shared without washing thoroughly first. Eating utensils can be washed either in a dishwasher or by hand with water and soap and do not require to be cleaned separately. Further, frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected at home, work and school, especially if someone is ill.
Young children under five years of age (Infants under two years are at high risk), people over 65 years of age, pregnant woman and people with certain chronic health conditions, immune-compromised persons, patients under steroid treatment and medical staff (as they are exposed to the virus in carrying out clinical services for patients), are at high risk of contracting serious flu complications.
"At the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, there are only two Paediatric Intensive Care Units and they are both overcrowded with patients at present. There are only seven Intensive Care Treatment beds in those units. Furthermore, there are only two pediatric Intensive Care consultants who have to work round the clock. Other children's wards are also crowded. Hence, authorities should take immediate measures to rectify the situation. If the matter is left unattended, it would result in more pediatric deaths," he said.
"We suggest authorities to reach out to more paediatric specialists from other hospitals and arrange to transfer surplus child patients to other hospitals in Colombo, Kandy and Anuradhapura, where there are advanced Paediatric Intensive Care facilities, he added.
The GMOA KTH branch had also prepared handouts educating the public over precautionary measures with regard to the widespread influenza virus in the Southern Province.

Mahinda Rajapaksa forgets his criticism of Army commanders
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who accuses the government of targeting war heroes, seems to have conveniently forgotten the manner in which he targeted commanders of the Army during his rule, Regional Development and Wildlife Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said.
The Minister said that one should preach to others by following such advice oneself.
Field Marshal Fonseka was speaking to the media after his maiden inspection tour of the Yala National Park in his capacity as Wildlife Minister, on May 21.
He observed that a Minister should make public statements in a responsible manner and said that he would guard his tongue whenever innuendos are levelled by others. Fonseka said there were allegations of illegal clearing being undertaken in the Nimalawa section in Yala. He said he would look into the matter and take necessary remedial action if warranted.
The Minister said most illegal activities were taking place due to a severe shortage of wildlife officers and he would take necessary action to rectify that problem. Steps would be taken soon to declare the elephant corridor in Hambantota as a state reserve though a gazette notification.
He said out of the five human deaths caused by elephant attacks recently, three had occurred because the people concerned had ventured into the reserve in an unauthorised manner. As such, a quick solution had to be found to the humanelephant conflict.

SAITM students transfer to KDU
Proposed act overpowers Higher Education, Health Ministries
The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) had sent a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena in connection with the proposed Sir John Kotelawala Defence University Act (drafted in 2017), SLMC sources said.
According to sources, the letter pointed out to the President that there was no need for a new act in order to solve the issue of SAITM students and that amending the current act was enough to solve the issue.
The proposed act establishes a separate higher education system in the country which is independent from the current system governed by the University Grants Commission (UGC).
The letter also highlighted that the new proposed act violates the key objective of the setting up of the KDU through 1988 No. 27 (amended) Act, which was aimed at providing professional training required for officials in the armed forces. But the proposed act offers medical degrees for any civilian without the approval of the SLMC, which is a must now, the sources said.
The letter said the new proposed act offers medical degrees that were not recognised by the SLMC. The new proposed act also allows any state body to obtain the affiliation of any foreign institution without obtaining the approval of relevant professional bodies such as SLMC, sources said.
The letter stated that the most unacceptable fact is that the said act would give power to the Defence Minister to overlook certain powers of the Higher Education Minister and the Health Minister, which would definitely lead to the militarisation of the higher education of Sri Lanka, sources added.

50 Greatest players in World Cup History
#32 Sepp Maier
It was the final of the 1974 World Cup. The Dutch were a fierce team back then, let me tell you. After taking apart a star-studded Brazil side, they were perhaps the favourites against the West Germans in the final. Because of how they played, you cant help but think there was a little bit of complacency after they took the lead when Johan Neeskens scored from the penalty spot in just the second minute of the final.
The West Germans found their way back into the game and scored from the penalty spot through Paul Breitner. The game was finely poised after that.
With the scores level, Netherlands had the chance to retake the lead before the second half. Johan Cruyff and Johnny Rep were in a 2v1 situation and the former found the latter with a nice pass. 1v1 with the goalkeeper. A calm finish is what most of the commentators and the pundits back then would have predicted.
Out came Die Katze von Anzing. The technique isnt something that youll see from the modern-day orthodox goalkeepers. He slid on one leg, almost like a defender, seemingly eliminating the prospect of Rep slipping it through his legs. He came out fast, giving Rep less time to think what he had to do. And his reflexes Well, they were that of a cat. Rep took the shot, Sepp Maier sprung out an arm to deny him and keep the scores at 1-1.
There was still plenty of time left in the game, more than a half. But Gerd Mullers exquisite finish, despite being off balance, sort of shell-shocked the Netherlands who were chasing the game from the 44th minute. They tried, but Maier was there to deny them every time. The full-time whistle blew with the scores at 2-1 and West Germany lifted the World Cup once again, their second time.
People tend to forget the contribution of Sepp Maier. A West Germany team bristling with stars like Berti Vogts, Franz Beckenbauer, Paul Breitner, Uli Hoeness and Gerd Muller still had their moments of lapse in concentration and thats where Maier came in. You get past the brick-wall that Beckenbauer and Hans-Georg Schwarzenbeck were, Maier was always there to deny opposition forwards with his cat-like reflexes.
Maier wasnt supposed to be a goalkeeper in the first place. While playing youth football for TSV Haar during his teenage days, Maier was an agile winger. Perhaps that was one of the reasons why he was so quick off the line. But his reflexes were something that came naturally to him. In fact, he was so good in keeping them out that despite conceding a ton of goals against Bayern in a youth cup game, Maier impressed Rudi Weiss who was working at the Bavarian FA back then. The rest, as they say, is history.
Maier retired in 1980, and that too because of a pretty unfortunate incident. A car accident in 1979 pretty much ended his career. Who knows how much longer he could have played He was still in his mid-30s.
The 60s and 70s had some legendary goalkeepers playing the game. Lev Yashins story gets told a lot, but Maier deserves his place in history. Having inspired a generation of world-class goalkeepers, the likes of Jens Lehmann, Oliver Kahn, Rene Adler, Manuel Neuer, Maier is undoubtedly a World Cup great.
A European Championship winner and a World Cup winner, it would be criminal not to include Maier in our list of 50 Greatest World Cup Players.  sk

I. M. R. Wijetunge
True gentleman
Ivor Malcolm Reginald Wijetunge was born on June 1, 1918, at Turret Road, (currently known as Srimath Anagarika Dharmapala Mawatha), Colombo 3. His father was Edmund Perera Wijetunge of Gandara Walawwa; C. B. E. Crown Proctor, J. P. U. M. Solicitor and Dondra Vishnu Devale Basnayake Nilame, while his mother was Lilian Adeline Winifred De Fonseka Pieris (granddaughter of Hannadige Jeronis Pieris and Warusahannadige Carolina Francisca Soysa). He spent his childhood with two brothers, Percival and Ronald and sister Mahanil at Browns Hill, Matara; a colonial residence built by his father in the early 1900s.
Educated at Royal College, Colombo, from 1928 to 1937, Ivor was an ardent philatelist, having one of the best stamp collections in Sri Lanka consisting of many rare first edition stamps. Ivor also engaged in playing table tennis and participated in athletics during his college days.
He read for his BA through the University of London External Programme from 1937 to 1941 and was called to the Bar on April 5, 1944, following the family tradition of practicing law as done by his father and brother Percival. He had a thriving practice at the Matara, Tangalle and Hambantota courts and also appeared before the Colombo Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court on Civil Matters.
He married Lois De Silva and was blessed with five children; Krishanthi, Samanthi, Sharmini, Rajiva and Newaree. Carrying on her fathers legacy, Krishanthi also chose law as her profession, achieving first place in the Attorney-At-Law Final Examination in 1977. She practised as an Attorney-At-Law and was a lecturer in the Law Faculty of the University of Colombo.
Ivor was appointed the first Presidents Counsel for the Southern Province on October 20, 1983; his proudest achievement. Having practiced at the Bar for a period of 49 years, he passed away on June 12, 1993.
As a way to honour Ivor and his legacy in the field of law, four of his grandchildren, Arvin, Shevanti (Shevy), Dilhara (Dilly) and Janani chose law as their profession. Other noteworthy lawyers in the family include Vernon Wijetunge QC, Justice Ninian Jayasuriya and Percival Wijetunge.
Grandpapa, as we all called him, was a true gentleman, a devout husband and father to his wife and children and doted on all his grandchildren equally. He selflessly gave his time to clients on a pro-bono basis and always had a patient ear for anyones problems. He would let me sit in during his consultations with clients during my younger days, which initated my love for law and the desire to be like him when I grew up. He was a great influence in the lives of his children and grandchildren and we all miss him dearly each and every day.
Granpappa, May you attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!

Prof. Samantha Hettiarachchi
Devout Buddhist
Just a month has passed by since the demise of Professor Samantha Hettiarachchi. Having been a pioneer in teaching coastal engineering in Sri Lanka both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, in the early 1980s, Professor Samantha Hettiarchchi carried out an extensive project on the behaviour of the Kalu ganga outfall, which traversed from one end of the sand bar to the other regularly, causing certain resistance to the rivers flow.
His observations were made known in one of his first research papers presented jointly with me in 1983 at the International Coastal Engineering Conference.
A past president of the Institution of Civil Engineers in London, on receiving the sad news, sent a message stating ...I see Sam as a young and energetic man with many years left in him. What a tragedy for Sri Lanka...
His interests and entry into the field of coastal engineering has been memorable, with its summit being him holding the position of Acting Vice Chairman of the Steering Group of the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System under the auspices of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).Samantha was a devout Buddhist, while respecting all other religions.
His late mother and wife were faithful Christians and he had a solid background in a leading Christian school by the sea, being its Head Prefect as well.
During the initial stages of his postgraduate Coastal Engineering career, he carried out a survey of the performance of the fisheries harbours around the island.
He had a liking for all sorts of fountain pens from various countries. A couple of years ago, when I complained about the difficulties I faced in finding a replacement for a matching silver-plated pencil, it did not take much time for him to get me an identical replacement which since then, I carry with me always; it serves as a remembrance of him. May he rest from his devoted invaluable contributions to the academic and professional fields and above all, to the development of youth.

Chandra Lal De Alwis
Excellent entrepreneur
I was saddened to learn of the passing away of Chandra Lal De Alwis, former Managing Director/CEO of Chemanex Ltd and one of the most successful entrepreneurs/technocrats that I had ever come across. Lal departed from the world, leaving a permanent void in the hearts of everyone associated with the rubber and chemical industries in Sri Lanka. His demise marks the end of an era of 40 years as a high-profile entrepreneur, encompassing the rubber and agro-based industry in the country.
My association with Lal commenced in the late 1970s, when the sole supplier of the bleaching agent namely RPA 3 that was used to make water-white latex crepe rubber, the Du Pont Company, a leading chemical manufacturer in USA, suddenly announced its withdrawal from the market owing to health and safety reasons. This announcement was a bolt which posed a threat to the rubber estates in the country who were the sole suppliers of this premium-grade rubber to the whole world. There was no alternate chemical available to be used for this purpose.
The Plantation Industries Minister at that time gave a deadline to scientists attached to the Rubber Research Institute (RRI), to discover an alternate chemical to be used for this purpose within three months. Even though this directive was an impossible task to be accomplished within three months, we the scientists of the RRI, took this challenge with a grit of determination and invented a chemical which is now available in the market to be used in the printing ink manufacturing industry, capable of bleaching pigments in rubber latex, thereby making the rubber produced a pure white colour.
However, this new product had inherent drawbacks at the time of its introduction to the market. It was available as a solution in petroleum oil and it also had an foul smell, exposing the workers handling the chemical to giddiness and other health hazards. According to the World Health Organisation, it was carcinogenic. Hence, the scientific community at the RRI worked to resolve this challenge and convert the new chemical to a water-soluble form, which was easy to handle and free of health hazards.
Lal De Alwis, who was the General Manager of Chemanex Ltd at the time, took a decision to help the RRI implement the new chemical to the crepe rubber industry, facing various challenges by the distributors of oil-based chemicals. Thanks to his efforts, the RRI was able to substitute this new safe chemical manufactured by Chemanex Ltd in the crepe industry, paving the way for the RRI to win the Institute of Chemistry Gold Medal in 1985 and later, the Presidential Award for Research.
He was a devout Buddhist who held numerous positions at temples and other social organisations. I had the privilege of learning the rudiments of facing challenges in marketing, thanks to the support and advice I received from him.
Lal was honest and also courageous and objective in his endeavours.
His death is an irreplaceable loss to the rubber industry and to all Sri Lankans as well.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana.

Kumari Rambodagalle
A wonderful individual
I came to know Kumari when our children went abroad for their studies. We met often and soon, became good friends. Kumari was a wonderful person; helpful and kind. she was a faithful wife to her husband, Upali and a loving mother to her two children Malinka and Savinki, who later became doctors.
When Kumari, on that fateful day, called me early morning to ask my son to book an angiogram for her, little did I know that it would be the last call I would receive from her.
I miss you very much.

Kusumsiri Gunawardena
She was courageous
I remember a person who had never changed her rightful decisions as her decisions were always rational. Where she saw injustice, she was rough as a storm; and before justice, she was a lioness. Not considering whether she would win a persons vote, she would be outspoken of her decisions, clearly justifying them in front of anyone.
Kusumsiri Gunawardena was born the youngest of eight children for Magalle Kachchiyawatte Sopinona and Don David Amarasinghe (who was a pioneer in civil contracts.
She had a warm and an understanding heart towards the poor. Kusumsiri was educated at Sri Rahula Buddhist School, but since it was considered as an incomplete education without English, her parents decided her to be educated at the Matara Convent. After four years, as her parents were not satisfied with her education, she was educated later at Musaeus College in Colombo.
Vivianne Gunawardena (niece of late Phillip Gunawardena) and Caroline (Sister of Phillip Gunawardena), were her schoolmates. The straightforward ideas of hers infused with the both of them and they were at in their senior years when the Buddhist nationalist agitation intensified; this was in the early 1930s.
Ex-serviceman Aelien Perera, encouraged by Terrance N. De Zylva who foresaw the invasion of the imperialists, set in motion a crusade to sell sooriyamal flowers in commemoration of the veterans who lost their lives in redeeming the country from its invaders, in opposition to the sale of poppy flowers as in western customs.
Young Kusuma, always seen with plaited hair and seated with a smart outlook, won the hearts of her friends as well as her teachers. Her brother Dr. C. D. Amarasinghe was responsible in her affairs with the passing away of her beloved father in 1920.
With the birth of the Sama Samaja Party in 1935, the three ladies Caroline, Kusuma and Vivianne were seen at anti-imperialist rallies. At most meetings, unlike Robert Gunawardena, Phillip Gunawardenas speeches were fiery and bright, with flares of power being one of the most powerful speakers in the countrys history. He, who spoke last at times, transformed the minds of the public.
On June 30, 1939, she took Phillip Gunawardenas hand, witnessed by Susantha de Fonseka and Dr. Colvin R. de Silva. She extended her fullest support to her husband in numerous ways, be it political, domestic or otherwise since then. On June 18, 1940, when Phillip Gunawardena along with Dr. N. M. Perera and the others, were incarcerated without trial or questioning for campaigning against the British, young Kusuma was a frequent visitor to the Weilikada Prison to encourage her husband.
When they broke out of jail and went into hiding in India, she too joined them, disguised as a student with Sam Silva by the Talaimannar train. They were arrested on July 15, 1943, by Indian Police and she was later deported to Sri Lanka with her eldest son Indika. Phillip Gunawardena, deprived of his seat at Avissawella due to an incident in Mount Lavinia, was sentenced to a six-month imprisonment.
In 1947, under the Soulbury government, Phillip Gunawardena lost seat in Parliament and Kusumsiri was elected to parliament. She was the first parliamentarian to deliver a speech in Sinhala. In 1952, she won the Avissawella seat and in 1956, while Phillip Gunawardena won the seat with over 22,000 votes, she won the Kiriella seat with over 9,000 votes against her opponent. In 1960, she lost her seat at Kiriella. Later, she gave up her political career after she lost in 1956, 1967 and 1970, while contesting for the Kolonnawa seat.
I could remember her strong image dressed always in a white saree. I believe as a mother, she brought up her children to an incompatible, rebellious migration for a precise, socialist environment. She was a sincere revolutionary who argued for just cause of the legitimate workers rights.
Though never advertised, she would always use all Sri Lankan products and prepare food with her own hands, sans aid from servants. She involved herself in politics and all home chores were handled by her herself. She possessed stormy and straightforward personality who opened herself to anyone genuinely.
This was my effort in making aware of her story in short to younger generations; to let them know who she was and the courageous heart and patriotic blood she possessed.
May she attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana!

Are potatoes good for you 
Theres no vegetable quite as versatile as the humble potato. Roasted. Mashed. Boiled. Fried. And thats before you get onto sweet potatoes and the various foods you can make with them both, like farls, dauphinoise, rostis, crisps
Every version is delicious and every version tastes completely different. And considering that about 40 percent of the Irish population used to be solely reliant on potatoes before the famine, itd follow that it is possible to live off them.
What nutrients do potatoes contain
Regular potatoes are actually pretty nutrition-dense. Theyre a good source of vitamin B6 (essential for maintaining a healthy nervous system) and potassium (helps maintain consistent blood pressure), as well as copper (helps with energy), vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, fibre and pantothenic acid  all crucial minerals and vitamins.
Sweet potatoes are super rich in vitamin A (a powerful antioxidant and a crucial nutrient for eyes, health, skin and brain function), vitamin B 1, 2 and 6, vitamin C, manganese, copper, pantothenic acid, potassium and fibre.
Are they all contained in the skin
The skin is super-nutrient densebut so is the flesh. They just contain different quantities of different nutrients. The skin of a baked potato, for example, contains around 115 and 27g of carbohydrates, while the flesh contains 145 calories and 34g of carbs. A whole baked potato has 66 percent of the recommended daily intake of vitamin B6, 31 percent of vitamin C and 19 percent of thiamin. The flesh contributes up to 70 percent of the total amount of all three.
The skin, meanwhile, is a rich source of iron (around 60 percent of the total).
Both are nutritious, its just that if you consider an equal amount of flesh and skin, youll find that the skin is more nutritionally dense. 100g of skins (around two potatoes) would contain five times more riboflavin, seven times the calcium, and 17 times more iron than the same amount of flesh. So if you keep binning the skin, you really are missing a trick.
Can you count them as part of your five-a-day
Despite being so rich in so many vitamins and minerals, potatoes dont actually count towards one of your five-a-day.
In fact, according to the NHS, neither do most starchy foods. Yams, cassava and plantain also dont count, and thats because they mainly contribute starch to our diet  theyre there to fill us up.
How many calories does a potato contain
One medium sized potato contains 110 calories, while one medium sweet potato weighs in at 180 calories. But that difference in calories doent have anything to do with how healthy either are; in fact, sweet potatoes are often touted as the more nutritious option.
Are they healthy
It depends on how theyre cooked. Both types of potato contain health-giving properties but if youre going to deep fry them before emptying half a salt cellar on them or smothering them in mayo, youre probably negating a lot of the benefits.
Chips contain around 312 calories and around 35g of fat per 100g; theyre delicious and good for the soul but no one seriously believes that theyre actively healthy.
White potatoes also have a high glycemic index, which means that they can cause our blood sugar levels to rapidly rise. We do actually need high GI foods in our diet (for instant energy) but you want to make sure that the majority of your carbs are low-GI.
Weirdly enough, sweet potatoes are naturally low-GI but become super high-GI when baked. So if you want to keep your sugar levels lower, boil them. Cooking them in the oven or pan essentially turn them into natures candy (which is why sweet potato fries are so delicious). Metro

Liquidity (in value terms)
The Banking, Finance & Insurance Sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 40.45% (or LKR 1.44Bn) of market turnover.

Point of view
Equity markets reversed last weeks temporary uptick, with relatively flat performance over most of the week failing to offset Mondays 24 point (or 0.40%) loss.
The broad-share Index recorded its biggest loss for the week on Monday (~26 points or 0.40%) and the ASPIs flat performance (total of 1.7 points) over the rest of the week resulted in the bourse falling ~24 points or 0.37% over the week to end at 6,467.80.
Returns on Sri Lankan equities over May has remained negative so far, with the ASPI losing 1.0% (~63 Points) Month to day following a gain of 0.8% in April. The YTD return on the Index consequently dropped to 0.9% as market returns over Q118 have been volatile, with gains in January (+1.7%) and February (+1.2%) trimmed by losses of 1.1% in Mar18 post the communal violence in early March.
Although the ASPI ended the week on a negative note, weekly activity levels improved, helping turnover levels increase ~35.6% W-o-W to Rs.3.6Bn cf. Rs.2.6Bn a week ago.
Stronger activity levels were driven primarily by HNI and institutional investors who showed renewed interest in Equities over the week; crossings subsequently, accounted for ~47% (1.7Bn) of the weeks turnover cf. ~29% last week and ~44% year to date weekly average.
RIL Property (320Mn) accounted for ~19% of the total crossing for the week and HNB accounted for 18% of total crossings while ACL, JKH and 10 other companies traded in large parcels over the week.
Foreign investor interest also appeared stronger over the week, with investors indicating a preference towards Sri Lankas relatively undervalued equities helping net foreign inflows of Rs.1.0Bn cf. outflows of Rs.0.5Bn last week.
Foreign investor interest appeared concentrated on midcaps such as RIL and banks such as HNB, but some outflows were evident from blue-chips such as JKH & Commercial Bank.
Despite LKR volatility, foreign investors have continued to channel funds into Sri Lankan equities for most of the year so far, as fiscal reforms and stable monetary policies along with Sri Lankas relatively undervalued market has continued to attract foreign investors and helped the YTD net foreign position on the CSE move to a net inflow position of 0.2Bn (cf. an outflow position of Rs.0.8Bn last week). Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from corporate earnings for the Mar18 quarter.
Inflation hits 2-year low
National inflation levels over Apr18 declined to a 2-year low, in line with urban inflation levels reported earlier in the month (April CCPI was 3.8% Y-o-Y cf. 4.2% Y-o-Y in March).
Headline NCPI fell to 1.6% Y-o-Y in April 18 (2.8% in Mar18), the lowest since Feb16 when it was recorded at 1.7%. Declines were driven mainly by the higher base during the same period last year as the flood and drought impact resulted in higher Food prices during April 2017.
Annual average NCPI also decreased over the month, falling to 6.1% from 6.7% in Mar18. On a month on month basis however, the NCPI increased 0.1%, due to higher non-food prices, mainly in Transport (following the fuel price increase by the LIOC) and Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco.
With the implementation of the market-based fuel-pricing mechanism (which will be revised every 2-months and which will be based on global oil prices) in May however, inflation levels are likely to edge higher over the year, particularly given the recent sharp increases in global fuel prices.
Nevertheless, the CBSL anticipates inflation stabilizing at mid-single digits after a brief supply-driven uptick in the short term on the back of the upward price revisions in domestic petroleum products, LP gas and milk powder.
According to the CBSL, these supply driven pressures are expected to be transitory and further improvements in domestic food supplies is expected to stabilize inflation at the desired mid-single digits by H218 and range between 4-6% over the medium term.

Attractive people less likely to get low paying jobs
Attractive people, believed to receive favourable treatment in the hiring process, may be at a disadvantage when applying for less desirable jobs, such as those with low pay or uninteresting work, a study suggests.
Researchers from London Business School in the UK conducted a series of four experiments involving more than 750 participants, including university students and managers who make hiring decisions in the real world.
Participants were shown profiles of two potential job candidates that included photos, one attractive and one unattractive (the photos were vetted by previous research to test attractiveness).
The participants were then asked a series of questions designed to measure their perceptions of the job candidates and, in three of the experiments, whether they would hire these candidates for a less-than-desirable job or a more desirable job.
In all three experiments where they were asked, participants were significantly less likely to hire the attractive candidate for the less desirable job and more likely to hire the attractive candidate for the more desirable job.
We found that participants perceived attractive individuals to feel more entitled to good outcomes than unattractive individuals, and that attractive individuals were predicted to be less satisfied with an undesirable job than an unattractive person, said Margaret Lee, a doctoral candidate at the London Business School.
In the selection decision for an undesirable job, decision makers were more likely to choose the unattractive individual over the attractive individual. We found this effect to occur even with hiring managers, said Lee, lead author of the study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.
The findings were surprising because, based on prior research, the prediction would be that decision makers select the attractive candidate no matter the position, she added.
The most interesting part of our findings is that decision makers take into consideration others assumed aspirations in their decisions, said Madan Pillutla, from London Business School.
Because participants thought that attractive individuals would want better outcomes, and therefore participants predicted that attractive individuals would be less satisfied, they reversed their discrimination pattern and favoured unattractive candidates when selecting for a less desirable job, said Pillutla.
This research suggests that the taken-for-granted view that attractive candidates are favoured when applying for jobs might be limited to high-level jobs that were the predominant focus of past research, according to Pillutla.
Therefore, organisations and policymakers may need to implement different measures from those assumed by past work if they are to curb discrimination in the hiring process, he said.

Bales brilliance, Karius errors give Real third straight European triumph
KIEV, Saturday - A sensational overhead strike from Real Madrid substitute Gareth Bale and two calamitous errors by Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius gave the Spanish side a third straight Champions League title with a 3-1 win in an incident-packed final on Saturday.
Welshman Bale came on just past the hour with the score at 1-1 and after three minutes produced an astonishing bicycle kick finish and then netted with a speculative long-range effort that somehow went through the hands of the unfortunate Karius.
The German keeper had earlier handed Real a 51st minute lead when he threw the ball straight at striker Karim Benzema and the ball rolled into the unguarded net off the Frenchmans leg.
Great emotions. To lift three Champions League trophies with this club, this team is magnificent, said Reals Zinedine Zidane, who became the first coach to win Europes top trophy in three consecutive years. We dont quite realise what we have achieved yet. We are going to enjoy the moment. 
Liverpool, who crucially lost their leading scorer Mohamed Salah to a suspected dislocated shoulder in the 31st minute, had equalised in the 55th minute when Sadio Mane found the net from close range after Dejan Lovren headed the ball into the area.
In truth, though, despite their best efforts Liverpool never looked as much of a threat once Egyptian international Salah went down under a challenge from Real captain Sergio Ramos.
We started well and played exactly like we wanted to, said Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp, who has now lost his last six finals as a coach.
The situation with Sergio Ramos (and Salah) looked really bad and it was a shock for the team, we lost the positive momentum and they immediately came up, he said.
It was a night which confirmed Reals ability to superbly manage the biggest of games.
Bale, who has not been first-choice at Real this season and whose future has been the subject of much speculation, was man of the match while 24-year-old Karius ended the night in tears as he lay flat out on the turf of the NSC Olympic Stadium.
Real have become the first team since Bayern Munich in 1976 to win Europes elite club trophy three years in a row. The Spaniards won five straight European Cup trophies in the 1950s.
DESERVED TRIUMPH
Reals fourth Champions League triumph in five years, and 13th European Cup success in total, was fully deserved despite Liverpool, the competitions top scorers this season, making an aggressive start to the game in an electric atmosphere.
The English side attacked with intent and Trent Alexander-Arnold tested Navas with a low drive but Real looked in charge following the departure, in tears, of Salah.
Real had their own injury blow with right-back Dani Carvajal having to go off, replaced by Nacho in the 37th, and ended the half with Benzemas effort being disallowed for offside after Cristiano Ronaldos header was saved by Karius.
France striker Benzema was to get compensation though when he was alert to Kariuss ill-advised attempt to throw the ball out quickly, although Reals lead lasted just four minutes.
Liverpools Senegal forward Mane was sharp to react when Lovren rose to head the ball goalwards and their travelling fans sensed the Anfield sides spirit could turn the game around.
But then came Bale, leaping to produce a jaw-dropping left-foot overhead volley from Marcelos cross before trying his luck with a speculative long-range shot that defied Kariuss ham-fisted attempt to keep it out and put the result beyond doubt.
In between Liverpools Senegal forward Mane hit the post from the edge of the area as Liverpool, lacking their usual attacking potency in the absence of Salah, continued to battle.
Ronaldo, who now has five Champions League winners medals, could have added a fourth goal for Real near the end but the Portugal forward was distracted as he burst goalwards when a fan ran onto the pitch before being stopped by security. This time it was Bale who had grabbed all the headlines as Real and Zidane continued their continental dominance.  Agencies

Beautiful Bonsai
Bonsai trees are awesome. Just ask Mr Miyagi of The Karate Kid. They look beautiful, they fit in your house, they encourage patience and dedication, they relieve stress, and they help to purify the air. Whats not to like
People have been caring for Bonsai trees for over a thousand years. The ancient horticultural practice originated in China, where it was known as penzai, and was later redeveloped under the influence of Japanese Zen Buddhism. The plants are kept small due to growth-restricting techniques such as pinching buds, pruning and wiring branches and restricting the use of fertilizer. Its a delicate and time-consuming process.

CEB strengthens Maintenance Management Process with ACECAM
Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is the leading state owned organization in using Computerized Maintenance Management Solution (CMMS) for utility management in Sri Lanka with its solution partner Acecam (Pvt) Ltd.
CEB continues the journey of improving their entire maintenance management process by implementing TOMMS which is a computerized maintenance management software (CMMS) for its critical asset management in a staggered approach based on the asset concentration.
Transmission division, holder of over 60 grid stations, high tension electric lines etc. spread across the country commenced automating the maintenance management process in grand scale with a project kick-off meeting on April 3, 2018 at Moven-pick hotel with the participation of senior officials of CEB and its solution provider Acecam (Pvt).
According to a senior officer of Transmission Asset Maintenance Division, gone are the days of using traditional methods to keep track of our maintenance program. Hereafter we are planning to store a wealth of information about each asset, including information about warranties, manufacturers, catalogs, vendor details and expenses in a single software which provides us a high traceability and minimize probable human errors in practicing asset maintenance routines.
Addressing the gathering another senior officer of Transmission Division said that after implementing TOMMS CMMS, our team can make correct decisions on assets and its maintenance aspects being on-site or off-site through seamless access to the asset related information via the web. We want to make informed decisions on our assets quickly to minimize unnecessary expenses, delays in the processes and improve service quality.
According to Ruwan Manchanayake, Director at Acecam, TOMMS CMMS is an excellent tool useful for the companies that are extremely dependent on the operational state of their equipment, especially in the fields of Manufacturing, Power and Energy, Marine and Offshore, Construction, Transportation ans Highways, Irrigation and Water Management, Hospital and Healthcare, Hotel and Leisure Management, Facility Management etc. TOMMS CMMS makes it possible for both the operational and strategic level staff of CEB to collaborate in defining, controlling and managing maintenance tasks pertaining to their assets.

CEBEU to intensify trade union action
The Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union (CEBEU) has threatened to intensify their ongoing work-to-rule strike action by refraining from attending to breakdowns or other issues after office hours from next week.
We have so far had several rounds of discussions with the government. Two main demands among them, the approval of the Long Term Generation Plan and the appointment of competent professionals to the Public Utilities Commission remains unresolved, it read.
In light of the failure on the government to make its move, the Union had met on May 25 and decided to call for a special General Meeting this week. There is a possibility of reaching a decision, where we would not attend to any breakdowns after office hours and on holidays under any circumstances.
The unions adds that the PUCSLs refusal to approve the Generation Plan since 2015 and the failure to construct new power plants has dragged the country as well as the power sector into crisis.
The CEBEU met President Maithripala Sirisena last week. CEBEU member Athula Wanniarachchi told the Daily News that they had conveyed their concerns and the President had said he would take necessary action. According to the engineers who attended the meeting, the President has sought advice from the Attorney General over the ongoing dilemma.
According to the PUCSL, the Least Cost Long Term Generation Plan 2018-37 was approved under the least cost principals in Section 43 of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act No. 20 of 2009 to ensure energy security and continuous supply of electricity in Sri Lanka.
The Transmission Licensee (CEB) was directed to commence the procurement process as per the provisions of the law for the new plants within the period 2018- 2028 to avoid power shortage. Therefore, no new coal power plants were approved exterior of the approved plan.

Chopras century helps Essex beat Somerset for second victory
LONDON, Friday - Essex opener Varun Chopra compiled his one-day best 160 to help his side to their second One-Day Cup win in four games against Somerset at Chelmsford.
The cornerstone of Essexs total of 313 was the 141-run fourth-wicket stand Chopra shared with Ravi Bopara (73). Roelof van der Merwe (61 off 54 balls) and Peter Trego (50) both hit half centuries, while Tom Banton made 40.
But Somerset fell short, being bowled out for 273 to lose by 40 runs, Shane Snater taking a List A best 5-60. Zimbabwe-born Netherland international Snaters efforts came on his home debut, in only his second game for Essex, having gone for 38 runs off just 4.2 overs in the six-wicket defeat by Hampshire on Wednesday.
Chopras innings has been bettered by only one other batsman in the competition so far this season, Yorkshires Tom Kohler-Cadmore, who made 164 against Durham a week ago.
Only five Essex batsmen, record holder Bopara (201*), Graham Gooch (three times), current captain Ryan ten Doeschate, Ken Mcewan and Nasser Hussain have scored more in an innings for the county in 55 years of limited-over cricket.
Paul Stirling hit his second One-Day Cup century of the summer as Middlesex beat Sussex by 74 runs at Hove.
The Ireland batsman made 116, despite needing a runner because of a thigh problem, as Middlesex posted 288-4. He shared an opening stand of 198 with Nick Gubbins (86) so their total was lower than they might have expected.
Sussex, though, lost wickets regularly in their reply and although David Wiese made 57 Ravi Patel took 4-54, as they were all out for 214 in the 44th over. The win was Middlesexs third in a row after beginning the group stage of the competition with defeat by Essex.
Kent captain Joe Denly starred with bat and ball as they earned their first One-Day Cup win of the summer by beating Glamorgan by four wickets.
Denly hit 17 fours and two sixes in an imperious Kent record 150 not out off 143 balls, sharing a stand of 88 with Alex Blake (41) as they reached 278-6. Nick Selman anchored Glamorgans innings with a career-best 92 off 125 balls in a total of 274. But Denlys leg-spin claimed key wickets as he finished with 4-56.
Glamorgan are now effectively out of contention for the knockout stages after four successive defeats.
Derbyshire beat Leicestershire by five runs after a thrilling finish to a rain-affected One-Day Cup contest.
With the match reduced to 33 overs a side after bad weather in Derby, Billy Godlemans 64 and 49 from Gary Wilson helped the hosts to 211-9.
Leicestershires reply started well at 58-0, but regular wickets left them needing 38 from the last two overs. Two fours and two sixes from Tom Wells (49 not out) took the game to the final ball, but they fell short on 206-7.
Wells needed to hit his third six in the over from the last delivery, but Ravi Rampaul bowled a dot ball to win it for the home side.
Durham beat Worcestershire by nine runs via the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method, despite earlier totalling only 209 in 45.2 overs at Gosforth.
The hosts had been well set on 55-1, but the loss of opener Cameron Steel for 18 sparked a collapse. Only Michael Richardsons 64 and 48 from Gareth Harte guided them beyond 200, with Charlie Morris taking 4-33.
Worcestershire recovered from 40-4 to 82-4 before the rain arrived - but they were nine runs short on the DLS method.

Three-wheeler issuing tickets
Now the authorities have compelled by law the three-wheeler owners to issue tickets for the fare paid. This seems to be absurd. What is required are meters for them as unfair fares are being charged.
Though metered ones have increased some jugglery would have done to them by our talented garage fellows. If a tampered meter is detected a fine of Rs. 50,000 should be imposed so as to be a lesson to others.
Further, the amount appears in the meter could well be seen by a passenger. The passenger will not be paying more and the kilometres travelled is no concern for him or her.
Lastly, so many ministers had handled the Transport Ministry for so many years and none of them was able to put into practice the issuing of tickets in private buses. Still, it continues and at a situation like this coercing the three-wheeler drivers to issue tickets is an act of a bird brain.

Contractor payment assurance legislature soon
The Ministry of Finance has commenced drafting legislation with regard to a proposal made by the Minister of Housing and Construction Sajith Premadasa to the government for the introduction of payment guarantee for construction contracts.
Minister Premadasa speaking at the recently held Build Sri Lanka - 2018 Housing and Construction Exhibition, organized by the Chamber of Construction Industry Sri Lanka (CCI), revealed that he would be submitting another proposal before the government for ensuring good governance in the construction industry through equitable payment procedures.
The Minister noted that much has been done to strengthen the industry and facilitate the industry stakeholders over the last three years.
One of our foremost achievements was the promulgation of national construction industry policy which provides a coherent approach and a shared vision for all stakeholders in the industry to move forward.
Complementing the national policy, several rules and regulations under the Construction Industry Development Authority (CIDA) Act has already been gazetted.
According to the minister, several other rules and regulations are also to be published in the near future and the government has granted approval to his proposal for the drafting of the much-needed and much clamored amendments to the CIDA Act.

Cooking With Pather Panchali
The Bengali novel Pather Panchali, Song of the Road is best known in the West as a Satyajit Ray film but the 1929s classic is also one of the most popular titles from prolific Indian author Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay (18941950). It chronicles the lives of two poor children in rural India.
The great animating spirit of this beloved book is that, despite their poverty, the childrens experience is one of abundance. Every path in the village is beloved to Durga, the elder sister, she had known them all her life, so naturally and intimately that they had become a part of herthey were her own dear friends, her lifelong companions.
Delicious dinners
Though Durga and her brother Opu are often hungry, their lives are a paradise of guava and mangosteen and custard apple trees, simple but delicious dinners made by mummy, and festival treats and feasts. On a day when Durga makes a picnic of dal, rice and eggplant snuck from her mothers stores, Opu reflects, To think that they were out together sitting under a date-palm tree with leaves from a custard apple tree lying like a carpet all around them, and that it was real rice and real vegetables that they were eating! How wonderful it all was!
Every bite these two take seems to be bursting with flavor, and small things like the quest for ingredients to make a mango pickle with oil, salt and chili become major plot points.
Indian cuisine is one of my favorites to cook at home, and my two cookbooks from Julie Sahni are some of the grimiest and most water-warped on my shelves. (Alas, I am not a neat cook.) Versions of almost everything the children eat in the novel can be found in Sahnis books, which often specify the regional origins of the recipes, and include many from Bengal.
I found a recipe for a Bengali home-made cheese-curd dessert called ras gulla, which was like one Opu covets as an inaccessible treat for rich people. There was also a recipe for the mango pickle, something I would never have tried, but which turned out to be a bright, delicious dish, worth stealing mangoes for, as Durga frequently did. I cook Sahnis dals frequently, so included one for Bengali red dal, and made velvet shrimp and eggplant raita, since the children eat those ingredients in the novel.
Spice-perfumed
Seafood dishes in general are specialties of Bengal. Even some of Pather Panchalis cooking techniques are endorsed in Sahnis cookbook. Shorbojoya, the mother in the novel, places her spices within easy reach of her right hand when cookingwhich was just how Sahni instructed me to make the dals spice-perfumed butter.
Either because of my love of Indian food, or because the children in the book were so desperate for yummy things to eat, I found this menu very difficult to limit, and ended up making six dishes, topping off all of the above with puffy fried poori bread, called luchis in Bengal. Or, as Opu says, luchis! Luchis! Made by the best cook in the village in a huge pan, swimming with butter and filling the air with ambrosial odours of frying luchis!

Cristiano Ronaldos future casts cloud over Reals historic treble
KIEV: Cristiano Ronaldo cast a shadow over Real Madrids third consecutive Champions League triumph by suggesting he could have played his last game for the Spanish giants in Saturdays 3-1 win over Liverpool in Kiev.
Ronaldo, 33, has now won five European Cups in all, but failed to score in a fourth final as Gareth Bale was the hero for Real after coming off the bench to score twice.
I am going to enjoy this moment and in the next few days I will give an answer to the fans, who have always been at my side, Ronaldo told BeIN Sports Spain.
It was very nice to be at Real Madrid. In the next few days I will speak. Ronaldo later admitted his immediate post-match comments had been ill-timed.
It wasnt the perfect time. I dont want to take away any credit from what Madrid have done. To win three consecutive Champions Leagues is a unique moment, he added.
Personal situations are not important at this moment. Ronaldos comments appeared to target Real president Florentino Perez for a lack of support.
However, Perez hinted he was tired of Ronaldos intimations he could leave.
It isnt the first time Ronaldo, who joined Real from Manchester United for a then-world record fee in 2009, has appeared close to the exit door at the Santiago Bernabeu.
In 2012 he claimed to be sad in Madrid, and, even after securing a first European Cup and La Liga double for Madrid in 59 years last season, Ronaldo was also reportedly looking to leave.
Then, it was for what he perceived as a lack of support from the club over an ongoing tax investigation into the management of his image rights from the Spanish authorities. Ronaldo himself said this week of speculation over who might arrive at Real: They always speak about 50 players and in the end no one comes.
Here the most important thing is the club, and the most important thing is that we are celebrating this Champions League, Perez told Antena3. AFP

Currency depreciation poses risk to APAC emerging markets - Moodys
Moodys Investors Service says that the currency depreciation witnessed across Asia Pacific in recent months poses risks to the regions emerging and frontier markets. Sovereigns with high external financing needs are most exposed.
Most currencies in APAC have depreciated against the US dollar this year, with the largest depreciations in the key Asian emerging markets of India (Baa2 stable), Indonesia (Baa2 stable) and the Philippines (Baa2 stable).
In Indonesia and the Philippines, currency pressure will exacerbate already weak debt-affordability metrics. If associated with capital outflows, tighter financing conditions will have wider repercussions for the balance of payments. says Anushka Shah, a Moodys Vice President and Senior Analyst.
By contrast, Indias low dependence on foreign currency to fund debt burdens limits the risk of a weaker currency transmitting into weaker debt affordability. adds Ms Shah.
Moodys conclusions are contained in its just-released report Sovereigns -- Asia Pacific: Currency depreciation will weigh on sovereigns with high external funding needs.
Moodys points out that the extent of depreciation seen this year has been less pronounced than during the taper tantrum in 2013. Also, ahead of the recent financial market volatility, most large emerging markets in APAC have accumulated sizeable reserve buffers, affording some policy space. The credit implications are more negative for countries with high external financing needs. This includes the frontier markets of Pakistan (B3 stable), Mongolia (B3 stable) and Maldives (B2 stable).
Countries with large current account deficits are particularly vulnerable to a prolonged rise in risk aversion which could see capital outflows that leave them with lower foreign reserve positions. Sovereigns with high external debt obligations relative to their foreign reserves, such as Sri Lanka (B1 negative) and Mongolia, are also particularly at risk.

## Title: The day Ceylon became a republic
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Monday, May 28, 2018 - 01:00
The day Ceylon became a republic
May 22 should be a solemnizing day to the nations history that was the day the Ceylon became independent Republic of Sri Lanka. Until then, the legal authority of the monarch controlled the governmental activities of the then Ceylon.
0n February 4, 1948, British Government transferred the power to newly dominion of Ceylon. The Governor of Ceylon Sir Andrew Caldecott sent good news to the Board of Ministers in May 1943 promising that a commission would be appointed to examine a complete constitutional scheme towards granting a fully responsible government to Ceylon.
The State Council headed by DS Senanayake drafted a constitutional scheme and presented to Governor on February 2, 1944. Based on that ministerial draft, the king in council approved the new constitution on May 15 in 1946. Afterwards Ceylon (Constitutional) order in Council 1946, Ceylon (Constitutional) (Amendment) order in Council 1947, Ceylon (Constitution) (Amendment No.2) Order in Council 1947, Ceylon (Constitution) (Amendment No.3) Order in Council 1947, presented to the UK Parliament and finally Ceylon Independence Order in Council 1947, was made by the king in order to remove the responsibility of UK Government which continued under Soulbury Constitution. This is how the Ceylon became to dominion status in 1948.
Since then Sri Lanka was a Commonwealth realm. The Office of the Governor also changed as Governor General until the Constitution of 1972 established on May 22, 1972. The Queen of England remained the nominal head of the executive.
New Constitution
The victory of united fronts in elections held in 1970 paved the path to the Republic Constitution of Sri Lanka. Prior to the election of 1970, the united front signed a common programme. The parties comprised were the Lanka Samasamaja Party (LSSP), and the Communist Party. The electoral mandate of the United Front in May 1970, was as follows,
We seek your mandate to permit the members of parliament you elect to function simultaneously as a Constituent Assembly to draft, adopt and operate a new Constitution. This Constitution will declare Ceylon to be a free, sovereign and Independent Republic pledged to realize the objectives of a socialist democracy: and it will also secure fundamental rights and freedoms of all citizens.
After coming to the power at the election, the united front introduced a bill of parliament to abolish the Senate. On October 2, 1971, the royal assent was received to the Ceylon (Constitution and Independent) Amendment Act o.36 of 191 and Senate was abolished after 23 years.
Dr. Colvin R de Silva, the mastermind of the1972 Constitution, described the process as laying a new foundation for a new building, which people of this country could occupy. (M J A Cooray (1982) Judicial Role under the Constitution of Ceylon/Sri Lanka)
The Constitutional Assembly drafted the Republican Constitution and promulgated on May 22, 1972. There were many debates regarding the legality of the Constitutional Assembly. In creating a home-grown constitution, countries have been followed by different types of tactics. As like those countries Sri Lanka also followed a unique way to draft the new republic constitution.
The members of the Constitutional Council were representatives of people. They met for the first time at Navarangahala not as the members of the house but as the representatives of the people summoned to draft and proclaim a constitution. At the first meeting, the Prime Minister said, in the name of the people in Sri Lanka, I have called upon you as members of the House of Representatives to assemble here today.we have met in order to constitute, declare and proclaim ourselves the Constitutional Assembly of the people in Sri Lanka to adopt, enact and establish a constitution.
National State Assembly
The main components of the constitution were the National State Assembly, the President as nominal head and a Cabinet of ministers headed by the Prime Minister responsible to the National State Assembly. Willam Gopallawa served as the last Governor General of Ceylon and became the first non-executive President in Sri Lanka.
Two salient features underscore the transition from a dominion to a Republican Constitution namely the principle of autochthony and the doctrine of the supremacy of parliament (V K Nanayakkara, in search of a new Sri Lankan Constitution).
Section 3 of the Constitution stated that the Sovereignty of the Republic of Sri Lanka was in the people and was inalienable. Another important feature was the chapter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. Although there was no procedure for enforcement, a safeguard was the very first attempt at providing a wider and clearer Fundamental Rights Guarantee.
The chapter v of the Constitution mentions the objectives of the republic as safeguard the independence sovereignty, national unity, territorial integrity, and elimination of economic and social disparities and the democratization of the administration. Accordingly, objectives of the state policy are also included in the constitution.
The 1972 Republic Constitution of Sri Lanka is a constitution embodied the indigenous values of the country. Chapter II of the Constitution is headed as Buddhism. It states as the Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the state to protect and foster Buddhism while assuring to all religions the rights granted by section 18(1) (d). The idea of a secular state was abandoned by the 1972 Republican Constitution.
Therefore May 22 is a remarkable day for Sri Lankans. It should be understood that the way of being solely independent was a result of a long journey with many hazards.

Dayasiris dilemma
Kurunegala District SLFP MP Dayasiri Jayasekera, in trying to justify his acceptance of Rs. one million from Walter & Row Associates, owned by Perpetual Treasuries, of which Arjun Aloysius is the main stakeholder, has, in the process, left many questions unanswered. Jayasekera, together with 16 other SLFP MPs, quit the Yahapalanya Government, the other day, following the abortive No Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Their raison detre for doing so was the alleged involvement of Premier Wickremesinghe in the Treasury Bond matter. Of the 16, Jayasekera was the most vociferous in insisting that Wickremesinghe steps down. He, together with his colleagues, claimed that they could not sit in the same Cabinet with an individual who was tainted.
This selfsame Dayasiri Jayasekera, though, thought nothing of accepting Rs. one million from the same source, who, according to Jayasekera and Co, committed daylight robbery by siphoning off Rs. 12 billion from the Central Bank and was the main cause of the NCM against the PM.
Making a statement in parliament, Jayasekera took great pains to explain that it was the done thing for businessmen to contribute to the campaign fund of politicians during elections and his was not a case in isolation. Jayasekera also says that he has a business relationship with Aloysius.
Well, 2015 was not the only election the MP faced. Hence, this cannot be the only occasion that Jayasekera was the recipient of Aloysiuss largess. Jayasekera himself will admit that this expose came by pure accident. He was also the North Western Province Chief Minister and could not have had any compunction of availing himself of the generosity of Aloysius, and, indeed, other businessmen. Jayasekera, in trying to wriggle himself from a bad situation has shot his foot and put it in his mouth. He says that although he received the cheque from Walter & Row Associates he could not remember whether it was signed by Aloysius. What difference did it make Aloysiuss link with the firm is only all too well known
Jayasekera also says that he received this cheque during the 2015 General Election campaign and it was dated July 13. This was the time that news of the two alleged Bond scams was very much in the public domain and when members of the Joint Opposition were going to town with it. Yet, Jayasekera, who took moral high ground and wanted Premier Wickremesinghe to step down over the alleged bond scam thought nothing of accepting Rs. one million for his election campaign from the same source whose name was widely bandied about in connection with the Central Bank robbery. Does Jayasekera want the public to believe that he was completely in the dark as to Aoysiouss role in the scam when he (Jayasekera) accepted the money at a time his colleagues in the Joint Opposition were hammering away making it the chief election issue The first scam is said to have taken place in February and the other in April and Jayasekera receives the cheque in July. In the intervening period, all hell broke loose with the likes of Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila talking of nothing else other than the maha benku mankollaya, committed by Arjun Aloysius. What is more, Jayasekera himself was making common cause with their lot and also chaired press conferences to denounce Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. Yet, accepting Rs. one million from Aloysius was par for the course for Jayasekera, while the former was being exposed.
The height of hypocrisy was yet to come when Jayasekera left the government unwilling to sit in the Cabinet with a tainted Prime Minister. The MP owes an explanation to the public as to why he chose to remain silent about receiving Rs. one million from Aloysius after the latters link with the alleged Treasury Bond scam was virtually an open secret.
Dayasiri Jayasekera was one of those who was breathing fire and brimstone finding fault with Ravi Karunanayake for having Aloysius pay his apartment rent which was also Rs.one million (per month). One fails to see the difference in Jayasekera accepting Rs. one million and Karunanayake availing himself of the largess of the same source. Those in glasshouses should not throw stones.
Jayasekera also, with nonchalance, says that he himself did not cash Alysiuss check personally and that it was done by a third party at a bank in Kurunegala. By this Jayasekera creates the impression that Rs. one million was not that big a sum for him to have it cashed himself and even if the cheque had gone missing it was of no consequence to him. Jayasekera, indeed, may have accumulated a vast amount of money during his election campaign, curtsy businessmen, to treat a sum as large as Rs. one million with such disdain.
Jayasekera, now that he has been badly exposed, should apologize to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for painting the latter black with regard to the Central Bank Bond issue while all the time concealing his own connection with the party responsible, and, what is more, benefiting from him.

Disruption of daily rhythms linked to mental health problems
People who experience disrupted 24-hour cycles of rest and activity are more likely to have mood disorders, lower levels of happiness and greater feelings of loneliness, research suggests.
While the study does not reveal whether disruptions to circadian rhythms are a cause of mental health problems, a result of them or some mixture of the two, the authors say the findings highlight the importance of how we balance rest and activity.
Because people have these 24-hour patterns of living nowadays and because by 2050 two-thirds of the worlds population will live in cities where circadian disruption is much more likely, it is quite a big public health issue. How do we take account of our natural patterns of rest and activity and how do we design cities or jobs to protect peoples mental health said Daniel Smith, professor of psychiatry at the University of Glasgow and lead author of the research.
Writing in the journal Lancet Psychiatry, a team of researchers from Scotland, Ireland and Sweden report how they carried out the largest study of its kind to date by harnessing data from the UK BioBank, a research endeavour that has collected health information on 500,000 participants, aged between 37 and 73, since 2006.
To explore the link between mental health and the 24-hour cycles of sleep and activity known as circadian rhythms, the team looked at data from more than 91,000 participants who had worn a wrist-based activity tracker for a week at some point between 2013 and 2015.
[It collects] 100 movement data points in three dimensions per second over a seven [day] period, said Smith.
The team then looked at how active individuals were on average during their most active 10 hours each day compared to their least active five hours to calculate a figure known as the relative amplitude.
What that tells us is about the inconsistency or the disruption in the regularity of the routine of rest and activity, said Smith. People who are active during the day and sleep well at night, that is a very healthy profile ... they would have a high score in relative amplitude. Whereas people who tend to be disturbed in their sleep, are up a couple of times in the night and conversely tend to be not very active during the day, they score low in relative amplitude.
The researchers then looked at the results from questionnaires completed by the participants when they signed up as a participant to the UK Biobank that probed factors including loneliness, reaction times and neuroticism, as well as participants responses to a later questionnaire probing whether they had ever had depression or bipolar disorder. While not all participants who wore a tracker answered all questions, the team say the sample is large enough to unpick links.
Participants were then divided into five groups of almost equal size, based on their relative amplitude, and the results analysed.
The findings reveal that once factors including age, sex, season during which the tracker was worn, socioeconomic status, smoking status and experience of childhood trauma were taken into account, a low relative amplitude appeared to be linked to poorer mental health.
On moving from one group to the next lowest for relative amplitude, the team found among other results that the odds of loneliness increased by 9%, and ever having had depression or bipolar disorder by 6% and 11% respectively. Meanwhile, measures of happiness and health satisfaction dropped, and reaction times became slower.
While Smith admitted the figures were small, he said they were noteworthy. This is important because it seems to be across the board, he said, so it is a very consistent finding for these negative mental health and cognitive outcomes. Smith added that it was striking that the link remained even when so many factors were taken into account.
However, the study had limitations, including that the activity data was only collected during one week, and at a different time to the questionnaire data, and that it did not look at teenagers  an important time of life both in terms of mental health and the body clock.
Smith recommended avoiding activities after about 10pm that could disrupt the circadian rhythm, such as using mobile phones or getting up to make a drink.
Those subjects who appeared not to be much more active in the day than at night, and thus more likely to have problems, were people who have very poor sleep hygiene, people on their mobile phones at midnight checking Facebook or getting up to make a cup of tea in the middle of the night, he told the Times.
However he added that what people do during the day is also important, saying they should try to remain active during daylight hours and inactive at night. Especially in the winter, making sure you get out in the morning in the fresh air is just as important in getting a good nights sleep as not being on your mobile phone.
Dr Paul Kelley of the Open University welcomed the study, saying its findings added to a growing body of research linking circadian rhythms and mental health. But, he added, it was important to note that body clocks differ between individuals, meaning flexibility is important in both the workplace and schools. There is no timing that is optimal for everyone, he said.

EDEX Nenapahana assists Diggalpura Junior School
Royal College EDEX- Nenapahana team which is engaged in educational books and equipment donation programmes to needy schools in the country recently donated a large stock of school books and library books to Diggalpura Kanishta Vidyalaya, a remote school in Kavuduluwewam, Medirigiriya in the Polonnaruwa District.
This is the first occasion the EDEX team, headed by Chairman Mahinda Galagedara made arrangements to dispatch the school books and other educational equipment to a school by train from Colombo Fort Railway Station to Hingurakgoda Railway Station in order to fulfill the schools dire requirement in a very short duration.
The EDEX Nenapahana team was compelled to make the donation as early as possible after an urgent message received from the school Principal N. I. Elpitiya regarding the dire necessity of school and library books considering the economic situation of nearly 250 children studying in the school.
In addition Principal Elpitiya also requested the EDEX management to provide them with a photo copy machine which is also immensely important for teachers to have printouts of question papers.
Making a brief speech, Principal Elpitiya highly commended the EDEX Nenapahana team for their kind gesture and said that around 250 children studying in the school up to grade five classes with limited resources.
He also highlighted that one Grade five student passed the Grade five scholarship examination in 2017 with 180 marks and eight other students received pass marks with available resources.
Representing the staff teacher Malkanthi said if no photocopy machine is received by school from a donor she would make arrangements to purchase one prior to her retirement in July 2019.
EDEX Chairman, Mahinda Galagedara said the parents of students are farmers who live with basic facilities and their cultivations depend on rain fall. Sometimes their crops get destroyed due to prevailing droughts.
He said the Nenapahana Committee has so far upgraded 110 schools in 20 districts since 2013 and wish to continue the service even in future and request donors to contribute towards this worthy cause.

Elephant House Go Sugar Free range launched
Sri Lankas own Elephant House Beverages has introduced Sugar Free versions of several local favourites under its new, Go Sugar Free initiative.
Sugar Free versions of the beloved Elephant House Cream Soda, EGB, Necto and Orange Crush are currently available at supermarkets and grocers island-wide.
Further, this new range is being launched with a call to action to customers to move towards a healthier lifestyle. In fact, the Go Sugar Free logo builds on the use of the colour green, with its emphasis on healthy alternatives, as well as showcasing two arrows tied to the idea of moving forward.
Additionally, these arrows purposefully use increasingly lighter shades, subtly depicting beverages becoming healthier. The branding and design still encompasses existing brand personalities and elements of the Elephant House Beverage brands, to absorb the equity of the companys larger than life, award winning brands.
Most importantly, the Go Sugar Free range offers up the same iconic Elephant House soft drink flavours and taste but with no added sugar. This is thanks to the innovative research and development carried out in Elephant Houses own laboratories by some of Sri Lankas best food scientists. This was also followed up by stringent testing by multiple consumer panels to ensure that the original taste of Elephant House soft drinks was maintained throughout, and that these beverages will continue to be well received locally.
In order to achieve the same taste and flavour profile of its legendary beverages, Elephant House Go Sugar Free products contain Stevia, a natural, plant-based sweetener. Therefore, fans will not have to sacrifice on flavour or taste, instead continue to enjoy the same great Elephant House soft drinks that are well loved by generation upon generation of Sri Lankans.
Elephant House is currently expanding its product portfolio by offering more and more choices to consumers. The Go Sugar Free initiative is another key milestone of that journey. In the recent past, Elephant House has also launched several healthier beverage options, from FitOFruit drinks, toTwistee Iced Tea, F5 isotonic sports drinks and most recently the re-launch of Elephant House flavoured Milk, said Belindra Weerasinghe, Category Head of Elephant House Beverages & Vice President - John Keells Holdings.

The fascinating journey of Mohammad Abbas
From a factory worker to representing Pakistan at Lords
Two things that bind India and Pakistan quite closely is the riveting political history and their undying love for the gentlemans game. This love is what paves a way to some exhilarating and soul-stirring stories which shall remain alive for an eternity and continue to inspire the generations to come.
One such story is of Mohammad Abbas, who right now is ripping the English batting lineup apart at the Mecca of Cricket, Lords. The fast bowler is now enjoying a life where hes able to do what he loves, but it took a lot of sweating for him to get to this stage.
Born on 10 March 1990 in a small village named Jethi of district Sambrial (Sialkot, Punjab), the early days of his life were not very joyous. But the lad grew up watching some of the greatest fast bowlers of all time like Glenn McGrath and Shaun Pollock and saw them as an inspiration to bowl fast.
His early education and baby steps in cricket took place in Jethi. The more he started learning about the game, his desire to don the Green jersey for Pakistan escalated rapidly. But he had some other family responsibilities to fulfill as well and his road to becoming a cricketer was not an easy path.
STARTED WORKING IN A WELDING AND LEATHER FACTORY
Abbas was the eldest son and at a very young age, he was expected to earn bread for his family. He didnt shy away from that and started working in a welding and leather factory. An incredible performance in the Quaid e Azam trophy at this point in time made him contemplate leaving the country to take the game more seriously, but he prioritized his family.
He also worked for registering properties at the court for a couple of years. But then, life always throws a lemon at you at an unexpected juncture. His career started taking an interesting turn when he got an opportunity to play for the district U19 side. His lawyer friends didnt allow him initially to participate in that tournament as his age was well above 19, but eventually, he participated and made his mark.
It took him a lot of time to break into the Pakistan International side, but with his exploits at the domestic levels, he wasnt knocking the selectors doors, he was breaking them open. At the age of 27, he made his Test debut against West Indies and is now a crucial member of the side. Talking about how he approaches the game, he said It does not really matter how the cricket is, you still will have to put in efforts. While I am bowling, I steer clear of the batsmans weaknesses and strengths which make it easier for me to oust my opposition. It really was a topsy-turvy ride for Mohammad Abbas towards quenching his thirst to play for Pakistan. But as he said above, ones efforts always will reciprocate in a good way, maybe not the way we expect it to.  Crictracker

Fitch affirms Citibank N.A - Colombo Branch at AAA(lka); outlook stable
Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed Citibank N.A. - Colombo Branchs (CitiSL) National Long-Term Rating at AAA(lka). The outlook is stable.
CitiSLs rating is at the highest end on the National Rating scale and reflects the credit profile and financial strength of its head office - Citibank, N.A. (A+/Stable/ a).
It also reflects Fitchs expectation of continued strong support from the head office as CitiSL is a branch of Citibank, N.A. and forms part of the same legal entity.
The relatively small size of the branch (less than 1% of the total assets of Citibank, N.A.) implies that support, if any, would not be material to the head office. Citibank, N.A.s Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is higher than Sri Lankas Long-Term Local- and Foreign-Currency IDRs of B+/Stable and as a result CitiSLs rating on the National Rating scale is mapped to AAA(lka).
Fitch believes that support from Citibank, N.A. would be forthcoming if required, subject to any regulatory constraints on remitting money into Sri Lanka. The high probability of support is underpinned by CitiSLs strong operational integration with Citigroup through the use of common systems and regular reporting. The branchs strategic objectives are also aligned with those of the group.

Fulham back in Premier League with playoff win over Villa
LONDON, Saturday- Fulham returned to the Premier League after a four-year absence as Tom Cairney scored the winner in a 1-0 victory over Aston Villa in the Championship playoff final at Wembley on Saturday, the richest game in world football.
Cairneys first-half goal was decisive as Fulham, owned by U.S. billionaire Shahid Khan, held on to their narrow lead despite having defender Denis Odoi sent off after 70 minutes as tempers began to fray on a sultry afternoon.
The win secures the west London club a windfall of at least 160 million pounds ($212.91 million) as they look forward to joining Championship title winners Wolverhampton Wanderers and second-placed Cardiff City in the top flight next season.
Fulham, who failed to claim automatic promotion when losing to Birmingham City on the final day of the regular season as they finished third in the table, celebrated with their joyous fans as they sealed a lucrative place among the elite.
After we missed out on promotion (in the playoffs) last season, a lot of people wrote us off. We got a lot of stick. But football won today. Football was the winner, Cairney said.
With the stakes so high it was no surprise that the match was a frenetic affair in the opening stages.
Fulham, whose style of play under Serbian manager Slavisa Jokanovic earned plaudits this season, were the first to settle and scored from the games first piece of quality football.
Teenager Ryan Sessegnon received the ball midway inside Villas half, evaded a tackle, and turned to play a through ball that Cairney calmly slotted past keeper Sam Johnstone.
Villa, led by former England and Chelsea defender John Terry, were dreadful in the first half but they revived after the break.
Jack Grealish suddenly got involved in the game and he forced a save from goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli after a superb slaloming dribble through the Fulham defence.
Villa also had a penalty appeal turned down but Grealish was lucky to escape a red card with a reckless tackle on Cairney.
Odois clumsy attempt to win the ball off Grealish earned him a second yellow card and left Fulham to survive the last 20 minutes and five minutes of stoppage time with 10 men.
Villa threw everything forward in the nail-biting closing stages but Fulham held on without too many alarms.
Defeat ended Villa manager Steve Bruces hopes of a record fifth promotion to Englands top flight.
According to the Deloitte Sports Business Group, the playoff winners are guaranteed 160 million pounds, potentially rising to 280 million if they avoid relegation next season.
Fulham will earn 95 million pounds next term, as part of the Premier Leagues huge broadcasting rights deal, and up to 75 million pounds in parachute payments in 2019-20 and 2020-21 should they fail to stay up.  Agencies

Guidelines to conduct from the sidelines!
Everyone attends a sporting event hoping to enjoy the skills and dexterity displayed by the competitors as well as to have a good time. They take pleasure in appreciating the finer moves in the game and to witness the memorable moments of brilliance that often occur inside the arena.
Obviously, we all want to observe our favourite teams come out on top and encourage them with heartening cheers. Who doesnt like going to a live sporting event The anticipation, the crowd, and the frenzy of the sport all provide an indescribable thrill to the senses.
Regrettably, there are some people who attend a sporting event and are a disturbing influence on their fellow spectators while engaged in all kinds of rude and disorderly behaviour. Sporting events are a venue for fans to enjoy themselves, relax and have fun while cheering their favourite team. However, they should never become a setting for over-emotional morons to engage in reprehensible behaviour.
And remember to mind your language. There will inevitably be women and children around you. Going overboard and getting crudely and hysterically demonstrative is just not on. That is because such behaviour can spark confrontation and become downright dangerous.
No one has to remind you that mouthing obscenities in public is nothing short of being offensive. Even though the atmosphere may be charged with finger-biting tension there is no excuse for throwing things on to the field or yelling filthy invective at the opposing players or the umpires and referees.
Hurling objects on to the field of play is a criminal offence and can land you in jail. A free spirited air and loud celebratory spectator reaction permissible in certain sports such as soccer, rugby or cricket goes against the rules in many other competitive games which call for absolute silence. Crowds can influence a match by cheering their team on.
This helps create a carnival atmosphere in games such as cricket, rugby or soccer. Besides, it adds to the excitement as well and inspires the players
However, there are certain sports where extreme concentration is absolutely essential and obligatory. These include sporting events such as golf tourneys, tennis matches and billiards or snooker competitions where spectator silence is compulsory.
Be aware of the correct spectator appreciation at all times. For instance any form of distraction is frowned upon at tennis matches. Leaving your seat in the middle of a point can severely distract a player as well as those around you. Similarly, when returning to your seat you should either wait till a point is over or on the completion of a game. Some competitions will only allow you to leave your seat or return to it on the changeover of ends.
Never walk around the field while play is in progress. During a cricket match for instance you can impair the concentration and judgement of a batsman while strolling across the sightscreen. By doing so, through either ignorance or an uncaring attitude, can hold the game up interminably.
Worse still are the pitch invaders who love to call attention to themselves by disrupting the game while in progress. They are invariably apprehended by security and frogmarched out of the venue by security. And thank heavens there are no mad streakers in this neck of the woods.
Always keep in mind that referees and umpires are only human and could err under excitement and pressure. Avoid being downright spiteful or rude if you disagree with a call or play. You can of course cheer until you are blue in the face when your team is ahead. But make sure your loudness does not disturb fellow spectators following the play.
Another sad aspect is when the emphasis on winning gets out of control particularly when over-enthusiastic parents become aggressive in their quest for their progeny being number one. Recent events have shown that parents have become increasingly hostile at youth sporting events. Parental pressure to perform better can cause devastating psychological damage to young minds.
Yes, parents are pushing their children too far when it comes to both team and individual sports. Mostly these fanatical fathers pressurise their children to perform for their own personal gratification rather than for the team or the player.
This certainly causes parents to become overly competitive and often aggressive in their attempts to win at any cost. In short, the kids are forced to play adult versions of games to satisfy an adult thirst for experiencing what they watch on television.
Some of the most hilarious comedy cameos are witnessed from the sidelines and not in the arena where the action is taking place. It happens when some silly panjandrum offers his inexperienced tips to the players on how to make a winning play or move. Such inane actions often give people some comic relief from the seriousness of the game while the self-appointed coach is viewed as an attention-grabbing joker.
Remember there is good reason why you are in the stands and not on the playing field. No matter how inadequate a player or coach appears to be, in your estimation, he is a darn side better than you are. That is why he is in the thick of the action and you are in the stands. Consider that bad sportsmanship from the stands leaves a bad taste all round. This type of dreadful behaviour does nothing to glorify the event but rather serves to denigrate the sport and reduce the venue into an arena of infamy for the most shameful and embarrassing fan moments in sports history.
Never resort to horsing around or engaging in rough and tumble behaviour that could become obnoxious and may cause a violent reaction among those around you. Do not become a nuisance to others or cast rude remarks at opposing fans. If some idiot actually is spoiling for a fight ignore him. Never retaliate verbally or physically. If the intimidation continues and the guy does not back off simply call for security. And never trade punches with an opposing group of fans .To watch grown men fighting when their teams are in action amounts to nothing less than hooliganism and is certainly one of the saddest spectacles in any sport.

President tells officials
Ignore circulars when attending to emergencies
Government circulars should not be considered an obstacle for public officials when they reach out to help and assist people affected by the recent floods and other inclement weather conditions, President Maithripalaa Sirisena said.
The President emphasised this at a meeting he presided at the Mahawewa Divisional Secretariat during an inspection tour of flood relief activities in the Chilaw area on May 26 afternoon.
The meeting was attended by political representatives and public officials in the area.
The President who advised public officials to continue with the welfare activities launched for the benefit of affected families asked them to pursue rescue operations systematically with the assistance of the Armed Forces.
The President who said relief activities were undertaken in two stages, added that the government would act in a very responsible manner to provide relief during the calamity, as well as to provide welfare activities during the post disaster period.
The President also directed officials to launch a special relief programme to assist government pensioners and the lower rungs of government servants affected by the disaster situation.
At this meeting, people in the area explained the damage caused to their livelihoods during the disaster and requested that they be given easy financial credit to rebuild their livelihoods.
President Sirisena who gave a patient hearing to the woes expressed by the people directed the relevant officials to submit a report containing information about the matters raised.
The President who highly appreciated the mission undertaken by Public Officials and the Security Forces to provide relief to the affected expressed his deepest sympathies regarding the death of a Police Constable engaged in the humanitarian mission of saving flood affected people.
The President also directed officials to take urgent steps to cater to the welfare of the family of the Police Constable concerned.
The President later inspected the Medagoda bridge which had subsided with the floods and said steps would be taken to rebuild the bridge.
The President who also listened to the grievances of the people in the area later visited the relief camp at the Nattandiya Sri Pushparama Viharaya and looked into the needs and shortcomings of the distressed people accommodated there. Nearly 250 people belonging to 40 displaced families are accommodated at this relief camp and the President also had an interaction with them.

Its wet and hot
We have experienced pouring rain in some parts of the country and drinking water shortages in other parts simultaneously. This article takes a 360% view of issues and options.
Sri Lanka has a total land area of 65,610 km2. Thirty species of marine mammals in monsoon scrub jungle in the northwest and southeast, monsoon forest and grassland, inter monsoon forest, rain forests and grasslands below 3,000 feet, between 3,000-5,000 feet and above 5,000 feet. 4% of the countrys land area is covered by water, 103 distinct natural rivers and over 10,000 man-made lakes and canals countrywide.
We have 21 Acts, Ordinances and other forms of Enactments for development, allocation, regulation, usage and management of water resources, soil and forest conservation.
Water
Water sources for our main rivers are above 5,000 feet where forest cover is reducing. Downstream water retention is poor, flowing into the sea. Trapping water requires reservoirs.
Our rain fall has not decreased but occurs for shorter periods with longer droughts increasing consumption by 1.5. Sri Lanka does not have ground water mapping system done for most of the rich aquifers in the country, with planners and developers in dark. About 75%-85% of the developed water is withdrawn for irrigation with more than half of the water diverted for agriculture not reaching farms due to conveyance losses. Inappropriate application methods and poor on farm management practices wastes further, contributing to water logging, salinity and low productivity.
Power generation - Most of the natural flow sites for hydropower have been fully developed, changing the flow domain of the rivers spatially and temporally, impacting habitats, forest, wild life and loss of fertile land. Thermally modified return flows from power plants changes river life and flow regime downstream, causing damages to ecosystem and flora fauna, changing the climatic and land use pattern in the catchments area with adverse effects in the future.
Measures for water security
Reviewing, revising and reinforcing legislations already in place providing irrigation facilities, water supply, power generation, support for industries and environmental protection to maximize the water use efficiency, effectiveness and reliability, developing a comprehensive watershed management mechanism to enhance and ensure the water bearing capacity of both surface and subsurface aquifers, tanks, lakes and ponds, developing policy guidelines for improved erosion control, catchment protection and restoring by forest covers and wetlands, regulating withdrawals from surface and sub-surface storages within the permissible limits that the aquifer could provide, regulating pollution control mechanism.
Sri Lanka has an abundance of wealth in the Institutions addressing Biodiversity Conservation and climate change issues in Ministries, Line Agencies, Government Corporations, Private Sector, INGOs, NGOs and others.
We have knowledge, institutions and options. Its also true we are not doing enough. The issues highlighted have also become a source for leisurely projects, foreign trips, consultancies, reports, meetings and a whole lot more of hot air. A cynical exploitation of serious issues affecting the country.

Key solutions
Every country has relevant experiences to share and new things to learn. Co-operation between countries in the Global South is playing a growing role in generating and sharing new ideas, knowledge, and technologies, and investment, and is greatly valued by developing countries in areas such as;
* Reducing the impact of sea level rise
* Mitigating the possibility of flooding due to intense rainfall
* Strengthening our food supply resilience as climate change could cause crop failure and supply disruptions
* Leveraging Science and Technology to address National needs- Nations of the world are facing a common challenge - to convert an economy sustained by carbon-intensive energy sources, to one based on low-carbon, sustainable sources of energy.
* Supporting and translating research outputs into energy, water and land solutions.
Energy transformation and innovation on a national scale cannot be realised without the efforts of all stakeholders, and a clear long-term vision and strategy for the government, private sector and academic must be worked out and for us to work together at it.
Enhanced energy efficiency will play a key role in our efforts to manage emissions. We should promote the adoption of more efficient industrial and power generation technologies, and encourage the use of more energy efficient buildings, transportation, and household appliances.

Italian President to appoint non-political Prime Minister

Italy's President said Sunday he will appoint a technocratic, or non-political, Prime Minster after the designated choice declined to form a government.
President Sergio Mattarella and the Prime Minister-designate, Giuseppe Conte, met to discuss the forming of a government.
Conte, a law professor and political novice, was tappedby the country's populist parties last week to become Prime Minister and lead a new coalition government.
But Mattarella told reporters after their meeting Sunday that he objected to Conte's choice for the Economic Ministry.
He said Conte's candidate, Paolo Savona, was unacceptable because the appointment would alarm investors and have dangerous consequences for Italy's outstanding government debt.
Mattarella has not said who he'll name technocratic Prime Minister. He plans to meet Monday with Carlo Cottarelli, former director of fiscal affairs at the International Monetary Fund.
Mattarella said the country is heading for new elections.
"Nobody can say that I have put obstacles to the so-called government of the change," he said, but, "I need to take care of the savings of the Italian people."
Novice Conte emerged last week
Conte emerged as the frontrunner last Monday as Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini, the League leader, met separately with Mattarella at Quirinal Palace.
Negotiations had been underway since the country went to the polls in March. The anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) won the most votes, followed by the right-wing North League.
Di Maio and Salvini, the 45-year-old head of the League, had been locked in coalition talks after alliances with mainstream parties did not materialize.
Populists have ditched some of their most incendiary campaign vows, such as calling for a referendum on whether Italy should abandon the euro or leave the European Union.
Now, they are promising a spending and tax-cutting binge that has rattled investors and could contain the seeds of a new European crisis.
A populist government in Rome could make it more difficult for European Union leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to push further EU political and economic integration.

The book of poetry I wrote on behalf of your love came to an end without me knowing so, (Nodanima Awasan Wuna) sings Kasun Kalhara, a bestselling contemporary singer, to the tender and expressive melody by music composer Mahesh Vithana. Well known for his melodic revolt in the song Anna Sargewuna Mahesh Vithana takes on a contrastingly opposite direction with the music he composes for Kasuns single Nodanima Awasan Wuna.
Most significantly, Vithanas excellent composition of music has elevated the lyrics by Duminda Handapangoda, turning the song into a jewel to be sung by Kasun, who is a singer credited for having a deeply expressive voice. The absence of musical clichs and the freshness of music make Vithanas music composition stands out from the all too common music that dominates the listeners taste.
An award winner at State Music Awards Festival in 2015, Visharada Mahesh Vithana has produced music for popular singers in the industry including Deepika Priyadarshani, Dayan Witharana and Amal Perera. Vithana is presently employed as an officer attached to the government sector.

A 40-year-old father of two was arrested by the Aranayake Police on the night of May 24 with a stock of live ammunition used for automatic weapons and handguns, a part of a firearm and a stock of spent cartridges, following a tip-off.
Police said the suspect, Koswatte Ralalage Chaminda Bandara Koswatte, a resident of Wattegedara, had hidden the stock in an abandoned house in a scrub jungle in Wattegedara. Investigations revealed that he is a technician.
Police wished to ascertain whether he manufactured firearms locally. On interrogation, he confessed that the ammunition had been brought home, from time to time, by his brother who was serving in the Army. His brother, however, had gone missing in 2000, while in the Army.
The suspect was produced before Mawanella District Judge and Magistrate L.K. Mahinda Liyanagama on May 26 and was remanded till June 5.

New progressive leftist alliance underway: Lakshman Yapa
The first of the island-wide public forums titled Hurdha Sakshiye Nidahasa (Freedom of Conscience) organised by the 16 Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members of parliament who quit the national government and opted to sit in the Opposition on May 8, was held at Uyanwatta in Matara, last Saturday (26).
We hope to form a new progressive leftist alliance and nominate someone acceptable by all as its candidate for the next Presidential election, former Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said.
The sixteen of us decided to leave the national government last September as we realised that the country was deteriorating as neither the members of the SLFP nor the United National Party (UNP) nor any other citizens were secure. We were compelled to postpone our decision because President Maithripala Sirisena requested us to stay with the government at least until December, 2017. We knew in advance that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would win the No-Confidence Motion against him. But staying true to our conscience, we voted in favor of it, he added.
The 16 SLFP MPs who joined the ranks of the Opposition on May 8, were Susil Premajayantha, Dayasiri Jayasekara, Dilan Perera, John Seneviratne, Lakshman Wasantha Perera, Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle, Tharanath Basnayake, Susantha Punchinilame, Anura Yapa, S.B.Dissanayake, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, Chandima Weerakkody, Anuradha Jayaratne, Sumedha Jayasena, T. B. Ekanayake and Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala. Fourteen of the 16 MPs except Anura Yapa and T. B. Ekanayaka, were in Matara last Saturday. They paid homage to the sacred Matara Bhodiya and received the blessings of the Maha Sangha before walking across to the Uyanwatta stadium.
Former Minister Susil Premajayantha said that the policies as well as the expectations of the members of the SLFP and the UNP, were different even though they agreed to form a national government for a period of two years. He said that as it was the SLFP that insisted that a Presidential Commission be appointed to investigate the Central Bank bond issue, every SLFP MP should have voted in favor of the No-Confidence Motion brought against the PM. He also briefly spoke on a 20-point policy drawn up by the group, to guide the country to self-sufficiency and economic prosperity.
Former Minister S. B. Dissanayake said that their attempts taken to persuade President Sirisena and former President Rajapaksa to contest the last general election as well as the local government election by forming a common alliance, had failed. He also blamed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for all the hardships the people were facing at present.
Former Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said that it was because of the SLFP's representation in Cabinet that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was unable to do as he pleased and had to either withdraw or amend many Cabinet proposals such as the Port City Agreement and the Hambantota Port Deal, which were not in the best interest of the nation.
Badulla District MP Dilan Perera, who was the last speaker of the day, said that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party could never be destroyed, evident by all previous failed attempts.
This union between the SLFP and the UNP will never bear results. The 16 of us have only one mission in mind and that is to loosen the noose which is throttling the nation, rather than covering things up, he said.
Ratnapura District MP John Seneviratne, Professors Gamini Samaranayaka and Professor Methsiri Jayathilake also spoke.

North, South Korean leaders hold surprise meeting
KOREA: The leaders of North and South Korea held a surprise meeting on Saturday, their second in a month, two days after US President Donald Trump abruptly canceled a summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in met for two hours at the Demilitarized Zone, the South Korean presidency said in a statement.
The two exchanged their opinions on among other things successfully carrying out a future US-North Korea summit, according to the statement.
On Thursday, Trump called off a June 12 summit with Kim in Singapore but then told reporters Friday hes still open to a conference.
Moon, who has been a mediator between Trump and Kim, called an emergency meeting in the middle of the night after Trump called off the June summit in a letter to Kim.
Saturdays meeting at the DMZ followed a daylong summit last month in which Moon and Kim embraced, planted a tree and talked alone for more than 30 minutes. In April, the leaders also signed a declaration that commits the two countries to denuclearization and talks to bring a formal end to the 65-year-old conflict. It was the first time leaders from the two countries had met in 10 years.
In separate speeches last month, Kim and Moon promised a new era.
Addressing the worlds media live on television for the first time, Kim said the Koreas will be reunited as one country. Moon said: There will not be any more war on the Korean Peninsula.
A final peace deal for the two Koreas must also involve China and the United States, both of whom were participants in the original conflict that began in 1950 when the North invaded the South. An armistice was signed in 1953, but no formal peace treaty was ever concluded, and technically, the peninsula remains at war. - CNN

Not just about books
For years, the British Council Colombo Library has challenged the traditional perception of a library. While being home to the best selection of books and learning resources in Colombo the venue is also well known as a gathering space for artists, thinkers and thought leaders. On Sunday 3 June, the British Council Library will reopen as a space that embodies this role it plays as both a repository of knowledge and convener of people and ideas. To celebrate, an open day will present an exciting programme of events that capture the librarys vibe- It all happens here!
The British Council is the UKs international organisation for cultural relations and education opportunities. In Sri Lanka, they have been active for almost seven decades in the spaces of English language education, education and society, and the arts. The British Council Library is an extension of its commitment to these three pillars; with over 25,000 Sri Lankan members and centres in Colombo, Kandy and Jaffna, the library is an institution. In addition to the usual resources, members have access to an online library with over 14,000 e-journals and over 119,000 e-books on various subjects, states the British Council in a press release.
With the refurbishment, the British Council Colombo Library builds on this convening capacity. The young learner area will be bigger, with more space for stretching out with a good book or poring over a magazine. An instrumental area with a piano will serve some light entertainment.
On June 3, its open day at the library- inclusive of a book club discussion, a story telling session and drama workshop for kids, art therapy for adults, monologues, acoustic performances, and even an open mic session. Drop by between 10 am and 8 pm on Sunday 3 June to catch the programme; and dont forget- it all happens here. -NA

Now that the Summit is off, whats next
President Donald Trumps decision to cancel a June 12 summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un is only the latest development in a yearlong relationship that has run hot and cold.
I was very much looking forward to being there with you, Trump wrote in a letter to Kim on Thursday that toggled between amicable and menacing. Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting.
In the aftermath, here are six things to consider about the decision.
1. Why did Trump cancel the summit
The cancellation comes after days of heated rhetoric between the two countries over the question of North Koreas full and immediate nuclear disarmament and comparisons U.S. administration officials have made to the Libya model. In 2003, the George W. Bush administration persuaded Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi to give up its small nuclear programme. Eight years later, rebels backed by NATO air power deposed Qaddafi and beat him to death  a cautionary tale for Pyongyang.
This week, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said North Korea would go the way of Libya if the two sides failed to reach a deal. A Kim aide responded with a statement calling Pence a political dummy. Even Trumps cordial letter  every word of which he dictated, according to a White House official  included a menacing note: You talk about nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used.
Speaking with reporters on Thursday, a White House official said that North Korean diplomats stood up White House officials who had travelled to Singapore for talks on the summits logistics. The official added that communication between the United States and North Korea had broken down and that Pyongyang had broken promises by canceling meetings with South Korean diplomats and refusing to invite nuclear experts to witness the destruction of its nuclear weapons testing site.
2. Is it a bluff
It could be. Trump clearly wants a summit in order to burnish his foreign-policy credentials. He has referred to himself in recent weeks as a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. By cancelling, Trump might be hoping Kim will beg for a summit, making the terms more favourable for the United States.
Its a classic Trump move, says Mickey Bergman, the vice president of the Richardson Center for Global Engagement, who has participated in informal contacts between the two sides, known as Track II talks. He said that while the tactic may work in real estate, it hasnt been successful for Trump in diplomacy so far.
Speaking from the White House on Thursday, Trump raised the possibility that he may still meet with Kim. Its possible that the existing summit could take place or a summit at some later date, Trump said. Nobody should be anxious.
3. Was the decision coordinated with U.S. allies
South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has done more than any other leader to bring the United States and North Korea together, was in Washington this week. So was Japans Foreign Minister, Taro Kono. But Trump would not necessarily have consulted with the two countries before his announcement.
This president does not seem to be playing with others, Bergman says, noting that the announcement is particularly problematic for Moon, who has made reconciliation a cornerstone of his administrations policy.
The Japanese, on the other hand, may quietly welcome the decision. Japan had been wary of the outcome of any summit, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has declined to meet with Kim.
Shinzo Abe and (U.S. National Security Advisor) John Bolton are the two big winners today, says Sean King, who served as a senior Commerce Department official in the Bush administration and is now an executive at Park Strategies. Bolton unnerved Pyongyang late last month when he spoke of imposing elaborate, up-front restrictions on the North akin to the Libya model and is already being blasted as the saboteur of the summit.
4. What about sanctions
The United States already has formidable sanctions in place against North Korea. Advocates of isolating the regime argue that more U.S. pressure could be brought to bear by cracking down on Chinese banks facilitating North Korean sanctions evasion and by pressuring countries that play host to North Korean labourers to repatriate them ahead of the two-year timeline mandated by U.N. sanctions.
Right now, theres a lot more that the Trump administration could do, says Anthony Ruggiero, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a former Treasury Department sanctions official. You have to back it up with real consequences if persons continue to do business with North Korea.
Still, the success of any sanctions regime inevitably hinges on Chinas willingness to squeeze its neighbour. China appears to have stepped up its enforcement of sanctions against the North, but its extensive business ties and expansive border with the country means Beijing can easily and quickly relax restrictions on the North Korean economy.
5. Whats next
Trump could choose to send Secretary of State Mike Pompeo back to Pyongyang for more talks. Pompeo made to two trips to North Korea in the past two months and managed to negotiate the release of three American captives held there. But much depends on how Kim responds to Trumps announcement.
Robert Manning, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, says the effort at reconciliation had been undermined by sound bites and ultimatums.
This is sort of what happens when you do diplomacy backwards, upside down, by a megaphone, he says, mentioning Trumps constant tweets.
Bergman suggests that the summit might still go ahead but without a prior announcement  taking some of the scrutiny off the two leaders ahead of the meeting.
6. What about those coins
In what will certainly go down as an embarrassing example of the proverbial cart going before the horse, the White House minted dozens of commemorative coins ahead of the summit, embossed with the words peace talks and headshots of Trump and Kim. If the two leaders eventually meet, the coins will be handed out to members of the delegations and sold at the White House gift shop. If not, look for them on eBay.

Pakistan thrash England to win first Test
London, Sunday: Pakistan beat England by the commanding margin of nine wickets to win the first Test at Lords on Sunday.
Set just 64 for victory on the fourth morning, Pakistan finished on 66 for one before lunch to go 1-0 up in this two-match series.
Imam-ul-Haq was 18 not out and Haris Sohail, who hit the winning boundary off Dominic Bess, 39 not out.
England were undone by two top-order batting collapses, slumping to 184 all out after winning the toss in their first innings and declining to 160 for six in their second before fifties from Jos Buttler and Test debutant Dominic Bess prevented an innings defeat.
This was Englands seventh loss in 10 Tests as their first match under new national selector Ed Smith ended in a resounding defeat. The second Test at Headingley starts on Friday. AFP

Piramal Glass Turnover crosses Rs 6.8 bn
Piramal Glass Ceylon PLC (PGC) completed yet another challenging year with a turnover of Rs.6,816 million and PAT of Rs.344 million. Whilst the turnover increase was marginal when compared to the previous year, it was the highest ever turnover recorded by the company.
A total revenue achieved for the year was Rs.6,816 million as against Rs.6,783 millionn of the previous year. The domestic revenue saw a dip of 16% from Rs. 5,469 million in F17 to Rs. 4,595 million during the year under review.
Beverage and liquor segments were affected with the introduction of new taxes and levies while the Agro sale was affected due to the adverse weather conditions.
In the export segment, it was encouraging to note the Rs 2 billion mark being crossed with a growth of 77%. The export turnover was Rs. 2,136 million when compared to Rs.1,209 million during the year F17.
The exports increased mainly in the US & Canadian markets with the company gaining entrance to several new markets which include Malaysia, Africa, Vietnam and Myanmar. The export to US has grown by over 150%, Australia by 72% and a six fold increase in the Canadian markets.
The gross profit for the year improved from Rs. 1,371 million to Rs. 1,422 million depicting a marginal increase in GP margins from 20% to 21%. Also, the Operating Profits increased from 11% to 13% from Rs. 779 million to Rs. 869 million.
These results were achieved despite the high impact of depreciation on the investments made during the year. The depreciation increased by 31% from Rs. 553 million to Rs. 722 million. The profitability was further affected by an increase in Interest costs and high energy prices. The annualized impact of the interest on the long term loan of Rs. 3 billion taken for the relining & upgradation of the facility at Horana is reflected in the year under review. The interest cost was Rs. 328 Mn as against Rs.176 Mn of the previous year. The impact of high furnace oil prices and fluctuating LPG prices continued during the period under review.
The year closed for PGC with a PAT of Rs. 344 million as against Rs. 485 million of the previous year. However, following the consistent policy of a 50% payout ratio, the Board of Directors have proposed a dividend of 18%.

Rags to riches story of Meghan's beagle
The brown and white beagle, Guy, who had moved in to Kensington Palace with the Duchess of Sussex last year was always known to be a rescue dog. However, new information has emerged revealing that Guy was days away from being put down before being rescued by Meghan Markle.
A Dogs Dream Rescue, the dog shelter in Toronto that took Guy in, has described how he was placed in a kill shelter after being found wandering in the woods in Kentucky in 2015.
Volunteers from the charity organised for Guy to be driven across to Canada to an adoption event, where the Suits actress spotted him and took him home immediately.
Guy was living in a shelter after being found lost in a Kentucky forest, and now hes living in a palace, said Dolores Doherty, who runs A Dogs Dream Rescue and arranged to have Guy driven 500 miles to Canada by a relay of volunteer drivers. Its a fairytale, a real rags to riches story, she told AFP of the incredible story.
The beagle had only been in Canada for one day when Meghan, who was living in Toronto and filming her television series Suits, spotted him at an adoption event.
According to Dolores Meghan had been looking for a companion for her other dog Bogart, a German shepherd mix.
Hes so adorable with his long brown ears and big eyes and little round beagle body. Wed shown Meghan another dog that we thought might be a good match, but she saw Guy and immediately she wanted to take him home, she said.
In November the rescue organisation took to Facebook to celebrate Guys new life, upon reading that Meghan was engaged to Prince Harry.
Well its official! Spring of 2018 will mark the date that one of our rescued Beagles will become part of the royal family! they wrote.
Guy was rescued by A Dogs Dream, and then adopted by Meghan Markle in Toronto a few years ago - the same Meghan Markle that is now married to Prince Harry! How is that for a rags to riches story from a good ole Kentucky Beagle! Adopt, dont shop! they added.
Recently The Queen is believed to have ridden to Windsor alongside Meghans rescue dog.
A pooch bearing a striking resemblance to her beloved beagle, Guy, was spotted in the back of the monarchs car as she rode through Datchet, ahead of the royal wedding. It was spotted by Lainey Gossip in a video posted by MailOnline and shared widely on Twitter.
Bride took Guy with her when she relocated from Toronto to London last year to live with Harry at Kensington Palace. The Queen was said to be heartbroken last month after the death of her last corgi, Willow.
The beagle  once described by Meghan as her absolute world  was injured shortly after Clarence House announced the actresss engagement to Prince Harry, the Mail on recently revealed.
Guy was flown to London last year from Canada where he lived with Meghan while she worked on television series Suits.
While it is not clear how the injuries occurred, the dog was reportedly receiving treatment from television super vet, Professor Noel Fitzpatrick, who is renowned for his bionic surgery techniques.
Prince Harry is said to have joined his anguished fiancee on visits to see Guy. The dog is believed to be receiving treatment at a facility in Surrey.
Guy arrived to join his owner having gone through a lengthy checking process. To secure permission to live in the UK, foreign pets must be microchipped, be given a rabies vaccination, and then have a blood test 30 days later.
In an interview earlier this month, Meghan revealed, One [dog] is now staying with very close friends and my other, little Guy, hes in the UK, hes been here for a while.
Meghan has previously described her dogs as my boys, and gushed that they mean the absolute world to her.
During her time in Toronto, the animals repeatedly appeared on her Instagram page and were pictured snuggled up in bed with her.
Prince Harrys wife had to make the heartbreaking decision to leave behind her dog Bogart after moving to the UK to start her new life, as the pet is thought to be too old to fly overseas.

Rs. 300 million earned from recycled garbage
The government was able to earn Rs. 300 million from recycling garbage during the last six months, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He said that compost fertiliser had been produced out of the garbage in Colombo city which had been a menace to the city.
The Minister added that the compost and recycled garbage in the Colombo city would be used to fill the park area in Colombo Port City.
He made these observations at an environment promotion project in Katubedda, Moratuwa.
Minister Ranawaka said that in a project initiated by the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation Development Corporation (SLLRDC), the garbage transported to Kerawalapitiya is recycled in a yard.
The Minister said the compost produced there is sold as the Mihijaya Pohora as bulks for coconut cultivation and for other purposes as well.
He added the same was initiated in last November to find a solution to the garbage issues that was aggravated by the Meethotamulla garbage slide.
Minister Ranawaka said at Kerawalapitiya, plastic, polythene and glass, including bottles are separated and sold to the traders there.
He said these projects initiated by his Ministry would solve the garbage issue in Colombo and in the suburban cities for another eight decades.
He added that the first phase of the project would be completed at Aruwakkalu by November this year.
However, this issue does not come within the ambit of his ministry but the Colombo Municipal Council. But on the request of President Maithripala Sirisena, the matter is handled by our ministry, he said.
Minister Ranawaka further said that hence the garbage dump at Meethotamulla would be removed and the same place would be developed with Urban Development Authority funds.
He also said that following the removal of the garbage dump at Bloemendhal Road the same place would be used for a Sri Lanka Customs project.
This is sustainable development, Minister Ranawaka said.
This government would not acquire those lands forcefully in order to sell them to foreign investors and to entangle the county in a debt trap, Minister Ranawaka said.

## Title: Sir D.B.s last will

Sir D.B.s last will
On the corner of Bauddhaloka Mawatha (once known as Bullers Road) and Bullers Lane, lies Thurban House. For many years, it stood, unassuming, and for many people, almost lost in sight. This was until Sanath Weeratne, the Public Trustee, started refurbishing it. This year, they unveiled a statue in front of it. It was the statue of Sir D.B. Jayatilaka - this year was his 150th birth anniversary and tomorrow (29) will be his 74th death anniversary.
Thurban House, once owned by Sir D.B., was his prized possession, said Weeratne, and in his last will, he left the house and his close to 100-acre coconut estate in Dodangaslanda, called Pitakanda Estate, to the Public Trustee to manage. More importantly, he insisted that the Office of the Public Trustee as long as it functions in Sri Lanka, functions from his house. If not for Sir D.B., we would not be here today, literally, said Weeratne.
The life and, perhaps even more, the death of Sir D.B. Jayatilaka has been closely entwined with the Office of Public Trustee. In the 76 years he lived, Sir D.B., an educationalist, scholar and statesman, came to be a trailblazer for many who came after him. He was the first Sri Lankan Vice President of the Legislative Council of Ceylon; the Home Affairs Minister and Leader of the House of the State Council of Ceylon; and the first Representative of the Government of Ceylon in New Delhi. An ardent scholar of Buddhism, he founded the Young Mens Buddhist Association (YMBA) and helped uplift Dharmaraja College, Kandy and Ananda College, Colombo, during his time as their principals.
More importantly, according to Weeratne, he was a key personality in the establishing of the Office of the Public Trustee and was one of the first to donate his property to it.
The Public Trustee today manages 1,100 wills and over 54 estates and trusts, but it all started with the last will of Sir D.B.
The last will
Great insight into a mans life can be obtained through the reading of his last will. It embodies who he is and what he treasures most. And more importantly, what he would like his legacy to be.
I have seen thousands of wills in my time as an attorney and now as the Public Trustee, but Sir D.B.s last will is truly one of the most remarkable, said Weeratne.
Public Trustee Sanath Weeratne reads Sir D.Bs last will.
Sitting in his office at Thurban House, he explained how Sir D.B. had described what he wished done with his assets to the very last detail, including his clothes. I direct the Public Trustee to sell all my wearing apparel and to apply the proceedings for charitable purposes in his discretion, said Weeratne, reading from Sir D.B.s will.
This was a person who was tipped to be the first Prime Minister of the country, if not for his untimely demise. He bestowed the majority of his estate, or the most prized asset, in the trust of the Public Trustee. That shows the faith people like Sir D. B. had at that time in the system - in the administrative, legislative and political system of the country which was prevalent in our country.
The date of Sir D.B.s his last was January 4, 1933, three years after he was elected from the Colombo District to the Legislative Council of Ceylon and then appointed as its Vice President - the highest post a Ceylonese could hold in the Legislature at the time. It is unusual for a politician to leave his prized assets to the state as soon as he is elected to government, but this reflected a rare trait of committing oneself completely to the service of ones country.
Further, he nominated the Public Trustee as the sole executor of his will, disbarring all others to question the discretion and authority of the Public Trustee when executing it.
It is amazing to see how the Public Trustee has been such given a lot of authority, said Weeratne.
The will further states, All books, both printed and manuscript other than books of account in my library, I give and bequeath unto the Young Mens Buddhist Association (YMBA), a Corporation duly incorporated by the Ordinance 11 of 1927. To be preserved carefully as a separate collection and I declare it to be my ardent wish that no work of importance be removed from the reading room of the said association. I further declare that the receipt of the person who professes to be the secretary, for the time being, of the said association, shall be sufficiently discharged to the Public Trustee who shall not be concerned to see that my aforementioned wish is carried out.
So he donates his entire library to the YMBA and he says that as long as the person holding the position of secretary of the YMBA issues a receipt, that person has the obligation of Public Trustee. That shows the faith he had not only in one institution, but all other associations, said Weeratne.
When it comes to the personal effects, Sir D.B. states, I direct the Public Trustee to divide the said jewellery into as many shares and proportions as are nearly equal in value to the best judgement and in absolute and uncontrolled discretion of the Public Trustee.
His most prized asset, Thurban house which sits on 30.5 perches of prime land in Colombo 7, he wanted to be used as the Office of the Public Trustee in Sri Lanka.
He built this property on his own. His relatives say he built it between 1928 and 1930. Very soon this will be a heritage property when it reaches 100 years, said Weeratne.
The bricks for the house had come from his family kiln in Kelaniya and according to records at the Public Trustee, he had taken an annual insurance premium of Rs. 50,000 on the house from an insurance company in England.
He would apparently sit on the balcony at the front and watch the races at Race Course as a way to relax after a long day.
The story goes that Sir D.B. named his house Thurban House after a name he picked up during his time at Oxford University. Perhaps it was after Thomas W. Thurban, the first violinist in the orchestra of the Oxford Music Hall in the 1930s.
And given his love for the house, he states in his will, And without imposing any restrictions whatsoever upon the Public Trustee I declare it to be my earnest wish that as far as possible and practicable, my residual immovable properties, in particular the house and grounds called Thurban House on Bullers Road, Colombo and my Pitakanda estate situated at Maduragoda, in the Kurunegala District, shall not be sold.
Weeratne noted that it was a good thing that this was included. One fine day, you might have someone say, Why should the Public Trustees office be here, you could sell it and put up a hotel, apartment or shopping complex, because this is prime property So I think his foresight was such that he wanted his legacy to continue. The legacy of Thurban House, his prized asset, to continue. His legacy of his coconut estate to continue as a coconut estate. He obviously did not want any apartments or quarries to replace them.
Finally, in one of the last paragraphs of the last will, he states, Public Trustee to place those monies in fixed deposits in any bank or banks and to pay the income from such deposits to or for the benefit of any educational or charitable purpose or purposes or for social work in such manner as the Public Trustee (whose discretion as to whether any purpose or work is educational, social or charitable shall be final) may in his absolute and uncontrolled discretion see fit.
To Weeratne, this last will is a great example of a man using the letter of the law in the best possible manner. The way he uses his language is remarkable. He directs at times, he pleads at times (earnest request to not sell this), then gives absolute undisturbed discretion on what to do with the money.
Have we held up our end of the bargain
According to A.A. de Silvas book Lives that Inspire, Sir D.B., came to politics without some of the advantages most of his contemporaries had over him.
He did not come from the rich land-owning class, nor was he professionally qualified at the time of his entry into national politics. But long before he left active the active political scene in 1943, to be become Ceylons first representative in India, he had become the undisputed leader of Ceylon.
D.S. Senanayake who went on to become the first Prime Minister of independent Ceylon was Sir D.B.s deputy.
During the election of 1924 to the National Legislative Council, D.B. was so popular that no one was willing to contest him in his electorate. In fact, no one dared to do so since public opinion and public support would have at that time won him any position.
His biographer further states, His popularity was neither purchased nor earned overnight. This was the esteem of a people who held Jayatilaka high, for his services in many fields over the years.
However, during his life Jayatilaka proved to be too honest to be able to survive. After he successfully negotiated for food aid from India when the British governors could not, he was seen as too much of a risk by both the British as well as his deputy. Sinhalese novelist K. Jaytillake, in his works on political figures of the time, wrote that D.S. Senanayake had a strong pragmatic leadership, but at the same time D.S. had personal ambitions over national politics. D.Ss instincts told him that the British colonial rulers would be leaving soon and there would be strong competitors like Sir D.B. Jayathilaka. D.S. never trusted Sir D.B. Jayathilaka who was a popular national leader. Obviously, D.S. knew that Sir D.B. could be a potential threat to his future political ambitions. D.S. activated an internal conspiracy that enabled him to abridge Sir D.B. from the National politics. Sir D.B. was requested to go to India to serve as the Sri Lankan high commissioner. He agreed to go to India without realising the after effects of his decision. But in later years, Sir D.B. realised that he was misled by his colleagues. Sir D.B. Jayathilaka was utterly disappointed and died in India.
He took ill in 1944 and on May 29 of that year, as he was being flown back to Ceylon, he passed away with the last words, Are we in Ceylon His plane was still over Indian waters.
Famous businessmen and philanthropists from Sir D.B.s time, inspired by his actions, had followed suit and donated their own prized assets to the Public Trustee. Weeratne explained that figures like Gate Mudaliyar N.D.A. Silva Wijesinghe, T.S.W. Samarakoon, C.E. Wanigasooriya, J.E. Jayasuriya, M.J.C. Chandrasekara, U.B. de Silva, and Harry Hapugoda were all prominent figures who donated their assets to make the Public Trustees office what it is today. Sir D.B. set the momentum, he said.
Trust in the Public Trustee
The Office of the Public Trustee, similar to Sir D.B., had started off with all the right convictions, but in a corrupt system, over the years, it too had succumbed. The building, almost a reflection of the current political system, is worn down, with very little having been done to upkeep its stature as well as its structure.
Whoever who holds the post of Public Trustee has the obligation to maintain the property, because we get a rent of Rs. 895,000 per month from the Treasury for the building. In addition, we get an income from the coconut estate, said Weeratne.
When I came, the security post was just a cardboard held up with metal poles. It didnt seem right. We also laid bitumen in the car park area and refurbished the hall. We turned the garage into a visitors waiting room.
Fire extinguishers were installed for the first time, a must in a place which handles so much of paper and last wills. Weeratne also took on an insurance cover for the house once again. This is not done for show, but to preserve the building so the value of the building improves.
Whilst funding to improve the building further is limited, he believes that by phasing it out, it could be gradually refurbished in whole. This should not be tucked away like a haunted bungalow; it should be brought out to the public, like Independence Arcade. This is one of the properties gifted to us by the greatest sons of the country.
In February of this year, his relatives at their own cost, built a statue of Sir D.B. Jayatilaka in the front lawn of Thurban House in honour of him.
Faith in the system
The bigger task of instilling faith in the system, however, would be an uphill task. Last year, Weeratne found that the last wills of 254 people between 1931 and 1992 had not been opened. Unlike Sir D.B., their wishes had not been carried out.
Legal action was instituted to open these wills and Weeratne has the uphill task of resolving the legal quagmire to ensure that the objectives of the wills are met.
We manage it all with a full cadre of 87 officers. It is a very difficult task, but we are doing it because that is our mandate, he said.
He added that it was imperative that they fulfilled their mandate with the highest possible financial transparency. There have been some lapses in the past, but we are in the process of rectifying it.
Interestingly, some of these processes also include Sir D.Bs own will.
The Trustee will look into restarting annual donations he had asked to be given to certain institutions. For example, the annual prize of Rs. 20 to Vishaka College in the name of my late wife, annual prize of Rs. 20 each to Dharmaraja College, Ananda College and Wesley College, Colombo. Annual donation of Rs. 50 to Vidyalankara School in Peliyagoda, an annual donation of Rs. 30 to the Social Services League of Colombo in the name of my late wife. Annual donation of Rs. 12 to the Wellawatte Buddhist Girls Industrial School, Colombo, in the name of my wife (no longer exists).
To avoid repeating the mistakes in Sir D.B.s will, Weeratne said they were going to implement a system to check whether objectives in wills which need annual action are being carried out. This is fundamental and not only for D B Jayatilaka and his will and trust, but it has to be the case with all other wills and trusts.

SLFP against JVPs 20th Amendment
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party is against the 20th Amendment to the Constitution (20A) to abolish the Executive Presidency brought by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna as a private members bill, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said yesterday.
Devapriya told the Daily News that there is no need to abolish the executive presidency or prunuing down more executive powers. He said that it is his personal opinion just as much as it is of the SLFP.
Devapriya pointed out that President Maithripala Sirisena has removed the executive powers of the Presidency to its maximum limits. Devapriya also pointed out that the majority of the public also believes that the executive presidency should remain.
Devapriya said that they do not want a Parliament where the Prime Minister has supreme powers. In fact, it is the SLFP that should really request to abolish the Executive Presidency. We as a political party and late Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike as a politician had to face repercussions of the executive presidency. However, we all know that we could not have won the war without an executive presidency, Devapriya said.
On the same note, the Chief Minister also said that they are skeptical about the way certain groups in Northern areas and LTTE supportive diaspora operate.
He also said bringing in the 20th amendment to abolish the executive presidency could be an indirect support to a different political agenda. Most of the political parties were unable to produce a leader to hold presidency. But, we, as the SLFP have provided such leaders and we have such leaders with us.
Devapriya said that there has not yet being any party-level discussion with regards to the 20th amendment.
The 20th Amendment to the Constitution (20A) to abolish the Executive Presidency was presented by the JVP to the Attorney General (AG) and the Prime Minister (PM) last Thursday. Under the proposed 20th Amendment, the President will be appointed by Parliament, instead of a Presidential Election. The President will continue to be the Head of State and the Commander - in - Chief of the Armed Forces, but he will no longer be the Head of Government and the Head of the Cabinet of Ministers. The proposed 20th Amendment will be implemented only after the current term of office of President Maithripala Sirisena. As per the Draft Bill, the Head of Government and the Head of Cabinet of Ministers will be the Prime Minister.
The Presidents powers are distributed among the Cabinet, Prime Minister, Constitutional Council and independent commissions. However, the President will continue to have the powers of appointing the Governors of Provinces as same as the 13th Amendment.
The Presidents power to appoint Ambassadors and High Commissioners and grant pardon will be subject to Cabinet approval as per the proposed amendment.It will also remove the Presidents power to prorogue Parliament.

If they fail to submit audit reports
Sports bodies to face wrath of Sports Minister
A special media meeting was held on Saturday at the Duncan White Hall of the Sports Ministry by Sports Minister Faiszer Mustapha on amendments to the National Sports Act to rectify areas which are controversial. Officials representing 64 sports associations and a large gathering were present.
Addressing the gathering the Minister said:
We expect unity from sports. But when looking at the issues of sports associations unity is a problem. To my mind we hope to find unity, reconciliation and brotherhood through sports in any country. The rules and regulations of the Sports Act of 1973 confer great authority to the Minister of Sports. I have an issue with regard to this.
The Minister approves the sports teams. The selectors are appointed by the Minister, and also there is a fund which the Minister can distribute at his discretion. It is necessary to arrive at a broad consensus in using these funds after discussions with sports associations.
When I took over this Ministry I stated that I will appoint interim committees only if there are financial fraud. I have a problem why some associations have not submitted the financial statements as yet. Also reports too have not been submitted. The advice of the Auditor General has not been implemented in some cases. I have requested the Auditor General to be present today to give you all a clarification on audits.
Further various sports associations have presented several issues with regard to administration and constitutions. Please give us your ideas. I am committed to doing the best for sport. I am ready to sacrifice my prerogative if you feel that is in the best interest of sports. I hold the position that the Sports Ministers prerogative should be divested to a committee. I have observed that in some instances when appointing selectors some people come forward and say do not appoint such and such a person. The same is true when appointing teams. In some cases certain decisions have been taken. I have therefore appointed a legal committee.
Six lawyers have volunteered to assist me free of charge. I will be obtaining the views of the public subsequent to obtaining the views of sports associations. I will give 14 days for this. This is a journey we have to go together. I am not ready to be a partisan. The Minister is accused of being partisan when elections to sports associations are due. This finger pointing is because the Minister has powers when it comes to appeals with regard to actions. The final decision with regard to elections rests with the Minister. In other Ministries it is the Ministry Secretary who takes administrative decisions. The Minister is in charge of policy. There is a difference in the Sports Act and other Acts. The Chief Accounting Officer of other Ministries is the Secretary. According to the Sports Act the Minister can supersede the Secretary. We need to find a solution to this issue.
I am taking this opportunity to obtain your views. There are some sports associations that have never submitted audited reports. As Minister I will be taking stern action regarding this. It is necessary to have an audited report to check on financial irregularities. There can be big financial problems in associations that do not audit their accounts. I have to state that if anyone sits as a chairman or official of an association and have not submitted the audited reports of the previous year then you have a legal obligation regarding any frauds or irregularities that had taken place. Do not say that you did not hold office previously.
My view is that you are responsible for the Audited Reports of the previous year. Prior to taking up duties as chairman you should obtain the Audited Reports. Any Audit Report is linked to previous years. There cannot be a standalone audit report.

Q - What are the steps that should be taken to protect the infants and children during floods
A - Babies should be breastfed all the time without giving them other liquids in order to protect them from germs that lead to diseases. Pregnant mothers who's delivery date is close should be admitted to hospitals. Children who are in welfare camps should not be kept alone and always an adult should keep an eye on them in order to protect them from sexual abuse.
Q - What are the proper sanitation methods to be followed
A - Toilets should be used all the time to ensure proper sanitation while hands should be thoroughly washed after using the toilet every time. Women should use sanitary pads. Even children should be directed to use toilets whenever required. Infants' excreta should be disposed in toilets and not anywhere else. The Public health Inspector (PHI) of the relevant area should be contacted to obtain chlorine to clean wells that are used to obtain drinking water.
Q - How can we prevent accidents during floods
A - Walking and playing in flood water should be prevented. People should keep themselves away from broken live electricity wires. People should be in a protected and closed place during lightning.
They should not be in open places.
Q - How should sick and wounded be taken care of
A - If anyone have loose motion, fever, cough, rash, etc he/she should obtain medical treatment from the medical team of the welfare camp without delay. All wounds should be cleaned, dressed and kept dry without being allowed to contact with flood water.
Q - How can we prevent possible outbreaks of epidemics during floods 
A - All garbage should be disposed properly without allowing mosquitoes to breed.
Otherwise dengue mosquitoes can breed in water collected inside garbage.
****
The flood affected and contaminated wells can be re-used after cleaning. The wells can be cleaned by following the instructions issued by the Health Ministry.
* The Public health Officer (PHI) or MOH of the relevant area should be consulted before starting to clean the well. The well should be emptied using a motor or manual mechanism. Inside walls of the well should be thoroughly cleaned using a big brush. Then let the well fill with natural water.
* After filling the well, a fresh water bucket should be taken from the cleaned well. Then two table spoons of TCL powder obtained from the PHI or MOH of the relevant area should be thoroughly mixed in the water bucket taken from the well. The bucket with the mixture should put back into the well carefully using a clean tug.
* The bucket should be moved inside the well water up and down several times in order to mix the mixture with the well water properly.
* The well water can be used after 30 minutes of this process. Mixing TCL powder with well water (as described above) should be done three times a day. One tablet of chlorine should be used for five litres of tap water if people cannot assure the cleanliness of tap water they consume, the sources added.

Third Space Global awarded Great Place to Work 2018 status
Third Space Global, the British owned and BOI approved company based in Orion City was recognised as a Great Place to Work 2018 company.
The GPTW 2018 certificate was officially presented to Third Space Globals CEO, Roshan Nilaweera by GPTW Sri Lankas CEO, Kshanika Ratnayaka recently at the Third Space Global office.
Ratnayaka said that this is an exceptional achievement given the uniqueness of Third Space Global. Unlike many of Sri Lankas successful companies, TSG is relatively young, having only been set up in June 2015.
Since 2015, TSG has rapidly scaled from 25 to 250 staff whilst growing its business volume 17 fold. Despite its youth, TSG has remained focused on building a strong culture based on its core values of: Care, Commitment, Integrity, Innovation, and Excellence. This has allowed the team to rapidly adapt and grow as it scaled. It is not just the companys age, Third Space Globals workforce too is unusually young, with an average employee age of 23.3 years.
Third Space Global continues to break with tradition as female staff represent 62% of the workforce. This figure is nearly twice that of the disappointing 36% female representation in the national labour force  the successes and challenges of which were discussed by Countess Sophie during her recent visit to Sri Lanka. TRH Prince Edward and the Countess also visited Third Space Global during their February trip.
Ratnayaka also commented on how exciting it is for Sri Lanka to have Third Space Global provide education services to the UK in such an innovative method. Currently, Third Space Global is the only company in the world that delivers one-to-one Maths online teaching to a state school education sector. By working directly with the schools, TSG are able to work with at-risk children who need extra support, thus allowing TSG to pursue its social mission We seek social change by cultivating a global community of the most ambitious talent to make effective online teaching more accessible than ever before.
For Roshan Nilaweera, this award is deserving recognition of the staff and culture at TSG. Going forward, Third Space Global intends to build upon this success by expanding its CSR programmes in collaboration with Sri Lankas Department of Education as well as Commercial Bank whilst also looking at the development of a new technology platform to create jobs and opportunities across the whole of Sri Lanka.

Time to abandon grand ethical theories
Ethics today is in a curious state. There is no shortage of people telling us that Western civilization is facing a moral crisis, that the old foundation of Christianity has been removed but nothing has been put in its place. Christian writers such as Alister McGrath and Nick Spencer have warned that were running on the moral capital of a religion weve long abandoned. Its only a matter of time before, like Wile E. Coyote, we realize weve run off a moral cliff, impossibly suspended in mid-air only as long as we fail to realize theres nothing under our feet.
One supposed sign of this malaise is that scepticism about morality has never been higher. University philosophy lecturers consistently report that their new undergraduates tend to arrive assuming that all thinking people are moral relativists who believe that whats right for some is wrong for others and thats all there is to be said for it. Psychology has fuelled this scepticism, with researchers like Joshua Greene arguing that most moral judgements come straight from the hot amygdala, not the cool prefrontal cortex. On this account, moral principles are post-facto rationalizations of emotional reactions.
Corporate responsibility
Yet for such a sickly beast, ethics is energetically at work everywhere. You may doubt the sincerity of corporate social responsibility but the very fact that every reasonably sized company feels the need to demonstrate it says something about public expectations. Ethical consumers used to be a small band of idealistic hippies but now mainstream supermarkets boast of their fairly traded coffee and chocolate.
You cant actually buy a banana at Sainsburys that doesnt carry the Fairtrade label. In 1997 Robin Cook was laughed at for making the modest suggestion that our foreign policy must have an ethical dimension.
Now governments are routinely lambasted when they are seen not to have one. Sexual harassment has gone from being just one of those things to a moral failing for which you can lose your job and your reputation. For a nation that has lost its moral compass, we seem remarkably keen to march to an ethical beat.
Social psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists would not be baffled by this apparent contradiction. Many have long believed that morality is essentially a system of social regulation.
As such it is in no more need of a divine foundation or a philosophical justification than folk dancing or tribal loyalty. Indeed, if ethics is just the management of the social sphere, it should not be surprising that as we live in a more globalized world, ethics becomes enlarged to encompass not only how we treat kith and kin but our distant neighbours too.
Theoretical framework
Philosophers have more to worry about. They are not generally satisfied to see morality as a purely pragmatic means of keeping the peace. To see the world muddling through morality is deeply troubling. Wheres the consistency Wheres the theoretical framework Wheres the argument
Sometimes, they have a point. Take ethical consumerism. Desirable though it is that more people are thinking about the moral consequences of their purchasing and investment decisions, too many of these rest upon unexamined assumptions about what really is ethical and what isnt. Ethical Consumer magazine, for example, scores down companies that invest in GMOs or the arms trade and gives points to those who use vegan or organic ingredients. But many believe GMOs can be positively beneficial to society, organic products arent always the most ethical and eschewing animal products doesnt make a company good. Nor can anyone who is not a pacifist object to selling arms per se.
Although popular ethics is often somewhat loose, it can also be inappropriately precise. Ethical Consumers score table for tablet computers, for example, gives the Sony Xperia Z tablet a 2.5 per cent higher ethical ranking than the Google Nexus 7 tablet. In moral philosophy, Jeremy Benthams hedonic calculus stands alone and ridiculed for its attempt to measure and quantify goodness. In corporate and consumer ethics, metrics are mainstream tools.
For instance, many organizations spend a lot of money on consultants who offer ethical audits. In principle, this is a very good thing, since you wouldnt want to take a large multinational or a government agencys word for its virtue. In practice, however, such audits easily turn into box-ticking exercises. Rather than measuring how good the organization is, they merely measure its ability to satisfy whatever criteria are set down. This introduces an unhelpful legalism into the process: just as many organizations feel justified doing anything as long as they avoid breaking the law, so they can end up believing they are good just because they havent breached their own or their sectors codes of ethical conduct.
Philosophical ethics
There is then a curious combination of incoherence and vagueness about just what it is to be ethical, and a bogus precision in the ways in which organizations prove themselves to be good. All this confusion helps fuel philosophical ethics, which has become a vibrant, thriving discipline, providing academic presses with a steady stream of books. Looking over a sample of their recent output, it is evident that moral philosophers are keen to show that they are not just playing intellectual games and that they have something to offer the world.
Malcolm Murrays Morals and Consent, for example, directly addresses the supposed crisis about moralitys foundations in a post-religious world. His opening sentence, A morality rooted in the indefensible is worse than one rooted in the defensible, is as clear and succinct a justification for his attempt to put ethics on a sound footing as you could demand. Like most moral philosophers working today, Murray offers a purely naturalistic account of morality, offering a version of contractarianism  the theory that morality is an implicit acceptance of mutual obligations and prohibitions  that emerged for evolutionary reasons. - Times Literary Supplement

Triposha turns to rusk with Japanese connection
Today most of the state-owned enterprises (SOE) are depended on government handouts for their survival and most of them also are huge white elephants. However Sri Lanka Thriposha is slowly and surely breaking off from this notorious tradition and is reversing it.
The institution produces the nutritional meal for kids known for several decades as Thiposha which is distributed free of charge through the Medical Officers of Health from their factory in Ja Ela. Due to its large production Thirosha is also distributed in a special goods train.
History...
The Thriposha programme was initiated in Sri Lanka in 1973 with the assistance of CARE institution in Canada and with the assistance of USA.
Production of Thriposha was initiated with the objective of providing a nutritious additional food to people in Sri Lanka with nutritious requirements. This additional food, which in the beginning, was imported from the U.S.A. was packed in Sri Lanka.
Ministry of Health gave its contribution to this project from 1976. The Management of Thriposha Project was transferred to the Ministry of Health by CARE institution in 1976. Consequently, on the tenders called for selection of a Company suitable for its management, the Ceylon Tobacco Company was selected for the purpose. Subsequently, a tri-partite agreement was signed among that Company, the Ministry of Health and CARE institution. From then on, the Ceylon Tobacco Company was responsible for its management up to 2010.
This entity was registered as a fully government owned Company belonging to the Ministry of Health by the name of Sri Lanka Thriposha Ltd., on 07.09.2010 under registration no. P.B.3873 under the Companies Act no. 07 of 2007.
After taken over by the government under the ambit of the Ministry of Health, the entity was subjected to many positive changes and various actions were taken to increase production by encouraging the staff. The entity claimed a progress as a result of action taken such as installation of new machinery and worker welfare activities.
The additional food of Thriposha claims a prominent place as a nutritional food very close to the hearts of Sri Lankans. They have identified its flavor and nutritional value for 40 years.
Thriposha is highly helpful to cater to the nutritional deficiencies that cannot be fulfilled by the main diet. A pregnant mother, or a breast feeding mother or an infant with nutritional deficiencies will receive two 750g packets of Thriposha each per month free of charge. It is proper to provide only the child suffering from nutrition deficiencies with an amount of 50g of Thriposha per a day.
For the first time the companys history it has provided over Rs. 1.75 million back to the State coffers from its profits. Since being a welfare nutritional meal making company, Thiposha is not authorized to sell their products.
Each year the government provides us a financial injection to make Thiposha and I saw that this has to be reversed, said Thriposha Chairman, M. D. Bandusena speaking to Daily News Business new feature MEET THE CHAIRMAN.
Then together with our Research and Development team we decided to look at manufacturing another product which we can sell to the masses and this is how Saposha was born.
He said that Saposha which was introduced to the market last year is sweeter and has a different formula.
Suposha product launch ceremony was held at Waters Edge Reception Hall Battaramulla. The new product is fast catching the market and its this profit that we gave back to the government.
He said that the success of this product must also be attributed to the new machinery that was installed few years ago. Thiposha was running with ageing machinery and there were regular machines breakdowns which slowed our production process. Sometimes machines have to be shut down for several weeks till the spare parts arrived from USA.
Many times we failed to meet our production targets due to this.
He recalled that when this issue was brought to the notice of the then Minister of Health and now President Maithripala Sirisena in 2014 he immediately intervened and allocated finances to buy new machines which resulted in the increase of productivity and reducing production cost.
The former Health Minister, allocated Rs. 500 million from Budget 2016 to purchase and install new machine. In Budget 2015, the annual allocation for Thriposha was Rs 2.5 billion.
These machines were then imported from USA and after their installation we were able to not only meet the demand but there was also a surplus.
Then we decided to look for a byproduct and this is how Suposha was born and this is turning out to be a very profitable venue.
Suposha supplement provides energy, protein and vitamins and minerals. It consists of locally grown maize, corn, soya, non-fat dried milk, minerals and vitamins.
The intention of the introduction of this product is to provide the cereal to everyone which was limited only to expectant mothers as well as infants under the freely distributed Thriposha programme.
This along with several other prudent masseurs helped the company to also pose a net profit of Rs. 103 million last year.
Enter the rusk industry
The Chairman said that they also made advances towards one of the leading Japanese rusk manufactures to tie up with Sri Lanka Thriposha and make rusks in Sri Lanka.
We had several rounds of discussion and will install one more machine and the rusk which is yet to be branded would be available end of the year.
Sri Lanka Thriposha is also looking at the possibility of providing the raw material to produce Thriposha to the Japanese company and for the first time in the history earn foreign exchange.
We also hope to manufacture part of their Rusks in Sri Lanka and re-export since its more economical for them to import it.
Bandusena said that they have also briefed Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne under whose purview Thriposha Company is and he too has endorsed this.
Current production of the Sri Lanka Thriposha Ltd. monthly has hit 2,700 metric tonnes. 1,800 metric tonnes is being distributed over 1.2 million beneficiaries islandwide under the Thriposha programme implemented with the support of the funds from the Department of Treasuries of the Government.
The excess 900 metric tonnes is now being sold as Suposha and this excess would also used to make rusk.
A bonus for employees
For the first time in the history of the company a a 10% bonus to all employees were paid.
The Chairman said that the company also opened a new sales outlet at Ja Ela to make their products available to the public. In addition we also have 40 sales agents island-wide who sell the additional production of Thriposha.
Before paying bonuses to the employees, Minister Senaratne who was the Chief Guest for this ceremony also opened the new machine worth Rs. 100 million installed with the aim of automating the entire production process.
Earlier, 75% of the Thriposha production was handled with machines while the rest of the 25% was handled with human labour. This will further reduce our costs and increase production.
Every year Thriposha programme distributes two packets per each recipient which adds up to over 2.4 million packets of Thriposha. Every recipient is being supported with 1.5 Kg of Thriposha monthly since the daily requirement is approximately 50 gram per person that totals to 1,800 metric tonnes.
He said that they will also pay more for local farmer products opening up a new avenue of opportunities in the agricultural sector and helping the rural economy. It would also create an additional SME industry.
We are also looking at regional exporters and launched our website to have better interaction with our local and would be foreign buyers.
Thriposha also built a special raw material storage facility recently and are hoping to further invest Rs. 250 million for an additional one.
This will help us to further reduce costs of production. Bandusena said he is turning around Thriposha from a 100% government dependent SOE to a profit making entirety and I am sure we will be able to be a financially self-sufficient institution before 2020.

He said the deceased were a six-month-old baby and a one-and-a-half-year-old toddler from the Wiyatinna and Matara areas.
The Director said altogether 10 children had died so far of viral fever. Nine of them were affected with influenza and complications caused by another virus.
He said steps would be taken to administer the influenza vaccine to patients after a health sector discussion today, said provincial Health Services Director Dr. G. Wijesuriya. He said parents need not entertain any excessive fears about children suffering from the disease.
The vital factor was hospitalisation as soon as a child contracted the disease.

Plight of influenza patients in the South
Vigour wanes amidst a brewing bane
Figures obtained from hospital sources showed that the number of patients admitted to the Matara General Hospital with symptoms of Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI), had almost doubled during the past week with relation to the week before. A total of 313 patients (145 children and 168 adults) diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection were admitted to the Matara General Hospital between May 14 and 21, while only 164 patients (89 children and 75 adults) were admitted between the May 7 and 13.
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), seasonal influenza viruses circulate and cause disease in humans every year. In Sri Lanka, for the last few years, it has been generally observed during April to June and again in November to January. It spreads from person-to-person through sneezing, coughing, or the touching of contaminated surfaces. Seasonal influenza viruses can cause mild to severe illness and even death, particularly in certain high-risk individuals.
Persons at increased risk for severe disease include pregnant women, children, the elderly, people whose immune systems are compromised and those with chronic underlying medical conditions such as cancer, diabetes mellitus and heart diseases. Seasonal influenza viruses evolve continuously, which means that people can become infected multiple times throughout their lives.
Sources at the the Matara General Hospital had confirmed this an said that patients diagnosed with URTIs are admitted to the hospital throughout the year, while there are sharp increases at this time of year as climatic conditions become ideal for the virus to spread.
It was stated that the unusually sharp increase within the past week was a matter of concern. A World Health Organisation (WHO) report stated that Influenza A(H1N1) is the commonly-circulating seasonal influenza A virus sub-type in Sri Lanka. During the current season, it had been observed to generally cause severe disease. This seasonal A(H1N1) virus is the same virus that caused the influenza pandemic and it first appeared in Sri Lanka in two waves during the 2009/10 period.
Ten to 15 samples of nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained from patients diagnosed with URTIs warded at the Matara General Hospital, are sent to the Medical Research Institute (MRI) for testing, each month. Of the 15 samples submitted in April, only one patient tested positive for Influenza type A virus, while in the month of May, five of the 39 samples submitted had tested positive.
Two deaths of persons suffering from respiratory tract infections had been recorded at the Matara General Hospital during the months of April and May. One was a 26-year-old female who was pregnant, while the other was a 59-year-old male.
Although samples obtained from the deceased had been submitted to the MRI, authorities had not received results as of yet. Hospital authorities in Matara had taken measures to stop the disease from spreading and may had restricted the number of visitors to two per patient, as a precaution.

Where beauty resides
I was a little agitated by the $10 entry fee for the Peradeniya Botanic Gardens, but it didnt take me long after entering to realize that it was money well-spent. Peradeniyas are the most fantastic botanic gardens Ive ever seen. Trees the size of sky-scrapers, flower bushes exploding in incredible color, giant palm trees that bloom just once in 45 years, and cannon ball trees with heavy round fruits were just some of the highlights. Ive never been so bowled over by botany.
The origins of this 150-acre park stretch back to 1371 when King Wickramabahu III established a residence here, and remained part of the royal grounds until the end of Kandyan independence. But although the British destroyed the palace, they also protected the area by designating it an official botanic garden.
We spent a happy couple hours exploring the park. Alone, the famous orchid house was worth a half-hour. Over 500 varieties of the fragile flower are nurtured here. Outside, we passed under trees with bending branches supporting fruit bats the size of Smart Cars. After venturing onto a wobbly suspension bridge extending over the river which borders the garden, a long avenue lined with royal palms led us to The Great Lawn, whose lone, lonely resident is a beautiful Java Fig Tree.
Ill stop prattling on in the hopeless attempt to describe the gardens beauty with words, and let our pictures do the talking. Suffice to say, if youre anywhere near Kandy during your trip to Sri Lanka, plan in a stop at the Peradeniya Royal Botanic Garden.

Working out as a teenager may keep women from shrinking later in life
Working out as a teenager may help women avoid shrinking in older age, a new study suggest.
Some shrinking is a normal part of aging, but women can lose up to two inches of height between the ages of 30 and 70.
More importantly, the more someone shrinks, the higher their risks of breaking bones are and that, in turn, is linked to an earlier death.
This is particularly worrisome for women, who are more prone than their male counterparts to osteoporosis, or weak bones.
Women who worked out strenuously as teenagers are less likely to shrink when they get older, a new University of Buffalo study reveals
Women who worked out hard in their younger years, however, were less likely to shrink or to shrink as much after menopause, a new University of Buffalo study found.
No matter how tall we stand, we will all eventually shrink at least a little bit.
Over the courses of their lives, men shrink an average of 1.3 inches, and women lose about an inch-and-a-half.
Shrinking happens as the vertebrae of the spine get dehydrated and the cartilage between them wears down.
More than half of Americans over 50 develop osteoporosis, a degenerative disease that weakens bones over time. This condition coupled with the inevitable effects of gravity and aging push us downward.
Women - who have smaller, more delicate bones than men to begin with - are disproportionately affected by both osteoporosis and shrinkage.
This vulnerability is due in part to a stage of life that only women pass through: menopause.
During menopause, a woman's period stop and she exits her reproductive years.
Women's estrogen levels decline precipitously during this stage, typically beginning around age 50.
Estrogen plays an important role in blocking a process known as bone resorption by which bone cells break down into their composite parts, and the remaining minerals get absorbed by the blood.
So once there is less estrogen to defend the bones, their break down speeds up, leading to shrinking and, for some, osteoporosis that greatly raises the risks of bone breaks, falls and even early death.
But of course, not everyone shrinks at the same rate, so the University of Buffalo researchers set out to determine what factors might speed up - or slow down - the process.
They found that 70 out of the 1,000 senior women involved in their study lost more than an inch of height over a five-year period. -Daily Mail

WP Governor calls for each citizen to donate Rs. 10 for flood-affected
If each voter of the Western Province contributed Rs. 10, we could raise Rs. 21.5 million and develop the lives of the citizens affected by floods. Although many came forward and provided aid, no one would volunteer to uplift the lives of the affected people and mitigate the risks of flood in the future, stated Western Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara on Friday.
We will create a system to collect the funds in the near future so that we all can be a part of the development process. I personally have taken a decision to provide a weeks salary to the victims affected by floods, stated the Governor.
There are three particular scientific factors which we must avoid to minimise the damage caused by floods. The kadolana fields, paddy fields and the fields of low-level crops which act as a sponge and absorb the water are being destroyed. These lands also strengthen the soil and should not be tampered with. Similarly, we should not cut down trees on the mountain tops which would cause soil erosion. Permitting construction in areas prone to flooding is another concern. Such buildings should have concrete pillars and should be built over the maximum level of flooding, explained the Governor.
The Western Provincial Council works hard with the government for the affected people during the floods. However, more help will be needed from every willing person to uplift the lives of the people affected in floods, the Governor stated.

This Years Man Booker International Winner has a favorite for next year
Olga Tokarczuk and I just won the 2018 Man Booker International, which is this years largest and most important prize for world literature since the 2018 Nobel Prize was called off due to a scandal. Needless to say, were thrilled. But one of the best things about the whole Man Booker adventure has been getting to know the other translators and writers. And I know exactly who is going to win next year.
On my way to London, I devoured Frank Wynnes witty, moving, pitch-perfect translation of Virginie Despentess incredible Vernon Subutex 1, from MacLehose Press (coming out in the US from FSG next fall). Despentes is a filmmaker and noted feminist critic with numerous other novels under her belt, including Apocalypse Baby, Bye Bye Blondie, King Kong Theory and Pretty Things (coming soon), all published by the Feminist Press and translated by Sin Reynolds, Stphanie Benson and Emma Ramadan, respectively.
Ive been getting a lot of good news lately. Among the best of it is the fact that Frank Wynnes translation of the next volume of Virginie Despentess Vernon Subutex trilogy is done and will be out in July. I cant believe I get to read another one! Let alone two more. Emma Ramadans translation of Pretty Things is coming out in August, too.
Its going to be a great summer. Gearing up to that, Ive briefly interviewed all four of Despentess English translators. Although I posed the same questions to all of them, their responses could not have been more different. The one thing they all shared was an abiding love of Despentess glorious prose and unassailable courage.

Jennifer Croft: Why did you translate Virginie Despentes
Frank Wynne: I would probably have gnawed off my right arm for the opportunity (I can type with my left!), but I didnt have to. The moment I was offered the trilogy, I dropped everything else I was doing. Despentes is one of the most fascinating, brilliant andto use that wonderful American wordornery writers to emerge in France in the last 20 years. I found her essays in King Kong Theory angry and dazzling, moving and inspiring, and in a world that has become mealy-mouthed and euphemistic, it was refreshing to come upon a voice that makes no attempt to sugarcoat the ugly, painful chaos that is living. The novel Baise-moi (and Despentess subsequent film) was like a slap in the face, brutal and visceral, yet profoundly humanas though Kathy Acker had rewritten Thelma and Louise. This was no meek fantasy of empowerment. It was hardly surprising when I read Vernon Subutex to find those same qualities in this baggy picaresque novel that seems like the bastard lovechild of Zola, Lisa Alther and the young Martin Amis.
Moreover, I recognized the characters in the novel, I grew up with the same music, the same cultural references, have watched friends and acquaintances drift as Vernons friends do, into bitterness, disappointment, xenophobia and misanthropy. I was in awe of Despentess ability to make even the least attractive characters utterly human, where, say, Jonathan Franzen, would probably have depicted them with barely disguised contempt. This was a sprawling fiction that somehow encapsulated the maxim of the (Black) Roman playwright Terence: Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto, I am human, nothing human is alien to me.
JC: If you had to choose one essential quality you were determined to preserve and transmit in your translation, what would it be
FW: The voices. Virginies characters leap off the page. The dialogueand the narrative voice that follows the characters like a steadicam in a moviecrackles and flares in bursts of anger, wit, melancholy, bitterness. It was like trying to catch lightning in a jam jar. Preserving the narrative shifts between the grave, compassionate voice of Xaviers mother, the bigoted splutterings of Loc, the machinegun hipster slang of Kikothis above all was what I was determined to preserve.
JC: What did you change
FW: Inevitably, the slang. While French and English have rich veins of slang, they are very different in their construction and their connotations. English has no equivalent of verlan, the syllable transposing slang of the banlieue (well, English has pig-Latin, but no one older than 11 would use it), which is richly inventive, and can fold in on itself endlessly (so Arabe becomes beur, becomes rebu and Tes viestso = tes soviet = tes russe = tes sr). As a result, I had to be as imaginative and as creative as possible in reworking the slang. I am grateful to Anne Tyler, from whose novel A Spool of Blue Thread I stole the epithet shitwank.
JC: What was the hardest part about the editing process for this book
FW: Every publisher has a house style, a system of rules that copy-editors and proofreaders are supposed to adhere to when preparing a manuscript for publication. No contractions or slang terms outside dialogue (cant, shouldnt, cop, arsehole). And all expect consistent punctuation. Virginies writing obeys none of these rulesnor is there any reason why it should. When I submitted the translation, I included a covering note explaining that while individual chapters are written in the third person, they echo the thoughts and language this means that the narrativethough third personis loose, vernacular and very, very slangy. It cannot and should not be adapted to house styleit is not omniscient narration. Despentess punctuation is eccentric but clearly considered and deliberatelists, including those of subordinate clausesoften appear with no commas. These should not be reinsertedany confusion that exists in English is duplicating the same in French. Virginie also uses embedded dialogueusually passing from reported to direct speech without a sentence break or inverted commas. Again, this is intentional. -Literary Hub
