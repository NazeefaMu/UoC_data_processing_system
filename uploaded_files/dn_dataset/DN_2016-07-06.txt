Dias shaping the future of under 19 cricketers
Guiding the destiny of our under 19 cricketers and preparing them for the next under 19 cricket World Cup is former Sri Lanka batting great and vice-captain Roy Dias.
Dias has been handed the task of preparing a team of players good enough to make an impact in the under 19 World Cup if not win it.
His first task since been appointed to the post is the ongoing under 19 series against South Africa where Sri Lanka are playing a series of three youth tests and three youth one-day internationals.
Sri Lanka has held its own against a strong South African unit and held them to a nil-all draw in the three youth tests played at the P Sara Oval, Welegedara Stadium Kurunegala and at Pallekele.
There are about four experienced guys other than that the rest are all playing for the first time at under 19 international level, said Dias.
They are quite good you have to expose them and give them more matches and see how they perform. My idea is to prepare them for the 2018 U19 World Cup which is in New Zealand. Right now we are playing the u19 boys but most of them are 17 plus and we need to give them the experience which is going to be important. I really involved in the last minute after the provincial under 19 tournament.
According to Dias from the present squad includes four players who played in the last under 19 World Cup who wont be eligible to play in the 2018 tournament. We are playing the experienced guys so that the juniors can learn from them as well.
Dias said that this was the first time he was handling an under 19 Sri Lanka squad. He had previously been head coach of the national senior team from 1998-1999 where they had mixed fortunes.
Sri Lanka had a successful tour of England in 1998 when they won the one-off Test at the Oval where Muthiah Muralitharan took 16 wickets and also the one-day tri-series that involved England and South Africa. Then on the tour to Australia in 1999 Muralitharan was called again in that infamous incident at Adelaide involving captain Arjuna Ranatunga and Australian umpire Ross Emerson. This was followed by a poor World Cup in 1999 where Sri Lanka failed to defend their crown which led to Dias getting the sack.
I thought coaching the under 19 boys was a good opportunity for me because I feel you have to start at the grassroot level. I have been doing that in other countries and when I showed interest Sri Lanka Cricket gave me the job, its a one year contract which is renewable, said Dias.
After his playing career was over Dias kept his links with cricket alive by setting up an academy for talented players in Colombo. He made a name for himself in the field of coaching when he was signed up by the Nepal Cricket Board as coach of both the senior and the junior sides in 2001. For the next eight years or so he was Nepals guiding light helping them to produce remarkable results.
They were Plate runners-up at the U-19 World Cup in 2002, beating Pakistan and Bangladesh before losing in the final to Zimbabwe.
They won the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) Youth Asia Cup in Karachi and qualified for the U-19 World Cup in 2004, and memorably beat South Africa and New Zealand to lift the Plate Championship in Sri Lanka in 2006. Dias efforts were recognised by the King of Nepal Gyanendra, who awarded him the Prabal Gorkha Dakshin Bahu (IV Class), an honour which is equivalent to a knighthood or OBE. After his stint with Nepal, Dias subsequently coached the Oman and Malaysian teams. Dias was unquestionably one of Sri Lankas first great batsmen whose career unfortunately divided between the pre-Test and post-Test era so that the international arena never had the opportunity of witnessing his fine technique and classic strokeplay especially his cover driving. By the time Sri Lanka became a fully-fledged Test nation and played their inaugural Test against England at the P Sara Oval in 1982 Dias was nearly 30. However for the next five years before his early enforced retirement his experience and skills were to prove of inestimable value to his country. He was a classically correct strokemaker, capable of both attack and defence, depending upon the circumstances and unlike many of his compatriots, equally comfortable against both pace and spin.
Two of his finest innings came in 1982 scoring a classic 109 on a fast Lahore pitch with Imran Khan at his best and the knock of 97 on a wearing Chennai (Madras then) pitch against Indias spinners.
Following Sri Lankas disappointing 1987 World Cup campaign Dias was one of a number of players who was discarded for both Test and one-day matches by the selectors. His final innings for his country was 80 against England in the 1987 World Cup. It was a sad end for a man who had done so much to make his nation competitive over the years since their admittance into international competition.
Dias was over 35 by this time, but he still appeared to have much to offer in the five-day game, and it seems unfortunate that his Test-match place was lost largely on the back of poor limited-overs results.
Dias final Test batting average of 36.71 is perhaps not overly impressive when viewed in isolation, but it fails to capture his immense contribution to a young and inexperienced team. He is still the fastest Sri Lankan to 1000 Test runs, getting there in just 23 innings, which ranks in front of legendary players such as Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara.
Dias next task with the Sri Lanka under 19 cricketers is a tour of England from July 17 where they are scheduled to play two under 19 youth tests and three under 19 youth ODIs.
Although it is an under 19 series the cut-off date for players is March 31, 1996 so it is more or less an under 20 side that England will be fielding, said Dias.
Sri Lanka Cricket has given permission to play boys who will be 19 plus because we have to play good cricket. We cant take a junior side and play an England team which is under 20, he said.
Its a good thing because some of the under 19 boys who have finished with the under 19 World Cup gets another chance to play good cricket.
Dias, a product of St Peters College said that it was difficult to compare the school cricket standards then and now.
These guys are playing quite a lot of cricket than we did. We hardly played any cricket at all we had about eight school matches for the season. These boys are getting more cricket and more exposure. I dont think the standards have fallen, said Dias. The side given to me is quite a good one and my job is to get them to the next level.

A gentleman sportsman as head of CB
So after much deliberation we finally have a Governor appointed for the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy, a Sri Lankan economist who is also a gentleman sportsman to the very letter.
Dr Coomaraswamy is not new to the Central Bank because he had served there in the Economic Research, Statistics and Bank Supervision divisions since 1973 and as a staff officer till 1989. From 1981 to 1989 he was seconded to the Ministry of Finance and Planning before moving onto work in the Commonwealth Secretariat from 1990-2008 holding the posts of Director, Economic Affairs Division and Deputy-Director, Secretary-Generals Office and later to head the Social Transformation Programme Division as interim director.
While Dr Coomaraswamys career as an economist has been penned in the news pages following his appointment as the new Governor of Central Bank we like to take stroll along memory lane and pen a few words about his career as a sportsman where he represented Royal College, Colombo, Harrow School in England, Cambridge University and University of Sussex.
Although Dr Coomaraswamy had his formal education at Royal College he was admitted by his father Rajendra Raju Coomaraswamy (an iconic diplomat affectionately nick-named Roving Raju) to Harrow for higher studies. By the age of 14 he played in the Harrow first eleven cricket team at the Mecca of cricket  Lords against traditional rivals Eton. He captained Harrow in 1967 and the following year he led them to beat Eton by seven wickets with a match bag of 12 wickets for 92 runs. Coomaraswamy took 7 for 42 off 21.4 overs to dismiss Eton for 210 in the first innings and 5 for 50 off 24 overs in the second innings when they were shot out for 141. Coomaraswamys contribution with the bat was 34 and 8.
Wisden Cricketers Almanac referred to as the Bible of cricket said,  some commendably accurate and well flighted left-arm slow bowling by Coomaraswamy, made this a notable match.
In 1971 and 1972 he played first-class cricket and rugby for Cambridge University. Returning to Sri Lanka Dr Coomaraswamy was a part of the Tamil Union cricket team that played in the division I inter-club tournament. He was vice-captain to S Skandakumar in the year Tamil Union won and lost the Lakspray trophy on a technical point to Bloomfield in 1983.
Going down memory lane Skandakumar reflected, Against CCC in a tough P. Sara game on their grounds prior to that season he (Dr Coomaraswamy) and I shared a 154-run partnership to get us out of a hole and clinch that match.
Describing the appointment of Dr Coomaraswamy as Central Bank Governor as an excellent choice Skandakumar who is presently the Sri Lanka High Commissioner in Australia illustrated him thus Gentlemen do not come any better than him ......anywhere in the world!
Although he performed well at cricket and rugby Dr Coomaraswamy once confessed that his first love was rugby. He captained Harrow for three years and also CR&FC and later led Sri Lanka in the 1974 Rugby Asiad in Japan to become runner-up which he treasures as one of the unforgettable moments of his sporting career.
His late uncle Sathi Coomaraswamy, an opening bowler was captain of the All-Ceylon cricket team of the fifties and was long active in Sri Lanka cricket administration that included being chairman of selectors.
In an interview when asked to pick his cricketing and rugby idols Dr Coomaraswamy chose Michael Tissera (the former Sri Lanka captain) and Sir Garfield Sobers (former West Indies captain) at cricket and said his rugby idol was Sari de Sylva one of the best the country has produced.
A MUCH NEEDED CHANGE
The ICC has finally decided to cut down on the massive advantage given to umpires on the lbw referrals which at times on television replays looked simply ridiculous when the ball tracker showed the ball to be hitting middle stump and because it was an umpires call the decision being ruled not out.
Now from October 1 the ICC has decided to modify the umpire's call aspect of lbw referrals. For on-field lbw decisions to be overturned, half of the ball would now need to hit any part of the stumps. Earlier, half of the ball needed to hit a zone between the middle of off stump and the middle of leg stump.
The ICCs chief executive Dave Richardson has said this has been made possible because of the MIT testing had proved ball tracking was good enough. "And for that reason we are able to safely reduce the margin of uncertainty or the umpire's call as we refer to. Because the middle of the ball was just marginally, one millimetre, to the right of centre of the stump, then the umpire's decision wasn't reversed. So what we have done really is just made that margin of uncertainty slightly bigger. Now the middle of the ball must be in line with the stump, which means half of the ball hitting the stump is going to be given out in the future.
All bowlers will welcome the change and batsmen must be wary not to use their pads too much when defending.

London Marathon medalist conducts program on running
Colombo City Running (CCR), a community-based recreational running group which aims to promote and improve running in Colombo, conducted a program for its members with none other than London Marathon Medalist and professional runner Lewis Chalk at the CR & FC grounds recently.
Stafford Garments, one of Sri Lankas leading apparel manufacturers were also involved in the program as they came forward to partner with CCR as the CCR clothing partner by providing the T shirts under their brand RBN.
CCR was formed on May 3, 2015 by a single athlete, Omar Alif who sought a community with which to share his passion of running. Stemming from this simple desire, he built up a vision that has since been shared by numerous like-minded athletes based in Colombo.
The group has now evolved into a team that goes beyond recreational running with most members preparing to participate in competitive marathons and other fitness competitions both in Sri Lanka as well as abroad. The program commenced with Lewis Chalk making a presentation on Preparation for the upcoming Colombo Marathon 2016.
We are delighted to be involved with CCR in their endeavors to promote fitness and healthy living, both of which are synonymous with our brand, said MD Stafford Garments, Shakir Hafeez.
Presently, the majority of the CCR community is preparing for the LSR Colombo Marathon in October 2016 and other international events such as the Penang Marathon in November 2016. At present our membership comprises 340+ individuals, of which the vast majority are male and female locals and expatriates living in Colombo. Members all share a passion for running, fitness, healthy-living and the outdoors, are professionals working in a range of fields, and span a range of ages. Due to the growing profile of CCR particularly through social media, CCR has also hosted a number of tourists who have a passion for running and exploring new cities.

Red Bull Kart Fight on July 9-10
After two seasons of intense wheel-to-wheel action, Red Bull Kart Fight returns to sunny Sri Lanka for an all-new, all-out race to find the islands best amateur karter on July 9 and 10.
Red Bull Kart Fight is an amateur karting competition that gives drivers across the country the chance to experience the smell of burning rubber for real.
The first edition of Red Bull Kart Fight in Sri Lanka was held in 2012, and was the first international pro-karting event of its kind in the country. Eshan Siriwardena, who emerged victorious after three stages of high-speed action on a custom track around Independence Square, went on to represent Sri Lanka at the Red Bull Kart Fight World Finals in Italy.
More recently in 2015, Hafzel Preena was crowned National Champion after racing through the lush Kanway Autodrome in Mirigama, winning an exclusive tour of the Red Bull Racing Factory and an experience at the Silverstone Circuit in England.
Karters will once again start their engines on the tropical tarmac in Mirigama and battle for a spot in the coveted national finals for this years edition of Red Bull Kart Fight. The King of the Circuit and this years National Champion will drive away with Rs. 200,000 in prize money. This will be followed by the second and third place winning Rs. 100,000 and Rs. 50,000 respectively.
Racing back at Kanway Autodrome, Mirigama is not going to be easy  I am sure drivers from last year are going to be back to compete for the title of King of the Circuit said Hafzel Preena, who is looking to defend his title of National Champion.
Over the years, Red Bull has been instrumental in cultivating a novice racing culture in Sri Lanka, said Shane Gunawardena. These racers are fueled by a competitive rush of adrenalin that demonstrates the immense potential of Sri Lankas budding motorsport talent and I believe Red Bull Kart Fight is the perfect platform to take their skills to the next level.

Murray, Federer, Serena cruise, Cibulkova eyes wedding blues
London, Monday: Andy Murray, Roger Federer and Serena Williams cruised into the Wimbledon last eight on Manic Monday as Dominika Cibulkova pondered cancelling her wedding following her shock run to the quarter-finals.
Murray racked-up his 50th Wimbledon match win while Federer reached the quarter-finals for the 14th time as the top two remaining seeds edged closer to a dream title match.
Second seeded Murray, the 2013 champion, eased to a 7-5, 6-1, 6-4 win over fiery Australian Nick Kyrgios and will next face French 12th seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.
Federer went equal with Jimmy Connors mark of 14 quarter-finals at Wimbledon and tied Martina Navratilovas all-time Slam record of 306 match wins by seeing off Steve Johnson of the United States 6-2, 6-3, 7-5.
Kyrgios, the 15th seed who defeated Rafael Nadal at the tournament in 2014, did not force a break point on Murrays serve as he slipped to his fifth loss in five meetings against the world number two.
The first set was very tight. I managed to get the break at 6-5 but it was very tight up to that point, explained Murray.
Kyrgios condemned his own performance.
The first set was OK but after that it was pathetic, said the 21-year-old.
Seven-time champion Federer, the third seed, next takes on Croatias Marin Cilic for a place in the semi-finals.
Cilic, the ninth seeded Croat, progressed to his third successive Wimbledon quarter-final when Japanese fifth seed Kei Nishikori pulled out of their last-16 clash with a rib injury in the second set.
Federer has a 5-1 record over Cilic but the big-server stunned the 17-time major champion in the US Open semi-finals in 2014 on his way to his maiden Grand Slam title.
He blew me off the court and I hope to get him back, said 34-year-old Federer.
Sam Querrey followed up his shock defeat of defending champion Novak Djokovic by beating French veteran Nicolas Mahut 6-4, 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 to reach his first Grand Slam quarter-final.
Querrey, the 28th seed, is the first American in the last-eight at Wimbledon since Mardy Fish in 2011.
Querrey will next face Canadian sixth seed Milos Raonic, who came back from two sets down for the first time in his career to beat Belgiums David Goffin.
Raonic, a Wimbledon semi-finalist in 2014, won 4-6, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.
In an all-Czech match-up, world number 64 Jiri Vesely and 10th seeded 2010 runner-up Tomas Berdych were tied at two sets each when play was halted for the night.
Vesely had saved five match points.
The winner faces French 32nd seed Lucas Pouille, who made the last eight of a Slam for the first time by seeing off Bernard Tomic, 6-4, 4-6, 3-6, 6-4, 10-8.
Cibulkova could be forced to postpone her wedding after knocking out world number three Agnieszka Radwanska.
Cibulkova is due to marry fiance Miso Navara in her hometown of Bratislava on Saturday.
But the confetti and wedding cake might be put on hold because the Slovakian 19th seed has advanced to the quarter-finals with a 6-3, 5-7, 9-7 victory against Radwanska.
Cibulkovas walk down the aisle will have to wait if she defeats Russian world number 50 Elena Vesnina in Tuesdays quarter-finals.
If I win, then we will change it. We will postpone it because it will be a lot of rush, Cibulkova said.
Vesnina won 5-7, 6-1, 9-7 against compatriot Ekaterina Makarova, who is her long-term doubles partner.
World number one Williams hit 43 winners and served 14 aces as she won the last nine games on Centre Court to remain on course for a record-equalling 22nd major title and a seventh Wimbledon crown. She has played really well against me in the past and she beat me earlier this year so I know that I had to play really well to win this, Williams said of the Kuznetsova clash.
The 34-year-old, an eight-time Wimbledon finalist, will next play Russian 21st seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, a 6-3, 6-3 winner over Coco Vandeweghe of the United States.
Venus now faces Kazakhstans Yaroslava Shvedova, a 6-2, 6-4 winner over Czech 28th seed Lucie Safarova.
German fourth seed and Australian Open champion Angelique Kerber cruised into her third Wimbledon quarter-final with a 6-3, 6-1 thrashing of Japanese world number 49 Misaki Doi.
Kerber plays Romanias Simona Halep, who fought back to reach her second Wimbledon quarter-final with a 6-7 (5/7), 6-4, 6-3 win against American ninth seed Madison Keys.

Ronaldo, Bale share mentality not just talent - Coleman
Wales boss Chris Coleman hailed Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bales mental strength ahead of a showdown between the two Real Madrid stars when Wales face Portugal in their Euro 2016 semi-final on Wednesday.
Coleman said he has received glowing reports about the three-time Player of the Year from Welsh legend Ryan Giggs and Ronaldos former manager at Manchester United Alex Ferguson.
However, he believes Bale, who has scored three goals in leading Wales to their first ever major semi-final in France, has worked just as hard to become the most expensive player in the world.
If I ever speak to Giggsy or Alex all they speak about is his (Ronaldos) desire to get better, said Coleman.
You see that on the pitch, how motivated he is for himself to score and win. I think ever since he was young at Man Utd he had that desire to train harder than everyone to get better.
Talent is a huge distraction, talent is not enough but he has the attitude with it, same as Bale he has the mentality to go with it.
Captain Ashley Williams insisted Wales will not obsess over stopping Ronaldo, but acknowledged the size of the challenge.
Obviously he is one of the greatest players in the world, but they do have other weapons, said the Swansea City defender.
We are not obsessing over him, we will try to nullify them as a team as we have all tournament. AFP

Troubled Rio hits one month countdown to Olympics
Rio de Janeiro, Tuesday: A crime-plagued, cash-strapped Rio de Janeiro on Tuesday enters the one-month countdown to becoming the first South American city to host the Olympics.
Stadiums are all ready -- barring finishing touches -- and within weeks, Brazil expects to greet at least 500,000 tourists for the August 5-21 Games.
The mayor, Eduardo Paes, and Brazil's Olympic committee boss Carlos Nuzman were to give a news conference marking the milestone in Rio's epic effort to transform from a beautiful but crumbling city to glittering stage for the world's most-watched event.
"The city is 100 percent ready. It's an unbelievable city. I'm very proud of our city," Paes said Monday at the presentation of a new bus expressway, part of an overhaul to the overburdened transportation system.
Some 10,000 athletes will compete over 19 days in Rio, ranging from familiar sports icons such as sprinter Usain Bolt and swimmer Michael Phelps to the stars of Olympic newbie sport rugby sevens and golf, which returns after more than a century's absence.
But despite growing excitement in the sporting world and the visible transformation of Olympic sites in Rio, a mounting series of problems are overshadowing the Games.
The authorities will deploy 85,000 police backed by soldiers on Rio's streets. That's twice as many as used in the 2012 London Olympics.
Terrorism is a serious concern after the Islamic State group demonstrated its geographical reach, with bombings in Istanbul and Baghdad blamed on the group in the last few days.
Brazil's distance from jihadist hot spots, coupled with the country's absence from wars, is expected to be the main factor on security forces' side.
However, Rio already faces its own serious violent crime that has embarrassed Olympic organizers trying to change the city's image.
Although down from horrific levels a decade ago, the murder rate is on the rise and street crime is also proliferating, symbolized by the hijacking of a truck filled with German television equipment last week.Police -- heavily criticized by human rights groups over their brutal tactics in slums known as favelas -- are themselves coming under deadly fire. More than 50 Rio state police have been killed this year. AFP

Venus, Kerber set-up Wimbledon semi-final clash
LONDON, TUESDAY: Five-time champion and nostalgic favourite Venus Williams on Tuesday reached her first Wimbledon semi-final in seven years, setting up a clash with Australian Open champion Angelique Kerber.
Venus, 36, is the oldest womens semi-finalist since Martina Navratilova in 1994 as she also moved a step closer to a final showdown with her sister and defending champion Serena Williams.

The American veteran, seeded eight, enjoyed a 7-6 (7/5), 6-2 victory over Kazakhstans world number 96 Yaroslava Shvedova. German fourth seed Kerber, meanwhile, reached her second Wimbledon semi-final with a 7-5, 7-6 (7/2) win over Simona Halep, the fifth seed from Romania.
Tuesdays other quarter-finals see six-time champion Serena face Russian 21st seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Slovak 19th seed Dominika Cibulkova, who is due to get married on Saturday, meets unseeded Elena Vesnina of Russia.
Venus, who won the last of her seven Grand Slam titles at Wimbledon in 2008, is back in the last-four of a Grand Slam for the first time since the 2010 US Open.
Eight-time Wimbledon finalist Venus trails 3-2 in her five career meetings with 28-year-old Kerber, who won their only meeting on grass in the 2012 Olympics at Wimbledon.
Oh wow, what a tough day on the court. It seemed she was going to win the tie-break but somehow I walked out with the set, Venus said.
She was on fire, but when you can walk to the net as the winner thats the dream.
I love playing the game. When you are winning matches it makes it that much sweeter. You cant always have these big moments. I guess if you are Serena
Williams it happens a lot, but for Venus Williams this is an awesome day. The first set tiebreak was key for Venus on Tuesday as she over-turned a 2/5 deficit before Shvedovas game fell apart in th second.
Kerber, meanwhile, is now in sight of becoming the new world number one -- although she needs to win the title while seeing Serena fail to make the semi-finals. AFP

Morgan says Bangladesh tour a concern
England have major concerns about the planned tour to Bangladesh later this year, the teams limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan has said in the wake of Fridays attack by gunmen at an upmarket Dhaka restaurant that left 20 dead.
An England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) spokesman said they would follow government advice on the trip to the South Asian country, where the team were due to play three one-day internationals and two tests from Oct. 7 to Nov. 1.
I think it is quite a big concern at the moment, Morgan told reporters. Weve always left the big decisions to the ECB. They write reports, send guys out to see if its safe then come back to the players to see if theyre happy or unhappy. But certainly its a concern at the moment. Security concerns have been a major issue in South Asia, starving Pakistan of international sports at home, while the Australian cricket team postponed their Bangladesh tour last year and then pulled out of the under-19 World Cup following a warning from their government.

Heated argument at COPE meeting over AGs report
The differences of opinions on the Auditor Generals report on the Central Bank Treasury Bonds issuance led to a heated argument at the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) meeting yesterday at the Parliamentary Complex.
The COPE met at 2.30 pm at a Committee Room to discuss the AGs report that was handed over last Wednesday. A stormy meeting ensued as UNP MPs representing the COPE argued in favour of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran while other members debated against him.
UNP MP M.Velukumar reportedly resigned from the COPE. However, COPE sources said that the resignation was a move to appoint UNP MP Sujeewa Senasinghe to the membership. MP Velu Kumar was not present yesterday but had informed of his willingness to resign.
The UNP members in the COPE had argued that Mahendran was not responsible for the alleged loss of the Treasury Bonds sale. They were of opinion that Mahendran was only implementing a policy decision of the government.
The JVP MPs countering this argument demanded to know from which office that policy decision had been made. They also pointed out that such a policy decision should be approved by the Monetary Board and there was no such approval.
Thereafter the UNP members in the COPE stated that they could not accept the AGs report, adding that it should be referred to independent experts for their opinion. They said that independent economic experts should be summoned to the COPE and they be given ample time to express their opinion on the AGs report.
The JVP MPs had protested and responded that if the UNP MPs needed expert opinion they could wait till July 7 as the COPE is to meet the CB Governor and the Monetary Board Officials on Thursday. The JVP MPs had pointed out to the UNP members that COPE could seek the expert opinion from them. The JVP MPs accused the UNP COPE members of deliberately attempting to delay the COPE investigations.
The COPE meeting presided by its Chairman Sunil Handunnetti was attended by members Dayasiri Jayasekera, Ravindra Samaraweera, Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Harsha de Silva, Ajith P Perera, Ranjan Ramanayake, Ashoka Abeysinghe, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Lakshman Seneviratne, Bimal Ratnayake, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Chandrasiri Gajadheera, Hector Appuhamy, Dr.Nalinda Jayatissa and Harshana Rajakaruna.
The UNP MPs had also attended a meeting held by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on the previous day on the same issue.

JO member lambastes Al Hussein
What moral right has the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein to interfere in the countrys internal affairs by suggesting a hybrid special court led by international judges to be incorporated into the proposed new Constitution, asked UPFA MP Niroshan Premarathna.
The MP addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday said the Human Rights Chief has expressed this proposal presenting an oral update on Sri Lanka to the ongoing 32nd sessions of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva last month.
We totally oppose it. We will not allow to set up courts to fulfill the needs of Western nations. Al Hussein has come here to take our war heroes to the guillotine, but we wont allow that to happen, he said.
Al Hussein has also said that the Sri Lankan Parliament adopted a resolution establishing a constitutional assembly to create a new constitution to go for a referendum in 2017.
Premarathna questioned as to how the Human Rights Chief could call for a referendum on Constitutional reforms process where even the government has not announced any such move to hold a such a referendum.
The government is engaged in imprisoning patriotic forces. MP Udaya Gammanpila and Media spokesperson of the National Freedom Front, Mohammed Muzammil have been remanded because they oppose bringing in a federal constitution. The government and a section of the Opposition have already given their consent to a federal Constitution and only the Joint Opposition has opposed this suggestion, he said.
Earlier, the JVP was the first to oppose the government when it was going on the wrong path. But, the situation has changed and the JVP is today engaged in protecting and promoting the FCID. It is shameful, Premarathna said.
Today, Buddhist monks are jailed and there is a witch hunt against the war heroes under the guise of the Commission of Inquiry into Disappearances. The 6.2 million voters, artists and civil society members who voted for the government in 2016 are now ready to bring it down, he said.
The MP said all members of the Joint Opposition have agreed on the new political force led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa with an operational role for former Minister Basil Rajapaksa.
The government is scared of Basil Rajapaksa because he is a good manager. We made certain mistakes last time, but now we have rectified all the mistakes and come on the correct path. We will face local government elections as a separate group and all further elections will be contested under the same force. We already have a large number of provincial politicians supporting our cause, he added.

Financial Transactions Reporting Act to be amended
The Financial Transactions Reporting Act No 6 of 2006 (FIRA) is scheduled to be amended during 2016, National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Niroshan Perera said.
He was responding to a question raised by UPFA Minister Vasudeva Nanayakkara in Parliament yesterday.
Following a decision taken at the meeting of the Advisory Board to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), a committee was established to review the current legislation relating to money laundering and terrorist financing and to propose amendments in line with global developments, he said.
According to the State Minister, the committee comprises the representatives of the Attorney Generals Department, Legal Draftsman Department, Financial Intelligence Unit, Finance Ministry, National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry and the Police.
The State Minister said the amendments proposed to the FTRA are at an advanced stage, with the draft to be revisited by the Legal Draftsmans Department and to be submitted for the Attorney Generals clearance.
The powers and functions of the Financial Intelligence Unit are mandated by virtue of three laws, namely, the Financial Transaction Reporting Act No. 6 of 2006, Prevention of Money Laundering and the Conversation on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act, No 25 of 2005, he said.
He said the FIU is empowered to collect information of the bank accounts maintained by Sri Lankans in foreign jurisdictions only to establish the conduct of unlawful activities as specified under the Financial Transaction Reporting Act, No 6 of 2006 or an offence of money laundering or financing of terrorism as respectively referred to in the Prevention of Money Laundering Act No 5 of 2006 and the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act, No 25 of 2005.
Collection of any information from foreign jurisdiction is subject to laws and regulations applicable to respective foreign jurisdictions, the State Minister said.
He said the FIU does not have the power to arbitrarily collect information or carry out a survey, to establish the number of Sri Lankans that have opened foreign bank accounts or amounts under their names in such accounts.
Homoeopathy Bill passed with amendments
The Homoeopathy Bill was passed in Parliament yesterday with amendments.
The Bill was presented by Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne on June 7. The Bill replaces the Homoeopathy Act of 1970.
The new Act provides for the establishment of a Homoeopathic Medical Council; for the registration of Homoeopathic Practitioners and Homoeopathic Pharmacists; for the registration and regulation of Homoeopathic Institutions; to promote, foster, and regulate the Homoeopathic system of medicine and for the regulation and control of the manufacture, importation, storage, sale and distribution of homoeopathic medicine, drugs and other homoeopathic preparations.
The Minister moving the Bill for the debate, said the Homoeopathy Act had not been amended for 45 years, adding that the new Bill addresses the loopholes of the previous legislation. He said about 150-200 patients obtain treatments at the Welisara Homoeopathy hospital daily mainly for joint pains, asthma, child and women illnesses.
Unlike western medical treatment that provides external immunisation, the Homoeopathy treatment enhances natural immunisation in the body. Medicine used in Homoeopathy is made of natural substances such as herbs and parts of animals. Adverse effects in them are low, he said.
The medicine is also comparatively cheap and easy to use. We need to encourage the promotion of the Homoeopathy medical system, he said.
Tourism industry gathers momentum
The first quarter of this year has shown a significant growth in the tourism sector, the Quarterly Report on the Economy tabled in Parliament yesterday stated.
The report was tabled by Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka on behalf of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
As of the report, the arrival of tourists had gone up by 22.1 percent. The income from tourism had increased by USD 969.3 million.
The report indicates that the inflation of the country had increased according to three main indexes. Headline Inflation (year-on-year) based on the Colombo Consumers Price Index (CCPI, 2006/7=100) increased to 4.8 percent in May 2016 from 3.13 percent in April, 2016.
The annual average inflation increased to 1.7 percent in May 2016 from 1.3 percent recorded in the previous month. Based on CCPI, year-on-year core inflation, which measures underlying inflation in the economy, increased to 6.6 percent in May 2016 compared to 4.5 percent in April 2016.
Following a similar trend, the annual average core inflation increased to 4.5 percent in May 2016 from 4.1 percent in the previous month, the report said.
Headline inflation (year-on-year) based on the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100) which covers all provisions in the country, increased to 4.3 percent in April 2016 from 2.2 percent in March 2016.
The annual average inflation edged upto 2.6 percent in April 2016 from 2.4 percent recorded in the previous month, it said.
Earnings from exports declined by 5.4 percent, year-on year, to US dollars 2,728 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to US dollars 2,884 million recorded in the first quarter of 2015, largely due to the impact of the weak global demand.
Export earnings of transport equipment, petroleum products, gems, diamonds and jewellery, spices and tea mainly contributed to this decline, according to the report.
The rupee recorded a depreciation of 1.3 percent against the US dollar during 2016 upto June 6, the report added.
The report stated the economic growth in 2015 had been 4.8 percent and that there had been growth in the agriculture, industry and service sectors.
About 3,136 acres in North and East released for resettlement since 2015

M. Swaminathan said.
It said upto now 1,578 families comprising 4,046 persons were resettled.

MP proposes exam for SAITM students to win medical practice
UPFA Galle District Parliamentarian Ramesh Pathirana yesterday proposed the government to introduce an examination similar to Act 15 for SAITM students to allow them to practise medicine in Sri Lanka.
He made this proposal joining the debate on the Second Reading of the Homeopathy Bill. This is the only way of ensuring justice for SAITM graduates without damaging the quality and the reputation of countrys medical profession.
The continuous struggle of the medical students and the medical professionals is not against SAITM students, but against the procedure followed by the SAITM.
As a medical professional, I do not oppose private medial institutions since we can save a large amount of money spent on foreign medical degrees. But there should be a proper regulatory mechanism to regulate these institutions, the MP said.
