New Sri Lanka Golf Union committee keen to push the sport among schoolchildren
Where Eagles Dare could well become the catchword for the next generation of local golf luminaries if Harsha Abeywickrema, the newly elected president of Sri Lanka Golf Union, has any say. And he is determined to make his presence at the helm of the proud 72-year-old institution count.
We, the newly-elected committee, wants to raise the standards of the game in Sri Lanka. And we want to do a thorough job, stressed Abeywickrema, the former head of the Sri Lanka Air Force.
Earlier this month at the annual general meeting of the Sri Lanka Golf Union, Air Chief Marshal Abeywickrema was elected unopposed as president. His team includes Sanjeeva Vairawanathan (vice-president), Nishan Navaratne (hon secretary), Sudath Kumara (treasurer), Usha de Silva (asst. secretary) and Naveen Gunaratne (asst. treasurer).
The Air Chief Marshal has a formula all worked out in his head: to use the three golf courses he had a hand in building during his tenure in the Air Force as key facilities to promote the sport amongst schoolchildren in the area.
Built on Sri Lanka Air Force land, the three courses obviously have an Eagle in its name  Eagles Golf Links, an 18-hole scenic course at the SLAF Academy in China Bay, Trincomalee; Eagles Heritage Golf Club, 9-holes, at the SLAF base in Anuradhapura; and Eagles Catalina, 9-holes, at the SLAF base in Koggala.
I created these golf courses during my time in the Air Force and they are now proving to be an invaluable asset for the sport and the Sri Lanka Golf Union. The aim is to get schools in these areas to try their hand at golf so that we can identify talent, says Abeywickrema.
The new committee has joined hands with banking giant HSBC and launched the Future Lions programme targeting schoolchildren in Anuradhapura, Trincomalee and Koggala. Move over Tiger Woods, the Lions are in the hunt.
The massive backing from the Sri Lanka Air Force for golf has had a ripple effect among the other branches of the Armed Forces with the Sri Lanka Army and the Sri Lanka Navy also getting involved with providing courses in Diyatalawa and Welisara respectively.
The development push will go into over-drive when HSBC and Sri Lanka Golf launches its second Future Lions programme at the end of this month where 480 schoolchildren aged 10 to 14 years will get an opportunity to get into the swing of things with a golf club in their hands.
The programme, which will also involve the Ministry of Sport and the National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka, will begin at the Eagles Golf Links in Trincomalee and end at the course run by Shangri La in Hambantota.
At the end of the day, if we are able to identify even a handful of young talent, it will be worth it. For too long golf has been neglected for various reasons. I want everyone to come together for the good of the game and support us, Abeywickrema added.
It seems the Eagle has landed for local golf.

Peter Handscomb breaks silence on ball-tampering controversy
Australian cricketer Peter Handscomb on Friday denied that he was involved in ball-tampering during the Test series against South Africa in March.
The test batsman claimed that the video was edited, in which he appeared to have talked to his coach Darren Lehman through a walkie-talkie before going into the field to deliver a message to bowler Cameron Bancroft.
It's actually amazing how much the media edited it (video footage). It shows me on the walkie-talkie then running out talking to Cameron, Cricket.com.au quoted Handscomb, as saying.
In a video that went viral on social media, Bancroft was seen rubbing what looked like sandpaper against the ball. On spotting Bancroft apparently altering the condition of the ball, coach Lehmann allegedly instructed something to Handscomb via walkie-talkie. After this, Handscomb was shown talking and laughing with Bancroft on the field, following which Bancroft hid what appeared to be a sandpaper inside his pants. I get put into a catching position next to Cameron ... and literally was just trying to have a joke with him, there was nothing else mate - so all this build up about me trying to do something there was just, it wasn't there, he added. The batsman did not disclose the details of the conversation he had with the coach, saying it had already been well documented. Following the ball-tampering controversy, then Australian skipper Steve Smith and opening batsman David Warner were handed a ban for a year from the Australian cricket, Cameron Bancroft was suspended for nine months.

Rashid hits back at Vaughan over stupid comments
London, Friday: England leg-spinner Adil Rashid has hit back at Michael Vaughan after the former captain described his selection for the first Test against India as ridiculous.
Rashid was included in a 13-man squad even though he has opted out of playing first-class County Championship cricket for Yorkshire this season.
His selection for next weeks first Test on the back of his one-day form has not gone down well with Vaughan, an ex-teammate of Rashids for Yorkshire, who described his selection as stab in the back for county cricket.
If they treat me like they have done, dont see any value in me and are disrespectful to me, I have to think about the future in terms of which county I play for,
Writing in the Telegraph newspaper, he added: It basically says our county game, the finishing school for our cricketers, does not matter any more and that it is irrelevant.
Rashid, who won the last of his 10 Test caps in Chennai more than 18 months ago, said Vaughan was talking nonsense and said his opinions did not matter to anybody.
When I mentioned at the start of the year I will not be playing red-ball cricket, he tweeted something then, he said in an interview with the BBC. He was being controversial and saying his stupid things then too.
I dont think he has an agenda against me. I played under and with him but sometimes ex-players come out and start talking nonsense about current players.
There will be people out there who are not happy. There will be haters, like the pundits who are saying it is a disgrace. That is not my fault.
Vaughan could not resist another dig at Rashid on Friday, tweeting: I am stupid for wanting someone to prepare to play the No1 Test team in the world by playing a 4 day game with the red ball.
Yorkshire chief executive Mark Arthur said the county were very surprised by Rashids recall.
The player responded by casting doubt on his future at Headingley.
If they treat me like they have done, dont see any value in me and are disrespectful to me, I have to think about the future in terms of which county I play for, said Rashid.
National selector Ed Smith has made it clear that in order to be eligible for Test selection next year Rashid must return to the domestic four-day game. AFP

Rice is Life
Rice is the staple food of more than half of the worlds seven billion population. However, more than 90% of this rice is consumed in Asia, where it is a staple for a majority of the population, including the regions 560 million hungry people. The success of the Green Revolution in the early 1960s witnessed a steady rise in Asias per capita rice consumption from 85 kilograms per year in the early 60s to nearly 103 kilograms in the early 90s.
The world average annual per capita consumption of rice is 57.2 Kgs and forecasted value for the year 2024, is 58.4 Kgs with showing stability. The major consuming region as Asia and Pacific, the annual per capita consumption is 84.9 and is projected to 86.8 Kgs in the year 2024 with a slight increase. The annual per capita rice consumption is the highest in countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines and ranges 122 Kgs to 191 Kgs per person. Food and rice expenditures account for a high share of household expenditure with rice alone accounting for 75 per cent of total calorie needs in Cambodia.

Among all the foods and beverages, rice has long been the star in Sri Lanka and the recorded history of rice consumption in the island goes back to the arrival of Prince Vijaya in the 6th Century BC. The nutritional characteristics of rice vary mainly according to the post-harvest activities. Among them, particularly influential are the type of processing, the degree of milling, storage, and cooking practices. Although rice can be consumed after the different degree of transformation, it also depends on the consumer taste. Nearly half of the total daily calorie intake of an average person in Sri Lanka comes from this food item 
The rice consumption norm used by Cambodia for food budget planning exercises is high at 153 kg per capita per annum. The average annual consumption of rice per person fell to 61.8 kilograms in 2017, from 71.2 kg, 2011 in Korea. Meanwhile, the rice consumption has doubled in the US over the last 20 years. Current intake of rice in the US is approximately 21.2 pounds per capita/year, with more than 70% being enriched, fortified white rice. This may be the result of a public emphasis on healthy lifestyles, the rising demand for gluten-free foods, or continued introduction and domestic use of new rice-based products. Like most Asian governments, Sri Lanka still views rice as a strategic commodity due to its importance in the diet of the poor in employment and income generation of farmers. Paddy is cultivated in almost all parts of the country, except at very high altitudes. It is the main contributor to the rural economy, as the majority of rural households are engaged in rice production as their main or supplementary source of livelihood. The relationship between Sri Lankan life and rice cultivation is so intimate, that it permeates all aspects of Sri Lankan culture and history.
Among all the foods and beverages, rice has long been the star in Sri Lanka and the recorded history of rice consumption in the island goes back to the arrival of Prince Vijaya in the 6th Century BC. The nutritional characteristics of rice vary mainly according to the post-harvest activities. Among them, particularly influential are the type of processing, the degree of milling, storage, and cooking practices. Although rice can be consumed after the different degree of transformation, it also depends on the consumer taste. Nearly half of the total daily calorie intake of an average person in Sri Lanka comes from this food item. And rice is also a major source of protein and it contains a substantial amount of zinc and niacin.
Paddy/Rice sector plays a vital role in the economy of Sri Lanka by providing livelihood to nearly 0.9 million farm families island-wide. After 2009 the countrys paddy production gradually increased due to the increase of the contribution to the national production from the Eastern and Northern provinces as a result of the ending of the prolonged war. During the period of 2008-2015, the country was able to achieve self-sufficiency in rice and produce more than the requirement in almost all years. In the year 2015 paddy production of the country reached the ever highest in history, which was 4.8 million metric tons. Sri Lanka ranks well among South Asian countries in terms of rice productivity. The present rice productivity is nearly 4.3 Mt/Ha and it was a more than six-fold increase after the independence.
Today, patterns of cultivation, marketing, and consumption of rice are changing faster than ever before. Yet there are strong forces working to stabilize and conserve rice systems. Key factors that affect the demand for rice are income, prices, population growth and urbanization in different ways. As income rises, consumers tend to shift from standard-quality rice to high-quality rice. The political economy of rice is changing, and that shapes rice production and consumption. Rice remains a strategic food security crop for policymakers and voters. There are tremendous variations in tastes and preferences for rice across the world. The demand for rice is shifting from lower-quality rice to higher-quality rice.
Demand for food commodities
The ratio of expenditure on food and drink to total expenditure is called food ratio. According to the 2016 report, the average food ratio is 34.8% in Sri Lanka and the sectoral composition is 31.2% in urban, 35.4% in rural and 48.5 in the estate sector. This implies that a household in the estate sector spends nearly 50 per cent of its expenditure on food. Among low-income groups, the percentage expenditure on rice is comparably higher.
The Household Income and Expenditure Survey of the Department of Census and Statistics revealed that the expenditure on rice as a percentage of total food expenditure in 2006/07, 2009/10, 2012/13 and 2016 was 13.9, 17.3, 13.6 and 12.5 per cent respectively. Changing prices, income, and other socio-economic factors have many implications for the demand for food commodities at household and country levels.
Per capita consumption of rice is an important indicator when analyzing the rice flow of the country within different sectors and within different income levels. According to the various Household Income and Expenditure Surveys, the annual per capita rice consumption was 103.7 kg, 107.9 kg, 108.8 kg, 107.8 kg and 104.5 in 1986/87, 2006/07, 2009/10, 2012/13 and 2016 respectively. It shows an increase, stabilizing and slightly declining trend during the last four decades of the period.
According to the consumption data, household rice consumption has declined over the decades in the urban sector from 1980 to 2016. The rural sector also shows a reduction of rice consumption during the period of 1980-2016. However, during that period consumption in the estate sector shows stability. In 1980/81 monthly household consumption of rice was 40.9 Kgs and it has declined in 2016 to 36.00 Kgs. When considering the variety of wise monthly rice consumption, raw rice is the highest at nearly 15 Kgs in 2016 survey. The rice consumption pattern among the sectors, households in rural sector show the highest consumption of Kekulu rice (raw red and white) and household in urban sector consumed the lowest quantity of Kekulu rice (raw red and white).
Regional variation of rice consumption
In Sri Lanka, two types of rice varieties are mainly grown: short grain (Samba) and long grain (Nadu) varieties. There is another categorization based on the type of processing; parboiled and raw (Kekulu). Statistics reveal that overall parboiled rice consumption represents 54.3% of the total rice consumption. Nadu consumption is dominant among parboiled rice consumers. However, there is a significant variation in rice consumption by varieties when provinces are considered. When provincial data is considered, it varies from 22.3 in the Northern province to 42 kg in Uva province.
This variation is mainly due to a change in consumption habits resulting from urbanization and ethnic differences. For instance, Tamil community residing in Northern Province consumed non-rice foods mainly made of black gram flour or wheat flour in addition to rice. In the Western province, rice consumption is relatively low due to urbanization. Urban consumers consume diverse foods due to convenience in preparation and increased incomes. Its clear that the highest and the lowest consumption of rice have been recorded from Uva and Northern provinces respectively. The highest and the lowest Kekulu rice consumption was also recorded from Uva and Northern provinces respectively. When considering the samba rice consumption, the highest and the lowest consumption has noted from the Western and Uva provinces respectively. Parboiled Nadu rice consumption is high in North Western and North Central provinces. The lowest consumption of Nadu rice has also been recorded from Uva province.
Need of value addition to rice
While significant gains have been made in relation to poverty reduction and development in Sri Lanka, under-nutrition still affect a considerable number of people who survive on less than the minimum kcal per day in some rural and estate sector DS divisions. Rice is the major source of daily calorie intake source of all Sri Lankans. In some rural and estate sector, DS Divisions poverty rates are still high and a number of poor people exist. Those peoples are the highly vulnerable groups in terms of food security, especially during the peak rice pricing periods.
According to the Demographic and Health Survey, 2016, among under-five childrens 17.3% are stunted, 15.1% are wasting and 20.5% underweight. In some rural and estate sector areas, the rates are extremely high. Under-nutrition among women is still prevalent in the country. According to the Household Income and Expenditure Survey, 2012/13 the percentage of the population not receiving a minimum level of dietary energy consumption is 47.8. All those factors reveal that the need for nutritional intervention especially to the low-income poor populations in rural estate and urban sectors to increase the nutritional status of the people. One of the easiest ways for that is the increase of nutrition of the staple food rice. At present, the Ministry of Health and World Food Programme (WFP) initiate to scale up the food fortification programme. Rice fortification provides an avenue to help combat micronutrient deficiency. Some countries like Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Philippines and the United States produce fortified rice. Fortified rice kernels contain added micronutrients, but the look, the taste and cooking like ordinary rice. Therefore, fortified rice can deliver essential vitamins and minerals missing in many peoples meals, and can help ensure the poorest get the nutrition they need for an active and healthy life in their present diets. Another way of enhancing the nutritional levels of the people is promoting the consumption of traditional rice varieties like Suwandel, Kaluheenatiand Ma vee. Therefore, attention is needed for this type of interventions for enhancing the upgrading of rice utilization to ensure the food and nutritional security of the nation. Food demand patterns of a particular country play a vital role in developing policies. They assist to improve the nutritional status of individuals and households through identifying the most appropriate policy interventions. It is clear that as a staple food, rice consumption behaviour is very important when formulating the intervention policies related to the food security.

Six-match ban  for  Danushka  Gunathilaka
Sri Lanka's cricket board Friday slapped a six-match ban on batsman Danushka Gunathilaka for breaching player rules as police investigated the alleged rape of a Norwegian woman in his hotel room.
Gunathilaka, 27, was questioned by police on Tuesday after his associate Sandeep Jude Selliah, 26, was accused of raping one of two Norwegian women with them in a room at the team hotel.
Police said Gunathilaka was not an accused, but a cricket board hearing found him guilty of breaching team discipline and violating his contract.
The incident is said to have happened in the early hours of Sunday just before Sri Lanka completed a Test win over South Africa.
SLC rules stipulate that during matches players must be in their hotel rooms by midnight and cannot have guests.
Sri Lanka Cricket decided to suspend Danushka Gunathilaka from six international cricket matches for breaching the 'Player Code of Conduct and Contractual Obligation', said a board statement. Gunathilaka will now miss five one-day internationals starting Sunday against South Africa and a one-off T20 match.
He had already been excluded from Sri Lanka's ODI squad pending the disciplinary hearing. Gunathilaka was already on probation for another transgression when the new charges were slapped over his conduct at the weekend.
The six-match ban takes into consideration a misconduct offence in October last year. Local media said that punishment came after he missed a training session following late-night partying.
Sri Lanka Cricket said he will forfeit his match fee for the second Test against South Africa and any other bonus payments for winning the two match series.
Gunathilaka and Selliah were with two Norwegian women at the team hotel in Colombo during the 2nd Test. One woman later accused the Selliah, a British passport-holder of Sri Lankan origin, of raping her. He was later arrested by police.

South Africa Emerging Players  on top in first unofficial test
South Africa Emerging Players took a stranglehold of the first 4-day unofficial test when they bowled out Sri Lanka Emerging Players for 194 and take a first innings lead of 200 at the end of the second day at Chilaw Marians grounds Katunayake yesterday.
Replying to the South African first innings total of 394-9 declared, Sri Lanka were bundled out rather cheaply with only youngsters Sammu Ashan and Chamika Karunaratne making any sort of impression with a half-century apiece.
Sri Lanka lost their first six wickets for 66 before Ashan and Karunaratne figured in a seventh wicket partnership of 84 to lend some stability to the batting. Ashan was out for a fine innings of 51 made off 84 balls with eight fours and a six and Karunaratne went onto top score with 61 off 96 balls with nine fours. Five bowlers took two wickets apiece to share the spoils for South Africa.
Earlier in the day South Africa resuming at the overnight score of 318-7 reached 394-9 before closing their innings. Left-arm spinner Muthumudalige Pushpakumara was the pick of the Lankan bowlers finishing with six wickets for 126 off 43 overs. At stumps South Africa were 10-1 in their second innings with Pushpakumara picking up another scalp.
The match continues on its third day today.

Scores: SA Emerging Players 318-7 contd 394-9 decl in 109.5 over (E Bosch 55, J Dawood 31 n.o., M Pushpakumara 6/126) and 10-1 in 4 overs at close.
SL Emerging Players 194 in 53.4 overs (S Ashan 51, C Karunaratne 61, N Burger 2/42, L Sipamia 2/32, E Bosch 2/28, J Dawood 2/23, O Nyaku 2/41)

Sri Lankan who stole rare US$ 20mn diamond in Dubai netted
Dubai police say theyve recovered a rare $20 million blue diamond that was stolen from a city companys vault and smuggled to Sri Lanka inside a pair of sneakers in a shoebox.
Police said Thursday a guard with the money transfer company secreted the diamond out of the vault on May 25 and passed it off to a relative who smuggled it out of the country.
After more than 100 interviews and the review of thousands of hours of CCTV footage,some showing the theft in progress, police say they were able to pinpoint the suspect.
After stealing the 9.33-carat diamond, the suspect handed it over to his relative to smuggle it in a shoe by sea. A video of the investigation released by the police shows an officer taking the sports shoe out of its box and recovering the pouch containing the diamond that is hidden inside.
The police arrested the Sri Lankan suspect, who was holed up in a neighbouring emirate after switching off his phone. Tracing him was no mean task as the police had to scour through more than 8,620 hours of surveillance camera footages and question over 120 people.Colonel Mohammed Aqil Ahli, deputy director of the department of criminal investigation, said the police were notified about the daring theft from the companys vault at its headquarters in Jebel Ali.
The company officials were baffled by the crime, as the suspect had to go through multiple layers of security gates to get to the vault. As per the security protocol in place, the number of employees authorised to pass through to the vault reduced with the passage of each gate.
The final gate could only be opened by three security guards together: The first had to have a key, the second a manual secret code and the third an electronic code that automatically changed frequently.
Despite these security precautions, the suspect managed to enter the vault and carry out the theft. After the police identified him, they came to know that he had cut off contact with all of his acquaintances. The police managed to trace him and arrested him.During his interrogation, the suspect told the police that he carried out the theft a week before he was to go on vacation. The plan was to escape to his home country to realise his dream of becoming a millionaire. (Khaleej Times)

## Title: Trump, CNN feud gets more bitter

Trump, CNN feud gets more bitter
US: Donald Trump has been at frequent loggerheads with CNN since taking office, but their feud has become increasingly bitter as the channel's acerbic White House coverage fuels a boom in viewers.
From reportedly raging that CNN was on the First Lady's television set, to refusing to take questions from the network, to the White House barring one of its reporters from a press event: the Trump-CNN relationship is toxic.
Donald Trump is doing what conservative politicians have been doing for a long time but which he is taking to a new level -- to use the press as a punching bag, and this plays very well with the conservative base, said Robert Jensen, who is retiring this fall as journalism professor at the University of Texas.
CNN's stated commitment to uncovering the truth, its household-name status and robust coverage of crises in the administration, broadcasting damaging headlines around the clock, have been a huge thorn in the president's side.
Fact-based reporting aside, eyebrows have been raised over the subjective nature of some of the commentary from its anchors, celebrities in their own right with a powerful following and multi-million-dollar contracts.
Earlier this month, Anderson Cooper called Trump's press conference with Vladimir Putin perhaps one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president.
In January, his colleague Don Lemon called Trump a racist. I think such comments by news people -- as distinguished from commentators -- are a mistake, says Paul Janensch, a former newspaper editor who taught journalism at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut.
If I were running CNN, I would tell the news professionals to stick to the facts and avoid making disparaging comments about Trump, he told AFP.
The network has recently promoted to prime-time Chris Cuomo, brother of Democratic New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and the anchor who this week broadcast a taped conversation involving Trump and his former personal lawyer.
There is that sense that CNN could be being watched by people who may be more undecided, still open to having their opinions and ideas shaped by the reporting, says Robert Thompson, a professor of television and popular culture.
It's still kind of doing the old- fashioned notion of reporter with some kind of objectivity... and I think that drives the president absolutely crazy, added Thompson, from the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University.
The Republican leader has long had a contentious relationship with the media, branding mainstream outlets an enemy of the American People and dismissing unfavorable coverage as Fake News.
But while Trump has railed against The New York Times, he has continued to speak to its reporters. He has not granted CNN an interview since he took office. CNN is fake news, I don't take questions from CNN, the president snapped during a press conference in Britain earlier this month. The Times reported that Trump raged at staff after his wife Melania's television on board Air Force One was tuned to CNN, not Fox. On Wednesday, the White House barred a CNN reporter from attending an event with the president, allegedly for asking inappropriate questions that officials objected to earlier in the day.
Yet others see no rational explanation for the extent of the president's ire. CNN is only the third-most watched cable news network, lagging behind Trump favorite, Fox News in first place and MSNBC, a bastion of liberal opposition. CNN president Jeff Zucker was previously at NBC Universal, the man who green-lighted reality show The Apprentice that turned Trump into a household name, ultimately paving the way for his successful run as President.
In the summer of 2015, when Trump announced his candidacy ran for president, CNN was criticized for airing his early rallies in full and unedited, as the New York real-estate tycoon leap-frogged to the front of a crowded Republican field.
Yet CNN, like other US media, has received a shot in the arm by the Trump administration. According to Nielsen data, the channel has just closed out its third-best second quarter since 1996.
If anything, his CNN obsession is increasing CNN's profile, says Edward Burmila, who teaches political science at Bradley University in Illinois. Any media outlet attracting that much anger from the White House is likely to gain something in terms of reputation in the industry. But whether CNN succeeds in treading a middle ground depends on who you ask, he told AFP.
Liberals tend to think CNN is bland and inoffensive. Conservatives think it's communist propaganda.

## Title: Why are the  All Blacks so good
## Supertitle:

## Date: Saturday, July 28, 2018 - 01:00
Why are the  All Blacks so good
Since the 2011 Rugby World Cup, New Zealand has boasted an 89% win record. Its an intimidating haul of results since it won that event on home soil, including a second consecutive World Cup title in 2015, the nations third overall.
No wonder the All Blacks are considered one of the most dominant teams in all of sport.
Throughout their history the All Blacks have been serial winners. But if you add in results since 2004, despite maintaining a similarly high win percentage (87.2%), hidden amongst the numbers are painful results.
Chiefly among them, a 2007 World Cup quarterfinal loss to France which rocked the nation. The Kiwis went into that tournament as red hot favorites having obliterated the British & Irish Lions two years before and dominated their southern hemisphere rivals in the build-up. Yet they came inexplicably unstuck.
New Zealand became the first side to retain the Rugby World Cup after defeating Australia 34-17 in the final at Twickenham Stadium.
Go just a little further back and its no more comfortable. In 2003, Australia defeated New Zealand in the World Cup semis. Then there was another semifinal loss in 1999, with the French villains again. What about those emotional scenes in 1995 as an inspired South Africa overcame the illness-riddled, Jonah Lomu-inspired All Blacks to lift the Webb Ellis trophy alongside Nelson Mandela
Once you get past New Zealands inaugural World Cup triumph in 1987 and add all of this up, you can understand why, in the mid 2000s, the All Blacks were considered serial chokers by many.
Yes -- winning two World Cups on the bounce, in 2011 and in England in 2015, will eradicate any negative label. But how did the nation right itself, not just holding onto the high win ratio but adding in trophies when it mattered most
EVOLVING OUT OF DISAPPOINTMENT
Talking to CNN on the eve of his very last Super Rugby outing for the Auckland Blues, two-time World Cup winning, 81-capper Jerome Kaino considers why things flipped.
I think a huge motivating factor in 2011 was being at home, he says, hesitantly at first. And as hard as it was, I think having the guys around from 2007, taking the learning from that tournament and applying it to our campaign in 2011 was a huge help.
Back-row forward Kaino added no-nonsense edge to a team of stars in both 2011 and 2015. In the black jersey he was a broadsword amongst rapiers. Not that his game was one-dimensional -- he has an impressive array of skills. Which is perhaps which leads him into his next point about the nations top rugby talents.
He says: I think the styles of the game -- the brand the All Blacks play -- definitely changes from year to year. Thats one thing Ive noticed in whats expected of other players. Thats down to the coaches lifting standards in what theyre expecting every year. I think its the evolution of how you play as a team and whats expected from forwards these days. Thats developed through the years. A lock forward no longer just carries the ball and cleans rucks -- there are other things, like the expectation to catch-pass. Expectations keep lifting from year to year.
Jerome Kaino scores for the All Blacks in the 2015 World Cup semifinal against South Africa.
I remember a time when locks didnt have to work on their acceleration, their footwork, their evasion skills or their catch-pass. Front-rowers just did their jobs, locks did their job, the forwards tackled all day and tried to steal ball.
But now youve got periods in the game where tight forwards are expected to do things like midfielders. The skill-set within players these days has definitely grown. I dont think you can put it down to changing one year, but you see the players coming through and theyre faster, stronger, and in time you realize, Hey, Ive got to start adding to my arsenal or Ill get left behind.
SHARE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Talk to many All Blacks about their aura that may intimidate other nations and they can come across bored. But Kaino gets a little more excited when he begins talking about rugby intelligence.
For him, it is a huge part of what makes New Zealand rugby tick. As he explains: Its also engrained in how our coaches coach the game. Theres always an element of thinking outside the box, having that point of difference with how players think and react and execute under pressure.From a school to semi-professional, and definitely in Super Rugby up to the All Blacks, theres a huge emphasis on how players react and how they execute their skills under pressure. Theres a lot of time and effort going into that, just as much as the physical training.
Kaino explains that even at school level, there will be visualization sessions mixed in with skills work.
His views on coaching are picked up by Chris Boyd. Currently with the Wellington Hurricanes, but soon to take the reigns at Northampton Saints in Englands Gallagher Premiership, the Super Rugby-winning coach agrees that there must be something going very well with Kiwi coaches -- its why Ireland, Wales, Georgia and others hire bosses from down under.
Boyd also explains that one of the keys is that the athletes are treated like prime commodities in New Zealand.
In Europe, there can be these little tte--ttes between clubs and country, he says. And while we grumble and grizzle, by and large we get it right and have the players [at the forefront].
Basically all the best athletes are there to choose from. Ideologically, weve made things very player-centric with our processes, which is at times holistic and long-term.
There is more. Enemies during the season can unite for a greater cause in New Zealand. Boyd says: We have a sharing of knowledge. We Super Rugby coaches compete like hell throughout the season but then we will have a conference together. Youre not giving away juicy on-field stuff, but over four or five days well be discussing leadership or training techniques and systems etc.
The franchises also have a very good relationship with the management of the national set-up.
MIND GAMES
Earlier this year, Glasgow Warriors assistant Jason OHalloran caught many unawares when he said: Thats the biggest area for growth in Scottish rugby, the whole sports psych thing. I dont think its done particularly well at all. Its often just seen as a bit of voodoo and witch-doctor stuff, which is where we were at in New Zealand probably 20 years ago.
What OHalloran is talking about is the ability to take constructive criticism and use it to shape your next moves. Another desirable trait is being able to move past errors, obstacles or ill-fortune and attack your next task. The stats show that the All Blacks, as a collective, have this down to an art.
Since 2004, the All Blacks have been losing at half-time in 42 out of the 188 games theyve played (22.3%). Of the 42 games, they won 28, drew one and only lost 13.
Although many of their biggest from-behind wins came pre-2007, one astounding result was when New Zealand came back from a whopping 15 points against Ireland in 2013 -- a heartbreaking moment for the Irish. Since 2012 there has also been strong evidence of ruthlessness at home.
On 10 occasions, the All Blacks have not conceded a single second-half point. Only 18 times since 2012 have the All Blacks conceded points in the third quarter of a Test; in fact theyve only let in 81 points in the third quarter during these years, while scoring 352 points in the third quarter themselves. On average, the All Blacks have only spent 12 minutes trailing their opposition since 2012.
In 2015, the man who led New Zealand to the title in 2011, Sir Graham Henry, told The Telegraphabout the use of psychology after 2007, saying: When you are under pressure your brain goes a different state and you end up running around like a headless chicken. All the players have individual cues to stay in the now on the field. If they feel themselves slipping they click on with that individual mental trigger to make them stay in the now. They practice that all the time.
This returns to what Kaino was explaining with visualization. He explains that the man who has masterminded the approach, Gilbert Enoka, is a key part of the team.
Enoka was part of my journey from day one there, and hes put in some great systems with the team and also a lot of individuals, says Kaino.
He tries to get to know everyone and how people operate. You cant sit there and make one blanket framework work for everyone.
He likes to see how people think, what works for individuals and you discuss with them a certain process so that if you do find yourself caving under pressure, how do you bounce back into the positive state of mind quicker
PHYSICAL SPECIMENS
Evolution; great mental preparation; legacy. These are all fine things, but there is another piece of the puzzle: raw talent.
We get the best athletes in the country, Boyd says of the monopoly rugby has over every other sport in New Zealand.
However, Boyd explains that the game has moved on from the 1960s and 70s, when you could throw a ball and it would hit a farmer. The dawn of strength and conditioning means that the city slickers can match-up physically. And all of them need the skills.
Ahead of his move to Northampton, Boyd is keen to see if England has an outdoor culture for its youth like New Zealand has. He sees one of his countrys greatest assets being the cross-pollination of sports. He gives the example of a teenager the Hurricanes have just signed who is a great at water polo, running hurdles and rugby. No one was shocked when, lo and behold, he turned out to be a good golfer too. Is there an inherent skills gap between rival nations Perhaps, but as Kaino explains, athletes must constantly evolve anyway. Setting win percentages and skills aside, though, there is one last element that Kiwis are particularly proud of.
Boyd leaves us with an anecdote.
The coach heard former England football boss Roy Hodgson speak at a leadership conference about managing a team. After putting his hand up to intercede, Boyd remembers seeing genuine shock from Hodgson when he was informed that truly every Kiwi at the elite level had the teams best interests at heart, over any individual goals. Team first is part of the national psyche, Boyd insists. - CNN

Governments far-sighted plans will regain countrys lost prestige
We must get rid of the bad name the former regime had earned internationally with far-sighted plans, SLFP National Organiser and Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
He was addressing the SLFP Kekirawa Board of Authority meeting organised by Kekirawa SLFP Organiser Rohan Jayakody. The Minister said Rajapaksa nepotism would not do any good to the country but destruction and international disrepute to the nation.
Our country did not need another Hitler, who supported thuggery corruption, robbing and wasting of national assets, he said.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena knows about the needs of the people and does not allow his kith and kin to interfere in government policies.
Today the group of 16 are disappointed and desperate. The SLFP is reviving its glory and prestige, he said.
During the past three and half years, we attempted to settle the colossal debts taken by the Rajapaksa regime. The former president held the presidential elections two years in advance. Astrologer Sumanadasa cannot be blamed for the Rajapaksas defeat. Rajapaksa strategies did not work amidst the arising of Maithripala Sirisena as the common candidate at the election, he said.
The government is now effectively settling the debts. The Gam Peraliya development programme will lessen the burdens of the people, he said.

Politicians behind Aluthgama incident
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said that the 2014 Aluthgama incident was incited by politicians to achieve their narrow and petty political objectives.
The seeds of communalism was sown by the politicians with an objective of securing more votes for them without giving an iota of thought about the countrys future, he said
The Minister stressed that time has come to end political campaigns based on the lines of nationality, religion or caste.
He was speaking at a ceremony to grant compensation to those whose houses and business places were damaged due to incidents that took place in Dharga town and Aluthgama in 2014.
Rs.188 million was distributed among 122 victims at a ceremony held at Atluthgama under Minister Senaratnes patronage. Minister Senaratne said that Rs.250 million was paid to victims of the Aluthgama incident as compensation earlier.

SL people have spent Rs. 200 MN  on antibiotics last year
Antibiotics to the value of Rs. 200 million were sold in Sri Lanka last year, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing the gathering after launching the Primary Healthcare Strengthening Project at BMICH in Colombo recently. Minister Senaratne said 46 agreements were signed to produce drugs in Sri Lanka. Patients can now buy high quality drugs at low prices since the prices of 48 drugs were reduced. More drugs could be purchased at low rate soon and expensive drugs for cancer are among them, he said.
The five-year project launched assisted by the World Bank facilitates every 20,000 people with a health centre, the Minister said.
All citizens will be screened for Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and other health issues. They will be categorised by the level of risk they have to get NCDs. They will be provided a personal health record.
They could obtain treatment from any hospital in the country by presenting the record, the Minister said.

So much love: Ozil thanks Arsenal  fans after Germany racism row
Singapore, Friday: Mesut Ozil thanked Arsenal fans for their love at a pre-season friendly after a torrid week following his racism allegations against Germanys football body.
Ozil watched Arsenals penalties defeat to Atletico Madrid on Thursday from the bench but he received one of the biggest cheers of the night when his image was flashed up on the big screen.
Thanks to the Gunners in Singapore for showing so much love tonight, the 29-year-old German midfielder tweeted, with a picture of him waving to the crowd.
Arsenal fans dominated the audience of 23,000 who watched the London team go down 3-1 on penalties to Atletico in the International Champions Cup, after normal time ended at 1-1.
Ozil, benched after his late return to training following the World Cup, sent shockwaves through German football when he quit the national team, complaining of racism and disrespect.
German football chief Reinhard Grindel rejected the racism charge but admitted he should have defended Ozil after the playmaker was abused for having a photograph taken with Turkeys strongman president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Ozil, who was born in Germany to Turkish-origin parents and lifted the World Cup in 2014, also felt he was unfairly singled out for their shock group-stage exit at this years tournament.
Arsenals new head coach, Unai Emery, and players have rallied round Ozil on their pre-season tour, while the hashtags #StandWithOzil and #SayNoToRacism have been popular on social media.
Of course everybody supports Mesut. Were with him, were trying to help him, Arsenal midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan told AFP this week. Everyone knows that Arsenal is a team with a lot of foreign players and foreign employees. It doesnt matter which country you represent, its like family and we support each other. AFP

Teaching official  languages will half resolve national issue
The national issue could be resolved 50 per cent by teaching Sinhala and Tamil to students, National Integration, Reconciliation and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan yesterday said.
He was addressing the gathering at the ceremony presided by President Maithripala Sirisena at the Sugathadasa Indoor stadium. The ceremony was held to appreciate the students who achieved distinction passes for Sinhala and Tamil from the "If you know, teach, if you do not know, learn" radio programme 2017 organised by the National Integration, Reconciliation and Official Languages Ministry.
He said the attempts taken by the Good Governance Government to make the students learn the official languages was fruitful.
"Last year, 12,753 students had followed the language teaching programmes and this year, over 15.000 students are learning the programmes," he said.
Minister Ganesan said Sri Lanka does not have a national problem. "I was given an opportunity by the President and the Prime Minister to resolve the issue," he said.
He said the Constitution must be changed to address the national issue.
The Minister said 7,565 students followed the learning programme in 2016 and 3,575 students were lauded at the ceremony for their grand achievements at the examination.
He said many students would follow the programme next year and the ceremony to appreciate their achievements would have to be held at the Gall Face green.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, National Integration, Reconciliation and Official Languages Deputy Minister Seyed Ali Sahir Mowlana and Minister Arjuna Ranatunga were present.

Australia coach Justin Langer handed  sweeping  selection powers
New Australian cricket coach Justin Langer has been handed sweeping powers in a shake-up of the selection panel.
Langer will join Greg Chappell and Trevor Hohns on the full-time selection panel with Mark Waugh, who resigned in May, not being replaced.
Langer will also chair Australias Twenty20 selection panel in changes Cricket Australias general manager of team performance Pat Howard says will deliver the best results across all formats.
Previously, Waughs selection role focused specifically on T20 cricket, leading a two-man selection panel with former Australia coach Darren Lehmann.
The Test and ODI selection panel remain the same format, with Hohns as chairman.
Having a selector focus on the T20 format for the past 18 months was viewed as a success, particularly as we now sit third in ICC rankings in this format, and we will look to continue this in a slightly modified way, Howard said.
This sees Justin take on additional responsibility as both the head coach and lead selector in Twenty20 cricket as we build towards the World T20 in Australia in 2020.
Justin has performed a similar role previously while coach of the Perth Scorchers and has a wealth of knowledge around the Big Bash League and its players.
BBL coaches will be involved in the T20 selection process.
Australia face Pakistan in their next T20I outing  a three-match series against the world No 1 20 over side in October.

Australia deports Lankan asylum  seeker despite fathers murder
An asylum seeker has been deported to Sri Lanka despite a last-minute plea to re-examine his case, after his father was shot dead and his mother and sister disappeared earlier this year.
The 25-year-old asylum seeker, known as Kavi, had been detained in the Yongah Hill immigration detention centre near Perth for four months, since his bridging visa expired.
He had been in Australia for six years, having fled Sri Lanka after the 26-year civil war in which his brother was killed in 2009.
Kavis full name is being withheld to protect him from potential danger in Sri Lanka.
In a statement addressed to the Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton, Kavi wrote: On 5 January 2018, I received a very distressing call from my mother.
My mother and sister were crying on the phone and she said my father had been shot dead on the farm. Up to now, no death certificate has been issued by the Sri Lankan authorities.
I have now lost contact with my mother and sister. The last I spoke to them was on 28 March 2018. The Red Cross has been contacted to search for them. Until today I have no news about my mother and sister who are still missing.
The Red Cross confirmed it had received the tracing request but had failed to find Kavis mother and sister.
The changes to Kavis family circumstances were detailed in a letter to Dutton on 27 June as part of an application asking him to allow Kavi to lodge a protection visa application.
I fear that my fathers killing and my mothers and sisters disappearance are connected, he wrote. My family and I believe that my father was killed by the Sri Lankan security agencies. We believe he was killed because they suspected that we assisted the (now-defeated separatist military force, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) LTTE.
Kavi has always maintained that the Sri Lankan security agencies suspected his family, fishermen from the northwest of Sri Lanka, of having supported the LTTE, commonly known as the Tamil Tigers.
I fear of what will happen to me if I am forcefully returned to Sri Lanka, he wrote. I fear that my mother and sister have now been killed and I am afraid that I may face the same fate as my family.
For safety of my life I desperately request that my case is reassessed by the Department of Home Affairs.
Before appealing to Dutton, Kavi had been rejected four times as a refugee by Australian authorities. Having been found not to meet the criteria for refugee status by the then immigration department, he had applied for review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and two appeals were dismissed.
Under the Migration Act, the minister has broad powers to allow someone who has had a visa refused to reapply.
Dutton did not allow Kavi to do so, despite the murder and disappearance of his family members.
Home affairs department regulations state that requests will be considered where a person makes genuine and compelling claims that could not have been made in their initial application.But the department also states that the minister will not consider claims from someone who does not hold a current visa.
Kavis bridging visa was cancelled before his mother and sister disappeared.
The Australian government maintains it never sends people back to a place of potential harm, but that people with no lawful basis to remain in Australia are expected to return home. Australia does not remove people to Sri Lanka who engage Australias non-refoulement obligations. Australia takes its non-refoulement obligations seriously, it said.
It is understood Kavi was deported early on 17 May.
He has said he intends to escape to India, where Sri Lankan refugees live in rural inland camps or undocumented in the margins of cities in Tamil Nadu.
I cant do anything now, he has told friends in Australia. Im going to India. I will be safe there.

Cambodian  PM hails  'elimination' of opposition
CAMBODIA: Cambodia's strongman Hun Sen on Friday hailed his success in eliminating traitors ahead of an election he cannot possibly lose, with no credible opposition left to challenge his 33-year rule of what has become a virtual one-party state.
Hun Sen addressed a huge crowd on the final day of campaigning ahead of Sunday's vote, which promises to be an easy victory for the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) despite calls for a boycott that Hun Sen decried.
Tens of thousands of supporters decked in the ruling party's white and blue arrived from dawn in the centre of the capital, some on motorbikes and buses, in an impressive show of support. But it will be the only political showing of significant scale ahead of the election after the sole serious opposition was dissolved by the Supreme Court in November.
In typically bombastic style, Hun Sen vowed victory on Sunday and took a swipe at his opponents, many of whom have been jailed, prodded into self-exile or gone to ground inside the kingdom since the ruling. Recently we took legal action to eliminate traitors who attempted to topple the government, he said of the court ruling that disbanded the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP).
If we didn't eliminate them with an iron fist, maybe by now Cambodia would be in a situation of war. A pillar of Hun Sen's appeal is that he has presided over peace and a level of prosperity since the early 1990s when Cambodia emerged from decades of war and the trauma of the Khmer Rouge regime which killed one quarter of the population from 1975-79.
His party has won every election since 1998 while Hun Sen, 65, has maintained control through a tight patronage network and family alliances.
With the CPP we have growth, we have schools, peace... everything, said supporter Khun Bopha of a party that now presides over an economy chugging along at a growth rate of around six to seven percent. We will have a big win on July 29. The Supreme Court knocked out the opposition after Hun Sen accused CNRP members of plotting against the government. But the crackdown took place after the CNRP performed well in local elections last year, building on the 55 seats they won in parliament in the national poll in 2013.
Rights groups, NGOs and the media were all swept up in the wide-ranging push as Hun Sen quashed critical voices and challengers. The opposition, many of whose key members fled the country, have urged supporters to boycott the poll in a clean finger campaign to refuse to be inked at polling stations.
Election authorities have said calls to boycott are a crime and have already fined five former members of the opposition in northern Cambodia after accusing them of endorsing the anti-election campaign. Hun Sen also warned against the attempt in his speech. Those against the election are the ones who destroy the nation and democracy and should not be forgiven, he said.
The United States and the European Union have pulled assistance and monitors but staunch Cambodia ally China has stepped in to provide equipment. Cambodia has held six elections -- including the first UN-sponsored poll in 1993 -- after the country of 15 million emerged from decades of civil war.

Cover-up: Jakarta hides foul river  with giant net before Asian Games
The Jakarta city government has come under fire for buying a giant nylon net to cover up a polluted and foul-smelling river weeks before the Indonesian capital hosts the 2018 Asian Games.
The Sentiong River, which twists alongside the athletes village in Kemayoran in central Jakarta, is so polluted it is known by locals as kali itemor the black river.
The administration installed a 600 by 20 metre black mesh net earlier in July to minimise the putrid stench and unsightly view.
An official from the Jakarta water resources agency said the nets were intended to hide the aquatic eyesore.
Its function is to elevate the beauty [of the river] so that the black water cannot be directly seen by international athletes, the official, Supriyono, told Kompas.
The cost of the river beautification plan is just over 580m rupiah (30,000), Jakartas deputy governor, Sandiaga Uno, told reporters at city hall on Tuesday.
The move has been criticised and ridiculed, with some saying the city government was more interested in covering up the river than in trying to clean it.
Jakartas governor, Anies Baswedan, has argued that his administration inherited the chronic problem.
If the past administrations took notice of this issue, we would not have inherited the black river, he told Tempo. But now it has grabbed widespread attention.
The governor said on a visit to the area that the river had to be covered up because it ran past the athletes dining hall.
He also said the government was working to clean the waterway by employing aerators and nano bubble technology to help break down organic material.
Water from a dam in Bogor in west Java is being pumped in to help flush the river out, and the city government said it planned to build more wastewater treatment plants.
Wastewater from houses and a nearby tofu factory have contributed to the heavily polluted condition of the Sentiong, one of many rivers in that run through Jakarta.
The national development and planning board reported in February that 96% of river water in the Indonesian capital was severely polluted.
The Asian Games begin on 18 August, with 11,000 athletes from 45 countries expected to attend the largest multi-sporting event after the Olympics.
Events will be hosted in Jakarta and Palembang in south Sumatra.  theguardian

Cricketer turned politician  Imran Khan declares victory,  but his win could thrust Pakistan into turmoil
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan: Imran Khan, a onetime international cricket star and tabloid playboy who reinvented himself as a crusading anti-establishment politician, declared victory Thursday for his party in parliamentary elections, even as his rivals charged that the polls had been rigged and the official results remained unclear.
In a statesmanlike address, Khan set out a grand vision for a new government that would end corruption in high places, protect the weak and ensure equal rights for all. But the taint of a questionable victory, and the contentious aftermath of an election that toppled the ruling party, seemed more likely to usher in a period of political turmoil than a smooth transition.
Pakistan, a nuclear-armed state and a longtime security ally of the United States, has a history of elected leaders being overthrown by the military or pushed out by other institutions such as the courts.
Until 2008, no elected head of state had finished a full term. Wednesdays election has been seen as a critical test of the democratic institutions in a country with a strong, influential military.
Cricket hero Imran Khan with the World Cup in 1992.
Although security officials vowed to remain neutral, the military was accused of interfering in the election on Khans behalf, including reports that some promising candidates from the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-N were covertly induced to leave the party. On election day, opponents from several major parties alleged fraud at the polls.
Khan has often publicly praised the military but has denied any collusion. Some critics, especially the family of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, have called the election a soft coup.
Even if unproven, the association could harm Khans relations with other parties as he tries to form a coalition government or rule on his own.
In his speech Thursday, Khan tried to placate the election critics, offering to help probe any wrongdoing at the polls.
I feel this election has been the fairest in Pakistans history, he said, and still if any party has any doubt, we will open up the result of those constituencies for investigation.
Khan also briefly described his foreign policy plans, saying he wanted to have mutually beneficial relations with the United States.
In the past, he has strongly condemned the U.S. deployment of drones to kill suspected Taliban extremists in the border areas of Pakistan.
Imran Khan, a former Pakistani cricket star turned politician, declared July 26 his partys victory in the elections, which he praised as transparent.
Both Khans acolytes and his adversaries acknowledged that his sudden ascent as the dominant force in Pakistani politics could potentially bring enormous change to a country where power has long resided in a feudal elite and its military allies.
Yet some analysts pointed out that Khans ambitious agenda  massive job creation, economic reforms  could easily become sidetracked by such intractable problems as high illiteracy and birthrates, violent religious extremism, a fast-falling currency and dangerous shortages of water and power in the impoverished Muslim-majority nation of nearly 208 million.
Although this is a dream that has devoured him for two decades, he may well find it a poisoned chalice, columnist Irfan Husain wrote in Dawn newspaper.
Above all, Khan seems to be counting on his personal charisma and passion  qualities that once wowed cricket fans and made him a magnet for women, then drove him to succeed in politics and energized his winning campaign  to carry over into the messy business of governing.
Although still Mick Jagger-lean and craggily handsome in his mid-60s, Khan bears little resemblance to the sports celebrity who burned up the London tabloids in the 1990s with his hard-partying exploits and storybook marriage to Jemima Goldsmith, a beautiful British socialite. (Divorced with two children, the two are still close, and she tweeted him congratulations on his election win.)
These days, he has been cultivating his image as a pious Muslim, often wearing a traditional tunic and pajamas, fingering prayer beads and huddling with religious party leaders. In February, as the campaign was getting underway, he married a woman named Bushra Maneka, whom he described as his spiritual adviser, then published photos of their nuptial ceremony with her face and body fully hidden beneath scarves.
Soon after that, though, Reham Khan, another woman Khan had married briefly in 2015 and divorced, was reported to be writing a tell-all book about his scandalous personal behavior.
She told the Times newspaper that the book was not ready to be published but that issues such as sexual harassment, sexual perversion, sexual favors are in the public interest when they are connected to someones ability to govern. For two decades, Khan has waged a one-man crusade against the Pakistani establishment. He started out giving anti-corruption speeches on sidewalks, then began staging mass rallies that were more like festivals.
He ran for Parliament in 2013, winning 13 percent of the vote and building an enthusiastic young following. He challenged then-Prime Minister Sharif in court, accusing him of hiding wealth abroad, in a case that led Sharif to be barred from political office and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
This year, Khan again challenged the Sharif dynasty at the polls, running for an unprecedented five seats in Parliament from districts across the country.
He won them all, even defeating former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, a former top aide to Sharif, by a 2-to-1 margin.
He has played down his own considerable wealth and often draws attention to a cancer hospital he built in Lahore, Pakistan, through his private charity.
In his victory speech from his sprawling home above the capital, Khan spoke and acted like a self-confident leader, in full command and ready to rule, with a detailed list of plans, policies and promises to raise Pakistans struggling masses and end the corrupt ways of an entrenched elite.
He pledged to create a government and an Islamic welfare state that would fulfill the unrealized democratic dream of Pakistans founder, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, and he vowed to set an example by living humbly and eschewing the luxuries of political power.
He laid out a range of proposed reforms, including better public education and tax collection.
Yet the election was not over, and the shocks continued Thursday as more results were reported throughout the day, with numerous veteran politicians losing seats they had held for years.
People in scattered communities were still mourning more than 225 victims of multiple suicide bombings in the past month, several at campaign rallies and one on election day.
And Khan, whose party needs to win 141 seats to form its own government and guarantee he becomes prime minister, is more likely going to have to navigate the complex waters of compromising and dealmaking with his erstwhile election rivals  possibly even some of those whom the spellbinding orator insulted as donkeys in an unguarded moment on the campaign trail.

Cristiano Ronaldo fined  3.2 million euro in tax evasion case
MADRID, Friday - Cristiano Ronaldo will be fined 3.2 million euros (2.82 million pounds)and sentenced to 24 months in prison, a sentence he is unlikely to serve, after settling a tax evasion case with Spanish tax authorities, the prosecutor said on Friday.
The 33-year-old is accused of evading 5.7 million euros in taxes. He has denied the allegations.
Ronaldo is unlikely to go to prison as Spanish law states a sentence of under two years for a first offence can be served on probation. The football star will be required to pay the 3.2-million-euro fine plus the 5.7 million euros in back taxes, 1 million euros in accrued interest
and 250 euros-per-day for the 48 months covering the prison sentence. This amount is likely to be only part of the strikers fines over the case, which are expected to rise to around 19 million euros in total.

Defending champions India will face arch-rivals Pakistan on September 19, the day after Team India open their Asia Cup 2018 campaign against a yet-to-be-confirmed qualifier on September 18. Slamming the poor scheduling, former India cricketer Virender Sehwag said India should not play the tournament. Sehwag also said a player needs a minimum of 24-48 hours rest after playing an ODI match.
I am really shocked to see the scheduling because which country plays back-to-back cricket matches these days There was a gap of two days in between the T20 matches in England and here you are playing ODIs under hot Dubai weather and that too without a break. So, I dont think this is a correct scheduling, Sehwag said.
A furious Sehwag said if there was a problem with the scheduling then India shouldnt have played the Asia Cup.
Why theres such hue and cry over playing the Asia Cup Dont play the Asia Cup. Prepare the team for the home series or the away series. Its really difficult to play back-to-back games, Sehwag told IndiaTV.
India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan are all confirmed participants, with the remaining spot still up for grabs amongst hosts United Arab Emirates (UAE), Singapore, Oman, Nepal, Malaysia and Hong Kong.
Group A consists of India, Pakistan and the qualifier while Group B comprises of Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The top two teams from each group will qualify for the Super 4 and two teams will then play the final on September 28.
Sehwag said the BCCI should have acted on it rather than reducing Indias ongoing four-day tour game against Essex ahead of the five-match Test series against England.
There shouldnt be any back-to-back games. If the BCCI had to cancel anything then it should have been the qualifier game in the Asia Cup rather than reducing the four-day practice match against Essex to three days. A player needs at least 48 hours to recover after playing an ODI match because you field for 3.5 hours and after that if you bat for 2 hours then it makes your total time spend on the ground to 5.5 hours. So, it takes a minimum of 24 to 48 hours for a player to recover, he added.
Sehwag, who played 251 ODIs and 104 Tests for India, said playing back-to-back games will definitely take a toll on the Indian players.
He also said the poor scheduling will give Pakistan an advantage against India.
When Team India will play the Asia Cup in Dubai in September, there will be too much heat and it will hamper the players recovery process. Pakistan will be in a good shape whereas the Indian players will be tired. And if we end up losing the match, then there might be a problem as we all are very passionate whenever we play against Pakistan. We always want India to win against Pakistan but if the Indian players are tired then Pakistan will definitely have the advantage, he said.  NDTV

ECHOES OF BLACK JULY IN TASKS OF CLEAN GOVERNMENT
This week saw the 35th anniversary of the anti-Tamil pogrom of July 1983, which was the darkest phase in post-independent Sri Lanka. It saw to rise of separatist forces, joining or being forced to give room to the LTTE. It also gave emphasis to racism in the politics of government, as the country moved through three decades of separatist violence, which ended with the defeat of the LTTE in 1990.
As one who lived through those dark days, the role of the government in instigating and promoting the violence of the initial three days can never be forgotten. The Police did not respond to calls to bring about order. There was no curfew in place to curb the violence. Many Sinhalese and Muslims did act on their own, and at much personal risk to help the Tamils, whom they could; but the larger number of Tamils, especially in urban areas lost life and property, and had to be sheltered in refugee centres.
The tragedies of that time, and the cooperation among communities that rose above the background of manipulated violence, where the governing forces had a major role to play, apart from personal reminiscences, remain the topic of many books, theatrical and cinematic works that put down this record in history.
Thirty-five years later, the battles are over and we are at peace, but is it a situation that can ensure the prevention of such tragedies in the future How far have we moved in the path to reconciliation, which is fast becoming a word of near contempt among those who believe in the rule of the majority We have failed to bring about a new constitution needed to ensure the plurality of people, in a unitary state. How far have we moved to bring about the deeper aspects of devolution that is necessary for the pluralism of a multi-ethnic state Are we not moving to, or have we not moved to a Sinhala Buddhist State, which is far from the pluralism and multi-ethnicity that could ensure peace in the future
It was clearly the darkest phase of a democratically elected government, having a huge parliamentary majority, using the backroom of violence to bring about an enormous tragedy that served its narrow political purposes of domineering governance. It saw President JR Jayewardene, who remained silent for several days, come out and tell the Sinhalese to look after their own protection.
There was hardly any sympathy for the Tamils who suffered in the manipulated tragedy. This attitude of the government saw the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, which led to the main Opposition  TULF - leave parliament, and a legislative assembly that have no elected members of the principal ethnic minority in the country. It gave strength to the Tamil separatist forces, with dominance and control by the LTTE, and three decades of civil war, with those multiplying records of violence and tragedy, until the final defeat of the LTTE, under the political leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa, and the total commitment of the Armed Forces.
Thirty-five years later, the battles are over and we are at peace, but is it a situation that can ensure the prevention of such tragedies in the future How far have we moved in the path to reconciliation, which is fast becoming a word of near contempt among those who believe in the rule of the majority We have failed to bring about a new constitution needed to ensure the plurality of people, in a unitary state. How far have we moved to bring about the deeper aspects of devolution that is necessary for the pluralism of a multi-ethnic state Are we not moving to, or have we not moved to a Sinhala Buddhist State, which is far from the pluralism and multi-ethnicity that could ensure peace in the future
In this anniversary period of Black July, these are issues to be considered by the current government, elected on a pledge of peace and reconciliation. It should see the need for politics of national unity that makes efforts to move away from the politics of division, the prevailing reality. The politics of division that cannot fight corruption and bring about unity of purpose, for better education, embracing new technology, and moving to the demands of the Digital Age. These are challenges for the governments of today and tomorrow.
A coliseum of corruption
The past week saw a major display of the spread of corruption that affects both the Opposition and the government. The Adjournment Debate in Parliament on the alleged Chinese funding for the election of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was adjourned for want of a quorum. The members of the Rajapaksa family who are MPs were missing  Mahinda, brother Chamal, and son Namal. Mahinda was far away in Singapore. The Joint Opposition gave every indication it did not like the debate. They do not like the related reporting of the New York Times. They had to answer allegations on facts that are clearly available to the Government, as the NYT reported.
The quorum in parliament is 20 members. Members of the Government called for this debate. It was the Governments duty to ensure a debate. What was seen in parliament was an attempt by both the Government and Opposition to avoid this debate, raising many questions about the reach and depth of this corruption. It fact, it was the duty of the Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, to have made a clear statement to the House on these transactions, from the time the NYT story broke out. It is evident there was a Central Bank or Government probe into these payments, from early 2015, when the story was first reported in the Daily News.
The absence of such a clear statement by Government on these payments, gives the impression that it is not eager to carry out this exposure. Is it because the money is from a Chinese State-owned company, with important links to the government today Alternatively, could this search for silence be, because such funds may have come to UNP or any other government members or ministers, too
There was a time when President Sirisena was busy threatening to use a madu valigey to attack the corrupt. Later this moved to threats of the Presidential Sword to strike at the corrupt. Have these weapons gone to the presidential sheath Does the government not understand that the corruption it accused the Rajapaksa Regime of, has moved with speed to its own ranks  as the Perpetual payments clearly showed
The NYT report is only one aspect of the corruption of the Rajapaksas. This government was elected on a pledge to fight the corruption of the past regime. What is seen today is both administrative, legal, judicial and political moves to prevent this exposure of the corrupt. The headlines of the first year of Good Government, has now moved to headlines of procrastination, inaction or avoidance of action. This in turn gives many opportunities for the Rajapaksa forces to claim near sainthood in governance, and blame this government to false allegations against them.
In a country that is moving to the strongest phase of family politics, this continued failure to fight corruption goes far beyond the politics of fellow back scratching. It moves to the strengthening of the forces of corruption, in every political colour, and moves to the Hitlerite expectations of many for a rise in the politics of fascism, with a slogan against corruption to serve ones own political ends. It brings to mind JRJs invitation to the robbers.
As the choice of candidates for the next presidency moves closer, the signs are that the coming contest will not be one of fighting corruption. It is more likely to be a contest between the corrupt, with the more corrupt forces getting closer to the winning post.
That Paisley Farce
The SLPPs Lotus bud chair, Prof. G. L. Peiris, has defended the many millions paid by the Rajapaksa regime to host UK MP Ian Paisley Jr here to give him a real picture of the post-war situation in the country, and work against the UK governments move to support the UNHRC resolution against Sri Lanka.
Those costly efforts certainly paid no dividends, as seen how the Tory Government of David Cameron, ignored whatever explanation Paisley gave, and decided to support the UNHRC resolution. We can call that a selection of the wrong messenger for the purpose, or the lager failure of Sri Lankan foreign policy, of which he GLP was minister, of course Monitored by Sajin Vaas Gunewardena.
What is of bigger interest is why this man had to be brought down with his wife and children on both occasions, to make this study of conditions here If there was anything professional about him, could he not have come alone, and moved around in this country and done a good study for a report worth the money spent What has happened is a farce. The MP brought down was not from the Tory or Labour parties. He is from the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party. It is only now, with Theresa Mays parliamentary majority crisis, that it may have some voice to move a prime minister.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka and the Government here have certainly acted in a most foolish manner in this exercise of waste. It does not get any justification from a professorial explanation, neither of the law not of politics.

Galgamuwa  Hospital ails
The Galgamuwa Base Hospital lacks enough doctors and the people seeking treatment from the hospital lament they have to wait in queues for hours to consult a doctor.
Around 40 medical officers were recruited to the hospital in 2013 and of them, only 20 are available now.
The hospital was revamped with modern facilities including two Emergency Treatment Units (ETUs) and a blood bank recently.
Many of them were now closed without doctors.
About 600 patients come to its OPD daily, but it cannot provide them with medicines without doctors.
North Western Province Health Director Dr. Fareed said the issue will be resolved soon.

Bribery Commission to broaden scope
GRAFT in private sector  to be criminalised
The new Bribery Commission Act being formulated will criminalise bribery in the private sector and bribery of foreign public officials, Commissions Director General Sarath Jayamanne PC said.
The DG was addressing a press conference to wind up the three-day Global Expert Group Meeting on the Jakarta Principles in Colombo, yesterday.
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Chief of the Corruption and Economic Crime Section Candice Welsch said deliberations of the meeting will lead to the Colombo Commentary and it will be a guideline to all 186 countries which are signatory to the UN Convention Against Corruption.
DG Jayamanne expressed confidence that legal reforms including the new Bribery Act and Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law, which were not revised for more than 25 years, would be completed before the end of this year. Amendments to those laws are coming at a high speed, he said.
He said the new anti-graft law will include the private sector and foreign public officials significantly, broadening its scope. A Foreign public official means any person holding a legislative, administrative or judicial office of a foreign country, whether appointed or elected (including a local public entity in a foreign country).
According to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention the offence of bribery of foreign public officials is committed when any person intentionally offers, promises or gives any undue pecuniary or other advantage to a foreign public official in order to obtain or retain business or other improper advantage in the conduct of international business.
The DG said the new Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) Act being drafted has also proposed provisions to enhance its institutional independence. We want monitoring autonomy and our funds have to come from Parliament. We need the independence to recruit our own experts such as experts in accountancy, engineering, banking and bond transactions. he added.
Jayamanne PC identified that the lack of human resources, low wages to its staff and lack of building space as challenges to the Commission. He said the new CIABOC Act will also include provisions to improve public sector integrity by strengthening the bribery and corruption prevention mechanism in them. In many other countries the system is such that the Head of the Institution is responsible in implementing a mechanism to prevent bribery and corruption. We need a similar mechanism here, he said.
He said that an overall attitudinal change of the public and education are vital in combating bribery and corruption which are deep rooted in the country.

If you havent prepared for life after  sports youre in serious trouble - Smith
Robin Smith was arguably the most dynamic and exciting member of a fragile England top order of the early and mid-1990s.
In 62 Tests, the right-hander scored more than 4,000 runs at an average of 43.67, among the highest of any contemporary England player. But South Africa-born Smiths rise as a swashbuckling, stroke-making number five was perhaps as rapid as his fall from the international stage.
Now living in Australia, the 54-year-old former Hampshire captain has faced new battles off the pitch. When the bubble bursts as a professional sportsman, if you havent prepared for life after, youre in serious trouble, he told BBC Radio Solent.
One of the hardest things is accepting your time has come; to end your professional career.
FINGERS IN TOO MANY PIES
Mental problems and anxiety forced Smith into a more reclusive life since retiring in 2003. Now he is channelling his experiences into a degree in psychological science at Swinburne University, Melbourne.
When we were playing, we werent encouraged to pursue thoughts or careers outside the game, he said. I was criticised by [then England coach and chairman of selectors] Keith Fletcher and Ray Illingworth for having too many fingers in too many pies.
Its different now with the work the Professional Cricketers Association do, but it was very difficult then.
I would love to become a psychologist once Ive qualified in about three-and-a-half years.
Its such a deep process trying to get over professional sport.
People also have mental issues if theyve been involved in a company for 20 years and they probably feel exactly the same thing.
Smith approached the England selectors in the early 1990s about having a sports psychologist in the squad, but his suggestion was declined. There were a lot of England players who I believe wouldve become better had there been a psychologist within our midst, he said. You just have to look back at Mike Brearley as an England captain, who was just fantastic. Mike wasnt even close to being in the best XI in England, but he rallied the troops and brought out their best performances.
If you speak to Ian Botham, had it not been for Mike, he just wouldnt have been the player he was.
TRIALS AGAINST SPIN
Despite Smiths eye-catching ability at Test level to dispatch some of the most fearsomely quick bowlers with a flourishing cut or pull shot, it was his struggles against spin that finally led to him being dropped by England in 1996.Shane Warne, later a Hampshire team-mate, was among his chief tormentors. I started losing my confidence because I started listening and believing the press and what they had to say about my inadequacies against spin bowling, Smith said.
With my personality and the way I am in my character, I can lose confidence exceptionally quickly. Thats when I started to deteriorate against high-quality spin. I wasnt really exposed to it growing up in South Africa, which is why I was very good against pace. Maybe I should have opened the batting, who knows
On song, Smiths most destructive innings against pace included an unbeaten 167 off 163 balls against Australia at Edgbaston in an ODI in 1993.
That knock stood as the highest individual score by an England batsman in limited-overs cricket until Alex Hales surpassed it with 171 against Pakistan in 2016.
I phoned Alex to congratulate him, it was a wonderful innings, said Smith, whose elder brother Chris also played Test cricket for England. I was surprised it took 23 years to break the record due to the way they play these days. They play one-day cricket with such immense freedom and the shots they play are just stunning. There are shots I couldnt have played myself.

## Title: Imran Khan:  A new innings
## Supertitle:

Imran Khan:  A new innings
Imran Khan is a legend in the cricketing world, with nearly 10,000 runs and 550 wickets to his name in an international career that spanned from 1971 to 1992. The highlight of his career was Pakistans emergence as World Champions at the Cricket World Cup in Australia in 1992 under his dynamic leadership. The charismatic and flamboyant Khan, 65, is facing a different ball game altogether as the incoming Prime Minister of Pakistan. If leading 11 players on the field was difficult enough, steering a country of 200 million on the international political and diplomatic turf will be a thousand times more challenging.
Stability and peace are two ingredients that Pakistan badly needs after non-stop turmoil. In fact, none of the 18 Prime Ministers of Post-Independent Pakistan completed their full five year term. This is only the second time in Pakistani history that a civilian Government is handing over the reins to another. In between, the military has interjected itself to the ruling apparatus much of the time. The military is an all-powerful entity in Pakistan, though most observers say that Khan has a good relationship with the Generals which may help him carry forward his vision for Pakistan.
Ending violence and terrorism should be a priority for Khan. The recent election campaign was among the most violent in living memory, thanks to a spate of suicide bombings blamed on the ISIS and other terror groups. While some detractors say that Khan has been soft on militancy, such sentiments will be disastrous in the ruling seat. Khan must be firm on eliminating terrorism from Pakistani soil. If his PTI (Pakistani Movement for Justice) partys excellent track record on fighting terrorism in the volatile Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province is anything to go by, there is nothing to fear on this count.
It will also be interesting to see how he performs on the diplomatic stage. Many Indian politicians and sports figures, most of whom he personally knows, have already congratulated him. Improving ties with India should be a priority for Khan, who has shown a willingness to be somewhat flexible over the vexed Kashmir issue. Kashmir is the core issue between India and Pakistan and the two countries should resolve it through dialogue, he said recently, raising hopes of making some headway on this matter which has adversely affected regional security as well. As a former cricketer himself, he may also want to resume bilateral cricket series with India and get more international cricket for Pakistan on home soil.
The world will also watch how he manages ties with the U.S., which had its ups and downs in recent times, especially over the issues of terrorism and Afghanistan. Khan has pledged to support the U.S. in fighting terrorists but has opposed U.S.-backed operations by the Pakistani military. All SAARC countries including India will be looking forward to having better ties with Pakistan. Sri Lanka and Pakistan have always been good friends and things can only get better under Khan, who is no stranger to Sri Lankans.
Domestically, Khan has many problems to solve. Corruption has always been a cancer that has crippled Pakistan  for example, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, a bitter opponent of Khan, is serving a 10-year jail for illegal overseas property transactions. In fact, a promised anti-corruption drive was one of the main planks of Khans election campaign that appealed to the younger generation that make up 60 percent of the countrys population.
Khan also pledged to improve the US$ 300 billion economy which is in a state of crisis and create more educational opportunities and jobs for the youth. With the economic growth rate hovering around 5 percent till 2020 and only around one percent of the population paying direct taxes, Khan will have an unenviable task on his hands. Khan has proposed a Naya Pakistan economic policy and vision that calls for, among other things, a reduction of the US$ 9.6 billion military budget, reduction in the number of ministries, abolition of the Railways Ministry, income tax on agriculture, job training for two million youth in two years, increase in investment spending, restructuring underperforming State enterprises and tax collection on Rs.900 billion undetected income.
But his biggest challenge will be giving hope to the young people in Pakistan. He has already spoken about increasing the focus on education in a country where more than five million children of school going age are either at home or engaged in menial labour. He wants to double the number of girls attending school and increase spending on education to 5 percent of GDP. He even has a radical plan to stop the funding of schools and get such monies directly to the hands of students.
From now on, Khan will have to bat on an entirely different wicket where so many players are literally out to get his scalp. He cannot afford to put a foot wrong as he guides his chosen team towards the future. If all goes well, his new political innings should be even more interesting than the cricketing one.

India wants change of schedule for  India-Pakistan Asia Cup 2018 match
When the Asia Cup 2018 fixtures were announced, there was a genuine buzz in the air as soon as Indian cricket fans found out about the India-Pakistan game on September 19.
The rivalry between India and Pakistan remains a feisty one, but political tensions between the two countries over the years means clashes between the two sides have been restricted to ICC events only. However, a report in CricketNext indicates that the BCCI is unhappy about having to play against a qualifier just one day before the derby against neighbours Pakistan.
The scheduling is mindless. There appears to be zero application of mind, a senior BCCI official said according to the CricketNext report.
How can you accept a scenario where India plays a game today and tomorrow it will face its arch-rival Pakistan who will have a two-day period of rest
This is unacceptable and has to be revisited. Maybe for the organisers it is just a money-spinning game but for us it is important that there be equity in scheduling, the unnamed official added.
Pakistan will also play a match against a qualifier on September 16, but they will get a two-day break to rest and recuperate for the match against India.
By contrast, India will play against a qualifier on September 18 then take to the field the very next day for what is sure to be a much tougher match and with much higher stakes against Pakistan.

IOC asks UN to approve  sports equipment  shipment to N. Korea
Geneva, Friday: The International Olympic Committee urged the United Nations on Friday to approve an exemption allowing the delivery of sports equipment to North Korea, despite sanctions against the totalitarian regime.
The call from Olympic President Thomas Bach came after the United States blocked a request submitted by the IOC earlier this month to the UN Sanctions Committee.
We hope there can be a positive result in the interest of these athletes, and that such a move can also facilitate the IOC to contribute to the thawing of tensions on the Korean peninsula through sport, Bach said in a statement sent to AFP.
Some experts believe that sports diplomacy between North and South Korea ahead of PyeongChang 2018 -- which led to the two countries forming joint teams at the Games -- paved the way for the subsequent unprecedented political talks between Seoul and Pyongyang.
Bach said he was grateful that the Sanctions Committee granted an exemption during the Games and voiced hope that this can be extended.
But in a letter to committee chair seen by AFP, the US said it objects to any further exemptions to sanctions imposed against North Korea over its missile and nuclear programmes.
North Korea is also banned from importing luxury goods under UN resolutions that may apply to sports equipment.
The IOC said the exemption request was confined to equipment for a very limited number of athletes so that they can prepare to qualify and participate in upcoming Olympic Games.
US Ambassador Nikki Haley has stressed that the Security Council cant do one thing until North Korea takes steps toward scrapping its nuclear and missile programmes.
The IOC said it was not aware if a final decision on its request had been made.

ITC calls Sri Lanka to chase Trade-to-Jobs next
With the recent unveiling of trade related national projects such as NES and SLTIP, there is clear progress in the management of Sri Lankas international trade, Genevas International Trade Centre (ITC) said last week.
Its time to leverage these initiatives to move to the next level, stressed Genevas International Trade Centre (ITC) in Colombo.
There is clear progress in the management of Sri Lankas international trade. We at the International Trade Centre are pleased. The glass is half full for Sri Lankas trade and you need to fill the rest, Geneva International Trade Centre (ITC)s Executive Director Arancha Gonzlez said in Colombo last Friday. Gonzlez was in discussions with Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen on the sidelines of the launch of Sri Lanka Trade information Portal (SLTIP) by the Commerce Department.
Acknowledging ITCs call, Sri Lanka nudged Geneva to support the countrys SMEs so that they could take on a bigger role in the countrys exports.
Minister Bathiudeen thanked ITC for its role in Sri Lankas trade reform initiatives. I thank the ITC for the support extended to the Government to implement the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement.The World Bank and the ITC coordinated their activities in Sri Lankas trade facilitation very well. Continuous collaboration between donors and development partners is key to maximise benefits of technical assistance in Sri Lanka, Minister Bathiudeen said.  I welcome ITC offer to further support our TIP in the coming years.
This complements World Banks efforts and also ensures the sustainability of the large scale trade reforms by our Government. We have a registered SME base of more than one million.When adding the unregistered SME numbers, it translates into an even larger base of economic activity.These SMEs play a considerable role in our domestic consumer, supply and even value chains.As the Minister in charge of our SMEs, I believe that time has come to integrate this sector into our exports and make these brands visible globally.
I call on ITC to extend its support to our ongoing efforts to link SMEs to global chains. Gonzlez praised Sri Lankas trade reform initiatives. There is clear progress in the management of Sri Lankas international trade. We at International Trade Centre are pleased of National Export Strategy and Sri Lanka Trade Information Portal. The glass is half full for Sri Lankas trade, and you need to fill the rest. The NES and SLTIP should now be perationalised well. European Union is very supportive of these initiatives, Gonzlez said.
Sri Lanka should start leveraging this progress, she said.

Justice Ministry to launch  public awareness programme
The level of awareness about the countrys law implementation system will be increased by the Justice Ministry among police officers, grama niladaris, adults committee members and public officers. The Legal Aid Commission will carry out the task, Justice Ministry sources said.
The Legal Aid Commission of Sri Lanka was set up on July 7, 1978 by the Legal Aid Act No. 27 of 1978. Only five legal aid centres function in Colombo, Galle, Anuradhapura, Kurunegala and Kandy. The Colombo Head Office reportedly has 82 legal aid centres.

Lankan badminton star Sriyani wins gold at Las Vegas tourney
DUBAI, Thursday -Former Sri Lanka badminton champion Sriyani Deepika hopes to inspire UAE-based players to aim for glory after winning a gold medal in the Womens Singles Seniors 50+ division at the Las Vegas World Chinese Invitational Badminton Tournament held from July 20-22.
Organized by the World Chinese Badminton Federation - United States Branch under the aegis of USA Badminton, Sriyani displayed great skill and stamina to defeat veteran Chinese players in the singles in addition to bagging a bronze medal in the 50+ Mixed Doubles event partnering a Sri Lankan Anura Krishantha.
It was a dream come true and a result of my hard work and dedication to the sport which I have been playing since the age of 12, said an elated Sriyani shrugging off jet lag on her return to the UAE on Thursday morning. Sriyani showed great reserves of stamina for a 51-year-old mother of two teenaged children, battling tenaciously for more than three hours on court on the first day of the competition which attracted shuttlers from 19 countries. She won all her three round robin matches to emerge champion defeating Lili Cai 31-17, Liz hen Xu 31-13 and Rungrong Zeng 31-30 in the 50+ Womens Singles event. Partnering Krishantha, she overcame the pairing of John Wu and Xia Min Tang 31-28, Yong Li and Huang 31-17 and Andre Kristian and Jen Huang 31-30 in the 50+ Mixed Doubles preliminary round. But she had to be content with a bronze medal in the Mixed Doubles after having lost to the
Chinese pairing of Zhikun Cai/Guang Qin Tian 21-31 in the semi-finals. Silver medallist at the World Masters Games held in New Zealand last year, the Dubai-based Sri Lankan badminton star seems to be at the pinnacle of her career though she won the last of her five national singles titles more than two decades ago.
I never officially retired from the sport keeping myself fit by playing in tournaments when I moved to the UAE in 2011 and also doing coaching, said Sriyani who has been running her own academy Deepika Badminton Academy for the past four years and also participates in the ongoing Dubai Sports World summer camp.
I highly appreciate the encouragement given by the badminton fraternity in the UAE who wished me before every match with messages of support. This was a great source of inspiration for me to achieve success. I hope I could represent UAE in future international competitions, said Deepika who played under the Sri Lanka flag.

Macquarie Group appoints  first female chief executive
The Macquarie Group said on Thursday that Shemara Wikramanayake, head of the investment banks asset management arm, would take over as the groups first female Chief Executive following the retirement of Nicholas Moore in November. The appointment was a significant landmark for women in the global investment banking industry, where the most senior executive roles at the largest banks continue to be dominated by men.
Wikramanayake, a 30-year veteran at Macquarie, was considered by analysts as the frontrunner for the top job at the Australian investment bank, which has transformed its operations over the past decade to expand its annuity-style businesses, which generate recurring income.
Macquaries asset management business is the largest of the investment banks divisions, generating A$1.69bn (US$1.26bn) of its A$2.56bn total net profit in the year to March 31.
It has expanded rapidly since she took the helm in 2008. Ms Wikramanayake said she was in no rush to make major changes at Macquarie, which under Mr. Moores decade-long tenure recovered from a big drop in profits following the 2008 financial crisis to become one of the best performing investment banks over recent years.
I dont feel any urgency to change, not like when I stepped into the asset manager after the financial crisis, Wikramanayake said. Nicholas leaves an amazing legacy. The position we have got genuinely does leave me in an enviable position.
Recommended Interview Women in Asset Management Shemara Wikramanayake: I have never sold a Macquarie share in my 30 years here Shares in Macquarie fell as low as A$119.11 in early Thursday trading following the announcement  a drop of almost 5 per cent  but later recovered somewhat to trade down 2 per cent at A$122.12. David Ellis, an analyst at Morningstar, said investors were likely reacting to the change of leadership, given Mr. Moores stellar performance as Chief Executive, as well as conservative guidance for 2019 profits to be in line with the previous year. We like the appointment and see no risk to Macquaries very successful long-term strategy, said Mr Ellis. Ms Wikramanayake is the first female CEO of a major investment bank and asset manager, demonstrating Macquarie is leading the charge in executive diversity.
We like the appointment and see no risk to Macquaries very successful long-term strategy David Ellis, Morningstar None of the big US investment banks  JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley  have appointed a female as chief executive despite recent efforts to boost gender diversity in executive ranks.

MCC bends rules, allows members to attend match without a jacket
The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), in a rare concession, allowed the members to attend a match without a jacket due to the high temperatures. The MCC, owner of Lord's cricket ground in London and the guardian of the laws of the game, normally insists on a strict code dress for the members.
However, the august body had to bend their rules a bit, courtesy the high temperatures in London that reached an estimated 34 degree Celsius. Due to the abnormally warm temperatures, MCC has decided to dispense with requirement for gentlemen to wear jackets in the pavilion and arrive wearing one. This applies to members of MCC and Middlesex and their guests, tweeted the official account of Lord's Cricket Ground. Gentlemen shall wear lounge suits or tailored jacket and trousers, shirt, tie or cravat and shoes with socks, reads their protocol. Women must wear: dresses; or skirts or trousers (which may be cropped below the knee) or culottes, with blouses or smart tops, and formal shoes, boots or sandals. The Members attended the T20 match between Middlesex and Hampshire at the Lord's without their jackets. Normally, they can be spotted by their red-and-gold striped ties. In the T20 match, Middlesex beat Hampshire by 22 runs to register their second win in the T20 Blast.
Batting first, Middlesex put up a competitive total of 165/8 as Paul Stirling hit 60 off 44 balls and then Dwayne Bravo added more 20 runs in 11 balls.
In reply, Hampshire were bowled out for 143 as spinner Ashton Agar and pacer Steven Finn shared six wickets between them. While Agar finished the match with figures of 3/17, Finn ended the match with figures of 3/21.
