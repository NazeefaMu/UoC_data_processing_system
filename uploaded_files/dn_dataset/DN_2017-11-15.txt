Its over - dismay, disbelief as Italy miss World Cup
Rome: Italys failure to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in 60 years was greeted by a mixture of disbelief, dismay and resigned disappointment by fans across the country.
In Romes trendy San Lorenzo district, the Le Mura bar, which showed Monday nights playoff crunch with Sweden on a big screen, emptied at the final whistle after a goalless stalemate which condemned the Azzurri to a 1-0 aggregate defeat.
It is really very sad because watching the World Cup was something that really brought us together as Italians, said recent graduate Stefania Pusateri, heading for the exit.
But what is sure is that the shock will be even worse for my father. He is 54 years old and he has never had to go through something like this.
Sitting alongside Pusateri, friend Davide Penna concurred. I still cant believe it has happened, he said. We have never experienced anything like this. Its over.
Similar sentiments were voiced by fans coming out of the San Siro stadium in Milan after Mondays 0-0 draw.
I am disappointed with the whole football system in Italy, said Mirko Palmieri. It is the umpteenth failure of our country. Even here (at the San Siro), we cant get the job done.
Italy not being at the World Cup will be a new experience for most of the countrys fans, and few of them are looking forward to the experience of watching from the sidelines. The four-time champions opted not to play at the first World Cup in 1930 but they have been present at every other edition apart from 1958, when they also failed to qualify.
I was born with Italy being a part of the World Cup, and it has always been like that, one supporter told AFP on his way out of the Milan stadium.
Tomorrow I will wake up and my life will go on but this summer I will do something else.
Another added: The disappointment is a double one - first because we are not good, but second because we were beaten by a team that is even worse than us.

ACCA holds workshop on  'Blending insights, technology and psychology for smart  decision making'
ACCA (the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) has always placed Continuous Professional Development (CPD) as a key factor that has contributed towards providing their students and members with the knowledge and skills they need to excel in their careers and advance the business skills required for their day-to-day jobs, as well as enhance their employability for the future.
ACCAs approach to CPD is designed to help students and members maintain and develop the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in todays dynamic and demanding business environment. This has resulted in ACCA conducting many valuable workshops and webinars that provide the relevant insights and training to assist students and members keep their knowledge up-to-date and learn the relevant trends in the current and future market place.
A recent workshop of this nature was held on the topic of 'Blending Insights, Technology and Psychology for Smart Decision Making'.
With the role of the finance professional rapidly changing to that of being a strategic decision maker in a business, this workshop gave participants an insight into the process of understanding the dynamics of decision-making, whilst dealing with lots of different people throughout the organizational hierarchy. Drawing on insights from neurology, psychology, economics, and beyond, coupled with the added complexity of the digital disruption and the deluge of data enabled by social, mobile and cloud technologies happening at present, the workshop discussed the aspect of whether having more information necessarily led to better decision making.
Areas perused included decision making versus problem solving, which explored and discussed the difference between the two and how they are mostly used interchangeably in practice. The constraints, modifications and manipulations involved in these processes were also analyzed. Also touched upon were aspects to consider in arriving at the right decision, as well as examining the different styles of leadership that would result in smart decision making.
The keynote speaker at the workshop was Chaaminda Kumarasiri, Founder/CEO of The Human Capital Partner and the Chairman of H.C.P. Consulting (Pvt) Ltd.
Chaaminda, having fast tracked the career ladder to serve at senior leadership positions of world class multinational organizations as well as local blue chips, both in the state sector and private sector, at a relatively young age, while gaining a vast amount of hands on experience and exposure, has founded Human Capital Partner to help business entities in Sri Lanka to source high quality executives and to develop their human capital via a range of innovative executive development programs. He launched H.C.P. Consulting; an end-to-end business consulting firm to provide high quality consulting and grooming services to the SME sector including the start-ups as a one-stop-shop in their growth strategy. Chaaminda is also a fellow member of ACCA with a range of other professional and academic qualifications.
Commenting on the workshop, the head of ACCA, Nilusha Ranasinghe said, The importance of continuing professional development cannot be underestimated. The ultimate outcome of a well planned CPD program is that it gives sustainable value to both the employer and the professional and will have a positive effect on the professionals career. We at ACCA strongly believe that CPD is a career-long obligation for practising professionals and we hope to continue in having workshops of this nature for the benefit of both our members and our students.

David Soysa
He was a humble individual
Former Deputy Commissioner of Labour and Founder Chairman of the Foreign Employment Bureau, David Aiya, you left us four years ago with our hearts bleeding and our eyes full of tears and yet those memories of your presence and closeness still lingers on. Born to a family of eight children as the eldest son of late Henry Peter De Soysa and Melka Allan Jayamanne, my Brother-in-Law David Soysa was brought up in Negombo.
Being a very methodical person by nature, he had guided and looked after his three sisters and four brothers. As a result of the conditions maintained at home, all of them have become very methodical, capable and disciplined persons.
David Soysa had his primary and secondary education at St. Mary's Collage, Negombo and at the age of 18, he joined the Peradeniya University and achieved a BSc. Economics Hons. Degree with Second Upper Class. Apart from his academic work, he had been an active member of the University's Economics Society.
He started his career as a teacher at Maris Stella College, Negombo and thereafter appeared for SLAS Examination and became first in the island. With this development, he joined the Labour Ministry as a Labour Officer and served in different areas of the island such as Kurunegala, Hatton, Chilaw etc. He married Clauda Madurawela of Thoppu, Kochchikade, in 1964. He was a son-in-law of the late Augustin Madurawela and Catherine Wijesooriya.
Due to his commitment and dedication, he was promoted to the position of Assistant Commissioner of Labour. As a dedicated government servant, he was a most simple and humble person. He practiced honesty in every deed he carried out in the government service.
He was awarded a scholarship to Australia to follow labour and management education and after a few years, he was awarded another scholarship to the Netherlands and achieved a MSc. He has made many developments in the labour field and he was appointed as Deputy Commissioner of Labour in 1979. During his career in the Labour Ministry, he acted few years as the Editor of Labour Gazette Magazine published by the Labour Department and introduced important articles in order to improve labour-related issues in Sri Lanka.
Soysa, who was a specialist on labour law, has represented Sri Lanka on several occasions at International Labour Organisation (ILO) seminars.
With his exposure both overseas and in Sri Lanka in different fields, he was keen to establish a Bureau for Foreign Employment in order to provide job opportunities to our people and to earn foreign exchange for the country. He drafted the Foreign Employment Act and formed the Bureau of Foreign Employment in 1985. He became the Founder Chairman and initiated many development programmes to improve foreign Employment opportunities for Sri Lankans. He visited most of the Middle East and other countries in Asia and Europe to find job opportunities. He served nearly 10 years as the Chairman of the Bureau and made several developments in the field.
His untiring effort, commitment and foresight has immensely contributed to the growth of assignments undertaken by him in the Labour Department and the Foreign Employment Bureau.
As a loving husband and a father, he fulfilled his duties and obligations to his family as directed and blessed by Almighty God.
He left his beloved wife and two daughters. The eldest daughter, Ruwanthie Weerakoon, is currently serving in the UK as a Medical Officer and the second daughter, Nishanthi Dissanayake, is serving as a teacher in the UK.

Dr. Sarath Abeykoon
He was an icon
I pen these words with deep regret and sorrow for the sudden and untimely death of Dr. Sarath Abeykoon, an oncologist whom our family knew for many years. He was eminent in his field, honourable in his deeds and was a honest personality with amiable qualities. He was an icon as a caring doctor, who strove to treat terminal patients for many years both in government service and in private practice.
We could always count on him without hesitation as a professional who practiced and kept his word, living up to the the Hippocratic Oath. Our family is ever so grateful and appreciative of him for the special dedication and caring shown to our late mother during the time of her illness as far back as 1982. Our family and so many other families ow him our gratitude and appreciation and we wish to state that his longstanding medication, given with a human touch and caring extended with continuous support, prolonged her life for many years after the initial diagnosis.
As the world at large is aware and whoever present at the cemetery would've bore testimony to, a large mass was present and paid their last respects until the coffin was closed. The funeral was embodied with simplified last rites and an unforgettable and exceptional short funeral oration, as it should have been for a highly respected person of such simplicity in comparison to Mother Theresa and Florence Nightingale.
All would agree that his death is a great loss to the medical fraternity and patients as the vacuum left by him will take many more years to fill due to his is incomparable and indispensable contribution to society.
The funeral ceremony, as well as the funeral oration which we witnessed at the cemetery, was of exceptional and of exemplary nature and bore testimony to Dr. Sarath Abeykoon's noble personality. We wish to extend our deepest sympathies to his beloved wife, Dr. Lakshmi and daughter, Dr. Chathuri.
May he attain the Supreme bliss of Nirvana.
Senaratne Family, Dehiwela
Devapriya Welikala
A pillar of support
It is with sadness that I write this appreciation to honour my dear cousin, Priya Welikala who passed away in the United Kingdom. I last spoke to Priya in the nursing home in Warlingham three days before he died and I thank God for the precious moment to pray with him, over the telephone. His daughter Teri took me to see him in Caterham when I was visiting the U.K., a couple of months ago. Back then, Priya's mind was razor sharp and he was determined to get better; he took his walking frame and was walking up and down the garden several times. That was Priya who never gave up.
Priya was an old boy of Richmond College, Galle, (1950-1958) and a graduate of the University of Peradeniya. I remember meeting his parents, Reverend Osmund and his wife (who are related to the Corea Family), when I was a child. I was a classmate of Priya's brother, Sunil, at St.Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia. Sunil went on to marry Shiromie Fernando, who was once a talented Sri Lankan child star. Priya was a pillar of support to all his family.
Devapriya Welikala had a distinguished career as a leading banker in Sri Lanka, with the Bank of Ceylon. He was a one time branch manger of the Bank of Ceylon in Kandy and Kalutara and also worked in the Head Office of the bank in Colombo. Priya was posted to London, UK, as Country Manager of the the Bank of Ceylon and that's when I first met him, when he came to stay with us in the 1970's, in Upper Norwood, South East London.
My parents had joined the Worldwide Evangelization Crusade, working at Radio Worldwide and Priya's first port of call was to our small family flat at RW. We got to know him so well. He joined the prayer meetings and times of fellowship at RW and travelled to the bank headquarters from our home. We so looked forward to him returning to our home in the eveningshe was very much a part of our family.
My grand uncle J. C. A. Corea decided to throw a birthday party for me in the 1970's in his flat in Muswell Hill. Priya's wife Nadani and children Ossie, Edward and Teri were flying into Heathrow from Colombo that day. Priya made it a point to bring the whole family to Muswell Hill in North London for my birthdaysuch was his love for us.
Priya was a kind, caring, thoughtful human being. I will never forget when my grandmother suddenly passed away in Wimbledon, Priya and Nadani made several visits to our home with food and spent time with us. He had such a heart for the vulnerable. Priya was a founding member of the registered British charity, Deaf and Blind Sri Lanka, he was the charity's Treasurer. Priya and the DABAL Committee raised thousands of Pounds for deaf and blind schools across Sri Lanka. He had worked very closely with Lord Colin Low of Dalston, Patron of DABAL in the United Kingdom. Together with his wife Nadani, Priya had worked tirelessly for the deaf and blind community in Sri Lanka. A few years ago, Priya and Nadani visited some of the schools in the island.
Their commitment to the vulnerable led them to receive an invitation to St. James's Palace in London, from Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. This reception was held at the Palace prior to the Prince visiting Sri Lanka, to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting (CHOGM) in 2013. They were both introduced to the Prince of Wales by Dr. Chris Nonis, who was Sri Lanka's diplomatic representative to the Court of St. Jame's at the time. It was a wonderful occasion for both Priya and Nadani. He was very humble about his visit to St. James's Palace.
Priya was a practicing Christian. He believed in Jesus Christ as his Lord and Saviour. He read his Bible regularly and was a man of prayer. Priya knew his final destination and we believe that he is in Heaven, gazing at his Lord and Saviour and so, Psalm 23 comes to my mind:
Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
May you rest in peace Priya, in the loving arms of Jesus.

T.T. Jayaratnam
An erudite educator
I am honored to write this note on my memories of the late T. T. Jayaratnam, former Principal of Mahajana College, Tellippalai, when teachers and old students celebrated his birth anniversary on October 29.
I am proud that my family members and I have associated with Mahajana College in the early days when it was established during Pavalars and Jayaratnam's time. My father and Jayaratnam were classmates in early 1920s at Tellippalai Mahajana College when his father, Pavalar, was its head. My two sisters and I were his students at the college throughout our secondary education. Further, all my four children also had their education at Mahajana College from grade one to Advanced Level. At present, four of my grandchildren are studying there. The close engagement of my family with the College now continues to the fourth generation of my father.
The image of the post of principal of J/Mahajana College, Tellippalai, was undoubtedly glorified during the period late Jayaratnam took the mantle. He was an example to other principals during that period. His devotion to the College progressively developed its standards in all aspects to become a preferred institution in the peninsula. In his period, Mahajana College excelled in education and sports and in testimony to that, today, there are many professionals and others holding high posts around the world. Apart from this, Mahajana College became champions in football for consecutive years. Even today, students of Mahajana College show excellent performance in sports at a national level.
He was born on the October 15, 1913, Jayaratnam and passed away on October 29, 1976, having served in this college as a teacher and principal from 1932 to 1970.
He was admitted to Saivapragasa Vidyasalai, Tellippalai, in 1917, of which his father was the manager. He left this Vidyasalai in the year 1919 and joined Mahajana English High School, which was founded by his father. He passed the English School Leaving Certificate Examination in the first division in the year 1924. Records reveal that he was a student of Jaffna Hindu College and successful in the London Matriculation Examination in 1930. Thereafter, he was admitted to Jaffna College, Vaddukkoddai, in the year 1931. On passing the London Inter-arts Examination, he was appointed as a teacher on April 27, 1932. He was selected for training as an English teacher at the Government Training College, Colombo, in the year 1936 and obtained a distinction, being the only candidate from the Jaffna district.
His marriage to Raniratnam took place in 1942 and his family expanded with the birth of his daughter Jayabawani in the year 1945, son Jayakumaran in the year 1948, son Jayakanthan in 1950 and daughter Jayavani in 1953. In addition, his mother, Thaiyalnayakam too was living with him till her death in 1954. Following the demise of the Founder of Mahajana English High School T. A. Thuraiappapillai in the year 1929, the post of principal fell on the shoulders of K. Chinnappaha close relative of Pavalar under whom the school celebrated its silver jubilee in the year 1935. The first issue of 'Mahajanan' (yearly magazine) was also launched that year and Jayaratnam functioned as its first editor. This magazine became very prominent, recording the history of Mahajana College during the time of late Jayaratnam.
K. Chinnappa passed away on March 3, 1946 and the post of principal fell on the shoulders of Jayaratnam. There were 15 teachers and 400 students at the time. At this juncture, the school was renamed as 'Mahajana College.'
At the time of my admission to this College in January 1947, the physical structure was the T hall comprising four classrooms on the west, three on the north in between a small classroom as the library and a playground on the north.
The ambition of our principal was the development of the college in various ways. Laboratories for Physics, Chemistry and Biology were constructed on the eastern side of the College. The achievement of the college in the field of education, sports, drama etc., attracted many parents from other provinces to send their children to the college. For their convenient stay, a hostel was constructed at the north of the college premises. A silver jubilee during his tenure as a teacher and a golden jubilee and diamond jubilee during his service as a principal, were celebrated on grand scales.
Besides being a duty-conscious principal, top positions in the Jaffna School Soccer Association, Durgadevi temple, Lions Club and the Northern Province Teachers Association, were thrust upon him, which he accepted with his smiling face.
Late S. F. de Silva, one-time Director of Education, in his article in Jayaratnam Birth Centenary Malar under caption 'Erudite son of an illustrious father,' had quoted what one of his lecturers said;
'I can still recall vivid memories of T. T. Jayaratnam as one of the most energetic and industrious students, whose young and intelligent look was always fastened to my face during lectures. I came to like him very much not only because he was an excellent student, but also for his qualities and character. He was a lovable person and his quiet an unassuming charm of manner was a great asset to him and his relations with others. He was a man of a quiet and thoughtful nature, with the strength of mind to stand very firmly by his convictions.'
Even after the takeover of school by the government in 1960, the standards of education at Mahajana College continued to maintain its mark, as 10 of its students were admitted to the medical faculty in the year 1968. Teachers were transferred to and out of Mahajana College, though it was not to his liking. The so-called political revolution in the country in May, 1970, brought in a thunderbolt to retire principals over 55 years of age. Thus, the last day of Jayaratnams post of principal abruptly ended on December 31, 1970. Mahajanans scattered all over the world continue to celebrate Jayaratnams anniversary every year on October 29.

Australia votes 'yes' to same-sex marriage
Celebrations broke out across Australia after a two-month national postal survey came out "overwhelmingly" in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage.
Results released Wednesday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed 61% of the population voted to allow same-sex marriage, with 38% voting against.
Rainbow-colored smoke, confetti and cheers erupted in the center of Melbourne following the announcement, where hundreds of people had gathered to hear the result.
When couple Jane Mahoney, 28, and Josie Lennie, 26, heard the result they collapsed into each others' arms in tears. "(Now) we need to save and also gets lots of fun ideas from the other gay weddings," they told CNN. Mahoney and Lennie said they were "over the moon" with the result.
More than 12.7 million people across the country, or 79.5% of the population, took part in the survey with every state and territory returning a majority "yes." Celebrations, singing and tears greeted the announcement in Melbourne. It's the beginning of the end of a long-running campaign to allow marriage equality in Australia, something already legal in the majority of English-speaking countries worldwide.
People in the crowd celebrate as the result is announced in Melbourne on November 15. Speaking after the result, Australia Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said it had been an "overwhelming" response in favor of "yes" and called for same-sex marriage to be legalized before Christmas. "They voted 'yes' for fairness, they voted 'yes' for commitment, they voted 'yes' for love. And now it is up to us here in the Parliament of Australia to get on with it," he told reporters in Canberra.
Opposition Labor Party leader Bill Shorten told the Melbourne rally the postal vote itself should never have happened. "I feel for young people who had their relationships questioned in a way I wouldn't have thought we would see ever again, but nevertheless what this marriage equality survey shows is that unconditional love always has the last word," he said. Politicians are expected to begin discussing the specifics of the same-sex marriage bill as early as this week. However, even ahead of the release of the results, conservative politicians inside the Australian parliament were preparing for a fight over how marriage equality would be legalized. Prominent supporters of same-sex marriage celebrated the decision. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce danced on stage in Sydney with author and actor Magda Szubanski, and urged Turnbull to "get on with it." Australian Olympic champion Ian Thorpe warned conservative politicians against delaying the legislation.
"(The result) spells it out loud and clear ... If they play around with this issue any longer, it will be at their peril," he told reporters Wednesday morning. 'We didn't want the vote' Australia's LGBT community was strongly against the idea of a national vote on same-sex marriage from the first time it was announced, fearing a bitter, divisive campaign. A group of same-sex marriage advocates even took the government to Australia's High Court in an attempt to stave off the survey. Their case was dismissed in an unanimous decision.
The two-month campaign was marred by harsh rhetoric and wild allegations of the consequences of a "yes" vote. Rainbow flags were sprayed with Nazi symbols in Brisbanewhile "no" advertisements claimed same-sex marriage would lead to "radical gay sex" education in schools. Speaking after the "yes" result on Wednesday, Jacob Coleman, 28, and his husband Damien O'Mara, 29, said they still believed the survey was "wrong."
"We didn't want the vote in the first place but we are so happy to have this win for our friends and the whole community," Coleman told CNN.
"The vote has helped to speed up the process but the true lesson here is that the process is wrong." Coleman and O'Mara were married in Scotland two years ago.
Australians long in favor of marriage equality Australians have long been in favor of marriage equality, but multiple governments have maintained they wanted to

Behind the mask
Masks play an important role in the classical, folk and ritual dance forms of South Asia and South East Asian countries. In Indian classical dance forms, as well as in the Indian dance dramas, masks play a major role. Along with the full face covered masks, side face masks covering the ears and side of the face, especially designed crowns or kiridams and distinct make-up play a major role in the mask dances.
Among the Indian classical dance forms, Kathakali is the most popular due to its distinct Akariya Abhinaya (makeup and dresses). Because of its distinct makeup, beautifully carved and broad colourful crown or Kiridams and side masks fully covered facial masks or side face masks have added more to the beauty of this dance form. Similarly, Yakshagana, a classical dance form of Karnataka, resembles the Kathakali, mainly in the make-up and in the use of masks.
[SUBHEAD] Ritual dances
Even in some of the folk dances, the masks play an important role. For instance, in Tamil Nadu, popular folk dances such as Therukoothu, Nattukoothu and some other regional folk dances and ritual dances, side masks play an important role. Generally, all the mask dances have some similarities mainly in the stances (standing position), the steps of the dances, as well as in the turns, jumps, twists and various other vigorous movements. In West Bengal, there are two popular mask dances practiced during the Sun Festival.
Gambhira is a Bengali mask dance. But it is essentially a solo dance. Ordinary people believe that there is a magical and religious influence in these dance forms. All these Indian classical mask dance forms are based on the ancient religious and epic themes.
Besides these Indian classical dance forms, in Bharatha Natyam, a new branch of dance concept was developed during the mid-20th century called dance drama. The theme of the dance and dramas are based on relation. Numerous multi characters are involved in dance drama. Each character has a distinct make-up and dress, to the need and necessity. Sometimes they wear masks. As a drama, dance drama gives more importance to each characters dress, makeup and the stage dcor of the selective scene portrayed.
For instance, in Ramayana dance drama, different characters such as Hanuman, Vaali, Sukirivan, Jaddauyu and Jaampavaan are involved. Each character wears different masks. Ramayana is the most important theme among the Indian and South East Asian dances. In the annual Rama Lila festival, in the North Indian states, the actors or the characters wear masks or semi - masks for their roles.
Dance-based play
In Sri Lanka, numerous mask dances are performed. Some are story based mask dances, others are for amusement. Meanwhile, some masks are used for rituals. The Kolam is considered as a dance-based play. In this dance, a variety of characters are involved. Each character wears a mask for their distinct character. In Kolam, masks are made with appropriate expressions and emotions of each character.
Another important mask dance of South Sri Lanka is Sanniyakuma. There are altogether 18 Sanni demons to cure 18 types of diseases. Each Sanni demon has a particular name and each demon is supposed to heal a particular disease. The dancers representing these demons wear black costumes and a skirt decorated with leaves and wear specific masks.
Masks play an important role in the South East Asian dances. The South East Asian region comprises Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Java, Sumatra, Indonesia and Bali. Due to the
Indian migration to the South East Asian region for various purposes, this region came under the Indian influence mainly in cultural, linguistic and religious spheres. In Thailand, the themes of the dances are firmly based on Ramayana and Mahabharata.
Classical mask dance
Women, who play an important role in these dances, wear masks, especially for certain roles, like monkeys, demons and devas. Khon, another popular Thai classical mask dance form is based on a series of stories. A variety of characters is involved in these story-based dances. Hence they wear different masks that depict emotional expressions.
In Bali, one of the most popular dance forms is performed in a common place called Barong Rangda. It is a mask dance which reveals the struggle between good and evil. Balinese dance tradition is a fusion of Hindu and Islamic culture. One of the dances is called Wayang Topeng. It is a solo mask dance form which derives its theme from Hindu legends.
Mask dances generally impart various traditional and religious truths. They impact on values of average humans. Sometimes these dances are performed during the festival season for amusement and pleasure. In such mask dances, the comedian or the clown impresses the audience a lot. Some of the mask dances are used for ritual purposes to get rid of evil effects and sickness.

Emirates pioneered the First Class private suite concept back in 2003, and today its the industry benchmark when it comes to first class travel. Over the years we have continually improved on our private suites, adding thoughtful refinements and features.
We are very excited about our new fully-enclosed suite which is a real game-changer in terms of privacy, comfort, and thoughtful luxury. This is the first time an Emirates product has been so influenced by another luxury brand, but it is a natural fit as both Emirates and Mercedes-Benz have the same unwavering commitment to fine detail, uncompromising quality, and a drive to push the boundaries.
Emirates latest First Class product gives a nod to the design philosophy of the Mercedes-Benz S- Class, bringing together two global brands renowned for innovation, luxury, and comfort. The collaboration inspired several design details in the private suite including the soft leather seating, high-tech control panels, and mood lighting.

Budget office to open in Parliament next year
A Budget office will be set up in the parliament by end of 2018, State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne said.
This is in an effort to improve accountability and transparency of public finance. He made these views speaking at a post budget seminar, organized by the Institute of Certified Management Accountants (CMA) of Sri Lanka in Colombo yesterday.
Over the last six to seven decades, the country had to rely on numbers provided by the Central Bank and the Finance Ministry and the parliamentarians didnt have an independent way to double check those numbers and data given by these two institutions.
In addition, to monitor and look at practical issues during the implementation process of budget proposals on a regular basis, a budget proposals monitoring unit will be set up at the Finance Ministry.
From an accountability point of view, things are moving in the right direction. There are lots of legal impediments or limitations in the law that need to be amended to suit the present needs, he said.
The Minister said it is proposed to introduce Public Finance Management Act, National Audit Act and Public Enterprise Act in the future to address issues relating to the respective sectors. The Minister also noted that there are several other Acts that need amendments and reforms which also include new Customs Act.
Commenting on public sector reforms, the Minister claimed; one thing that is holding back the growth of the country is the public sector. Within a short period of time, the public sector was nearly doubled by the former government and it didnt increase the efficiency or services provided by the public sector to the general public.
The Minister also noted that delays in the law are holding back the economy and that things were not getting resolved in a speedy manner. And it is also causing injustice for the people who are waiting for a resolution.The Minister also emphasised that no presently existing social programs has been curtailed or cut by the present government and all the social programs have been retained as in the past. The Minister further noted the government is hoping to bring in a new Act in 2018 which will enable the state to give ownership to other Sri Lankans who are dispossessed and dont have the ownership of their home.

The proposed budget proposals although principally acceptable need a few practical changes to be really meaningful said vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka (VIAL) Chairman Indika Sampath Merenchige.
He said they would be lobbying to reintroduce the unit rate of Rs 1750 for 1250 cc to 1,500 cc categories which would be beneficial for both the customer and country alike.
Similarity they would also request to revoke the categorization of used electric cars and brand new electric cars for tax calculation, for the proposals to be really practical.
Apart from these concerns the association has no other big hiccups with the budget proposals Merenchige asserted.

Budget proposals will help ease North-East poverty: Swaminathan
Prison Reforms, Resettlement, Rehabilitation and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M. Swaminathan expressed optimism that the proposals in the budget, in relation to the war-ravaged Northern and EasternProvinces, will ease poverty by the end of 2018.
The budget proposals are mainly aimed at reducing the cost of living and some specific proposals will immensely benefit the people of the two poverty-stricken provinces, he said.
The proposal to allocate Rs.1,000 million for grants and low interest loans (soft-loans) to those trapped in debts in the two provinces, the allocation of Rs.3,000 million to build houses to resettle those affected in the conflict, irrigation projects and water tanks, an Economic Zone in Achchuvely, Jaffna, resettlement of 12,000 ex-combatants and special projects for war widows are some of the proposals, Swaminathan said. The national unity government, in the last two years, achieved much towards reducing poverty levels which were higher compared to the other provinces of the country.
The government enhanced fund allocations by several folds and implemented far-reaching livelihood programmes to reduce poverty levels.
The worst-affected Mullaitivu district had recorded a drop in poverty level from 24.5 last year to 12.5 percent this year, the Minister said adding that similar reductions in poverty levels were being achieved in several other districts.

China juniors to play 16 German clubs
BERLIN : China's Under-20 team will on Saturday play the first of 16 planned friendlies against German fourth-division opposition in a controversial experiment aimed at advancing the Asian superpower's chances at the 2020 Olympics.
China's government, led by football fan President Xi Jinping, is investing in the sport in the hope of ending years of national underachievement.
Angela Merkel's German government signed a five-year football partnership agreement with China's vice-premier Liu Yandong last November.
As a result, China's under-20 men's national squad will play a series of friendly matches in Germany over the next six months to help develop them with an eye on the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
In a distinctive red strip, with alternate colours of yellow and white, China's under-20s will play clubs in Germany's fourth-tier Regionalliga Suedwest (south-west regional league), but will not be included in the league table. Three teams have refused to face the Chinese, but the other 16 clubs in the 19-strong league will each be paid 15,000 euros ($17,634) for playing the under-20 team.
It is the first time a junior national team will play a series of games against clubs in the German league pyramid. On Saturday, TSV Schott Mainz will become the first club to face the Chinese juniors, who will be housed in Teistungen, central Germany, and travel by bus to their matches, which run until May next year.
Koblenz, Stuttgarter Kickers and Waldhof Mannheim are the three teams who have refused to face the Chinese after their fans protested.
Offenbach, currently second in the league, will face the Chinese next May, but their coach is one of those against the experiment.
We have to carry the can for something the politicians and the German FA parcelled up for us, Offenbach coach Oliver Reck told German daily Bild. I have nothing against the Chinese, but why do we have to do that   AFP

Ranjan Ramanayake and justice
The legal fraternity is as human, fallible and imperfect as members of all other walks of life. They must also be regarded as equal before the law as everybody else. This although obvious has to be said as often, some members of the legal profession act as if they were unimpeachable. Recently President Trump called the American system of justice A joke and a laughing stock.
A lawyer is entitled to practise his profession after securing the necessary academic qualifications and following other formalities and taking oaths. However none of this ensures his moral superiority, impartiality, or immunity to acquisitiveness or any other human failing.
Some spokesmen for the lawyers claimed that Ramanayake insulted the states judiciary which was never done. What he did was to criticize the conduct of only some of them. He said that ninety percent of the lawyers defended criminals. While this may be true we cannot blame them, for every criminal has a right to legal representation and the lawyer has a right to defend them and engage in his means of livelihood. At the same time Ramanayake has a right to interpret defending a criminal as unethical or corrupt. He also recalled specific instances of judges acting in violation of their professional ethics.
The media has also from time to time exposed members of the judiciary who have engaged in criminal activities and received punishment. If Ramanayake is called upon to justify his allegations before court, the media would be full of unsavory material, mainly to the legal fraternity.
Ranjan Ramanayake clearly stands out as one of the very few parliamentarians who have been honourable, outspoken and championing the cause of the unprivileged as a true representative of the people, in a manner worthy of emulation.

## Title: Closing the gender gap

Closing the gender gap
According to the latest reports, Sri Lanka is ranked 109 out of 144 countries in the Global Gender Gap Index. The country has dropped nine places in comparison to last year.
The Global Gender Gap Index is designed to measure gender equality. The Index ranks countries according to calculated gender gap between women and men in four key areas: Economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival and political empowerment.
The index is mainly concerned about the disadvantages compared to men. Gender imbalances to the advantage of women do not affect the score. For example, the indicator number of years of a female head of state (last 50 years) over male value would score 1 if the number of years was 26, but would still score 1 if the number of years was 50. According to this methodology, gender gaps that favour women over men are reported as equality.
Policy interventions
Sri Lanka gained 98.6% and ranked No-1 in Health and survival. (No -01 and few other ranks were shared by a number of countries.) In economic participation, Sri Lanka was ranked 123th with 54% score. In education attainment the score was 98% but ranked 123. Our worst performance was for political empowerment. We scored only 19% and positioned in 65th place. Our overall score was 67% and ranked in 109th position.
The three highest ranking countries have closed over 83% of their gender gaps, while the lowest ranking country has closed only a little over 52% of its gender gap.
The component indicators show us the areas in need of critical policy intervention and it also stimulates us to think proactively and to implement new public policy to overcome systematic disadvantages of our women.
The writer intends to discuss briefly about the political empowerment of our women in this piece of writing.
Low participation
Women represent almost 52% of the total population in Sri Lanka. They are reported as highest foreign exchange earners in Sri Lanka, declaring 5.8 billion US$ in the year 2015 through migrating as housemaids. The other highest foreign exchange generating industries are Textile and Garment (Us$ 4.8 billion), Tea (US$ 1.3 billion) in the same year. Statistics indicate that the labour force used in these sectors are mostly female.
There is no denying the fact that greater participation of women in the political process would be a pre-condition for their economic and social emancipation. However, even though a significantly large number of women vote in the country, yet only a few of them assume the reins of power.
Paradoxically, though women have held the posts of President, Prime Minister, Chief Justice as well as Ministers, the country ranks very low in terms of representation of women in legislative bodies. The womens political representation in the country is a negligible proportion reporting 5% of parliamentary seats, 4% of seats in provincial councils, and 2% of seats in local government. Sri Lanka ranked 180th out of 190 in the IPU ranking of female representation in Parliament as of July 2017.
Remedy
To remedy the low participation of women electors, the Parliament passed the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act No. 1 of 2016 to increase womens representation at the local government level. Following the amendment, a 25% mandatory quota for women was introduced through a one-third increase in the total number of seats at the local authority level.
The quota stipulated in the amended Act will result in a dramatic increase in the number of women elected to local government. i.e from 2% to 25% (in actual numbers from around 82 to over 2000 elected women). According to the amendment, the quota does not bar women from obtaining nominations at the ward level or the general PR list. Theoretically therefore womens representation can surpass 25% at local level.
The Government also increased the number of female representatives in Provincial Councils. The recently gazetted Bill seeks to amend the Provincial Councils Elections Act, No.2 of 1988. This makes it binding on all political parties and independent groups to field at least 30 per cent female candidates in Provincial Council elections.
This writer believes that just increasing the number of women in provincial and local government may not guarantee a great impact on governance. The political parties should field qualified and capable women to have a positive impact on the functions of local bodies. Above all, they should possess highest levels of honesty and integrity. Then only we could expect radical changes in the decision-making process at grassroot level.
However, a critical mass of women in power can bringabout transformation in leadership decisions.
Reasons
In a Report by Law and Society Trust  (2016) titled Womens Political Representation in Local Government Institutes, the following reasons are given for the low participation of women in politics in Sri Lanka. The reasons were identified after a series of discussions.
1. The proportionate rate system of elections has largely reduced the womens participation in politics. To have popularity in a district, a large expense has to be incurred. Women are incapable of accumulating that much money from sponsors as women have not yet seen as competent competitors in the elections.
2. Social media and extensive speed of spreading rumours damage the dignity and respectfulness of people. Social media is filled with slander at the politicians and new entrees especially women will be discouraged through these forms of insults. These forms of insults have an adverse effect on womens political representation.
3. Political culture and violence prevailing in the society is seen as an obstacle for women to enter into the politics.
4. The sheer goal of the political parties is to win and therefore popularity will be a key factor to get appointed to the list. Therefore, a difference in considerations between the members in the civil society and political parties will exist.
5. Although recently gazetted locating a list to increase the womens political participation in local government bodies is promising, there is a fear whether the proper appointment would made to the list. Revisiting the past experiences indicates that there is a trend of irregular appointments to the national list by political parties. (In most instances, access to power tends to emerge from familial, communal and economic linkages.)
6. Political institutions are seen as a male domain geared towards accommodating the male preference. For an example, some of the meetings of political parties are held at the weekends and would end mostly at midnight. Thus, does not allow the women to participate.
7. Womens mentality is set by the socio-cultural attitudes to think that mans success is her success. Society too looks at the success as the image of a man. Political culture of Sri Lanka reflects the similar tradition existing in the society.
8. There is a huge gap between political parties and the civil society.
Limitations
It has been universally believed that the quantity (and quality) and of womens participation in politics is determined by 3 factors. (a) Political rights given to women by law, (b) The mental attitude of a society towards womens liberation, (c) Extent of access and entry available for women to different vital sectors of social life i.e. economy, communication decision making in the community social freedom in relationships, associations etc.
Lack of financial resources can limit participation given the costs associated with elections. Independent funding and placing limits on campaign spending may support women in overcoming the barriers to political participation. Norms about womens appropriate roles and leadership capabilities also shape both aspirations and opportunities. In countries where women have historically been present in public life, barriers are minimum or do not exist at all.
Sri Lankan women still continue to grapple with the same old questions of experiencing high levels of gender based violence, womens labour force participation. Estimates indicate that women represent just over one third of the working population. Women continue to be under represented in upper level management and decision-making positions in both the private and public sector.
The question remains unanswered. Why havent gains in education translated to economically independent and politically empowered women in Sri Lanka

COLVIN  TROTSKYITE, HUMANIST AND THE WITTIEST
Colvin Reginald de Silva, a multi-dimensional character was born 110 years ago in Ambalangoda on February 16. He had his preliminary education at St Johns College, Panadura, from where he entered Royal College, Colombo. Islands number one criminal lawyer in 1940 and 50s, he vehemently opposed the Capital Punishment. He who defended murder suspects knew he could earn a higher fee only if the practice of hanging continued, but our humanist had other ideas.
of all things that state may take away from a man there is one thing that which if you take away you cannot only not return, but can never compensate him for and that is his lifethe idea is punishment instead of creating an opportunity for healingit is an old and outmoded utterly unreasonable approach. Let us move away from the principle of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. --Colvin R de Silva, speaking on the Suspension of Death Penalty Bill 60 years ago -- [Hansard-1956: col. 548/564]
One language, two nations; Two languages, one Nation
Then again, participating in Official Language (Sinhala only) Bill debate in Parliament in 1956, he stated,  Do we want an independent Ceylon or two bleeding halves of Ceylon which can be gobbled up by every ravaging imperialist monster that may happen to range the Indian Ocean These are issues that in fact we have been discussing under the form and appearance of the language issue One language, two nations; Two languages, one Nation
Colvin the anti-racist
Addressing the Parliament during the debate on Citizenship Bill 1948, introduced by D S Senanayake government that deprived the voting rights of Indian Estate labour, Dr Colvin said, Racialism is a handy weapon of reaction. But I would remind this government, even though the reminder may prove historically useless, that there are weapons which reaction has handled in the past and which have been ultimately destructive of the reaction itself we by opposing this, will also have taken the first step towards that ultimate consummation, namely, the ending both of this government and of the system which it represents and defends -- -Hansard-August 3, 1948-col. 1711
An Anglo-Australian Marxist revolutionary, Mark Anthony Bracegirdle sailed to Ceylon in 1936, where he learned the trade of tea-planting. Bracegirdle was working among the Tamil plantation labourers who were treated inhumanely; living in line rooms which were worse than cattle sheds. Europeans dismissed him for taking the side of labour. On November 28, 1936, at a meeting in Colombo, the president of the LSSP, Dr Colvin R. de Silva, introduced him, saying: This is the first time a white comrade has ever attended a party meeting. Comrades, you know we have a white comrade who wishes to address you. Bracegirdle rose and claimed unrivalled knowledge of the misdeeds of the planters and promised shocking exposures.
The white planters prevailed upon the Governor, Sir Stubbs to deport him. Bracegirdle went into hiding while the LSSP started a movement to defend him. On May 5 same year in the State Council, N M Perera and Philip Gunawardena proposed a vote of censure on the Governor for having planned the deportation of Bracegirdle without the recommendation of the acting Home Minister. The vote was passed by 33 votes to 7.
A writ of Habeas Corpus case was called before a Bench of Supreme Court judges. Countys leading civil lawyer then, H.V. Pereira, appeared with young Colvin for Bracegirdle; On May 18 order was made that he might not be deported for applying his right to free speech, and Bracegirdle was freed.
Stripped off of portfolio by Sirima
Colvin was the Minister of Plantations and Constitutional Affairs in United Front coalition led by SLFP from 1970 to 75. He was removed, along with his colleagues Dr NM and Leslie Goonewardene in 1975 by the Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike under the instigation of right-wing led by Felix Dias and Maithreepala Senanayake.
In his usual fluent persuasive style Colvin said, Destabilisation, is an ominous word introduced into the worlds political vocabulary by that most sinister instruments of international subversion the so called CIA, of USA there is reason to believe that USA also is involved behind major political changes. There are major social forces in action, colliding, re-grouping and realigning our little island has become the focus of activity of international forcesthe expulsion of US from Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia turned their eyes on Sri Lanka, which is well placed in relation to the air and sea routes of the Indian Ocean area
his address to the house on their expulsion;: -Hansard-Sep 1975
Colvins witticism
Colvin, who won comfortably the WellawatteGalkissa seat in seat in 1947, was canvassing in Dehiwala during 1952 Parliamentary election. It was in the immediate aftermath of Sathasivam wife murder case where he led the defense and won. One of the constituents, a lady resident down Auburn Side shut the door blaring, If people like you exist, no wife will be safe in this country. The witty man rejoined, Madam thats a judgment on your husbands. He returned to his home base in Agalawatte and won it in 1965 and 1970, but lost along with all leftists in 1977: Colvin competed on principles as a revolutionary and he worked tirelessly for the benefit of masses until his demise on February 27, 1989.
Sun never sets on the British Empire
During WW II, he was jailed by the colonial government along with his colleagues, but they escaped from prison and became exiled in India, where, Colvin joined Indian Bolsheviks and continued to write Articles under the pseudonyms Lily Roy and Govindan.
When Colvin was reading at the London University for his Doctorate thesis, Ceylon under the British Occupation, he was in late-twenties and wasnt a Marxist. Once he was responding to the famous British saying: The Sun never sets on the British Empire, and said: for God does not trust them in the dark! Colvin became world famous defending Sathasivam the cavalier batsman and Captain of the Ceylonese Cricket team in the late 1940s and early 50s, in wife murder case visiting Sir Sydney Smith in Edinburg in connection with the case and during the brief, the Forensic expert asked Colvin to demonstrate how to dress a lady in saree. Colvin confessed that he had no idea, the witty man continued, Sir Sydney, but we know how to undress them.

Courage, little heart!
Little Hearts Project is a dream with the mission and vision of securing the ability to treat up to 10,000 children every year. This is a project to construct and commission a 10-storey Cardiac and critical care complex at the premises of the Lady Ridgeway hospital for children (LRH) at Borella.
This is the premier National Hospital  that treat children under 12 years of age  free of charge. It is estimated that there are about 3000 children born with congenital hearts diseases and other serious heart ailments.
According to Dr. Duminda Samarasinghe, Consultant Paediatric cardiologist, only 1000 cardiac surgeries and 700 catheter based interventions are done every year. Considering the need for multiple surgeries for the same patient  surgeries are prolonged.
The target is to perform 2000 surgeries and 1000 catheter based interventions.
As LRH has over 900 beds, the percentage of ICU beds available is 1-2 %. This is grossly inadequate- and more than 60% of requests made are rejected, and critically ill patients are forced to be treated in general Wards. Which lack ICU beds  posing a risk for the livers of little children.
It is estimated that approximately 1000-1500 children with hearts diseases and critical illnesses are lost every year. Eight out of 1000 newborns leave this world before their first birthday. His or Her chance of survival is less than 50% according to hospital sources.
A request is made to all citizens, media and Religious organizations to promote and find funds for this project in the shortest possible time. The target to complete the complex is rupees 2000 billion.
The government has allocated Rs.300 million and the Civil Engineering Division of the Navy has started construction work. They who give their labour absolutely free.
As citizen of Sri Lanka who reap the benefits of free Health care it is our responsibility to find the funds needed  to save our children  who do not have a voice that could be heard.
They are our future generation  who need our attention and help.
All administrative costs will be borne by well - wishers and guardians of this project. All contributions are tax free.
Derana the principle digital media partner organized a walk in collaboration with the college of Paediatricians Run For Little Hearts on October 27th Sunday. It was a resounding success. Sporting white T-Shirts with a logo of a red heart, The young, the old and even tiny tots joined in the run to show their solidarity. A marathon preceded the event.
Every cent and every rupee count  is the plea of Dr Duminda Samarasinghe  Chairperson of the Little Hearts Project you can contact 071-644-1122(Hot Line) at LRH for future information.
This is not a project for somebody else- Take it as your own project for your own child  as it may be the reality one day.

CPC officials blamed for fuel shortage
The three-member committee appointed by the President Maithripala Sirisena to investigate the cause of the recent fuel shortage revealed that Ceylon Petroleum Corporation officials who knew of the impending crisis had not maintained the normal stocks.
On an average day, Sri Lanka has a storage capacity for 120,000 metric tonnes (MT) of fuel when our daily requirement is only 2000 metric tonnes, committee member Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
The Presidential Committee: Ministers Dr Sarath Amunugama, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and Patali Champika Ranawaka.  
However all systemised inventories had been ignored and stocks had not been maintained at these facilities,he said.
He added that there had been no inventories and neither were higher-ups informed of the impending shortage. We did a graphic presentation and found that by October 17, many knew of the impending crisis, but none had informed the management.
When asked if sabotage was suspected, the Minister added that it had not been ruled out and that an impartial inquiry should be undertaken to ascertain who the culprits are. When I was the Minister, during the 100-days programme, we increased our storage capacity from 60,000 MT to 90,000. LIOC can store up to 15,000 MT and we have an additional 8,000 MT at the depot, he said. We knew when stocks were running low and we had enough time to work out a new shipment.
The Minister elaborating further added that a minimum of 21 days is required to procure and bring into the country another stock and it could have been done, had the higher management been alerted of the situation on October 17.
The report on the fuel crisis signed off by Special Projects Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama was presented to President Maithripala Sirisena at the cabinet meeting in parliament yesterday. The Ministerial sub-committee was appointed by the President to investigate the cause of the islandwide fuel shortage. The committee comprised of Ministers Champika Ranawaka, Dr. Sarath Amunugama and Anura PriyadarshanaYapa.
Among some of the recommendations proposed, it has been suggested that the systemised inventory be utilised again since it provides sufficient notice and time to procure new stocks. We need to make optimal and efficient use of the storage facilities. This way even if there is a surge in demand, the stocks maintained would suffice.
When asked if the Trincomalee oil tanks could be used, as proposed by the Unions, Minister Ranawaka added that while it was a viable option it wasnt the solution.
The tanks need rehabilitation and refurbishment, while it can be done, we dont need it as our storage capacity is sufficient.

FA should turn to Aluko  - UK sports minister
LONDON: Sports minister Tracey Crouch believes the Football Association should hire England women's striker Eni Aluko to improve the governing body's relationships with their players following the Mark Sampson controversy.
In my view they should take Eni Aluko up on her offer to help the FA with those reforms. I think she would be a great asset in terms of helping drive cultural change, she said.
Crouch was speaking to a British parliamentary committee a month after Aluko appeared before the same panel to discuss why she made a bullying and discrimination allegation against former England women's manager Sampson. Sampson was twice cleared following investigations into Aluko's allegations, only to be forced to step down following fresh allegations of an inappropriate relationship with female players during his time at Bristol Academy.
Crouch was asked by the panel if she believes the FA is fit for purpose and whether chairman Greg Clarke and chief executive Martin Glenn are the right people to lead the organisation after they came in for criticism over their handling of the incident.
She said the FA must now show it takes its duty of care to athletes seriously, has a robust grievance procedure in place and fixes its culture, from the top down.  AFP

To feel yourself release
As far back as 1848, Thomas de Quincey wrote a short, but resourceful essay titled as Literature of Knowledge and Literature of Power. This essay became well known due to the deep and sensitive insights invoked in it. At one moment, it is said there is first the literature of knowledge and secondly the literature of power. The function of the first is to teach, the function of the second is to move. The first is a rudder, the second an oar or a sail.
The first speaks to mere discursive understanding. The second speaks ultimately, it may happen to the higher understanding or reason, but always through affections of pleasure and sympathy. For a moment, I was drawn to reread the short essay as a result of deeply, if I may say, engrossed in the reading of a Dhamma text written by a Singaporean Thai monk named Luang Por Teean (1911  1988).
Ultimate interpretation
The 82-page booklet is titled as To One that Feels published by Wisdom Audio Visual Exchange (WAVE). Commencing from the cover illustration to the Pali terms as used in the text, the entire short text is packed with literary and spiritual insights. The learned monk takes into account the explanation of the three terms: Sila, Samadhi and Panna. In most Dhamma texts, Sila is explained as discipline. Samadhi as mindfulness and panna and knowledge. But the writer Luang Por Teean goes several steps ahead in the ultimate interpretation. He takes the inspirational cue from the Buddha which goes as it is to one that feels that I teach Dhamma, not to the one that does not feel.
The awareness pertaining to suffering (dukkha) is taken the basic premise in the interpretation of all human matters of existence. As such, the conceptual awareness is not merely confined to words, but deeds in everyday life. In this regard, the starting point is explained as awareness of ones own self in discipline or sila. The writer monk says that if one is aware of oneself, the moha (delusion) will gradually disappear. In order to achieve this end, one has to concentrate in silence, which is explained as Sati.
The learned monk tries as far as possible to explain the complexity of Dhamma concepts in age-old parables and day to day situations. One fascinating examples is the parable of the cat and the rat. A person can get a cat to get rid of rats. The person knows that the cat is an enemy of the rat. At first the cat may be very small and very weak, while at that moment a rat can be large and full of energy. So if the cat pounces on a rat, it is dragged along as the rat runs away and after holding on for a while it must let go.
Certain hindrance
We cannot blame the cat, but we must feed him. We feed the cat often and soon it is very energetic and very strong. By feeding the cat, the rats at home disappear. This illustrates that one strong power has to be developed in order to get rid of a certain hindrance. As the interpretation goes, if one were to develop Sati, the troublesome thought hindrances like moha and dosa gradually disappear. Giving way to setting up of the mind known as Samadhi is essential for a better lifestyle. How much of time do we devote to the cultivation of our inner peace
It is the question raised quite often. The inner silence helps one gauge ones own troubles at turmoil. As such, the basic advice is to sit or walk slowly or stand as relax in order to know yourself. This exercise can be taught to anybody by anyone who so practices. Majority of people tend to say that they are disturbed. But cant we get rid of the disturbance It is the basic issue, and how do you get rid of it If one cannot get rid of it completely, try as much as possible to get rid of it gradually. There are several exercises.
This comes in the form of boy postures. We as teachers of theatrical exercises follow some of these techniques. The teachers teach us how to sit, how to stand, how to walk. They include all forms of bodily exercises. But little do we know that they are fused to mental exercises as well. It is the concentration that matters in all what we do. We do everything with an awareness. But this has to be cultivated to the point that one has to devote more time to it. In this work, the learned monk tries to answer or respond to some of the questions raised by the audience when he delivers the Dhamma talks.
Wise interlocution
This is usually a popular form of wise interlocution. One question from the audience goes as follows.
When I sit, I can watch the thought, but when I walk to the toilet and intend to see the thoughts, when the thought arises should I stop walking and see the thought or what should I do
The response goes as follows:
You dont have to stop walking. Just be aware of yourself. When we are aware of ourselves, that is Samadhi. Whatever movement we make we will know it. Unintended though twill arise by itself. If do not see it we will attach to it, and this is dukkha. So we come to know the cause of dukkha.
Explaining furthermore, the monk says:
Normally our mind is indifferent. It can think dukkha and we know that it thinks without dukkha. But when we do not see thought, we follow thought, we enter thought, we enter the cave, that is dukkha.
To see thought is difficult for somebody who does not understand, but it is easy for one that understands. To see thought does not concern any kind of work. We can write, and when thought arises we see it. When we walk to the bathroom (as emphasized) or when we are bathing, and it thinks we just see it. So we dont have to do anything with calmness because calmness is already there. The real calmness is when we see thought.
Simplest form
In this manner, Dhamma concepts are explained in the simplest form possible. Exemplifying the Dhamma concepts more clearly, the learned monk tries to interpret the cause and effect in the following manner.
The cause is that we go to work, the effect is that we earn money. The cause is that we study. The effect is that we gain knowledge. So the knowledge is the result of the study. Therefore (he concludes) the cause is to be diligent and the effect will be truly useful.
Developing sati is termed as cause. Gaining pragnna or knowledge is the effect. The learned monk never seems to conclude his concepts. Instead he leaves them to be concluded by oneself by saying: Make the experiment and discover for yourself.
The interpretative chapters are arraigned in a poetic and symbolic manner. They go as graphical illustrations.
It rains hard on a covered thing.
It rains hard on a covered thing.
It rains not hard on an open thing,

So open up the covered thing.
Proceeds to
Then it will not rain hard on that
To

Entering into:

Future of Galle greener than Colombo - Lamudi
There is little argument that both Colombo and the city of Galle are two of the most developed urban regions in Sri Lanka. Whats significantly common about these two regions is that they are not just economically developed, but they are also highly celebrated travel destinations that offer so much for locals as well as international travelers. As such, these regions attract a large number of property hunters, who seek high-end residential or commercial properties in or near these two cities.
The real estate market in Colombo
Being Sri Lankas most developed city, Colombo is home to the widest variety of properties spanning from luxury and mid-range apartments, studio apartments, luxury and mid-range houses, high end and affordable commercial spaces found anywhere in Sri Lanka.
Its growth in infrastructure, technology and economy has resulted in many investment projects which include The Colombo Port City, which draws its first investment of US$ 1 billion in mid-2018.
As a result of the above, when compared to other regions of the country like Galle, Colombo indicates the highest demand for properties that correlates with its increasing prices. Hence the residential properties that you see in Colombo are constructed to offer you the most comfortable life within the city.
According to Lamudi research, vertical living which was introduced to Sri Lanka not so long ago, is gaining the highest popularity within the commercial capital in comparison to cities like Galle. Thus, at present, a property hunter is given a plethora of options such as Altair, Iconic Galaxy, Capitol Twin Peaks and many more to choose from, which aligns with their requirements.
Colombo shows the highest price levels in comparison to other cities, especially for luxury apartments and modern houses. Additionally, an increase in land prices was also observed in the city of Colombo over the recent past.
Currently, average luxury apartment sale prices range between Rs 60 million  Rs 100 million. Luxury houses with a minimum of 2 bedrooms indicate an average sale price of Rs 10 million  Rs 50 million. The rental prices for commercial spaces in Colombo indicate an average price between Rs 50,000  Rs 100,000 per month. However, price levels for such properties vary according to consumer requirements, facilities offered, locations and the area of the space.
However, the future of Colombos real estate market will largely depend on the expected infrastructure developments, which would come due to the proposed Western Region Megapolis Planning Project (WRMPP).
The real estate market in Galle
According to Lamudis in-house Real Estate Market Report of Sri Lanka for 2017, the city of Galle has been recognised as one of the fastest emerging metropolitan regions in the country for luxury properties. Real estate agents in the region have indicated that the demand for such properties seems to be growing at a stable rate for the past few years.
Thanks to its strategic positioning, Galle is currently attracting many foreign investors looking to leverage the Galle Marina and experts believe that many job opportunities can be created through luxury yacht building and marina development. One of the main factors that contributes to the growing real estate industry within the city is its inexplicable value in tourism. Thanks to developments like Weligama Bay Marriott Resort & Spa, Fairway Galle, Amari Galle, Galle Beach Hotel, and infrastructural developments like the Galle Port, the city now offers a myriad variety of property including many short-term rental options.
In comparison to Colombo, property prices are low in Galle. Yet price levels have been increasing since the end of the 30 year civil conflict. Currently, luxury apartments for sale starts at Rs 30 million. While long-term rental prices for luxury villas range from Rs 50,000 - Rs 100,000 per month, monthly rental prices for luxury houses may range from Rs 10,000  Rs 50,000 depending on the facilities included.
Nevertheless, the future of Galle seems to be a greener one. Due to its regional economic growth credits to the tourism industry, Galle may become the location of high-end properties with developments such as Fairway Galle focusing on a more sustainable future.

Oscar Wilde:
GENTLE GIANT of the literary world
Bertrand Russel, Philosopher and writer says English in this modern world would lose its lustre, without the writings of Oscar Wilde. Oscar Wilde was born in 1840 and died in 1900. His works raised eyes brows in the literary and religious worlds of the day. However, he became a golden link in making readers to bow their heads and also to look up in awe to understand the weaknesses of man.
Oscar Wilde was an Irishman. He could be called the pillar in the renaissance of literary Fantasy in English writing. He was a believer in aestheticism. He was flamboyantly attired and was called the man with red carnation. He was Bandusoma. His absolute affinity to lovely features is graphically shows in his story let about Naraissus, a character in Greek mythology who falls in love with his own face. Narcissus would walk up to the river and gaze at his face reflected in the still waters of the river. Narcissus used to caress the flowers on the path to the river. The flowers loved his touch. Narcissus dies. The flowers mourn. The river too is in tears. Why you ask the flowers. He only started at you. Never touched you. yes says the river. He never touched me, But, when he bent down to see his beautiful face reflected on me... into his lovely eyes. Then I saw my own reflection inside his blue eyes. Now I will never be able to see myself.
His writings made many to understand the meaning of a human beings feelings to be made known to the world through the characters and the in-depth yearning of the author to air his feelings. His works are for all time.
Unfortunately the literary world and the church frowned on his De Profondis and Salome where the danced. The church excommunicated him. Later a forgiving church brought him back to the Catholic church, not as Oscar Wilde. He was re-baptized as Sebastian Melmoth, and lived in the USA and England.
Amidst all his eye brow raising stories the literary world is unable to understand how he was going to present to us the immortal story of the Selfish Giant. The story makes us to shed a tear in his name. What was he trying to tell the world
He was sentenced to two years imprisonment with hard labour. His writings were taken off the library bookshelves. The then administration and many so called intellectuals spat on him. He was a homosexual.
Finally he wrote the Selfish Giant. We are unable to understand how an author who shook the world with his stories and unnatural behaviour could ............
Chinua Achebe the African author of When Things Fall Apart, says that the selfish Giant is the most poignant exposure of ones hidden desires and the unthinkable remorse which ends in the author to turn to the faith he believed in. Oscar wilde longs for love where things fail apart. Oscar wild becomes the giant. The wall round the castle becomes his defence  legal and intellectual, when his conscience makes him to yearn to be loved and to be accepted by those who understand the meaning of love, repentance, forgiveness and faith.
The broken wall is his conscience. His accusers become the selfish giant. Encroachers into his garden, conscience abandoned by natures gifts. He is alone. He finds joy in seeing the little children. His other accusers are shown as the winter and frost. The crack in the well is a part of a love seeking conscience. The little children are the bundles of joy.
Oscar Wilde shows to his adversaries that he is accepted by the Prince of Peace when the little boy on the frost coated tree shows him the nail marks of love.
Oscar Wildes selfish giant gives us a tear jerking glimpse of his literary skills what and abruptly due to his life style.
This was in 1900. Today we see governments giving the green light for some sex marriages. Homosexuality is now taken for granted. We look down on this unnatural trait that made God to punish Sodom and Gomorrah according to the Holy Bible. Oscar wilde was jailed in accordance with the laws of the land. His untimely death makes the literary world to shed a tear. Yes, what more stories would have wafted on the world of story writing had he not succumbed into this unnatural habit causing the law and the church to punish him.
The Selfish Giant say some modern writers could be compared to D H Lawrences poem The Snake Lawrence, who rocked the world by his book Lady Chatterleys Lover which caused publishes to print expurgated and unexpurgated editions of the book in conquered by is conscience.
In his poem, the Snake, the author and a snake are near a well. Both are thirsty. A vicious snake. Kill it says his education. No says his conscience. Next, both quench their thirst and go their ways. Happily, conscience makes Lawrence happy. Oscar Wilde, The gentle giant who presented to us many gems in the form stories would have longed to be on a bier covered by a shower of flowers like how the ....... Giant was found by the children. The selfish Giant becomes the unselfish Giant because of his conscience.
Blessed are those who have read these two masterpieces because they make is to delve on our own past, present and maybe the future path of our conscience.

Glittering Porsche show  brings Waters Edge alive
Porsche car show and test drive, an exclusive event organized jointly by the official Porsche car agent in Sri Lanka, Eurocars and Sampath Bank held at Waters Edge showcased sports and SUV models of newest Porsche cars.
The event that focused on premium customers of Sampath Bank offered them the privilege of test-driving Porsche SUV or sports cars to have a feel of the emotional benefits they offer.
Sampath Bank's elite customers are offered with a specially designed lease facility to obtain the Porsche car of their choice while Porsche offering a special discount to this exclusive customer segment.
A range of brand new and re-used Porsche approved vehicles could be obtained by them.
Senura Gunewardene of Porsche Lanka said his company and Sampath Bank having a long standing relationship offered Sampath Bank's premium customers the opportunity to feel the difference of driving a Porsche car.
From early 1940s Porsche focused on building a vehicle that other manufacturers couldn't do. The Sports concept is induced and transferred to all Porsche cars making them unique in appearance and function. Porsche Iconic 9 model that could accelerate from zero to 100 in just 2.8 seconds has a rear engine that offers rear wheel drive or four wheel drive options. The iconic sports car was the central theme of Porsche's 50th anniversary in 2013, he said.
He added, Porsche cars have the essence of sports much more embodied in them, being light weight, powerful and precise. Behind the wheel of a Porsche, the driver feels the exact directness from the road all the way to his hands.
They are faster, much more precise and give the best driving pleasure and experience. The emotional benefit of driving a Porsche is enormous.
Porsche was able to enhance the older concepts of its cars while making it viable for the current market and the current conditions. Its 911 remains so close to its very first iteration in 1963.
Porsche name has become synonymous with sports cars and racecars because that is what company founders Ferdinand Porsche and his son Ferdinand set out to build when they first set up shop with 200 workers in 1948.
Porsche appeals to the emotional benefit that comes from owning one of its lavish vehicles.
Hence Porsche is a brand that is carefully managed for decades to be associated with emotions.

## Title: The Hathurusingha factor

The Hathurusingha factor
Last week the local cricket world was all abuzz that Chandika Hathurusingha had resigned as head coach of the Bangladesh cricket team well ahead of his contract which was till the 2019 World Cup. With Sri Lanka head hunting for a suitable head coach following the resignation of Graham Ford at the end of the Champions Trophy in June, Hathurusinghas resignation sparked off a reaction that he would be roped in by Sri Lanka.
After all why not Hathurusingha is a former Sri Lanka cricketer having represented his country in international cricket first as an opening batsman and then as a useful all-rounder from 1991-1999. After he quit first-class cricket in 2005 he focused on a career as coach that was to earn him a reputation far bigger than what he achieved as a cricketer. Initially he coached the UAE and was then the Sri Lanka A team coach during which period he showed his rare talent for identifying future cricketers.
At the end of Sri Lanka As tour to South Africa in 2008 Hathurusingha picked three potential players for the future - allrounder Angelo Mathews, fast bowler Suranga Lakmal and opener Tharanga Paranavitana.
What is so unique about them is that they are intelligent, pick things up very quickly, and they are quite matured for their age. They seek information and absorb it very quickly. They should go a long way, Hathurusingha said at that time.
True to his words all three of them made it to the Sri Lanka team and in fact two of them Mathews and Lakmal are still around while Paranavitanas 32-Test career ended in 2012.
Hathurusinghas ambition was to become one of Sri Lankas leading cricket coaches. He was already recognised as one of the most highly qualified coaches in the country at the time having attained ECB Level 3 coaching status, one of the most advanced coaching qualifications in the world, as well as a Level II qualification with Cricket Australia.
Cricket coaching has always been a passion and it also provides me with an opportunity of putting something back into the game I love. This will be my second career in cricket and my ambition is to become one of the leading coaches in the world. I hope that sometime in the future I will be an asset to Sri Lanka once again, Hathurusingha said.
In 2009 Hathurusingha was appointed shadow coach as understudy to head coach Trevor Bayliss and assistant coach Stuart Law with the intention of grooming him as a future head coach of Sri Lanka. However things didnt work out the way it was planned. The following year Hathurusingha fell foul of the DS de Silva interim cricket administration who found him guilty of breaching discipline and expelled him.
During that period Hathurusingha played an integral part in the players development. Although he was asked by Bayliss to look after the batting, plan for the opposition and formulate game plans, he also played a big role in the players mental make-up which made them become successful cricketers at international level. A classic example was how Hathurusingha converted the obdurate Thilan Samaraweera into a stroke-maker so that he ended up being chosen to play in the 2011 World Cup.
Kumar Sangakkara, the Sri Lanka captain, at the time personally wrote to SLC requesting a lenient punishment for Hathurusingha considering his value to the team especially ahead of the 2011 World Cup. However the De Silva administration was adamant on their decision which resulted in Hathurusingha leaving Sri Lanka in acrimonious circumstances and taking off to Australia with his family.
Going Down Under turned out to be a blessing in disguise for Hathurusingha as he settled down there and applied for permanent residency. He was appointed as the assistant coach of the New South Wales (NSW) side on a two-year contract but received an upgrade midway through the 2012-13 season when he took over as acting head coach following Anthony Stuarts dismissal. He once again served as deputy to Trevor Bayliss who was then head coach of NSW for 2013-14 but there was something better on the horizon for Hathurusingha as he was named coach of the Sydney Thunder franchise for the 2013 Big Bash League.
Hahurusingha is credited as the architect behind Bangladeshs cricket transformation having worked wonders with the team since his appointment in May 2014, inspiring the players to put in their best foot forward every time they stepped out in the middle. He transformed Bangladeshs approach to the game at all levels. The players have shown more confidence in themselves and the results have shown on the pitch as well with numbers backing his work, making him the most successful coach in Bangladesh history particularly in ODI cricket.
Till Hathurusingha took over Bangladesh had a success rate of 29 percent in ODIs  winning 83 and losing 200 of their 283 matches played till April 2014. The figures after that show a success rate of 50 percent with 24 wins out of 51 matches. Whilst transforming Bangladesh crickets fortunes on the pitch, Hathurusingha has also been making changes behind the scenes as well, calling for and implementing a professional approach to the way the game in Bangladesh should be run. In addition to the head coachs role, Hathurusingha is also a selector and he also has a big say in the appointment of his support staff.
Hathurusingha is known as someone who wants to have absolute freedom in his work and that has at times led to some behind the scenes altercation with the Bangladesh cricket hierarchy but the fact that they extended his contract till the 2019 World Cup proved how much they valued his services.
But now this bombshell of Hathurusingha resigning from Bangladesh well ahead of his contract has sparked off rumours that he is headed for Sri Lanka where he will be gladly accepted. The appointment of Thilan Samaraweera as the Sri Lanka teams batting coach till the 2019 World Cup certainly points out to laying the red carpet for Hathurusinghas return. It was Hathurusingha who got Samaraweera as consultant batting coach for Bangladesh.
Despite his past unpleasant experiences with SLC, Hathurusingha has time and again spoken of a desire to take over as Sri Lankan head coach. I will absolutely come [if SLC asks me to]. I am in this position today because of all the things I learned playing cricket in Sri Lanka. After I learned everything in Sri Lanka for about 20 years, I went to Australia and learned things there as well. But if Sri Lanka invites me at any time, I will happily come back to do something for the country, he said.
While most of the modern-day coaches walk into their posts on their pedigree as a player of international repute, Hathurusingha is someone who has worked hard on his coaching qualifications to make the way up and is, in fact, one of the most highly qualified coaches today.
Knowing Hathurusingha he is not going to come without laying down his own terms. SLC should be mindful of that before signing him on. He may expect the same freedom given to him by the Bangladesh Cricket Board and he wouldnt stand for any interference from the SLC hierarchy. If the SLC has learnt its lessons from the recent past then the signing of Hathurusingha will be the shot in the arm the countrys ailing national team needs.

Higher benefits for Security Forces
Members of the Security Forces will be offered higher benefits and dividends soon, according to a decision taken by President Maithripala Sirisena to look after their interests, recently.
These benefits and dividends would be provided to the security forces personnel after obtaining Cabinet approval, a release by the Presidential Secretariat said.
Accordingly, monthly salaries and other allowances paid to war heroes who died or were disabled in action in operational areas, will be extended to those who died or were disabled in action in non-operational areas as well. When the service pension of war heroes who have left the service due to disability is amended as 85 percent, they will be provided with the disability pension denied to them.
Another proposal is to restore the pension bonus to officers and other ranks who had retired or left after less than 10 to 12 years service after being disabled due to the war. The other benefit proposed is to restore membership in the pension scheme to members of volunteer forces who had retired or died without being able to state their preference to obtain membership in the widows and orphans pension fund.
Apart from this, the government after assuming office had taken steps to offer more benefits to security forces personnel.
These include the increase of the consolidated salary in five stages with effect from 01.01.2016, provision of the Rs. 15,000 allowance paid to executive grade public servants to senior security forces personnel above the Lieutenant Colonel rank and the provision of the Rs. 15,000 professional allowance to legal officers in the security service.
Similarly, members disabled in the war who had retired without monthly salaries and allowances after completing 5-12 and 20 to 22 years service due to less than 50 percent disability, have been given an opportunity to go before a medical board once again and those whose disability was above 20 percent had been given monthly salaries and allowances.
Approval had been granted since 5.1.2017 to pay them arrears of pay and allowances with effect from the date of retirement or leaving service. Rs 6.3 billion have been allocated for the payment of these arrears.
Steps have also been taken to restore service pension rights to officers and other ranks who had retired or left the service with less than 10 to 12 years service after being disabled due to the war. Approval has been given to pay their pensions from 11.11.2016 with effect from 17.12.2014.
Approval has also been given from 01.01.2017 to make the 85 percent pension paid to spouses of deceased war heroes and war heroes who had left the service on medical grounds due to disability in the war as 100 percent by paying them the balance 15 percent as the Ranaviru Care allowance until the death of the beneficiary.
Steps have also been taken to pay a bigger pension with effect from 01.07.2015 to the security forces personnel who retired before 01.01.2006 by amending their pension according to the 6/2006 (iv) salary code.

HNB Group posts Rs 16.8 bn PBT
Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB) continued its growth momentum to post a group profit before VAT & NBT of Rs 20.7 Bn while the PBT and PAT improved to Rs 16.8 Bn and Rs 11.8 Bn respectively for the first nine months of the year while group assets crossed Rs 1 Tn.
PBT at Bank level surpassed Rs 15 Bn and PAT was recorded at Rs 10.9 Bn.
Interest income of the Bank grew by 33.5% year on year (yoy), supported by a 14.9% yoy growth in advances. The 14.9% yoy growth in current account and savings account (CASA) deposits to Rs. 247.2 Bn, enabled to improve the net interest income of the Bank by 18.7% yoy to Rs 29.6 Bn.
The interest income was complimented by fee and commission income which grew by 20.4% yoy on a net basis, adding Rs 6.1 Bn to the Banks topline. Credit card business, trade finance and guarantee commission continued to be key contributors towards this growth.
An increase in swap rates as well as the volume of swaps led to the trading loss increasing to Rs. 2.8 Bn during the first nine months of 2017 compared to the loss of Rs 1.3 Bn in the corresponding period of the previous year.
The initiatives adopted in the recent years towards operational excellence continued to bear fruit with HNB being able to contain the increase in total operating expenses to 7.5% yoy.
The upward revision in VAT to 15% from 11% in 2016, led to an increase of 29.6% in VAT & NBT charges for the period.
This resulted in the Banks PBT growth being constrained to 6.3%, leading to a PBT of Rs 15.4 Bn for the period.
Commenting on the performance, MD/CEO of HNB, Jonathan Alles said, HNB continues to deliver sound performance, notwithstanding the challenging conditions. We are humbled by the prestigious local and international accolades and are truly grateful to our stakeholders for their unstinted patronage.

India to clarify stand on Ram Sethu in six weeks
The Indian Supreme Court granted six weeks to the Centre to clarify its stand on the mythical Ram Sethu, a chain of limestone shoals between Indian and Sri Lankan coasts, on Monday.
A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A. M. Khanwilkar and D. Y. Chandrachud asked the Centre to file its reply in six weeks on a plea filed by BJP leader Subramanian Swamy.
Also known as the Adam's bridge, the Ram Sethu is a chain of limestone shoals between Pamban or Rameswaram Island off the south-eastern coast of Tamil Nadu, and Mannar Island on the north-western coast of Sri Lanka.Swamy said the Indian government had already made its stand clear in the Indian Parliament that they are not going to touch the Ram Sethu.
Additional Solicitor General Pinky Anand, appearing for the Centre, sought time to file the reply affidavit.
The apex court granted liberty to Swamy to approach the Court if the response of the Centre is not filed.The BJP leader, during earlier hearings, had submitted that the Centre has made a statement on the floor of Parliament that it has no intention whatsoever to tamper with the 'bridge.'
On November 26, 2015, the Apex Court had granted four weeks to the Centre to file its response on Swamy's plea that he wanted to withdraw his 2009 petition against the Sethusamudram project as the Indian government had decided that the mythological bridge would not be dismantled. - DNA India

Intimate peek into the royals
Now in their 90s  though with the mental alertness and physical fitness of a couple many years younger  the Queen and Prince Philip are in uncharted waters.
As they prepare to celebrate their 70th wedding anniversary on November 20, they know they have rewritten the record books. The 91-year-old Queen is now the longest reigning British monarch in history, and her husband is the oldest-ever male member of the Royal Family.
At the age of 96, Philip finally retired from royal duties in August. Shortly after his decision was announced, 88-year-old mathematician Michael Atiyah said to him at a lunch: 'I'm sorry to hear you're standing down.'
According to the couturier who made the outfit the Queen wore to Prince Andrew's wedding in 1986, she blushed when it prompted a rare compliment from her husband of nearly 40 years
'Well, I can't stand up much longer,' said the Prince. It was the type of dry and humorous response we've learned to expect from Philip.
Indeed, he and the Queen have been part of our lives for so long that we imagine we know them. But do we really
After many years of writing about the Royal Family  I've met both the Queen and Philip on many occasions  I feel I've had a unique insight into their lives: and what I've discovered is that there's a great deal more to them than their popular image suggests.
In public, for instance, the Queen is often unsmiling; it's as if her royal duties, which she's always undertaken with the utmost gravity and dedication, preclude her ever seeing the lighter side of life. In private, however, she can be quite different.
Top dogs: When the Queen is at one of her estates, her cogis go, too - with fillet steak and chicken breast on the menu
Both the Queen and Prince Philip are very attached to their staff, who are like an extended part of the family. And they often take a sympathetic attitude to them when they land in trouble.
On one occasion, Philip noticed that a certain footman had been missing for a few days and asked his page where he had got to. 'He was sacked, Sir,' the page informed him.
Philip wanted to know what the man had done to deserve to be fired.
'I am afraid they found him in bed with one of the housemaids, Sir,' the page replied. 'And they sacked him' the Duke said, outraged. 'They should have given him a medal!'
Unexpectedly, she has a well-developed sense of humour. This surfaced during an early trip to America, when she hilariously mimicked the U.S. photographers who were ever-present.
Deciding to do some filming of her own, she pointed her camera at Philip and cried out in a nasal American voice: 'Hey! You there! Hey, Dook! Look this way a sec! Dat's it! Thanks a lot!'
In her old age, she still relies on humour to leaven potentially serious situations. On the weekend of her Diamond Jubilee, when Philip was taken into hospital as a precautionary measure for a bladder infection, she was heard to quip: 'Don't die on me. Not now, anyway!'
Surprisingly, too, it was the Queen who was keenest on doing the rather undignified stunt that was filmed for the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games.
This involved her appearing in her first acting role  as a Bond girl opposite 007 star Daniel Craig  at Buckingham Palace, and then seeming to parachute into the Olympic stadium. Philip was extremely dubious about the whole thing. Needless to say, however, she wouldn't have done it if he hadn't eventually given his approval.
His own wry and sometimes ribald sense of humour has been a crucial factor in the marriage. From the very start, he's always been able to make his wife laugh. In the Fifties, the young Queen would freeze before TV cameras, but he'd diffuse the tension with an amusing aside to bring a smile to her face.
When you're under a constant spotlight, as she has been for almost her entire life, this makes a vital difference.
Having come from a sheltered background, the Queen was still painfully shy in her 20s. During her first Commonwealth tour of Australia in 1954, there were times when it all became overwhelming.
At 28, she'd been Queen for only two years and the responsibility still terrified and confused her.
But with Philip at her side, she felt she'd always be able to cope.He made her see the funny side of situations, and he was often the only person she could talk to in a superficial vein about what they'd seen and done; she didn't have to be on her guard with him, worrying in case she might say the wrong thing or create the wrong impression.
Haven't we met before The Queen breaks out in a smile after walking past Prince Philip dressed in full uniform, including a bearskin, at Buckingham Palace in 2005
He gave her some much-needed courage when she was meeting the hundreds of people who were waiting for her.
Occasionally, Philip's sense of the ridiculous has led to one of his famous gaffes  risky remarks that he makes partly to liven things up, get a reaction or because he's bored stiff.
One of the chief reasons for these so-called gaffes is less well understood: he simply wants to make the Queen laugh.
Better than anyone, Philip knows that she never really conquered her shyness. She may have met more strangers in her life than almost anyone else on the planet, but her conversational skills remain minimal.
It's usually only with people who are interested in racing or breeding thoroughbred horses that she can be animated and chatty.

Iran pledges swift aid after quake kills 400
IRAN: Thousands of homeless Iranians sought shelter from bitter cold on Tuesday as President Hassan Rouhani promised swift help after a major earthquake that killed more than 400 people.
The country marked a day of mourning for those killed in the 7.3-magnitude quake that struck a mountainous region spanning the Iran-Iraq border late Sunday.
Thousands of homes were destroyed in the quake, which rocked a region spanning Irans western province of Kermanshah and neighbouring Iraqi Kurdistan.
On Tuesday, residents who had fled their homes awoke from a second night in the cold outdoors as authorities struggled to get aid into the quake zone.
Rouhani visited the city of Kermanshah and promised the government would move swiftly to help those left homeless by the disaster.
I want to assure those who are suffering that the government has begun to act with all means at its disposal and is scrambling to resolve this problem as quickly as possible, he said.
Rouhani said all aid would be channelled through the Housing Foundation, one of the charitable trusts set up after the Islamic revolution of 1979 that are major players in the Iranian economy.
The head of the elite Revolutionary Guards, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, said the immediate need was for tents, water and food.
Newly constructed buildings... held up well, but the old houses built with earth were totally destroyed, he told state television as he visited the affected region.
Around 12,000 Iranian homes were destroyed and another 15,000 damaged in the quake, according to official estimates.
Seven towns and nearly 2,000 villages were damaged, authorities said, and several villages were completely wiped from the map.
The toll in Iran stood at 430 dead and 7,460 injured, while across the border in more sparsely populated areas of Iraq, the health ministry said eight people had died and several hundred were injured. Iraqs Red Crescent put the toll at nine dead. On Tuesday, Iran marked a day of mourning, with a black banner adorning the corner of images of the disaster broadcast by state television to the tune of Sad Lisa by British singer Yusuf Islam, formerly known as Cat Stevens.
The headline of a state newspaper read Iran cries with Kermanshah, referring to the Kurdish-majority province.
Search operations are reaching their end, with teams constantly monitoring the situation to know if there are still people to extract from the rubble, Behnam Saidi, the spokesman for a crisis unit set up to handle the response to the quake, told state television.
But more aid was still needed.
The most urgent need is to provide solutions for heating, housing and food, Pir Hossein Koolivand, the head of national rescue services, told state television.
Today, we sent our ambulances to villages in areas affected by the quake to help people rescued yesterday, including changing their bandages, he said. Rouhani on Tuesday visited the town of Sar-e Pol-e Zahab, worst hit by the quake.
At least 280 people were killed in the town, home to some 85,000 people, where crumpled vehicles lay under the rubble of flattened buildings on the streets.
On Monday, Iranian officials said they were setting up relief camps for the displaced and that 22,000 tents, 52,000 blankets and tonnes of food and water had been distributed.
The official IRNA news agency said 30 Red Crescent teams had been sent to the area.
Hundreds of ambulances and dozens of army helicopters were reported to have joined the rescue effort after supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered the government and armed forces to mobilise all their means. - AFP

JVP opposes Budget proposal to amend certain laws
JVP National Organizer MP Bimal Ratnayake yesterday charged that the governments proposal to amend certain laws aimed to enable foreign capital to swallow up the little funds left over in the local sovereign economy.
He was commenting on the proposals made by Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera in his Budget speech, to amend certain outdated laws.
Addressing the media yesterday, at the JVP Headquarters, MP Rathnayake said the two main political parties have the responsibility of amending any outdated Act and there is no issue with that.
He said proposals to amend nearly 10 Acts has been mentioned in the Budget 2018 under the topic Fast Tracking Liberalization, which means that the government is attempting to fulfill their economic policy of selling all national resources which will badly affect the living standards of ordinary people.
The MP invited the public to rally round to defeat the amendment of certain Acts that directly affect the livelihoods of the people, such as the Customs Ordinance, the Excise Ordinance in 1912, the Education Ordinance in 1939, the Rent Act No. 7 of 1972, Paddy Lands Act No. 1 of 1958 and the Agricultural Lands Act No. 42 of 1973 and the Shop and Office Employees Act.

'Lord Naseby's statement highlights Sri Lanka Army's professionalism'
Information unearthed by Lord Naseby highlights the professional conduct of the Sri Lankan Army during the period of the war, said Foreign Affairs State Minister Wasantha Senanayake.
He reiterated the Governments deep appreciation for Lord Naseby for his continuous and long standing support extended to Sri Lanka.
He made these observations, replying to an adjournment motion moved by the Joint Opposition in Parliament yesterday.
Lord Nasebys statement helped us remove the dark shadow cast on the Sri Lankan Armed Forces for many years since the war ended. This is an achievement for the entire country. I request all MPs in both the Government and Opposition, to individually write to Lord Naseby to thank him. This is a great opportunity for Sri Lanka to negate the wrong impression on our armed forces and we must use it to the fullest, he said.
Replying to MP Gunawardena, Senanayake distanced the Foreign Ministry from the comments Deputy Minister Dr Harsha de Silva said to have been made. The Foreign Ministry recognizes the value of Lord Nasebys statement. I would be surprised if Dr Harsha de Silva had actually made such a statement, but I do not know whether he actually said it or not, said Senanayake.
It was due to short sighted policies that took Sri Lanka to an isolated position in the world. I cannot perceive a threat to this country either with regard to defence forces or its present or former leaders in the light of the excellent relationship Sri Lanka now enjoys with the international community. Certainly, the information unearthed by Lord Naseby must be used by the Government and Opposition parties and all those who consider themselves friends of Sri Lanka to counter the blatant falsehoods that were spread about the country and the war, he added.
The State Minister also read out a letter he sent to Lord Naseby on behalf of the Government, admiring his efforts on behalf of Sri Lanka.
In the letter I thanked Lord Naseby for his invaluable work and said that the information made public by Lord Naseby makes it clear that the Sri Lanka armed forces fought a much cleaner war than is often alleged in the international arena, he noted.

Maersk Line backs Budget bid to liberalize  shipping and logistics sector
Maersk Line - the largest container shipping line globally and a market leader in Sri Lanka - fully supports the 2018 Budget proposals made by Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera to open up the shipping and logistics sector to foreign investments and to establish an independent port regulator.
Steve Felder, Managing Director India, Sri Lanka & Bangladesh, for Maersk Line in a statement issued on the subject said,d Maersk Line supports any efforts that governments make to liberalize and improve the business environment for the maritime industry, and for our customers. In this spirit, we commend the proposals tabled in the Sri Lankan Parliament last week, which included removing the restriction on foreign ownership of shipping agencies and amendment of the Merchant Shipping Act, which are intended to further support the development of Colombo as a key maritime hub.
The liberalization of shipping agencies is expected to reduce transaction costs for carriers using Colombo as a transshipment hub thereby making it attractive for shipping lines like Maersk to further increase volumes especially given the growth of new transshipment hubs in this region.
Felder further mentioned that if the proposals tabled in the Parliament last Thursday which included removing the restriction on foreign ownership of shipping agencies, and the amendment of the Merchant Shipping Act, are approved, Maersk will engage closely with its headquarters and its valued partners in Sri Lanka, and together evaluate options on increasing our footprint in Sri Lanka.
Maersk Line, the global containerized division of the Maersk Group has employees in 325 offices across 125 countries and a fleet of more than 500 vessels along with 1.9 million containers, with the global reach and resources to accommodate customers broad transportation needs.

Medical students to re-attend lectures from Nov. 20
The government Medical Faculty undergraduates will re-attend lectures from November 20 as the issue of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) has received satisfactory solutions, Convener of the Medical Faculty Students Action Committee (MFSAC) Ryan Jayalath said yesterday.
Responding to the Daily News, Jayalath said the re-attendance does not mean that they have given up on their battle against the SAITM. Since there were favorable solutions forwarded, he said they decided to cooperate.
However, we are not hundred percent satisfied with the solutions given. This also does not mean that our protests will completely cease. We are waiting until the government implements these proposed solutions soon.
We wont allow them to bid time for a way out from implementing these solutions, Jayalath explained.

Mo Farah  wont rule out Olympic marathon bid
LONDON: Britain's Mo Farah says he could compete in the marathon at the 2020 Olympics if he feels confident of winning a medal.
Farah retired from the track in August to focus on road racing and has been coy about his Olympic future.
The 34-year-old had previously hinted he might not race for Britain again, but Farah hasn't completely ruled out the opportunity of going for gold in Tokyo.
Speaking after receiving his knighthood from the Queen at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday, the four-time Olympic champion said: If I'm capable of getting a medal or close to a medal (in Tokyo), you will see me. He has been retained on British Athletics' World Class Performance Programme despite doubts over his Olympic plans.
But, now living in London after splitting from controversial coach Alberto Salazar, Farah is currently more concerned with winning the London Marathon.
For me it is the biggest marathon in the world, and it is going to be tough. Mo Farah ain't going to turn up and win... it's going to be hard to run, he said.
Quizzed on whether he had taught the Queen to do his famous 'Mobot' celebration, Farah laughed, saying it was far too rude - not in Buckingham Palace.

President at Prof.Gunapala Malalasekara commemorative book launch says
Most diplomats use foreign postings to spend retirement in luxury
President Maithripala Sirisena who was critical of the Foreign Service yesterday said most diplomats use their postings abroad as a means to spend their retirement in luxury.
Foreign diplomatic postings are highly competitive in this country not because they want to work for the country but because they want one long vacation, he added as he addressed the commemorations and book launch of the late Prof Gunapala Piyasena Malalasekara at the BMICH.
Prof. Malalasekara's biography edited and compiled by Prof.Kusuma Karunaratne and W.A.Abeysinghe was presented to the President by Prof Malalasekaras son, Vijaya Malalasekara.
Prof. Malalasekara was Sri Lankas first Ambassador to the Soviet Uniion, High Commissioner to Canada, the United Kingdom and Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York.
He was also Professor Emeritus in Pali and Dean of the Faculty of Oriental Studies at the Colombo University.
Prof.Malasekara who was a renowned academic in Pali and Buddhist Studies also produced the Buddhist Encyclopaedia with his magnum opus being the Malalasekara Sinhala to English Dictionary.
President Sirisena thus asked the present diplomats to take Prof. Malalasekara as an example and work to improve their service to the country,
In the last 25 years, if our diplomats had taken people like Prof. Malalasekara as an example and committed themselves to their work and improved their knowledge and understanding, our country would have gone far. We would have developed much more and benefitted much more with the improved relations with the international community, the President said.
As a teacher, lecturer, diplomat and an expert in Buddhist Philosophy, he won the world for his motherland and introduced his country to the world, President Sirisena said.
The President recalled that Prof. Malalasekaras 1950s, was a decade where Sri Lanka greatly expanded its presence in the international sphere. It was a time where many of the pioneering work in bilateral talks, opening of embassies, government to government relationships, economic, technological and educational agreements were signed and built.
When you look at the power blocks at the time, on one side we had the Communist countries aligned with the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, the USA with other Capitalist countries. During this Cold War period, our country, under Prime Minister Bandaranaike chose to follow and introduce the policy of non-alignment. The policy was a major factor which led to the country building relations outside of power blocks and to be friends with all. Prof Malalasekara contributed greatly to this endeavour along with Prime Minister Bandaranaike, President Sirisena said.
On a personal note, the President recalled meeting Prof.Malalasekara at a conference of the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress in the mid 1960s.
President Sirisena who was heading a branch of the student wing of the Congress at his school in Polonnaruwa Maha Vidyalaya attended its conference as a 15-year-old.
Special Assignments Minister Dr.Sarath Amunugama who delivered the key note address at the event noted that Prof. Malalasekara was a public intellectual who did not keep his intellect hidden within the four walls of a university but chose to engage in public life and to enrich it with his studies.
As an expert in both English and Sinhala, Prof.Malalasekara also stressed the importance of the study of English whilst knowing ones mother tongue, added Dr.Amunugama and this he said allowed Prof. Malalasekara to take Buddhism to the world and to enrich its education.

Nadal pulls out of ATP Finals after Goffin defeat
London: Rafael Nadal pulled out of the ATP Finals on Monday, admitting he had lost his fitness battle after crashing to defeat in three sets to David Goffin in a thrilling encounter.
The world number one dug deep but was stunned 7-6 (7/5), 6-7 (4/7), 6-4 by Goffin in his opening match of the end-of-season finale, which he has never won in his illustrious career.
The Spaniard came into the tournament with doubts swirling over his fitness after pulling out of the Paris Masters with a knee injury.
Initially he showed no obvious ill-effects during a rollercoaster round-robin encounter in front of a supportive crowd but eventually his injury caught up with him and forced him to admit his season is over.
No, I am off, said Nadal. My season is finished. Yeah, I had the commitment with the event, with the city, with myself. I tried hard. I did the thing that I had to do to try to be ready to play. But I am really not ready to play.
Is about the pain, he added. I cannot hold with enough power to keep playing. I tried, but seriously it was a miracle to be very close in the score during the match. It really doesnt make sense.
Nadal said he would work hard to be ready for the start of the next season.
I know what I have to do, he said. I know all the things that happened in the past when I had these things, and I know the treatment that I had to do. I know the periods of time that I need to work. Then if the treatment works or not, we will see.
Nadal, 31, struggled to find his range early in front of a raucous crowd rooting for him and was broken twice in the first set by the Belgian seventh seed, who had lost their previous two encounters.
The Spaniard appeared to have earned a psychological edge when Goffin double-faulted while serving for the set and the match went into a tie-break but the Belgian re-found his focus to come out on top.
The second set went with serve until the eighth game, when Goffin broke to earn a chance to serve for the match, only for Nadal to break back.
Goffin had a golden chance to seal the match in Nadals next service game but failed to put away a mid-court forehand on match point and the left-hander levelled at 5-5.
The Belgian composed himself to hold and then earned three more match points but Nadal, showing incredible grit and playing right at the limit, saved all three to take it to another tie-break, which he won.
In the decider, Nadal appeared to feel discomfort in his right knee as he went two breaks down but still he refused to admit defeat, recovering a break before eventually succumbing.
It was a tough fight until the end, said a relieved Goffin.
Rafa is one of the strongest players mentally on the tour. I am so happy to finally find the key to win this match. It is so special to do it here.
Nadal has won 75 singles titles in his illustrious career, including 16 Grand Slams and 30 Masters events but he has yet to triumph at the ATP Finals, played on quick indoor courts rather than his favoured clay.
Earlier, also in the Pete Sampras group, Grigor Dimitrov held his nerve to beat Dominic Thiem 6-3, 5-7, 7-5.
The elegant Bulgarian had the edge for most of an enthralling contest of one-handed backhands but admitted he felt pretty nervous in his first appearance at the ATP Finals.
The sixth seed, who has enjoyed the best season of his career, looked wobbly as he blew his chance to serve for the match at 5-4 in the decider only to hit back immediately as Thiem himself faltered and going on to seal victory on his third match point.
The ATP Finals feature the top eight fit male singles players and doubles teams that have accrued the most points throughout the 2017 season.

There are many divisions among men. These divisions have reasons justifiable as well as unjustifiable. The men enjoy various divisions in ethnicity, religion and caste. However, all the men are similar in nudity. Likewise, compassion rises only following a nude understanding. Any act done without that nude understanding is nothing but a cheat.
But men chose not to reach the nude understanding because of a special reason.
It is simply because they are blind on visual art. Only a few men manage to escape from this visual art blindness.

National Export Strategy for Sri Lanka  - prerequisite for economic development
Sri Lankas economy needs to transform itself to ensure that the nations aspirations to reach higher middle income status by the year 2020 are met and achieved. This transformation can take place by introducing innovative and radical changes to Sri Lankas current economic development model.
Sri Lankas economic growth, which is dependent on exports, requires continued structural changes aimed at greater diversification, innovation, productivity increases. As per President Maithripala Sirisenas statement at the 45th Annual Session of the International Pepper Community held at the Earls Regency, Kandy, it is also required to have a dynamic plan to increase agricultural exports, while endorsing quantitative and qualitative standards of the agricultural crops. In addition, the development of services, in particular, a dynamic and modern information technology sector will contribute significantly to economic growth and prosperity.
The National Export Strategy (NES) has been developed by private and public stakeholders through extensive consultations which commenced from the First National Symposium held in April 2017 at Temple Trees, under the patronage of the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
During these consultations, a strategic vision for Sri Lankas export growth was developed: Sri Lanka  An Export Hub driven by Innovation and Investment.
Six priority sectors and four trade support functions (TSF) were identified by the private and public stakeholders at the consultations. These focus on diversification through support to the priority sectors which are ICT, Wellness Tourism, Spice Concentrates, Boat Building, Processed Food and Beverages, and Electronic, Electrical and Machinery.
All export sectors including the mature sectors will benefit from the strengthening of trade support functions. These TSFs include National Quality Infrastructure, Innovation and R&D, Logistics and Trade Promotion. The NES for Sri Lanka is being designed by the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade and the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) in consultation with private and public stakeholders.
Technical Assistance to develop the NES is provided by the International Trade Centre (ITC) through funding by the European Union (EU); this technical assistance will aid Sri Lankas economic vision of strengthening the export competitiveness of the private sector to accomplish inclusive and sustainable growth.
The consultative process leads public sector institutions and private sector enterprises to design a common and agreed plan for growing and diversifying Sri Lankas export products and reaching new target destinations. Moreover, the focus on some of these sectors will help to invigorate rural economies and create many new employment opportunities. This is part of the Sri Lankan government's drive to achieve a target of US$ 20 billion in exports revenue by 2020.
These priority sectors, chosen by stakeholders, were selected on the basis that focus on these sectors may have the optimal desired impact on the Sri Lankan export economy. Sri Lankan markets will benefit significantly from foreign investment and these sectors were identified as having the greatest potential in the next five years to attract foreign investment.
This has the potential to lead to setting up of international partnerships to benefit local markets and make the most of the current Free Trade Agreements already in place. In relation to each sector, one of the main objectives of the consultations was to seek answers to three questions; the Current status; Future goals; and, Steps or actions to reach the destination. Answers to these questions are expected to help strengthen these sectors and contribute to innovative export led growth.
The second round of Consultative Meetings were held from July 12-20, 2017 to define roadmaps for expanding exports and analyse performances of value chains for the NES focus sectors, market orientations, challenges and opportunities.
The Trade Support Functions groups identified the main challenges in the provision of quality and affordable trade support services to Sri Lanka exporters. Subsequently, regional and sector specific public and private stakeholder consultations were conducted, to confirm trade diagnostics, value chain performances, market orientation and strategic issues, with the ultimate objective to design strategies to improve industry performance.
Two rounds of sector consultations for each individual sector were conducted at the EDB, from August 8 to September 8, 2017. Regional consultations were held in the Central, Northern and Southern Provinces from September 18-22, 2017, to engage regional stakeholders and to ensure that regional concerns, requirements and specificities are fully integrated in strategic decision making.
The overview of the strategy design process and the reviewing and validation of the initial results were done at the third consultation which took place from October 10-12, 2017.
Based on the NES vision and strategic objectives, a list of high priority export development interventions was identified for integration in the November 2018 National Budget. The successful implementation of Sri Lankas National Export Strategy depends on the capacity and willingness of all public and private sector stakeholders to contribute, collaborate, own and drive towards a common national objective. Priorities need to be implemented at the earliest possible opportunity and the frequency of regular and structured public-private dialogues will be critical to maintain the momentum needed.

OHCHR to take up SL under Universal Periodic Review
Sri Lanka's report under the Universal Periodic Review will come up for consideration by the OHCHR Working Group on UPR today, in Geneva.
The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) was established by the General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) in 2006, as a process through which the human rights record of every UN Member State is peer-reviewed.
This review, conducted through the UN Human Rights Council (HRC), is based upon each countrys human rights obligations and commitments in the UN Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, human rights instruments to which the country is a party, and other sources. During the process, the country under review submits a written report on its human rights record and appears before the Council, where it receives recommendations regarding its human rights record from the other UN Member States.
The country under review is able to accept or note these recommendations. Those accepted form the basis for future reporting, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement.
The UPR is the only process through which all UN Member States undergo review and scrutiny of their human rights records. Sri Lanka underwent its first UPR cycle in 2008 and the second in 2012. The review that will be conducted today will be Sri Lankas third, and along with Sri Lanka, the following countries will also be reviewed under the UPRs third cycle at the 28th Working Group, during the period November 6-17: Argentina, Benin, Czechia, Gabon, Ghana, Guatemala, Japan, Pakistan, Peru, Republic of Korea, Switzerland, Ukraine, and Zambia.
Keeping with the National Unity Governments firm commitment to protect, promote and uphold the human rights of all citizens of Sri Lanka as national policy, the Sri Lankas delegation to the review will be led by National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva.
The delegation will comprise officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Attorney-Generals Department, the Presidents Office, and the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the UN in Geneva, the Foreign Affairs Ministry in a statement said.
The National Report of Sri Lanka covers areas that were part of the recommendations accepted by Sri Lanka following the 2nd UPR in 2012. The National Report was drafted, following wide consultations with all stakeholders including public consultations in Colombo, Kandy, Galle, Jaffna, and Kalmunai, online consultations and consultations by post.
Sri Lanka will continue to engage constructively with the UN Human Rights Council and all member states of the UN to promote and protect human rights locally and internationally, the Foreign Affairs Ministry stated.

Our chances  of winning  a Test match  in India are slim,  says Muralitharan
Sri Lanka have little chance of winning even one Test match against India in the upcoming three-match series that begins on Thursday in Kolkata. This is the opinion of worlds most successful spinner Muthiah Muralitharan. Sri Lanka have played 17 Tests in India but have not won a single game so far.
Our chances of winning a Test match in India, I would say, are slim. All teams have struggled to compete in India. In the last 13 years, only two teams have won a series in India. They are ranked number one in the world at the moment, our Test cricket seems to be doing okay, but we are struggling in shorter formats of the game. This will be a tough series and the characters of our boys will be tested, Muralitharan said.
Muralitharan said that when he toured India during his playing days in 1994 to 2009, he had to face worlds best batting line-up. He also failed to win a single Test with his team on four tours.
When I played against India, they had the worlds best batting line-up. Their batting was stronger than now I would say. If you take that batting line-up, they had (Virender) Sehwag, (Gautam) Gambhir, (Rahul) Dravid, (Sachin) Tendulkar, (Sourav) Ganguly, (VVS) Laxman and (MS) Dhoni batting from one to seven. Some of them are all-time greats of the sport and it was a tough task for us, Muralitharan recalled.
Similarly, we too were quite strong at home. Despite such a good side, India failed to win a series in Sri Lanka for some 22 years. We have some happy memories having made things tougher for them. It has been a superb rivalry and some closely contested games. Thats what the sport wants. There were some series where all games were drawn. In 1997, we played five Tests, two at home and three away and all games were drawn. Both teams had some quality batsmen.  Indian Express

Over 2.5 mn in Sri Lanka need housing - Minister
There are 2.5 million people in Sri Lanka who are in need of housing according to Housing and Development Minister Sajith Premadasa.
When I took over the Ministry in 2015, they did not have accurate statistics on the housing requirement of the country. The ministry was simply adding 50,000 every year as an estimate to the survey conducted by the Census and Statistics Department every decade, Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
He was addressing a function held at Temple Trees on Monday (13) to hand over housing deeds and loans to low income families in the Colombo District under the Semata Sevana (A Shelter for All) programme.
Around 2,372 families in the Colombo District received title deeds to houses, certificates of ownership, lease deeds, loans under the Sonduru Piyasa programme, agreements of sale and housing loans for those who lost their homes in Salawa and Kosgama due to the Salawa armoury explosion. The latter had 825 families receiving housing loans. A total of Rs 260 million was handed over to these families through these programmes.
The Minister further explained that in the last year, the Ministry together with all local government officials conducted a survey to assess the exact housing figures in the country.
The Semata Sevana program aims to meet the housing needs in the country by 2025.
According to the Minister, the 2017 Budget allocated Rs 6 billion to the Ministry and the 2018 Budget has increased this to over Rs 10 billion. Premadasa asserted that the Ministry has spent close to 90 percent of their budgetary allocations thus far.
The Ministry also aims to complete 500 model villages this year with 2500 being the target by the end of 2020.

PAFFREL seeks each MP's dual citizenship status
The Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi has requested the Speaker to obtain an affidavit from each and every Parliamentarian to confirm that they were not holding dual citizenships.
The PAFFREL made this request from Speaker Karu Jayasuriya on the heels of the Supreme Court ruling disqualifying Geetha Kumarasinghe from holding a Parliamentary seat on the grounds that she was a dual citizen of Sri Lanka and Switzerland.
In a letter to the Speaker last week, Hettiarachchi pointed out that if any MP concealed his or her dual citizenship, he or she was cheating the public. Hettiarachchi previously lodged an RTI request at the Emigration and Immigration Department querying the citizenship status of MPs. The Department replied that only former MP Kumarasinghe held a dual citizenship as per the records available with it. We are unable to be satisfied with this reply as it does not give a concrete and clear idea on those who had not revealed dual citizenship they possess. The law makers should not break the countrys law by concealing their citizenship status. In order to clear any doubts and to protect the dignity of MPs, we request you to obtain an affidavit from each and every MP stating that they do not hold dual citizenship, Hettiarachchi said in his letter to the Speaker.
With former MP Kumarasinghes court case, a public dialogue was created on public representatives and officials holding dual citizenship.
Their integrity and conflict of interests were questioned. The Supreme Court ruling on Kumarasinghes appeal was a historical judgement that marks a turning point in Sri Lankan political culture, the letter further said.

Pakistans Saeed Ajmal retires from all cricket
Karachi: Pakistan spinner Saeed Ajmal announced his retirement from all forms of cricket on Monday, two years after losing his wicket-taking bite with a remodelled bowling action that was twice deemed illegal.
During a successful but controversial career, Ajmal was once celebrated as the worlds number one bowler in one day internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 cricket, and was almost as successful in Tests.
He famously captured 24 wickets in three Tests against England in 2012.
But his time in the limelight was cut short after a temporary ban for chucking saw him return to the sport in 2015 without the same form.
He took just one wicket in two ODIs and a Twenty20 in Bangladesh, his first matches after being cleared to bowl, and was never selected for the national team again.
I am quitting all forms of cricket after the current National Twenty20 tournament, Ajmal told AFP from Rawalpindi on the phone.
It was a highly satisfying career in which I achieved whatever goals I set for myself and helped the team win matches.
Ajmal took 178 wickets in 35 Tests, the last of which was at Galle in Sri Lanka in 2014, where his bowling action was reported for a second time. It was first reported during an ODI series against Australia in the UAE in 2009.
He finished with 184 wickets in 113 ODIs, and 85 in 64 Twenty20 internationals.
But in spite of his early successes, Ajmal said the last two years of his career had been frustrating.
Ban over action left me frustrated and hurt, he said. More hurtful was that current player Stuart Broad questioned that and his comments hurt me no end. But I have forgiven everyone.
England fast bowler Broad questioned the legality of Ajmals action when the Pakistani spinner was featuring in an English county championship a month before the umpires report in Sri Lanka.
Ajmal took a swipe at the process of calling bowlers out for illegal action.
It seems that the process was meant for me and (Mohammad) Hafeez, all other bowlers with questionable actions are still playing, he said. Hafeezs action was reported for a second time last month.
Ajmal said he will concentrate on coaching in the future.

Naseby says tri-forces fought terrorism, not Tamils:Dinesh
The Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday, called on the Government to pursue British Parliamentarian Lord Nasebys speech at the House of Lords with the International Community to counter war crimes allegations against Sri Lanka. Moving an Adjournment Motion in Parliament, the MP stressed that it was the duty of the Government to place Nasebys statement before the UN Human Rights Council and re-canvass the Resolution against Sri Lanka.
Quoting sections of Nasebys statement at the UK Parliament in October, the MP pointed out that Naseby had successfully pointed out that the 40,000 civilian deaths in the Darusman Report was a total fabrication, while the real figure was much less than 7,000.
Naseby had convincingly proven that our tri-forces fought a war against terrorism and that it was not against the Tamil people. He had appealed to the West and in particular, the US and UK, to remove the threat of war crimes and foreign judges that overhangs and overshadows all Sri Lankans and their leaders. Why is the Government silent about this statement Why not take the lead from Naseby and pursue this matter with Britains Foreign and Commonwealth Office and with the UN Human Rights Council to change their unjust positions with regard to Sri Lanka he questioned.
MP Gunawardena also criticized Deputy Minister Dr Harsha de Silva, stating that the latter had said that Lord Nasebys statement had no relevance in the current affairs in Geneva. Dr de Silva had already left for Geneva to represent Sri Lanka at the UPR session. He uttered that Nasebys statement had no relevance. That is a total let down of the country. I hope Deputy Foreign Minister Wasantha Senanayake would take this message to the President to intervene in this situation even at this late moment, he said.
JO MP Sisira Jayakody seconded the motion.
Budget has created an entrepreneurial culture:State Minister Abeywardena
A salient feature in this Budget is that it has created a background to establish an entrepreneurial culture in the country, said Enterprise Development State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena.
He said so, joining the Second Reading debate of the Appropriation Bill 2018 in Parliament yesterday.
This budget has included realistic goals without condemning the past nor dreaming of the future. The world economy does not allow for large scale relief measures. The world economic development is currently at 2%. Even though oil prices have reduced globally, the purchase of goods had declined and the world purchasing power had reduced, he said.
Abeywardena pointed out that a budget should include a long term vision rather than a short term vision. Entrepreneurship based on economies in the world have succeeded and developed, he said, pointing out that debt has become a long term burden of the country. If the State income is not at least 20%, then it is hard to manage the economy, but he said during the past two years there had been a growth of 41%.
He said the world does not accept that the problem could be resolved by merely expanding State sectors. The most salient feature expected in this budget was to prepare the backdrop for the creation of an entrepreneurial culture. Malaysia, China and Korea are countries that have prospered as they had uplifted entrepreneurship. It is not possible to manage the economy by merely increasing State income without properly managing its expenditure. We should look at how Singapore had progressed through the exchange economy. Their culture was not destroyed by their open economy. Neither was their security compromised. State income and import income must go hand in hand. Hence, this budget has laid the foundation to promote entrepreneurship, Minister Abeywardena added.
Govt. planning to privatise Sri Lankan Airlines:Dr Nalinda Jayatissa
The Government is highlighting the debt of Sri Lankan Airlines to prepare people's minds to privatise it, JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa said.
Joining in the Second Reading debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament yesterday, the MP pointed out that the Government had been publishing newspaper advertisements on the debt burden of Sri Lankan Airlines for the sake of changing public opinion in favour of privatising it.
He pointed out under the competitive market economy, country's public institutions have constantly been weakened over the past decades. Public institutions were sold and neglected.
This Government is doing the same. We object to this budget not because we are against the proposals in it, but because we are against its open economic principles which have been proven a flop, he commented.
Going by budgetary proposals to convert all Government vehicles either to hybrid or electric vehicles by 2025, the MP suggested the Government not to present supplementary allocations to purchase new vehicles during the next couple of years, but to use up the existing vehicles.
The JVP MP also objected to the proposal to bring down the prices of beer, stating that it would provoke more people to start drinking liquor.
I request the Government to withdraw this proposal. The statistics of liquor consumption the minister presented were not correct, he added.
The MP also compared the money allocated to a number of budgetary proposals with the monthly rent the Government is paying to the Agriculture Ministry building in Rajagiriya, which is still unused, adding that two months rent of the building is higher than the total amount allocated to many important budgetary proposals.
Govt. attempting to hand over shipping industry to Int'l companies: Rohitha
Through Budget 2018, the government has lifted the 40 - 60 percent ratio of foreign ownership in the shipping industry and presently propose to permit foreign entities full access into the shipping industry which is bound to destroy the local shipping agents businesses, said Kalutara District MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena.
He said so in Parliament yesterday, joining the Second Reading debate of Budget 2018.
Through this budget the government has hidden its real motives and presented a fancy budget that had cut right into the pressure points of the local shipping industry. There is nothing in this budget that would benefit local farmers, dairy farmers and local businesses. This budget has opened the doors to foreign investors to come in and destroy the local businesses, he charged.
Abeygunawardena accused the government of completely bringing down the shipping agents and destroying their businesses through the budget. He said around 100,000 jobs are generated through the shipping industry. Even now without any international assistance these agents are handling the needs of the shipping industry efficiently. They handle import, export procedures and container handling with ease and efficiency. But now the government is trying to hand over the shipping industry to international companies on a platter. So far, they had to operate their businesses through local agents, but at present, they could just stroll in and set up their own companies and in a single stride the government had struck down one of the thriving industries in this country as the shipping industry. Currently, the country earns foreign exchange to the tune of $ 600 - 800 million, but once parent companies set up office here, these transactions would be carried out in those countries and Sri Lanka would lose that income as well.
He said although the government had promised to provide 100,000 jobs, but now it seems like they the government is trying to destroy the existing jobs as well.
'Ministry ready to accept viable energy generation project'
The Power and Renewable Energy Ministry is ready accept anybody's viable renewable energy generation project using hot water springs, said Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera yesterday.
He said that if there is one with such a project proposal viable and practical, he would be most welcome by the Ministry. "What such a person has to do is to meet him and not make facebook posts that his project was rejected by the authorities," said Deputy Minister Perera. He made these observations yesterday in Parliament during the round of questions for oral answers to a query raised by JVP parliamentarian Nihal Galappatti.
MP Galappatti charged that the facebook had posts on a person who is ready to migrate from Sri Lanka for there was none to accept his project proposal to generate power using hot watersprings.
Details of foreigners at Voice of America will be provided:Alagiyawanna
Mass Media and Megapolis Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna promised to provide Parliament with details of all foreigners who worked at the Voice of Americas transmission center at Iranawila.
He made this pledge, responding to a question raised by JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake during the round of questions for oral answers.
Deputy Minister Alagiyawanna said the Voice of America had suspended its operations in Iranawila with effect from Dec. 31, 2016. The Voice of America started its operations since 1985. It had been given 672 acres and 3 roods of land in Iranawila as per the provisions of an agreement dated January 15, 1985 between the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Service and the US Government. He also said the agreement was later amended on Dec 09, 1991 and the land area was reduced to 408 acres. The land had been given to the Voice of America on a lease basis. It had paid Rs. 40,000 per month at the beginning and slightly increased the amount been paid as lease. As at December last year, the payment was Rs 100,000.
Deputy Minister Alagiyawanna: The transmission station is closed. Land has now been taken under the government. Some of its property had been given to the SLBC. Some vehicles were given to Telecom and the Divisional Secretariat of the area. There is a proposal to develop the land as a tourism zone.

Public officials need re-assurance
President Maithripala Sirisena observed that during the last three years public officials have increasingly shown a resistance to go along with wrong decisions of ministers, under whom they serve, which he saw as positive development. Addressing the National Awards Ceremony, organised by the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA), to recognise State Institutions with a high level of performance, at the Parliament Complex, on Monday, President Sirisena noted that public officials have developed a fear to commit wrongdoing, fraud and engage in corruption, in the last three years, giving rise to a positive culture in the public service. Public officials fear to commit wrong had vanished over the past years, especially due to the misconduct of politicians. We have been able to gradually change this attitude. Now I hear them saying that they would have to go to the CID, or the FCID, if they do wrong. We have had a committed, clean, public service, in the past, and I want to restore the same in the country, under my rule, the President went onto assert.
The number of state officials, who served under Mahinda Rajapaksa, now being paraded before the various Commissions and the courts, give an indication of the extent of the pusillanimity of our public servants, confronted with the illegal orders, of government ministers, in that era. The sil redi case is a stand out in this regard, where public funds, amounting Rs. 600 million, was spent without batting an eyelid, by an official, who was the topmost public servant, in the country. Need one elaborate on the situation that would have obtained down the line
It is not that we were wanting in upright officials, who stood up to politicians, who wanted their illegal orders carried out. The pluck and courage shown by the former OIC of the Peliyagoda Police, Inspector Samurdhajeewa, who point blank refused to release the notorious criminal Baddegane Sanjeewa, on the orders of the onetime powerful Chief of the Presidential Security Division SSP Nihal Karunaratne, readily comes to mind. The intrepid OIC, no doubt, knew he was treading on dangerous territory, and, would have to pay dearly for his darring. But this did not deter him from refusing to carry out an illegal order. There was also the famous case of a DIG ordering out a powerful minister out of the Galle Police station, for forcing the police to execute an illegal order. Among officers, from the Civil Service too, there were individuals who refused to toe the line, and, who quit, leaving their honesty and integrity intact. Such officials, lamentably, were few and far between.
Of course, the rot set in the early sixties, in the aftermath of the attempted coup detat, to topple the Sirima Bandaranaike government, by a section of the security establishment. The backbone of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service, which, up to that point, was stiff and erect, was broken, with politicians starting to rule the roost.
This is why, the new culture that is woven into service, where public officials have become bold is to be welcomed. This has been doubly reinforced, with powerful government ministers, too, being arraigned before the investigating commissions, to answer for their acts of omissions and commissions pertaining to expending of public funds. Nay, no less a personage than the Prime Minister had been summoned before the Presidential Commission on the Bond Scam, merely because some reference was made to him, during the hearings.
Juxtapose this scenario with the Rajapaksa era, when the countrys first lady Chief Justice was given short shrift, and, driven out of office for ruling against a Rajapaksa sibling, who wanted to spend billions of public funds, by-passing parliament. Not only that, the Attorney Generals Department was turned into a cipher, of the ruling clan, with orders going out to close the files of individuals arraigned for rape and murder, breaking the spirit of its officials. Public officials were made to grovel before powerful ministers.
Be that as it may, the government should ensure that the kith and kin of ministers, or, their favourites, are not appointed to responsible positions in the public service. It is not just the ministry secretaries who carry out illegal orders. There are other appointees, who owe their positions to the subject minister, who may wield more power than even the secretaries and use their clout to cause loss to the public, by illegal acts. These movers and shakers, too, should come under the scrutiny of the authorities.
The President should also extend a firm guarantee to the public officials that they would, under no circumstances, be penalised for resisting politicians, to carry out illegal orders. This includes transfers to other posts in different ministries. The recent transfer of the Chairman of the Mineral Sands Corporation, to another post, over a dispute in the import of a coal consignment, and, the eviction of the former Director General of the Wildlife Department are two such instances. It would certainly send the wrong message to others, that, it would not pay to be honest.

Rajapakshes about turn preposterous -Sumanthiran
TNA parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran responding to former Justice and Buddasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshes accusations that the Constitutional Assembly process is illegal, says Rajapakshe was one of the original proponents of the resolution to form a Constitutional Assembly.
Former Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has taken up the position that the Constitutional Assembly process is illegal - Id like to point out that he is one of the original proposers of the resolution that was placed before Parliament on January 9, 2016, which proposed the setting up of this Constitutional Assembly, the TNA parliamentarian told the Daily News.
He is actually one of the drafters of that resolution having proposed it to Parliament. He has also been a member of the Steering Committee which met 73 times and he has attended more than 50 times and participated fully in that process. He has even drafted certain portions of the Interim Report that was tabled before the Constitutional Assembly recently, Sumanthiran said.
He said Rajapakshe was fully aware of this process and was satisfied that it was entirely constitutional and legal.
His opposition now arises only because he has been sacked from the Cabinet, the TNA parliamentarian said.
He added, He cant say that he did not know of the implications of this.
He holds two doctoral degrees and is a Presidents Counsel.
He has been President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka and at the time he was the Justice Minister.
Such a person cant now suddenly say the process is illegal, having participated fully and having himself proposed the mechanism.

Sagala responds to baseless and malicious allegations
Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka categorically denied allegations that he had a secret meeting with former Presidents Chief of Staff Gamini Senarath, who is suspected to have embezzled Rs.4 billion in public money.
Ratnayaka in a statement said that he has no reason to meet a suspect in a corruption case which involves billions of public money.
I have nothing to gain by holding a meeting with a person of that calibre, he said.
The full statement:
It is widely known that a small clique affiliated with the top-brass leaders of the previous government were involved in large scale bribery and corruption cases.
Their corrupt practices pushed over 6.2 million people to come forward on January 08, 2015, in a bid to topple the Rajapaksa government.
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who gave leadership to these progressive forces, played prominent roles in this silent revolution.
The Government of Good Governance and its ministers came to power with the promise of investigating into these cases of large scale corruption and bringing the culprits to book.
I, as the Minister of Law and Order, have a special responsibility in this regard and I must state that I am committed and determined to fulfill that responsibility.
Despite many challenges and obstacles, the Sri Lanka Police, the Police Criminal Investigations Department (CID), and the Police Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) and I, as the Minister, endeavour to deliver results, in this regard.
It is in this context that a section of the media, including some online publications and social media pages, have published news items indicating that former Presidents Chief of Staff Gamini Senarath, who is suspected to have embezzled Rs 4 billion of public money, had a secret meeting with me.
This a baseless and malicious allegation. I have no reason to meet a suspect in a corruption case which involves billions of public money. I have nothing to gain by holding meeting with a person of that calibre.
Therefore, I categorically deny this malicious allegation with the contempt it deserves. I am of the firm belief that a handful of bankrupt political elements with hidden agendas are behind this propaganda campaign.

SL Budget keeps to IMF plan,  but fiscals still weak - Fitch
Sri Lankas budget for 2018 sticks broadly to the targets for fiscal deficit reduction under its three-year IMF programme, which began in June 2016.
However, high government debt and the large cost of debt servicing weigh heavily on Sri Lankas credit profile and will require sustained fiscal consolidation over the long term, says Fitch Ratings.
The recently announced budget targets a fiscal deficit of 4.8% of GDP in 2018, which is only slightly above the 4.7% target agreed with the IMF and continues the consolidation that began in 2016. Floods and drought weighed on the economy and public finances during 2017, and contributed to the government missing its initial 2017 fiscal deficit target of 4.6% of GDP. Nevertheless, the authorities still expect the 2017 deficit outturn to fall to 5.2% of GDP, from 5.4% in 2016. Consolidation in 2017 has been driven by measures to boost tax revenue, including a hike in the value-added tax (VAT) to 15% in November 2016 from 11%.
The government expects revenue to rise strongly again in 2018, to 15.7% of GDP, from 14.7% in 2017. Revenue should be supported by an Inland Revenue Act passed in September 2016, provided implementation is effective.
The act, which will come into effect from 1 April 2018, aims to simplify the tax laws and improve the efficiency of the system. Despite these positive reforms, we see downside risks to the governments revenue projections, given that they are based on a GDP growth assumption of 5%-6% for next year, compared with our own of 4.5%.
On the expenditure side, the government expects public investment spending to rise by 20% in 2018, while recurring spending is forecast to decline. Interest payments are expected to account for more than one-third of total revenue, which is a key weakness in the fiscal profile.
Addressing long-standing weaknesses in Sri Lankas public finances will require an extended commitment to consolidation from the authorities. In particular, we highlighted the importance of a stabilisation of government debt ratios when we affirmed Sri Lankas rating at B+ with a Stable Outlook in February 2017.
The government debt/GDP ratio rose to 79.3% of GDP in 2016 - well above the 60.9% median for sovereigns rated B or lower - and we estimate that it will increase again in 2017.
Our baseline projection is still that government debt ratios will stabilise within the next couple of years, but these forecasts are vulnerable to fiscal slippage or an economic downturn.
Exchange rate depreciation could also push up the local-currency value of government debt, given around 40% of the total was denominated in foreign currency at end-2016, according to Fitch estimates.
Sri Lanka's external position was the other factor that led the government into an IMF programme. Foreign-exchange reserves rose to USD7.5 billion at end-October, from USD 6.1 billion at end-2016, and we estimate reserves could be sufficient to cover 3.3 months of current account payment by end-2017. However, the external liquidity ratio, at 65.6%, is still well below the 'B' median of 134.2%, according to our estimates.
Sri Lanka faces a challenging external debt service schedule in the near term, with very large external debt maturities coming up over 2019-22.

South Africa eyes 2023 prize as bitter battle ends
London: The fog of war that has afflicted the race to host the 2023 Rugby World Cup will lift on Wednesday and is expected to reveal South Africa as outright victor to stage the quadrennial showpiece.
Two weeks ago the Rugby World Cup board released a report placing South Africa first across a range of criteria on which the candidates were assessed, ranging from stadiums to financial assurances
France, second, and Ireland, third, came out swinging in response to the report and have been as combative as their players on the pitch, slamming the findings that placed South Africa in the driving seat.
Had they been on the field of play -- where rugby players distinguish themselves from footballers for their polite acceptance of the referees decision -- the Irish and French would have earned at least a sin-binning.
World Rugby replied with clarifications but it is now up to the 39 votes on its Council to decide whether they accept the unanimous decision of the Rugby World Cup board to award South Africa the hosting rights for the second time.
South Africa hosted the iconic 1995 edition -- which saw the first black president of the country, Nelson Mandela, adorned in a Springbok jersey, then seen as one of the pillars of white apartheid rule -- handing the trophy to white South Africa captain Francois Pienaar.
South Africa vice-president Cyril Ramaphosa, one of the architects of the relatively peaceful transition from apartheid, said a 2023 World Cup in the country would serve as affirmation of much of what the late Mandela stood for.
In 1995 it was an almost-white team, said Ramaphosa when he added his sizeable political weight to the final presentation in September.
In 2023 it will be a diverse rugby team and prove to the world what Nelson Mandela said, that rugby is a great unifier.
It will be played out in reality that a country coming from a sad past, we will have achieved Nelson Mandelas dream of a true rainbow nation.
The Irish too have invested a huge amount of political capital into the bid with Prime Minister Leo Varadkar leading the bid presentation and securing the support of his British counterpart Theresa May -- plus the cross border support of all the Northern Irish parties.
The Irish, probably for the first time in bid history, cited Albert Einstein in their letter seeking clarification about the disappointing assessment of their bid. Philip Browne, the dynamic CEO of the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU), admitted in an interview with AFP last Friday that not even the great man could help reconcile World Rugbys vision of the tournament with Irelands views.
In our letter (seeking clarification), we had a great saying by Albert Einstein and here I paraphrase him: There are a lot of things that can be counted which dont actually count and there are lots of things that count that cant be counted, he said.
In some respect that comes down to our vision and what we are offering.
A World Cup in Ireland would be a particular World Cup, something which fans round the world would have enjoyed.
But apparently that wasnt part of the overall vision World Rugby had for it.
The French would deliver the most money for the sport but their bid has been bedevilled by internal political problems surrounding federation president Bernard Laporte and also their decision to fly over the young sons of the late All Blacks legend Jonah Lomu for the final presentation that backfired spectacularly.
The irrepressible Laporte -- who guided France to two successive World Cup semi-finals and subsequently served as a minister under President Nicolas Sarkozy -- has not minced his words in his response to the assessment on a whole range of topics from security to doping to hotels.
We are not rated as well over doping because they tell us that we are too strict! On security, we have the same number of points even though there are 52 murders a day in South Africa, Laporte told AFP earlier this month. AFP

Sri Lanka dare to dream  of India Test upset
KOLKATA, Tuesday  Captain Dinesh Chandimal is dreaming of Sri Lanka making history by winning a Test in India -- despite being huge underdogs against the world's top-ranked side when the series begins in Kolkata on Thursday.
Sri Lanka lost all nine matches -- three Tests, five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 international -- as they were humiliated at home by Virat Kohli's tourists from late July to September.
The island nation have still never won a Test on Indian soil but they head for Eden Gardens with renewed hopes after winning both Tests against Pakistan in the UAE last month and Chandimal believes dreams can come true.
We did really well against Pakistan and the boys are in a good shape, Chandimal said.
We know India are the number one team at the moment and have seen them play some really good cricket in the last two years. This will be a challenging series for us.
We have never won a Test in India. So it's a dream for us to win one this time. We need to start well in this series, he declared.
Sri Lanka lost all three home Tests this year against India inside four days with Chandimal terming it their worst ever series.
Coach Nic Pothas, who took over after Graham Ford left in June, said the India debacle had taught his team vital lessons.
We learnt how Indian team does well and the areas we needed to improve, he said.
It's internal - the discipline, the culture and how the teams stick together, Pothas said.
The mistake you can make here is come and be infatuated with the Indian side and concentrating too much on them. We know they are a good side. But we played them months ago, the South African added.
Fifties from Dimuth Karunaratne, Angelo Mathews and Niroshan Dickwella gave Sri Lanka a solid start to the tour in their two-day game against the Board President's XI in Kolkata.
All-rounder Mathews, who is returning from a calf injury that made him miss the Pakistan Tests, will be employed solely as a batsman.
Veteran Rangana Herath will lead Sri Lanka's spin attack, supported by Dilruwan Perera and left-arm unorthodox Lakshan Sandakan.
Kohli's India are looking to consolidate their top Test ranking and keep their winning run intact on home soil.
The Indians have not lost a home series in any format since being beaten by South Africa in one-dayers in 2015.
Sri Lanka will be India's last home challenge before heading off on tough tours to South Africa and England next year.
First target is to win the first Test and get momentum to win the series, wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha said on Monday.
With leading all-rounder Hardik Pandya rested for the first two matches, the focus will be on senior spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, who were rested for the last month's limited-overs matches against Australia and New Zealand.
The second Test begins on November 24 in Nagpur with the final match starting in Delhi on December 2. The two sides will also play three one-day internationals and three Twenty20 matches.

Strict laws to thwart human smuggling
Sri Lanka is now formulating a legal structure and mechanisms to combat human smuggling and protecting its borders, Prime Ministers Chief of Staff, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said.
He disclosed this addressing the seminar on combating the International Human Smuggling racket held at the Kingsbury Hotel, Colombo yesterday.
Minister Ratnayaka said stringent laws were needed to combat the human smuggling racket and combating the racket would not be possible without stringent laws and regulations. Extensive raids will be conducted to net in suspects involved in this racket.
The government hopes to implement laws and regulations in this regard to the letter and introduce new laws and regulations where necessary.
Ratnayaka said the Australian Institute of Strategic Policies had already conducted research on the human smuggling racket in Sri Lanka which had made several important revelations.
The government now had vital information regarding this racket carried out mostly in the Western, Wayamba and the Southern Coasts lines. Vital information regrading the racketeers, their modus operandi are in government possession today. This involves surreptitious preparation of passports and bribing of relevant officials. A mechanism had to be devised to combat all these fraudulent activities.
Sri Lanka had recently entered into an MOU with Australia in this regard which will help Sri Lanka to work closely with Australia in combating this racket by exchanging vital information regarding the racketeers involved in order to break the back of this racket.
The Minister said the human smuggling racket is an organised international racket rather than an individual racket. As such international co-operation including that of the Interpol was essential to combat it.

TEA welcomes economic reforms in Government Budget
The Tea Exporters Association (TEA) welcomes the government budget especially the proposals for trade reforms presented to the Parliament by Mangala Samaraweera, Minister of Finance last week.
The proposals under the theme of Enterprise Sri Lanka to reform the existing trade regulations are in the right direction to enhance the competitiveness of local industries and service sector.
The budget proposals are focused on economic sustainability and promoting investment by introducing many reforms to all key sectors such as agriculture, industries, tourism, IT, trade and research. The entrepreneurs of the country need to face the challenges of globalization without further delay. The revision of certain trade regulations was long overdue in relation to the open economic policies of the government.
TEA always believes that Sri Lanka has a huge potential to develop as a trading hub in the region due to its strategic location. The proposal to liberalize the shipping and logistic sector is very much appreciated as it would help exporters to get more competitive shipping rates that would enhance its competitiveness to foreign buyers.
TEA also welcome the proposed Export Market Access Support scheme for companies whose turnover is less than USD 10 million per annum. The recommendation for product development and facilitation of trade information will also support the growth of the export sector. The proposal to set up a dedicated unit at the Ministry of Finance to monitor the implementation of budget proposals would be appreciated by everybody as follow up on the implementation of proposals is important to achieve the objectives of the budget. The government initiative to protect the environment and recommendations for a green Sri Lanka in the coming years is also in line with the new international trade and consumer trends.

Teenage orphans report violations at Darun Nusra
In sworn statements to Police, 18 young women who were living at the Darun Nusra orphanage in Dehiwala said they were systematically sexually harassed and abused by a long-time male employee.
They said they repeatedly complained about the behavior to the mans wife, the resident administrator of the orphanage, and were told not to take it seriously. In response she threatened them, saying that the orphanage would be shut down if they reported the abuse, Police documents show.
The Kohuwala Police have since charged Mohamed Sarippuge Mohar, 62, with sexually harassing the girls in the orphanage.
The statements made before the Police during the course of the investigation revealed that one of the 18 girls was seriously harassed by the alleged perpetrator, leading them to file separate charges against the suspect for serious harassment.
NCPA Chairperson Marini De Livera.
Marini de Livera, the Chairperson of the National Child Protection Authority, said the case is one of the most significant her office is currently investigating.
And yet, despite the charges against Mohar, Dr. Mareena Reffai, the founder of the Almuslimaath Foundation, which oversees the orphanage, dismisses the young womens accounts as fabrications.
There has been no medical evidence of sexual abuse of any child, she said in a statement after Mohars July 25 arrest. Instead, she argued, the allegations are part of a plot by employees to take over the orphanage.
Reached by phone, Dr. Reffai stood by her defense. As far as we are concerned, we dont have any evidence at all, she said. She said the investigation continuing for three months, and Mohars subsequent release on bail, was proof that there wasnt evidence of sexual misconduct.
But NCPA Chairperson de Livera flatly denied Reffais assertion.
Thats stupid, she said. Thats what they always say.
The perpetrators side is always very powerful, she added. (They) will do everything possible to sweep it under the carpet.
After initially being taken into protective custody, the girls are now living once again in the orphanage, according to Western Province Department of Probation Commissioner Chandima Dissanayake.
The matron and the husband have been removed, she said, which lead probation officers to believe it was safe to return.
But it appears the foundations leadership is skeptical of the ongoing sexual harassment investigation, highlighted by Dr. Reffais statements. NCPA Chairperson de Livera added that the investigation into the allegations is lagging, because authorities have had a hard time getting the institution, and the victims, to communicate with Police.
Reffai, on the other hand, said she and her organization have cooperated with investigators 100 percent.
Its a difficult job, said de Livera. We are delving deep into it, because we dont want them to wriggle out of it at the preliminary hearing in court.
The case
Mohamed Sarippuge Mohar was a driver at Darun Nusra orphanage for nine years. He drove the girls to and from the international school they attended every day, according to the account he gave to Police.
The victims say that much of the alleged sexual abuse occurred in his vehicle.
This man took me to school every day, and would harass me on the way and touch me, one of the young women told officers, whose names Police have concealed to protect their identities.
When I complained to his wife, she said dont take it seriously, and scolded me. Every time I complained, she scolded me, she said. In addition, the man took me to a store room and touched me inappropriately.
All 18 young women accused Mohar of touching them in the transport vehicle, Police reports show. Some said the unwanted contact also occurred in the orphanage.
When nobody is around, he hugs me and kisses me, another girl said.
Mohars wife, Sithi Saahira, told investigators that her husband loved those girls, and didnt mean to hurt them. She denied any harassment had taken place.
On July 22, the Kohuwala Police received a call from officers at the National Child Protection Authority, who said that someone had reported the abuse to their anonymous phone line. Officers went to the orphanage and took all 18 girls into protective custody the same day, Police records show.
Three days later, they arrested Mohar. Police said they also found CCTV cameras all over the orphanage, some of them in the girls rooms.
Orphanages response
In the fallout of the arrest, the President of the Almuslimaath foundation resigned.
I am forced to make this drastic decision as I am unable to function in this position any longer, given the way matters are being conducted within this organization, Shana Mohinudeen, who served as president and on the executive committee, said in a July 26 letter.
In the letter, Mohinudeen said she brought up the allegations of sexual harassment at a July 24 committee meeting.
As I started speaking Dr. Mareena immediately reprimanded me for discussing this at the committee meeting. Along with me, (two others) voiced their concerns and we were all asked to shut up, she said.
Darun Nusra Orphanage.
This despicable act has been taking place at Darun Nusra from the year 2015, which Dr. Mareena had been aware of, and it is shocking that despite her being aware, the perpetrator was employed at Darun Nusra until he was arrested, she added.
Repeated attempts to reach Mohinudeen were unsuccessful. A secretary from Almuslimaath confirmed that she no longer worked for the foundation.
Mohar has since been released on bail, and is due to appear in Gangodawila Magistrates Court on December 7.
He and his wife no longer work for the orphanage. The girls remain at the home, and are attending school, Western Province Probation Commissioner Disanayake said.
But the upper management of Almuslimaath continues to deny the young womens allegations.
In a phone interview Monday, Dr. Reffai said the fact that probation allowed the girls back into the home, after the suspect and his wife were dismissed, was proof no harassment had occurred.
Why would they give the girls back to us if its not safe here, she said.
Reffai did attempt to distance herself from her former employee, saying we have nothing to do with him or against him, and adding that she would accept the allegations in the case of a guilty verdict against Mohar.
But it appears that for now, her mind is made up against the girls accounts. As far as we know, the Police havent found any evidence, she repeated.
Before hurling accusations please find out the truth, she said in a written statement. Or else you will be answerable in this world and the next.

Trends of global energy
Economics starts by saying that the resources possess scarcity and this leads to the solution of managing those resources in an efficient manner, so that it will be benefitted to any single entity in the society. This particular statement accounts partly for global energy because energy can be regarded as a resource for any country.
However energy resources are unevenly distributed and if all countries were to make do with their own resources, there would be even more energy poverty in the world than there is now.
Access to energy is a unique factor in the modern world where the energy demand keeps flying day-by-day. The conventional energy demand which found few decades back has ripped its way for current demand hikes and this has a lot of influence on globalization. According to the well-known index of globalization-KOF (Sri Lanka 51.81 in 2017), it is a process that removes national borders and integrates into economies, policies, and technologies which influence in energy demand and supply.
The world economy is expected to be almost double over the next 20 years, with growth averaging 3.4% per annum. The boom in Asian markets and production growth in many countries has paved its way for high energy demand. Much of the expected growth in the global economy is driven by emerging economies like China and India where they accounts for around half of the increase.
Future energy demand
On the other hand the worlds population is projected to increase by around 1.5 billion people to reach nearly 8.8 billion people by 2035. The projected gains in productivity leads to increasing global prosperity, with more than 2 billion people lifted from low income which contributes in more demand.
In this light any country is compelled to plan in meeting their future energy demand. In that sense two major areas are to look for. This includes the ways adopted for optimum management of existing energy resources and exploiting and investing new sources of energies. The immerging technological world trends that relate to energy to be considered in tracking new means and their suitability along with the impacts they create. For example the risk incorporated in nuclear power plants and the emissions of coal power plants has more effect than cutting down of production cost.
When speaking of oil as an energy resource an oligopoly market structure could be seen in the global scenario where the access retains in the hands of a few and the prices are determined by a collective cartel.
A formal agreement to collusion is called a cartel. Countries with access to their own oil reserves acts together to maximize their profits by restricting output collectively. Each firm then receives their respective shares of profits based on their share of the market. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is a permanent, intergovernmental Organisation which can be listed as an ideal example. In this regard economies of other countries are influenced by the determined price and output by OPEC.
Global oil demand is projected for an increase by around 15 million barrels per day (Mb/d), to reach 110 million barrels per day by 2035. OPEC is assumed to account for nearly 70% of global supply growth and Non-OPEC supply grows by just over 4 Mb/d by 2035 with growth from the US (4 Mb/d), Brazil (2 Mb/d), Russia (1 Mb/d) and Canada (0.5 Mb/d) largely offset by declines in high-cost. Transport accounts for almost two-thirds of the growth in overall demand.
Renewable energies
Coal and Nuclear power is used to meet the domestic and industrial demand of many countries. Growth in global coal demand seen slowing down sharply relative to the past (0.2% p.a. versus 2.7% p.a. over the past 20 years). Nevertheless global coal consumption is expected with a peak in the mid-2020s. Nuclear capacity in Europe declines as ageing plants are gradually decommissioned and there reported low amounts for new investment.
Expected EU nuclear power generation by 2035 will be 30% which is lower than in 2015. Japan is assumed to restart some of its reactors gradually over the first half of the year. Nuclear and hydro power generations are expected to grow steadily by 2.3% p.a. and 1.8% p.a. respectively, broadly maintaining their combined share within the power sector.
When looking at those trends the world attention focus more towards renewable energies as it gives more prospects.
Renewable accounts for 40% of the growth in power generation, causing their share of global power to increase from 7% in 2015 to nearly 20% by 2035.
China is the largest source of growth over the next 20 years, adding more renewable power than the EU and US combined. The strong growth in renewable energy is underpinned by the view that the competitiveness of both solar and wind power improves significantly.
The cost of solar power is expected to continue to fall, although the pace of that reduction slows, as the rapidly-declining PV module costs account for a decreasing share of the total installed solar costs.
In contrast, wind power costs are assumed to fall materially, reflecting the view that there is considerable scope to improve the performance of wind turbines in harvesting the wind. Assessing the competitive needs of renewable to take into account the costs of ensuring system stability as increasing amounts of intermittent energy are added.
Detailed analysis of these costs (which vary significantly across technologies and countries) indicate that they are likely to be relatively low for the levels of penetration projected out to 2035.
Some energy efficient countries are trying hard to ensure that they can save as much money on energy, decrease as much possible energy used and their effect on the environment. Some countries have set their goals to becoming more energy efficient. Germany has been ranked the most energy efficient in the world.
Both topdown and bottomup energy policy models seen developed at addressing various policies and planning concerns in developed countries. These models provide a good starting point for analyzing issues in modern industries of developing countries where improvement in operations, impact of technology mix, and effects of certain aspects taken into consideration.

US Rimas Foundation to start  operations in Sri Lanka
US based Rimas Foundation, involved in investment banking, lending and providing business solutions is looking to set up operations in Sri Lanka.
President and CEO, Rimas Foundation, Oriando, USA, Khawar Ali Khan speaking to Daily News Business, while visiting the Foundation of Goodness in Seenigama said that they are looking at lending to mainly to Micro and SME sectors initially. We hope to disperse around US$ 3 million in the first year of operations.
He said that their main aim is to assist the small time entrepreneurs offer them credit and even expertise to move up to the next level at a very low interest (single digit) rate and with less collateral.
He said that under this this system first to be implemented in the Galle District, they hope offer credit starting from Rs. 50,000 to 250,000 and these would be dispersed on the recommendation of civil societies or via organizations like Foundation of Goodness in Seenigama.
This model is implemented in several other developing countries in Africa and it has proved to be very successful. We have observed that after around three years the project becomes self-sufficient in funding. The next level is setting up of a bank and we hope this same pattern would continue in Sri Lanka as well, leading up to a setting up of an investment bank in the future.
Ali Khan said that they were also happy in the manner in which Foundation of Goodness in Seenigama is operating and the facilities it offers to people in the area in entrepreneurship, education, beauty culture, photography, IT, Vocational training, tourism, sports, health and other areas. We may tie up with them to offer lending to the public and its Chairman, Kushil Gunasekera and his team has knowledge of the people involved in MICRO and SME sectors in the area.
The people in Galle had to forgo not only their dearest ones but also businesses after the tsunami and some of them are yet to recover and move back to business. We also hope to make a difference in a few lives in Sri Lanka and plans to continue to do so until we could do no more.
He said that they will also meet the American Embassy officials and seek their assistance to get necessary approvals in Sri Lanka to launch this project from next January.

Well worth the effort: Ave Maria Convent
In this fast-moving world, Head Prefect of Ave Maria Convent Shankini Pathirana has acquired the qualities of a shepherdess of people by being educated under Good Shepherd nuns. Shankini who believes innocence and compassion are as important as intelligence now takes care of her flock caringly.
Shankini says that from her childhood she has been taught to place her faith in Jesus who is an example of love and compassion and also a tremendous leader. She also says that we live in a world where compassion amongst and within leaders is fading. And that we should develop and protect this quality to grow among us.
Spiritual value
We live in a world where youngsters are addicted to drugs and terrorism today. They should be guided in a manner that they realize the disastrous outcome of it. The youth need to be inspired by the actions of their leaders. They must be taught that peace is glorious. They need to be taught that discussion is more important than arguments. They need to be taught that talking and resolving a matter peacefully has spiritual value.
Taking all of this into consideration Pathirana thinks communication plays a vital part in the world today. As leaders, she feels that we need to be flexible and decision making and communication are so important.
Pathiarana is an A/L student in the science stream, who intends to studying medicine. She also has an interest in Molecular Biology. An only child she believes in good family values. Her father works in a money exchange in Dubai and she lives with her mother. She feels that family values are a must since you need to receive love from the family. Parental support must be there for a child to succeed in life. In her life, her role model is her mother.
Pathirana, who studies in a Catholic school has been brought up amongst Good Shepherd nuns. She feels that the life she has got is a gift from God.
Second home
Ave Maria is a fountain that showers children with Education love, care and moral values. Its vision is to produce good shepherdesses to the world. I need to be a leader who takes good care of my flock. I joined Ave Maria Convent from Grade One itself, and my parents and I never thought that I would come this far! The reason who I am today is because of my school and I love my school sincerely. My personality, talents and skills have been moulded by Ave Maria Convent and Ave Maria is my second home. When you become a Head Girl you become a link between the school administration as well as the students. I deal with two different levels of people. I am dealing with youngsters and with elders. So it is a big challenge being the link between those two groups, said Pathirana
Pathirana is a netball player and was on the first tennis team of Ave Maria Convent. She has also obtained Western Province colours for Throwball. She has been a chess player too.
We call each other and we come to practices daily and I have made a lot of friends. We learn team spirit. If I did not do netball I would not have been in this position. That gave me a great advantage and helped me become a Head Prefect. It gave me a good bunch of friends. I have learned how to accept victory and defeat alike, said Pathirana.
Ave Maria rewards students for their efforts, and awards positions to those girls who strive for excellence. Give your fullest to the school without being selfish says Pathirana. She also added that today in the world a lot of students are very selfish and it has become a rat race. She emphasised that first we need to become selfless. Then the rest will be in the hands of God.
Firstly I want to thank and praise the Almighty Father for giving me such a good life. I also want to thank my parents. They are always behind me. They have been the pillars of my success. I must thank my former Principal Rev. Sr. Shirani Algama because she recognised my skills promoted me and appointed me. I must also thank my present Principal Rev. Sister Shermila Jayawardene, who is behind everything I do. She always advises me. I must also thank my teachers who touched my life from the moment I stepped into the school I thank my fellow prefects for their support. They are a bunch of multi-talented prefects. They have given their utmost to me. I consider them my sisters, said Pathirana.
She wishes Ave Maria to go from generation to generation inculcating noble values producing worthy citizens.School Committee
