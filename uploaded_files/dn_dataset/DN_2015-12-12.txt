Blatter says $100 mn bribery case is 'over'

TOKYO, FRIDAY: Suspended FIFA president Sepp Blatter insisted that a $100 million bribery case in which he is reportedly implicated "is over", and pleaded ignorance over alleged corruption by top officials at the scandal-hit world body.
Blatter, speaking to Japan's Nikkei business daily, also protested that he should have been warned before Swiss police arrested seven FIFA officials in May, and said he hoped to return to his job in the coming weeks.
"It was a tsunami," he said of the May arrests on behalf of US authorities, which plunged the world body into crisis, in the interview published on Friday.
"Swiss authorities should have at least informed me that such a thing would happen," Blatter said, adding that he was "shocked when I saw, and (what is) still going on, what has happened in the different confederations".
"I cannot be morally responsible for the bad activities of members of my executive committee when I have no chance to introduce them or to dismiss them," Blatter said.
The arrests in Zurich kick-started events which forced Blatter to announce his resignation. He is now suspended from FIFA as Swiss authorities investigate the alleged misappropriation of funds and a $2 million payment to UEFA chief Michel Platini.
Blatter, who suffered a health scare last month, said he would be fully recovered by Christmas and hoped to be back in office in time to hand over to his successor, who will be elected on February 26.

HOBART, FRIDAY: Nathan Lyon put the skids under the flailing West Indies as Australia set course for an overwhelming early victory despite Darren Bravo holding on in the first Test in Hobart on Friday.
At the close of a stop-start day through showers, the Windies were 207 for six with Bravo offering spirited resistance on 94 and Kemar Roach in support on 31.
Bravo and Roach kept the Windies innings pulse beating with an unbeaten seventh-wicket stand of 91.
"I think the guys are confident in Darren and me at the crease. We've done a pretty good job so far, hopefully we can carry on tomorrow and do a much better job," Roach said.
Lyon claimed two wickets in one over to trigger a middle-order collapse to have the West Indies in familiar trouble in their chase after a mammoth declaration of 583 for four on the second day.
The probing off-spinner snared the wickets of Marlon Samuels and Jermaine Blackwood in his seventh over along with opener Rajendra Chandrika for 175 Test wickets to leave the hapless Caribbean tourists struggling to avoid a heavy defeat with three days left.
"I'm really confident in my skill set to get the job done. The ball is coming out beautifully out of my hand in the nets and I've been working hard," said Lyon, who is playing in his 50th Test match.
The Windies sticky predicament was accentuated by the dismissal of skipper Jason Holder, the last of the recognised batsmen at the crease with Bravo. AFP

Cheetahs on duty at S.African air base attack officer

SOUTH AFRICA: Two male cheetahs that were released last week at a South African military air base to chase small animals off the runway have instead attacked a female officer, officials said Thursday.
The warrant officer was attacked while trying to photograph the pair of collared captive-bred cheetahs, a colleague who declined to be identified told AFP.
"The lady was trying to take a picture and then she got injured, but... it's not a serious injury," she told AFP.
The incident occurred on Tuesday at Makhado Air Force Base in the northeast near the border with Zimbabwe, the force said in a statement.
It said male cheetahs had been used since the 1990s to control animals that stray onto the runways.
Cheetahs, the world's fastest land animals, are used as "a sustainable means of controlling wildlife populations that pose a hazard to aviation safety," the statement added.
The Hoedspruit Endangered Species Centre, an animal charity, said on its website that it had recently donated two cheetahs, Tobie, six, and Wim, seven, to the Makhado base.
But officials were unable to confirm if the pair had been identified as those involved in the attack.
The military described the attacks as "unprecedented" and started an investigation.
Warthogs, impala and antelopes are among the animals that can cause problems by wandering onto runways in South Africa.

Delimitation work: Faiszer requests more time

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha requested from the President and the Prime Minister to give him sufficient time to carry out the delimitation work in the correct manner.
He made this request addressing the 'All-Party Conference on Demarcation of Wards of Local Governments' at Grand Monarch Hotel in Thalawathugoda yesterday.
The minister said about 2,000 appeals have been received to the Appeal Committee on National Delimitation appointed by him on the instructions of the President and the Prime Minister.
He said going through all of them has become a strenuous task because of time restrains.
"If the delimitation was not done in the proper manner, fingers could be pointed at our officials and the government. The criticism leveled at the previous committee for delimitation was an example for that. I want to make sure that such criticism will not occur again," Musthapha said.
He also reiterated that the next Local Government elections should definitely be held under the new system.
"Some are still asking whether the next Local Government elections will be held under the old system or the new system. With the Amendments to the Act in 2012, the new system that elects 70 percent of the representatives from the wards system and the balance of 30 percent from the proportional representation system was established. Now we cannot revert to the old system," he said.
"During the previous elections we pledged to introduce a new electoral system sans of preferential voting system. We should hold the Local Government elections under the new system keeping with this promise. However, the delimitation issues must be solved before holding the elections. I request the support of all party representatives to carry out the delimitation in the correct manner. A summary of the content of all appeals received to the committee was presented to all party representatives.
Our aim is to resolve the issues pertaining the delimitation with the consensus of all of them," the minister said.
Musthapha presented the summary of appeals received to the Committee to President Maithripala Sirisena during the occasion.
The all-party conference was called following a request by Minister Kabir Hashim, who is also the Chairman of the Cabinet Subcommittee to inquire into the delimitation.
Representatives from all the registered political parties, officials of the Elections Commission, members of the Polls Observation Groups and district secretaries were invited for the conference.
Based on the agreements made at the all-party meeting and the inquiry report of the appeals, the delimitation is to be gazetted again by the subject minister.
Appeal Committee on National Delimitation Chairman Asoka Peiris said the report of the Committee is scheduled to be finalised by January 15, as Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya has requested a minimum of 56 days to make arrangements to hold the Local Government Elections.
However, he observed the task was complicated adding that there were about 500 appeals that they could not even open yet.
Peiris added there were some issues that exceed the mandate of the committee, but needed to be resolved before the elections.

IS finance chief killed in Iraq air strike: US

US: A coalition air strike killed an Islamic State finance chief in Iraq last month, the US military said Thursday, hailing it as another scalp in its bid to blow apart the extremists' financial network.
Abu Saleh was killed in late November, US military spokesman Colonel Steve Warren said in a videoconference from Baghdad, calling him "one of the most senior and experienced members" of the group's nefarious financial system.
"Abu Saleh was the third member of the finance network that we have killed" recently, Warren added, likening him to a finance minister for the extremist group, which grabbed swathes of Iraq and Syria in a brutal offensive of beheadings and forced religious conversions.
Abu Saleh was killed along with two associates as part of the US-led coalition's campaign to destroy the extremists' financial infrastructure, Brett McGurk, Washington's envoy for the anti-IS fight, said on Twitter.
Real name Muwaffaq Mustafa Muhammad al-Karmush, the US State Department's terrorist blacklist describes him as a 42-year-old Iraqi.
"Killing him and his predecessors exhausts the knowledge and talent needed to coordinate funding within the organization," Warren said, adding that two other henchmen in IS fundraising networks also were killed in coalition air strikes in Iraq in late November.
They were identified as Abu Mariam, an enforcer and senior leader in IS group extortion networks, and Abu Waqman al-Tunis, who Warren said coordinated IS's transfer of people, weapons and information.
Abu Mariam appears on the State Department terrorist list as Mounir Ben Dhaou Ben Brahim Ben Helal, a 32-year-old Tunisian.
"These strikes are an example of how we are able to decimate networks," Warren said.
The coalition has been targeting IS leaders in Syria and Iraq with air strikes to try to pick apart its command structure.
After the attacks in Paris last month, the United States said it was deploying a special operations unit in Iraq that will be able to mount raids into Syria to capture or kill IS leaders.
"We want this expeditionary targeting force to make ISIL and its leaders wonder when they go to bed at night: who's going to be coming in the window," US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter told a Senate hearing.
In London, the US Treasury's acting undersecretary for terrorism and financial crimes, Adam Szubin, said the IS group derives most of its funding from economic activity in the territory it controls and has declared a caliphate.
It has reaped more than $500 million in black market oil sales, looted bank vaults captured in Iraq and Syria, and raised millions more through extortion.
But to run what amounts to a mini-state, it needs steady and renewable sources of funding, and to do that it needs access to the international financial system to move money and import supplies, according to Szubin.

Geneva on alert as authorities search for Paris suspects

GENEVA: Geneva security officials have raised the alert level in the city and are looking for suspects in connection with investigations into the November 13 Paris attacks.
A security guard at the United Nations in Geneva said Swiss authorities were searching for four people believed to be in or near the city, which is close to the French border. Another guard said the UN compound was on maximum alert.
"In the framework of investigations carried out following the Paris attacks, at the international and national level, Geneva police and their partners are actively looking for people whose description has been provided by the Swiss Confederation," the Geneva department of security said.
Shooting and bomb attacks claimed by Islamic State killed 130 people in Paris on November 13. Police in several European countries are still searching for individuals believed to have been involved in the attacks or in their planning.
It was not immediately clear from the Geneva statement, however, whether the suspects were directly linked to the Paris attacks. A Geneva spokeswoman said she had no further comment.
UN security guards in Geneva, the European headquarters of the world body, were stationed with MP5 sub-machine guns at entry points for cars, a highly unusual measure at the sprawling complex near the French border.

ICC confirms Kusal's sample was taken during WI series not Pakistan

The ICC has clarified that Kusal Perera's positive sample had been taken on October 12, and not during the Pakistan series, as a Sri Lanka Cricket statement had earlier said. Perera was withdrawn from Sri Lanka's ongoing tour of New Zealand after being provisionally suspended on Monday, and is currently in Sri Lanka mulling his response to the ICC's Notice of Charge.
"The sample Perera provided in an out-of-competition test, which was conducted on 12 October 2015, was found to contain the presence of a Prohibited Substance (in the category of non-Specified Substances)," a statement on the ICC's website said.
SLC's original release had specified the "Recent Pakistani Tour" as the series in which Perera had provided the sample.
"Pakistan toured Sri Lanka in June and July. According to the ICC, Perera had actually provided the sample two days before Sri Lanka's Test against West Indies in Galle, where the wicketkeeper-batsman struck 23 runs, took three catches and effected two stumpings.

IOC chief Bach wants audits to combat corruption

LAUSANNE, FRIDAY: International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach on Thursday unveiled plans for sports federations to have their finances and governance audited in an effort to combat corruption.
The audits will begin in 2016 and will apply to all international federations which receive financial aid from the IOC.
"The audits will be led by independent organisations," said Bach, and will also include national Olympic committees and Olympic Games organising committees.
The move comes as world football's governing body FIFA and the IAAF, which controls track and field, are mired in corruption scandals.
On the ongoing FIFA crisis, Bach said he was encouraged by a range of reforms which should be adopted by the body's 209 federations next February when a new president to succeed the suspended Sepp Blatter will be elected.
"The reforms are definitely a great step in the right direction, if you look at them, finally there will be term limits (for presidents)," said Bach.
"So yes I think these reforms when they have been approved by the Congress are a basis."
However, in a later statement, the IOC added that they were concerned over the lengthy nature of the twin investigations being carried out by the US and Swiss judicial authorities into FIFA corruption.
"The IOC executive board welcomed the proposals by the FIFA Executive Committee for major reforms like term limits and other measures," said the statement.
"The IOC executive board remains concerned with regard to the ongoing criminal procedures in the United States and Switzerland, which according to these authorities could last for another five years.
"Since this could continue to overshadow the credibility of FIFA and affect all sport organisations for such a long time, the IOC executive board encourages FIFA to take all necessary measures to clarify and resolve all the pending issues as soon as possible by further engaging with the relevant authorities."

Is it a bird, or a 100mph delivery
DUNEDIN, FRIDAY: A low-flying seagull was blamed for interfering with the speed gun on Friday when New Zealand's Neil Wagner bowled a ball clocked at 160 kilometres (99.4 miles) per hour -- one of the quickest on record.
Neil Wagner
The surprise missile from Wagner, whose normal bowling speed is in the low 130s, lit up social media before the speed radar's operators said the reading may have been affected by a passing bird.
The left-arm seamer's ball came on a blustery day at Dunedin's University Oval when he was bowling to Sri Lanka's Dinesh Chandimal on day two of the first Test.
However, members of the television production team operating the speed radar said a bird had probably caused an inaccurate reading from one of two monitors at the ground.
The alternative reading was 133kph, more in keeping with Wagner's usual pace.
If Wagner did in fact send down a ball at 160kph, he would have been just a shade off Mitchell Starc's Test world record of 160.4, set last month in Perth.
The fastest recorded delivery is 161.3 by Pakistan's Shoaib Akhtar, nicknamed the "Rawalpindi Express", against England in a 2003 World Cup limited-overs match.
"If Neil Wagner is hitting 160km, then the drinks cart is doing 150km and West Indian cricket is nosediving at warp," quipped Twitter user @eld2_0.

Karunaratne, Chandimal lead Lanka fight back after early scare
DUNEDIN, Friday - Dinesh Chandimal and Dimuth Karunaratne spearheaded a gritty Sri Lanka fight-back on the second day of the first Test against New Zealand in Dunedin on Friday.
They came together with the tourists looking fragile at 29 for two, and put on 122 for the third wicket in reply to New Zealand's first innings 431.
Dinesh Chandimal of Sri Lanka celebrates his half-century during day two of the first Test cricket match against New Zealand at University Oval in Dunedin on December 11. Chandimal was unbeaten on 83 at the end of the day. AFP
At stumps, Sri Lanka were 197 for four with Chandimal on 83 and Kithuruwan Vithanage on 10.
Karunaratne was out for 84 after providing stubborn resistance with Chandimal, which was desperately needed after Sri Lanka failed to make the most of the conditions when they won the toss and sent New Zealand into bat.
With six wickets in hand, Karunaratne believed Sri Lanka were in a position to save the Test from what had been a very tough situation.
"We're slightly in a good position," he said, adding patience would be key. "The wicket is a bit slower than we expected and it's not turning much.
"It's two-paced and we have to wait for the loose ball and get runs."
But New Zealand quick Trent Boult thought there was still enough in the wicket to keep the advantage with the home side.
"It's going to be a big push in the morning. If we can get one early, the cliche of one brings two and we'll be into the tail," he said.
Boult saw signs of reverse swing developing "and that's going to become a big factor with four seamers that can all exploit that".
After the New Zealand innings wrapped up early on Friday, the outlook for Sri Lanka darkened when Test novices Kusal Mendis and Udara Jayasundera fell cheaply, both caught behind by BJ Watling.
But Karunaratne and Chandimal stepped up, curtailing their attacking instincts.
They delicately negotiated their way to bring up the 100 in the 45th over just before tea.
The middle session produced only 65 runs, but while the New Zealand bowlers sent down a series of dot balls they seldom looked threatening.
As the pitch flattened in the final session, Sri Lanka upped the tempo and cracked 48 in 13 overs before left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner made the breakthrough.
Karunaratne, a century-maker against New Zealand a year ago, had played patiently for 198 balls before he slashed at a drifting delivery and gave Watling his third catch.
- Low-flying bird -Skipper Angelo Mathews only made two before he added to Watling's collection and gave Tim Southee a 27th birthday present with the finest of edges to a bullet heading down leg side.
Umpire Nigel Llong said not out but a New Zealand appeal showed the faint edge picked up by the Hotspot technology and Sri Lanka were four down for 156.
Vithanage had a life five overs before stumps when he drove Doug Bracewell hard at Kane Williamson at short cover and was dropped.
Chandimal, who played a chanceless innings, has faced 208 deliveries for his 83.
When on one, he kept out a yorker from Neil Wagner which the speedgun clocked at 160 kilometres (99.4 miles) per hour -- close to Mitchell Starc's Test record of 160.4.
But the seamer has never bowled anywhere near that speed before, and officials suspected a low-flying bird caused a misreading.
Wagner was one of four wicket-takers with Trent Boult, Tim Southee and Santner also sharing in the dismissals.

LG polls possible before Sinhala and Hindu New Year - PM

The government expects to hold the Local Government election before the next Sinhala and Hindu New Year, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
The Prime Minister made this observation in response to a question by opposition MPs including Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake and MP Dinesh Gunawardane who asked as to when the Local Government election will be held. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the issues pertaining to the amended legislation on the Local Government election has to be resolved first before holding the poll.
He said there are issues with regard to delimitation and establishing wards. He added the officials demand at least one month for those matters.
"It is planned to hold the election before March 30," the Prime Minister said. "But, will give another weeks time and say before Sinhala and Hindu New Year. Then there is one more week for the preparations to the election," he said. MP Gunawardane said there is no need for any discussion or delay in holding polls in the 300 Local Government institutions across the country as the amendments have already been passed.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that the matter about the introduction of 25 percent womens' representation at the next Local Government polls would be decided at the discussion that was being held in Pelawatta yesterday.

Nishantha, Thilanga and Jayantha get greenlight to contest SLC presidency

The Objection filed against the nominations of Nishantha Ranatunga, Thilanga Sumathipala and Jayantha Dharmadasa for the post of president of Sri Lanka Cricket were overruled by a committee headed by Director General of Sports K. D. S. Ruwanchandra yesterday thus paving the way for them to contest the elections on January 3.
The fourth contestant for the post is Sumith Perera.
However the nominations of K. Mathivanan and Asanga Seneviratne for the post of Vice Presidents were rejected on the grounds that they had not served in the executive committee for a minimum period of two years.
On the same grounds Eastman Narangoda's nominations for the post of treasurer was also rejected. Mathivanan the Daily News learns may seek legal redress on the decision.
According to the constitution of Sri Lanka Cricket all contestants should have served a period of two years in the executive committee after been elected.
However those who have represented Sri Lanka in Test or one-day international cricket need not have served in the executive committee. Arjuna Ranatunga, Sri Lanka's World Cup winning captain has qualified to contest for the post of vice president on those grounds.
The disqualification of Narangoda for the post of treasurer leaves only Shammi Silva as the only contestant for the post.
However Silva is also contesting for the post of vice-president and it will be interesting to see which post he will finally settle for.
If Silva withdraws from contesting the vice-presidency Dharmadasa and Arjuna Ranatunga will be uncontested for the two posts of vice-president.

No excuses for 'bad boy' Guildford on road to redemption
Zac Guildford. AFP
SYDNEY, FRIDAY: Former All Black wild man Zac Guildford says there will be no excuses this time as he tries to resurrect his career with the NSW Waratahs after drink problems which he traces back to his father's tragic death.
The 26-year-old is raring to go again after joining Australia's 2014 Super 15 champions on a 10-month contract in September.
The winger is confident enough now to be giving media interviews in Sydney ahead of the new season starting in February.
"Can't say I'll never, ever drink again, but for the moment I'm pretty happy not doing it," Guildford told The Australian newspaper.
Personal tragedy struck in 2009 when his father Robert died of a heart attack watching from the stands as Guildford and his New Zealand team-mates won the Junior World Cup in Tokyo.
"It messed me up big time," Guildford told foxsports.com.au.
"I went from I guess jubilation and then five minutes later I found out that my dad passed away, and I'm looking in the stands and my mum's crying."
It set off a descent from World Cup heroics to serious alcohol problems and his sacking from the Canterbury Crusaders in 2014.
"I used dad's passing as an excuse for a long time... But I can't keep using it as an excuse until I'm 40," he said.
"I need to make my dad proud and play some awesome rugby and do well off the field."
- Naked brawl - SUB HEAD
Guildford first went to France but walked out of a contract with Top 14 side Clermont in May, citing "personal reasons".
It was Waratahs head coach Daryl Gibson -- his coach at the Crusaders -- who talked Guildford into a move to Australia to embark on a fresh start.
"It showed me that he wanted me as a rugby player and to be a part of an organisation, but also that he actually cared about me outside of rugby," Guildford said.
After the signing, Gibson acknowledged the winger faces a challenge to fit in after the tumultuous years.
"He's probably been carrying that 'bad-boy' baggage around with him for the past few years, and from my observations he has moved past it and grown up a bit," Gibson said.
Guildford played 11 Tests, debuting against Wales in 2009, and was a part of New Zealand's 2011 World Cup-winning squad.
Alcohol problems first emerged publicly during the tournament and just weeks later he had a meltdown in the Cook Islands, running naked into a bar and punching two men.
Then in January 2013 he allegedly became involved in a brawl at a party in Christchurch, prompting him temporarily to withdraw from rugby and seek help.
Now he says he is working to get his life back. The Waratahs kick off their season on February 27 against the Queensland Reds.
"I want to beat those Kiwi teams more than anyone," he told The Australian. "I can't wait. I'd play tomorrow if I could."AFP

Olympic Sevens: Sonny Bill Williams starts the rush for Rio 2016

The start of that journey for Williams - a little more than a month after lifting the Webb Ellis Cup  was to Dubai for the first event of the globe-trotting Sevens World Series. This is not one of six World Series events that Williams aims to play in. Instead he has cut short his off-season to meet his new team-mates and learn the seven-a-side game from the sidelines
Mike Henson
Sonny Bill Williams has won two Rugby World Cups, been named the best rugby league player in the world and won the New Zealand heavyweight boxing title.
But there is still a hole in his sporting CV. A hole that can only be filled by five big rings.
"Going back in time the best sportsmen ever have been Olympians," said the 30-year-old as he announced he would dedicate himself to being part of rugby sevens' debut at Rio 2016.
"Usain Bolt, Muhammad Ali, the list goes on. It's just an amazing opportunity to become one of those."
Sonny Bill Williams' sister Niall previously played for New Zealand's touch rugby side, but has made the transition to the full-contact version
The start of that journey for Williams - a little more than a month after lifting the Webb Ellis Cup  was to Dubai for the first event of the globe-trotting Sevens World Series.
This is not one of six World Series events that Williams aims to play in. Instead he has cut short his off-season to meet his new team-mates and learn the seven-a-side game from the sidelines.
And he is not the only 15-a-side star aiming to be part of rugby's new frontier.
Who might make the switch 
On his flight to the Middle East from Sydney, Williams bumped into Australia fly-half Quade Cooper, the pair tweeted pictures of themselves and grinned away in business class. Cooper was en route back to French club Toulon rather than stopping off in Dubai for the sevens. But he is determined to be on the plane to Rio.
His contract negotiations with Toulon's hard-ball president Mourad Boudjellal were long and laborious as Cooper successfully fought for the chance to play sevens for Australia alongside his club commitments.
When he lands in the south of France, Cooper might discuss his summer plans with new club team-mate Bryan Habana.
The Springboks leading try scorer, along with fellow World Cup stars Damian de Allende and Lwazi Mvovo, was invited to train with the South Africa sevens team in
November as coach Neil Powell considers whether to import 15-a-side specialists into his Olympic side.
Quade Cooper, Sonny Bill Williams and Bryan Habana have all set their sights on a Rio sevens spot
Cooper's international team-mates Bernard Foley and Israel Folau have opted for short stints in Japanese club rugby and will make a decision on whether to try their hand at sevens when they return early in 2016. Winger Henry Speight, also part of the Wallabies squad at the World Cup, has already made the switch and is in the Australia squad for the Dubai event.
Flanker Liam Messam - another of the All Blacks World Cup-winning squad - has joined Williams in focusing solely on sevens this season.
And Argentina winger Santiago Cordero - one of the stars of the Pumas' run to the World Cup semi-finals - is likely to be part of their Rio effort after signing a central contract with his country.
Montpellier flanker Fulgence Ouedraogo and Castres winger Remy Grosso helped France secure their place at Rio in the summer before joining their country's Rugby World Cup squad.
All those format flip-floppers will have to contend with sevens specialists, men who understand the game's cagey, contact-averse tactics and lactic-heavy physical demands.
What of Team GB
Wales wing George North has mused on the possibility of joining cyclist girlfriend Becky James in a British Olympic team.
Danny Cipriani is interested in being involved after his maverick talents were deemed surplus to England's World Cup requirements.
Full-back Stuart Hogg's electric running and courageous tackling for Scotland would surely transfer well to the seven-a-side game.
The names come easily. The reality is more complicated.
Great Britain qualified for Rio 2016 on the back of England's top-four finish in last season's Sevens World Series and the team will be made up of the best players from England, Scotland and Wales at Rio.
However, the chances of recruiting 15-a-side superstars to concentrate on sevens - as Williams has done - is a non-starter for Team GB as they don't have central contracts, while clubs are understandably keen their employees focus on their well-paid day jobs.
English club Wasps have indicated that they - and the rest of the Premiership - will adhere to the regulations and only release players two weeks before the tournament.
Barring an unforeseen bout of Olympic enthusiasm from clubs in the midst of trying domestic and European campaigns, Great Britain coach Simon Amor is likely to have to wait until the second-tier European Grand Prix Sevens series at least before he can welcome 15-a-side players into the fold.
The final leg of that series will take place in Exeter on 9-10 July and Great Britain are hoping their involvement will be confirmed before the end of this year.
Amor will then be faced with the unenviable task of condensing players from three different nations and two different formats into one team in less than a month.
Another gender, another planet
What Amor would give for the access that Simon Middleton, coach of Great Britain's women's team, has to 15-a-side specialists.
A week after England won the Women's Rugby World Cup in August 2014, the Rugby Football Union - mindful of the funding that potential Olympic medals bring to women's rugby - handed 12 of that squad and another eight players contracts to concentrate on sevens full-time.
Emily Scarratt, who scored 16 points in that 21-9 World Cup final win over Canada, is captaining England in Dubai, with another five of that historic squad also involved.
A Great Britain select seven - including Scots Steph Johnston and Megan Gaffney - also played in an invitational tournament running alongside the main Women's Sevens Series event.
Whoever is picked for Rio though, New Zealand will be overwhelming favourites for gold.
They have won all three of the Women's World Series titles since the it was introduced in 2012.
This season, they have a new recruit with Niall Williams, sister of Sonny Bill, who made her debut in Dubai. BBC

[Parliament]-12.12.2015

Twenty five pc LG elected representation to comprise of women - Prime Minister
Sandasen Marasinghe, Irangika Range and Ishara Mudugamuwa
Twenty five percent of all elected representatives of Local Government institutions would comprise of women under whatever system the polls is held, assured Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
He said the motion related to this move would be presented in Parliament in January next year.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe made these observations after he informed the House that the Gazette Notification for amendments with regard to the 25 percent women representation was to be issued later in the day (yesterday). He said the change would bring in laws to make political parties nominate 25 percent of women candidates to a local body.
He made this observation yesterday when opposition members, including Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake and MP Dinesh Gunawardena inquired whether women representation was to be increased to 25 as a proportionate of the nominees or the members elected. They questioned so following Premier's statement on this matter.
The Premier in his response said the proportionate of elected women could range from 25 percent to 100 percent, while the men's maximum representation could be 75 percent.
However, Dissanayake said that it would be impossible to nominate 25 percent woman candidates under a ward system. He said a system of women only wards would have to be introduced to make 25 percent women representation a reality.
Premier Wickremesinghe stated that issues related to the system would be discussed at discussions to be held in Pelawatta yesterday (Friday).
MP Dinesh Gunawardena stated that such matters have to be debated in Parliament not at Pelawatta to which the Premier stated that it was discussed there as the Local Government Ministry is located there.
Premier Wickremesinghe commencing his statement said that the Cabinet of Ministers approved the increasing of women representation at the local government institutions to 25 percent.
"The women in the South Asian region join politics with family influences and it is some what impossible for others due to various factors such as social, economic and political," the Premier said. "But Sri Lanka which could produce the first woman prime minister as well as the first executive president, beats other countries in the region on this aspect."
He added that the UNP was interested in increasing women representation in politics. He added that former Parliamentarian Rosy Senanayake and Sudarshani Fernandopulle from the Woman Parliamentarians Association have worked hard on this issue.
"We promised to increase women representation at the last Presidential election," the Premier said. "So we have included the same in our programme to develop a new country within a period of 60 months. Now we have been able to accomplish the same," he said.
He said that the move would be discussed with party leaders in future and moved in Parliament in January. He requested all the members to support the move.

Former minister has no right to talk of ethics - Mangala
Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera said in Parliament yesterday, that a leading minister of the former government which destroyed the moral values of this nation for ten years, was today speaking about ethics and values and their talks are similar to a prostitute of a brothel praising virginity.
There had been many occasions where MPs have been fighting each other in the past. "We have instances of MPs resorting to fisticuffs, but it is the first time in the history of our Parliament where a MP was hit while he was speaking. We should take some disciplinary action against them. There are some ghosts of the Rajapaksa regime still haunting this Parliament. I apologize for the mishap that had taken place this morning because Foreign Ministry officials were not present in the official box during the time of the debate of the Foreign Ministry. I thought that the debate on the Foreign Ministry would commence at 1.30 p.m. and I asked the officials to be in Parliament at 1.30 p.m. I made a mistake and I do apologize for it. However, I will answer all questions raised by all members who participated in the debate in the morning, by going through the Hanzard report.
Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala said a pension scheme for migrant workers would be implemented from January next year.
Special welfare scheme too would also be established for their families shortly, she said.

'Programme to minimize number of domestic workers travelling abroad'
Minister of Women and Child Affairs Chandrani Bandara said in Parliament yesterday, that there would be a programme at provincial level to minimize the number going overseas as domestic workers.
The minister made these observations joining the Committee Stage debate on Budget 2016, under financial heads of the Ministry of Foreign Employment.
At present, the percentage of women going abroad as domestic workers had dropped. Many social and family problems had been created as a result of women migration for domestic work.
When a woman returns to her motherland, of most occasions, she has to face terrible situations in her home, such as a husband's erratic behaviour, addiction to drugs, womanising, smuggling, children's erratic behaviour and love affairs at a very young age, drop in education, addicted to drugs, raped and being abandoned by their guardians.
New laws were brought banning women having children less than five years of age from going abroad as domestic workers.
Deputy Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P Perera said a systematic plan should be formulated to minimize migration of women for domestic work within the next five years.
Jobs as housemaids are not suitable for Sri Lankan women and it is a black mark on our dignity, the Deputy Minister Ajith Perera said.

Members walk out over foreign ministry financial head
Joint opposition members led by MP Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday, walked out of the House expressing their displeasure over the objection of the financial head of the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardena joining the Committee Stage debate of the Budget under the financial heads of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, stated the the joint opposition would walk out of the House in objection of the financial head. He made this statement just before the speech of Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera commenced.
However, this incident took place following the sittings after the commotion in sequel to UNP MP Mujuber's speech.
The members were seen walking out of the House

'All ports maintained with Colombo Port earnings'
Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunge told Parliament yesterday, that all our ports are being maintained with the income earned from the Colombo Port.
He made this observation in Parliament in response to a question for oral answers raised by UNP Parliamentarian Buddhika Pathirana.
The Oluvil and Hambantota Ports are running at a great loss. We have cut down on all unnecessary costs at these ports. All the ports were filled with political appointees and we had to bear up extra expenses due to this reason.
We are now discussing several new projects for the Oluvil harbour and If they prove successful, there will be no financial problems.

'Foreign policy lost professionalism due to political interference'
Deputy Minister of Parliamentary Reforms & Mass Media Karunarathna Paranawithana said in Parliament yesterday, that the Foreign Affairs Ministry was enjoying greater freedom since the January 8th revolution.
During the previous regime, Sri Lanka's foreign policy had gradually lost its diplomatic professionalism, largely due to party political interferences and appointment of too many politicians, and henchmen of government leaders as high commissioners or ambassadors to important countries.
Sri Lanka's foreign policy had been messed up and muddled to such an extent during the previous regime, that we had to face the biggest international diplomatic crisis. Today, a conducive environment had been created at the Ministry, enabling employees to work freely without political interference.
During that period, many countries were hostile to Sri Lanka as a result of our belligerent attitude towards them. Today, several countries who were opposed to us earlier, have now supported our position.
We have initiated a process of national reconciliation. We will be having a domestic mechanism to probe accountability issues and march towards reconciliation.
There is no threat to national security, but communalism is in danger. We request Foreign Ministry officials to educate the international community of our reconciliation in Sri Lanka.
UPFA MP Namal Rajapaksa said that this is not a Asia-centered foreign policy pledged by President Maithripla Sirisena, but a Western-centered policy.
The Geneva Resolution are the causes to threats to our unitary states and the integration and it has not been approved by the Cabinet or Parliament.

Geetha bats for Lankan woman
Opposition UPFA member Geetha Kumarasinghe was involved in a cross talk with another member during her speech when the latter interrupted her.
Geetha Kumarasinghe said that measures should be taken to free the Sri Lankan woman who is sentenced death in Saudi Arabia, referring to the modus operendi followed by the Indian Government in a similar situation.
"India's late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi said the Indian Government would imprison 100 Saudi Arabians working in India if the Indian woman would not be freed," Geetha Kumarasinghe said. "She also said that steps should be taken to stop Sri Lankan women going abroad for employment."
At this stage, a member was heard querying on the mike if this could be applied to us as there are around 500,000 women employed in Saudi Arabia. "You should keep quiet as a male member. I am speaking here on behalf of the Sri Lankan women. Only women are stoned in Saudi Arabia," Kumarasinghe said. "Men are not stoned there. I am representing the women, you keep quiet and resume your seat."
However, her allotted time had expired and she had to wind up her speech.

Country gained positive Int'l recognition - Mahinda Samarasinghe
Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training Mahinda Samarasinghe told Parliament yesterday, that our country had gained positive recognition among the international community and we should make use of it to become an active member of the international community.
We have come back on to the right track again.
This situation has changed with the acceptance of our President by the international community.
There was much lsupport from the international community. Resolutions were brought against us in international forums.
Today this situation has changed. We should stand up as a nation that protects human rights.

Three months leave approved for Lands Minister Gunawardena
Lands Minister M K A D S Gunawardena was granted leave by Parliament for three months yesterday.
Presenting a motion yesterday in Parliament, Chief Government Whip and Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Gayantha Karunathilake moved before Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala, that MKADS Gunawardena be given three months leave. Leave was granted accordingly for three months from December 11.

New laws leading to banning of hate speech, communal violence presented to Parliament
Chief Government Whip Minister Gayantha Karunathilake yesterday, presented to Parliament new laws that would lead to the banning of hate speech and instigating communal violence.
The Bills titled Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) and Penal Code (Amendment) would be taken up for debate on a future date.
The Bill sought to amend the Penal Code said: "Whoever, by the use of words spoken, written or intended to be read, or by signs or by visible representation or otherwise, intends to cause or attempts to instigate acts of violence or religious, racial or communal disharmony, or feelings of ill-will of hostility between communities or different racial or religious groups, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years."
The Bill seeking to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure would make provisions for sentencing two year imprisonment for "causing or instigating acts of violence or religious, racial or communal disharmony or feelings of ill-will or hostility by use of words spoken, written or intended to be read, or by signs, or by visible representation or otherwise."
The person violating the laws would be arrested without a warrant. The offense is bailable and should be referred to a Magistrate's Court, the Draft Bill said.

No agreement without Parliament approval - Harsha
Responding to JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva said that the President, Prime Minister, Foreign Minister or any other authority had not come to any agreement with any country arbitrarily without the approval of Parliament.
He made this response joining in the Committee stage debate on Budget 2016 held yesterday for the 8th allotted day under the financial heads of Foreign Affairs Ministry and Foreign Employment Ministry.
Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva said that due to the policies of the present government, Sri Lanka had been refuted by many countries in the world. The foreign policy of the present government is "Friendship Towards All." Through this policy, we are hoping to deal with all countries in the world in a friendly manner.
The Deputy Minister also stressed that nobody had maintained international relations by-passing the Foreign Ministry.
Budget 2016 had allocated Rs. 9,469 million for the Foreign Ministry. Only Rs.1,375 million from that amount is used for local expenses and Rs. 8,097 million allocated for Embassies, High Commissions and foreign missions to improve the country's image in the international arena.
Though the previous government had spent millions of money by even getting additional funds from the Treasury apart from budget allocations, they had not succeeded in improving the country's negative image. It turned worse day by day.
The combination of the country's foreign policy and its economic policy to get the maximum use of international market opportunities to increase the country's GDP and uplift the living standards of people, is the main challenge that we are facing today. To do that, we are following the policy of economic diplomacy.
"As the first step to economic diplomacy, we motivated foreign missions to make the international community aware of the country's real situation. Discussions are currently on with regard to the GSP plus. We hope that we would be able to regain the GSP plus concessions by 2016." the Deputy Minister said.

Priyanka Chopra voted 'Sexiest Asian Woman' in UK poll

UK: Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra beat off global competition to retain her title as the "Sexiest Asian Woman" in an annual UK poll.
The singer and actress, 33, came out on top following millions of votes pouring in from across the globe on social media for the 2015 edition of the popular '50 Sexiest Asian Women' poll conducted by London-based weekly newspaper Eastern Eye.
"Now that's a title I'm happy to hold on to. I'm bringing sexy back! A big thank you to everyone who's voted for me. Thank you also to Eastern Eye for making me feel 'sexy'; well, at least for another year. A piece of advice to the ladies - it's all in the mind. Remember, sexy is as sexy does," said Chopra.
This is the third time in the past four years that Chopra, who has been making waves with her role as an FBI recruit in American television thriller "Quantico", topped the list. The win rounds off a dream year for the former Miss World, which includes winning all-round praise for her 2014 film "Mary Kom" and 2015 box-office hit "Dil Dhadakne Do".
"Priyanka Chopra is doing India proud on the global stage and winning loads of admirers. This was illustrated by the largest-ever number of votes by non-Asians that she received from all over the world.
"She is clearly building bridges internationally through her art and will continue to do so in the coming years. And by excelling in TV, film and music, the multi-talented actress has shown just how far hard work can take you," said Asjad Nazir, Eastern Eye entertainment editor and founder of the list.
The mass interest in the list, now in its 12th year, was such that it was trending on Twitter across India and Pakistan during the voting process.
Popular television actress Sanaya Irani rose one place from last year to come second and fellow small screen star Drashti Dhami took third spot. - PTI

Putin orders Govt. to sue Ukraine if defaults on debt

RUSSIA: President Vladimir Putin ordered his government to sue Ukraine if the ex-Soviet republic defaults on its USD 3 billion (about 2.7 billion euros) debt to Russia.
"Go ahead, take it to court," Putin told Finance Minister Anton Siluanov at a government meeting while discussing the loan given to former Kremlin-backed President Viktor Yanukovych in 2013, which must be repaid this month.
The dispute has been hampering the International Monetary Fund's USD 17.5-billion rescue plan for Ukraine, which restricted Kiev's ability to restructure billions of dollars in debt, including some held by Moscow. Both Siluanov and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev had previously called for Moscow to sue Kiev in the event it would default on its payment.
In a televised interview, Medvedev said he thought Moscow and Kiev had "almost no chance" to come to an agreement on the outstanding debt.
"But we will keep trying to reach an agreement until the very end of December," Medvedev added.
The Kremlin said it had made its last offer to Ukraine on restructuring its debt but that its offer had been rejected.
Russian President Vladimir Putin last month said Moscow was ready to spread out the repayment over three years after initially demanding that Kiev make good on the full amount by late December. Meanwhile the IMF yesterday changed a rule that would have blocked its financial aid programme to Ukraine in the event the country defaulted on its debt to Russia.
Until now, the IMF could not provide financing to a member country that was in arrears to an official creditor, such as a government. Moscow blasted the IMF decision, saying it enabled Ukraine to miss debt payments to Russia without impacting its bail-out programme.
Siluanov called the decision "hasty and biased" and deplored that it legalised the possibility of Kiev defaulting on its debt.

Strong sponsors for Kandy SC

Strong backing by sponsors helps keep Kandy Sports Club moving forwards with many victories. Kandy SC are the defending inter-club champions who will once again be sponsored by Cargill's Food City, Sri Lankan and Etisalat.
The sponsors should be proud of the club's achievements. Started in 1950, in the period between 1995 and 2012 the club did not lose a single Clifford Cup title, although in 1998 there was no tournament and in 2006 the club withdrew from the tournament. Kandy SC has won the league title for a record nine consecutive years between 2000 and 2009.
The crowds at the venues as well as live TV coverage have no doubt given the much needed exposure to the sponsors. Rugby at club level draws more spectator interest than cricket.
Etisalat's association with Kandy SC has helped them in a big way. Kandy SC captain Fazil Marija said: "We sincerely thank Etisalat for their kind sponsorship and we look forward to deliver an unforgettable performance to make our sponsors proud."
Cargills (Ceylon) PLC are once again the platinum sponsors of the champion outfit and Singer Sri Lanka, the long standing sponsor.
Ransilu Jayatilake does Kandy proud in Canada
Ransilu Jayatilake who represented the country at the Commonwealth Power Lifting Championship has pocketed six gold medals and silver in the two-day event. He is the first Sri Lankan to achieve 700 kgs mark in Power Lifting and the first to lift 300 kgs in weightlifting.
Ransilu started his power lifting career at the age of 13 and was coached by his father D.U.M. Jayatilake. Ransilu's iron sport started at Kandy SC gymnasium when his father was in charge.
Kandy Club Football inactive
With the Kandy Club football in the doldrums some of the football lovers who are starving without proper football in Kandy have come forward to play a game between a team from Kandy and Colombo on invitation.
They plan to come out with a trophy named as M.E. Marikar and William Weerasinghe trophy. M.E. Marikar, a product of St Sylvester's was a top class footballer during his days. He also played for the school, Kandy Schools, Young Stars SC, Kandy District, Saunders FC and led the Government Services XI in 1956. Later he was a great football promoter as an official and journalist.
William Weerasinghe who hails from down South studied at Dharmaraja College and later played football for the school and Young Stars SAC. He was one time treasurer and Vice President of the Kandy District Football Association.
The two teams will comprise some of the top players in the country and the trophy and the match expenses will be borne by former FFSL president Manilal Fernando.
S.N Ranaweera, best all-round sportsman Trinity Junior
Swimmer S.N. Ranaweera was chosen as the best all-round sportsman of Trinity College Junior School for the year 2015 and was presented with a trophy donated by Herbert L. Fernando in memory of one time Trinity rugger and hockey player and later rugger coach Quentin Israel.
Swimming
Kandy product Shehan de Silva who learnt his swimming at Trinity College was adjudged as the champion swimmer for the second year at the 41st national sports festival which was held at the Sugathadasa Stadium swimming pool and organized by the Ministry of Sports.
Rugby Referees to be trained
One of the finest referees to come out of Kandy Anil Jayasinghe, who has blown over here and overseas, is to give a helping hand to promote referees.
He is keen to conduct classes for referees twice a month, and teach them the finer points of refereeing.
What has happened to Ladies Cricket Club
The question in Kandy among the cricket loving ladies is what has happened to the recently-formed Kandy Ladies Cricket Club that took part in hard ball cricket and played in the tournament organized by the Sri Lanka Women's Cricket Association. The first game they played in this tournament was against Colombo Colts Ladies team at the Moors grounds.
The team led by Swini de Alwis comprised Chamara Polgampola, Dilani Manodara, Prabha Udawatte, Mahesha Perera, Sandamali Jayasundara, Nisansala Dharmawickrema, Nirmala Bowatte, Sripali Weerakkody, Subadhra Kumari, Nalika Samaranayake, Sandamali Karunaratne, Niluka Amarasena, Sandya Kumari, and Chandima Abeywickrema.
Will this club like the men's clubs remain inactive and only start playing matches when the AGM is around the corner
Women's Basketball
Kandy' Basketball team led by Ravini Dissanayake and comprising Nethmi Wijesinghe (vice-captain), Dulma Jayamanne, Sachini Dulangani, Nirasha Beddegama, Dilanak Silva and C,. Harini gave a superb display of basketball to beat Kandy YMCA and take top position in the Kandy District women's basketball tournament which was organized by the Kandy District Basketball Association.
This is one sport both in the men's and women's that are doing well. Veteran of the game D.S. Pingamage is the one responsible for keeping this game alive.
When will KDCA AGM take place
When will the AGM of the Kandy District Cricket Association (KDCA) be held This is the talk among the cricket playing clubs in Kandy. It is high time they call for the AGM and hold it before the Sri Lanka Cricket AGM. The secretary of the KDCA should take the blame for not doing a proper job. Today in Kandy at club level there are no domestic tournaments and also the game is not promoted in the correct manner. The last KDCA AGM was held in 2013. From that day onwards no AGM has been held, but the same people are holding office.
Duncan White remembered
The late Duncan White, who was born on 1 March 1918 and departed on 3 July 1998, was remembered in Kandy. He is an athlete who has left an indelible mark in Sri Lanka's sporting history. White was the first Ceylonese athlete to win a medal in an Olympic event.
He won silver in the 400-metre hurdles at the 1948 Summer Olympics in England. He was also the only South Asian to have won an Olympic medal in track and field at that time.
White though he was born in Lathpandura near Kalutara, was educated at Trinity College, Kandy where he was awarded 'Trinity Lion' for athletics.
This was subsequently withdrawn from him due to minor disciplinary reasons. He won his Olympic medal the same year Ceylon gained independence from Britain. He was awarded the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1949 but only many years later in 1988 was he honored by his country of birth with a postage stamp.

Turkish President praises Zuckerberg over pro-Muslim message

TURKEY: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday praised Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for emphasising the difference between Islam and terror, after the billionaire social network tycoon posted a message defending Muslims against discrimination.
Erdogan, who once threatened to ban Facebook in his country, used his official page on the website to respond to Zuckerberg both in Turkish and in English.
"I highly value Mark Zuckerberg's message for pointing out the profound difference between Islam and terrorism since these two concepts are often mentioned in the same breath these days," he wrote.
"As I always express on different platforms, Islam is a religion of peace. Murderous networks that abuse Islam for their self-serving goals are massacring innocent people every day, particularly Muslims."
In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Zuckerberg said that the Muslim community should not have to fear being "persecuted for the actions of others" following attacks in Paris and elsewhere carried out by Islamic extremists.
"If you're a Muslim in this community, as the leader of Facebook I want you to know that you are always welcome here and that we will fight to protect your rights and create a peaceful and safe environment for you," he said.
The supportive message came just days after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump caused international outrage by demanding a ban on Muslims travelling to the United States.
Erdogan, who was elected president last August after ruling Turkey as premier for over a decade, has in the past made no secret of his disdain for social media, vowing to "eradicate" Twitter ahead of local elections in March 2014.
The government blocked Twitter and YouTube days before March 2014 local elections after they were used to spread a torrent of audio recordings implicating Erdogan and his inner circle in an alleged corruption scandal.
