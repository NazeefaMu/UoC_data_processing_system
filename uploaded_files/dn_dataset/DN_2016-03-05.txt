Agreements with foreign investors will not affect national security: Arjuna
National security will not be in jeopardy when developing the country, Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said.
He was speaking at a meeting at the District Secretariat Auditorium in Trincomalee on Thursday.
The minister said the government will give priority for the country's legal procedure and proceedings when considering any agreement with foreign investors.
"It does not matter if they come from Singapore, China, Japan or Ethiopia," the minister said. The meeting was held to discuss issues pertaining to lands owned by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority in Trincomalee district. It was discussed to extend legal rights of these lands to the people who have settled and have been living there for several years.
Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan also attended the meeting.
"The country's development projects should depend on the government's policy instead of personal interest. Foreign investment plays a significant role in the developing process of a country. We have to demand them to obtain the targeted economic growth," Sampanthan said.
"Singapore mainly depended on foreign investment when carrying out their development projects in 1980 but we never obtained them for the country at the same period. Hence, Singapore achieved their development targets while we lost. The time has come to learn lessons from Singapore and welcome appropriate foreign investments to the country at the same time, confirming and safeguarding national security. We should think beyond traditional ways and means," the Opposition Leader said.
Ranatunga said that the expectation of everyone was to develop this country as one nation.
"The Unity Government is implementing its development plans. It is up to the people to support the government's effort. The President or the Prime Minister would never engage in any activity which will have a bad impact on national security. The Opposition Leader is also of the same view," he said.
The attraction of the investors to the country would depend on government policies and the law applies to them. Politicians in the previous regime was concered of their own benefits and personal interests when they considered investors to the country, Ranatunga said.
"The Hambantota Harbour is a good example. I would never allow any investor to enter the country avoiding legal procedures. The rule would be the same with regard to the procedures of the Ports and Shipping Ministry. We saw a completely different practice followed by the previous regime on investors. Hence, today many in the previous regime have been summoned before the law," the minister said.

Arsenal title hopes hit as Cech faces lengthy absence
LONDON, FRIDAY: Arsenal's hopes of capturing their first Premier League title in 12 years took a huge hit on Friday with news that goalkeeper Petr Cech faces up to a month out injured.
The Czech Republic international suffered a muscular problem at the end of Wednesday's 2-1 loss at Swansea City.
That reverse left the Gunners six points below Premier League leaders Leicester City in third place, ahead of Saturday's trip to second-placed Tottenham Hotspur.
Cech's absence confirmed by manager Arsene Wenger at a press conference on Friday thrusts Colombian World Cup goalkeeper David Ospina into the spotlight.
"(He will be out for) three to four weeks," the Frenchman said.
"It is not more serious. It is a serious calf injury and he had a groin alert on the first goal and he could not kick the ball properly out because of his groin and maybe compensated a little too much and provoked another muscular injury."
Former Chelsea star Cech injured his calf as he raced back towards his own penalty area after coming up for a corner against Swansea.
Wenger revealed that Cech had a groin issue before the game but trusted him to play only to see his first-choice goalkeeper pick up a different injury.
The same happened with Alexis Sanchez earlier in the season when Wenger played him against Norwich despite knowing of a hamstring problem which then flared up in the game and ruled him out for the festive period.
"We had to make the decision before the game because he had a little groin problem but he declared himself 100 per cent fit," he said.
"Then you have to trust the player. He's 33 years old and he knows his body. If he says he's fit then he is available.
"It is like it is. I focus on the future. You want the players to be tough enough to sometimes be able to play through a little pain. You're never completely perfect before a game in March."
Ospina will deputise for Cech at Spurs and in the coming weeks - with an FA Cup replay at Hull and a Champions League tie in Barcelona to come as well as league games against Everton and Watford.
The Colombia international came in for criticism after a howler in the Champions League defeat to Olympiakos earlier this season but Wenger has backed his man to step up now he is needed.
"I have complete confidence in David and I'm not worried at all on that front," he added.
"If you look at the win-rate of Ospina it is very good as well.
I'm not worried at all on that front."

ECB chief Giles Clarke to explain role in ICC takeover to MPs
Giles Clarke, the England and Wales Cricket Board president, will be summoned to answer questions by the Commons culture, media and sport select committee over his role in the controversial "Big Three" takeover of the International Cricket Council.
Clarke, the former ECB chairman, was central to the reforms in early 2014 that led to India, England and Australia taking greater control of cricket's governing body and allocating themselves 52% of revenues generated by international events.
With the select committee having spoken to Greg Dyke, the FA chairman, over Fifa corruption, the athletics chief Sebastian Coe and Chris Kermode of the ATP on the subject of match-fixing in tennis, it will now turn its attention to cricket's governance.
"The committee has decided to look into the conduct of the ECB in relation to the governance of international cricket, in the context of the other investigations it is undertaking," a spokesperson said. "The committee has already looked at football, athletics and tennis, as part of a wider group of investigations into sports governance and, in relation to cricket, the ECB is an obvious choice to call in."
Damian Collins, the Conservative MP for Folkestone and Hythe who sits on the select committee, has also emailed the ECB chairman, Colin Graves, about the ICC issue, having been part of a protest outside The Oval by the Change Cricket campaign last summer.
Shashank Manohar, the new ICC chairman, has already vowed to review the 2014 restructure before the annual conference in June, with Collins now asking Graves how he and the ECB envisage change.
"This is a crucial moment for cricket," Collins said. "We have put six key questions to the ECB, because the cricketing public deserve to know how their game is being run.
"England, along with India and Australia, are the most influential boards at the ICC. In August I accused them of orchestrating a back-room power grab that saw these three countries taking over the game at the expense of the other 102.
"We welcome the news from the recent ICC board meeting that the ICC is considering governance reform but we want to know what the ECB thinks that reform should look like.
"It is hugely important that cricket does not miss this opportunity to embrace meaningful reform, and that the ECB are at the forefront of ensuring that the international game gets the independent, transparent and accountable governance it deserves. And if the ECB disagrees, we need to know why."
Collins' email to Graves was sent last week before a special screening of Death of a Gentleman at the House of Commons on Monday night, the award-winning documentary by filmmakers Sam Collins and Jarrod Kimber that charts the so-called "Big Three" takeover of the ICC.
"The England & Wales Cricket Board is aware of interest from the Select Committee for Culture, Media & Sport to look into the governance of international cricket," an ECB spokesman said.
"The Committee has already spoken to a number of sports bodies in their on-going enquiries into the governance of international sport and we would welcome the opportunity to talk with them in the coming weeks."

Forty Years of Reminiscing
All-Island inter-school cricket champions 1976 (winners of the Lifebuoy Shield) and a dedication to the men behind the scene 1975-1977
The Thomian team of 1976 led by right-handed opening bat and third year coloursman Sasi Ganeshan was unique in the sense that it consisted of six left-hand batsmen, four left-arm bowlers and four right-arm bowlers. The bowling armoury included a left-arm pacie Ishak Sahabdeen (later represented Sri Lanka at cricket and hockey) and a right- arm pacie Saliya Ahangama (who went onto represent Sri Lanka at cricket), two left arm leggies (Ajit Ganeshan and Lalith Ratnayake, a right-arm offie (Dayal de Silva), a right arm leggie (Suraj Dandeniya), right-arm medium pacer (Dayalan Subramaniam) and a left-arm dual purpose bowler Michael Jayasekera (who later represented Sri Lanka at rugby).
To add to it all the wicket-keeper of the side (the late Guy de Alwis) also went onto represent the Sri Lanka cricket team. Four members of a schools cricket team going on to represent the National side in three different disciplines of sport must surely be a record! The strength of the side was such that the selectors had no alternative but to leave out a coloursman from the previous year in naming the final X1. The side consisted of Sasi Ganeshan (Sas), Ajit Ganeshan (Aji), Lalith Ratnayake (Raty), Dayal de Silva (Daiya), Dayalan Supramaniam (Supps), Saliya Ahangama (Sali), Lakmaal de Zoysa (Laki), Michael Jayasekera (Miky), Ishak Sahabdeen (Ishy), Guy de Alwis and Suraj Dandeniya (Dan) with Pelham Jurianz, Arittha Wikramanayake, Githanjal Rajapakse and Ajith Amarasekera being the reserves. Its forty years this year since that bunch of cricketers performed their mighty deeds on the cricketing stage that belonged to Sri Lanka schools.
The team had somewhat of an inauspicious start to the season, with the skipper not being able to lead the team, due to a decision taken by the Warden. The unity that prevailed in the team and what was in store during the rest of the season was well reflected when the entire team walked into the Wardens office with a plea to change his decision. However the Warden stood firm, and Sasis brother who was the vice captain led the team to trounce St. Sebastians at Mount in the opener. The next game against Prince of Wales (POW) was washed off and having missed out on a certain win against Mahinda at Galle due to poor umpiring, the third term ended with another outright win against Zahira.
The first term commenced with an easy outright win against Thurstan followed by convincing wins against Nalanda, St. Sylvesters and Wesley. Unlike in the present era where over 20 matches are played during a season, only 14 matches were played in 1976 and the champion side won 6 of them outright and drew the rest, winning all matches on first innings other than against Ananda where the first innings deficit was a mere 6 runs that too as a result of a sporty declaration. This was in spite of having to take on the might of Trinity and St. Josephs with a depleted team in the absence of Ishy, Aji and Raty who toured Pakistan with the Sri Lanka schools U19 side for the Ali Bhutto Trophy. In fact the Trinitians were bowled out for just 82 runs in the first innings with two bowlers bagging five wickets a piece for 14 and 10. Incidentally, the following teams were shot out for less than 100 during the season:
St. Sebastians 83, Mahinda 86 (73 for 7 in the second innings), Zahira 26 & 57, Thurstan 57 & 94, Nalanda 81, St. Sylvesters 45, Wesley 91 and Trinity 82.
Ranjan Madugalle saved the day for Royal after being forced to follow-on. Having to get 130 to avert an innings defeat Royal were struggling at tea on the second day of the two-day encounter with the scoreboard reading 74/6. A rare missed opportunity off Ranjan soon after tea allowed Royal to get off the hook and manage a draw.
The Mustang Trophy limited-over encounter against Royal was won with ease. They were unfortunate to lose to St. Josephs by a mere 13 runs in the semi-final of the Exide Trophy limited over tournament that followed. Highlight of this match was the hurricane knock of 87 by Miky, the aforementioned dual purpose bowler, who was also an outstanding left-hand No 4 bat in addition to the skills he displayed on the field of rugby. He was unfortunately run out when in full cry and looking certain to carry the side to victory.
Even though the side produced three national cricketers, the following statistics (just three hundreds and only eight hauls of five wickets or more during the season) go to show that the team did not depend on individual performances but relied on sheer team work for success. Eight players averaged over 20 with the bat (two of them over 30), whilst five bowlers had averages of less than 15 per wicket (two of them less than 10)! But statistics do not always tell the whole story
Hundred or more during the season: Raty (100 n.o vs St. Benedicts), Laki (100 vs St. Sylvesters), Sasi (101 vs St. Peters)
5 or more wickets per innings: Ishy (7 for 19 vs Wesley & 5 for 7 vs Zahira), Daiya (7 for 39 vs St. Benedicts, 5 for 10 vs Trinity & 5 for 14 vs Mahinda), Sali (6 for 17 vs Zahira & 5 for 14 vs Trinity), Ajit (6 for 35 vs Mahinda)
The other aspect was that the side was led by a very positive captain who wanted to win every game and was willing to take calculated risks to achieve this. The moral and unity of the team was unbelievable and hard work was the key to success. The motto of this superbly knit, fun loving team was all for one & one for all. This was the motto of the three musketeers and certainly the deeds of this team will surpass those of the musketeers and the brave DArtagnan.
In the Observer schools all-island awards short listings the Lalith Ratnayake was among the top 10 selected to decide on the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in addition to being selected among the best 3 fielders. Saliya Ahangama and Dayal de Silva were also selected among the best nine bowlers whilst Sasi Ganeshan was one of the best 16 batsmen selected, in recognition of their performances during the season.
Although none from the team won individual awards, being awarded the Lifebuoy Shield as the best ALL ISLAND SCHOOLS CRICKET TEAM, was the richest reward and the pinnacle for the hard work during the season and the unity that prevailed within the team.
None of the above would have been possible if not for the focus and commitment of the Master in Charge Mr. Lassie Abeywardena, who virtually carried out the function of a coach as well. He encouraged every player to play his natural game with bat or ball and did not try to change batting techniques or bowling actions, which they were used to through proper guidance and coaching of coaches at junior levels, in the caliber of late Mr. Orville Abeynaike and the late Mr.George Ponniah. He emphasized the importance of fielding and concentrated in motivating the players to give 100% at all times.
The familiar shout of hey you monkey in response to a bad shot, a poor delivery or a fielding lapse, keeps ringing in the ears of players even after 40 years. Greats of yesteryear the late Mr. P.I. Peiris, the late Mr. Neil Chanmugam and Mr. H.S.M Peiris are others the team cannot forget for having spent valuable time in spite of their busy job schedules, to give the required guidance and encouragement.
In fact Lassie, Pipa, Neil and Holman as affectionately known to the team were involved with the Thomian teams from 1975-1977, during which 3 seasons STC had the proud distinction of winning outright against St. Sebastians (1976 & 1977), Moratu Vidyalaya (1977), Zahira (1976), Thurstan (1975, 1976 &1977), St. Benedicts (1977), St. Sylvesters (1976), Ananda (1975), Nalanda (1976), Wesley (1976 & 1977) and St. Peters (1977). What a stunning record! The only teams to escape outright defeats were Prince of Wales (play curtailed due to bad weather in all 3 years), Dharmapala (131 for 8 in their second essay needing 153 to avert an innings defeat in 1975), Trinity (managed a draw in 1976 after being all out for 82 in the 1st innings), St. Josephs (very lucky to escape certain defeat in 1975 due to a poor umpiring decision in the final over of the match when 9 wickets down), Royal (the lucky escape in 1976). STC did not lose a single match outright during the said three seasons and led on the first innings in all matches other than a couple.
This achievement is even more impressive given the opposing players during these years, such as Sidath Wettimuny, Thilan Wijesinghe, Piyal Perera (Ananda), the late Wirantha Fernando and Premalal Fernando (POW), Anura Ranasinghe, Yohan Goonasekera, Susantha Karunaratne, Hemantha Devapriya (Nalanda), Trevor Croner, Rohan Wijesinghe, Dushan Soza (St. Josephs), Dilrukshan de Alwis, Russel Kern (Wesley), Prasanna Kariyawasam, Ranjan Madugalle, Rohan Jayasekera (Royal), Reynold Anandappa, Angelo Wickramaratne (St. Peters), Rohan Perera, Ravi Ratnayeke (Trinity), to name a few.
Karuna and Karuppiah are also remembered for their dedicated services in the pitch/ground preparations, the support extended to every player and even carrying the common Kit bag with the players from college to the Mount rail station and back when the team was traveling outstation!
It is hoped that the College administration, current coaches and players make note of the following facts evident from the above achievements to produce champion Thomian cricket teams in the future.
The team was ably handled by the skipper Sasi Ganeshan who moulded them together and the ultimate goal of the team was more important than any individual. He was a replica of Mike Brearley of England who has a degree in people. Managing people is all that is needed. But Sasis batting was better than that of Mike Brearley. Even amongst the reserves there was a sense of cordiality and when three cricketers from this team left for Pakistan the replacements were there.
The late Guy de Alwis was an outstanding product who later went on to represent the country and got two half centuries in the 1983 World Cup. Ishak Sahabdeen has represented the country in three sports, namely Cricket, Hockey and Indoor Cricket. Saliya Ahangama came good in the series against India in 1985 and Mohamed Azharuddhin was his bunny. This team also had a unique feature in that two brothers were captain and vice captain of the team. This set of brothers played for three consecutive years and were captain and vice captain in 1976 and skippered in two consecutive years, namely 1976 and 1977. We hope that time does not erase the memory of this teams performances.
ESTO PERPETUA!

HONOURING OUR SAG GOLD MEDALLISTS
The Daily News from today will feature the 25 sports athletes who won gold medals at the recently concluded South Asian Games in India in a series of articles giving an insight to their life and career
Nimali Liyanaarachchi (womens 800m)
Nimali Liyanaarachchi
Nimali Liyanaarachchi who won the 800m gold medal at the South Asian Games (SAG) said that her aim is to break the Sri Lanka record in this event at the next opportunity and to qualify for the Rio Olympics in August this year. The Sri Lanka record for the 800m event is held by Dhammika Menike who clocked 2:03.85 secs at the Barcelona Olympics.
Nimali said that she was unable to break the Sri Lanka record because of lack of synthetic tracks in Sri Lanka which is hindering the progress of not only her but other athletes as well.
Nimali trains at the Nambadagaswewa grounds in Sooriyawewa and she brought honour to her country by winning a bronze medal in the 800m event at the Asian Athletic Championship which was the only medal won by Sri Lanka in athletic in that championship. When she was asked by former Sports Minister Naveen Dissanayake what she requires to improve her standard she requested for a modern track for Sooriyawewa.
Her wish was granted by the Minister when he allocated Rs. 2 million from the Ministry to build the building for the gymnasium and to improve the ground to a certain extent. She said she now trained at the new gymnasium in Sooriyawewa. She lost her father a few years ago and her mother R.G. Sriyani is a farmer in Sooriyawewa who spends for her nutrition with the meagre income she earns.
Nimali who is a Corporal of the Sri Lanka Air Force paid a glowing tribute to Sports Officer of Sooriyawewa Sujith Abeysekera for the support extended to her reach to reach this standard. She also thanked Capital Assurance Company, Ven. Assaji Thera of Gangarama and the District Secretary of Sooriyawewa for their guidance.
Indunil Madushan (mens 800m)
Ekanayake Mudiyaselage Indunil Madushan Herath who hails from a farming family near the Randenigala Reservoir did his village and country proud by winning the mens 800m event in a time of 1:51.46 secs at the SAG in India.
He was virtually in tears when the National Anthem of Sri Lanka was sung at the Indira Gandhi International Stadium, Guwahati by the Sri Lankan supporters because he was able to bring honour and fame to his motherland and for being able to make his poor father and mother happy. He started his education at Hasalaka, Andaganawa MMV and later shifted to Walala A. Ratnayake Vidyalaya which helped him in a long way to win medals.
Madushan started representing his school from the year 2000 in the 800m event and qualified to take part in the Youth Olympics and Youth Asian Games in Singapore. He had the honour of winning the bronze medal in the 800m event in a time of 1:56.00 secs.
After finishing his schooling he came to Colombo in 2011 and joined the Sri Lanka Army and won the 4x400m relay event at the Lucifornia Sports Festival. He also won three silver medals in the three Grand Prix events held in Thailand last year.
Madushan said his only ambition is to break the 800m Sri Lanka record and to qualify for the Rio Olympics this year. He said his mother, father and his coaches were a source of encouragement to help him achieve this feat.

Memories that made the 'Mother of all shows'
None even in their best of dreams would have thought that the then Royal College captain Ranjan Madugalle would go places in such grand fashion when he was adjudged the first-ever Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year some four decades ago.
Since then, the stylish middle order batsman who led the Reid Avenue school at the centenary Royal-Thomian cricket encounter way back in 1979, had achieved what a schoolboy cricketer could ever dream of - captaining his club NCC and Sri Lanka with distinction and finally serving as the Chief Match Referee of the ICC.
This is merely just one of the many classic examples of the world class star cricketers brought to the limelight by Sri Lanka's first-ever school cricket awards show. The galaxy of Observer Schoolboy cricketers include some of the greatest cricketers produced by the country - Arjuna Ranatunga, Muttiah Muralitharan, Sidat Wettimuny, Sanath Jayasuriya, Roshan Mahanama, Asanka Gurusinha, Marvan Atapattu, Kumara Dharmasena and Dinesh Chandimal to name a few.
But the entry of Sri Lanka Telecom Mobitel about a decade ago to boost the 'show of all shows' with a lavish sponsorship package took this great show towards new horizons. Since then, the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest has gone from strength to strength, inspiring the country's budding schoolboy cricketers to aim for the big league.
Sri Lanka's flagship English newspaper - the Sunday Observer, felt the need of recognizing the raw talent of the country's schoolboy cricketers at a time when there had been no organized inter-school cricket tournaments, other than the traditional first X1 matches of the so-called leading schools.
But the introduction of the show and its expansion to have a separate segment for the outstation schoolboy cricketers went a long way in inspiring the talented cricketers in the far flung areas.
The selection of one of Sri Lanka's greatest cricketers and the winner of the Most Valuable Player award in the country's 1996 World Cup triumph Sanath Jayasuriya as the Observer Outstation Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in the late 80s turned out to be a tremendous boost for players in the outstations.
During his last interview with the Sunday Observer on the event which initially brought him to the limelight at an awards show, ICC Chief Match Referee and former Sri Lanka captain Ranjan Madugalle said that it was a great source of encouragement for youngsters who aspire to become international cricketers.
"The Sunday Observer should be complemented for keeping the show going for all these years. Sponsors are essential to keep the show going. May the show continue for many years to come.
'In the past, most of the winners of the top awards came from Colombo and its suburbs, but now, the outstation schools have come in a big way and it is a positive sign for the game," he was quoted as saying.
Sri Lanka's World Cup-winning captain turned Minister Arjuna Ranatunga has been a regular guest at the event, since he had won the prestigious award on two occasions in 1980 and 1982.
"It is the dream of any schoolboy cricketer to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award. It's great for the Sunday Observer to conduct the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Contest for over three-and-a-half decades to encourage the budding schoolboy cricketers," says Captain Cool.
Year after year, the standard of the show and the enthusiasm it generates have gone from strength to strength. Its 'connection' with SLT Mobitel has been the key to the overwhelming response the show has attracted over the years. Chief Operating Officer of SLT Mobitel Nalin Perera has played a key role in supporting the Sunday Observer to take the show towards greater heights.
Based on the past success and tremendous response it has received from thousands of schoolboy cricketers across the country, voting for the 38th Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year most popular contests began a fortnight ago and is expected to reach its climax towards the end of the on-going First X1 season.
The Sunday Observer's initiative to recognize the achievements of schoolboy cricketers some four decades ago have brought rich dividends. The paper has been extremely happy to see several other awards shows following her example to reward outstanding schoolboy cricketers at the end of each season.
Yet, the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year remains the 'Mother of all Shows' and would continue to foster the country's next generation cricketers.

SLFPers in joint opposition will never quit party - Alagiyawanna
Megapolis and Western Development Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members in the joint opposition will never quit the SLFP to form a new party.
He was addressing the media at the Information Department, Colombo yesterday.
He added that most SLFP members in the joint opposition have pledged not to quit the SLFP to form the so called new party. "They do not want to be a cats paw of certain people of the minor and minority parties".
Alagiyawanna said that certain persons who gained various benefits from the SLFP and came to power with the assistance of the SLFP are trying to split the party for personal political gains. Whatever they say, it is clear that these persons can never come to power without the assistance of the SLFP and without being in an alliance.
"However, I am sure that the hardcore SLFP members in the joint opposition will never allow the party to be split" he said.
He said that the last UPFA government was liable for various forms of misconduct and malparactices including the destroying of democracy by implementing 18th Amendment to the Constitution and unnecessary mediation to courts and so on.
"These reasons resulted for the election defeats of the previous government," he said.
Central Province Transport, Power and Energy Minister Ediriweera Weerawardena said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has become a prisoner of certain politicians. "Mahinda Rajapaksa is being controlled by them," he said.
Southern Province Agriculture and Irrigation Minister U.G.D. Ariyathilaka said Basil Rajapaksa was accused by Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa as been the main cause for Mahinda Rajapaksa's election defeat at the Presidential election. However, both are trying to form a new party now.
Refuting allegations by the joint opposition that several weak persons have been appointed as SLFP organizers, he said that those appointees cannot be categorised as weak as they have rendered a dedicated service to the party for a long period.
He said the Party leader has the authority make new appointments.

Sri Lanka seeks bigger Haj quota this year
Sri Lanka has sought an increased Haj quota for the forthcoming Haj pilgrimage during a meeting between Haj Minister Bandar Hajjar and visiting Muslim Religious Affairs and Posts Minister M.H.A. Haleem in Jeddah on Thursday.

Haleem, who is leading a five-member delegation on an official invitation from the Saudi government, also met various government and private sector officials connected with Sri Lankan Haj operations in Makkah and Madinah.

The other members of the visiting team included Abdul Hameed Mohamed Fowzie, state minister of national integration and reconciliation; Mohammed Thaha Mohamed Ziyad, member of Haj Committee; W.G.R .Farook, head of Haj Travel Operators; and B.A.C. Mohammed Rameem, coordinating secretary.

Sri Lankan Ambassador in Riyadh Azmi Thassim and Acting Consul General M. S. M Ansar were also present at the meetings held in Jeddah, Makkah and Madinah.
Speaking to Arab News following the meeting Hajjar, Haleem said that this year Sri Lanka has requested for an increased quota from the current 2,840 to 7,000 pilgrims from Colombo.

Last year, we got a quota of less than 3,000 for Haj pilgrims because of development works in the Two Holy Cities. The island has more than three million Muslims and there are more than 8,000 applicants for Haj, he said.
The Lankan minister said his Saudi counterpart hinted of an increased Haj quota this year and that the country will soon be informed about it.

He said that Colombo needs an increased quota of pilgrims since the Muslims in the island are now free to travel in and out of the country following the end of the ethnic conflict .

We have successfully wiped out terror from the shores of Sri Lanka and formed a new government which advocates Yahapalanaya (good governance) under the able leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena, Haleem said, adding that the new president has categorically said that he would not allow racism to affect any minority communities in the island.

Sri Rahula College a fresher laden side
Sri Rahula College, Katugastota is one of Kandy's oldest cricket playing schools. They started the game in 1890's but gave up the game and were more involved in Football, Athletics and Hockey. However, again in the 1970's they returned to cricket and later they took to Rugby, and came on top at Mini Rugby. Sri Rahula was established, by the Buddhist Theosophical Society led by The American Colonel Henry Steel Olcott. It is one of the famous mixed colleges in Sri Lanka. The school was started as Kandy High School. This season, Sri Rahula with limited cricket facilities fields a fresher-laden side under the guidance of former S. Thomas' College, Combined Schools, University of Peradeniya, Saracens CC, Central Province and Sri Lanka President's XI cricketer Aubrey Kuruppu. He trains cricketers from a young age, to play good cricket and when they come up to under 17 level they are being snatched away by other schools. Most of the cricketers learn the finer points and later join other established schools.
The Rahulians are led by third-year player Jeevantha Wijeratne - left hand bat and a ff-spinner and Dilesha Madushanka - a fine right-arm leg-spinner is the vice captain. The other players who have done well at practices are Chamika Samarasekara, Malida Laithhewage, Darshana Ranaraja, Madushan Paranavitarane, Dilsh Krishantha, Gathika Wickremasinghe, Malith Rajapakse, Amila Wijesuriya, Ravindu Kapukotuwa, Dilsah Ambegedera, Parnda Kumaratunge, Sasuni Ranatunga, Madusha Thushara,
They play their big match against Waripayapola Sri Sumangala after a lapse of many years. Due to a misunderstanding the match was not played for a long time and today it is a one-day big match at Pallekelle Stadium.
Ahalya Rajan first lady to win golf double
Kandy's Ahalya Rajan, who hails from a well known sporting family, entered her name in the golf record books by becoming the first female golfer to pocket a double at the Donald Steel Golf Championship. She won the Pam Fernando and Victoria Bowl trophies. Ahalya's grandfather late P.T. Rajan was the man who introduced hockey to Kandy, and this lady took up to golf recently and her mother Jeewa, sister Gavri and Uncle B.D.R. Suri Rajan gave her the much needed encouragement to play golf.
Clifford Cup Knockouts
Defending champions Kandy Sports Club will play their first quarterfinals on Sunday March 13 against CH and FC at Nittawella in the Clifford Cup rugby knockout. If Kandy SC wins the semi-finals too will be played in Kandy at Pallekele or at Nittawela.
Why not in Kandy
Today the biggest spectators patronizing rugby at club level is in Kandy. At a game in Kandy there are nearly ten thousand rugby fans, which one does not find in Colombo. So, why don't the SLRFU play the Clifford Cup final in Kandy
Cricket Big match fever
Yet again, we are approaching the climax of another cricket season and the traditional Big Matches will be the focal point this month. The month of March is the time for the cricket loving public to revisit the good old days of school cricket. Stories of cricket heroics and the game's nostalgic memories re-emerge. While the youngsters take to the field keeping the good old tradition and take on their arch rivals, some call it 'cricket fever or big match fever'.
This 'fever' is said to have started when distinguished educational institutions, Trinity and St. Anthony's started a cricket rivalry called the 'Battle of the Blues' which is scheduled to be played this year on March 11 and 12. On the same day St. Sylvester's College will play Vidyartha College at Pallekelle International Stadium. The oldest big match in Kandy is when Dharmaraja play Kingswood on March 18h and 19 at Pallekelle International Stadium.
Udaya, Dishanka make Kandy proud at TT
Two of the top table tennis players hailing from Kandy, Udaya Ranasinghe of Vidyartha College and Dishanka Tennakoon of Dharmaraja College were selected to represent the country at the Perfect 2016 World Team Table Tennis Championship in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. These two players have given their best and won many tournaments and are sure to reach the top in the game.
E.W. Balasuriya Trophy for rugby
A trophy will be in offer for a game of rugby between Kandy Sports Club and another top class club in the next league season. It is a worthy cause because E.W. Balasuriya was a true lover and promoter of sport.
He started his own club Kandy Lake Club in the 1960's and gave a big hand for sports like cricket, Iron sport, cue sport and rugby. The first sport he introduced was cricket and later started playing rugby in the "B" division. In 1966 they emerged champions and in the following year 1967 were promoted to play in the "A" division. After entering the "A" division the club went places in rugby. But sad to say they were knocked out by the authorities of that era, for playing professional players. With that blow he formed the Kandy RFC and played up to 1973 and in 1974 amalgamated it with Kandy Sports Club.
Antonian rugby coach returns
Nihal 'Viper' Gunaratne who has come back as the rugby coach of his old school St Anthony's where he learnt the game and also led the side. He says this time he is all out to present a good team to play good quality rugby. Gunaratner played and led Kandy Sport Club, CR and FC and Sri Lanka. He is a level 3 IRB qualified coach. He was also one time coach/educator of the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union and has conducted courses for the rugby referees. He is also an Australian qualified coach. Priyantha Gunaratne is the under 16 coach and ace place kicker Nalaka Weerakody is in overall charge of coaching.
Rajans Rugby Day
Today is the second day of the annual Dharmaraja College rugby day, where a carnival atmosphere prevailed on the first day yesterday. In this rugby day, according to the chief organizer Saliya Alexander 58 matches are on the programme, students from year 6 to advance level are the participants. For year 6 to 9 it is a 10-a -side tournament, 9 to 10 a 12-a -side, advance level a 15-a-side and the most looked forward match of the event is the Present and Old boys game, where some of the top old Rajans are expected to scrum down.
This rugby day is sponsored by the old Rajans Rugby Football Association, and it is going to be a big day for the Rajan rugby lovers.
Sportswomen Chandra Ranaraja makes her last journey today
Former Hillwood College and Kandy sportswomen Chandra Ranaraja makes her last journey today, at 10 a.m. She passed away on Thursday morning and was one of the finest products of Hillwood College where she excelled in netball, basketball and lawn tennis. She was one time president of the Hillwood Old Girls Association.
Chandra was the first female Mayor of Asia (1990-91) (Deputy Mayor from 1979 to 1989) and also onetime member of the Kandy Municipal Council. During her time as member, deputy mayor and mayor she gave a big hand for sports at the Municipal Council.
She was at the forefront of a mission to make the Kandy people, especially the children, aware of the heritage that they have inherited as citizens of Kandy.
To this end she headed several committees and worked together with local government authorities, businesses, schools, sports personalities and professionals to bring all perspectives and ideas together to ensure that Kandy continues to thrive in its rich history well into the future.
She was the wife of late deputy minister Shelton Ranaraja who was a distinguished alumnus of S. Thomas' College Mt. Lavinia (with a stint at Gurutalawa).

Yorkshire tell Geoff Boycott they don't want him on the board
Geoff Boycott's hopes of joining the board at Yorkshire have found little favour with the club chairman, Steve Denison.
Boycott, a former Yorkshire captain and more recently president, has reportedly accrued sufficient nominations to be put forward as a prospective board member at the club's annual general meeting over Easter.
Denison has made it clear in a BBC interview he does not believe the former England opener's presence at committee level will be in Yorkshire's best interests.
Speaking on the day the club announced an annual profit for the first time in seven years, Denison cited the need for "stability".
Yorkshire, county champions for the past two seasons, are planning a multimillion pound redevelopment of the Football Ground stand to try to guarantee Test match status beyond the agreement with the England and WalesCricket Board, in place until 2019.
Denison told BBC Radio Leeds: "We want individuals with skills that can guarantee the survival of the club."
Members will be urged to look beyond Boycott when it is recommended at the end of this month that three new board members are elected.
"We are saying no on the back of stability," the chairman said. "The success we have had in the last two seasons has been on the back of a very stable board and a very stable management team, all pointing in the same direction."
Yorkshire retain significant existing debts, despite the annual profit of 368,000 and an increased income of 8.4m, and Test-match status is crucial to their well-being.
Denison has fond memories of Boycott in his playing days, when he became a hero for many, but will not allow that to affect his judgment. "He's a boyhood hero of mine - I invaded the pitch aged 13 when he got his 100th hundred at Headingley.
"But the problem we face at the moment is the club has been in serious financial difficulty for a long time, propped up by [the former chairman] Colin Graves.
"We need specialist skills on our board in relation to finance and construction, and that's the direction of the board over the next few years."
