Committee to look into appeals for delimiting - Faiszer

More than 400 appeals have been received for delimitation, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapa said.
He said the reason for receiving that many appeals was because delimiting does not occur in a proper manner.
"I have decided to hold an all-party meeting to discuss how to proceed with delimiting in a proper manner. That way all delimiting issues will be solved," he said. The meeting is scheduled to be held on December 11.
Minister Mustapa said that he had appointed a five member committee to inquire into delimitation issues. The inquiry into appeals began on the December 1.
The Commission is expected to summarize the appeals and present a report to the minister on December 15.

FUTA frowns at budgetary allocation for education

The Federation of University Teachers' Association (FUTA) members said they were disappointed with the allocation of 2.72 GDP on education by the budget as it does not provide balanced solutions to the distressing state of education in the country.
Addressing a press briefing, they said that although the education sector is in dire need of reforms, no provision had been provided in the budget to systematically analyze the problems and to develop a comprehensive policy for the sector.
They pointed out that although allocations have been made towards new degree programmes, little attention had been taken to address the problems of existing programmes of study. FUTA is concerned whether the new programmes will also be plagued with many of the problems that beset existing programmes, such as shortages in infrastructure, teachers and resources.
FUTA believes that viewing education as an industry and a market commodity, as described in the budget, will only harm the education system.
"These are disturbing trends and are an erosion of the principles of free education. This will only threaten the foundation upon which free education is built," FUTA President Dr. Primal Fernando said.
Furthermore, FUTA stated that the budget does not provide an encouraging environment for academics, and this could affect the recruitment of qualified staff to the university system.
Moreover FUTA lodged strong disapproval regarding the removal of vehicle permit granted to members of FUTA.

New look UPFA to contest LG polls - Amaraweera

A new set of political parties will join hands with the UPFA to contest the forthcoming Local Government elections, Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Addressing a press conference at the SLFP headquarters yesterday, the minister said among them were political parties representing Tamil and Muslim communities.
"President Maithripala Sirisena will lead the election campaign of the UPFA. The elections will be held under the ward system. Some in the UPFA claim they will contest separately. They are not a part of the UPFA in anyway," he said.
"One of them has challenged to relegate the SLFP to the fourth rank at the elections. If so, they must be having a secret understanding with the UNP. They prepared the ground for the defeat of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa by inciting racism. They did the same in the previous general elections. They must have taken up a contract of the UNP. They have a secret league with them," he said.
The minister said the UPFA would have a new look once the new groups are accommodated.
Responding to a question by a journalist, Amaraweera said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa would also help in the victory of the SLFP at the forthcoming elections as many local government representatives worked tirelessly for the campaign of Rajapaksa at the previous two elections.
He said the joint opposition may chose to take a different decision at the final vote of the Budget as many of their concerns have now been addressed.
Minister Amaraweera said the EU fish export ban would be withdrawn and that the GSP plus benefit would be regained by next year. "A EU team visited Sri Lanka recently to look into the lifting of ban. They stated that they would recommend to lift this ban as the country has reached the stipulated standards," he said.

US training for Sri Lankan forces - President
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday, stated that USA had expressed willingness to offer military training to members of the Sri Lanka's Security Forces.
He added that this opportunity could be gained following discussions with American President Barack Obama, US Secretary General and the US Ambassador to Sri Lanka.
President Sirisena made these observations yesterday, joining the committee stage debate of the budget under Defence Ministry financial head.
The President stated that US training for members of Sri Lankan Security Forces had been deprived for several years.
He added that the government would take measures to enhance the quality of the Sri Lanka's Security Forces. He added that government had been able to increase the number of security forces personnel who are enrolled to the UN Peace Keeping Forces.

Police will provide quality service - President
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday stated that he appointed a committee to look into the necessities of the Police in order to make it a qualitative force.
He said the Committee consists of ministry secretaries, secretary, Law and Order and Southern Development Ministry being the chairman.
He made these observations yesterday, joining the Committee Stage Debate on the Budget under Defence Ministry finance head in a response to Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake who questioned the quality of the Police Service.

We released 38, while former regime released 12,000 hardcore detainees - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliamnet yesterday, that one should compare the charges against 38 LTTE suspects released by the incumbent government and the 12,000 LTTE suspects released by the previous government to understand which group was more dangerous than the other.
"Who is more dangerous Is it the 12,000 LTTE detainees released by the previous government, or the 38 LTTE suspects released by the present government Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe asked in Parliament.
He said that opposition MPs accused the government of releasing 38 LTTE suspects. But the previous government had released 12,000 LTTE suspects. "We could tally the charges against the 38 that we released and the 12,000 the previous government released and then find which lot was the most dangerous," the Premier said.
We should have solved our human rights issue within our own country. China, the US and India, all these countries helped us to end the war without harming civilians. Pakistan trained our troops, the US trained our troops. Without their help, we could never have won the war. These nations still help us in reforming the armed forces, he said.
"Who promoted racism Who incarcerated Sarath Fonseka Who killed Lasantha Wickramatunga, Nadaraj Raviraj Killing of MPs Raviraj and Maheshwaran helped strengthening the hands of Prabhakaran. Today there are patriots in their hundreds here. These are cardboard patriots.
These patriots have no substance. They are just like some ice cubes. If we throw them out they would melt away. We have not stopped the court cases against those who have been given bail.
"Mahinda Rajapaksa went to Geneva and betrayed our forces. Thereafter, the UN started investigating us. Who struck a deal with Prabahakaran before the 2005 Presidential elections Who gave funds to the LTTE after Foreign Minister Kadirgamar was killed Tell us of those deals too.
Without shouting of non-existing threats here, he said that opposition member's speeches at the committee stage debate on budget proposals under the Defence Ministry expenditure heading were nothing but beating of war drums.
"Tell me for whose sake you are beating war drums We do not have a war here. What do you propose With whom should we fight
Do you propose that we should join the countries currently bombing Syria because there is a war Or are you proposing that we should bomb Tamil Nadu for sending its fishers to poach in our waters Your beating of war drums lead you think that you could rouse the people and win them back by beating war drums. If you are mistaken, the war was over many years ago," the Premier said.

Repeal of PTA, detrimental to interests of national security - MR
Attention should be drawn on the release of LTTE detainees on the request of certain entities and deproscription of the Tamil Diaspora groups in the name of reconciliation, said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in Parliament yesterday.
Reconciliation is not doing everything that the Tamil Diaspora wants, he said. We laid the foundation for reconciliation after end of war. We provided all facilities to the South and to the North, thereby achieving reconciliation, he said.
The former President said he warned the repealing of the Prevention of Terrorism Act would be detrimental to the interests of the national security and requested the government think twice before placing the countrys security at stake.
Participating at the committee stage debate on budget proposals, former President said: The government has also agreed to amend the Public Security Ordinance and to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act and replace it with legislation acceptable to foreign powers.
I see this as a reckless dismantling of the countrys core security legislation. In 2009, we militarily defeated the LTTE which had been officially named by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation as the deadliest terrorist organisation in the world. Though we have defeated the military machine of the LTTE, their political and financial structures based in Western countries remain intact. Therefore, my government maintained constant vigilance to ensure that there was no resurgence of terrorism in Sri Lanka. There were nearly four attempts of varying severity by separatist terrorists to regroup in the North, but due to our vigilance, my government was able to nip all those attempts in the bud.
At present, I see that vigilance no longer exists. My government rehabilitated and released over 11,000 LTTE cadres, while retaining in custody only those were considered to be dangerous to the community. The present government had hastily released hard core terrorists without disregarding the nations security, to political pressure from certain interested quarters. While the hardcore LTTE detainees are being released, the Prevention of Terrorism Act is being used to imprison members of the military, he said.
The PTA was enacted to deal with terrorism, not to detain members of the armed forces. If any investigation is to be carried out into the conduct of military personnel, the government has a duty to deal with the issue under the laws applicable to the military or under the ordinary laws of the country. That is a basic custom that we have to extend to members of the armed forces who sacrificed so much for the country. We have to be heedful of the self respect of our armed forces.
Officials of foreign organisations have been permitted unfettered access to Sri Lankas military installations, such as the Naval base in Trincomalee. This had resulted in an immediate danger posed to members of the intelligence wing of the Navy, reminiscent to the situation that arose after the Millennium City betrayal in 2002.
We have to be mindful of the events which occurred on the so called Mahavir Day marked recently. The black flags and the posters on the Jaffna campus openly defied Prabhakaran and called for the establishment of Eelam.
The Provincial Councils of the Northern Province ordered that schools be closed, while hartals and hunger strikes were organised in the North to pressurize the government to release the hardcore terrorists. We must be mindful of where these incidents are leading the country to
Despite danger signs that have been manifesting themselves, the government has taken the ill-advised move of removing the proscriptions on eight pro-LTTE organisations. A 17-year-old youth committed suicide by jumping in front of a moving train. It is said that a letter was found in his possession demanding that LTTE prisoners be released forthwith.
It is not possible to believe that a teenager would have resorted to this type of behaviour, without instigation and elaborate planning by others. I have seen on the internet photographs of the Tamil Youth Organisation and the Canadian Tamil Congress, both of whom were recently de-proscribed, hoisting the Eelam flag and paying public homage to Prabhakaran. These are organisations which my government banned to safeguard Sri Lankas security, but they have all been irresponsibly de-proscribed by the current administration.
Rajapaksa said officials of foreign governments have visited our country and made demands to Sri Lankas leadership about withdrawing the military from the Northern province. Decisions with regard to the deployment of troops are matters that should solely be within the sovereign jurisdiction of Sri Lanka. I cannot approve officials of foreign governments declaring that they will remain cautious and vigilant with regard to military matters in Sri Lanka.
He said the root cause of these problems is the ill-conceived foreign policy of the current administration which is based on bending backwards to please certain foreign governments which are in turn influenced in their policy towards Sri Lanka by various Tamil Diaspora organizations which could use their votes at elections in those countries, the former President said.
He said that in October this year, the present government ill-advisedly accepted and co-sponsored a resolution against Sri Lanka which is based on a report which states that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Sri Lankas armed forces committed grave crimes during the last phase of the war against the LTTE. In terms of this resolution, the government had agreed to establish a war crimes court to try Sri Lankas military personnel with the participation of foreign judges, prosecutors and investigators and to allow this mechanism to obtain funding from foreign countries.
They have also agreed to reform domestic laws to bring into line with the laws implemented by international war crimes tribunals.

Why dont the govt investigate secret cells at Trinco naval camp - Sumanthiran
Parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran told Parliament yesterday, that disappearances was a serious issue and around 20,000 complaints on disappearances have been received during the previous regime.
He questioned as to why the authorities have not investigated the underground secret cells at the Trincomalee Navy camp, while the then Navy Commander had also confirmed it. He said during an interview with a National newspaper, the then Navy Commander had strongly rebutted accusations that there had been a secret detention facility within the Trincomalee Naval base.
He also questioned whether the Boossa is a detainee camp or a remand prison, as there were persons who had been taken into custody were separately held in Boossa, while the others were held under judicial custody.
Though an assurance had been given by the government to commence a special process to release Tamil political prisoners on October 31 and complete the process by November 7. But they had bailed out only 39 suspects, while and one person was sent for rehabilitation.
"There were no suicides taking place during the previous regime with regard to the issue of Tamil political prisoners, as the people were aware that they could not expect a solution from them. But they have faith in this government," he said.
"The previous regime did not make any promises, but the present government continuously makes promises and breaches them. So there is no difference between the then government and the present government.
We are taking a political risk by supporting the Budget. Without fulfilling the needs and the expectations of Tamil community, the government is creating a fight between two groups. We have reached to the limits of our patience. said the MP.
He also questioned the government as to why it did not scheme to demobilize the Army.
He also expressed his displeasure over the establishment of a special court to carry out court proceedings relating to cases of Tamil prisoners, by the picking of a judge by the Minster of Justice, as it would affect the transparency of proceedings.
He also spoke about the minor staff appointments recently by the Justice Ministry and claimed that only one Tamil speaking person was among the 91 minor staffers who have been recruited. He also emphasised the necessity of filling of the vacancies of Tamil speaking judges.

War heroes to be offered Special Privilege Cards
The government is taking measures to offer a special privilege card to war heroes who rendered a great service to protect the nation, said Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardena yesterday.
He said the privilege card would be issued in coordination with fifty institutions in the country. He added that the government initiated these measures in recognition the war heroes.
He made these observations yesterday, joining the Committee Stage Debate on the Defence Ministry Financial Head.
Defence State Minister Wijewardena further stated that the government would not permit anybody to act in a way that would affect the national security, as the latter is considered to be of paramount importance.
He stated that the government is taking measures to procure all necessary items the security forces needed in order to strengthen them.
He also stated that discussions are under way to purchase the required flights for the Sri Lanka Air Force, adding that discussions are afoot to purchase two ships from India for the Navy.
He added that the international community admired Sri Lanka and President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who came forward to salvage the nation. He also said that due to the changes brought about by the duo, countries such as USA, China, Japan and the United Kingdom have come forward to strengthen Sri Lanka's security.

Police service will be brought to intl standards - Sagala
Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake told Parliament yesterday, that plans are afoot to bring our Police service to international standards.
He said as a first step towards this programme, the Special Task Force (STF) personnel will be deployed for UN Peace Keeping operations in several countries shortly, he said.
He said the government would enhance the quality of the Police Service. Salary anomalies would be rectified and salaries of Police personal would be increased by 20 percent this year and another 20 percent by next year. Right now, we have an obsolete Police Ordinance and we will take steps to pass the newly updated Police Ordinance, he added.
A Committee too has been appointed with experts in the field to address the shortcomings in the Police service, he said.
Minister Ratnayake said a new university would be established for only Police personnel to improve their skills and knowledge professionally and practically.
He said this is a radical budget which is being extensively debated in society now. This was not seen in previous budgets and this is healthy sign of good democracy, he said.

Law of country means people of the country - Ajith
Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera told Parliament yesterday that the law of this country is for the people of the country and it is necessary to ensure the legal rights of people.
Joining the Budget Committee Stage debate held for the 2nd allotted day, the Deputy Minister said that delays in trial procedures have undermined public confidence in the judicial system.
A large number of trials are still in progress.
The draft amendments to the Civil Procedure Code should be brought in to Parliament, which would enable to introduce the Pre Trial procedures to solve this issue. It would be done under the present government, he said.
He also added that the facilities concerning the main three institutions, Police, Courts and Prisons which ensure justice for the people, should be strengthened by providing educational facilities to police officers.

Police violated HNDA students' rights - SLHRC

The Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission yesterday determined that the Police violated the fundamental rights of Higher National Diploma in Accountancy (HNDA) students by dispersing a protest by them opposite the University Grants Commission.
The commission recommended that compensation be paid to the students who were subjected to assault and sustained injuries due to police assault.
The police was recommended to pay Rs. 25,000 as compensation to Shashini Sandipani Kumarasinghe who is receiving treatment after being assaulted by police during the HNDA protest.
The commission also recommended police to pay Rs. 15,000 as compensation to seven other students admitted to hospital following the attack.
Police was also informed to identify the police officials who assaulted the students and take disciplinary action against them.
The Department has also been ordered to inform the commission about the steps taken by the police in this regard before February 1 next year.
The commission made these decisions and recommendation after two complaints made by the Jathika Balaya Organisation and IUSF convenor Lahiru Weerasekera were taken into consideration.
Inspector General of Police N.K. Illangakoon, Western Province Senior DIG Pujith Jayasundera, DIG Gamini Maturata and SSP Champika Siriwardena were among the 11 respondents cited as respondents in the complaint.
The commission in a report consisting 31 pages said not a single woman police constable was among 200 police officials at the scene.
The commission has upheld that the students were subject to inhumane and disgraceful treatment and the action taken by the police to disperse the protest was not legal.
The commission has also drawn the attention as to why the IGP has not brought this matter into serious consideration at that moment.

'Radicalized' California shooter had terror ties

US: A US-born Muslim who along with his wife gunned down 14 people in California may have been radicalized and had been in contact with known terrorism suspects, reports said Thursday.
The FBI, which has cautioned it was too early to link the attack to terrorism, has taken charge of the investigation into Wednesday's mass shooting in San Bernardino.
Agents were combing through evidence to determine what prompted Syed Farook, 28, and his 27-year-old Pakistani wife Tashfeen Malik to carry out the rampage that also left 21 people wounded.
Law enforcement officials quoted by The New York Times said the FBI was treating the shooting as a potential terrorist act, but the agency was far from concluding it was and the motive remains unclear.
CNN, quoting officials, said Farook had been in contact with known terror suspects overseas and had become radicalized after marrying Malik in Saudi Arabia last year, although an imam at a local mosque he attended said Farook showed no signs of that.
The FBI -- who were scouring cell phones and a computer hard drive of the couple -- had evidence that Farook had communicated with extremists domestically and abroad a few years ago, the Times said, citing congressional officials briefed on the investigation.
President Barack Obama, who ordered flags to be flown at half-staff until Monday, said a terror attack could not be ruled out but also cautioned against jumping to conclusions.
"At this stage, we do not yet know why the terrible event occurred," said Obama, who has repeatedly called on the Republican-controlled Congress to pass tougher gun control measures, after a string of mass shootings across the United States in recent years.
"It is possible that this was terrorist related, but we don't know. It's also possible that this was workplace-related."
The attack was the deadliest mass shooting in the United States since the 2012 assault on an elementary school in Connecticut that left 26 people dead, including 20 children.
Some of the reasons pushing authorities to believe Wednesday's shooting may be terror-related included the astonishing arsenal the couple had amassed, their foreign travels, and the fact that they appeared to have meticulously planned the attack.
"There was obviously a mission here," David Bowdich, the assistant FBI director in charge of the Los Angeles office said, in the wake of the killings at a holiday party for county employees at a social services centre.
"We don't know if this was the intended target or if there was something that triggered him to do this immediately."
San Bernardino police chief Jarrod Burguan said Farook and his wife -- who dropped off their six-month-old daughter with Farook's mother shortly beforehand -- fired about 150 bullets inside the Inland Regional Center and during a subsequent shootout with police that left both dead, after a huge manhunt.
He said investigators had found an additional 5,000 rounds of ammunition at the couple's home along with 12 pipe bombs and bomb-making material. - AFP

Renault complete takeover of Lotus
Paris, Thursday: Renault completed their takeover of the Lotus team on Thursday ahead of the French manufacturer's return to Formula One in 2016, company boss Carlos Ghosn announced.
"Renault had two options: to come back at 100 percent or leave," said Renault chairman Ghosn .
"After a detailed study, I have decided that Renault will be in Formula 1, starting 2016," he added.
The French firm's return as a full team comes after the acrimonious split with Red Bull which garnered four driver's world titles in a row but ended after Renault had become angered by the Austrian team's criticism of their engines this year.
In taking over Lotus, Renault are essentially buying back the team they had sold to Genii Capital in 2009 and which was renamed Lotus F1 Team for the 2012 season.
Associated with the sport since 1977 Renault has two drivers and constructors titles to its name when Fernando Alonso won back to back championships in 2005-06.
Ghosn, elaborating on his firm's ambitions on their pitlane comeback, added: "Our ambition is to win--even if it will take some time."

The SLFP has proposed several amendments to Budget 2016 to make it more people friendly, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne said.
Addressing a press conference at the SLFP headquarters yesterday, the minister said these amendments were discussed during a meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake recently.
He noted the SLFP objected to the merger of the EPF and ETF funds as the trade union representatives they met were against this move. "They were of the view that the EPF and ETF funds must be managed under the Central Bank," he said.
"However, they also had favourable opinions to have a pension.We expressed these concerns, and the Prime Minister agreed to keep the fund under the Central Bank and not to merge the two funds. The money in these funds will be managed in a proper manner and a committee has been appointed look into the suitable steps," he explained.
He added the SLFP also proposed to either revoke or bring down the Emission Tax of Rs.5,000 to Rs 2,000. The minister said the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister also agreed to reconsider the revisions proposed to the fertilizer subsidy after the SLFP pointed out the need to extend it to other cultivations as well in addition to the paddy cultivation.
Another amendment proposed by the SLFP was to reduce the tax imposed on electric vehicles.

'Star Wars,' the space epic no one believed in

US: It may well be one of Hollywood's biggest success stories, but when the original "Star Wars" film was released in 1977 many people, including creator George Lucas, believed it would be a flop.
"I don't think anyone could have predicted what a smash hit and what a cultural phenomenon it was going to become," said Jonathan Kuntz, professor at UCLA's School of Theater, Film and Television.
"As soon as anybody saw 'Star Wars', they were converted and they fell in love with it."
But the early beginnings of the space epic didn't look that rosy.
Twentieth Century Fox, the film's distributor, hesitated over the film's $8 million budget and wasn't convinced a science fiction movie would fill theatres.
Such was the lack of enthusiasm that the studio planned a limited release and had to twist the arm of some theaters to agree to show the movie.
Given the budget constraints, Lucas agreed to a lower salary in exchange for full merchandising rights to the movie and any sequels -- a deal that would prove brilliant and make him very, very rich.
Prior to the film's release, Lucas organized a private showing to a group of film director friends and most, including Brian De Palma, gave it a thumbs down.
"It was a disaster," recalls Gary Kurtz, who produced the first two 'Star Wars' films.
"Everyone was like 'Oh, I don't know, it may not work'."
The only voice of dissent came from Steven Spielberg, who rightly predicted the movie would be a hit.
Still, Lucas was so convinced the movie would flop that on May 25, the day it was released, he went on holiday to Hawaii instead of attending the premiere.
And, as everyone knows, "Star Wars" immediately became a sensation and went on to become one of the highest grossing films of all time.
It played in theatres for one straight year, winning six Oscars and earning $775 million at the box office.
Overall, the space epic has generated $4.4 billion in box office revenue.
While that number is below earnings by the "James Bond" or "Harry Potter" movies, the upcoming release of the seventh instalment -- "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" -- as well as two planned sequels will likely make it "the undisputed champion of the box office as far as franchises go," said Jeff Bock, of the box office tracker Exhibitor Relations. - AFP

World's first washable smartphone to debut in Japan

JAPAN: Tired of those unsightly smudges and other dirt on your bacteria-laden smartphone
A Japanese firm says it has the solution with what it describes the world's first smartphone that can be washed with soap and water.
Waterproof smartphones have been on the market for a while. But telecom company KDDI says its new "Digno rafre" phone -- to be launched in Japan next week -- is the only one that can withstand a soapy bath.
"Our development team washed the smartphone more than 700 times to test its durability," a company spokesman told AFP.
An online commercial aimed at proving its credentials features a child dropping the phone onto a plate of food topped with ketchup.
His mother assures her shocked family that those red globs are nothing to worry about as she soaps up the phone under a running tap. The 21,600 yen ($175) gadget is mainly aimed at parents who want to keep their smartphones clean for their small children, a KDDI spokesman said.
But he also cautioned that only certain types of foamy soap could be used on the device, which will only be sold in Japan for now. - AFP
