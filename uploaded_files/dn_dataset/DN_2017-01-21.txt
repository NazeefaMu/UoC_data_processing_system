Journalism not recognised profession yet
Journalism has not received recognition as a profession, Sri Lanka Press Complaints Commission Officer Kamal Liyanarachchi said.
He was speaking at a seminar at Bindunuwewa, Bandarawela to raise awareness of provincial journalists in the Badulla district on the Right to Information Act.
He said criteria to elevate the practice of journalism to a professional level are yet to be achieved. He said the Press Complaints Commission acts as a self-regulating body in Sri Lanka.
Journalism is a profession that has not received legal recognition. The Working Journalists Association has not been included in the list of Professionals Associations. We need to have a Code of Ethics, special training, regulation mechanism, and a system of promotion, recruitment and salary scales for those engaged in journalism. These are challenging things. The Sri Lanka Press Institute works to overcome them, he said.

Asks FICA to assess security : Inzamam feels its safe to play cricket in Pakistan
Inzamam-ul-Haq, former Pakistan captain and current chief selector of the national team, said that security situation in Pakistan has improved a lot and it is once again safe to host international matches in the country.
Inzamam asked the Federation of International Cricketers Association (FICA) to send a delegation to Pakistan and take stock of current security situation in the country.
The former Pakistan batsman also called on other teams, foreign players and players associations to lend their support to the cause.
I think when they came here themselves and see that the security situation has improved a lot in Pakistan they will see it has become safe to play international cricket once again, he said in Islamabad.
Inzamam, who represented Pakistan in 120 Tests, said that Pakistan cricket had suffered a lot and gone backwards due to the absence of any international cricket matches in Pakistan since 2009.
FICA needs to understand that if the Pakistan cricket board is planning to hold the PSL final in Lahoreor invite the West Indies to play some matches it is only after getting clearance from the government,he noted.
It is only after consulting and coordinating with the government and other security agencies that thePCB has decided to now try to organise international matches once again in the country, Inzamam said.
No leading Test team has toured Pakistan since militants attacked the Sri Lankan team in Lahore inMarch, 2009.
Since then only Zimbabwe toured Lahore last May to play a short limited over series while Pakistan has managed to invite Afghanistan and Kenya to play in the country.
The former captain noted that in the recent past when the security situation was not safe the PCB itself avoided inviting teams to Pakistan on government advice.
Inzamam said if the FICA sent a delegation to Pakistan they would see for themselves the extreme passion and love that the people have for cricket. International cricket will only resume in Pakistan with support from other cricket playing nations, foreign players and players associations and that is why it is necessary for everyone to understand that the security situation has improved a lot in the country, he added. - NDTV

Celebrating Lanka, New Zealand national days together
A troupe of Sri Lankan dancers is ramping up rehearsals ahead of a Waitangi Weekend performance.
Students at the Sri Lankan Dance Academy will perform a piece celebrating New Zealand and Sri Lanka culture.
Celebrations is being held at the Little Theatre at the Dowse on February 4 which is also the Sri Lankan independence day.
"We can celebrate together," artistic director Mohan Sudusinghe said.
About 50 Sri Lankan dancers from around Wellington will perform traditional and contemporary cultural dances.
They have been practicing year round but getting back into it after the New Year break was always a challenge.
The dancers range in age from five to over 20 but dancing isn't the only entertainment in store.
"We have invited other groups - singing groups, New Zealand Friendship Society, like that  to give speeches and perform," Sudusinghe said. Maori artistes had also been invited to sing, in a concert that would blend the two cultures.
The performance was being put on with the help of Hutt City Council and volunteers from the community. Parents of the performers had really stepped up to help out.
"They give big support. Without them I couldn't do this," Sudusinghe said. Some parents were learning stage management tricks to help out with lighting and direction while others were lending a hand with costumes, finding and making accessories to go with the outfits.
Sudusinghe taught dance in Sri Lanka and ran his own dance school before moving to New Zealand in 2011. Teaching dance to children here helped keep them in touch with their cultural roots.
"I came here to give that flavour and culture to the kids." - Stuff

Chinas economy grows 6.7% in 2016
Chinas economy grew by 6.7% in 2016, compared with 6.9% a year earlier, according to official data, marking its slowest growth since 1990.
The figure is in line with Beijings growth target of between 6.5% and 7%.
But the news comes just a couple of days after the leader of one Chinese region admitted GDP data was faked.
China is a key driver of the global economy and a growth slowdown is a major concern for investors around the world.
Deception
Some analysts have taken heart from data showing growth in the last three months of 2016 was at an annual rate of 6.8% - a slightly faster pace than the rest of the year.
But many observers have been saying for a long time that the countrys growth was actually much weaker than the official data suggests.
And those beliefs gained more support this week, when the Governor of Liaoning, Chen Qiufa, said his province had been involved in a large-scale financial deception between 2011 and 2014, and that economic data had been doctored.
China is the worlds second-biggest importer of both goods and commercial services, meaning its economic performance has a big knock-on impact around the world.
It plays an important role as a buyer of oil and other commodities, and its slowdown has been a factor in the decline in the prices of such goods.
Beijings aim to rebalance the economy towards domestic consumption has led to major challenges for large manufacturing sectors, and there have been layoffs - especially in heavily staffed state-run sectors such as the steel industry.
Can we trust the numbers By Stephen McDonell, BBC Beijing Correspondent
Plenty of economists think that GDP is a massively flawed form of measuring the health of any economy but in this country it is even worse.
There is a significant proportion of China watchers who dont believe the GDP figures are real at all.
For example, in 2016, the countrys (year on year) GDP was exactly 6.7% for three quarters in a row.
While this seems numerically unlikely, I suppose it is possible that this could happen. BBC

Chinas rugby revolution: $100M mission to grow olive ball
China is making headlines with its stratospheric spending on global soccer stars but is it also undergoing a rugby revolution
The numbers in China are obviously mind-boggling, World Rugby CEO Brett Gosper tells CNN. As a nation, it's the No. 1 target not just for sport but all businesses.
A year ago, it had 76,000 rugby players. In 2016, another 60,000 Chinese were introduced to the oval-ball sport, and officials there hope for as many as a million players in five years. In addition, a $100 million deal to market rugby in China was signed in October. Just 0.01% of its populace are involved in the game barely a drop in the sporting ocean -- but China's politicians and sporting powers are keen on a quick step to rugby hegemony.
As its population approaches 1.5 billion roughly 20% of the world's total -- it is understandable that World Rugby is leaping at the chance for the game to conquer the territory.
But is it really possible to achieve such a gargantuan rise in playing numbers in such a short space of time
We have a fixed objective of one million players in 10 years, but that's being readjusted by the federation to five years I believe, Gosper says. That's a pretty meteoric rise.
The $100M, 10-year plan
While playing numbers alone are not enough to ensure China becomes a global force in the game, there are notably other initiatives primarily the $100 million agreed investment in the game over the next 10 years by Alisports, the sports arm of e-commerce giant Alibaba.
After the deal, Alisports chief executive Zhang Dazhong spoke of the undoubted potential for rugby to become a mass-participation sport in China, while national captain Ma Chong told the AFP news agency, as an athlete, I finally see hope for this sport.
The investment includes a Get Into Rugby initiative being set up at 10,000 universities and in schools across 20 of the country's 23 provinces.
There is also an ambitious plan to train up 30,000 coaches and 15,000 match officials in the next four years, and a push to structure a XVs competition plus a professional sevens league. Gene Tong, the regional training manager for Asia Rugby, has been in China since 2014.
He believes the sport is on the precipice of a big breakthrough in the next three years, with the 2019 Rugby World Cup and 2020 Olympics sevens tournaments to be hosted by neighbor Japan.
It could possibly be the golden era for rugby in China, as more schools and universities are taking up the game across the whole of China and World Rugby's programs are gaining popularity and being well accepted in China, Tong told CNN.
Rugby in China has great potential for growth and is set to see unprecedented growth over the new few years.
Tong acknowledges that basketball and football are much more popular in China, but points to sevens gaining new fans in particular.
Can China follow Japan's lead
Sevens rise has had a strong effect on rugby's global growth, but Gosper -- himself a former player in both formats of the sport is planning a dual attack in China.
The foundation of this great game is in XVs but sevens is obviously now an Olympic sport, which gives it huge credibility in China, he adds. - CNN

With China, The ASEAN, Japan, Bangladesh...: Sri Lanka will come into more agreements: Prime Minister
We will come into more agreements with Singapore, China, the ASEAN, Japan, and Bangladesh. Our intention is to create a platform for value addition and logistics in Sri Lanka. Prime Minster Ranil Wickremesinghe said. The ETCA agreement should be done by mid-year, he said.
The Prime Minster said so in an interview with the NDTV in Davos outlining Sri Lankas plans to develop its economy and become a regional economic hub.
We envisage closer cooperation among the five southern states of India, US, and Singapore, which will help us develop, he said. The Premier said he was in talks with Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu about working together to develop industrial infrastructure and with officials from Kerala about creating common tourism program.
Wickremesinghe also noted that plans are in place to develop the Trincomalee Port.
We are also in talks with India to develop Trincomalee as the main harbour for the Bay of Bengal. There are no sunken costs. We dont require breakwaters. But at the moment, the whole of Trincomalee is being planned out, he said.
"The Hambantota Port developments are going well and every country, not just China, is welcome to invest in the port," the Premier said.
Wickremesinghe mentioned that he would like to procure a $1 billion loan to jump start the Northern Provinces economy that would also help with rehabilitation.
Rehabilitation work is going on but there are problems. There are a large number of war combatants. There are women-headed households. A lot of people are psychologically affected by the last stages of the war. The fact is that villages have been uprooted not once, but twice and thrice, and putting the social fabric back is difficult. Theres a lot of work to be done, he said.

COPE report on 19 public enterprises: UNP backbenchers disappointed at pace of FCID, BC probes
The UNP backbenchers yesterday expressed their dissatisfaction at the pace with which investigations are carried on by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) and the Bribery Commission (BC) on the COPE report on 19 public enterprises tabled in Parliament last August 9, 2016.
They also demanded swift investigations into these public enterprises, while questioning the autonomy of the independent bodies responsible to conduct investigations in this regard.
The 19 public enterprises in the report include the Bank of Ceylon, Ceylon Electricity Board, LTL Holdings, Rakna Arakshaka Lanka, SriLankan Airlines, State Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Central Bank, Sri Lanka Cricket, Janata Estate Development Board, Agriculture and Agrarian Insurance Board, Lankaputra Development Bank and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation among others.
The COPE committee tabled this report in Parliament last August for a debate. The Speaker of Parliament then forwarded the report to the investigating bodies for which the investigation had not been expedited. They are still carrying out the investigations, UNP MP Harshana Rajakaruna complained.
Rajakaruna pointed out that the COPE report on 19 public enterprises should receive equal attention that the report on Central Bank Bond issue scam did.
None of these cases should be probed after they are debated in Parliament. Investigations on all these cases must be hastened, Rajakaruna said. The UNP backbenches are actively involved in discussing problems as these, Rajakaruna also said.
We are not like the former MPs who minded their own business. We positively communicate with the government and with our party, while steering hard to right the issues we have. We do not hold media displays. But, our struggle for the best might grow into a visible one,he said.As the government, we are unable to influence the investigating institutes to accelerate the inquiries because they are independent bodies, he also pointed out. .
We urge President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and these responsible institutes to quicken these investigations. Rajakaruna said.
MP Rajakaruna also said they are feeling skeptical whether the institutes responsible for investigations are genuinely impartial.
These institutions do not seem to give priority to large scale scams but keep focusing too much attention on less significant ones, he said.
Speaking on the Joint Oppositions claims on the national carriers aircraft order controversy, MP Rajakaruna said the allegations made by the JO are made of old cloth.
The JO is trying to make the present government look guilty over the wrongs they had committed, he said.
The contract to order these aircraft was singed even without Cabinet approval. The former SriLankan Airlines Chairman was a relative of ex-President Rajapaksa who allegedly reacted these like their own private property. It is their fault that a profitable company like the national carrier faced a disaster like this, Rajakaruna continued.
He pointed out the governments decision to cancel the contract after discussing with the Cabinet was the best option.
We were able to cancel this order by paying only 98 million dollars. If we did, we would have to pay 604 million dollars instead. he said.
Rajakaruna also said it was the Rajapaksa regime that challenged the Emirates Airlines owners visa and cancelled the contract with the Emirates which resulted in the national carrier which recorded a profit of Rs.4.4 billion in 2008, ended up incurring an alleged loss amounting to Rs. 107 billion.
UNP MP Harshana Rajakaruna was speaking at a media brief held at Department of Government Information. UNP MP Wijepala Hettiarachchi also spoke.

DECISION ON SRILANKAN BIDDERS SOON
Report submitted to PM:
Three shortlisted buyers out of nine:
The report on the three bidders for SriLankan Airlines has been submitted to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and he is to make a decision on it in the next two to three weeks, Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim said yesterday.
At present, we are looking into whether the companies have adequate and reliable funding for the proposals, he added.
The minister addressing a media briefing at the ministry said it was imperative that the debt ridden airline finds a bidder soon.
The Treasury has said they would soon stop supporting our recurrent expenditure though they will cover the debt,he said.
The three shortlisted buyers out of the initial nine are Texas Pacific Group (TPG), PeaceAir Pvt Ltd and the Maldivian company Super Group Partners.
None of the shortlisted bidders have experience in running an international airline, though TPG is famous for its business restructuring,Hashim said and noted that none of the major airlines had made a bid for SriLankan.
We are looking for an equity partner and are prepared to hand over managerial powers to them. The national carriers status however will be maintained and thus the government will have the majority stake in the airline and that will not be compromised,Hashim said. The Prime Minister had also informed the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) that if currently shortlisted companies were not satisfactory, another committee comprising of the three ministers; Sarath Amunugama, Malika Samarawickrema and Kabir Hashim would be appointed and fresh bids for the Airline called for.
PeaceAir in the meantime held a media briefing on Thursday to state that the bid evaluation process was not transparent. The company owned by businessman Gamini Wethasinghe said the government was supposed to open up SriLankan Airlines for due diligence from Peace Air and its consulting partners Lufthansa Consulting and Privatair, but that was yet to happen.

Dialog A division rugby : Havies have the edge over Airmen
The high-riding Havelock Sports Club will go out favourites against Air Force Sports Club in their Dialog A Division League return game at Havelock Park under lights today commencing 6.30 p.m.
The Airmen played a superb game against Police SC in their last game at Ratmalana winning after a close fight by 15 points to 13, hence they will have to carry out a similar kind of performance if they hope to beat the Havelock's outfit.
The forte of the Air Force side has been their power-packed forwards and along with their speedy three quarter line they should come up with another blockbuster display with skipper Gayantha Iddamalgoda, Ashok Wijeyjumar, Saraka Weralla, lanky Thilina Bandara, the Medagedara brothers, Dimithri Patabandi, Ranindu Padmasanka, Nuwan Perera, Sooriya Krishan along with their ever green national centre Charith Seneviratne likely to give off their very best.
Meanwhile the high riding Havelock's side who turned tables on Army SC in their last outing at Ratmalana last week will go all out to get a bonus point victory against the formidable Airmen in their own den at Havelock Park.
Teams:
Air Force SC (Probable XV): Pushpakumara Samarahewa, Lahiru Udayanga, Prasad Medagedara, Thilina Bandara, Ranil Medagedara, Dimithri Patabandi, Dinesh Weeraratne, Saraka Waralla, Ashok Wijekumar and Gayantha Iddamalgoda (Captain), Ranindu Padmasanka, Sooriya Crishan, Charith Seneviratne, Ishara Madushan, Nuwan Perera, Head Coach: Leonard de Zilwa.
Havelocks SC (Probable XV): Dushmantha Priyadarshana Bodhi (Captain), Prasath Madushanka, Ashan Darling, Ganindu Lakshan, Sharo Fernando, Shenal Deelaka, Sudarshana Muthuthanthri, Lasindu Ishan, Sudam Sooriarachchi and Niroshan Fernando, Chamara Dabare, Nishon Perera, Hirantha Perera, Kevin Kutty Dixon, Dulaj Perera, Coach: Ronnie Ibrahim.
Kandy wont have it easy against Police
Kandy SC who scored a thumping 50-22 win over Navy SC at Nittawela last week will go all out to give a repeat performance when they take on a gallant Police SC outfit in their Dialog A Division League rugby second round match at Police Park today. Kickoff is at 4.00pm.
Police who went down fighting to Air Force SC (13-15) at Ratmalana last week will have to come up with a much better performance if they hope to overcome the lads from Kandy lads who have notched up heavy scoring victories over top sides like CR & FC, Havelocks and Navy; hence the cops should rally around and strive hard to pull off this game in their favour.
Teams:
Police SC (Probable XV): Udara Gayan, Achala Perera, Randeera de Silva, Romesh Archirige, Udara Sooriyapperuma (Captain), Radeesha Seneviratne, Ranjan Harischandra, Diren Warnakulasuriya, Mohamad Abzal and Sandesh Jayawickrama, Hashan Gmes, Musheen Falleel, Chula Susantha, Reeza Rafaideen, Rajitha Sanzoni, Head Coach: Sudath Sampath
Kandy SC (Probable XV): Piyumal Manchanayaka, Damith Dissanayake, Kishore Jehan or Ganuka Dissanayaka, Shehan Dimitri, Gayan Ratnayake, Heshan Kalhara, Soyuru Anthony, Buwaneka Udangamuwa, Roshan Weeraratna (Captain) or Srinath Sooriyabandara and Fazil Marija or Arshad Jamaldeen, Richard Dharmapala, Kanchana Ramanayaka, Lavanga Perera or Danushka Ranjan, Vishvamithra Jayasinghe, Danusha Dayan. Head Coach: Shawn Wijesinghe
Navy favourites against CH
Navy SC will go out as favourites to overcome the hapless CH and FC in their second round Dialog A Division League rugby match at Navy grounds, Welisara today. Kick-off is at 4.00pm.
Navy thus far is the superior team and have lost only two matches in the ongoing league tournament to Havelock's SC in the first round and Kandy SC in the return leg last week at Nittawela.
CH and FC have lost all their ten matches played to-date and look a sorry outfit. Hence they might look to give an improved performance through their third row forward and former national captain cum flanker Yoshitha Rajapaksa who is leading them from the front against his former club. The sailors will field the same team which did duty for them last week against Kandy SC.
Teams
Navy SC (Probable XV): Roshan Ranasinghe (Captain) or Stefan Greogary, Dulanjana Wijesinghe, Kasun De Silva, Supun Peiris, Sathya Ranathunga, Sajith Saranga ,Danushka Gertha  Perera, Nivanka Prasad, Richie Dharmapala and Chanaka Chandimal, Buddhima Piyaratne, Lee Keegal, Lahiru Herath, Saliya Handapangoda, Thilina Weerasinghe, Head Coach : Mothilal Jayathilake, Asst.Coach: Dev Anandh

Differences of opinion, a hall mark of vibrant democracy: Navin
The main parties of the National Unity Government had no issue that could not be solved by way of discussion, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said yesterday.
He said the understanding between the UNP and the SLFP in the government is vibrant and remains strong although there are differences in ideas.
He added President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are confident over their unity to run the National Unity government, although those of the opposition speculate of a split not knowing the fact in a democracy, people are entitled to hold different views within the government. Minister Dissanayake was speaking at a press conference at the Plantation Industries Ministry Auditorium. The opposition might have misunderstood Minister Sajith Premadasas emotional statements made at the Cabinet against the curtailment of his funds by the Finance Ministry, Minister Dissanayake.
Even I did the same when the Finance Minister attempted to curtail funds from my ministry. The Finance Minister might have reasons to do so and so have I reasons to object, Minister Dissanayake said.
He also said that that is the democracy within the government. Our right to speak and object at the cabinet in the government is guaranteed, Minister Dissanayke said. When a media personnel questioned about the Presidents decision to fix the price of a lottery ticket at Rs.20 when an attempt was made to increase it to Rs.30, the minister said that it was a good trend that would benefit the people. He added that many of members were of the view that the price of the lottery ticket should not be increased. No body needs a rubber stamp President of a rubber stamp Prime Minister, Minister Dissanayake said.
When there is Check and Balance it is good for democracy.

Donald Trump Inauguration Speech: [Video/Full Text]

President Trump delivered his inaugural speech outside the Capitol Building, Washington.
Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: thank you.
We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.
Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come.
We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.
Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent. Thank you.
Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another - but we are transferring power from Washington, DC and giving it back to you, the American people.
For too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.
Washington flourished - but the people did not share in its wealth.
Politicians prospered - but the jobs left, and the factories closed.
The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.
Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.
That all changes - starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.
It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.
This is your day. This is your celebration.
And this, the United States of America, is your country.
What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.
January 20th, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.
The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.
Everyone is listening to you now.
You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.
At the centre of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.
Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.
These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public.
But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealised potential.
This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.
We are one nation - and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.
The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.
For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry;
Subsidised the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military;
We've defended other nation's borders while refusing to defend our own;
And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.
We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.
One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind.
The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.
But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.
We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.
From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.
From this moment on, it's going to be only America First. America First.
Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.
We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.
I will fight for you with every breath in my body - and I will never, ever let you down.
America will start winning again, winning like never before.
We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.
We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.
We will get our people off of welfare and back to work - rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.
We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American.
We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world - but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.
We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.
We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones - and unite the civilised world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.
At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.
When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
The Bible tells us, how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.
We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.
When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
There should be no fear - we are protected, and we will always be protected.
We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we will be protected by God.
Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.
In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.
We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action - constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.
The time for empty talk is over.
Now arrives the hour of action.
Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.
We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.
We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.
A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.
It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American flag.
And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.
So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words:
You will never be ignored again.
Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.
Together, We will make America strong again.
We will make America wealthy again.
We will make America proud again.
We will make America safe again.
And, yes, together, we will make America great again. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.

Donald Trump sworn in as 45th US President
Donald Trump has pledged a great national effort to be rebuild America after being sworn in as the 45th President of the United States.
The 70-year-old billionaire took the oath of office on the west steps of the US Capitol in Washington and brought the curtain down on the presidency of Barack Obama.
In his inaugural address, Mr Trump promised to transfer power from Washington to the people, and pledged a great national effort to rebuild the country.
Mr Trump said January 20 would be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.
The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer, the new President said.
Mr Trump added: From this day forward its going to be only America first.
We must protect our border from the ravages of other countries. I will fight for you with every breath of my body and I will never let you down.
Continuing the populist tone of his victorious campaign,
Mr Trump said that a small group in Washington had reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed. SKY News

MELBOURNE: Svetlana Kuznetsova came through a punishing battle of the ages against fellow veteran Jelena Jankovic on Friday, with the Russian amazed she was able to hang on and turn the match around.

Former England womens cricket captain and icon of sport Rachael Heyhoe-Flint dies at the age of 77
Tributes have poured in for former England womens cricket captain Rachael Heyhoe-Flint, who has died at the age of 77.
Heyhoe-Flint became one of the MCCs first women members and in 2004 was the first woman ever elected on to the clubs full committee.
On the pitch, in a near 20-year international career, she represented her country 45 times in Tests and one-day internationals and won the 1973 World Cup as captain - having played a central role in establishing the tournament, two years before the mens equivalent.
The MCC announced her death on Wednesday evening, writing on Twitter: MCC is deeply saddened to hear that Honorary Life Member, Rachael Heyhoe Flint has died aged 77.
...in a 20-year-career (she was) considered one of the finest womens players ever.
The MCC flag on the Lords clock tower has been lowered to half-mast as a mark of respect for a
cricketer who played in the first womens match to take place at the ground - against Australia in 1976 - and MCC president Matthew Fleming paid a personal, heartfelt tribute.
He said: This is a terribly sad day for everyone involved in cricket and all of us at MCC.
Rachael Heyhoe-Flint was a pioneer of womens cricket - she was the first global superstar in the womens game - and her overall contribution to MCC, cricket and sport in general was immense.
Her impact on MCC, be it through events on the field or in the committee room, was immeasurable - and her enthusiasm, wisdom and gentleness of character will be missed by everyone with whom she came into contact. We all loved her.
Heyhoe-Flint hit almost 1,600 runs at 45.54 in her 22 Tests, and averaged more than 58 in her 23 one- day internationals.
She was inducted into the International Cricket Councils Hall of Fame in 2010, having become an honorary life member at the MCC in 1999 and gone on to serve two terms on the club committee. Clare Connor, the England and Wales Cricket Boards director of womens cricket and also a former national captain, told Sky Sports News: We talk of trailblazers, women in sport who have really broken boundaries - Rachael is up there with the very, very best of them. She was my friend and mentor and inspiration - and I am not alone. Rachael was one of our sports true pioneers, and it is no exaggeration to say that she paved the way for the progress enjoyed by recent generations of female cricketers. We are all in her debt on this very sad day.
Heyhoe-Flint was inducted into the International Cricket Councils Hall of Fame in 2010 

Sarah Taylor, the England wicketkeeper currently taking a break from cricket, wrote on Twitter: Such sad news to hear the passing of Rachael Heyhoe-Flint. A complete legend of the womens game. We owe her so much RIP Taylors former England team-mate Ebony-Jewel Rainford-Brent added on Sky Sports News: She truly has changed womens cricket and womens sport.
Many people dont know that the first World Cup was a Womens World Cup, she was instrumental in getting sponsorship to make that happen - and then went on to lead England and was the winning captain. Shes a complete game-changer. She was successful on the pitch but off it, shes made so many
changes for the sport its unbelievable.
ECB chairman Colin Graves said in a statement: I sat with Rachael on the ECB board for five years and considered it a privilege.
The development of womens cricket to its current position, which really is unrecognisable from when Rachael was playing, is a lasting tribute to her.
Chief executive Tom Harrison added: She was simply extraordinary... a lifelong ambassador for cricket in its widest context.
Cricket was hugely enhanced by her fearless approach and pioneering spirit, not to mention her
wicked sense of humour which made her such wonderful company.
Heyhoe-Flint, who died after a short illness, was also closely associated with her hometown football club Wolves as a vice-president. A club statement spoke of her huge contribution to Wolves and Wolverhampton, while flags at
Molineux and at the City of Wolverhampton Council offices were flying at half-mast. Broadcaster Jacqui Oatley referenced the Wolves connection as she paid tribute to a close friend.
Oatley tweeted: Heart-broken to hear that Rachael Heyhoe-Flint has passed away. Our lifelong family friend, an inspiration to so many, a truly special lady.
RHF was instrumental in bringing (former club president and benefactor) Sir Jack Hayward to Wolves.
Shed previously written to him as England cricket captain to ask for funding.
She was certainly a pioneer. Dont sit around and moan about something, change it for the better.
She always did so with a smile on her face Fellow broadcaster Piers Morgan added: RIP Rachael Heyhoe Flint, 77. Pioneer of womens cricket, great player & delightful lady.

Kabir tells JO: Use of A350 aircraft would cost airline US$ 1 m loss per month
Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim replying to allegations the Joint Opposition (JO) said yesterday the continued use of the A350 aircraft would have cost SriLankan Airlines a loss of US$ 1 million per month, compared to the total loss of US$ 98 million for its cancellation.
The Joint Opposition on Wednesday lodged a complaint against Hashim with the Bribery Commission and the CID accusing the government of accruing a loss of US$ 98 million due to the cancellation of three A350 aircraft.
In 2008, when Emirates had a 40 percent stake in SriLankan, the net profit for the year stood at US$ 4.4. million. After they were kicked out, between 2008-2014, they had accrued a loss of Rs 32 billion, the minister said
Minister Hashim was addressing a media briefing at the Ministry yesterday. In 2015, the new administration had also inherited a debt of Rs 150 billion, the minister said.
We could have built another one and a half Southern Expressways with that debt, he said.
In 2016, the losses suffered by the airline had been brought down to Rs 1,600 million.
Hashim also explained that due to increasing loses, they had to also make the decision to scrap four A350 aircraft that had been ordered by the previous regime.
The agreements signed, according to the minister had no exit clauses and thus they had to re-negotiate terms of exit, After discussions, we paid US$ 17 million for one, and US$ 98 million for the other three, said Hashim.
The four A350 planes were taken under long term leases for a period of 12 years. We estimated that by the end of it, we would have paid over US$ 600 million for them,Hashim said. Contrary to what the Joint Opposition says, there was no business plan for them. They just a report from a firm called Seaburry asking whether the A350 planes were better than Boeing 747, he added.
The A350s were purchased through the leasing company Aircap for a lease rate of US$ 1.4 million per month per aircraft when the market lease rate at the time stood at US$ 950,000, revealed the minister. The previous regime had also taken a lease on an A330 at a lease rate of US$ 450,000 per month when the lease rate in the market was US$ 350,000.
The ministry however has chosen to extend the A330 lease with a new rate and has also taken out a new lease for another A330.
In June last year, SriLankan Airlines also cancelled its routes to Frankfurt, Paris and Rome and the Minister explained that these routes were accruing a loss of US$ 2.4 million loss per month and only ran at a load factor of 82 at most. The Airline is to concentrate on more regional flights, he said.
We cant even make it with a lease of US$ 450,000 (A330), we would not be able to survive if we used the A350 with a lease of US$ 1.4 million. The A350s also can fly non-stop for 17 hours but our longest flight to London is just 11 hours. So it just didnt make sense to keep these A350 planes,reiterated the minister.
Another four A350s which were ordered directly via Airbus and scheduled to arrive in 2020 will also be cancelled, the minister said, and insisted that all decisions were made according to proper procedures.
I believe we have taken the right decision to save the company,he said.

KANDY SPORTS ROUND-UP: Kandy to tackle Police this weekend
Following Kandy's big win against the sailors last week this weekend's second leg Dialog league match doesn't have the same sense of anticipation as last week. Kandy is clearly an organized side that is only improving while the Cops will be struggling to break the shackles in today's game. It will take something really special from the Policemen, or some sudden reversal of poor play from Kandy to overturn the result. Several of the Police players are fighting for their future while the Kandy side wants to maintain their dominance. Hopefully no matter what the outcome but a good game of rugby should be showcased, not ending one sided. So, the stronger, smarter, and fitter Kandy rugby team who are gearing up having won all three second round games will be at Police Park to scrum down with the Policemen who went down to Airmen. Irshad Cader in charge of the whistle. In this game Kandy will try some new ploys to manacle the policemen in their own den.

Legal barriers for Hambantota roads rehabilitation
Rehabilitating rural roads under several local government institutes in the Hambantota district posses a serious problem since excavating gravels for them raises legal issues, Housing and Constructions Minister Sajith Premadasa said at a Hambantota District Coordinating Committee meeting recently.
Rehabilitation work of roads in the Tissamaharama D.S. Divisions, Lunugamvehera, and Suriyawewa areas had come to a standstill even though the funds for them had been allocated, since locations to excavate gravel could not be found due to legal issues. Local Government institution secretaries said suitable places to excavate gravel are in wildlife conservation zones and forest reserves, but those authorities would not permit to excavate gravels.
Minister Premadasa requested these institutions to issue permissions to excavate gravel for road rehabilitation work.

Mafia at SriLankan still exists: Kabir
Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim yesterday expressed disappointment over not being able to clean up SriLankan Airlines and bring the offenders to book.
There is a mafia within SriLankan Airlines and they still exist. It is not only SriLankan but even other government institutions have this. The Weliamuna report was released during the first 100 days but no action has been taken, the minister told a media briefing at the ministry.
The Weliamuna report accused several top officials including its former Chairman Nishantha Wickremesinghe of financial misappropriation.
Certain people have to go to clean up SriLankan and I am determined to clean it up. We are going ahead with the systematic changes that need to be made. I dont want it to be seen as political revenge, he said.
Meanwhile, SriLankan Airlines Chairman Ajith Dias dismissed the Weliamuna report and said there was no problem with the airline.
The Minister responding to it said: Everybody has a right to an opinion but I believe that the Weliamuna report is valid and that it has to be implemented. In response to why he did not take appropriate action, Hashim said he was restricted when it came to implementing certain things.
The Finance Ministry has a golden share of these institutions and thus they too have the authority to appoint people. My powers are limited but I am trying to work around that, he said.

Making America Great Again
A new era dawned for the United States and the world yesterday when Donald Trump took oaths as the 45th President of the United States. This is the first time in contemporary history that the US has elected a President who has had no prior political or military experience. His victory at the election came as a surprise to the entire world. The billionaire real estate mogul and reality TV star came as a complete outsider to the Republican Party nominations fray and ultimately walked away with the coveted prize of the Presidency of the United States. This is a singular achievement by any yardstick, but most analysts believe that simmering voter disenchantment with the Washington status quo was one of the reasons that led to his victory. In other words, voters believed that a complete outsider with no Washington links could do a better job.
And being the President of the United States is no easy job. We have often heard the phrase with great power comes great responsibility and nowhere is it more applicable than to the US Presidency. Precisely because he is not a politician, Trump has spoken his mind on many issues, setting the Twitter sphere alight with statements on everything from foreign policy to US exports. However, he may find that actual governance in a different matter altogether because the US has to work in a global framework, especially when it comes to dealing with multilateral issues such as the Iran nuclear deal. The deal is holding and any unilateral action by Trump may affect the delicate nature of the agreement.
Another reason for Trump's victory was his populist and nationalist agenda which advocated tough controls on immigration and trade. He has vowed to build a wall along the border with Mexico, though the latter has outright refused to pay for it in whatever manner. Nevertheless President Trump has outlined plans to initially build it with US taxpayers money, which might not go down well with the populace. A wall with Mexico will fundamentally alter the American landscape literally and metaphorically.
As for trade, President Trump has threatened to pull the US out of the Trans Pacific Partnership, impose higher tariffs on goods from China and even Germany (a 35 percent import duty on German cars) and re-evaluate any other trade agreements not favourable to the US. He has urged companies such as Apple to make their products in the United States. His Twitter tirades on this issue has already resulted in Fird cancelling a plan to build a car plant in Mexico. But due to the complex nature of global manufacturing and trade, it might always not be possible to manufacture everything in the US itself. Higher prices precipitated by higher labour costs in the US may also drive up prices of US made goods in the world market, which will not augur well for the US in the long run.
Judging by his controversial Twitter pronouncements, the world will eagerly watch the new President's foreign policy moves. He has repeatedly pledged to mend fences with Russia, which many within his own party have viewed with disdain. However, a thaw in relations between the two giants could be a good development in terms of global stability. It is no secret that Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin admire each other and a personal rapport between the two men may turn out to just what the doctor ordered for maintaining world peace and combating terrorism.
Trump was the first incoming or sitting President in more than 40 years to directly speak to the leader of Taiwan, which has not been well received in China. Any break from the One China policy will have far reaching ramifications for the two countries and we hope that saner counsel will prevail on this issue. Trump's staunchly pro Israel policy has been equally controversial along with a plan to move the US embassy to Jerusalem. Many in Israel itself are wary of the move. The previous Barack Obama administration was a passionate advocate of the two state solution and again, President Trump will have to negotiate these waters carefully.
It is well known that Trump did not have a good rapport with the media before and after the election. He has accused them of siding with his opponent Hillary Clinton, calling the likes of CNN fake news outlets. Plans to send the White House press corps packing to another building has already stirred a hornet's nest. Trump apparently believes that he can get his message through to the public in a more effective manner through the social media.
Trump's Cabinet picks mostly follow his line, but some have expressed reservations about certain issues such as warming up to Russia. The actions of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defence General James Mad Dog Mattis will be closely watched by the world, but it is Trump's other two picks that have created a bigger controversy. Both his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner will be intimately involved in the administration which may pose an ethical dilemma. The same applies to Trump's vast business empire and critics are already pointing out conflict of interest issues.
But President Trump seems to be unfazed by his detractors. His will certainly be a different style of Governance and upholding some of his pledges will not be easy. But there is every chance that he will get over the rhetoric and turn out to be a very practical and pragmatic leader. However, only time will tell whether he could Make America Great Again.

Manchester United named worlds leading revenue-generating club
Manchester United generated the most revenue of any football club in the world last season, according to a report published by Deloitte.
United dethrone Real Madrid - who held top spot for 11 years - after accumulating a record revenue of 689m euros (515m) during the 2015-16 term.
The Premier League club saw commercial revenue grow by 100m euros (71m).
Combined revenue for the top 20 clubs during the 2015-16 season grew 12% to 7.4bn euros (6.41bn) - a new record. It is the first time Manchester United have topped the annual Deloitte Football Money League since the 2003-04 season.
Real drop down to third, behind Spanish rivals Barcelona, who remain in second spot.
German giants Bayern Munich move up a position to fourth and Manchester City also climb a spot to fifth - having generated 524.9 euros (392.6m) - up from 463.5 euros (352.6m) during the previous season. It is the first time they have reached the top five of the annual list.
Eight Premier League clubs make the top 20, with revenues totalling nearly 3.2bn euros (2.4bn).
Champions Leicester City (20th) enter the top 20 for the first time. They produced a revenue of 172m euros (128m) - which is almost five times the revenue generated two seasons before in 2013-14.
Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham remain in seventh, eighth, ninth and 12th place, with West Ham in 18th position.
Dan Jones, partner in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said Manchester United's record revenues were achieved by phenomenal commercial revenue growth.
He added: In recent years, their ability to secure commercial partnerships with value in excess of that achievable by their peers has been the crucial factor in enabling the club to regain their place at the top of the money league. That said, they'll face strong competition from Barcelona and Real Madrid to retain the top spot in next year's edition, due to the lack of Champions League football, the weakening of the pound against the euro and, over the longer term, as other clubs enter the commercial market demanding similar deals, using United as the precedent.

Mangala outlines course correction in Sweden
Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera outlined the progress of the National Unity Government towards promoting reconciliation and building peace in Sri Lanka, at Stockholms Museum of Mediterranean and Near Eastern Antiquities on Wednesday.
The Swedens Institute for Security and Development Policy, along with the Sri Lankan Embassy, organised the talk.
The set of actions that the government has identified to deal with the past in a comprehensive manner, addressing the grievances of all victims, include truth seeking, justice, reparation and measures for guaranteeing non-recurrence, he said. As a first step, we have enacted legislation to set up an Office on Missing Persons, he said adding that plans for a Truth-Seeking Commission and a Reparations Office will soon be finalised.
He said civilian administration in the Northern and Eastern reaches of Sri Lanka has been restored, and that the government is taking steps to establish the equality of all citizens. After noting that the island had squandered its chance to develop due to the civil conflict, the Minister said the government was working hard to make up for lost time.
We repealed the 18th Amendment to the Constitution and adopted the 19th Amendment, which reintroduced the two-term limit of the Presidency, reduced the term of the Presidency from six to five years, established a constitutional council, and recognised the right to information as a fundamental right, he said.
He highlighted the importance of drafting a new Constitution.
As an important measure to prevent recurrence of conflict, Parliament, last year, unanimously adopted a Resolution for Parliament to sit as a Constitutional Assembly to draft a new Constitution, he said.
Samaraweera focused on economic matters as well, telling the audience that Sri Lanka has a good chance of gaining GSP+ status while also highlighting its infrastructural developments.
The governments plan of making Sri Lanka an Indian Ocean hub are beginning to bear fruit; the Colombo international financial city; the Hambantota, Colombo East and Trincomalee ports; and the Katunayake and Palali airports are all hives of activity, he said.
Samaraweera said the country is working to reestablish diplomatic relations with the outside world. He mentioned the strong ties between Sweden and Sri Lanka as evidenced by Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstms 2016 visit.

Murray, Federer masterclass wows Aussie Open
MELBOURNE, Friday - Andy Murray and Roger Federer put on a masterclass on Friday as they swept into the last 16 of the Australian Open, hoping to take advantage of Novak Djokovic's shock exit.
Murray swamped Sam Querrey 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 and Federer humbled Tomas Berdych 6-2, 6-4, 6-4 in just 90 minutes, maintaining his 100 percent record over his old rival at Melbourne Park.
Women's world number one Angelique Kerber also hit form as she dropped only four games against Kristyna Pliskova to race into a fourth-round meeting with America's Coco Vandeweghe.
Murray and Federer had both watched from afar on Thursday as Djokovic, the defending champion and six-time winner, suffered a stunning defeat to 117th-ranked Denis Istomin.
Querrey also upset Djokovic at Wimbledon last year but Murray, made a knight in Britain's New Year honours, never looked like slipping on any banana skins in round three.
He put Querrey away 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 in just under two hours, winning 77 percent of points on his first serve and facing only three break points in a clinical display.
The Scottish world number one also showed no signs of discomfort in his right ankle, after he rolled it painfully during his second-round win over Andrey Rublev.
I felt better and better as the match went on in terms of my movement, he said. The ankle was a little sore and I was a little tentative at the start but it got better and better through the match.
Federer, 35 and returning from an injury lay-off, said he even surprised himself with an imperious win over Berdych that left the Czech shaking his head as he departed.
In practice things were going well, but I've never been the practice king. I was winning tons of sets, Federer said, adding: It's been unbelievable. I did surprise myself. Murray and 17th-seeded Federer are on course to meet in the quarter-finals, with the Scot next facing Mischa Zverev and the Swiss veteran up against Kei Nishikori.
Japan's Nishikori should provide a stern test for Federer and the fifth seed underlined his confident form by seeing off Slovakian qualifier Lukas Lacko 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.
Stan Wawrinka, the 2014 champion, survived a four-set tussle with Viktor Troicki 3-6, 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (9/7) and now faces Italy's Andreas Seppi, who ousted Steve Darcis of Belgium.
Jo-Wilfried Tsonga also came through in four sets against American Jack Sock and will play Briton Dan Evans, who beat Australia's Bernard Tomic 7-5, 7-6 (7/2), 7-6 (7/3).
In the women's draw, Kerber finally got into her stride with a 6-0, 6-4 destruction of Kristyna Pliskova, the 58th-ranked twin sister of Czech fifth seed Karolina.
The German defending champion was an early loser at both of her warm-up tournaments and was taken to three sets in unconvincing wins in round one and two.
But Kerber clicked into gear against Pliskova, winning in just 55 minutes to set up a last-16 clash with America's Coco Vandeweghe, who ousted Canadian starlet Eugenie Bouchard.
I'm looking forward to the next one. Yeah, I think that I find my rhythm to the tournament now, Kerber said.
Svetlana Kuznetsova outlasted fellow thirty-something Jelena Jankovic 6-4, 5-7, 9-7 and will next play fellow Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.
Venus Williams beat Duan Yingying 6-1, 6-0 to end Chinese interest, earning a match with German qualifier Mona Barthel who overcame Australia's Ashleigh Barty in three sets.

NASA to send spacecraft to metal asteroid
US: NASA is preparing to send a spacecraft to a giant "metal" asteroid that may tell scientists the secret of how our solar system was formed. Led by Arizona State University researchers, the mission called "Psyche" is focused to know whether the asteroid, called "16 Psyche" and thought to be made of iron and nickel, could be part of what was an earlier planet perhaps as large as Mars.
"This is an opportunity to explore a new type of world -- not one of rock or ice but of metal," Lindy Elkins-Tanton, Psyche's principal investigator, said in a statement.
Psyche robotic mission will launch in October 2023 and will arrive at the asteroid in 2030, following an Earth gravity assist spacecraft maneuver in 2024 and a Mars flyby in 2025, NASA said in a post.
"'16 Psyche' is the only known object of its kind in the solar system and this is the only way humans will ever visit a core. We learn about inner space by visiting outer space," added Elkins-Tanton. "16 Psyche" is nearly three times farther away from the sun than is the Earth. The asteroid measures about 210 kilometres in diameter.
Scientists believe that the asteroid might have lost its outer core through a series of collisions and the mission could shed light on how planets and other masses broke up into cores, mantles and crusts years ago.
According to a report in Global News, the iron in "16 Psyche" would be worth $10,000 quadrillion (That's right, $10,000 quadrillion, as in 15 more zeros). NASA has also selected another mission known as Lucy that will visit Jupiter's mysterious Trojan asteroids.
Lucy, a robotic spacecraft, is scheduled to launch in October 2021. It's slated to arrive at its first destination, a main belt asteroid, in 2025.
From 2027 to 2033, Lucy will explore six Jupiter Trojan asteroids.
These asteroids are trapped by Jupiter's gravity in two swarms that share the planet's orbit, one leading and one trailing Jupiter in its 12-year circuit around the sun.
The Trojans are thought to be relics of a much earlier era in the history of the solar system, and may have formed far beyond Jupiter's current orbit. "This is a unique opportunity," said Harold F. Levison, principal investigator of the Lucy mission.
"Because the Trojans are remnants of the primordial material that formed the outer planets, they hold vital clues to deciphering the history of the solar system. Lucy, like the human fossil for which it is named, will revolutionise the understanding of our origins," Levison added. - PTI

Navin justifies Wimal's arrest
Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said the charges against Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa had been investigated for almost two years before he was arrested while the charges against Namal Rajapaksa had been investigating under the Money Laundering Act.
He was addressing a press conference at the Plantation Industries Ministry auditorium. Responding to a question raised by media personnel whether the MPs' arrest were results of political victimisation, he said some can interpret the legal actions in that way, but arrests were made with clear evidence in hand.
He queried if the government could keep silent for fear of rumours and leave the thieves at large.
The law is applied equally to all, he said.
Dissanayake said his father was charged on the instructions of former President R. Premadasa on the alleged abduction of Prof. Ralph Buultjens in 1988.
The minister said there was not a single evidence against his father. He said despite the AG's instructions not to charge, the President instructed to file a case. "But court acquitted my father," the minister said.
He said it tarnished the image of President Premadasa. Likewise, if a case is filed against a member without evidence, it will harm the government, the minister said. The government will not file false cases knowing that such action will tarnish its image, he said.

Playing with words
Words are easy for politicians and in politics, depending which class is involved. Take the word, the people for example. It came with the democratic revolution where masses in large numbers participated in mass actions. Its hard to think of a term that has been abused since.
It is in the name of the people all things done. In the feudal society, things were done in the name of the country or the sovereign. Now its all in the name of the people isnt it Then the nation replaced the country and has a lot of utility value, and has been used and abused all over the world and across history; and then, with franchise and democratic debates emerged the civil society.
Organised working class
Civil society can be loosely defined as the aggregate of non-governmental organisations and institutions that manifest interests and will of citizens and includes the family and the private sphere, referred to as the third sector of society, distinct from government and business. In other words it represents the large middle class that seek independent within bourgeoisie regime and the organised working class. It is supposed to give identity to hopelessly divided middle class. Hence refers to a community of citizens linked by common interests and collective activity and as such implies all manner of collectives, regardless of size.
However in usage it is the emphasis of this definition that dominates. Its useful, to say collective activity, for political purposes. In usage, it would (like to) count every single unorganised citizen who is not a TU member, politician or a business owner. Perhaps this is why those who call themselves representatives of civil society see civil society as an alternative to trade unions and governments.
Of course one can raise the question what really is civil society in Lanka How representative are those who claim to speak on behalf of those, whose memberships are generally assumed. When in the past society was dominated by racist black hundreds, civil society with the help of left oriented trade unions, organised protests mostly at Liptons Circus. These were peace demonstration or rather demonstrations for peace, meaning agitation to put a stop to military repression of Tamil liberation struggle and to go for political solution to the Tamil national problem. Most of the key voices in that civil society collective were and still are ardent advocates of power sharing, some occasions endorsing moves to direct talks between the LTTE and the Government of Sri Lanka. Some of these peace demonstrations were organised by womens organisations. Interestingly some times these were organised by 100 womens organisations getting together. However under the condition of fascistic terror some times less than 100 turned up!
Major political parties
It is true that captains of peace industry too worked within the norms set by the major parties in the country. I was, and I am a dedicated fighter for liberation of Tamils. But if am asked to come for a demonstration beyond Slave-Island I will request transport and something to fill the empty stomach. Hence civil society generally collected money from donor organisations to mobilize mass campaigns. But it should be noted; almost all who came to anti war campaigns, did so daring to face death. Hence when asked from a civil society person, on the sidelines of talks between the then government and the LTTE in Celigny, Switzerland, how many people he could bring to a demonstration if he didnt receive funds from donor agencies. He was honest. None, he said. Membership, even temporary membership, has a price tag then. Yes, not too different to the rice packet, alcohol and a few hundred bucks plus transport that are spent to purchase support for the two major political parties in the country, one observes. Yes, these are the norms set by corrupt fascistic ruler of the country.
Civil society, however, assumes the kind of purity (of purpose, work and practice) that politicians in the past had, some even today dare not demand or, as of late, would not bother claiming. On the one hand, politicians seek and obtain votes. They are up for election. They are up for rejection. So are the activists in the civil society. Those who are not committed and have no social liberation vision will be exposed in the struggle and pushed out; and in the end nobody to help and nobody remember.

President requests private institutions: Lets join to save power by switching off lights used for advertising, decorations
President Maithripala Sirisena requested all private institutions to help save power by switching off lights used for advertising and decorations at their institutions.
The President pointed out that the country has to face a power crisis in the future due to the drought and therefore it is the responsibility of all to use the power in an economical manner from now.
A huge amount of power is utilised for advertising boards and other decorative electrical systems used by private institutions at nights, for their advertising purposes. Through limitation of this usage, a significant amount of power consumption of the country could be saved, the President pointed out.
He requested everyone to support the initiative until the drought ends.

Reconciliation, peace achievable only if justice is meted out: Wigneshwaran
Reconciliation and sustainable peace can be achieved only if justice is meted out to the long standing injustice suffered by the people, Northern Chief Minister C.V. Wigneshwaran said.
The Northern Province Chief Minister was speaking during a discussion with Political, Trade and Communications Counsellor of the European Delegation in Sri Lanka and Maldives Paul Godfrey.
Godfrey along with several officials attached to the European Union visited Jaffna yesterday.
Chief Minister Wigneshwaran said he had informed the EU officials that there is a strong need to implement initiatives to uplift the lives of war widows and Ex-LTTE cadres and added that the officials had agreed to extend their support.
No skills based training was provided to Ex- LTTE cadres during the reconciliation programmes. No opportunities were provided to continue their normal life.And if any problem occurred in the area, the police immediately arrested them. This situation has to change immediately. Measures have to be taken to give them recognition, the Chief Minister said.
Wigneshwaran stressed that investigations related to the alleged war crimes have to be conducted and added only if justice is meted out to all, the injustice that occurred during the war that there would be sustainable peace and reconciliation. He further said many issues can be addressed if adequate political powers are given.
Several people strongly oppose the concept of power devolution. I have told the officials that by creating awareness among the people about the positive aspects of devolution of power, many prevailing problems related to the Tamils can be easily solved,he added.

The World's eighth wonder, Sigiriya, had become vulnerable to destruction due to its improper maintenance and conservation.
The Central Cultural Fund deploys over 300 employees to control and maintain the Sigiriya Fortress, but they have failed in their duties.
Service of 65 resident labourers had been terminated recently and new ones were recruited. However, they have not been provided with proper lodging facilities, sources said.
The Central Fund charges an entrance fee of about Rs.4,900 from a foreign tourist and Rs. 50 from a local tourist. But maintenance and conservation of Siririya is not up to the expected level, the sources said.

Turning obstacles into opportunities
Life without limbs yet without limits; Obstacles bring opportunities; What you become by achieving your goals is far important than by achieving goals. Attitudes and Environments are the root causes of a dis-Abling population; Alter life by altering attitudes. Stop wishing and start doing.
The only person keeping us from reaching our full potential  is our own self as False Evidence Appearing Real manifests FEAR to hold us back.
International motivational
speaker Nick Vujicic.
These are words of wisdom that have inspired me to write this eye opener.
Nicholas James Nick Vujicic (pronounced Voo-yee-cheech) is an Australian (35), born in Melbourne to Serbian orthodox emigrant parents from Yugoslavia.
Janis (pronounced Yanis) McDavid is a German (25), born in Hamburg. We both met here soon after last Christmas, to share over two hours our thoughts and experiences.
Nick and Janis both were born with no legs, no arms, but that could not dampen their spirits.
They both are two people who had overcome significant physical limitations  made into obstacles by others in same society - to achieve greater success and live as productive citizens.
They both have faced challenges head-on, surmounted extraordinary odds, turned their dis-ability into a blessing and proved again and again that: Ability (of all) is much stronger than dis-Ability.
They both believe that everyone is worthy being treated with respect and dignity; This in turn is also an inherent right to enjoy.
Affording opportunity to be heard - regardless of the degree of ones ability  is now a legal obligation and moral duty of the government of Sri Lanka and a prerequisite for inclusivity and equality of treatment.
Ability is stronger than dis-Ability
Nick has atiny deformed foot. He use his toes as fingers to grab and turn a page; and his foot to operate an electric wheelchair, a computer and a mobile phone.
Janis looked up at me, extended his stump of an upper right arm in greeting, and smiled. Hi, I'm Janis.
He gently takes the edge of his glass of water between his lips, lifts it with the help of this short right arm and balances it there while he drinks.
He writes with his mouth holding the pen between his molars - (see the photo) and drives a specially modified van. Nick is a Bachelor of Commerce graduate from Griffith University in Queensland with a double major in financial planning and accountancy.
Janis is an undergraduate studying business economic at the University of Witten / Herdecke. He believes education is the key to open peoples mind that had also helped him to gain knowledge and develop creativity.
Nick never thought he would find love. Four years ago he was blessed to marry Kanae Miyahara - a wonderful devoted wife. The couple has two sons and they now live in Southern California.
When only 17 years, Nick formed the non-profit organisation Life without Limbs and in 2007 founded Attitude Is Altitude (AIA) - a company dedicated to spark passion, kindle hope, ignite positive change and thereby to empower people across the globe in transforming their lives.
Nick and Janis, they both are authors and motivational speakers.
Nick has started his mission in using his restricted-ability - what most of us still call often as dis-Ability - to start conversations that change lives.
Over the past 15 years, Nick has spoken in more than 50 countries not only of his own life story but on topics as varied as inspiring positive change, persistence and determination.
We all do things differently. Janis McDavid writes using his mouth.
Nick is the author of several books and that includes; Life without Limits (2010): Inspiration for a Ridiculously Good Life, that has been translated into more than 30 languages and; Stand Strong (2015): You Can Overcome Bullying.
He also markets a DVD for young people titled No Arms, No Legs, No Worries!
In 2009 Nick also starred in the short feature film The Butterfly Circus and for his starring performance was awarded Best Actor.
Janis speaks at conferences and workshops to motivate people to focus on the positive side and to concentrate on the power within themselves to achieve great things.
His book: DeinBestesLeben (Your Best Life) is a top seller in Germany.
He joins German Parliamentary sub committees as an expert on promoting wider acceptance of people with dis-Abilities.
Mind openers
What is different in persons - even with no arms no legs - who find success in situations where others often might fail
Achievements are far more appreciated when they are accomplished with apparent significant physical limitation in ability. It takes courage for any normal man to achieve an outstanding feat when he lacks something important in daily life; it requires extra-ordinary effort and commitment continuously for a person with a serious physical limitation to level the fame. Few people are successful in situations where others would have given up. They surmount with determination and perseverance hurdles that lead others to fail.
How have these people managed to succeed in the face of adversity They all have ambition -- but I have found there is much more in them.
Lessons Nick and Janis teach
First Believe that WE CAN! They both firmly believe: strengths outweigh weaknesses (that we all have).
Nick communicates one core message that  no matter your circumstance, YOU CAN overcome adversity!
We have a choice: To be angry and cursing for what we have lost or dont have or thankful for what we do have. There are several things in life out of our control that you cannot change and you have got to live with. The choice we have is either to give-up or get-up and keep going.
We all can take only one step at a time and just keep doing that.
Along the way you are sure to fall down. Then just get-up each time you fall down and keep going. If you fail and you give-up, you shall then never get-up. So keep trying again and again and again.
As long as you try and try again, there is always the chance of you getting-up. There is still hope as long as you keep trying. Hope is strength to live.
Are you going to believe in yourself or everybody elses judgement on you The fact is that often people put you down. People even dont look you in the eye.
Effort never dies not until given-up
Core message of Janis is that even under difficult circumstances it is possible to make the impossible possible. This is true for all of us.
As an adolescent, Janis has hopped up stairs and avoided going out in public without a wheelchair. But he had ultimately realized that his embarrassment was an additional unwanted limitation, as were bad moods.
Getting upset about lot of such things that we have no control about, Janis had soon realised wouldn't do him any good.
Avoiding failure is to avoid progress.
Nick and Janis make sure to remind themselves frequently not to get dis-heartened and give-up when somethings do not work well as expected.
FAIL  is first attempts in learning
Of course a lot will go wrong and often it does for every one of us. In real world we all do things differently and that is normal.
Setbacks should not be allowed to frustrate us too deeply so we could bounce back to continue with greater resilience.
What is really important is to achieve the desired goals well but not the way of doing things. Remember, there are several ways to succeed in todays society.
The burning desire should be to constantly learn and try out new things and new ways. We need to experiment to do things differently in a way that best suits us in particular circumstances.
The self-discipline to constantly overcome barriers to move ahead and not to dwell too much on failures other than to identify the root causes.
UNSEEN ENEMY - dont dis-Able us
Nick, Janis and many others have shown how they enable themselves to live a life anyone else would live, provided the built environment do not make them dis-ABLE.
Yes, dis-Abling built environments  our unseen enemy - are a colossal waste of resources Sri Lanka no more can afford, especially when over 20% of our population, for different reasons, find their abilities often restricted.
All of us are abled differently and that too keeps changing. When entrances, doors, steps and toilets are rightly designed, people are empowered to live up to their optimum potential enabling them to become productive employees, entrepreneurs and consumers, along with everybody else. Its a low cost investment with rich dividends for everyone.
It is important to think about the design of buildings  that includes places of education, bookshops, shops, toilets at hotels and hospitals in particular, restaurants, banks and ATMs - so that no one gets dis-Abled and marginalised but, everyone is equally catered for and equal access is assured to all.
This is also paramount for services and businesses to grow and achieve their optimum potential.
Let us ensure that physical infrastructures, public facilities and services, at least, under new Mega-polis agenda INCLUDE, not Exclude, Everyone.
Of course to prevent colossal wastes of resources, proper advice and close guidance are essential prerequisites here.
Inaccessible tourism denies new profits for Sri Lanka
International theme for 2017 is Accessible Tourism but, still, permitting man-made physical and social obstacles to grow, Sri Lanka is wasting resources and preventing becoming the destination of choice for a generation destined to transform the travel, hotel and tourism industry.
Finally, with my 17 years of wide experiences, I confirm what Eleanor Roosevelt has said: You wouldnt worry about what others think of you if you realized how seldom they do.
Yes, most of us are NATO men - No Action Talk Only!
(Dr. Ajith C. S. Perera  a professional - is the pioneer accessibility activist here and a widely experienced accessibility adviser promoting over two decades of time the theme: Ability (of all) is much stronger than dis-Ability. Please see: goo.gl/wPeOax)

UNDP, Biodiversity Sri Lanka enter into collaborative partnership
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Sri Lanka and the Biodiversity Sri Lanka entered into a collaborative partnership with the UNDP as its first associate member. It is to enable the UNDP Sri Lanka and the Biodiversity Sri Lanka to build a long lasting relationship to enhance biodiversity conservation performance by the country's corporate sector.
The Biodiversity Sri Lanka (BSL), an entirely private sector owned and driven platform, with 63 corporate entities, was established to promote strong engagement of the corporate sector in biodiversity and environmental conservation issues in Sri Lanka. Leveraging on the competitive advantages of the BSL and the UNDP, this partnership will now enable both entities to contribute substantively to influence the policy arena, both public and corporate, in using best practices in conservation standards and sustainable development.
UNDP Sri Lanka Country Director Jorn Sorensen said: "The partnership is a promising and innovative collaboration that has enormous potential to energise efforts towards biodiversity conservation for sustainable human development.
Both organisations had identified potential areas of engagement and a set of joint activities on policy innovation, social innovation initiatives, SME engagement, environment sustainability and disaster resilience, tourism and bio diversity.
Biodiversity Sri Lanka Director Board Chairman Dilhan C. Fernando said: The Biodiversity Sri Lanka looks forward to forging a successful working partnership with the UNDP to actively involve the private sector in taking forth the national biodiversity conservation agenda.
The UNDP Sri Lanka and the Biodiversity Sri Lanka will develop this new and exciting partnership as a best practice for other organisations to follow and join hands for similar causes.

UNP determined to abolish Executive Presidency: Harshana
The UNP is bound and determined to abolish the Executive Presidency, UNP MP Harshana Rajakaruna said.
"Abolishing the Executive Presidency, being one of the key issues on which the last presidential election was fought, we are obliged to keep the promise," he said.
He made these comments at a media briefing at the Government Information Department yesterday.
"President Maithripala Sirisena at the Sri Dalada Maligawa and at the funeral of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhita Thera made an oath to abolish the executive presidency. He must abide by this," Rajakaruna said.
Asked on the SLFP claiming the opposite, Rajakaruna said those ministers have not properly gone through 'Maithree Palanayak'.
"Even though certain SLFP ministers claim their personal views on abolishing the executive presidency, the SLFP as a political party has not made such an announcement," he said. "It was the UNP that prepared the manifesto along with the President. This is why we introduced the 19th amendment to the constitution." he said.
Speaking on the restoration of GSP+, UNP MP Wijepala Hettiarachchi said the Joint Opposition is trying to diminish the importance of the facility. "The Joint Opposition wants to make people forget as to why we lost the GSP+ facility in the first place. It is because of the single-minded Rajapaksa regime that we lost it. We only have to restore what the previous government did not, such as, good governance, media freedom, democracy and sustainable development," Hettiarachchi said. Hettiarachchi said the Joint Opposition was trying to come up with groundless allegations to mislead the people that the GSP+ facility as unworthy. "There is no such thing as 50 or so conditions laid out by the EU. What they refer to is about the 27 conventions that Sri Lanka as a country have already signed to." Hettiarachchi said. The Yahapalana government will not give into unfair international demands or let the country be separated, he said. "We shall not allow anything that will harm the culture and values of the people of this country." Hettiarachchi said. He said the Joint Opposition is on a mission to rescue individuals involved in crimes and corruption.

We Can produce an Asian champion in billiards within one year - Ameer Mukhtar
Sri Lanka produced the first World Champion in 1973 when M.J.M.Lafir won the World Billiards title, 23 years before we won the World Cricket crown in 1996. Even though we were at worlds best level in billiards long before, the sport has been neglected along with its champions for so long. The annual billiards nationals is the only event that has been recognised by the sporting fraternity and conducted by the national governing body, Billiards and Snooker Association of Sri Lanka (BSASL) under great difficulty with a lesser media exposure.
Ameer Mukhtar is a well known personalty in not just Sri Lankan, but in the world billiard scene who has vast experience as a national level cueist, coach and a referee. He is the one and only Sri Lankan to obtain Gold certificate in international refereeing .
Mukhtar took to sports during his school days at St. Benedicts and Zahira College, Colombo. He was into athletics, soccer, rugby, wrestling and judo. He stepped into billiards accidentally. Mukhtar was selected to the Sri Lankan team which participated at the 1962 Asia Youth Soccer Championship in Thailand.
He had a knee injury during the match against Iran which forced him to exit from soccer.
Then I stepped into billiards in 1970 and mastered the cue sport as a player. I represented national team from 1991 and quit my playing career in 2016.
I played for YMCA and later obtained the membership of Moors SC and Automobile Association. My first big break as a billiards referee was in 1991 where I served as a referee and a team manager at the 7th Bell Masters Snooker Championship in India. The Asian Billiards and Snooker Association accepted me as a referee in 1988. I obtained the Asian Silver and Gold Certificates in 2009 and 2011 respectively.
The most precious achievement of my career is obtaining the International Gold Certificate in 2014. It facilitate me to officiate top level tournaments all over the world, he explained.
Mukhtar has contributed a lot for Sri Lankan billiards and works as the chief referee since 2000. He has officiated 15 Asian tournaments and 8 World Championships including two occasions as chief referee in Asian championships.
Commenting on present state of Sri Lankan billiards Mukhtar said due to some key issues, the sport has not developed into its full potential. Lack of coaches and not having a proper practice venue have left the sport in despair.
We brought down two international coaches, spending nearly Rs. 1 million to train our cueists. But the BSASL is not in a position to spend such big money continuously. Even though Sports Minister pledged his support in uplifting billiards, things have not materialized as yet. At least if we have a permanent practice venue, we still can uplift the sport, Mukhtar further said.  I have the need, capacity and courage to help uplift billiards as I love this sport. If the necessities provided, I can mould an Asian champion within an year.
There are lot of talented players, but must provide with right guidance and techniques, Mukhtar concluded.

Wheels move on Horana tyre factory: Navin
The process of setting up of the tyre plant in Horana has not been suspended, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said yesterday.
The minister said there was no truth in the rumour that Sri Lanka's largest fully integrated tyre manufacturing plant of which the foundation stone was laid by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe recently, had been suspended by the President. He made these observations at a press conference at the Plantation Industries Ministry auditorium.
He said work on the factory was in progress.
Dissanayake said the setting up of the factory would benefit the country's rubber cultivation and in turn the country's economy.
"I don't mind as to where the money is from and who owns the money as far as the money is invested in the country," the minister said.
"The banks take the responsibility of the money. They would not accept black money."

## Title: Why Obama mattered

Why Obama mattered
When I reflect on Barack Obama's term as President of the United States, the word that comes to mind is monumental.
I grew up as an American-born Sri Lankan in the United States. My Sri Lankan family was used to not seeing people like ourselves on television, in positions of power or in offices of government in the U.S. White faces dominated these places, and for many years, few were able to break through. Growing up, I remember learning about the Founding Fathers of the United States: George Washington, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin to name a few. They were the proud creators of the United States who we were taught to admire. Yet these fathers looked nothing like my own father, born and raised in Sri Lanka and brown-skinned like me. Over two hundred years had passed and 43 presidents had been selected that looked like those Founding Fathers, yet none of them looked anything like me.
Not excluded
President Obama's election to office was the first time many people of colour in the U.S. could finally feel that they were no excluded from the highest office in the country because of the colour of their skin. After years of racism, segregation, exclusion, discrimination and oppression, people of colour (the term used to describe minority races and cultures) finally felt their voice counted, and they can be represented in the ultimate arena of American government.
The social impact of having an African American citizen elected to President gave the African American community an unfathomable sense of hope and achievement. It was evident in the tearful yet smiling faces of audience members during President Obama's first inauguration. Many who had been the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of former slaves brought forcibly from Africa described how their elders never thought the day would come when an African American person would be able to take office and lead the country. Washington D.C. burst at the seams as thousands came to witness the first African American man to be sworn into office.
Change
When President Obama was inaugurated in January 2009, he inherited a country that was in the depths of recession. Many of Obama's dissenters still try to blame him for the slowed economy in his first years in office. But the economy had been crushed by years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Citizens who had been pushed by risky home loans were losing homes they could not afford and many people were being laid off from work at an alarming rate.
President Obama was able to turn the country's course and as of his last week of office, unemployment is well under half of what it was when he began. Most of the troops abroad have been able to come home again. He was able to create a new programme to allow more people to access healthcare in the U.S. While not perfect, it has helped more people to access preventative and long-term care and may have even brought down the rate of abortions in the country as more women have access to free birth control. As a clinical psychologist, I see directly how expanded government healthcare for the poor and disabled have helped many get help who would otherwise by debilitated by their mental illness.
Besides the economic and legislative changes President Obama successfully made, he brought a sense of finesse and grace to the White House that the previous administration lacked. He referred to members of the press not by their first names or nicknames, but as Mr. or Ms. The themes of his speeches were positive and inspiring even in the face of conflict, danger and tragedy. He spoke firmly, but with respect to his opponents and welcomed the new president-elect to the White House despite a very contentious election. President Obama was able to offer avenues of peace and renewal with long-standing enemies of the U.S. While many pugnacious critics decried President Obama for reaching out to Cuba and Iran after many years of sanctions, he reached out to seek solutions rather than more threats and posturing.
President Obama's family was an admirable example of a typical American family that just happened to also live at the White House. He was a model father to Sasha and Malia, who had the difficult job of growing up under the extreme spotlight of the White House. He acknowledged the challenges imposed on them many times in speeches, both in seriousness and jest. He welcomed his wife Michelle's mother to the home to help raise his daughters, mirroring many of the multigenerational households in the U.S. The candid pictures of him and Michelle Obama in affectionate moments were a testament to their lifetime partnership, even under the stress of being the President of the United States.
Approachable
Both President Obama and Michelle Obama gave the appearance of being approachable, hip and humorous. Mrs. Obama was not afraid to get up and dance with schoolchildren to encourage them to exercise and eat healthy. She could joke and participate in skits with talk show hosts. President Obama was able to crack jokes and poke fun at himself in front of the press. He was also a good sport when it came to political satire. In a popular comedy skit show Key and Peele, President Obama is portrayed with his normal calm, collected demeanour by comedian Jordan Peele. What is assumed to be his repressed, angry side is embodied by Luther, his Anger Translator portrayed by partner comedian Keegan-Michael Key. Rather than expressing indignation to the comedic pair for their colourful portrayal of the president's repressed anger during challenging situations in office, he embraced it.
He actually invited Key to the Annual White House Correspondents Association's dinner where Key, as the character Luther accompanies the President to help the press interpret how the President really feels about them. Luther is eventually is interrupted by the President himself who takes his anger into his own hands. Luther has to comically hold back the President and stop him before he goes too far. This unexpected skit showed a humorous side of President Obama that no other President had expressed in quite the same way.
The future president has a very high bar set for being the personable, approachable president that Barack Obama was. I am glad to have been able to witness Obama's presidency and look forward to seeing future presidents of colour and maybe even a female president in America's future.
