Young Storms Queensland for EZY Racing
Sunshine Coast, Queensland: Sri Lankan based EZY Racings Mike Young produced yet another scintillating display of driving to fight off an early challenge from local favourite Nathan Quinn to win EZY Racing their second podium finish in as many races, in the 2016 FIA Asia Pacific Rally Championship (APRC), concluded here in the Sunshine Coast of Australia.
With the rains beating in over the weekend, the International Rally of Queensland, Australia, came to a close sooner than expected. The weather however did not dampen the hopes for the EZY Racing duo, Mike and Malcom, who managed to secure third overall at the International Rally of Queensland, the second round of the FIA Asia Pacific Rally Championship 2016.
The Queensland leg, consisting of two days of racing across special stages in the Sunshine Coast, began with roads significantly varying between dry on Saturday and slippery on Sunday in which the team was forced to carefully manage their strategies throughout the weekend. The team started the first stage on Saturday on soft compound tyres expecting the terrain to be wet as it was on the race day. Young soon realised that the conditions were much dryer and struggled to set competitive timings in the first four stages of the day as the soft tyres hindered the pace.
Coming into midday break, Young was positioned fourth behind the MRF Skoda team mates and Quinn. With Young opting to change the tyres into a harder compound tyre for the four stages post mid-day session, the 23-year- old battled to gain third place from Quinn and challenged Fabian Kreim from the MRF Skoda team for second place in stage 8. With conditions drying out towards the latter half of the day, the EZY Racer demonstrated similar pace as shown during the first leg of APRC 2016 in New Zealand.
Young said It was a much better afternoon for us. Changing the tyres on the Cusco EZY Racing Subaru worked well and gave me so much confidence. We were basically going 40 seconds quicker during the afternoon stages than in the morning. It was a good afternoon with no mistakes.
Sunday however brought the team a different set of challenges with the weather taking a complete turn from the dry conditions on Saturday. Rally organisers were forced to cancel four stages on Sunday afternoon due to the inclement weather, much to the relief of many competitors including Young.
Other than the stage cancellations, Young and Read had no other major issues and the Cusco EZY Racing Subaru was faultless all weekend, which again contributed to their success.
The young Kiwi duo also wanted to commend the efforts of Cusco and EZY Racing for their unwavering support in their quest for an international championship. We really have to thank all the guys from Cusco and EZY Racing. Cusco gave me a perfect car, and the team from EZY Racing came all the way down here to support us and watch the rally. We wouldnt be able to do this without them, said Young.
Young admitted that his co-driver, Malcolm Read had an equally tough job because of the constant change of pace, and amendments to the pace-notes, schedule and rally route.
The elated CEO and Founder of EZY Racing, Shafraz Hamzadeen expressed Its another good day in office for us. Although we were hoping for dry weather which would have suited Mike's driving the best as he demonstrated in New Zealand, it turned out to be a mixed weather weekend. We tried to improvise with tyre strategies, that didn't go our way this weekend.
In reality everyone knows that this is the best result we can expect . Mike is just pushing the car beyond its possibilities to give the Skoda R5's a challenge and to see if we could force an error. Unfortunately we lost about a minute to Gaurav on the first four stages of the day. We are now looking at Japan where we kick off our Asia Cup Challenge with Cuscos new upgrades.
EZY Racing will be kicking off the Asia Cup challenge in Obihiro, Japan this September. The team had a great finish to last years Japan leg where they were driven to their very first international win with Young. Young drove brilliantly to finish second in Rally Japan and first in the Asia Cup, in which he classified as the toughest rally to-date, and saw extremely difficult conditions, with heavy rains.
The team looks forward in anticipation for an exciting challenge like last year in Northern Japan.

Shape of things to come in cricket
The future of international cricket is being shaped this week at the most significant ICC annual conference in recent times with 150 delegates from the 105 full, associate and affiliate member nations meeting at the Caledonian Astoria hotel in Edinburgh for six days of talks that commenced on Monday.
One of the key topics that will be discussed is the future of the Champions Trophy which has since its inception in 1998 gone through a rather rugged terrain and stands in danger of being scrapped after next summers tournament in England.
As part of discussions about the future of the international game, the governing body is discussing cancelling the 2021 Champions Trophy, awarded to India, and abolishing the tournament for good.
The tournament is seen as lacking purpose and a clear identity, especially if the ICCs proposals for a new 13-team ODI league, culminating in a play-off between the top two nations, are ratified. Alongside the league, the first edition of which is planned for 2019-22, and the World Cup, there is little desire to have a third 50-over tournament.
Three years ago the tournament underwent a mild shock when in the lead-in to the 2013 tournament the ICC announced that the 2013 Champions Trophy would be the last, with its place in the cricketing calendar being taken by a new ICC World Test Championship. However in January 2014 that decision was reversed, with the ICC confirming that the 2017 Champions Trophy tournament would take place and the proposed Test Championship was cancelled.
Whether the Champions Trophy can survive another tremor of that magnitude is very unlikely especially with the shortest form of the game  Twenty20 cricket gaining more ground and becoming quite popular among the younger generation of cricket followers.
Inaugurated as the ICC Knockout Tournament in 1998 and played approximately every two years since, its name was changed to the Champions Trophy in 2002. The number of teams competing has varied over the years. Originally all the ICCs full members took part, and from 2000 to 2004 associate members were also involved. Since 2009 the tournament has only involved the eight highest-ranked ODI teams as of six months prior to the tournament.
The tournament scheduled to take place in England next summer for the first time will not see the West Indies, winners of 2004 and the reigning World T20 champions. They were edged out in the ODI rankings by Bangladesh and failed to qualify.
England will be hosting the eighth and probably the final tournament for the third time in its history. Bangladesh, Kenya, Sri Lanka, India and South Africa have hosted it once each. The tournament has been won outright twice by Australia (2006 and 2009), and once each by South Africa (1998), New Zealand (2000), West Indies (2004) and India (2013). The 2002 tournament hosted by Sri Lanka saw the host country and India being declared joint champions after two unsuccessful attempts to complete the final had failed due to bad weather.
Among the other key items in a packed agenda are to raise the profile of bilateral 50-over internationals outside of World Cup years beyond 2019 with the creation of a 13-team international league; creation of a two-division Test league system  seven teams in the top tier, five in the bottom  that is hoped would add greater context to the current bilateral tours by feeding into a points system beyond the current rankings.
With the 50-over ICC Champions Trophy possibly phased out after the 2017 tournament there is a possibility that the shortest forms marquee event T20 would remain a biennial event with tournaments being staged in 2018, 2020 and 2022.
As well as urging greater consideration of how best to implement day-night Test cricket, the cricket committee has recommended the ICC take greater control of the decision review system (drs) with umpire calls on lbw reviews being relaxed  with 25% of the ball needed to be hitting the stumps down from 50% at present  and that incorrectly called no-balls be reversed by the third umpire.
With steps having already been taken to remove the permanent seats of the Big Three namely India, England and Australia on the ICC executive committee a further debate will follow regarding the overall model and distribution of funds. The Big Three structure of the governing body that was introduced in 2014 saw India, Australia and England take a leading role in running the global game, as well as a greater proportion of the revenues from global events.
It certainly is decision time for cricket as the ICC makes plans for the future of the game with the outcome of events of the Edinburgh meeting being awaited keenly by the worlds cricketing fraternity.

UAE: Desert Cubs Cricket Academy is once again gearing up for yet another stint in Sri Lanka from July 5 to 15 as part of its annual summer tour, and on this occasion will also face up to the new challenge of playing two day games against top quality school teams.
Speaking to Daily News, Presley Polonnowita founder and Head Coach, Desert Cubs Cricket Academy said, This year, the Academy will fly over 5 junior teams in the age categories of Under 11, 13, 15 and 18 to the Paradise Island.

Argentina begs Messi not to quit
Buenos Aires, Tuesday: Argentine football legend Diego Maradona and the countrys President Mauricio Macri urged Lionel Messi on Monday not to leave the national team despite his vow to quit after a humiliating defeat.
The Barcelona superstar left the field in tears after missing a spot-kick in the Copa America Centenario final shootout against Chile on Sunday.
He promptly told reporters he was quitting, throwing Argentine football into turmoil ahead of the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
He has to stay because he still has playing days ahead of him, Maradona was quoted as saying by La Nacion newspaper online.
He will go to Russia in form to be world champion.
Messi, 29, is widely rated as the best player in the world, but Sundays loss was his fourth defeat in an international final for Argentina. After an outpouring of disappointment by fans online, Macri joined the calls for the Barcelona superstar to stay with Argentina.
He called him and told him how proud he feels of the national teams performance and asked him not to listen to the criticism, a spokesman for Macri told AFP by telephone.
The 1986 World Cup winner Maradona, 55, blamed Argentinas recent lack of trophies on the countrys football association (AFA).
He accused it of not supporting Messi and letting him take the blame for Sundays defeat.
Those who are saying he should quit are doing it so that we wont see what a disaster Argentine football has become, La Nacion quoted Maradona as saying. Messi and the squad landed back in Buenos Aires on Monday evening after the tournament in the United States.
Television cameras followed their coach but the players had yet to make any comment to the media. Messi is loved in Barcelona but his friends complained of how harshly he has been judged in his homeland.
This lad is just saturated with criticism and being so badly treated, said Ernesto Vecchio, who was Messis first coach in his native city of Rosario.
I dont want him to quit but when I put myself in his shoes it seems unfair that they should look to him as the savior when there are 11 players on the team.
Messis cool head on the pitch makes him an efficient goalscorer, but his reserved manner has drawn criticism.
Ahead of this months Copa, Maradona himself accused Messi of having no personality for a captain.
Messi has been named FIFA World Player of the Year five times. But he has been haunted by comparisons with Maradona, who led Argentina to World Cup triumph in 1986.
The stars departure could herald a broader change in the Argentina line-up. Manchester City star Sergio Aguero warned other players could also quit the national side.
We were all devastated in the dressing room, particularly Leo, Id never seen him in such a state, he said. Several players are wondering whether to continue.
Aguero did not say whether he would follow Messi in quitting but he, Javier Mascherano and Gonzalo Higuain were mentioned in media reports.
Argentina were beaten 1-0 by Germany in the final of the 2014 World Cup and lost on penalties, also to Chile, in the 2015 Copa America final.
Messi also tasted defeat with Argentina in the final of the 2007 Copa America. In this months Copa semi-final win over the United States, he became Argentinas top international scorer of all time with his 55th goal.
But after Sundays final, his typical composure gave way to tears of frustration.
Ive done all I can, Ive been in four finals and it hurts not to be a champion, Messi told reporters.
Its a hard moment for me and the team, and its difficult to say, but its over with the Argentina team.
His departure left many fans no longer thinking about the Copa.
Losing a final is something that happens in sport, wrote one fan, Fede Ruiz, on Twitter.
But losing you is the most painful defeat of all. AFP

Iceland heroics bring England to their knees
Nice, Monday: Iceland's football Vikings fought back from a goal down to beat England 2-1 at Euro 2016 in one of the biggest shocks in the sport's history that forced the immediate resignation of England manager Roy Hodgson.
Wayne Rooney put England ahead from the penalty spot inside five minutes in Nice. Within another 75 seconds Ragnar Sigurdsson had equalised and in the 18th minute Kolbeinn Sigthorsson set England on the way to humiliation.
England never looked like getting back into the game and virtually the whole team slumped to the ground when the final whistle went. Iceland's players and fans erupted with joy at the country's greatest sporting moment.
Hodgson, 68, came out after the game to announce his resignation in a statement.
"I'm extremely disappointed of course about tonight's result and ultimately our exit from the competition. We haven't progressed as far as I thought we were capable of, and that's obviously not acceptable," he said.
"We are in the results business," he added. "Now is the time for someone else to oversee the progress of this young, hungry and extremely talented group of players."
Amid wild celebrations, Iceland took the last quarter-final place and will now face host nation France in Paris on Sunday.
Earlier, Italy dumped defending champions Spain out of the contest, winning 2-0 to end a 22-year run without a win over their rivals. Italy must next face world champions Germany.
England's performance ranks alongside some of the most dismal at major tournaments. England already feature on the list of shame with their 1-0 defeat to an amateur United States side at the 1950 World Cup.
Iceland's man of the match Ragnar Sigurdsson, who scored Iceland's opener, said England's over-confidence was behind their humiliating defeat.
"They thought this would be a walk in the park," said Sigurdsson. "But we had faith in our ability."
England, ranked 11th in the world, were left cursing a blunder by goalkeeper Joe Hart that led to the second goal by the world 34th-ranked Icelanders, the smallest nation to appear at a major tournament. Sigthorsson's tame shot squirmed past Hart for the winner.
Raheem Sterling was fouled by Iceland goalkeeper Hannes Halldorsson to lay on Rooney's penalty into the left corner to crown his 115th England appearance, which tied David Beckham's record for an outfield player.
But barely 75 seconds later, Iceland were level. A trademark Aron Gunnarsson long throw-in reached Kari Arnason who headed on and Sigurdsson volleyed the ball in from close range. Gylfi Sigurdsson and Jon Dadi Bodvarsson worked the ball to Sigthorsson and with England's defenders standing off, the Nantes striker rolled a shot goalwards that Hart did not get close to.
Former England captain Gary Linker called the result "the worst defeat in our history". He added on Twitter: "England beaten by a country with more volcanoes than professional footballers. Well played Iceland."
Another ex-captain Alan Shearer said the England performance was "pathetic."
Spain's coach Vicente del Bosque was also forced to fend off questions about his future after his defending champions lost 2-0 to Italy in Paris.
Giorgio Chiellini and Graziano Pelle scored as Italy exacted revenge for their 4-0 hammering by Spain in the Euro 2012 final.
The landmark victory set up an epic Italy-Germany quarter-final.
Chiellini forced home the first goal from close range after goalkeeper David de Gea could only parry Eder's fiercely struck free-kick. Pelle volleyed in a deflected cross in injury time to complete Spain's heartbreak.
"It has been and is a great era for Spanish football," said del Bosque.
"We have Italy ahead of us for the World Cup qualifiers in Russia and we have to prepare for that," he added.
"I don't think an era has ended. Spanish football is very well structured -- there are good academies, very good players and very good clubs."
Italy manager Antonio Conte said team work and a united spirit that England could not muster had inspired their win.
"Right from the outset since I took over I have said that the only route forward to achieve a semblance of success is to try and be a like a club team," said Conte, who will take over Chelsea at the end of the tournament. "We have to be a collective." AFP

MR govt ruined economy by borrowing Rs. 9,000 b: Kavinga
The Rajapaksa government which failed to establish monetary discipline, ruined the economy of the country after obtaining Rs. 9,000 billion worth of loans, UNP Parliamentarian Dr. Kavinda Jayawardena said.
He was addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday. During their rule, individual liabilities reached up to Rs. 500,000 from Rs. 133,000. Moreover, Rs. 13 billion was needed for each week to run the country, he said.
The MP pointed out that the then government failed to utilise state funds efficiently due to poor financial management.
He added that during the latter part of the then government, short term loans worth Rs. 50 billion had been obtained. As the general practice, short term loans should be settled promptly, but the Rajapaksa government did not stick to that norm, Dr. Jayawardena said.
Whatever the members of the joint opposition say, all this indicate how the economy was ruined during the then government, he said. Dr. Jayawardena said as a consequence of the better financial management of this government, the country will receive Rs. 30 billion annually through exporting fish products since this government was able to lift the fish export ban.

Thomians line-up semi-final clash with Royal
Milo knockout Trophy contenders S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia thrashed Zahira College Maradana by 43 points (7 tries, 4 conversions) to 10 (1 try, 1 conversion, 1 penalty) in their quarterfinal match played at the Royal Sports Complex, Reid Avenue yesterday. The Thomians led 19-7 at the breather.
It was an awesome performance orchestrated by Thomian speedy left winger Naveen Henakankanamge and dazzling number eight turned full back Danuja Wijeratne where each of them scored three breathtaking tries in each half.
The Thomians amply demonstrated why they should be considered one of the front runners for the Milo knockout title by putting on a fabulous display of fast open rugby through their fleet-footed three quarters. Zahira on the other hand struggled with their tackles and were totally dominated in the set pieces by the Thomians.
Even though the Thomians could not win their own throws in the line outs, their entire three quarter line totally dominated the game simply overrunning the opposition at every given opportunity.
S. Thomas opened scoring in the 13th minute, when off a penalty tap their full back Danuja Wijeratne went over the line for a try. Ashvantha Herath missed the conversion and S. Thomas led 5-nil.
In the 21st minute of play Zahira grab the lead, when off a turn over ball their hooker Mohamad Elyaz crashed through for a try which full back Nirhan Gunawijaya converted to make it 7-5 in favour of Zahira.
Off a ruck in the 28th minute Thomian fly half Hans Walpola gave a beautiful off load to Wijeratne who dummied his way over for a try. Herath made the conversion for Thomians to regain the lead 12-7.
In the 41st minute off a penalty tap the Thomian number eight Shanive Ahangama send a timely pass to Wijeratne who once again touch down for a brilliant try fending off eight Zahirian defenders to score mid left. Herath made the conversion to increase the tally to 19-7 at half time.
After the turn around in the 49th minute, Zahira scored off the boot of Gunawijaya who slotted a 35-metre penalty to reduce the lead to 19-10.
In the 60th minute off a sweeping three quarter move Henakankanamge scored a brilliant try under the post after a breathtaking 80 metre run. Herath made the conversion to extend the Thomian lead to 26-10.
Henakankanamge scored again in the 72nd minute through another 30-metre run to touch down for a try mid left. Herath slotted the conversion to increase the score to 33-10.
In the 76th minute off a scrum inside their 22 Thomian scrum half Shenal de Silva made a superb chip kick into the hands of winger Henakankanamge who collected the ball and darted down nearly 70 metres to score his third try of the match near the right corner flag. Herath missed the difficult conversion but S. Thomas enjoyed a hefty lead of 38 points to 10.
The Thomians sealed the match in injury time, when off a ruck, replacement player Abeetha Pilapitiya crashed through for a try near the left corner flag. The difficult touch line conversion was missed by Herath but it did not make much of a difference as the scoreline read a runaway 43-10.
The win secured the Thomians a semi-final clash with traditional rivals Royal College on July 3.
Referee D. Nimal had an excellent game with the whistle.

Morgan urges England to maintain Sri Lanka focus
LONDON, TUESDAY: England captain Eoin Morgan wants his side to keep their concentration when they continue their one-day international series against Sri Lanka at The Oval on Wednesday.
Morgan's men are 1-0 up with two to play in the five-match campaign after rain just four overs into their innings stopped them building on a good bowling display in the third ODI at Bristol on Sunday.
England and Sri Lanka played out a thrilling tie in last week's first ODI at Trent Bridge before the hosts stormed to a 10-wicket win in the second match of the series at Edgbaston.
It all leaves England with work still to do if they are to win the series, following their 2-0 victory in the preceding three-Test campaign against Sri Lanka, and they could face further frustration at The Oval if rain forecast for south London duly arrives at Surrey's headquarters ground.
It's certainly going to be one of the challenges over the next couple of games we play, said Morgan at The Oval on Tuesday.
With a lot of weather around, that is always a huge challenge that it doesn't become a distraction -- and to switch on when we need to.
We want to play as much cricket as we can, and I suppose (the weather) has halted a little bit of the momentum we've had, the former Ireland batsman added.
Tomorrow is about regaining that a little bit.
Many of Morgan's team-mates were watching on television as England's football team suffered a humiliating exit from Euro 2016 following a 2-1 defeat by minnows Iceland in Nice on Monday. While attention now turns to a replacement for Roy Hodgson, who resigned as England manager on Monday, Morgan's team have shown that improvement can happen after exiting a major tournament.
England's cricketers suffered an embarrassing group-stage exit at last year's World Cup following a defeat by makeweights Bangladesh in Adelaide.
But with Australian Trevor Bayliss replacing Peter Moores as coach, a new-look England side adopting an aggressive approach have enjoyed some notable successes in limited overs cricket, including reaching the final of this year's World Twenty20.
The learning experience we've had over the last 12 months, with the new group of players, has been so significant that there is almost a completely different team, said Morgan.
I suppose for us, it was going with a new method and a new group of players.

Proteas fall prey to Silvas left-arm spin
Maliyadeva Kurunegalas slow left-arm spinner Damitha Silva instigated a sensational collapse as South Africa lost their last seven wickets for 43 runs on the opening day of the second under 19 test at the Welegedara Stadium in Kurunegala yesterday.
South Africa looked set for a big first innings total when openers Ricardo Vasconcelos (53) and Joshua van Heerden (81) put on 101 for the first wicket and skipper Wisan Mulder contributed a fine half-century (63) to place them on a firm footing at 201-3.
But Silva after an unsuccessful first spell of 13 overs which yielded 39 runs without a wicket struck a double blow in the first over of his second spell and with good support from Ashen Bandara continued the decline of the South African batting to finish with figures of four for 56.
Six of the Proteas batsmen fell to leg before decisions (four to Silva) as South Africa who won the toss and batted first were dismissed for 244 by the close

Kyrgios loses cool, wins on Wimbledon return
LONDON, TUESDAY: Nick Kyrgios was back in trouble on his return to Wimbledon as the Australian rowed with umpire Mohamed Lahyani and told his entourage to get out during a stormy 6-4, 6-3, 6-7 (9/11), 6-1 win over Czech veteran Radek Stepanek on Tuesday.
Kyrgios has earned a reputation as one of the most volatile players on the men's tour after a series of distasteful antics, including briefly appearing to stop trying during his Wimbledon defeat against Richard Gasquet last year.
The temperamental 21-year-old, who was hit with a $2,000 fine for swearing during the same last 16 clash with Gasquet, lost his cool yet again on his first return to the All England Club since that meltdown 12 months ago.
He was warned for bad language by Lahyani following an audible rant that included telling his support team to stop watching him after he lost the third set.
Despite his latest petulant display, Kyrgios insisted he provided great entertainment for fans. The crowd likes the way I play here, I entertain. I'm comfortable here and they know the tennis I bring every day, he said. I knew I had to be on my game, I couldn't lapse at all. It was a tough match.
Kyrgios has struggled to stay out of trouble through his career, so there was plenty of attention on the world number 18 when he strolled onto Court AFP

Gammanpila cannot use patriotism as a cloak to hide his frauds: Warnasinghe
MP Udaya Gammanpila cannot cover up his frauds and corrupt acts by hiding behind patriotism, politics and the Sinhala Buddhist ideology, Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) national organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said.
He was addressing a press conference at the JHU Office at Battaramulla yesterday. He said some groups were trying to misinterpret the arrest of Gammanpila as a political witch-hunt.
Let the law take its own course. This matter is devoid of politics. It involves an Australian business partner whom Gammanpila worked with. Even some print media are backing Gammanpila in a shameless manner without giving fair coverage to both parties, he said.
Warnasinghe said according to details received by the JHU office, there was evidence to prove Gammanpila had been jailed on a previous occasion too.
Gammanpila had been in Welikada prison for three days after he was produced before the Fort Magistrate on December 5, 1997 over a financial fraud at Delta Consolidated Pvt Ltd. Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Media Spokesman Thushara Dissanayake had told a newspaper that he would unconditionally beg pardon from the nation if it was proved that Gammanpila had been in jail before. Now it is time for him to do what he said and we ask him to resign from his post too, he said.
Warnasinghe said certain groups were trying to tarnish the image of Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka by using this matter, adding that he has no connection whatsoever in the arrest of Gammanpila.
Ven. Hedigalle Wimalasara Thera said they had written to the IGP asking for a fair investigation over the statement by Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera during a press conference held by Pevidi Handa Organisation recently, that Minister Ranawaka had leveled death threats to a certain individual who had defected to the other side.
