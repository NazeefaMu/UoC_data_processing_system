Does anybody care for Kandys Football 
The Kandy Association Football League (KAFL) is 91 years old. The football lovers who served as officials and players say today football is not what it was in the past.
Although football has its root in Kandy for over 150 years, with the KAFL formed in 1925, and Kandy being one of the founder members of the Sri Lanka Football Federation (that time known as the Ceylon Football Association).
Although Kandy had one of the biggest leagues with over 40 teams in three groups, A, B and C, even the people who are involved in Kandy football don't know when football was started in Kandy. Sadly, the 2015 event the one and only tournament organized as a knockout, and the final of that was played in 2016
The FFSL, made a big show in Kandy, saying Kandy will get a modern football stadium at Dangolla, through the FIFA , foundation stone was laid. Now nearly 18 months have lapsed and nothing has moved. The proposed venue is a pint sized ground and how they planned to put up a international stadium is inexplicable.. Football is in the doldrums over here in Kandy mainly due to the alleged mismanagement and controlling body not showing any interest. A look back into Kandy football reveals that football in Kandy had its origins in the mid 1920's during the 2nd world war when the British Units stationed in Kandy, with the onetime Commander in Chief of Allied Forces in South East Asia, Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten had his headquarters in the hill capital played the game.
Firstly it was Kandy District Amateur Football League formed. It subsequently changed its name to Kandy Association Football League. It served football in Matale, Gampola, Nawalapitiya, Kurunagala and Kegalle, and as the years rolled by, these towns formed their own leagues. When Football in Colombo and elsewhere received a setback as far as Ceylonese exponents of the game were concerned, the game was more or less confined to cater for football enthusiasts among the permanent population as well as to the Services.
In the FFSL's premier league competition now on, sad to say no club from Kandy is participating. Holding office, for prestige is not what is required now, but they must come forward and do things. to promote the game. Today most of those holding office are only keen in coaching and refereeing for a handsome packet. If football in Kandy is to improve the Controlling Body must put the leagues in the correct path.
It was first class athletics at the inter school zonal meet which was worked off at the Bogambara stadium under the distinguished patronage of Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake. In which Trinity College merged as the boys champions with 432 points and Mahamaya Girls College with 428 points were girls champions. Boys second place went to Dharmaraja College 288 points, third St. Anthonys College with 187 points followed by St. Sylvesters College 127 points, Vidyartha College 100 points and Sri Rahula 70 point.
In the girls second place was taken by Swarnamali BV 126 points, Girls High School third with 124 points and the rest in order Good Shepherd Convent 119 points, St. Anthomys Convent 177 and Pushpada Balika College 95. Antonain A.R.C. Weewardena was the best athlete of the event, he timed 48.6 seconds in the 400 meters D.T.A. de Silva of Swarnamali BV who clocked 25.2 seconds in the under 19 200 meters was the best athletic in the Girls., O.A. Dalpadado was the winner of the under 17 best athlete award and A. Almeida of Good Shepherd Convent won the under 15 girls award. A big hand should go to the Director of Education Central Province E.P.T.K. Ekanayake and his able staff for organizing a good meet.
Jayatilake takes over Kingswood rugby
D.U M Jayatilake has been called to coach his old school at rugby, a well-known physical trainer took the side before their traditional match against Wesley College for the Blaze trophy. This time they have lost all the matches they played and now the Kingswoodians are being demoted for the second round matches and will be playing in the Plate competition and their first game is against Prince of Wales. One of their old boys a top center three quarter Chamra Vithanage will continue as the trainer. So, much is expected from the new coach can he turn the table is the question
Very good performance is expected from Kandy schools in the second round of the inter school rugby season, please keep in mind no easy games, should play well, for that defence is great then superb attacking threat and execution!
This time in the first round matches of some failed to clinch a spot in the cup competition. Trinity College playing in the Division I segement I A were placed third, they only lost two games out of the five and now they are in the cup competition, and will play their first second round game against Science College.
It was nice to see St. Anthonys College playing in the Division I Segment I B , did well in the last two games after losing the first three in a row , and now they are promoted to the top division after three long years. Will now play along with Trinity College in the Cup competition in the second round, their first games against St. Thomas College.
This time Kingswood College and Dharmaraja College both schools played in the Division I Segment 1B suffered heartbreaking losses and are now in the Plate competition. Many blame the style of play and poor squad selection. But it is time to have a look deeper than that in order to understand the root of the problem. Kingsdwood plays their first second round game against Prince of Wales and Dharmaraja will play Mahanama College.
St. Sylvesters College who played in the Division I Segment  1C  are the only unbeaten team from Kandy, have won all the five games and now play St. Johns in the second round Bowl competition, and Vidyarhta played in the Division I Segment 2A lost only one game out of the 5 are also in Bowl and will play Lumibini in their first second round game., they fell short of 0 . 5 points, to be promoted to Division I

Speaker orders special inquiry into Harins alleged use of foul language
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said in Parliament yesterday that he ordered a special inquiry into the alleged use of foul language by Minister Harin Fernando in Parliament last Wednesday.
He made this observation in reply to a Point of Order raised by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena.
MP Gunawardena bringing the attention of the House towards the matter said the conduct of Minister Fernando was a clear violation of the Standing Orders. Minister Fernando used lewd words to insult MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage.
This is type of behaviour is very obnoxious. The minister used un-Parliamentary language. The Speaker or any other MP can check the video footage and see for themselves. The Speaker should take some action on this minister. Recently, even the Australian Prime Minister was ordered out of the Chamber by the Speaker, he said. The Speaker said that he had already paid attention towards the matter.

Dinesh requests special debate over prevailing emergency situation
MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday requested a special debate in Parliament over the prevailing emergency situation in the country due to floods and landslides.
He urged the Prime Minister to convene a special sitting of Parliament next week to discuss this matter.We are deeply concerned over the prevailing situation. Life rescue missions are going on. Loss of lives, a possible spread of various diseases leading to a possible epidemic and damages to property and businesses have been reported in many parts. Therefore, we urge the Prime Minister to facilitate an urgent debate on the national disaster situation, he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe proposed to wait for a complete report from the Disaster Management Ministry to proceed in this regard. I have ordered the Disaster Management Minister to produce a full report. Let us have this discussion based on this report, he said.
At this point, the Prime Minister in rather a sarcastic tone reminded that such a disaster would not have taken place, had not the Joint Opposition smashed coconuts at Kovils.
State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe rising to a Point of Order requested Joint Opposition MPs to go to the field and assist the affected people, adding that holding a debate in the House would not be of any help for relief distribution work.
He said the Government has decided to pay compensation for all damaged houses irrespective of whether those are illegal constructions or not. MP Gunawardena at this point stated that they do not require any invitation to go to the ground and assist the people.

No threat to Ambatale Water Treatment Plant - Hakeem
Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage Minister Rauff Hakeem told Parliament yesterday, that there is no threat to shut down the Ambatale Water Treatment Plant at this moment resulting in water cuts to Colombo and adjacent areas.
Excerpts from the message:
Making a special Ministerial statement, the Minister said that several social media sites have reported the Ambatale new intake had been closed, but these reports are false.
Due to flood waters rising in the Kelani river, the Ambatale new intake had to be kept under careful observation for the past few days. Only if the water level reaches 23 feet, we may be compelled to completely shut it down to 19 feet by early morning today. We have also kept the necessary water pumps on standby to pump out water seeping into the pump house and the Navy's assistance in this regard must be appreciated. Due to the natural phenomenon of the sea level increasing during the last two days before Poya and 2 days after the Poya reaching its peak during Poya Day, we are closely monitoring the high tide that is being reported. Last morning, there was a 0.4 metre rise in the sea level observed between 3 and 4 am. It is reported tomorrow being Poya and it may rise up to 0.5 metres. In such a situation, discharge of water from the river would slow down and the rising water level could be observed. With the receding flood levels, I could confidently say that it would not reach the critical 23' which would necessitate any shut down of the Ambatale New Intake. We must also assure consumers that there is no truth to the rumour that the Kelani river water had been severely polluted with oil. We have been constantly checking the water for impurities and could guarantee the quality of water that had been treated and supplied to consumers.
As a result of the unusually heavy rainfall and the flood situation during the last few days, many of our water intakes have been damaged and filled with mud and silt. In addition, the power supply interruption and landslide situation have caused disruptions to the water supply.
In order to overcome the situation, we have cleaned and repaired most of the intakes and where necessary, obtained the assistance of the Sri Lanka Navy for cleaning operations. Further, diesel operated generators have been utilized to maintain a minimum supply. Actions have been taken to provide temporary storage tanks and supply water through bowers to hospitals, other essential institutions and camps provided for displaced persons.
All our Regional Officers and the Provincial Regional Support Centres are coordinating with the relevant Disaster Management offices, District Secretariat and Divisional Secretariats to maintain water supply to essential areas and to ensure at least the minimum water supply needed.
In order to maintain the safety of water supply, NWSDB has increased the level of residual chlorine in the systems and also strengthened the Water Quality Surveillance mechanism by deploying Chemists and other relevant staff.
NWSDB is constantly coordinating with the Department of Irrigation and Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka in order to minimise water levels in rivers and reservoirs, so that response plans could be initiated. Further maintenance and repair gangs have been mobilized to face any unexpected emergency situations. In Avissawella, intake pumps were submerged since yesterday. Due to reseeding water levels the situation will be rectified today.
There is no issue in Kethhena WTP and Kandana WTP located along the Kalu Ganga. Hence, there is uninterrupted water to Kalutara and Panadura.
In the Western North region, the following situations have arisen due to flooding.

Anderson and Broad skittle out Sri Lanka for 91
LEEDS, FRIDAY: Sri Lanka were one without loss, following on in their second innings, at stumps on the second day of the first Test against England at Headingley on Friday.
Dimuth Karunaratne and Kaushal Silva were both unbeaten on nought after just two balls, including a lone leg bye, were possible in Sri Lankas second innings before the umpires called an early close because of bad light.
Sri Lanka ended the day 206 runs behind after being skittled out for 91 in reply to Englands first innings 298.
James Anderson took five for 16, his best Test figures at Headingley, including a spell of four for one in 29 balls.
New-ball partner Stuart Broad took four for 21 in an innings that was completed inside 37 overs.Only Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews (34) and Lahiru Thirimanne (22) offered any sort of resistance with the bat.
Wicket-keeper Jonathan Bairstow held five catches after scoring 140 -- his first Test century in England -- on his Yorkshire home ground earlier Friday.
Stuart Broad sparked a Sri Lanka top-order collapse as England took charge of the first Test at Headingley on Friday. Sri Lanka were 43 for three at tea on the second day, 255 runs adrift of Englands first innings 298 which featured Jonathan Bairstows 140 on his Yorkshire home ground.
Dinesh Chandimal and Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews were both 15 not out in testing, overcast conditions. Broad, the worlds number one-ranked Test bowler, needed just 12 balls to take his first wicket on Friday.
Coming from round the wicket, Broad had Dimuth Karunaratne out for a duck as the left-handed opener edged an excellent delivery that nipped away through to wicket-keeper Bairstow.
Kaushal Silva, Sri Lankas other opener, was caught behind off a sharply rising ball from James Anderson for 11.
Kusal Mendis, like Karunaratne, fell for a duck when he edged Broad and gave Bairstow his third routine catch of the innings.
Sri Lanka were now 12 for three, with Broad having taken two wickets for no runs in three balls. Those early Sri Lankan wickets also highlighted the value of Bairstows runs -- and how costly it had been for Sri Lanka to drop him on 70, half of his eventual score. Mathews -- whose Test-best 160 laid the platform for Sri Lankas win at Headingley two years ago that clinched their first series win in England -- defiantly cut Broad through point for four. But he was almost undone by the last ball before tea, with occasional medium-pacer James Vince producing a spiteful delivery that leapt off a good length.
England resumed on 171 for five, having collapsed to 83 for five on Thursday.
Hales and Bairstow took their sixth-wicket stand to 141. But there was no maiden Test century for Nottinghamshire opener Hales.
Dropped on 82, he was out for 86 when, losing patience after nearly five-and-a-half hours concentration, Hales holed out off left-arm spinner Rangana Herath. Moeen Ali and Broad both came and went, with Bairstow in danger of running out of partners before he got to three figures.
But an overthrown three saw Bairstow to his second Test century and first in England following the Yorkshiremans 150 not out against South Africa at Cape Town in January. AFP

Djokovic, Nadal lined-up for 50th meeting at Roland Garros
PARIS, FRIDAY: Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal could meet for the 50th time after they were placed on a French Open semi-final collision course on Friday.
World number one and top seed Djokovic, who turns 29 on the opening day of the tournament on Sunday, needs a Roland Garros title to complete a career Grand Slam after losing three finals in four years, including last season to Stan Wawrinka.
Should Djokovic and nine-time French Open champion Nadal meet in the last-four it will be their 50th career clash in a rivalry which began in 2006 at Roland Garros.
Djokovic has the edge at 26-23, claiming the pairs last seven encounters.
Fourth seed Wawrinka is scheduled to take on second seed Andy Murray in the other semi-final.
Top seed Djokovic, bidding for a 12th career major, starts his campaign against Taiwans Lu Yen-Hsun, the world number 100 who made the Wimbledon quarter-finals in 2010.
Djokovic is seeded to face Tomas Berdych in the last-eight while he could tackle volatile Australian Bernard Tomic in the fourth round.
Tomic was accused by the Serb of lacking commitment after a tame exit at the Madrid Masters last month.
Nadal, who lost to Djokovic in the quarter-finals in 2015, had originally been set to be seeded at five until 2009 champion Roger Federer withdrew through injury on Thursday.
Nadal starts his French Open against big-serving Sam Groth of Australia with a potential quarter-final against home hope, and two-time semi-finalist, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.
With his 30th birthday just around the corner, Nadal has arguably the toughest draw of the top men but will be buoyed by a recent return to form which saw him claim the Monte Carlo and Barcelona titles.
Italys Fabio Fognini, who came back from two sets down to beat Nadal at the US Open last year, is a possible third round opponent.
Rising Austrian Dominic Thiem, the man who knocked Federer out in Rome, is lying in wait in the round of 16.
- Serena eyes 22nd Slam - SUB HEAD
Murray, fresh from beating Djokovic in the Rome Masters final, will meet a qualifier in the first round with a potential quarter-final against Japans Kei Nishikori.
Murray has been handed a relatively smooth path although a mouth-watering clash with Nick Kyrgios of Australia is a potential last-eight match-up should Nishikori stumble. AFP

I know that Jacques and the rest of the team have set an initial target of qualifying for the quarter-finals and I will do all that I can to give the team the best possible start.
Its also a valuable opportunity to get some overs under the belt in the lead up to the South Africa Test series in a controlled T20 environment. AFP
