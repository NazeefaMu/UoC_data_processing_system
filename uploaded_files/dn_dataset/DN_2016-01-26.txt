Asia shivers, slips and slides in record low temperatures
ASIA: Snow, sleet and icy winds across Asia caused deaths, flight cancellations and chaos over the weekend as areas used to basking in balmier climates struggled with record-low temperatures.

Weather-related deaths were reported in Japan and Taiwan, with hundreds of flights cancelled across the region, tens of thousands of holidaymakers stranded in South Korea, and freezing conditions in sub-tropical Hong Kong causing mayhem on its tallest peak.
While the cold snap is by no means on the scale of the weather now affecting the snow-bound eastern United States, such temperatures are a novelty for many residents of the region.
In Bangkok, a city that rarely sees the thermometer dip below 20-25 deg C, temperatures dropped to around 16 deg C on Sunday (Jan 24) and Monday (Jan 25).
It left people in Bangkok, whose normal attire generally includes flip-flops and shorts, digging through their closets for jackets and jumpers.
In Japan, five people died and more than 100 were injured on Sunday, with record-breaking heavy snowfall and low temperatures in the country's western and central regions and rare snow in subtropical areas, officials and local media said.

The small subtropical island of Amami observed snow for the first time since 1901, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. In China, 24 weather stations around the country recorded all-time low temperatures between Friday and Sunday.
At Eergu'Na in Inner Mongolia, the temperature on Saturday hit a record low of minus 46.8 deg C.
The southern city of Guangzhou saw rare sleet, the first in 60 years, in its downtown area, the provincial meteorological station announced on Sunday.
In Hong Kong, primary schools and kindergartens were closed on Monday after temperatures plunged to a 60-year low.
A 100-km ultra-marathon race was abandoned as competitors crossing the city's tallest peak, Tai Mo Shan, slipped on icy slopes buffeted by freezing winds.
The peak became the scene of "carnage", as one race official described it, as hundreds of curious "frost-chasing" citizens became stranded, with dozens stricken with hypothermia and hapless firemen called in to rescue them filmed slipping and sliding on the icy roads.
Close to 90,000 people were stranded on the South Korean resort island of Jeju on Monday after the biggest snowfall in three decades shut the airport for the third straight day.
Taipei registered a low of 4 deg C over the weekend, the coldest in 44 years, with the Taiwan media reporting 90 deaths due to the cold weather, and rare snowfall drawing enthusiastic crowds to Yangmingshan National Park.
In Vietnam, temperatures in Hanoi dropped to six deg Celsius at night over the weekend, which state-run media said was the coldest weather the country has experienced for some two decades.

Britain and Bill Gates announce 3 b to eradicate malaria

UK: Britain's Finance Minister and tech billionaire Bill Gates unveiled Monday a plan to spend billions to eradicate "the world's deadliest killer" malaria.
Chancellor George Osborne and Gates announced 3 billion ($4.28 billion, 4 billion euros) in funding over the next five years for research and to support efforts to eliminate the mosquito-borne disease, in a joint article in The Times.
"When it comes to human tragedy, no creature comes close to the devastation caused by the mosquito," the two wrote.
"We both believe that a malaria-free world has to be one of the highest global health priorities."
The fund would be made up of 500 million a year from Britain's overseas aid budget for the next five years, as well as $200 million this year from The Gates Foundation, with more donations to follow.
There were 438,000 malaria deaths in 2015, most of them of children aged under five, and the majority of them in Africa, according to the World Health Organization. Efforts to control the disease have made significant progress in the last 15 years, but are threatened by the spread of resistance to antimalarial drugs and to insecticide, the WHO said in its World Malaria Report 2015.
"If new insecticides are not introduced by 2020, the situation will become critical and deaths could surge," Osborne and Gates wrote, adding that fighting diseases required collaboration between private companies, governments and charities.
"We are optimistic that in our lifetimes we can eradicate malaria and other deadly tropical diseases, and confront emerging threats, making the world a safer place for all," the article concluded.
Microsoft co-founder Gates has turned his attention from software to fighting disease and other ills around the world with his wife, under the auspices of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
The charity has disbursed more than $28 billion and provided funding for the world's most clinically advanced malaria vaccine, Mosquirix developed by GlaxoSmithKline. Mosquirix, or RTS,S, is the first malaria vaccine to reach Phase III clinical testing -- the final stage before market approval -- and the first to be assessed by regulators. It received a nod from European regulators in July. A WHO expert panel in October recommended pilot roll-outs of the vaccine to young children in several areas of sub-Saharan Africa, before considering wider use.

FAMES PRICE
Following the steps if the highly successful Moulin Rouge Rob Marshalls Chicago pinpoints on the life of show girls and celebrity life in the busy Chicago city but sadly it lacks the full bodied texture embodied by the forerunner.
Velma, Billy and Roxie
Chicago relates the story of Roxie Hart who dreams about making it big in show biz but ends up in prison after murdering her boyfriend. The action begins with her watching in starry eyed wonder while headliner Velma Kelly performs on stage in a jazz club. Roxie is desperate to be in Velmas place and is even ignorant enough to get caught to a man who claims that he can make her a star in exchange for sex. An infuriated Roxie shoots him in her bedroom once she realizes that he is a fraud. She is bundled off to jail and then realizes that the murder trail is her one way ticket to fame.
Broadway drama
When she becomes a celebrity overnight with the help of a playboy lawyer named Billy Flynn she incurs the shame of her henpecked husband Amos and the jealousy of Velma. Each of these important episodes unfurl followed by a track. All of the musical numbers in Chicago serve the storyline well. They imply that the incidents are pieced together for entertainment purposes just like a Broadway drama. Fame and fortune are not ever lasting and you have to make most of your time in the limelight to reap your rewards.
Unlike most movies made during the era Chicago is clearly not a biography or a love story. It focuses on media sensationalized criminal trials which develop to resemble a circus in which, if the defendant plays her cards right, she could achieve stardom. It goes along with the movies tag line If you cannot be famous, be infamous.This is exactly what Velma and Roxie does with the help of the lawyer, the press and the abused excuse.
Media puppeteer
Similar to Bob Fosse and Fred Ebbs 1975 musical Broadway adaptation of Maurine Dallas Watkinss play, Chicago, Marshalls movie projects a jazz-and-liquor milieu coming alive via sexy song-and-dance. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Rene Zellweger, Richard Gere, John C. Reilly, Queen Latifah, Christine Baranski, Taye Diggs, Dominic West, Lucy Liu, Deirdre Goodwin and others who have performed movies of other genres give commendable performances in techniques that may be new to them. Zellweger and Gere give an exceptional act in the number They Both Reached for the Gun, where Gere becomes the literal mouthpiece for Zellwegers character and a puppeteer of the media. Another standout is Queen Latifahs piece When Youre Good to Mama.
Though she is a rapper by profession Latifah shows that she is more than capable of handling a serious role like Matron Mama Morton.
One of the disappointments of Chicago is the fact that Zellweger and Zeta-Jones are not given ample opportunity to form a proper relationship till curtain call.
Setting the two killer damsels on screen together would have been a dazzling spectacle but unfortunately screenwriter Bill Condon has not taken pains to flesh out a relationship between the two leading ladies.
Screen space
Marshall has not explored the glitz and glamour of the settings of the films 1920s Chicago environ in his movie. Instead the background mostly comprises of people, costumes and mannerism used in the era. Both Zellweger and Zeta-Jones carry off their roles well but out of the two only Zellweger has been given space to snuggle into her character. Thus she comes across as more vulnerable and even sexier than Zeta-Jones. Though Zeta-Jones plays an extremely important role in the plot, her character has not been given enough screen space for the actress to develop her character. Therefore she is a pale comparison to Zellwegers Roxie.

'Formulate strategies now to make SLFP victorious in future'

As members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), what we should do today is take the party forward, without trying to protest and go behind individuals, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
Addressing a 'jana hamuwa' in Anuradhapura on January 24, Minister de Silva said that individuals may come and individuals may go, but the party must continue forever.
Minister Silva said the breaking up of political parties is a common feature in Sri Lankan politics: "The same thing is being attempted today. But we should not allow anyone to break up the SLFP," he said, explaining that while a conflict of ideas and tension could be seen within the party, conflicting ideas could be witnessed within the government too, because it was a coalition of two parties; "we should try to iron them out and reach a consensus within," he said.
Minister de Silva said therefore, awareness should be made among grassroot level supporters of the SLFP, to have them know that the party did not promote a single individual and his or her ego, and so, they should steadfastly unite under a single banner, without focusing on individuals.
"We should formulate strategies from now on to make the SLFP victorious at future elections. We should march forward according to the principles and the programme of the party," he said.

Germanys Kerber powers into Open quarter-finals

MELBOURNE, MONDAY: Seventh seed Angelique Kerber thumped compatriot Annika Beck to win an all-German clash and reach the Australian Open quarter-finals for the first time on Monday.
The 28-year-old, who had a stellar 2015 but underachieved at the majors, eased past Beck 6-4, 6-0 and will play either two-time champion Victoria Azarenka or Czech Barbora Strycova in the last eight.
The first set was certainly close, up and down. I just tried to be aggressive and take my chances, said Kerber.
Im very happy to be in the quarters for the first time. Im looking forward to my next match and lets see how far I can get.
Kerber was a form player coming into Melbourne Park, winning four titles last season -- second only to Serena Williams, who claimed five -- but she failed to translate that to the Grand Slams.
She was sent packing in the third round or worse at all four majors, with her quarter-final appearance here the best she has managed in nine attempts in Melbourne.
Kerber opened this season with a run to the final of the Brisbane International, where Azarenka beat her, but struggled in her opening match here, surviving a match-point scare.
But the left-hander has been steadily getting better, with Beck, ranked 55, always the underdog, having only once beaten a top 10 player -- Simona Halep in 2014.
Beck, the French Open junior champion in 2012, seemed overawed by the occasion and quickly lost her opening serve as Kerber dictated the baseline battle with some heavy hitting.
The more experienced German comfortably held her own serve before Beck settled down and started getting into the contest.
She began matching Kerber from the baseline and created five break points in the fourth game, finally converting with a delicate backhand chip.
But it was a short-lived advantage with Kerber immediately breaking back.
Neither player could hold serve as they traded breaks in an energy-sapping clash before Kerber came through a brutal rally for a 5-4 lead when Beck slammed a backhand into the net.
Kerber finally held her serve to take the first set in 60 minutes.
The talented but unproven 21-year-old Beck was in the second week of a major for the first time in 14 career appearances, and experience was clearly a factor in the second set.
Kerber stepped it up a notch, forcing a growing number of errors from Beck, who slapped a forehand long to be broken in her opening service game.
It only got worse as Kerber pushed her opponent around the court, quickly racing to a 5-0 lead as Beck lost the plot, with a net volley allowing Kerber to become the first German to reach the last eight in Melbourne since Andrea Petkovic in 2011.

Glorious Giselle!

The DVD screening of Giselle, a ballet in two acts will be held at the Russian Center, Colombo, on January 29 at 3.30pm. It will be subtitled in English. Entrance free.
Natalya Bessmertnova, Bolshoi Company prima ballerina over three decades, performs splendidly in the title role for this worthy and largely successful attempt at recovering, within a studio setting, many past glories from a truly classical (as well as romantic) ballet. Filmed at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, an appropriate site for one of the Bolshoi's most admired pieces, the performance benefits quite strongly from the lack of applause that is normally tendered by live audiences revelling in infatuation for individual favourite dancers, bringing productions to a halt.
A great leaper, Bessmertnova is alike successful with acting, specially to be noted here in the Act I mad scene, while the emotional forcefulness of her partner, Mikhail Lavrovsky, as Count Albrecht decidedly contributes toward the stirring presentation of the work's sundry musical climaxes. Juri Grigorovitsch, husband of Bessmertnova, creates here continually challenging choreography, a manifest blend of past Bolshoi triumphs along with his own innovations, and although the popular Peasant Pas de Deux from the end of Act I was completed during this production, one will forgive its subsequent removal as not being concordant with an elegiac mood that the choreographer establishes immediately upon progression into the second act.
This mood becomes the most dynamic element of the film, enhanced through smoothly achieved artistic montage and lighting effects from cinematographer Konstantin Apriatin.
During the more than a century and a half of Giselle's history, a good many sterling dancers have performed as Albrecht, but few who could maintain the role's cardinal accent upon emotional strength with the force that does Lavrovsky in this film.
And it is Lavrovsky, in company with Grigorovitsch, who provides the artistic casing that enables Bessmertnova, justly celebrated for her interpretation of the tragic innocent, to reveal only the merest hint of that romantic sense of mystery that comprises Giselle.
Bessmertnova's emotive skills, and her technique throughout, up until her final seconds with Albrecht by her grave (while she displays a perfect arabesque penche) never seem well-trod during the course of this excellent Kultur VHS release. Adolphe Adam's score, less than gratifying for the concert hall but note perfect for the ballet, with each number apt to the gifts of well-schooled dancers, is performed without a clinker by the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra ably conducted by Alygis Zhyuraitis. Regal Galina Kozlova, as Myrtha, Queen of the Wilis, dances with her customary efficiency, and the corps is correctly trained for a balletic event wherein cultural homage is paid not only to the choreography of Petipa but to the costumes of Bakst as well.

Lacking the Katniss factor

The greatest science-fiction films, like the greatest horror films, usually channel the sublimated terrors of their era. Metropolis expressed fears about the class divide back in the 1920s. Invasion Of The Body Snatchers turned the 1950s' communism-related paranoia into an eerie metaphor.
Anxieties over the space race became a dominant theme in science fiction from Sputnik to Alien. And the urge to angst over whether any given new form of technology will wither our humanity is as old as the genre, and as new as Ex Machina's fresh take on the theme. Which is part of the reason an alien-invasion drama like 'The 5th Wave' feels so fundamentally hollow. The film, which adapts Rick Yancey's bestselling 2013 young-adult novel, doesn't tap into any particular collective concern, or into any ideas larger than a one-foot-in-front-of-the-other action-adventure. At best, it tries to tap into the way the Hunger Games books and films turned embattled teen-girl heroes into a profitable cinematic movement, and Twilight turned teen love triangles featuring dangerous, exotic boys into a craze. It feels more commercially conscious than culturally conscious: it's out to build a franchise and an ensemble of tough, lovable characters capable of selling another two films. But that means it's working from a familiar framework about teen empowerment in crisis. And the film version doesn't have many distinctive elements to flesh out that framework, or to make this look different from any of the other dystopian post-apocalypse novels that have flooded teen-lit shelves over the past decade.

Miss Universe to push HIV awareness after crowning blunder

PHILIPPINES: The new Miss Universe, back in the Philippines after an epic televised blunder surrounding her crowning, said Sunday she would use the attention the incident attracted to campaign for HIV awareness, especially in her home country.
In front of an estimated one billion television viewers worldwide last December, pageant host Steve Harvey mistakenly announced Miss Colombia, Ariadna Gutierrez, as Miss Universe before correcting himself minutes later.
The diamond and sapphire crown was removed from the head of a sobbing and humiliated Gutierrez and transferred to Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach of the Philippines.
Wurtzbach, speaking to reporters about her plans, said she would undergo a public testing for HIV when she returns to the United States where the Miss Universe Organization is based, to erase the stigma surrounding the disease.
Its about time someone like me should step up and hopefully others would follow suit as well, Wurtzbach, 26, told AFP.
I think in the Philippines, theres a bit of a stigma because were a conservative country.
The Philippines reported a 22 percent increase in HIV infections year-on-year in September last year. Four in ten of the new cases were reported in the capital Manila.
The nation of 100 million people, on whom 80 percent are Catholic, is heavily influenced by the church which frowns on contraceptive use. Testing for HIV is also considered taboo.
In the very few minutes she stood at the back of the Las Vegas stage at the end of the pageant, Wurtzbach said she accepted being first runner-up as a huge crowd of disappointed but proud fans in the audience waved Filipino flags.
I told myself, I fell short, what a waste. But its okay. I did everything I could and the most important thing is everybody is proud of me, she said. That was until Harvey admitted his unprecedented gaffe.
I was so happy. I was so excited. I couldnt describe it. It was something the Philippines has been waiting for for a long time.
Wurtzbach said she stood by her statement during the pageants interview question, that Filipinos welcomed the return of US soldiers to their former bases in the Philippines.
The Americans have always been our friend, weve always worked with them... I dont think theres anything wrong with asking for help when we need it, she said.
Beauty pageants like Miss Universe have cult followings in the Philippines and former titleholders go on to lucrative careers in movies and modelling.
It was the Philippines first title in 42 years and the third since the pageant started in the 1950s.
Her one-week long homecoming itinerary includes a grand parade around Manila on Monday, courtesy calls on President Benigno Aquino and both houses of parliament and a concert at one of the capitals biggest indoor stadiums.
Wurtzbach had been modelling since she was 11 and played bit roles in movies and television, but her entertainment career never hit the big league until she won Miss Universe. She lost in the local contest twice before earning the right to represent her country in the pageant.
The Filipina-German, with her smouldering gaze, said she dreams of becoming an Bond Girl in future 007 movies.
Wurtzbach, who is rumoured to have dated the 55-year-old Aquino, said she would stay single to concentrate on her duties as Miss Universe and pursue her Hollywood dream.
This is my boyfriend for now, a beaming Wurtzbach said, as she clutched the porcupine-shaped crown on her head.

Over 50 ex- LG members in Kurunegala say will contest under new front

A group of over 50 former SLFP local government members including former chairmen and vice chairmen of Pradeshiya Sabhas in the Kurunegala district said they would contest the forthcoming local government elections under a new political front formed under the leadership of Kurunegala district Parliamentarian and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. They made this announcement at a press conference in Kurunegala yesterday.
Ibbagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha former SLFP chairman U.K.Sumith Udukumbara addressing the press conference said all former SLFP Pradeshiya Sabha members in the Kurunegala district have decided to contest under a political front led by the former President because people supporting the SLFP at grassroots level were demanding them to do so.
He said the common man had no confidence in the present SLFP.
"As former people's representatives we could not go against the people's wish," he said.
Udukumbara said they would pressurise the government to hold the Local Government elections soon as there was no earthly reason to postpone the election.
Polgahawela Pradeshiya Sabha former chairman Livera Gunatilleke said the SLFP which was formed with the grouping of the five fold forces had today become a party torn with jealousy, hatred and enmity and revenge.
"We would definitely contest the forthcoming elections under the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa notwithstanding any possible disciplinary action taken against us by the SLFP General Secretary," he said.
Gunatilleke alleged that certain SLFPers who won the general election by riding on the back of Rajapaksa were today undermining SLFP supporters after obtaining ministerial and other posts in the government. Among those who attended the press conference were Dhammika Hettiarachchi, Ranjith Wijenayake, D.M.Sumansiri, Raj Sisira Kumara, Thushara Sanjewa and Abdul Sattar.
However, former Mayor of Kurunegala Gamini Peramunage, former chairman of Kurunegala Pradeshiya Sabha Patrick Kumarasinghe, Mawathagama Pradeshiya Sabha former chairman Upul Perera, Ridigama Pradeshiya Sabha former chairman Kumari Pallemulla, Panduwasnuwara Pradeshiya Sabha former chairman Ananda Jayalath and Alawwa Pradeshiya Sabha former chairman Bandara Wettawa were conspicuous by their absence at the press conference.

Rabada strikes as SA seek win

Centurion, Monday: First innings hero Kagiso Rabada struck two early blows as South Africa pushed for victory on the fourth day of the fourth and final Test against England at SuperSport on Monday.
England, set an unlikely target of 382 on a deteriorating pitch, were 52 for three at the close after South Africa declared their second innings on 248 for five.
Rabada, who took seven for 112 in the first innings, dismissed Alex Hales and Nick Compton, while new ball partner Morne Morkel claimed the wicket of England captain Alastair Cook for the second time in the match.
If South Africa are able to take the remaining seven wickets on Tuesday it would be a consolation victory, with England holding a winning 2-0 lead in the series.
Hales made only one run before he received a virtually unplayable ball from Rabada which shot through low and trapped the batsman in front of his stumps.
It finished a disappointing series for Cook's latest opening partner. Hales made 136 runs in eight innings at an average of 17.00.
Cook did not last much longer before pushing back a return catch to Morne Morkel after scoring five.
Compton was next to go, for six, edging a drive against Rabada to be caught behind by Quinton de Kock. Compton sought a review which showed a clear edge.
It could have been worse for England. With South Africa using two spin bowlers in fading light, Root, on ten, survived a stumping chance off Dane Piedt, with De Kock fumbling a ball which turned sharply.

LEBANON: The Islamic State group released a video Sunday purporting to show nine jihadists behind the November Paris attacks that killed 130 people, in which they threaten "coalition" countries including Britain.
The video posted on jihadist websites is entitled "Kill wherever you find them", and shows four Belgians, three French citizens and two Iraqis said to be responsible for the attacks.
French special forces evacuate people, including an injured man holding his head, as people gather near the Bataclan concert hall following fatal shootings in Paris, France, November 13, 2015.
The video posted on jihadist websites is entitled "Kill wherever you find them", and shows four Belgians, three French citizens and two Iraqis said to be responsible for the attacks.
In it the jihadists, speaking in French and in Arabic, say their "message is addressed to all the countries taking part in the (US-led) coalition" that has been fighting IS in Syria and Iraq since September 2014.
The video also shows a picture of British Prime Minister David Cameron accompanied by the words in English: "Whoever stands in the ranks of kufr (unbelievers) will be a target for our swords."
The video, produced by IS's Al-Hayat Media Centre, describes the nine jihadists as "lions" who "brought France to its knees".
The footage shows images of the coordinated Paris attacks as well as security operations by French special forces during the onslaught.
It also depicts the nine jihadists carrying out atrocities, including beheading and shooting people described as hostages.

SC directs all parties to file written submissions

The Supreme Court yesterday directed all parties to file written submissions in connection with the Special Determination petitions filed challenging the constitutionality of the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill.
When the two petitions were taken up for argument, the Supreme Court three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice K. Sripavan, Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice Anil Goonaratne directed the petitioners and the Attorney General to file written submissions in Court on January 29. The Supreme Courts determination over the issue is to be communicated to the Speaker.
One petition had been filed by Attorney-at-Law Nuwan Ballantudawa and he sought a declaration that bill shall become law only through a two-third majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum.
The petitioner said the Bill of Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) presented to the Parliament and placed on Order Paper of the Parliament on January 12, 2016. The Petitioner states the clauses 2, 3, 4,5,6,7 of the Bill are in violation of and are inconsistent with Articles 3, 4, 10, 12(1), 12(2), 14 and other Articles of the Constitution.
The petitioner further stated that clauses 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the said bill are infringing the franchise of the Youth and their rights to contest at the Local Authorities Elections as recognized and secured by section 28 (2)(B) of the present Act.
The petitioner said the bill paves way and vests with the secretaries of the contesting Political parties, absolute and unfettered right to act arbitrarily in nominating and qualifying members to the vacancies of the respective local authorities, by disregarding the order of priority previously specified and declared in the lists of candidates in the respective nomination papers. The petitioner maintained that, this clause undermines and infringes the sovereignty right of the people relating to franchise and freedom of thought and expression.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva with Kanishka Witharana appeared for the petitioners. Deputy Solicitor General Nerin Pulle with Dr. Awanthi Perera appeared for the Attorney General.

Theravada Bhikshu Kathikawatha Bill, a timely move - Asgiriya Prelate

Mahanayake of the Asgiriya Chapter Most. Ven Galagama Attadassi Thera yesterday said that the Theravada Bhikshu Kathikawatha Bill is a timely move and it is not aimed at imposing rules and regulations on the Maha Sangha, by the Government. The Mahanayake Thera said that the draft Bill is a result of repeated requests by the Maha Sangha led by the Mahanayake Theras of the three Chapters.
The Mahanayake Thera in a statement expressing his views with regard to the proposed Bill stressed that the government is only registering the Bhikkushu Kathikawatha compiled by respective Chapters and Parshavayas. However, The Mahanayake Thera said that a dispute has arisen over this Bill as some facts and characteristics that should be incorporated with the Bhikku Kathikawatha, have been included in the Draft Bill too. The Mahanayake Thera in his statement said that the Karaka Sangha Sabaha of the Asgiri Maha Viharaya will extensively study this proposed Bill and apprise its position to the government in the future.
