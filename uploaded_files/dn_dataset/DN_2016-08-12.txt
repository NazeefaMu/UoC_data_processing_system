Remembering Kandys  sporting greats

Now that the Rio Olympic Games is in progress it will be interesting to unearth some interesting facts about past heroes from Kandy. It was a Kandy school product who won the first Olympic medal. The unique feature is to recognize and appreciate Kandy's top sportsmen in boxing and athletics.
Duncan White won his Olympic medal the same year Ceylon gained independence from Britain in 1948. At the Wembley Olympic 400 metres hurdles, the most colourful of all track events, there was an obscure youth from a little known island. The loud-speakers blared their names: Two Americans confident of winning, a dour Swede, a swarthy Italian. Then the announcer said "Duncan White" of Ceylon. What notice did anyone take of the lanky youth in the sixth lane The pistol 'cracked' and the athletes went flat out like greyhounds. The blonde American sped strongly, the Swede also did same, and so did the man from "somewhere". At the penultimate hurdle his youth, build and self-confidence saw the American gaining.
But now Duncan White made his super effort, the moment he had been waiting for. Big of heart and with determination writ all over his face he flashed fast ahead of the Swede to take second place. Thus were Kandy and Ceylon engraved on the sports map of the world. In 1937, Trinity College perhaps the best schoolboy cricketing side of that year were at practice. One afternoon Duncan was training on the school grounds at Asgiriya for the AAA meet.
He was encroaching on to the lst XI cricket practising area at Asgiriya. White had a practice 100 yards sprint and it was something so magnificent that the whole cricket training squad stopped and watched and cheered the grand sprinter. Supple limbs and the fighting heart of a champion and perfect athlete. Like Johnny Weismuller or any succeeding Tarzan, Duncan, it appeared, was an irresponsible youngster.
There is the story that while waiting for an interview to join the Ceylon Police Force, Duncan found time hanging on his hands. A little later one of the selectors heard a complaint that some people from the police barracks had plucked young coconuts from an adjoining garden. The culprit was found to be White! He had seldom taken up to studies seriously. But when training for a meet all others were unimportant.
White trained with determination to win. At Trinity Duncan White won his 'Lion' in Athletics. He captained the athletic team. He was also a ruggerite of repute as rugby in the lives of all students at Trinity. He broke the Public Schools 220 yards record and won the 120 yards hurdles event and long jump. He also established a 440 yards record and was selected to participate at first Empire Games held in Australia in 1938. He was national champion for many years in the following events - 120 yards hurdles, 440 yards hurdles and 400 metres hurdles. He led the first Ceylon Olympic team to London in 1948 and won the Silver Medal in 400 meters hurdles, the first and only Ceylonese to win an Olympic Medal at that time.
He won the 440 yards hurdles at the first Indo-Ceylon contest, smashing the Indian record. He became the British and Irish Universities 440 yards hurdles champion and record holder while at Loughborough College, UK. He also captained the Ceylon team to Commonwealth Games in New Zealand and took the Gold Medal in 440 yards hurdles with a new record. Duncan White was awarded the MBE for his contribution to sports, the first sportsman in Ceylon to be thus honoured.
He was selected Sportsman of the Year by public polls. He obtained the Diploma in Physical Education of Loughborough College, UK in 1951 and was appointed Ceylon's National Athletics coach in 1958. He left Ceylon subsequently to take up an appointment as Director of Athletics at University of Ibadan, Nigeria.
Leslie Donovan Perera Handunge Lesley Handunge was the second son of Kandy to blaze the Olympic trail. He represented Ceylon at the 1948 Olympic Games and was the first Ceylonese to enter an Olympic ring and win an Olympic bout he led the Ceylon team to the 1952 Olympic Games. One time Director of Physical Education of the Peradeniya University, Handunge had his graduation at Trinity College in four major games - Cricket, Boxing, Rugger and Athletics. After leaving school, he played inter-club hockey, football and rugger for Kandy Sports Club and Kandy YMCA.
Late Handunge was a Diploma holder in Physical Education of Loughborough College, UK. He was the first Ceylonese to obtain this Diploma and obtained his Master's Degree in Physical Education from Springfield, USA. He had to work his way through at both these institutions. He won his first National title in 1944, the Flyweight category. He won the Best Boxer's Award at the Intermediate, Meet. Albert Perera Farewell Meet and National Championships. He represented the University of Ceylon at boxing and rugger and was the British and Irish University Bantamweight champion boxer while at Loughbrough College. Handunge was invited by the ABA of Ceylon to participate in the final boxing trial for the 1950 Empire Games, but was unable to leave for England. He retired as undefeated Flyweight Boxing Champion of Ceylon in 1952.
Sellapuliyage Lucien Benedict Rosa S.L.B ROSA - When he was picked for the Munich Olympics, he became the third son of Kandy to represent Ceylon. He was an athlete and was best in the 10,000 metres and the marathon. The big-hearted village boy from Ampitya had his education at St. Berreaweart's College.
When he participated in the Olympics the talk in Kandy was will he run barefooted or will he wear spikes Rosa's rise to fame has been meteoric. A product of one of the humbler Roman Catholic Schools in Kandy, it was only after joining the Army as a Sapper that he began to show up as an athlete. All the reputed long distance runners at the time were from Ampitiya, and for a time they were his seniors.
But serious training and dedication established him in good stead as our foremost long distance runner. He was born stricken by a dangerous virus ailments, but when parents and doctors pulled him through, he 'lost' his father, a railway worker when he (Rosa) was barely four years old. But the widowed mother took great pain to groom her son Rosa to become an athlete of great talent. Rosa was commonly seen running round the Kandy Lake. Then Tommy Arthur, Ampitiya's athletic coach took charge of Rosa for scheduled training.
Then enlisted him in the 1st Field Regiment, Ceylon Engineers of the Army. Col. P. D. Ramanayake, a great sports promoter and his Commanding Officer took him in hand. Rosa started winning almost all major awards at AAA and Service Meets. Later he left the Army for the Ceylon Transport Board which offered better employment prospects. He achieved his highest goal when he won the 5,000 and 10,000 metres at an Asian Games.
He established a new Asian Games record for the 10,000 metres with timing of 29 minutes - 55.6 seconds. He won the 5,000, meters with timing of 14 minutes. 32.2 seconds. His 10,000 meters timing was bettered by only five Olympic champions at that time.

Long Chen downs Karunaratne  in 40 minutes
RIO DE JANEIRO, Thursday- Sri Lankas Niluka Karunaratne lost his opening mens single group P match of the XXX1st Olympic Games badminton completion to Chinas Long Chen at Riocentro Pavilion Four here on Thursday. Chen took just 40 minutes to win in straight sets 2-0.
The match got off to a surprisingly delayed start, which is rare in Olympic completion, as the previous matches of the scheduled court had taken a longer duration. Karunaratne, Sri Lankas undisputed mens single champion on 14 occasions could not offer much in the first set as London Olympics bronze medallist Chen had an easy 21-7 victory in 19 minutes.
But Karunaratne fought back early in the second set and the scores were tied five-all at one stage.
But Chen, the two-time world champion who is among the top ranked badminton players in the world, used all his experience to cut loose and go past Karunaratne 21-10 in 21 at the end. It was a tough hurdle and I tried my best against a world class champion.
But I hope to do perform better in the next match, he told the media after the match.
Karunaratne will now meet Kevin Cordon of Guatemala in his second group P match to be worked off on Friday at 7.30 pm local time (4 am SL time on Saturday).
The Lankan national champions last group match will be against Adrian Dziolko of Poland, ranked 58th in the world. It will be played on Sunday at 3.55 pm local time (12.25 am SL time on Monday).
Defending mens singles badminton champion Lin Dan of China needed just 34 minutes to cleat his first hurdle today. He launched his triple Olympic crown campaign in style, crushing David Obernosterer of Austria in straight sets 21-5, 21-11 in their group E first round match.

NZ crashes out of rugby Sevens in Rio

RIO DE JANEIRO, THURSDAY: When it comes to rugby, few can match the achievements of New Zealand.
World champions in the 15-a-side format twice in succession, it was supposed to add the rugby sevens gold medal to its collection this time around.
The problem was that nobody told Fiji.
The Pacific Islanders, champions of the 2015-16 sevens series, claimed a 12-7 win on a wet and miserable day in Rio de Janeiro.
New Zealand, beaten by Japan and Great Britain in the group stage, has endured a dismal campaign.
It lost star player Sonny Bill Williams to a ruptured Achilles injury in the shock defeat by Japan and rarely looked like recovering.
And it was finally put out of its misery by Fiji, which scored tries through Osea Kolinisau and Jerry Tuwai.
Fiji will face Japan in the last four after it produced yet another shock victory, this time over France.
Japan left it late before claiming a 12-7 win to keep itself in with a chance of a medal.
In the days other quarterfinals Great Britain defeated Argentina 5-0 while South Africa overcame Australia 22-5.

Samarakoon gets  another chance  at a medal

RIO DE JANEIRO, THURSDAY: Sri Lankas ace shooter Mangala Samarakoon will be seen in action for the second time at the XXX1st Olympic Games when he takes part in the mens 50m rifle prone event qualification round at Olympic Shooting Range, commencing from 9 am on Friday (5.30 pm SL time).
The former South Asian Games gold medallist who came across an unexpected problem due to his shooting attire and painted a poor picture in the mens 10m air rifle event three days ago will not have the same worry in the prone event.
The problem with my shooting bottom, that does not support the grip after modification, does not arise here in the prone event. I will forget the bitter experience I had in the 10m air rifle event and take this as a new meet, a challenge, Samarakoon said on the eve of his second and last event.
Despite all those setbacks, I have been training hard and concentrating on my 50m prone event. I want to bounce back and fire a good score. I will try my best to achieve that, said Samarakoon who is competing in his second successive Olympic Games after London 2012. He completed his final work out today under the watchful eyes of his coach Pushpamali Ramanayake, the 1992 Barcelona Olympian and a gold medallist at the Commonwealth Games.
There will be a total of 47 shooters who will take part in the mens 50m rifle prone event and the Lankan lad has a personal best entry score of 1,941.

1st Royal London One-Day U19 series : Asalanka leads Sri Lanka  U-19 to easy victory

WORMSLEY: Englands Under-19s received another harsh lesson from Sri Lanka as they were beaten by 108 runs in the first match of the Royal London One-Day Series at Wormsley on Wednesday.
This was Englands first chance to bounce back from the defeat they suffered in the second four-day match against the Sri Lankans in Northampton last week, albeit with a slightly different team.
Instead they were dismissed for 149 after restricting the tourists to 257 for 7, losing their last eight wickets for 53 - seven of them shared by Sri Lankas three spinners.
Sri Lanka won the toss and chose to bat, but Bernard gave England the perfect start when he pegged back Dilan Jayalaths middle stump with the third ball of the match.
Green then broke a dangerous second wicket stand of 67 when he had Avishka Fernando well caught by a diving Ollie Pope. But Sri Lankas captain Charith Asalanka picked up where he had left off in Northampton, striking 70 from 96 balls with eight fours.
The tourists seemed on course for an imposing total but were pegged back in the middle of their innings by Bess, an offspinning allrounder from Devon who had already had Asalanka dropped at long on before taking a sharp return catch to dismiss the Sri Lankan captain himself.
England seemed to have restricted Sri Lanka to a manageable total.
England struggled to cope with the pressure exerted by Sri Lankas spinners and their excited chatter in the field. Pope ran himself out, Malik chipped a catch to mid-wicket after making 32 from 60 balls, and when Dell gave a return catch to Damitha Silva, England had lost four for 10 to slip to 106 for 6.
Green and Bess stemmed the flow slightly but Greens dismissal triggered another burst of four wickets in six overs, with Aaron Beard left unbeaten on 17 from 15 balls - the third highest score of the innings. Silva ended with 3 for 28 from his 10 overs, Hasaranga had 2 for 28 from eight, and Asalanka 2 for 27 from 6.3.
England must now win both the remaining matches to take the series, in Chelmsford on Saturday before a day-night match at the Spitfire Ground, St Lawrence next Tuesday.
Scores:
Sri Lanka U19 : 257-7 in 50 overs (Avishka Fernando 30, Charith Asalanka 70, Hasaranga de Silva 37, Shammu Ashan 60, Navindu Nirmal 21, H Bernard 2/43, B Green 2/46)
England U19 : 149 in 40.3 overs (M Holden 40, Zen Malik 32, Thilan Prasan 2/32, Charith Asalanka 2/27, Damitha Silva 3/28, Hasaranga de Silva 2/28)

Olympic bronze  medallist dropped  from Rio Games

Pradeep Sanjaya, bronze medalist at 2012 London Paralympic has been unfairly dropped from the Sri Lanka team for the Rio Paralympics.
Pradeep who won the 400m T-46 event clocking 49.28 sec. at the 2012 Paralympic games is understood to have been overlooked as a result of a personal dispute between his coach and an official of the Sri Lanka Disabled Athletic Sports Association.
Pradeep earlier served in the Sri Lanka Army and he was disabled following the war. He turned to sport and became the first Sri Lankan Paralympic medallist.
Pradeep was a member of the 4x100 metre relay event in Asia Oceania Disabled Athletic Meet held at UAE last year where Sri Lanka finished sixth in the world ranking.
He also won at the selection trials held at Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium, Diyagama last month.
Pradeeps coach has reported the matter to Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara and hopes justice will prevail.
The last date for team selections is August 14.

Was Galle pitch doctored by curators - The Australian

Photographs obtained by the The Australian of the wicket at Galle on the third day of the recent Test match show what are obvious efforts by curators to aid the local spinners writes Peter Lalor.
Despite the move apparently being in breach of ICC regulations, The Australian was informed last night that Sri Lanka Cricket had escaped sanction after ICC match referee Chris Broad filed his pitch report on Tuesday.
Pitch doctoring is one of the main reasons wins are becoming harder to gain on the subcontinent.
On the last day of the Test, which the Sri Lankans won in 2 days, Broad could be seen in animated conversation with the curator in the middle of the ground and appeared to be gesturing towards the areas in front of the crease.
Photographs obtained by The Australian show an area about two metres in front of the batting crease at either end that is prepared differently from the rest of the pitch, which has more grass on it and shows less general abrasion. The practice obviously aids local spin bowlers. Its understood the curator scraped up the grass in this patch to remove it entirely and the area might even have been brushed with a strong broom. The Australian team management refused to comment on the issue when contacted yesterday.
