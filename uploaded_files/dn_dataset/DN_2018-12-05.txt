SLPP calls for Parliamentary elections - MP Aluthgamage
Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (SLPP) MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage speaking to the media said that the only way out of this crisis is to go for a General Election so to allow the citizens of this country to decide on whom they chose to have as their leaders.
Speaking at the SLPP headquarters, he said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa cut short his term in office and called for snap elections because it is what people wanted at the time.
He left gracefully when the results were in. It demonstrates that he respects democracy and the will of the people of this country. Aluthgamage charged that the United National Party was shying away from calling for General Elections and wasting time dwelling on the crisis simply because they would not be able to garner the support they think they have.
It is evident that Ranil Wickremesinghe cannot win the next election. Neither can the JVP nor the TNA. There are reasons why the TNA backed by Sumanthiran and Sampathan is supporting the coalition, it is because they were promised federalism, he said. Now there are elements stirring up in the North and East.

Stingless bees create beautiful spiraling hives
Once again proving that nature is the best architect, were in awe of the spiraling hives built by Sugarbag bees (Tragonula carbonaria). Native to Australia, they not only build an innovative hive, but theyre also rather kind - they dont sting.
Sugarbag bees are one of 21 genera of stingless bees, 14 of which call Australia their home. These medium-sized bees are strong fliers that can travel up to 1 km (0.62 miles), though they prefer to stay close to home if given the choice. Busy year-round, the colony creates magnificent spiraling structures that look more like a Zaha Hadid building than a regular beehive.
Dr. Tim Heard, an entomologist who has been keeping stingless bees since 1985 and wrote the Australian Native Bee Book, calls them highly social insects.
Its unclear exactly why they build their hives in such a unique form. The entrance and surroundings are covered with a thick layer of cerumen - a mix of beeswax and propolis - and each cell is sealed to keep out microbes. Interestingly, most stingless bees are also monogamous, meaning a colony thats been divided may actually live on without a queen.
You might ask yourself how these bees mount a defense if they dont sting. First, each hive only has one entrance, giving enemies fewer ways to get inside. And even though they dont sting, they do bite. Lastly, they rely on numbers.
When an intruder is suspected, theyll sometimes form a giant cloud of thousands of worker bees known as a fighting swarm.
They then swoop down on the enemy, wrestling it to the ground and often killing it. Unfortunately, this often means death for the bees themselves, a true act of altruism for the safety of the colony. My Modern Met

Determined to climb the leader-board, the Sri Lankan Lions then took to the field and out classed the South African Rhinos with exceptional bowling and fielding.

Themes and experimentations of Tamil short stories (1962-1998)
There are more than 500 short story writers in Lanka. They are from all parts of the country. Most of them are Tamils and Muslims. I can only speak about the anthologies I was able to read. Some of the writers are no more living. Some of their collection of short stories are also not available. I wonder whether they are available in the libraries too.
I started reading their collections only from 1962. Up till 1998 I have read only 72 of them. I wrote reviews analyzing each of the stories in the collections I read. I wrote my impressions both in Tamil and English. Here I am speaking only about what I wrote in Tamil. May I say I was the pioneer in analyzing each of the story, whereas such literary criticism did not evolve in Tamil in Lanka.
Tamil short story
Even after 1998, I continued to analyze Lankan Tamil short story collections I was able to read. I hope to bring them in a further collection.
Meanwhile, recently Jeevanathi Publications printed my reviews of Lankan short story collections I read between 1962 and 1998. In Thamil, its called Eelathuch Chiru Kathaikalum Aasiriyarkalum: Oru Pan Mukap Paarvai in August this year. What it means in English is: Lankan Short Stories and Writers: a Multidisciplinary Approach.
The critical notes son the stories and the writers in the book serve resourceful for academics and critics of 21st century men and women.
Only when we know about the earlier pattern of short story writing can we then evaluate the contemporary short story writing in Lanka in Tamil language.
The pioneer Tamil short story writers in Lanka were Ilankayarkone, Vaithilingam and Sambanthan. They wrote their stores on romantic, mythical, religious and historical l themes and got their stories published I magazines in South India. Although they had their footing in Lanka, they wrote their stories having the Tamil Nadu readers in mind and adapted the style and language of such readers. Later on, their locales especially with Ilangayarkone.
Tamil Nadu style
While writer in the North tried to base their stories in local realistic situations, in the East, they blindly followed the Tamil Nadu style. For a long time, the Sinhalese and Tamils thought that Lankan writing was only an extension of Tamil Nadu writing.
In the late 1950, when K Kailasapathy took over the editorship of the Thinakaran daily and weekly, he gave importance to new Lankan Tamil writers who wrote realistic stories based on Lankan life. A crop of new writers came up showing their individuality with a Lankan identity.
So, the idea of Lankan Consciousness had its nucleus there.
Now, in Tamil Literature, different kinds of writing are produced in various parts of India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, Canada, Australia, and European countries including the U K.
Imbibed by Marxism and as a fashion, most under privileged writers in the North wrote on poor Vs rich trade union activities, caste problems, temple entry, dowry problems and the like.
The Hill country winters wrote on the plight of the plantation workers, and how they were exploited by the estate owners and the Kangaanis.
In the East, there was a beginning to write realistic stories.
After 1983, the plight of the Tamil-speaking people, on account of the 30-year war was the main theme.
Colombo experiences
Some writers wrote on alienation and psychological themes as well.
Towards the 1990s, variety of themes and experimentation in form began to evolve among the writers from various parts of the country. Some wrote on their experiences Colombo life.
As I said earlier, the book concerned covers only the period 1962- 1998.
The significance of the book lies on its serving as a resource document for future analysts to write the history of Tamil short story writing in Lanka.

First ever Sri Lanka Army Womens Corps symposium:
Timely venture to further empower women - Army Commander
The Sri Lanka Army Womens Corps (SLAWC) first ever symposium on the theme Women: the Bedrock of Peace and Sustainable Development took place at the BMICH yesterday, with President Maithripala Sirisena gracing the occasion as the Chief Guest.
With the majority of the countrys population consisting of women, it is inevitable that women take the lead in all forms of development in the future.
This Symposium served as a platform for learning and interacting as womens participation in leading decision-making roles since they are also still under represented in our society.
The first ever Symposium of this nature organized by the SLAWC was held under various appropriate topics.
The symposium focused mainly on womens contribution to society not just as caregivers in the family, but also womens participation in todays society in the role of contributors to the familys economy and as decision makers at national and international level.
The seminar was held under four main tops and six sub-topics mainly on the role of women of the armed forces promoting ethnic harmony and peace keeping, nation building through women empowerment, the emerging role of women as a catalyst of development and sustainable peace, impact of women participation in decision making for sustainable peace etc.
Addressing the gathering, the Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake said present day women have surpassed the traditional roles given by the patriarchy society and embarked on the social, economic and political fields to provide active support and contribution to the family first, to the workplace next and the community at large in a broader sphere.
Women, globally and locally have risen to greatness and power by entering into the different spheres like nursing, teaching, management, police, defence, sports, space exploration, social work and many other fields and increasing their influence in the decision-making process.
In such a context, he said as the Army Commander, he believes that initiating Sri Lanka Army Womens Symposium is a timely venture to further empower women with a vision.
The Symposium is aimed at bringing women leaders into the conversation and creating an engaged platform with women to highlight the role of women in achieving sustainable peace and development.
In Sri Lanka, women are still under-represented in managerial, decision making and leadership positions though there is significant presence of women in the peace building and reconciliation agenda.
Women in the peace building process need to be further empowered to enhance their representation at various levels of decision making, activism and advocacy.
The Sri Lanka Army paved the way for generations of young women to serve the motherland by founding the Sri Lanka Army Womens Corps in the year 1979 with its motto Powerful Mind is the Strongest Weapon, he added.

Trump salutes Bush at U.S. Capitol
US: US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania paid their respects Monday to late President George H.W. Bush, whose remains lay in state in the US Capitol.
The Trumps made a brief visit to the Capitol rotunda, where Bushs flag-draped coffin was resting as part of tributes to honour the 41st US President and commemorate his extraordinary life.
Bush died peacefully Friday at age 94, at his home in Houston, a passing that led Americans to reflect on his life of duty and service to country as a leader of the so-called Greatest Generation. Only the second President to see his son follow him to the Oval Office, the Republican stalwart is being honoured with four days of commemorations and services in Washington and in Texas, where he will be buried Thursday.
Trump is scheduled to attend a state funeral service Wednesday at the Washington National Cathedral -- the first Presidential funeral since Gerald Ford died in 2006.
President Trump was driven from the White House up to Capitol Hill on Monday.
With the First Lady at his side, Trump saluted, and they stood at Bushs casket for about a minute.
Bush never warmed to Trump, and he had let it be known that he did not vote for him in 2016. Trump himself has criticized the elder Bush on the campaign trail.
But on Monday, Trump wrote members of Congress to hail Bush as a man who led a life that exemplified what is truly great about America. President Bush worked selflessly throughout his long life to bring about a world of justice and lasting peace, he wrote.
Bush was a decorated World War II fighter pilot, onetime ambassador to China, former head of the Central Intelligence Agency, and vice president to Ronald Reagan before winning the White House.
Military pallbearers carried the flag-draped casket into the rotunda as a fiery sunset bathed Washington in a glow.
The somber ceremony was attended by his son George W. Bush -- the nations 43rd President -- and other relatives, dignitaries and more than 100 members of the House and Senate.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell lauded Bush -- who occupied the White House from 1989 to 1993 -- as a patriot who steered the country as straight as he had piloted his World War II airplane. Bush is the 12th US President to lie in state in the rotunda. Just three months earlier, the honour was accorded to senator John McCain, a former Republican presidential nominee who died of brain cancer.
Hundreds of members of the public began quietly filing in to the Capitol late Monday to pay their final respects. Bush will be honored at a state funeral service at the cathedral on Wednesday, which Trump has declared a national day of mourning.
Bill Clinton will be among the living US Presidents to attend, along with dozens of foreign leaders including Germanys Angela Merkel.
Former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney said he would deliver one of several eulogies, at Bushs request.
On Thursday, Bush will be interred at the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library Center in College Station, Texas, next to his wife Barbara, who died in April, and their daughter Robin who died of leukemia at age three. House Speaker Paul Ryan alluded to that political setback in his Capitol remarks and said Bush handled defeat with grace.
He was the first President to teach me that in a democracy sometimes you fall short -- and that how you handle that is just as important as how you win, Ryan said. - AFP

Unputdownable and absorbing
Title: The Beggar Maid
Author: Dilly Court
Dreams in life could be a driving force in life and when they are genuine. The Beggar Maid by the world famous author Dilly Court reminds us the validity of this assumption at the end of her novel in no uncertain terms. It has gone to the rare list of The Sunday Times top ten best seller list because of its writing style, plot development, themes, setting and above all superb characterization. The novel is veritably unputdownable and absorbing. The authoress could proudly boast of over eighteen successful novels under her belt.
The protagonist Charity had been a beggar girl on the London streets since she unceremoniously passed her eighth birthday. She plays the role of an orphan looking after her grandfather under trying conditions and caring and sharing the grief of her aged grandfather is thought provoking. The best part of the plot begins with the death of her grandfather and she is fueled by endurance and patience. In the wake of his demise, she meets a bookseller named Jethro Darkins. She becomes his helper and the housekeeper and he does not treat her well.
Everlasting value
Yet, her endurance and plight keep her glued to him as she does not have any alternative. Jethro leaves an everlasting value in her life and it is love for books. Her eagerness to come out of this ordeal gives her vigour. Every cloud has a silver lining and Charity becomes the owner of the book shop after her masters death according to his will. In the meanwhile the writer creates another intricate plot situation to evict her from the property. The rent of the property is raised making the situation unbearable to Charity. She had to return to the street. Charity, her name-not to be bemused by the word meaning, meets a genuine gentleman, a doctor by profession, and her life changes. His meeting paves the path for an experience filled life. Eventually she is destined to be the wife of a young man who inherits a treasure land in which Charity plays a very instrumental role to uplift the property to a money making endeavor.
Violet, another destitute girl in the family way plays the role of the accomplice in this events filled plot. Dorrie is another lively character who gives life to the plot that could keep the reader in in spirit. A lot of other characters are interestingly arrayed to tell her story to the readers everywhere. Suspense from chapter to chapter makes the fiction unputdownable.
Easier to grasp
A close perusal of the story convinces that Dilly Court has been influenced by Enid Blyton. So, those who have read Enid Blyton may find the plot line easier to grasp. The writer has very much used the language paying attention to the character dispositions. It reminds us the diction used by Charles Dickens to build the characters of Magwich and others from the lower strata of the society. Dickensian Style makes the reader glued to the plot line and the social order of the unprivileged lot of the society.
The story offers a great opportunity to the young reader to expand their vocabulary to a great extent. It is also a crevice to peep into both the lowest social order of the London society and the land owning privileged class. I do not have the slightest hesitation to recommend The Beggar Maid by Dilly Court to the enthusiastic readers of the thrilling genre of fiction because of the very fact that it is penned by a veteran fiction writer in the tapestry of modern novel.

Wayamba to develop tourism
The newly appointed Chairman of the Wayamba Development Authority (WDA), former PC member Nilantha Supun Rajapaksa told the Daily News yesterday that Kalpitiya will be developed as a tourist destination.
He said Wayamba is still at a basic level and much more has to be done to improve the tourism industry.
Tourist information centres would be set up in Kurunegala, Badagamuwa and Yapahuwa.
Wayamba has archaeological sites, colonial monuments, bird and wildlife sanctuaries and such areas should be developed as tourist hotspots, he said.
Rajapaksa said the main target of the Wayamba Development Authority is to attract foreign as well as local tourists and boost hotel accommodation.

We will not allow foreign interference - Voice for Justice
Voice for Justice Editor Sudarman Radaliyagoda said yesterday that the names of those who received monthly allowances and vehicles from the Road Development Authority will be reveled next week, just as the names of those who allegedly received funds and vehicles from Litro gas were revealed this week.
We will reveal all the frauds and corruption that had taken place at state organisations during the last three and half years shortly, he added.
He said it is only when MP Mahinda Rajapaksa wanted to bring down gas prices, that we came to know about persons who apparently worked to bring about a just society had also allegedly received payments from Litro gas.
That is the reason why we could not reduce the gas prices for the last three and half years, he added.
The UNP which always cries for democracy is now trying to forcibly enter state institutions. We vehemently condemn the attempts by two UNP MPs to forcibly enter the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation and trying to sabotage its work, Radaliyagoda said. Certain local and foreign elements are trying to take the country back to a civil war situation but the people will not allow that to happen, he said.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, Radaliyagoda said both Rupavahini and ITN have come down in the ratings after 2015 mainly because of a number of frauds and corruption.
Several advisors appointed to the ITN have received nearly Rs.200,000 of monthly payments even without coming to work, he said.

Why crows know a lot more than you and I
Title: Kakiyan: The Story of a Crow
Author: Elmo Jayewardene
Most people, asked to consider crows and their usefulness, if any, in our public life, would call them scavengers. I suppose that I might have done the same today, if I had not been invited by Elmo Jayewardene to edit his new novel for publication. Having completed that task and handed his manuscript back to its author, I can honestly say that I shall never again be able to see a crow or hear its kaw! without feelings of affection and deep respect.
Kakiyan must be one of the most endearing birds that ever entered the field of literature. He is certainly not the most beautiful. The crown of physical beauty has long been in the possession of the Peacock and the Ceylon Grackle, the second of whom scholars of Sinhala know as the Selalihini, the bird that Venerable Totagamuwe Sri Rahula Thera, a scholar monk of the 15th century, chose to carry his poetic message, the Selalihini Sandesa. Dont fly too high, the poet warned his messenger in a famous passage, or one of those sky-goddesses who frequent the clouds might see your sleek black feathers and golden wattles, and, mistaking you for a jewel or a flower, pluck you out of the sky and place you in her hair as an ornament.
No such praise can ever come Kakiyans way. His plain black coat prevents that, and he knows it. Nor does he have the sweetest voice in the avian world: that prize has long been shared by two birds associated with English literature, Shelleys Skylark and Keatss Nightingale. The admirable thing about Jayewardenes Sri Lankan hero  among his many other virtues, which include loyalty and a compassionate heart<U+0336>is that he is totally lacking in envy and has no desire to borrow other birds feathers to enhance his own reputation. Dont mistake me for any high-flying Seagull, please! he tells his reader. My name is not Jonathan Livingston, it is Kakiyan the Crow, son of Stanley and Alice Crow, and brother of Rodney and Lucille. A glance at an encyclopaedia will inform the reader that Sri Lankas Kakiyan is a scion of the ancient Corvidae family, with an ancestry that goes back to the Raven that flew from Noahs Ark in the time of the Great Flood, and has spread internationally  indeed, as far as the United States, where another raven inspired one of the best-known poems of Edgar Allan Poe. But you will never hear this from the author himself, for Kakiyan is a modest bird that plumes himself on nothing but his rare ability to tell an enthralling story and, at the same time, celebrate the wisdom of his community.
In reading the autobiography of this remarkable author, the reader gains a birds eye view of the human condition, for Kakiyans adventures have led him into law courts, football fields and many other places where people foregather, usually oblivious of the fact that a beady eye is trained upon their activities. His insights are valuable, his judgments reliable: he is not just a crow, he is a just crow. We have a lot to learn about our own world from Kakiyan, from his mother, the matriarch Alice Crow, from old Roy Crow, the optimist who unfailingly finds the silver linings in every cloud, from his philosophical brother-in-law, the meditative Cameron (Cato) Crow, and from all the other characters who fly in and out of his pages.
Towards the end of this remarkable tour de force, this Kaputu Kathawa of a twenty-first-century crow, Kakiyan speculates about the afterlife: where will his last flight take him As his admiring and grateful editor, I would say that he need have no worries about that. Cool, calm and confident, Jayewardenes hero undeterred, will join the shining ranks of Heavens literary birds.

## Title: Why is it so hard to quit Amazon

Why is it so hard to quit Amazon
There are more than 100 million paid subscriptions to Amazon Prime, the inordinately convenient service that provides fast shipping, good deals, and prestige television to consumers. The majority of U.S. households (51 percent) have an account. Increasingly, people are wising up to both the companys serious threat as a monopoly and its willingness to seek domination at the expense of the health of its blue-collar workers. Citing these atrocities, some people have vocally canceled their accounts and encouraged others to do the same.
A rising number of people willing to revolt against Amazon is a good thingconsumers using their collective power to show that they care about labor and market consolidation is a compelling way to agitate for change. But its also worth thinking about why canceling an Amazon subscription might be hard, if not impossible, for many people. Its simply not a step that everyone can take, and thats not just because people are unwilling to forgo convenience.
Its easy to forget, because everyone has to do it and its often pleasurable, but shopping is labor. In a country with lacking social services for parents, and a pay structure that undervalues certain kinds of labor, Prime has stepped in to fill a gap. For parents, creatives, teachers stretching to make ends meet, or disabled or elderly folks who have trouble leaving the house, it can serve as a Band-Aid, helping them save money and time.
In a country with lacking social services for parents, and a pay structure that undervalues certain kinds of labor, Prime has stepped in to fill a gap.
I talked to a number of a people who are Prime users and feel unable to cancel their accounts. The most consistent theme was that Amazon saved them time and money that they couldnt spare. Kevin Davies, who lives in New Jersey, says he and his wife find Prime useful in part because the service sends giant boxes of diapers to their second-floor condo unit at a 20 percent discount. We are working parents (fortunately I work from home, so theres no day care cost) trying to pay our bills and sock a little away for emergencies and retirement (and now college), Davies explained in an email, enumerating the long list of ways that Prime helps his family save money.
He questions whether skipping Prime and bringing his business elsewhere would be helpful in the bigger picture. He was an assistant manager of a Walmart for two years, and they treat everyone like garbage, he said.
Shannon, a mom of two who lives in the Northeast, felt similarly. We considered canceling our subscription; however, with a baby due in January and a 5- and 3-year-old at home I just cannot part with the convenience. Convenience in the dead of winter, I may add. Shes a homemaker, and her husband travels a lot for work.
A librarian in Miami named Nneka noted that Saving money is really critical, in a DM on Twitter. Amazon helps with that. Also allows me to treat myself.
NYC-based DJ Erzen Krivca also noted needing to pinch pennies: I saw a celebrity on Twitter say if you live in NYC you can go across the street and get your own toilet paper. Thats true BUT I also have to [pay] an exorbitant amount for rent!!, he wrote in an email.
Small-business owners rely on Prime to make ends meet, too. Do I want to get on the road and ride bumper to bumper to get to the store for a few items, such as stationery and a couple of boxes of Lipton tea a director of marketing at a small PR firm told CNBC. I find that I have less stress throughout the day, thanks to shopping online. This description speaks to the reality that shopping is labor, and doing it eats up time and money that could be spent elsewhere. Via Prime, Amazon has decided to foot the bill of a cost that we dont think of until suddenly it has evaporated from our lives. And once youve gotten used to it, its a hard deal to undo.
Of course, Prime is ultimately a terrible way to help struggling people struggle lessit saves people a small amount of time and money  at the expense of other people. What we need, change-wise, is policy actions that both take on Amazon and support the people who currently rely on it.
This reality might help explain why I havent been able to decide what to do with my own Amazon account. With so many subscriptions, canceling mine feels akin to recycling to save the planetlarger action is much more critical to change than making sure a handful of plastic bottles dont end up in a landfill. - Slate

Took correct decision on October 26
Will resolve political  instability within a week
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday, assured the nation that the current political instability will be resolved in a week.
The President said his decision to appoint former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister was a right decision taken by him for the sake of the country and its posterity.
Making a special statement yesterday at the Sri Lanka Freedom Partys special convention held at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium, he said he will not appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister even if he brought letters signed by all the 225 members of the Legislature.
I have no personal issues with him, but he is a politician who does not suit the country. His vision and the way of thinking does not suit this country, the President said.
The President added that Wickremesinghe lacked a sense of patriotism, national identity and respect for cultural values and ethos.
The people in the North have been taken for a ride by Wickremesinghe. He hesitates to solve issues of the people in the Northern province, he said. He added that his decision on Octomber 26 to sack Wickremesinghe is correct.
The President added that he issued five Gazzette notifications using executive powers. These gazettes were signed using my powers with an intention of building a new society free from corruption and fraud, he said.
This political crisis may sometimes be a novel experience to our country after 1948 but it is no longer a novel phenomenon for the rest of the countries in the world, he said
The President said that many countries where democracy reigns, witnessed this type of crisis. Germany did not have a government for over six months as Chancellor Angela Merkel did not have required majority, he saidHe added that Italy did not have a government for over five weeks after a General Election . Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was removed all of a sudden, he said.
The President also condemned clashes that took place in Parliament.He said issued should be addressed not physically but ideologically.
The President said similar clashes in parliaments are reported from many countries and it is not a new phenomenon.
The President added that the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal did not issue their final determination over a number of petitions against his decisions. The court issued interim orders and a number of petitions are to be taken up. They are not murder cases. They are not rape cases. They are political cases.
The President added that the people in the country have difference of opinions over these political cases. I always have respect towards the judiciary and I will accept the decisions taken by the court always,he said.
He said the people in the country had different opinions over the judiciary in the country.One group of people say that the judiciary is very impartial and independent.Another group of people say it is not so. There are difference of opinions among various groups of people,he said.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party has the strength to defeat extreme right wing policies of UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as the SLFP has always represented the common masses.
He said that former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe murdered the good governance concept and that he stood by patiently for over three years.
The President added that Cabinet colleagues and the government group are well aware of this situation.
He said that there is no dispute in the country but there is a political crisis which has resulted in this tense situation.

Convent of Our Lady of Victories, Moratuwa
The world beyond the portals
Head Prefect of Convent of Our Lady of Victories, Moratuwa Dianne Fernando is filled by the spirit and empowered by the Spirit. Perfect Prefects features Fernando a leader of deep conviction and piety.
Fernando is devoutly religious and does not hesitate to say that God and Mother Mary are her role models in life. Mary, the virgin is known as a holy woman who conceived Jesus through the Holy Spirit. For Fernando, god is her everything and asserted that Mary led a perfect life.
Strong belief
I love my God and he is always listening. Prayer life is so important to me. My religion is a special part of my life. I believe for there to be justice people need to speak out and I want to do this by being a lawyer. I feel that in this world children are precious and abortion is unethical. I also want to open an orphanage one day for those children who dont have parental care. I want to help them build their lives and also their spiritual life. I think they also need to build up their personality which can be helpful, explained Fernando.
She pointed out one factor behind most of the problems in society is that the victim or even the perpetrators have not received love in their life. She stressed the importance to help others because Death is not the end. There is a heaven. Fernando also stressed that at all times do meritorious deeds, be kind to others and have compassion. Sometimes people may not ask for our help even though they need it. They do not show it.
She also noted that there are many prostitutes in Colombo and that she is chagrined by the fact that very little is done about this. She also noted that poverty is the problem here because these women need to support themselves and maybe their children. Fernando wants to help them as well because she believes in spirituality which is important.
Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many - Matthew 20:28
Working on solutions
I want to be of service to others and work for those who have been neglected by society. We need to work together to find solutions to problems and I would like to help to improve the lives of all citizens. The problem is that most people have their own agendas. Good people need to come forward. My main ambition is to serve others. I am very concerned about human rights and I would like to ask why Why is their war and why do people need to kill each other Is it correct pointed out Fernando.
Fernando points out that one crucial aspect of education is the ability to perform. One is required to perform in the classroom and at exams. One is required to perform in the arena of sports. One is required to joins clubs. And one is required to perform in the biggest arena of them all  the world beyond the portals of ones school.
I feel a proper education allows the child to interact with others. One needs to be able to get along with others. One needs to be able to cultivate fruitful and positive relationships with others. This is also a branch of knowledge and experience that will help you in life. This will help you grow in confidence, even aid you in public speaking and present yourself before others, said Fernando.
Obscure paths
Fernando commented that when you are young, your plans may keep on changing. When you are young your path in life may be a little obscure. That is normal. Even many young adults still have no idea as to where their destiny lies. But with the passing of time, one arrives at an understanding of what to do.
Fernando initially was overwhelmed when she was told that she would be appointed Head Prefect. It was such a huge appointment with so much responsibility. The first thing she did was pray and through prayer, she was made to believe that becoming Head Girl was what God wanted from her. She was made to believe that it would be a positive influence on her and that she would receive something special.
Fernando pointed out that it is particularly saddening, the choices people make in their lives. You need to understand that there are consequences to your behaviour. In certain cases, a child is conceived in a moment of passion which may lead to abortion. This is the fault of the parents. Even when it comes to prostitution, education can help these women to be independent and have a better life by earning money.
Unused talent
This is why education in life is so important. My school is an old one that offers an excellent education to many young girls. My school is very concerned about the spiritual life of the girls. It focuses a lot on spirituality. The sisters are always there for us to guide us along the correct path. Our teachers are very learned and show us a lot of consideration. They also teach us how to form relationships with others because this world that we live in is very corrupted. They give us the necessary protection we need. I am so proud to be a part of this school. You are a unique human being. And I believe anyone can have a special vision. We also have a special subject at school that teaches us about issues in life. Our school provides us with this facility. This facility needs to be available in all schools in Sri Lanka, said Fernando.
Fernando pointed out that there is a beautiful quotation in a book she read - The world is full of unused talents and latent abilities. The reason these talents lie buried is that the individual hasnt the courage to dig them up and use them.
Dig yourselves and pave your path for success. If we commit ourselves and have an ambition or vision, we can totally change this world. So as the future generation I invite all of you to stand up, to fight for your dreams and to embrace them. Mother Teresa too is an individual who led an exemplary life. Knowing your rights are important because your rights are so precious, said Fernando.
Her message to young people is a powerful one. She says that one should not be afraid to take up the mantle of prefect-ship. She points out that becoming a prefect is something that is valuable. It is a good thing. She invites all her sisters and brothers to take up the challenge. Your advanced levels and ordinary levels are also important, so study diligently.
She is a chorister, writer and also a poet and plays the Piano. She also likes to one day publish her poems and her short stories.

Akshata distributes low-GI, non-GMO paddy seeds
Akshata, in its drive to increase Low-GI Rice varieties that are high in antioxidants with medical properties expanded its farmer base by eight fold, distributing 10,000 kg of paddy seed free of charge and benefitting 200 new farmers.
The project would enable these farmers to earn three times the revenue they would have otherwise earned by harvesting chemically dependent Hybrid varieties of rice. The new Clusters of farmers will grow Akshata Non-GMO Rice varieties strictly chemical-free. It would allow farmers to earn much higher revenue per acre as a result of the exclusivity of the rice and its niche health-conscious consumer base.
Roshan Perera, entrepreneur, social activist and Managing Director of Grains and Green states, People across the world are becoming more and more conscious about what they eat, we see great opportunity because, we as a company internalized Purity as a core value from its inception and our foray into Organic Foods for both local and international markets. He adds, We are constantly evolving and changing the portfolio of Akshata to offer the best to the ever changing preferences of the consumers. Grains n Green today is in the transition stage of being a rice company to a healthy food company. More than ever the consumer today knows the importance of healthy foods and makes a very conscious and informed choice of healthy foods.
Rice is a major food staple of Sri Lanka, but the countrys self-sufficiency in the crop is low, and increasing rice production is a priority. In order to do so, high-quality seeds of superior rice varieties must be produced in higher volumes and distributed more widely in major rice-growing areas. Grains n Green has provided cooperation by re-introducing exclusive rice varieties consumed by ancient Sri Lankan Kings that have been preserved for over a thousand years, and making it available for all health-conscious consumers with its extended production techniques for these varieties.
Farmers face many challenges with the lack of proper machinery, flooding and proper drainage facilities. Given these circumstances, there is a need to provide opportunities and create a system for more suitable rice-paddy cultivation to enhance the productivity of high-quality rice seeds.
This project aims to improve the access to expertise and advisory services for rice farmers, and improve the unit crop from rice paddy transplant production by 20 percent, specifically concentrating on increasing the production of exclusive traditional rice in Sri Lanka.

Twenty-one ambulances have been deployed in the Central Province under the Suwaseriya project, the first pre-hospital care ambulance service in Sri Lanka. Nine ambulances were deployed in the Kandy district, eight in the Nuwara-Eliya district and four in the Matale district.
The new ambulances have been deployed covering the rough mountain landscapes in some parts of the Central Province.
The service is to be expanded to the Sabaragamuwa Province and then to the Eastern Province before long, the Suwaseriya Foundation told the Daily News.
The Suwaseriya service was made available in the Northern Province in July, Uva Province in August, North Central Province in September and Northwestern Province in October. The Suwaseriya Foundation was set up by way of a Parliamentary Act with the aim to expand it to cover the entire country.
This emergency ambulance service, which is provided free, was initiated in 2016 in the Western and Southern Provinces under an Indian grant of US$ 7.5 million. The grant included the purchase of 88 ambulances, operational expenditure of the service for one year, and setting up of an emergency response centre.
The emergency ambulance service, which can be obtained by dialling the toll free number 1990 on any network in Sri Lanka, is one of the largest Indian grant projects in Sri Lanka.

## Title: Assessing Economic Development

Assessing Economic Development
The first article (on November 28, 2018) in this series on macroeconomic indicators to assess economic development covered aggregate production and income or real sector indicators. All economic activities are contributed by the labour market that supplies various types of labour. No production activity can take place without labour. Therefore, almost all macroeconomic theories present views on how the momentum of economic activities interact with the labour market and the level of employment. Also, almost all economic policies target creation of more employment opportunities including new entrepreneurs.
The population becomes a burden to a country if the economy is unable to create employment opportunities to all working age population or labour force. Countries with low income and poor standards of living are the countries whose economy is unable to provide better employment opportunities. The objective of all state policies to attract foreign investment is to create more and better employment opportunities. Once the production structure is able to mobilize resources including labour, people will find employment opportunities suitable to their skills. Therefore, rather than granting living subsidies to unemployed or low-income segments at cost to income earners, pro-capitalist countries prefer policies to encourage investments, skill development, entrepreneurship and better business environment that create more employment opportunities through innovations, increased productivity and mobilization of untapped resources.
In general, growth of the economy or production should raise the level of employment over the period. The negative economic growth accompanies reduction in employment or increase in unemployment. The business cycles, i.e., ups and downs in economic growth, are considered unfavourable as they are directly associated with cycles of employment which are not healthy for people. The living standards become better if all in the labour force are able to find better employment.
The labour force participation rate, unemployment rate and wages are the key macroeconomic indicators relating to the labour market in the economy. In Sri Lanka, Quarterly Labour Force Survey of the Department of Census and Statistics (conducted since 1990) is the source of information on labour force and unemployment. The Labour Department and Central Bank provide some statistics on wage movements. As the major source of labour market information is the country-wide surveys conducted periodically, the aggregate information over a long period should be used cautiously due to controversial changes in definitions and lapses in data collection.
Labour Force
The labour force is the percentage of economically active people in the working age population. Working age population consists of persons who are aged 15 years and above. In surveys before 2012, 10 years was the age limit. Persons who are working and willing to work for income/economic gain are the labour force. Employees working for wage income are only one category of labour. Entrepreneurs and capital owners also are important part of labour. Full-time students, old aged persons, physically disabled persons and persons who are not interested in working due to various personal reasons are the persons not in the labour. They are the dependents.
Therefore, the labour force is the human resource base which manages the economy. In Sri Lanka, labour force has increased to 54.1% of working age population by 2017. The female labour force rate is about a half of it for male. However, both rates have increased in the past. Expansion of education and economic activities generally contribute to higher labour force, especially for females.
Unemployment
The labour force consists of employed and unemployed. Employed persons are those who work for income/earnings. Paid employees, employers/entrepreneurs, own account workers/self-employees and family members contributing to family work for gain are the employed. Persons who worked at least one hour and persons who have a job but did not work during the reference period of the survey are considered as employed. The reference period is the four weeks prior to the date of the survey of the household.
* Definition of Unemployed
Persons who did not work at least one hour during the past month but were available and looking for work during the month and are ready to accept a job within next two weeks, if the opportunity is given, are the unemployed. The percentage of unemployed persons in the labor force is the unemployment rate which is the most important economic indicator that represents the labour market conditions in response to economic activities. Economic growth and buoyancy are expected to reduce the unemployment rate and vise-versa.
* Level and Trend of Unemployment
Economic recessions are primarily reflected by rising unemployment rate to very high levels. For example, unemployment rates in the countries hit by the global financial crisis 2008/09 rose to 10%-25% in Europe and the US. Historically high unemployment also was reported during the Great Depression in 1930s, for example 14%-25% in the US. However, unemployment rate in the US has now declined to thirty-year low of 3.7% in October 2018.
A considerable decline in unemployment in Sri Lanka is shown from data although data are not strictly comparable due to differences in definitions and coverage of households. In general, unemployment rate has declined from around 10%-15% in 1970s-1990s to about 4%-5% in 2010s.
Relatively higher level of unemployment among the youth (18.6% among the aged 15-24) and educated persons (8.1% among GCE A/L and above) is reflective of the education system not being able to produce immediately employable persons to cater to new needs of the economy. Female unemployment (6.5%) being twice the male unemployment is reflective of relatively less employment opportunities for female.
* Underemployment
The relaxed/broad definition of employed as working at least one-hour for income/gain during the past month has a bias towards a lower unemployment rate. Therefore, highly underemployed persons also fall under the employed. The underemployment is a concept to identify those who do not have jobs for normal hours of work. In Sri Lanka, those who work less than 35 hours a week are considered as underemployed persons.
The underemployment rate stood at 2.8% of labour force in 2017. If the underemployed are considered as almost unemployed because they do not find regular jobs, the unemployment rate will increase to about 8%. While underemployment rate for female rose from 3.4% to 3.9% between 2004 and 2017, it for male fell from 2.7% to 2.4%.
* Natural Rate of Unemployment
It is natural to have a certain rate of unemployment in any economy even at the full employment. This rate reflects unemployment resulting from delays involved in transfer between jobs and filling job vacancies as well as unemployment created by wage and labour regulations such as minimum wages. Firms will reduce hiring when the minimum wage is higher than profitable. This natural rate of unemployment will vary across countries depending on differences in labour market structure and rigidities. In the US, the present estimate for the natural unemployment rate is around 4%. Authorities or economists in Sri Lanka do not estimate such a natural rate of unemployment.
Wages
Wages are the prices for labour of paid employees determined by demand for and supply of labour in respect of various labour categories/skills. Accordingly, wage rates vary across economic sectors, industries, firms and skill categories based on labour productivity and profit of underlying production activities. Meantime, various state policies prevail on minimum wages of public employees and various private industries/trades. Information on labour income of other employed categories such as entrepreneurs, capital owners and self-employed is not available.
* Interaction between Wages and Economy
In general, wages in public sector and organised private sector do not immediately respond to changes in production activities as these wages are fixed by formal agreements with trade unions and state policies for certain periods such as annual or several years. Wages are reviewed periodically to compensate for increase in cost of living and profit of production activities. Therefore, wages in the organised/formal sector are considered sticky.
In contrast, wages in the informal sector respond to labour market conditions, i.e., changes in demand for and supply of labour, as employment is not driven by labour laws such as minimum wages and employee protection. However, there is no reliable and consistent series of wage information on the informal sector.
The increase in wages generally shows tight labour market conditions due to high momentum of growth of economic activities. It is also an early warning of inflation possible in the immediate future when increased labour income is spent. Therefore, inflation is generally expected in periods of business growth because of resulting increase in wages.
In economics, real wages are mostly analyzed to see whether wages are adequate to offset the effects of inflation on living standards. Labour disputes arise primarily due to inflation higher than increase in wages.
* Wage Indices
Like consumer price indices, wage indices are used to show the movements of wages combined for various categories of employees as it is statistically difficult to compare wages of employee categories separately over the period. In Sri Lanka, a consistent series of wage indices from 1978 is published for central government employees and private sector employees falling under minimum wages of Wages Boards Trades (21).
According to data, monetary/nominal wages have increased between 1978 and 2017 by 84 times for government employees and 41 times for employees in wages boards trades. However, real wages (wages deflated to remove the increase in cost of living or consumer price index) have increased only about 2 times for government employees and one time for wage boards trades employees. Meanwhile, real GDP, i.e., GDP after removing the increase in consumer price index or inflation, has increased by 7 times during this period. This means that the increase in real wages has been relatively far below the increase in the countrys real production/income. Therefore, improvement in living standards of the majority public (paid employees) has been slower.
See table
Policy Priorities
All fiscal, monetary and sectoral economic policies target the promotion of both economic activities employment opportunities in order to raise the growth of production and reduce unemployment. The economic development that does not reduce the unemployment to low levels (natural rates) cannot be considered as a healthy development. The unemployment being generally high among the youth and educated persons could cause unsettled civil conditions. The male-female gap is also a social concern.
In general, economic policies are expected to drive macroeconomic activities that enable people to find regular jobs for improving living standards of their families while minimizing general consumer subsidies. Therefore, authorities must address several fundamental issues to improve human resource/labour management.
* Statistical Problem
What matters for living standards is the availability of regular jobs that enables persons to earn a level of income compatible with average household cost. Therefore, labour force information should cover definitions suitable for domestic requirements in addition to international definitions.
The delay and poor quality of information also are the bottlenecks to monitor the response of the labour market to economic policies. Therefore, certain proxies must be used to assess the movements of employment within short lags, i.e., one month. In the US, non-farm payroll and average hourly wage are used for this purpose. In Sri Lanka, employee-members and wages of employees covered in the Employees Provident Funds and Employers Trust Fund are good proxies, if member accounts can be maintained without multiple accounts for same employees when they change employment.
* Labour Market Flexibility
Most economists believe that rigid labour laws provide excessive protection to employees outside economic factors and prevent the labour market from adjusting to the performance of the economy and skill development. Therefore, firms/employers tend to have diverse arrangements to hire labour outside labour laws and, as a result, it has been difficult to adopt a formal reporting of employment and wage information. A periodical review of labour laws is necessary to facilitate both new economies and labour market efficiency.
* Globally Competitive Education System
Development of both labour skills and productivity has to come from a globally competitive education system. This will enhance employability of human resource/labour where any excess labour is easily absorbable by global markets. Therefore, education system covering school and technical has to be consistent with skill-needs of the global economy.
* Business Credit Delivery System
Credit is the spine of production and business that generate employment and income for people. Therefore, financial system should be designed to provide a wider set of credit instruments inclusive of venture capital in addition to bank credit that can finance a wider spectrum of business risks for innovation and promotion of business activities. Such a credit system should facilitate mobilization of all resources for economic development and better living standards.
To ensure better economic democracy, policymakers need to announce a time-bound policy framework for the economy to reach full employment for better living standards of population.

Azhar leads Pakistan fightback  as Hafeez calls time on Test cricket
Abu Dhabi, Tuesday: Azhar Ali struck a fighting half century to help Pakistan recover to 139-3 at close on the second day of the third and final Test against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday.
It marked a good recovery from 17-2 after Kiwi pace bowler Trent Boult ripped out openers Imam-ul-Haq and Mohammed Hafeez, who later announced his retirement from Test cricket.
Azhar was unbeaten on 62 at the close having shared a dogged, unbroken fourth wicket partnership of 54 with Asad Shafiq who will resume on 26.
Pakistan are still 135 runs adrift of New Zealands first innings total of 274 in which BJ Watling made a gutsy and vital 77 not out.
The three-match series is tied at 1-1 after New Zealand won the first Test in Abu Dhabi by four runs before Pakistan bounced back with an innings and 16-run win in the second in Dubai.
Azhar remains key for Pakistan if they are to build any kind of first innings lead.
The 33-year-old dropped anchor and found the boundary just four times as he crawled through to his 32nd Test half century. His 62 not out was carved painstakingly from 169 deliveries as the Pakistan scoring rate struggled to rise above two an over.
The equally-experienced Shafiq hit the same number of fours in his 26 which has so far occupied 85 balls.
Farewell Hafeez
The Pakistan top order was jolted by Boults double strike either side of lunch.
Hafeez has been struggling for form for a while, having made just 66 runs in seven innings since scoring a hundred against Australia in Dubai in October, following his recall to the Test side after a two-year absence.
It was no surprise when Boult had him caught low down at second slip by Tim Southee for a fourth-ball duck in his first over, right before the lunch interval.
Hafeez, 38, who made his debut against Bangladesh in 2003, announced at the close of play that this Test, his 55th, would be his last.
I feel time is up, said Hafeez who has scored 3644 runs, with 10 hundreds and 12 half centuries.
In the fourth full over after the break, Imam-ul-Haq took his eye off a Trent bouncer and was hit on the back of the helmet. Next ball, he edged to Southee at third slip and was on his way for just nine. Azhar then dug in with Haris Sohail, adding 68 for the third wicket before Sohail edged Southee to Watling behind the stumps for 34. It was Watling, with an unbeaten 77, who carried New Zealands overnight total from 229-7 and added an invaluable 45 runs over the last three wickets to frustrate Pakistan. During his five-and-a-half-hour knock in his 56th Test Watling became the 14th New Zealander to pass 3,000 runs.
Watling, dropped on nine by Imam off Bilal Asif on Monday, and debutant Will Somerville extended their eighth wicket partnership to 45 before Bilal Asif took all three final wickets to finish with 5-65, his second five wicket haul in five Tests.
The 33-year-old playing his 56th Test, reached his 16th Test half-century. His 77 not out came from 199 balls in five hours and 32 minutes, and included four boundaries.AFP

Badminton faces big financial problems finding sponsors  SLB president
We are very happy to see our young shuttlers perform at the recently concluded South Asian under 21 badminton championships in Nepal, said Sri Lanka Badminton president Nishantha Jayasinghe at the Katunayake Airport yesterday.
Junior shuttlers who returned with three bronze medals and two silver medals yesterday morning and were welcomed by the Badminton chief and the other officials at the airport.
Jayasinghe further said, We have selected eight shuttlers for this Nepal tour and they won bronze medal at the team event, while two silver and a bronze medal was won in the individual events. This is very good exposure for these juniors. Actually we wanted to promote the players from the junior level and give them this type of International tours. Those days a few players had the opportunity to go on this type of foreign tours. They got all the opportunities and never gave a chance to the others. I wanted to change this system. If we select the same players how can we upgrade the standard of badminton in the country
Ranthushka Sasindu who became mens singles runner-up at the National championships performed very well on the Nepal tour winning two silver medals. He won the medals in the mens singles and partnered by Dilmi Dias the mixed doubles. In addition Hasini Ambalangodage won the womens singles bronze medal. Earlier Hasini had won the gold at the recently concluded Youth Olympic Games. Chamath Dias and Chirath Illeperuma won the mens doubles bronze medal.
These players are our future, said the badminton chief. Actually we have difficulties to find the money for these types of tours. Sometimes the Sports Ministry has come forward to assist us but most of the time our players have to pocket out their own expenses and the balance money is met by Sri Lanka Badminton.
We face a big financial problem and it is very difficult to find sponsors for this type of tours, said the badminton chief.

Cabinet suspension, House dissolution to receive equal priority
The continuing tensions between the executive and the legislative branches of the government are now before the judiciary in the form of numerous petitions and appeals.
According to legal luminaries, the UNPs petition against the Presidents dissolution of Parliament and the UPFAs appeal against on Monday against the interim injunction suspending the Cabinet are likely to be heard by the Supreme Court with equal priority.
Vasudeva Nanayakkara said the United National Party and their allies have placed petitions against them in ostensible order.
They have invoked jurisdiction successfully and successively, he said, However, the ostensible result of their actions has been disturbed franchise of the masses, the peoples right to vote, he said.
He said, The Courts are trying to listen to the allegations leveled against us by the United National Party (UNP) members over the Presidents dissolution of Parliament and the office of the Presidents newly appointed Prime Minister which replaced Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The Courts are trying to do its best, but we must confess that the Court of Appeals interim order issued on Monday suspending the Cabinet was unreasonable and wrongful, he said.
Asked how they would carry on after it, Nanayakkara said, We are determined to carry on, and act within a legal framework. He said they would act in conformity with reason.
The Court has issued the interim order restraining the functions of the Cabinet appointed by the President pending hearing of a Quo Warranto petition filed by 122 members among them Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was sacked from the office of the Prime Minister by the President.
We prepared an appeal and a affidavit against this Interim Order that very day.I signed it. The petition was handed over to the Supreme Court today (December 4), he said.
Asked how long it could take to reach a resolution, he said: this is a matter of paramount importance.I think that the Supreme Court will give priority to this. It would be solved within a week.
This could mean that the Supreme Court Judge Benches will have to make necessary divisions to hear the petition on the dissolution of Parliament and the appeal against the interim injunction suspending the Cabinet, he maintained.

President instructs Ministry Secretaries
Carry out public  services as usual

President Maithripala Sirisena has issued instructions and guidelines to secretaries of ministries to carry out public services without disruption in keeping with existing laws and regulations.
This is consequent to the Court of Appeal issuing an Interim Order restraining the Prime Minister and the Cabinet appointed by him according to the provisions of the Constitution from holding their respective offices until a final determination is made by Court.
The President issued these instructions at a special discussion with secretaries of all Ministries held at the Presidential Secretary yesterday.
The presidents media division said the President has already issued directives to all members of the Public Service, armed forces and police to perform their duties and responsibilities relentlessly on behalf of state security, the country and the public in a situation of this nature.
President has no such powers - UNP
The Central Bureau of the United National Party said the Constitution has no clause which empowers the President to issue any orders or instructions to Ministry Secretaries as stated.
The UNP was referring to a statement issued by the Presidents Media Division yesterday.
In a statement issued by Kurunegala District MP and former Home Affairs State Minister J. C. Alawathuwala, the Central Bureau of the UNP further said that according to section 52 (2) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, a Ministry Secretary should operate government departments and institutions under the purview of the Minister
according to the orders and administration of the Minister. According to section 42 (1) of the constitution, there should be a Cabinet of Ministers to supervise the administration of the Republican government to be in charge of issuing such orders.
But according to the No-Confidence Motion passed in Parliament on November 14 and thereafter and the Stay Order issued by the Court of Appeal on December 3, there is no Cabinet of Ministers in operation now.
As such there is no authority which can issue orders and directives to Ministry Secretaries now. The President can issue orders and directives in keeping with the constitutional provisions to Ministries under his purview only.
Given this situation, it was unconstitutional on the part of the President to issue orders and directives to Ministry Secretaries, the UNP release said.
It should be emphasised that all Ministry Secretaries were duty bound to carry out their functions according to the Administrative and Financial Regulations taking into cognizance the proposals to cut down expenditure heads approved by Parliament recently. Without doing so anyone following unconstitutional orders and directives would amount to a breaching of the Constitution and a grave wrong, the UNP statements said.
President advices all the ministerial secretaries to continue work
The interim order issued by Court of Appeal does not prevail functioning of office. President has issued of directives to be followed by the secretaries of the respective ministries to carryout the official work without interruption.
The President chaired a special meeting with the Secretaries to all ministries at the Presidential Secretariat this morning, the Presidents Media Division said.

Case against Gota, six others fixed for day-to-day trial


The case filed against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and six others was yesterday fixed for day-to-day trial by the Permanent High Court-at-Bar.
This is in connection with the case filed alleging that the D.A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial in Medamulana was built using public funds amounting to Rs.33.9 million. The Trial-at-Bar bench comprising High Court Judges Sampath Abeykoon (President), Sampath Wijeratne and Champa Janaki Rajaratne fixed the case to be heard on a day-to-day basis commencing January 22, 2019.

CAUG threatens protests during polls
Convenor of the Combine Association of Unemployed Graduates (CAUG) Ven. Thanne Gnanananda Thera said members of their association are keen on violating the election rules again if the government fails to address their issues.
Ven. Gnanananda Thera was speaking at a media conference yesterday in Colombo.
The Thera added that the government should take prompt action to end the unemployment of graduates.
According to the CAUG, there are around 80,000 vacancies available in the state service which can be filled with graduates.
The government should fill these vacancies with the unemployed graduates.
If the government fails to settle our issue, we are eagerly looking forward to breaking the election laws once again as we did during the last election.
We will engage in protests violating election laws, if an election is called, he said.
Speaking on the CAUG protest held on Monday in Colombo, the Thera said police attacked them when they were going to the Presidential Secretariat to hand over a letter to the President.
We have sent 10 letters to the President requesting a discussion with him.
But until today we havent received a favourable response. However, we have come to know that new employees have been recruited to several ministries recently, he said.
They are ready to discuss long-term and short-term remedies to end the unemployment of graduates with the President, the Thera said.
The CAUG will launch a countrywide protest campaign soon urging the government to recruit unemployed graduates to the state service , he said.
Achintha Divanjana of the CAUG said teargas, baton charges or water cannons cannot stop their struggle.

Creativity across clouds
As Confucius, the Chinese prophet, pointed out, the creativity of a culture is the mirror that reflects the sensitivity of the people who live in it. On reading the 28 short stories selected from the seven SAARC countries titled as Chasing the Clouds, I felt how true the dictum of Confucius remains to this date.
The stories are selected by a board of five eminent editors. Their details are given in the compilation. They carry a high calibre of suitability in the process. The nations from which these short stories are selected go as Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The unity in diversity in the creative process is shown as the key vision in these varying types of short stories as selected from indigenous creative sources.
Original languages
The collection is published by the Foundation of SAARC Writers and Literature wing of the Academy of Fine Arts and Literature in New Delhi, India, in 2005. Most narratives are translated from the original languages by the creators, themselves and by some others well versed in English. According to the foreword by the chairperson of the Pakistan Academy of Letters, the seven-nation organization had come into being in 1985 with the objectives of closer collaborating in all fields to help bring about betterment in the life of the people of the region through the promotion of socio-economic, cultural commercial and scientific ties among the member states.
It is in this direction that the meeting point of the creative writers got together annually in order to discuss matters relating to the creative and cultural activities of each country.
It is further stated that be it religion, language, race or creed, the colour of the skin or the feature of the face, the profession of variety that abounds across the land of the seven countries is not found anywhere in the world. The arts and kinds of literature that spring from the colourful font cannot be simply be captured in a single view of the scene.
But a unifying sentiment runs through the kaleidoscopic creativity of the people that one sees in their yearning for peace, progress and friendly co-existence. In a Word With You by Ajeet Cour, the chairperson of the Foundation of SAARC Writers and literature of India, the compilation is visualized as a need of the hour. It is what the SAARC has been striving for since inception.
Literary expression
Though the Foundation had been engaged in the function of bringing out various collections of essays, poems, fiction and other genres of literary expression, the attempt could be well regarded as the culmination of these efforts. As Asif Frakhi, one of the compiler editors points out in the brief note titled Stories of South Asia, the people have a stock of stories and as the people do, they come in all shapes and sizes. And to each his/her own story.
Care and concern for these people give shape to the many stories. These are the ordinary people living in these countries. As observed in an analytic frame, a reader may see that the milk of human kindness flows through most of these narratives. The pains and sorrows in the lives are sensitively captured in these stories.
Take, for instance, the opening story titled as Ants by Hunayan Ahmed. The protagonist in the narrative meets a doctor who seems to listen to the patient in order to diagnose the sickness. The doctor who is more of a psychotherapist comes to know that a patient comes to narrate the constant happening of ants that irritate his body and mind. It is a case beyond the common day-to-day event.
It is nothing but an alarming event that goes on in the following words.
It was the monsoon, hot and humid. The bodies had decomposed and emanated repulsive smell. I took the police officer to the mango tree from where hung the bitchs dead body. A horrifying scene awaited us. Millions of real ants clung to the corpse. It looked as if the body were covered with a red bed sheet. The same thing had happened to the girls body as well. The face, hands and legs were not visible at all
Points of view
Though the narrative looks quite gruesome and horrifying, the layer of realism and fantasy could be seen mixed into one entity. The portrayal of the character of the patient could be interpreted from different points of view. Even though the narrative could be interpreted in many modes of vision, the salient factor is the state of the sick mind of a repentant in an aftermath of a crime.
The story from India titled as The Forbidden Fruit by Asghar Waghdad revolves around an experiment on the behaviour of lions and humans. The reader sees that lions that are caught from the jungle, when brought to the town are fed on tinned food. As time goes on, an experiment is conducted in order to see the behaviour of the lions that were caged are released in the areas of the jungle where they roamed. The experiment proves that though the lions leave the cages, they are more or less hungry.
But the wild forest dwellers who are human accept to live in the empty cages left behind by the lions. They go on eating the tinned food that was given to the lions that were released. On reading the narrative, I felt that the writers intention is quite serious. He wants to depict the true nature of the gradually changing behaviour patterns of the humans who pose as animal lovers.
The original Hindi story is translated into English by Robert Bernard as the author. The two narratives from Sri Lanka too are worthy of mention. The story titled The Bull under the Bodhi Tree by Kamala Wijeratne (225pp) and The Birth of Golden Swan by Tissa Abeysekara resemble the narratives drawn from the indigenous folklore translation, where religious susceptibilities play a vital role in the expression.
All in all, the collection is a gift to the world in search of peace and co-existence.

Poachers hunt deer in Hambantota daily, residents in the area said.
They say the high demand for venison among tourists resulted in hunting deer in a massive scale.
The poachers sell venison to hotels and restaurants since foreigners buy cooked venison at high prices, they said.
Meanwhile, prices of eggs have increased in Hambantota. Poultry farmers said the rising cost of food for chickens impacts badly on the business.
A large number of young people in poultry farming undergo severe hardships since they cannot afford the high cost of what they need for the field.

Divided SC judgement not acceptable - Thera
A divided judgement by the Supreme Court on the petitions filed against the dissolution of Parliament will not be accepted, SriJayewardenepuraUniversity Senior Lecturer Ven. MedagodaAbhayatissaTherasaid.
Responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference organised by the Eliya foundation at the National Library and Documentation Services Board yesterday, the Thera said there could not be multiple interpretations of the law.
There must be uniformity in the interpretation of the countrys law. Different judges cannot see it in different ways. We are not ready to accept a divided judgement, he said.
A seven-member bench of the Supreme Court yesterday commenced hearing on the petitions filed against the dissolution of Parliament.
The Thera, along with senior artistes Sudath Rohana and Shriyantha Mendis, however said they were keenly awaiting the SC decision on December 7. They added that they have no doubt that the SC would deem the Presidents act of dissolving Parliament as correct and legal.
Ven. Abhayatissa Thera, further interpreting Articles 33 and 70 of the Constitution, argued that the President could dissolve Parliament at any time. The restriction of four-and-a-half years only applies when the MPs themselves sought to dissolve Parliament. The No-Confidence Motions moved after dissolution of Parliament on November 9 have no effect. There can be only former MPs after the dissolution. What we now urge is an election. An election is a sovereign right of the people. Only those who plundered the countrys assets and resources fear to face an election, he said.
Senior Artiste Shiyantha Mendis said it was clear that the entire country had plunged into a political crisis.
He noted that however the crisis did not start on October 26, but on January 9, 2015, as President Maithripala Sirisena appointed Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister. Nobody asked for a Parliamentary majority then. Nobody went before the courts. The crisis deepened because of arbitrary and anti-patriotic decisions made by Wickremesinghe, he said.
Asked by a journalist to comment on the controversial payments received by Ven. Dhambara Amila Thera, Ven. Abhayatissa Thera said he wishes to remain non-committal as the Thera was his friend in university.

Empowering plantation community
Plantation workers are poised for a mass work stoppage if the Management Companies fail to meet their demand for a daily wage of Rs. 1000/. All politicians in the plantation sector, these days, are vying with each other to be the first to claim credit for delivering this bounty to their community. Ceylon Workers Congress Leader and former Minister Arumugam Thondaman on Monday requested all estate workers to join an indefinite strike from yesterday (04). According to him, the Plantation Management Company heads, whom he met, were not amenable to a Rs. 1000/ daily wage for the workers. They (Management Companies) also turned down a request by the Finance Ministry to grant interest free loans to the estate workers, he said.
In the past, in such instances, one could be certain that Thondamans grandfather Saumyamoorthy Thondaman would have led a massive Satyagraha running into days to win over the demands of his community. It appears, though, that the magic of the Thondaman name has lost its allure. Even in the ousted Government, former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe denied him a Cabinet portfolio, the first time a Thondaman was snubbed in this fashion. The legendary political bargaining power of the Grand Old man of the Thottam is today conspicuous by its absence, where Thondaman junior is concerned.
Gone are the days when the plantation workers had their messiah to look up to. Thondaman Snr always delivered as promised and in return exacted the largesse for his community from the Government of the day guaranteeing they (workers) voted en-bloc to whichever political party he chooses to support. It was the vote of the plantations that tilted the scales in many a recent election. This was clearly seen in the Presidential Election of 1988. Had not Premadasa secured the support of Thondaman, Mrs. Bandaranaike would have been the victor at that poll. That was why no political leader was keen to rub him on the wrong side.
That was the time when Thondaman Snr wielded much clout with the Central Government and almost made it do his bidding towards the welfare of the plantation workers. This is why he had the pick of the Cabinet portfolios for himself under JRJ, Premadasa, D. B. Wijetunga and the Chandrika administrations.
Since his demise though the plantation community remained a neglected lot, with Thondaman Jnr only a pale shadow of the grand old man who strutted his plantation fiefdom like a colossus. Nay, the name no longer has any appeal in the plantations according to many observers with the Digambarams and the Vadivels taking over the mantle. Apparently, the estate community has seen through the farce. What they are receiving today is only lip service from the younger Thondaman who has made switching sides for the rewards and bounties, a fine art.
It is time the plantation community receives proper leadership who can air their grievances with conviction. It is only right that they be served well, given the contribution they make to the national economy. Let alone their wages, their living conditions are still in a primitive state, with large families huddled together in single room hovels that are called line rooms. Children in the plantations usually take after their parents and would not think of a world out of their limited existence. They hardly attend school and are struck by malnutrition. Estates also lack basic infrastructure and schools without facilities and devoid of the full quota of teachers. Alcoholism is also rampant among the plantation community, particularly given the drudgery of the work and ignorance about the ill effects.
There is therefore an urgent need to deliver this community from their current existence and get them absorbed into the general society. They should be provided with the necessary facilities and the wherewithal to redeem themselves from their backwardness. The demand for a daily wage of Rs. 1000/- is not unfair by all accounts. Nay, it could be considered chickenfeed by living standards in the city. This could barely be sufficient for food alone, even in the estates, where the community is used to living a spartan existence. One must also not forget that there will be a large number of sole breadwinners with large families who will have to make do with this pittance.
Hence, the Government should intervene and strike a bargain with the management companies with or without Thondamans involvement. The stock excuse by the Management Companies has always been that they could not afford high wages due to the slump in world tea prices. This excuse is often trotted out even when collective agreements come up for discussions. If things continue in the same vein then there will never be a wage hike in the foreseeable future which will place the estate workers in a severe plight. Hence the need for the powers that be to work out a formula where the plantation community will be able to at least secure a living wage to tide over their hardships.

Energy positive hotel
Norwegian architecture and design firm Snhetta has been commissioned to create a sustainable hotel at the foot of a glacier located just above the Arctic Circle. Building in such an environmentally fragile location has called for innovative solutions and Snhetta has delivered in a big way through their design.
Svart will be the worlds first Powerhouse hotel, meaning that it will generate more energy than it consumes. Named after the Svartisen glacier in northern Norway, Svart will have an energy consumption rate that is 85 percent less than standard hotels. All of this is possible through careful research and design on the part of Snhetta.
Building in such a precious environment comes with some clear obligations in terms of preserving the natural beauty and the fauna and flora of the site, shares Snhettas Founding Partner Kjetil Trdal Thorsen. It was important for us to design a sustainable building that will leave a minimal environmental footprint on this beautiful Northern nature.
Svart juts out into the waters of the Holandsfjorden fjord, its circular shape affording panoramic views of the landscape. Its construction, though contemporary, is based in local tradition. The worn wood that forms the structures frame and support poles was inspired by the rorbue - a traditional seasonal house used by local fishermen. Additionally, the A-shaped beams that plunge into the Arctic waters recall the forms of a fiskehjell, a wooden structure used to dry fish.
Furthering the goal to make Svart a pioneering structure in sustainable tourism, the hotel can only be accessed by boat. Currently, there are plans to introduce a neutral energy boat shuttle from the city of Bod. Solar panels laid across the hotels rooftop were aligned with the suns rays in order to create optimal energy generation. Geothermal wells will capture ground energy for heating and all the rooms, terraces, and the restaurant have been strategically positioned to take advantage of shade during the summer months.
The facades large windows give an illusion of transparency while also allowing plenty of natural light to filter into the space - a concept that is key above the Arctic Circle. Scheduled to open in 2021, the Svart is just the first of many Powerhouse buildings Snhetta is looking to construct together with partners Arctic Adventure, Asplan Vaak, and Skanska.

ESTATE WAGE issue: Stakeholders unwilling to compromise
The ongoing simmering estate wage crisis was gridlocked yesterday with both the Planters Association and the estate unions unwilling to compromise on their earlier positions.
This was amid the backdrop of the estate unions beginning what it called an indefinite strike until the payment of Rs. 1000 per day wage was delivered to them.
The Planters Association was adamant that the maximum they could give was Rs. 940 per day and that too which they could barely afford, but estate unions were adamant that the workers were determined on the Rs. 1000 daily wage they insisted from Day 1.
We have promised them Rs. 940 per day, which we could barely afford, which will cost the RPCs an additional Rs. 6.3 billion and another Rs. 5 billion in EPF and other emoluments, a top PA spokesman told Daily News Business yesterday amid the upcountry Regional Plantation Companies employees striking work from yesterday.
He also insisted that the so- called strike which Unions were claiming successful, were restricted to the upcountry areas, but yet 30%-40% even in the upcountry areas reported to work yesterday.
There was 100% attendance of RPC workers in the low country plantation areas, he assured.
These workers would also realize their folly when they dont get paid while striking work and they are bound to return to work today (5) or tomorrow (6), he said.
He also drew the attention of the estate unions led by the CWC to the backdrop of the dwindling global tea and rubber prices as of now asked from the estate unions how they were able to pay Rs. 1000 per day in that type of export market backdrop. This, he said, was also within a dangerous backdrop of the possibility of Sri Lankas tea buying countries shifting to competing markets such as Kenya, India and Indonesia.
Meanwhile CWC Vice President Arul Samy who was with the striking workers at the time he was contacted by Daily News Business for comment, asserted that the strike was very successful and that the workers were adamant that they will continue till the Rs. 1000 per day was paid to them.
We have insisted that the minimum daily wage should be Rs. 1000 and the productivity and attendance bonuses could be added to that, he said.
Responding to a question as to what the reaction of the unions was to the Planters Association Offer of the Productivity Bonus which enabled an estate worker to get Rs. 1800 per day or more, he asserted that he was yet to see the proposal!

Fitch downgrades Sri Lanka to B from B+
Fitch Ratings has downgraded Sri Lankas Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to B from B+, with a Stable Outlook.
The downgrade reflects heightened external refinancing risks, an uncertain policy outlook, and the risk of a slowdown in fiscal consolidation as a result of an ongoing political crisis following the Presidents replacement of the Prime Minister on October 26, 2018.
Fitch believes the ongoing political upheaval, which has disrupted the normal functioning of parliament, exacerbates the countrys external financing risks, already challenged by the tightening of global monetary conditions amid a heavy external debt repayment schedule between 2019 and 2022.
Investor confidence has been undermined, as evident from large outflows from the local bond market and a depreciating exchange rate. The sovereigns foreign currency-denominated debt repayments (principal and interest), as of end-September 2018 are about USD20.9 billion between 2019 and 2022, while its foreign-exchange reserves are currently about USD7.5 billion.
The authorities plan to raise funds through a combination of bilateral and commercial borrowing and the exercise of foreign-currency swaps, but there are risks to this strategy that could arise from a prolonged period of political uncertainty accompanied by an adverse shift in investor sentiment.
Fitch expects fiscal slippages as the current political climate is likely to lead to delays in setting policy priorities and to disrupt progress on future reforms. The 2019 budget has already been pushed back, while the IMF programme has been put on hold.
The agency now expects the budget deficit for 2019 and 2020 to be closer to 5% of GDP, up from 4.0% of GDP in 2019 - forecast at the time of our previous review. The political strife has also exacerbated a depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee, which had weakened in 2018 by around 17% against the US dollar up until end-November, contributing to deterioration in the debt profile - with about half the debt denominated in foreign currency.
Fitch has therefore revised up their general government debt-GDP forecast to over 80% by end-2018, from 77.2%. We believe a speedy resolution of the political situation and a return to credible macroeconomic policies could eventually lower fiscal risks.
S&P Global too downgrades SL
S&P Global Ratings said on Tuesday it too lowered Sri Lankas sovereign credit rating to B from B+, but maintained its outlook at stable.

Former left arm leggie Jayaweera in town
Former Thurstan and Saracens left arm leg spinner who met with success for his school and club is in town with his charming wife Prasani on a short holiday from Sydney, Australia.
Jayaweera sported Thurstan College colours from 1971 to 1973. He met with amazing success in the 1973 season capturing a record 68 wickets with his biting left arm spin that had all opposing batsman bewildered. In 1973 he had the Maliyadeva College, Krunegala batsmen in a flat spin pocketing a match bag of 11 for 119 with some rarely seen high class bowling.
After a highly successful school cricket season, he joined the Rifle Green Club Saracens where under former all rounders Ralston Burke and Percy Perera he continued his success. Burke was an old Kandy Antonian and Perera an Old Benedictine who was in addition a classy basketball player who was adjudged the Best Shooter in Asia Games Basketball tournament in 1966.
Jayaweera speaks highly of Burke who he says was one of the best off spinning all rounders of that era.
He was a hard hitting right hand batsman and a cunning off spinner. Perera he said was a fine paceman who could swing the ball both ways and packed a vicious bouncer. Jayantha is the brother of the illustrious Sunil Jayaweera and Indrani. Indrani is married to former 800 metre Ceylon record holder and Old Benedictine Prasad Perera. Indrani was a former 400 metre Ceylon record holder. Sunil needs no introduction to sportsmen and sports fans in the country as a sportsman and top class administrator. Jayantha Jayaweera is a British qualified Civil Engineer by profession and has been living in Sydney, Australia since 1989.
It was nice meeting Jayaweera and talking of old times, especially cricket where every player enjoyed the game because it was played in the best of spirits.
When asked about Sri Lanka cricket he said that the cricketers have talent, but was sad to note that they lacked determination and commitment. ER

GSK to divest Horlicks, other products to Unilever
Following the completion of its previously announced strategic review, GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) announced the divestment of Horlicks and other consumer healthcare nutrition brands to Unilever plc (Unilever) and the merger of GSK Consumer Healthcare Limited (GSK India) with Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) for a total consideration valued at approximately 3.1 billion based on the 15-day volume weighted average price (VWAP) ending Friday 30 November 2018 of HUL shares of INR1,717. Net proceeds are estimated to be approximately 2.4 billion on the same basis.
In India, Horlicks and other nutrition products are sold by GSK India, a public company listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), in which GSK holds a 72.5% stake.
The proposed transaction involves the merger of GSK India with HUL, a public company listed on the NSE and BSE, following which GSK will own approximately 5.7% of HUL. The merger values GSK India at INR317 billion in total, or INR7,540 per share, a 15.4% premium to the un-disturbed share price of INR6,531 as at close of business on 26 March 2018.
Following completion of the transaction, currently expected by the end of 2019, GSK intends to sell down its holding in HUL.
In addition, GSK is to sell its 82% stake in GlaxoSmithKline Bangladesh Limited and other related brand rights for GSKs consumer healthcare nutrition activities in certain other territories to Unilever, for which it is expected to receive cash proceeds equivalent to 566 million.
India remains an important market for GSK and the company will continue to invest in growth opportunities for its OTC and Oral Health brands there, which include Crocin, Eno and Sensodyne.
HUL is the largest FMCG Company in the country, with strong distribution reaching over seven million outlets across India.
Emma Walmsley, Chief Executive Officer, GSK, said: Horlicks has made a significant contribution to GSK and to the health of consumers across India for many decades and we believe Unilever is well placed to maximise its future potential. Proceeds from this transaction will be used to support the Groups strategic priorities, including investing in our pharmaceutical business.
The transaction is conditional on the approval of the merger by the shareholders and creditors of each of GSK India and HUL. Total consideration receivable by GSK is therefore expected to have a value of approximately 3.1 billion.
The net proceeds receivable by GSK are currently estimated at around 2.4 billion. The final amount of net proceeds received will only be determined once the shares in HUL to be received have been monetised and after hedging costs, taxes and other expenses have been settled.

His Grace Archbishop Emeritus Nicholas Marcus Fernando :
Illustrious Son of Little Rome
Four score and six is a glorious innings in these cricketing days. One wonders how it feels to be 86 years of age in this twenty-first century for a colossus of the Catholic Church. Though ranked among the 80 Club and bestowed with Emeritus status, His Grace Archbishop Most Rev. Dr. Nicholas Marcus Fernando was at the helm of Sri Lankas flock as the Chief Shepherd for well nigh 25 years.
Little has changed in that familiar exterior at Emmaus in Tewatte where he spends his retirement in the environs of the Basilica of Our Lady of Lanka. Archbishop Fernando, as he is still affectionately referred to, does not look a day older than when he opted to call it a day at 69  17 years ago. He is very relaxed and fit, but prefers to respect old age and to be identified as a senior citizen. In the annals of Christianity in Sri Lanka, he truly played a decisive role as the Chief Shepherd of the Archdiocese of Colombo, despite his comparatively young age of 44.
He was respected as a scholar, a man of integrity and a linguist of no mean repute. He was fluent in English, Sinhala and Tamil and had a command of many other languages as well. With constancy and care, Archbishop Fernando laboured along with the priests, religious lay catechists and the faithful during his tenure as the Chief Shepherd, not only for the effective promotion of evangelisation of the people, but also for the provision of earthly needs of the flock and social progress of all classes.
Glimpses of a shepherd
I am truly blessed to have sailed the early years of my life on the course steered by Archbishop Fernando. We were born as parishioners of St. Marys Church, Grand Street, Negombo; christened at St. Marys Church, Grand Street, Negombo; educated at St. Marys College, Grand Street, Negombo and grew up in the confines of St. Marys Church, Grand Street, Negombo.
The life-long reminiscences for a Maryite of that era could be the beautiful bronze statue of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary that occupied the niche of the Main Block of the College, the life-like statue of the founder, Rev. Fr. J. B. Vistarini that stands before the faade of the church, and the Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes in the precincts of the church.
Rev. Vistarini was the Parish Priest of the majestic church and was considered a living saint. His last resting place is at the side altar where his grave is identified with his statue in repose. After his death, hundreds of sons of Negombo were named after him and he shall always remain in the hearts and minds as their first saint.
Reverting to the life of Archbishop Fernando, I was the Head Prefect at St. Marys College, Negombo, when the good news from the Holy See in Rome of his elevation reached the city of Negombo, well known as Little Rome. I vividly remember how the bells of the grand old church peeled and how the people of all walks of life in Negombo united to share the joy of producing the first son of the parish as the Archbishop of Colombo.
Ever since, I was privileged to associate with the then serving Archbishop of Colombo, all along my career as a Naval Officer. During my schooldays, he was my hero. In my youth, I preferred him to be my role model. As the years rolled by, he became my mentor and later spiritual director  a unique bond of friendship that has now flourished for 40 long years.
Year after year, I have never failed to wish His Grace on his Patronal Feast and Birthday and His Grace reciprocates as our birthdays fall on December 6 and 16. His Grace never fails to contact me whenever he reads anything I have penned, to congratulate, to inspire, and to motivate me. He has always been pleasant, unassuming and easy to talk to.
As I linger down memory lane, many nostalgic events of my association with him flash before my mind and I would like to share a few. His Grace installed me as the youngest President of the OBA of St. Marys College, Negombo. I was privileged to confer on His Grace the prestigious Award of Excellence for the Old Maryite of the Century.
Then, I was privileged to deliver the keynote speech at the book launch to mark the Silver Jubilee of his Episcopal Ordination and to lend a helping hand for him to settle down at Emmaus in retirement. His Grace always reminds me of our unforgettable pilgrimage to the Basilica of Our Lady of Good Health in Vailankanni amidst a severe threat of floods.
His Grace kindly consented to preside at the first-ever Joint Christian Service of Commemoration and Thanksgiving of the Sri Lanka Navy in 1991 and immensely helped me to conduct the service for 25 uninterrupted years amidst ups and downs. He was present at All Saints Church, Borella, to renew our wedding vows when Carmel and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary.
Birth and divine call
In the Register of Baptism at St. Marys Church, Grand Street, Negombo, that boasts a legacy of 455 years, the name Nicholas Marcus appears as the 115th entry in the year 1932. He was christened on December 13, in the presence of his beloved parents, Wilfred Severinus Fernando and Mary Lily Margaret Fernando, with Theophilus Fernando and Maria Harriet Fernando as God Parents.
He was born a week earlier on December 6 in the renowned fishing hamlet of Munnakkara. Incidentally, it was on their feast day and the church and the city are dedicated to St. Nicholas. Thus, his humble and pious parents who cherished the proper endowment of spiritual values to their children would have been encouraged to name him after St. Nicholas.
Archbishop Fernando is the second child in the family and he has seven siblings. According to the order of birth, they are Frank, Archbishop Nicholas Marcus, Benzy, Camillus, Victor, Beryl, Nicholas Alexis and Maureen. Archbishop Fernando had his primary education at the Roman Catholic Mixed School in Munnakkara.
Then, he entered the leading Catholic educational institution, St. Marys College, Grand Street, Negombo, where he was beckoned by God to His vineyard to enable him to fulfil his allotted vocation. The effusive showering of talents and the providential timing of his birth made young Nicholas Marcus more and more conscious of his obligations before God. These ideas and ideals which matured in him from childhood made him what he became.
Responding with devotion to the Divine call, he entered St. Aloysius Seminary, Borella, in 1945 and passed the SSC Examination with exemption from the London Matriculation in 1949, the London University Inter-Arts Examination in 1951, and the London University BA Examination in 1953, and entered St. Bernards Major Seminary in 1953 for his Philosophical studies.
In the seminary, he set his goals straight and charted the correct path. His perfection was to seek Gods will and fulfil it and as a result, glory and honour followed him  as the day follows the night. And the day dawned for young Nicholas Marcus to approach the altar.
Ordination and priesthood
He was sent to Collegio de Propaganda Fide in Rome in 1954 to pursue his studies and obtained Baccalaureate and Licentiate degrees in Philosophy from Urban University in Rome in 1955 and 1956 respectively, and a Baccalaureate in Theology in 1958. He was ordained a priest by His Eminence Cardinal Agagianian on December 20, 1959, in Rome. Later, he obtained his Licentiate in Theology as well from Urban University in 1960.
Fr. Nicholas Marcus returned to Sri Lanka and was appointed to the staff of St. Peters College, Bambalapitiya, in 1960. Later, he was appointed to the staff of St. Aloysius Seminary, Borella, in 1963 and was elevated as the Rector in 1965. In 1973, he was sent back to Rome to read for his Doctorate in Moral Theology which he achieved with a Summa cum Laude in 1976.
He was appointed to the staff of the National Seminary of Our Lady of Lanka in Kandy in 1976. With his elevation as the Archbishop of Colombo on March 30, 1977, by His Holiness Pope Paul VI, he became the youngest to be appointed to the office at the age of 44. He also became the first Diocesan Priest to be appointed an Archbishop.
Spiritual colossus
A scholar, preacher and spiritual colossus, Archbishop Fernando, during his 25 years as the Archbishop of Colombo from 1977 to 2002, expanded the Archdiocese in several directions. He was a spontaneous and a compelling priest, whose interests gave him new strength and greater depth.
Archbishop Fernando welcomed Pope John Paul II to Sri Lanka on January 20, 1995, for a historical visit during which the Beatification of St. Joseph Vaz took place in Colombo. He celebrated the Silver Jubilee of his Episcopal Ordination at St. Lucias Cathedral, Colombo, on May 14, 2002.
It is indeed a rare blessing and a privilege for one to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of the Priestly Ordination and His Grace thought it fit to bestow the honour to the parish that nourished him and it was befittingly celebrated with pomp and pageantry and with the participation of all the bishops and hundreds of priests at the beautiful St. Marys Church, Grand Street, Negombo, on December 20, 2009.
Archbishop Fernando is a man of utter simplicity, disarming humility and of patient holiness and piety. All along his long and distinguished religious duty spanning 59 eventful years, he endeared himself to the poor and the rich alike.
He continues to keep fit and fine and maintains a good rapport with his bishops, priests and friends, to their admiration. His entire life has been nothing short of miraculous. Archbishop Fernando was like the good and faithful servant in the parable - he was faithful in small matters, therefore, he was put in charge of great matters.
I will never forget or cease to appreciate the pivotal role he played in my life as my mentor. His grounding and counsel has stood me in good stead and given me strength to overcome many tribulations. My thoughts and prayers for him on this 86th birthday are Gods abundant blessings and good health to notch up a century.
Ad multos et faustissimos annos!

Kusal Mendis a talented cricketer
Another former Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer Kusal Mendis almost came up with a match winning performance as he has done on many occasions before. He was on the way to score a well deserved century and victory for Sri Lanka if not for that silly running between the wickets. He ran the first run too slow to start with and the England stumper noted that and pointed to the fielder to throw at the further end. For Mendis bad luck, the ball hit the wicket with a direct throw by Leach.
Until then Mendis and Roshen Silva were cruising along very well negotiating the spinners to the best of their ability. Even the bouncers sent by the English pacemen were treated dexterously hitting the occasional boundary. The pair had put on 102 runs for the sixth wicket and there was no hurry to take risks as there was one more day to go.
Mendis scored 86 runs off 129 balls and included a six and eight fours that could be described as the best performance by a Sri Lankan in the series.
Remember Mendis epic century that led Sri Lanka to victory over the strong Test team in the Australians at Pallekelle This victory gave Sri Lanka the upper hand in the Test series against the nation that were on top in Test cricket. Mendis went on to be named as the man of the match in that Test match.
Another epic knock by Mendis that can be reminisced is the match winning knock against Bangladesh in a T/20 encounter in Dhaka. Batting first Bangladesh had scored a commanding 193 for 5 in 20 overs.
It appeared a daunting task for Sri Lanka to get to the target when a total of over 160 runs is a challenging one in T/20 format.
Opening the innings Mendis showed no mercy on the Bangladesh bowlers. He smashed 53 runs off just 27 deliveries with two sixes and eight boundaries to steer Sri Lanka to a six wickets win with 20 balls to spare. Mendis was named man of the match for his epic knock.
Kusal has scored 2239 runs from 32 Test matches with the highest score being 196 runs at an average of 36.11 runs per inning. He has scored 1386 runs from 54 ODIs with the highest score being 102 runs. His 16 T/20 matches has evolved 333 runs with a highest score of 70. He has also bowled in Tests and taken just one wicket off 78 deliveries.
Mendis has lavishly contributed with the willow during his school career at Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa. His rich harvest during the 2012/13 season earned him the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award in 2013.
He became only the second Cambrian to win this award after Sahan Wijeratne who was judged as the winner in 2002.
Within a couple of years after being crowned as the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy cricketer of the year Mendis was picked to make his Test debut against the West Indies on October 2015.
Importantly, a few months later Mendis was picked to captain the Sri Lanka under-19 team for the Youth World Cup.
Kusal made his Sri Lanka ODI debut with a sparkling 51 off 59 deliveries inclusive of eight boundaries in Sri Lankas first ODI against Ireland in Dublin on June 2016. Since then, Mendis has been in the Sri Lanka team.
Mendis emergence was a blessing to the national team at a time when they were looking for a reliable top order batsman. He fitted in well after the retirement of Kumar Sangakkara at number three position.
The biggest moment in Mendis impressive Test career so far was when he scored a marathon innings of 194 runs in the first Test match against Bangladesh played in Galle.
He missed out in what would have been a dream double century that any young test batsman would like to have achieved. He fell short while attempting to reach the double with an unsuccessful attempt at six. Anyway his knock included four sixes and 19 boundaries. This masterpiece showed the qualities of a mature Test batsman though it was only his 15th Test match.
He also became only the third Sri Lankan to aggregate over 1,000 Test runs before completing 23 years of age, behind only Arjuna Ranatunga and Mahela Jayawardena.

Lankas chance to redeem themselves
Sri Lankas next three series ahead of the 2019 Cricket World Cup will give the team a chance to redeem itself from the depths its cricket has fallen into.
One thing in favour of the Lankan cricketers is that they will be playing all their matches away from home and thereby the pressure of playing on home soil and the high expectations that comes with it will not be there. They can freely concentrate on their job at hand and lift their playing levels to a point that they could be competitive enough to produce some wins which these days have become few and far between.
The 3-0 whitewash they suffered at home at the hands of England in their last Test series was a bitter pill to swallow, and now what Sri Lanka are left with is to try and compensate for those losses by winning in New Zealand which is going to be their first port of call before moving onto Australia and then South Africa.
These are not easy tours and the Lankan batsmen and bowlers are going to be tested to the maximum if they are to achieve their objective of winning.
Sri Lankas last tour to New Zealand in December 2015 ended in a 2-0 defeat where they lost the two Tests played at Dunedin and Hamilton. They were mowed down by New Zealands pace quartet of Boult, Southee, Bracewell and Wagner who exposed the batsmens weakness to counter swing more than seam.
If Lanka has learnt their lessons well from that tour they should be ready with some answers on how to counter these bowlers this time around in the two Tests scheduled at Wellington and Christchurch.
Dimuth Karunaratne, the newly appointed vice-captain, Kusal Mendis, skipper Dinesh Chandimal and Angelo Mathews all of whom form the core of the Lankan batting were all members of the side that toured New Zealand three years ago.
New Zealand would also keep in mind the Lankan batsmens weakness against spin especially in the recent series at home against England where the majority of wickets were taken by left-arm spinner Jack Leach. The Black Caps have in their line-up left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner who can prove to be an ideal foil to the seamers with his accurate deliveries that could prevent the Lankan batsmen from cashing in on him lest they are tied down by the quicks.
Suranga Lakmal, Dushmantha Chameera and Nuwan Pradeep all played in the lasts series in New Zealand and should know how to adapt to the conditions and the wickets well. On the last occasion they were guilty of bowling too short in their effort to try and find swing and were taken to the cleaners by Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Brendon McCullum and Tom Latham.
Sri Lankas record in New Zealand is not a healthy one - two wins and 10 losses in 17 attempts since 1983 which places them ahead of Bangladesh and Zimbabwe who have fared worse.
Sri Lanka can take heart from the fact that their last two overseas tours have seen them beat Bangladesh 1-0 (2 Tests) and draw the three-Test series one-all against West Indies in the Caribbean.
What the Lankan side needs is consistency in their performances which they have not been able to maintain in the past two years or so. The current crop of cricketers is the best the country can put out and they have been around for quite awhile to start producing those victories on a constant basis.
While Test cricket has to be given priority over the other two formats, all countries including Sri Lanka will also have an eye on getting the combination of their one-day sides right with the 2019 World Cup in England fast approaching.
Sri Lanka has no ODIs scheduled in Australia where they are billed to play only two Tests which leaves them with only three ODIs in New Zealand and five in South Africa in March to come up with a suitable combination that could be successful in England.
Although Sri Lanka has more or less been able to hold their own in the longer version, their ODI performances has rapidly sunk to the extent that they have remained stagnant at no.8 in the rankings for more than a year.
They have not won a bilateral ODI series since beating Ireland in 2016, a performance that summarises their decline in fifty-over cricket of which they were once masters and had other nations trying to follow and copy them.
Fielding has been a core issue in these losses and unless that is fixed they will continue to struggle as an ODI side.

Lankan Banks likely to face increased challenges on macro front-Fitch
Fitch Rating says that Sri Lankan Banks are likely to face increased challenges on the macro front.
The recent political crisis in Sri Lanka has heightened uncertainties regarding the policy outlook, with the IMF delaying discussions regarding the programme as a result. Fitch also predicts that Sri Lanka is due to enter an election cycle.
In addition, the country has large external debt-refinancing needs from 2019-2022 amid tighter global monetary conditions, with heightened domestic political instability raising refinancing risks. The resulting macroeconomic implications could dampen prospects for banks.
We believe credit risks will linger in 2019, as reflected in a rise in rescheduled loans across banks alongside a surge in NPLs in 2018. Pressures should remain manageable alongside banks increased focus, although a higher-than-expected level of loan impairments can lead to a re-assessment of these trends, Fitch stats.
Capital-raising could continue in 2019 among banks that plan to/need to strengthen capital buffers, but banks could face execution risks  given the macro instability. The impact of the implementation of SLFRS 9 is likely to be modest, and the effect on regulated capital ratios is likely to be spread out.
Fitch maintains our negative outlook, based on our expectations for operating conditions to remain difficult. Economic expansion has remained muted, and this is also likely to be the case in 2019.
Sri Lanka faces numerous additional challenges on both the domestic and external fronts, which are likely to affect banks performance through 2019, mainly on asset quality.
Fitch expects bank credit profiles to remain broadly intact, although it is possible that some modest pressure will be brought to bear on the ratings of some banks in the absence of sufficient buffers against risks. Meanwhile Fitch has a stable ratings outlook on all Asia-Pacific (APAC) emerging-market banking systems, which is unchanged from a year ago. Where Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) are underpinned by Viability Ratings (VRs), we view the banks loss-absorption buffers as generally sufficient to weather rising pressures in 2019. Around half of Fitch-rated banks in APAC emerging markets have IDRs predicated on expectations of third-party support  whether sovereign or institutional.
Some individual bank intrinsic profiles remain under pressure (such as in markets where we have a negative sector outlook), but where any rating outlooks are still stable, they would likely reflect external support and mirror that of the supporting entities.

Marked murals
The Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara is a site made hallowed by the visit of the Buddha and is one of the most sacred worshipping places of the Buddhists of Sri Lanka. In the opinion of Raven-Hart, author of 'Ceylon History in Stone', the KelaniMaha Vihara "is a sort of sample book of the buried cities, as if it is there for the convenience of visitors who are unable to visit them."
The Kelaniya Raja Maha Viharaya exemplifies the art of Buddhist murals in Sri Lanka in the eyes of the common man as well as the experts. The original paintings on the shrine walls have been added during the reign of King Voharikatissa (214 - 236 AD). In 1213, an invasion from South India led by Kalinga-Maga, resulted in the destruction of many of the shrines and temples in the island including the Kelaniya temple.
Many of you will have seen some of the paintings by the great Sri Lankan Buddhist artist, Solias Mendis. One of the most famous is the image of Bhikkhuni Sanghamitta arriving in Sri Lanka with the Bodhi tree sapling, greeting by King Devanampiyatissa.
Artist Solias Mendis, renowned the world over for his murals in the Kelaniya temple in the suburbs of Sri Lankas capital, Colombo, was a self-taught painter. Hailing from a rural village, he was an extraordinary man who shunned any form of publicity and concentrated on doing his task in a quiet way.
When authorities of the Kelaniya temple sought the advice of the famed Indian painter Nandalal Bose, he visited the temple and seeing what Solias Mendis was doing, had no hesitation is advising that Mendis should be permitted to continue with the paintings in his own inimitable style. Bose admired Mendis work and gave him a few tips to improve his style. Bose advised him that the colour of the paint to be used for a particular mural should be prepared from the clay of the same shade. He then travelled many a distance looking for the clay bearing the particular colours he needed. He succeeded in his effort and soon realised that using such clay resulted in the colour lasting for a great length of time without any discolouring.
Mendis was a young lad from an ordinary family in Kahawa, whose parents wanted to see their son emerging as an Ayurvedic physician who later in life became an excellent painter. He was born in 1895 and passed away on September 1, 1977.
At first, he studied Pali and Sanskrit but he was much interested in drawing and painting. So he gave up learning the dead languages and improved his talent in the field of arts. As years passed by he became an expert in painting Murals in Buddhist temples.
His works of aesthetic creations include some paintings in Buddhist Temples in Polonnaruwa, Attanagalla, Sedawatta and Malwana.
The wall paintings done by Salius Mendis at Kelani Raja Maha Vihara (new vihara) is the major and responsible assignment undertaken by him. The responsible task was done under the patronage of Helena Wijewardana of Sedawatta Walawwa.
Solias Mendis was sent on a study tour to Ajantha, Ellora to get inspiration for his assignment, to paint Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara Murals. Solias Mendis created a technique of wall paintings of very high calibre intermixing ingredients of Indian Buddhist paintings and ancient Sri Lankan wall paintings. He prepared his own paints using local substances such as earth and vegetables and also using some ingredients like preservatives.
He commenced painting the walls of Kelani Rajamaha Vihara at the age of 30 and he was 50 years old when he completed his assignment.
The paintings in Kelani Nava Vihara depicting Prince Danta and Princess Hemamala bringing the sacred Tooth Relic of Buddha and conferring the rank of Sanga Raja on venerable Welivita Saranankara Thera are some of his unique creations. Value of these unique, aesthetic creations cannot be expressed in words.
The master painter Solias Mendis was a philanthropist. Mahawewa Sivaraja Deaf and Blind school was built by him, funded from his life savings.
For his commended service, to show the gratitude of the nation, organizing a felicitation ceremony on his death anniversary is not unfair.

Measure for Shakespeare
All of Shakespeare's plays have terrific story-lines. Take Hamlet; a magnificent tragedy with an extremely powerful depth. The main character Hamlet finds out about his father's death, his mother's marriage to his uncle and speaks to the ghost of his late father who tells him to seek revenge on the new king (the same uncle) for his murder.
The play explores different relationships such as Hamlet's obsession with Gertrude, his mother and his love for Ophelia who he tries to convince his insanity to. Beautifully written and a must for all who have a love for literature, Hamlet is a truly gripping drama.

Miniature village for mice
Recently, photographer Simon Dell stumbled upon a family of mice running around his garden. Instead of reaching for the traps, however, he took out his tools. Dell built the mice a miniature village and they repaid him by posing in front of his camera.
I was out one day just taking photos of the birds in the garden and having just cut the grass I noticed something moving on the ground, Simon told Bored Panda.
I pointed my camera at the ground and was shocked but very happy to see a very cute little house mouse standing up just like a meerkat in the fresh cut grass. I knew instantly he was a star and ran back inside to get a couple of peanuts to put down for him. Sitting there, waiting, it was only minutes before he came back out for the treats. It was at that point I thought I would give him a little shelter and safe place to hide and feed. I had a bit of experience taking photos of wildlife and mice as I also had another mouse that used to live in my garden shed and only come out after dark. He was a wood mouse and we named him Stuart. He was once a single mouse but he left at the start of spring 2018, maybe to find a mate. Hoping he comes back this winter and maybe he could get to know the new mice in the garden, he said.
We get all kinds of wildlife in the garden. Many types of birds, such as starlings, house sparrows, blackbirds, robins, and more. Even a grey heron who has taken most of the goldfish from my ponds. We also have a fox that visits every night and a lot of hedgehogs and squirrels. At first there was just the one mouse. He had a cut in his ear and we called him George. I piled some small logs around a box as a home for the mouse and covered it with moss and straw to give him a little shelter. I could see the cats sitting just feet away at the other side of a fence so the log pile also gave him a bit more safety.
I then put up some wire fencing along the fence so there was no way the cats could get to the mouse. I also have a small Jack Russell Terrier dog so the cats know not to come in the garden and the dog pays the mice no attention, he added.
A couple of days later, I noticed there could be more than one mouse inside the log pile and it was not long till they both came out for a bit of food. I decided to build them a home as I wanted to give them a safe place in the garden and not fall prey to cats or other animals. Also, as I was feeding the mice it was the right thing to do as I would feel it was my fault getting them to come out if they became prey. Being a wildlife photographer, I wanted to create a nice looking habitat for any pictures I would take. The first stage of the log pile was very easy and only took an hour or so to make. As more mice came the following days, however, I made changes, adding more rooms. The inside of the box structure has 2 to 3 ways in and out, so they can escape if need be. Over the weeks and months, the log pile village has been steadily growing, Dell said.
I added more space and made it ready for a cold winter, giving the mice the best chance possible to survive. I have counted around 5 or more mice and the female, Mildred, is looking very pregnant so hoping we will have a large litter of baby mice around Christmas. Knowing mice can have up to 14 babies, I could be building many more log pile rooms. But I have space and dont mind living alongside such cute and very photogenic little critters, he said.
The mice seem to love the log pile homes and wasted no time in moving in. They are wild animals so they still run if I get too close or move too fast but often I manage to sit down just a few feet away with a zoom lens and they seem happy to pop in and out for nuts a seed. The food I give them is usually all natural. I pick or collect berries, nuts, and fruits that grow wild just over the road in the Shire Brook Valley Local Nature Reserve. I also give them the same mix of seeds that I put on the bird tables along with sunflower seeds and other hazel or walnuts. As a treat, I give them a couple of dry mealworms and some suet pellets but do try and stick to a natural healthy food, noted Dell.
I have always liked photography but have only owned a DSLR for around 3 years now, slowly building up my kit and upgrading cameras to improve my skills and also help get better images of wildlife. A better kit and a good lens help but nothing beats learning how to control the camera understand the settings and learn to understand the wildlife you are taking photos of. To help get closer or know where and when to find your subjects. The mice are still here and living a very happy life. It is winter now, so the days are shorter and they come out less often. Once it gets dark, it can be hard to see them. However, I see them come out in the day for food and it is always all gone by the next morning. I also give them handfuls of feathers from an old pillow and they take that to line their beds inside and keep them warm on these cold UK winter nights, e said.

MR files appeal  against CA Interim Order
Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday filed an appeal in the Supreme Court challenging the Court of Appeal Interim Order restraining him as Prime Minister until the final determination is reached with regard to the Quo Warranto writ petition filed by 122 Parliamentarians, including Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Through this appeal petition, Rajapaksa sought an order to set aside the Interim Order dated December 3 by the Court of Appeal.
He also sought an order to grant special leave to appeal against the Court of Appeal order in the writ application No.363/2018.
Rajapaksa alleged that the Court of Appeal erred in its failure to take cognizance of the absence of a proper and legally countenanced application before it in terms of the law in as much as inter alia the failure of the 122 MPs to have supported their application with affidavits countenanced by law.
He stated that the Court of Appeal erred in its failure to take due cognizance of its lack of jurisdiction to hear and determine the said writ application in which arose a number of matters involving and requiring interpretation of several constitutional provisions.
He further said the Court of Appeal erred in its failure to consider the legal effect of the cogent evidence adduced by some of 122 MPs by way of affidavits and documents, unedited Hansard issued officially by the office of Secretary General of Parliament and the video footage extracted from the official website of parliament depicting that the said uncorrected draft copies produced in court do not in fact depict accurately the parliamentary proceedings of the said date and that there were in fact no valid votes of no confidence passed in parliament as claimed by the 122 MPs.
Meanwhile, MPs Johnston Fernando, Dr. Wijeyedasa Rajapakshe, Dinesh Gunawardena and Chamal Rajapaksa also filed appeal petitions challenging Court of Appeal order dated December 3.They cited UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe and 121 MPs and 49 others as respondents.
These petitions had been filed through counsel Sanath Wijewardena.
The Court of Appeal on December 3 issued an Interim Order restraining Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, his Ministers, the State Ministers and Deputy Ministers from holding their respective offices until a final determination is reached with regard to the Quo Warranto writ petition filed by 122 Parliamentarians, including Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Court of Appeal President, Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Arjuna Obeyesekere made this order consequent to a writ petition filed by United National Party leader Ranil Wickremesinghe and 121 other Parliamentarians.

Netball nationals conducted without proper medical facilities
The second round of the Dialog National Netball Championship commenced at Ratnawaliya College Indoor Stadium in Gampaha without proper safety facilities to the players.
The Sri Lanka Netball Federation (SLNF) conducted the tournament without proper medical team and an ambulance at the venue. Usually in a game of netball a medical team and an ambulance is a must according to international rules.
When the championships commenced the president of SLNF said they were conducting the nationals according to international standards, said former national player Hyacinth Wijesinghe.
They even conducted the game between Hatton National Bank and Army SC without scoreboard. I have complained of this to the organizers but there has been no proper response. We need to consider the players safety. There are no padding in the goal posts and technical wise the tournament organizers have failed in their duty, she said.
Hyacinth pointed at the championships was sponsored by Dialog Axiata with huge sponsorship and questioned why the Federation failed to have proper goal posts with net.
In the history of netball in this country this is the first time a national is held without goal post nets. Its a shame on the officials. My question to the authorities is what has happened to money given by the sponsors Hyacinth said.
Officials she said were spending money for entertainment purposes not for netball development. Dialog came forward to support the game and develop it but SLNF officials are not utilizing the money properly, she said.
When the Daily News tried to contact the tournament organizer Champa Alwis her mobile was switched off.
Two matches were played yesterday in the second round where Hatton National Bank defeated Army SC by 58 to 41 and Air Force beat Seylan Bank 64-40.

NO TO DISINTEGRATION, YES TO REAL HARMONY
We had a semblance of unity and peace at Independence in 1948. At that time we were materially on the way to growth, prosperity and mutual acceptance of equal dignity of human persons. The solidarity that was there could have been and should have been built upon with patience, insight and wisdom. Yet we seemed to neglect attending to the three qualities of mind, heart and spirit we needed most. While the prospects of material, temporal and worldly prosperity and progress looked sound and bright - and that was part of the reason for qualifying to be granted Independence - the spiritual, the transcendent, intangible, the supernatural and other worldly or real progress was overlooked.
Human beings become more as human beings and enhance their humanity by the spiritual and supernatural qualities in their life. It is important for every organised religious or secular human community of any kind or size to be attentive to these qualities. Spiritual, supernatural and transcendent qualities that at some point become noticeable and striking are not disembodied elements existing in the air in far away space but are visible in human persons, in their thoughts, words, attitudes and actions.
Traditionally, it is religion, religious convictions and their practice that instill these spiritual and supernatural qualities in their respective adherents. However, while those who display religious devotion externally may turn out to be devoid of inner faithfulness, there are those without any adherence to any religion who show a strong moral calibre and an exemplary integrity, decency and honourableness. Political parties should not only pay lip service to these values and feign to endorse them but strongly uphold and promote them among their cadres as these qualities and values are absolutely necessary for socio-political and economic progress and to authenticate political parties themselves.
Parents inculcate right principles and right values in their children from their youngest days at home and teachers reinforce them as their charges advance in years. When parents and teachers neglect their duties, the character of children and students and their social conscience do not got formed. They could even get deformed. If these qualities are not so visible among the members of the main political parties, it means these qualities have not been strongly inculcated in them in their home upbringing and school education and discipline nor in their political party apprenticeship and initiation. Those individuals who have been accused of large-scale fraudulence and corruption and have not acquitted themselves and exonerated of guilt are the miserable miscreants of society however high they may have risen in the religious, socio-economic and political ladder.
VACUOUS RELIGIONS
Religions become stale and mildewed when the sharing of joys and sorrows, mutual aspirations of hope, visions of solidarity, the happiness of guilelessness and serenity of spiritual joy and abstentions of transgressions and misbehaviour are dried up and deadened. When the teachings of religions are not well grasped and lived in depth, religions are turned vacuous and emptied of substance and turned to meaningless rituals, heaping burdens on others and becoming even means of grabbing money and worldly power. In the lives of adherents dejection, melancholic gloom, dispiritedness and spiritual emptiness and stern unsympathetic attitudes, wicked exercise of strong arm tactics predominate. When religions seem not to inform, influence and form each individual follower of religion, but engage in buttressing the prejudices, biases, half truths and emotional tendencies that militate against human solidarity, fraternity and integration, religions get shrivelled, lose relevance and even become meaningless. Those who profess to be ensuring good care of religions do not seem to be caring of human values and human rights nor taking good care of human beings, relationships among them in the groups and in the larger community and the environment of humanity; thereby they distort and warp, misunderstand, misread and misinterpret both religions and human beings and human society. Some social and political reformers too have defaulted in the same way.
It is up to circumspective intelligent men and women to ponder and perceive whether they have understood well the core teachings of the religions and whether the following of religious precepts makes their adherents more human, better human beings, and connect them to other human beings in fraternity and spiritual solidarity or estranges from them.
RELIGIOUS VALUES AND POLITICAL CONCEIT
When the community life of the people of any land is afflicted with wide relational and socio-economic and political disparities, the bonds of human solidarity tend to breakdown and even cease to exist. The contradictions in such a society erupt in disruptions which sometimes are politically engineered for partisan purposes and due to purely personal selfishness. If a religion in such a community with inter-relational problems cannot prevent the breakdown of relationships among different people, such a religion and its authorities have lost the power of persuading people to adhere to the tenets of fraternity and loving kindness, perhaps and often because they themselves do not sustain and vindicate those values in their own lives.
Revolutions that promised to restore the dignity, rights, fraternity, equality, liberty and humanness of human beings have ended up losing control and direction resulting in annihilation, assassination and mass murders of millions of human persons. Just as spiritual and supernatural qualities in a person could influence and enhance another person and lead to common good by building a culture of loving care and compassion, aesthetic growth and mystical advancement, the character flaws and glaring deficiencies of a rebel leader could impact in a way that misleads and results in the destruction not only of individual persons and groups of human beings but also huge masses of people ending in extermination of ethnic groups and even genocide.
States based on religion-denying political ideologies even after many decades of totalitarianism, imposition of atheism by force, destruction of places of worship, persecution and unjust trials and imprisonment of religious authorities have failed to obliterate or suppress the natural religious inclinations of human beings. This has confirmed the fact that religion-denying atheistic ideologues do not have the intellectual capacity and the rationality to know what human nature is and what natural basic attractions and desires are consonant with such a nature nor the capacity for tolerance, to forebear the legitimate and non violent desires of other human beings.
GRANDIOSE SELF-IMAGE OF POLITICIANS
A predominant weakness of political leaders blighted by mediocrity is that they suffer from pretentious grandiose and imaginative ideas of themselves thinking that destiny entitles them to power and the highest possible positions and privileges irrespective of their inferior abilities and the wishes of the people who elect them. Many politicians have no idea as to how they are weighed and evaluated by the people; many are incapable of looking at the mirror of the people and seeing themselves as they are politically. The poverty of their interior dispositions do not enable them to look back at themselves humbly. Their misguided conceit prevents them from listening to good counsel. They would rather listen to those who pander to their flashy and grandiose make-believe self-images in the making. Besides these there are the self-absorbed and successful deceivers; the people need to be saved from their clutches.
BUILDING REAL HARMONY
The whole of our society is not in a satisfactory, democratic and genuinely harmonious state where there is a tangible unity in solidarity, serenity in justice and peace. That is the reason why the majority of the intelligent and right-thinking people should relentlessly exert themselves to set right not only the structures of society that need to be corrected but also convert the hearts and minds of all the people to an authentic humanness in which every human person could relate to others in unfeigned solidarity and true fraternity. It is only then that space is created for a vibrant democracy to come into existence.
Every single citizen should be helped to develop and mature himself/herself to be a responsible citizen concerned about the whole of our national society without forgetting the rest of the world for we are all citizens of it and bound with all mankind. Though they could be, not all political parties are active contributors towards that goal of making all the people good citizens. They themselves if they are engaged in politics should become unselfish citizens respectful of all other citizens without discrimination, upholding democratic values in their entirety and concerned about the common good. Everyone would be free to have ones own views and outlook on life and to persuade others of it. But it could be done keeping to mutual openness and respect. No one needs to forfeit anyones friendship or become anyones enemy on any account.
Any citizen, even a very responsible citizen, could make bona fide mistakes; but there should be no citizen so irresponsible as to do anything that causes destructive social chaos.
But if with honesty and goodwill we strive together it is possible to get every community organisation of any worth, be they religious, social, economic or political, to positively contribute to promoting just democratic, communitarian, socio-cultural, religious and human values, so that the whole of the human society is integrated and built up and humanly enhanced to make of it a truly human community of a high civilizational and cultural level with a pleasant harmony and perfect peace. If we fail in such an endeavour we would end up in inimical rivalry and inevitably disintegrate and degenerate into an abnormal and inhuman one.

Pitfalls in 5Ss and how to avoid them
After many years of experience in the manufacturing industries and successful implementation of lean practices in sixty companies, and five national Hospitals, decided to share my experiences regarding common pitfalls in 5Ss and how to avoid them.
It is with gratitude I recall the opportunities afforded to me by Japan Sri Lanka technical and Cultural Association and The Association For Overseas Technical Scholarship (AOTS ) Japan. The training in Japan and the expert guidance that helped me to enhance my own potential and make a positive contribution to improve Productivity is appreciated very much.
Collectively along with my clients we were able to raise the standard of the 5S system in Sri Lanka. Many innovative and practical solutions were found to improve the Key Performance Indicators of many companies with excellent corporate results.
Japan Sri Lanka Technical & Cultural Association (JASTECA) is conducting the annual 5S competition for 2018 and they have successfully conducted the 5S competition for the last 22 years. It is open to the Private and Public sectors and has become a much sought after competition. I thought it is the most opportune time to publish this article. JASTECA must be commended for their effort to have continuously conducting this competition without a break and to date around 1200 companies have participated.
Since incorporating M&S Associates (consultants) we successfully implemented 5S, Kaizen, Lean and several Japanese management techniques with excellent corporate results. We saw dramatic changes in production, quality, cost, delivery, safety and morale in many of these companies. They won many national and international awards.
Lesson No. 1 5S is not just housekeeping
My initial comprehension was that it is simply a method for improving organization and housekeeping. I figured that it was typically the first tool introduced in a Lean transformation because it was easy to wrap ones mind around, and was relatively safe that no persons job was impacted too drastically.
On the plus side 5S resulted in an immediate visual impact and eliminated the waste and frustration associated with employees searching for needed items. Thus, I saw it simply as a momentum builder and encourages team work.
While 5S is indeed a tool for improving workplace cleanliness, but its potential to improve key performance indicators such as production, quality, Cost, delivery, safety and morale are enormous.
In many of my presentations on 5S we have explained the need to understand the concept and the importance of relating it to ones daily activities from the time you wake up in the morning. It is a way of life and how you set the days work ahead of you at home and at work.
To fully appreciate the fundamental nature of 5S to any Lean transformation, I find it useful to start with a little arithmetic; 3S + 2S = 5S
The first three components of 5Ss are indeed about housekeeping. The fourth and the fifth Ss, however, are about establishing a culture of discipline around standard work. It is this reason that 5S is a foundational tool for all Lean transformations. Without establishing a culture that demonstrates the ability to establish standard work and sustain improvements, all future Lean progress will ultimately be a failure. In fact the Japanese lean experts believe this so strongly, that they refuse to let clients take the next step in the process until they have successfully demonstrated 5S for two years.
My own experience with many local clients is that we have allowed them to commence other Lean initiatives only on completion of 5S and good audit results exceeding 80 per cent effectiveness.
Lesson No. 2 5S is simple.......but its not easy the ideals of 5S are not complex:
Keep only what is needed at the workplace; keep it clean; store it in the most convenient location; establish clear, visual expectations for everyone to keep it in that condition; and hold people accountable to those expectations.
But lets not confuse simplicity (the lack of complexity) with ease requiring little attention or lease effort. One needs to practice with commitment and consistency. The key word here is consistency. In the incredibly competitive business environment the managers should work with a high level of consistency in order to survive and face the challenges courageously.
Likewise, what makes 5S sustainment so difficult is the consistency with which it must be applied. In short, each and every instance of nonconformity that is identified must be addressed. Anything short of that allows for doubt and mixed signals to the workforce. One company was so good at this and their weekly audits proved to be a total success. They addressed all nonconformities highlighted by the audit teams.

A factory or office successfully practicing 5Ss makes it look effortless. The successful 5S organizations are committed to constant and continuous sorting, shining and setting in order. More importantly those organizations have the courage to risk episodes of interpersonal discomfort when a team member fails to live up to agreed standards. Fortunately, all of the skills required for a flourishing 5s organization can be learned and successfully applied if the desire exists. No innate traits are required.
Like almost all things requiring discipline (healthy diet, exercise, saving) 5S is easy to understand but difficult to practice. Communication should not over simplify the challenge. Ensure the organization understands the importance and magnitude of the effort. Start small, recognize successes, and leverage to larger areas.
Lesson No. 3 5S is not an event, it is a process
Organizations often kick off their lean implementations with basic training and perhaps a short 5S Kaizen focused on the initial cleanup of a scoped area. Before and After photos are taken to document the significant change, and almost everyone leaves feeling like theyve accomplished something. Those good feelings, however, quickly erode to skepticism if the fourth and the fifth Ss are not practiced (SEIKETSU & SHITSUKE).The result is that the condition of the area steadily degrades, pulling down employees pride and enthusiasm with it. The entire Lean effort can be perceived as another program of the month.
While a 5S kaizen event is a possible trailhead for a continuous improvement Journey, great care must be taken in planning the event to ensure that all five components are adequately emphasized.Often,5S kaizen agendas allot 80-90 percent, sometimes more, of the scheduled time to sort, showcase and set in order. Standardization and sustenance are treated as afterthoughts. This reinforces the myth that 5S is only about housekeeping and sets the continuous improvement journey off on precarious first leg.
A better allotment is to spend an equal amount of time on the final two components as is spent on the first three components. Dedicated time should be assigned to document expectations. Photos of both acceptable and unacceptable levels should be included. Also ensure that fixed point photos taken before and after improvements. In addition, agreement should be reached on how team members will satisfy expectations: Will 5s time be designated each shift Does adequate time exist within machine cycles to perform the necessary tasks
An adequate portion of the agenda should also be devoted to developing the fifth S (Shitsuke). Team members must articulate their expectations of each other and practice holding each other accountable. Standard work for supervisors is recommended so that their role is clear in addressing out- of-control situations. An audit process and visual management to monitor sustainment by the team and their supervisor must be developed, including leaderships duty to hold the supervisor accountable.
Finally, an agreed - to system should be established for making improvements to the initial standards as team members identify better locations for sorting, more efficient methods for cleaning and disposal etc. Items not needed are stored in the Red Tag Corner. These items are disposed of at regular intervals.
Review 5S kaizen pre- work to ensure the appropriate time and emphasis is placed on the standardization and sustaining components. Reinforce the importance of these components in kick-off comments, during the event, and at the reporting the progress. Recognize the improvements by refraining from mission accomplished type comments. Take an active role in auditing the audits.
Lesson No.4 5S success depends almost entirely on leadership
Progressive leaders may often roll up their sleeves to help during the initial clean up or big Seiri day. In reality however, leaderships real work begins when the initial cleanup is completed.
Thats because only leadership can ensure that a culture values the standardization and sustainment within their organization. Until those values are imbedded within the workforce, pursuing other lean tools which have an even greater impact on how work is accomplished (change-over, one-piece Flow, TPM) is fruitless.
For this reason its important that all leaders, from front-line supervisors, to the senior leadership team members, understand their role in a continuous Improvement transformation. While a basic understanding of Lean principles is important, a clear image of leaderships responsibilities in the Lean environment is absolutely vital.
One manager, upon hearing of the importance of auditing for improvement Complained, I am not interested in becoming a babysitter.
One can wonder How someone in a leadership role capable of making such a remark could succeed in any organization, Lean or not. The point is, a key leadership responsibility in any setting - business, sports, charity- involves holding people accountable to the ideals and goals of the organization.
If the organization has not previously established a healthy results- oriented culture, leaders should be trained on coaching and holding employees accountable prior to embarking on 5S initiatives. Properly interacting with employees to provide feedback, both positive and negative, is the responsibility of a good leader.
Hopefully an organization eventually matures to a point where team members hold each other accountable to collectively established set of standards. This level will never be reached without leadership first modeling the behavior.
Lesson No.5 Each 5S component has a common pitfall (learn to avoid them)
My experience with 5S implementation has revealed that there are very common mistakes. By being aware of these mistakes, the prudent leader can proactively design and implementation to ensure that their organizations execution is successful.
In the SEIRI stage, companies often underestimate the critical nature of an effective, ongoing Red Tag process. Its very hard for some people to part with items they believe have value, even though that value may not pertain to the area undergoing 5S initiatives. A working Red tag process offers these people a means of getting the item out of their area, while still recycling it to a place where it can add value.
A common flaw in the initial stage is not setting a high enough standard for the team. As a result many initial stages of 5Ss end up as pure cleaning and clearing only. The objective here is to restore the area to a good as new condition and may involve painting, rearranging, aligning, restoring the floor. Leaving more space than required to store only necessary items is a frequent oversight with the set in order stage.
There is some truth which can be applied to the work area from Bostons irreversible law of clutter which states, in any household, junk accumulates to fit the space available for its storage.
In the standardization stage, I often see standards that are too vague to be useful for anyone other than the author of the standards. Clear and precise Standards should include visual examples of both acceptable and unacceptable levels of adherence.
Finally leaders make unfounded assumptions in the sustenance stage that all team members are not on board and excited to comply with the new standards of the organization. The sad truth is that some people are very comfortable living in total disarray and return to it each day after work.
Learn from others mistakes:
l Sort - develop a bullet proof Red Tag process
l Showcase - provide a clear expectation on the level of improvement desired and the appropriate budget to allow it to happen
l set in order - use creativity to minimize space which can accumulate clutter, e.g. replace a table which holds a fixture with a stand to hold the fixture
l Standardize - use someone from outside the work area to interpret standards to ensure clarity.
l Sustain - Audit from day 1 and ensure violators are held accountable including supervisors.
Lesson No. 6 5S is not important, it is essential!
The most common rationale for 5S is that an organized workplace improves Safety, quality, productivity and morale. These are good arguments, and they were enough to convince me that 5S was important, and worth doing. But now with more than 27 years experience, I know that 5S is more than important, it is essential for continuous improvement. Heres why:
Standardize and sustain are discipline dependant ideals. Its easy to sort, Showcase, and set in order, but to maintain the efficiencies that are created, People have to behave differently than they did in the past. It would be nice if behaviors would just change automatically, but it usually doesnt work that Way. It takes influence to change behaviors that have developed over time. It isnt always easy, but it can be done by leaders who have the skills and courage to do so.
So heres my point. Leaders who know how to Standardize and sustain by instilling discipline are well equipped to effectively utilize tools for continuous improvement. Why Because all lean tools are also discipline dependant. Here are a few examples:
When we create standard work we identify the best practices and document them as the standard for everyone to follow. Will they follow them just because we have created a standard Probably not. As with 5S, we have to ensure people are following the standards in order to sustain the improvements we make. Many have successfully used the SDCA cycle to ensure that the standards are adhered to. (Standardize, do, check, action)
Kanban is a fantastic tool to improve supply chain performance, but like 5S, and standard work, it requires discipline. Kanban cards must be moved at the right time and get filled in the right order for the system to work. Calculations must be regularly reviewed. These actions, while simple, are essential and require discipline.
With Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), we identify what needs to be done proactively and routinely to ensure that equipment is reliable and productive. People who are assigned TPM tasks are essential to the success of the TPM program. Their behaviors need to change after the TPM event has been completed.

Prince Mired lauds SLs efforts to be mine free
Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General promoting universalisation of the Ottawa Convention Prince Mired Bin Raad Bin Zeid Al-Hussein said he was impressed by Sri Lankas seriousness to ensure it is mine free by 2020.
He was speaking at a panel discussion chaired by Sri Lanka Permanent Representative Ambassador A. L. A. Azeez, in Geneva on November 30. Ambassadors, delegates, civil society and other volunteers participated in the Mine Free Sri Lanka 2020 event, co-organised by the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka in Geneva and the Sri Lanka Campaign to Ban Landmines.
The event took place on the sidelines of the 17th Meeting of States Parties (17 MSP) to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production, and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction.
Commending the commitment of Sri Lanka and all its implementing partners, Prince Mired lauded Sri Lankas progress, which he witnessed on a recent visit to the country, as a unique example.
Making opening remarks as the Chair of the Panel, Ambassador Azeez said, The tremendous amount of work that was done on the ground, paving the way for the release of land and the resettlement of affected persons, makes the case of Sri Lanka distinct from other situations elsewhere.
Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Northern Development Secretary V. Sivagnanasothy, making a keynote presentation, explained the strategic approach intended to make Sri Lanka mine free by 2020 and provided an outline of the remaining challenges, including risks and impacts, associated with contamination and resource constraints.
He also briefed participants on the resettlement work conducted following demining, as well as achievements made. He paid tribute to key implementing partners including the Sri Lanka Army and many other national and international organisations, as well as donors, for their support for Sri Lankas efforts towards advancing development and building sustainable peace.
A video documentary produced by the Government Information Department on Quest for a mine-free land was screened. The main activities under the Mine Action Programme including mine risk education, victim assistance, and how the returnees were rebuilding their lives remained the central focus of the documentary.
The panel included HALO representative C. Wallen, expert from MAG L. Jones, the mine action implementation partners engaged in demining in Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka Campaign to Ban Land Mines coordinator Vidya Abhayagunawardena.
Speaking on the gender dimension of mine action programme in Sri Lanka, Deputy Permanent Representative Samantha Jayasuriya said women involved in demining made difficult and risky efforts taking it beyond mere employment with the hope to see a better future for future generations. She invited continued support to empower the women affected by the conflict.
Earlier in the day, Secretary V. Sivagnanasothy presented Sri Lankas first transparency report under Article 7 of the Convention to senior officer of the UN Office of Disarmament Affairs, Peter Kolarov.
The report provides a comprehensive account on contaminated areas, destruction of mines, stockpiles, and efforts in mine risk education and victim assistance prepared through a stakeholder consultation, coordinated by National Mine Action Centre, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Northern Development Ministry, Defence Ministry and Foreign Affairs Ministry.

## Title: Sexual harassment and Afghan women's football

Sexual harassment and Afghan women's football
In post-Taliban Afghanistan, the women's football team was hailed globally as a symbol of the new freedoms enjoyed by the country's women.
But now one of Afghanistan's top sports officials has admitted that female footballers - who defied hard-liners and militants by daring to take to the field in the first place - have been sexually abused. And it's not only football - he admitted the problem extends to other sports too.
Most women athletes are too frightened to speak publicly about alleged abuse by coaches and sporting officials. But several have now disclosed privately to the BBC what they have experienced.
The scandal has exploded in the last few days. On Friday, football's governing body Fifa said it was investigating claims made by women in the national football squad. The Afghan Attorney General's Office then announced its own investigation too.
On Monday, President Ashraf Ghani addressed the allegations head on, saying they were "shocking to all Afghans".
"Even if mere allegations cause our people to stop sending their sons and daughters to sports, we need to act immediately and comprehensively," he said.
Hummel, a Danish sportswear company, has pulled sponsorship of the Afghan Football Federation (AFF), which is at the heart of the allegations.
Sayed Alireza Aqazada, the secretary general of the federation, whose president Keramuddin Karim is among the accused, repeated previous denials. The women's stories aren't true, he said. No sexual harassment had ever been carried out against any female player.
But the furore is showing no signs of abating. Questions were asked in both houses of Afghanistan's parliament on Monday. Then Hafizullah Rahimi, the head of Afghanistan's Olympic committee, made a surprising statement to reporters in Kabul.
"Sadly, these sorts of concerns have reached us," he said. "Sexual abuse does exist, not only within the Football Federation but in other sports federations as well. We have to fight it."


It's the first formal acknowledgement that persistent allegations made by former members of the women's national football team of rampant abuse by male coaches and others in positions of power may be credible.
Many of the allegations have come from Khalida Popal, a former captain of the Afghan women's national football team who also served as its programme director. She risked her life as a teenager to play football in secret - when Afghanistan was still under Taliban rule. In order not to get caught she and her friends played in silence so the Taliban guards on the other side of the school wall wouldn't hear them.
Speaking to the BBC from Denmark, where she has lived since 2011, after fleeing death threats in Afghanistan, she said she had witnessed first-hand widespread physical and sexual abuse of girls and young women by coaches and federation officials. Girls complained to her about a range of abuse, from rape to sexual touching and harassment.

She says she almost lost hope of anything being done about it after she started to document abuse by two coaches. She took her findings to the Afghan Football Federation several years ago.
"Instead of removing them or punishing them", she said, "they were promoted."
Some of the key culprits, she claims, are powerful figures in Afghanistan with close links to government. Officials in the federation would tell players that they could get them on the team list and give them money if they had sex with them, she said.
The BBC has spoken to several young women still living in Afghanistan - including some athletes from sports other than football - who tell similar stories of sexual harassment and bullying. They say the abuse often happened when they were competing to get a place in the national team or for the chance to train or play overseas. One says she was told: "Show me how beautiful you are because only beautiful girls will get on the team."

The allegations about the women's football team have particular resonance because it was earlier celebrated internationally as a symbol of a new, more liberal Afghanistan - and a showcase for the freedoms enjoyed by girls and young women after the fall of the Taliban in 2001.
The fact that the football stadium in Kabul where the team trained was once the venue for Taliban executions only emphasised the contrast.
The irony isn't lost on Khalida Popal. When she was the football team's programme director, she recruited American female coaches and many Afghan women from the diaspora. The Afghan women, she said, "dreamed of doing something for their country, of supporting their sisters back in Afghanistan, of developing a strong national team that represents a positive image of the women of Afghanistan".
"But unfortunately men tried to destroy our programme."

She says that since her allegations were published on Friday in The Guardian newspaper, she's heard from a dozen men and women who have thanked her for speaking out, some tearfully, and said they had similar experiences but were too frightened to come forward.
"I know my voice can change so many lives," she told me. "I know my voice can change the system." -- BBC News
