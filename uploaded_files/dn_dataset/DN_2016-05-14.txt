Benedictines to the fore in Athletics

St. Benedicts College displayed its ascendency in the Sri Lanka Schools Athletics scene with a brilliant all-round performance at the Colombo Zonal Athletics Championship, where the top athletes of all the leading Boys and Girls schools including International schools participated at the Sugathadasa Stadium from 3-5 May.The Benedictines totally dominated the track events and the relays, while coming up with impressive performance in the field events.
The margin of their superiority was so overwhelming that while the Benedictines amassed 202 points, the joint second placed Josephians and Peterites could muster only 58 points each. Vishaka Vidyalaya won the Girls Championship followed by Ladies College and Gateway College.The top individual performers for the Benedictines were, in the under 15 segment: Uditha Dilshan - First place in 100 meters and Long Jump and second place in 200 meters.
Promoditha Mihiranga won the 100 meters Hurdles event. Their strongest display was in the under 17 segment: Avishka Dananjaya Ratnayake coming first in the 110 Meters Hurdles and Long Jump and adjudged the Best Athlete in the segment. The Benedictines star athlete Sahan Thenuka Rajapaksha won his favourite event 100 meters with ease. In the 200 meters race Benedictines took the top three places with Lalana Madushan first, followed by Shan Thenuka Rajapaksha and Nayagara Auchitya.

Madushan also claimed first place in the 400 meters and Thilan Indrajith and Tharidu Nimesh secured first and second places in the 800 meters. Milal Nethmina Appuhamy came first in Discus Throw. In the under 19 category Sanjaya Prabash Ranaweera won first place in the 110 meters and 400 meters hurdles events. Bawantha Rangana won the 1500 meters Naveen Kavishka won the Discus Throw and Janith Eranga Seneviratne the Putt Shot event. In the under 21 category Ayesh Sandeep continued his good form winning the Javelin Throw.The Benedictines showed their clear superiority in the relays winning all the events except one in all 4 segments.
The only exception being the 4x100 meters under 19 where two of their sprinters were rested due to injuries. Captain Shiran Angelo Jeganathan, Shalika Santhush Weerasinghe, Yohan Danushka Silva joined the sprinters mentioned earlier in the relays to achieve this unprecedented feat. These performances make the Benedictines the clear favourite at the forthcoming All Island Athletics Relay Carnival to be held at the Dutagama Stadium from 24 to 27 May.The Benedictines who have excellent records especially in Football, Hockey, Basketball and Cricket, became a force in Athletics in the last decade.
The person who is mainly responsible for it is the Director of the College from 2003- 2011 Rev. Bro. Granville Perera, who took the initial steps in the mid 2000s , identifying I.D. Premasiri, one of the national coaches and appointing him as the Head Coach, to start the building up process. They had almost instant success winning the All Island School Athletic Championship in 2007. Since then SBC became a force to be reckoned with and has produced several athletes who represented the country at many International competitions including the World University Games in 2015. The hard work put in over the years brought St. Benedicts to overall No.2 spot in the Sri Lankan Schools Athletics scene in 2015. Winning the Sir John Tarbat Junior Athletics Championship, runners up at the Sir John Tarbat Senior Championship and the Western Province Athletic meet and 3rd place at the All-island Schools Athletic Meet. They ended the season convincingly winning the Saints Quadrangular Athletic Meet. The year also saw the blossoming of some outstanding young talent, like the athletes mentioned earlier and a whole host of promising juniors following in their footsteps. These youngsters have the potential to reach international standards in the next decade or so and some of them have set their eyes in representing Sri Lanka at the Olympiad 2024 and 2028.
All dreams could be realised only if the country is ready to provide them with International standard facilities and expertise. Sadly at this moment there is not a single athletic track which is fit and suitable for proper training and competition. The tracks at Diyagama and Sugathdasa are in poor condition and it is imperative that authorities act fast to arrest the situation. If not, all the enthusiasm, commitment, hard work and sacrifices of the youngsters will not produce the desired results.The Benedictines are privileged to have a member of the staff Nuwan Abeywickrama, a past SBC athlete, who has represented the country at International competitions as their Master in Charge and Junior coach. He is such a meticulous planner and organizer, that one could see him in complete control all the time. Head Coach I D Premasiri who is probably Sri Lankas best sprint coach has worked very hard with much dedication to nurture these youngsters who start training at 11 years of age.
Practices start at 6am sharp daily and also on weekends, when necessary. The athletic squad of SBC now numbering 80 also have the services of a Throwing coach Jeewantha Prasad, a Jumping coach Saman Kumara and a physio Marin Amerasinghe who also plays an important role towards the success of the team.The hallmark of the Benedictine athletic squad is its discipline, team work and the excellent work ethics.
It is stressed into them that athletics at SBC is not just an individual sport but also a team sport because they represent the school as a team.
The Director of the College Rev. Bro. Henry Dissanayake always impresses on the youngsters that one competes to bring glory and honour to the individual and pride and recognition to the school he represents.
The person behind all this and one who ensures that Team SBC performs to its full potential is none other than the unassuming, dedicated, selfless sports co-ordinator young Brother Pravin Vaz who is indeed an asset to St. Benedicts College and the Lasallian Brothers.

England call up uncapped Vince and Ball for Lanka Test

Uncapped duo James Vince and Jake Ball have been named in Englands 12-man squad for the first Test against Sri Lanka at Headingley next week.
Vince, 25, looks set to play in the game, which starts on 19 May, while Ball, also 25, will have to vie for the third seamers role in Leeds.
Alex Hales remains as captain Alastair Cooks opening partner, while pace bowler Steven Finn is fit again.
Nick Compton has kept his spot as Englands likely number three. Lions captain Vince has five limited-overs caps and was part of the England squad that reached the final of the ICC World Twenty20 in India last month.
He comes into the team in place of the retired James Taylor. Its something Ive been aiming for since I was a little kid really, said Hampshire captain Vince.
Definitely when I was growing up, playing for England in a Test was still the number one. Vince gets the nod at number five ahead of the likes of Ian Bell and Gary Ballance, who were both dropped last year. Gary Ballance is still a fine player, said England vice-captain and Ballances Yorkshire team-mate Joe Root. Im sure when he gets the opportunity to play for Yorkshire next week hell be desperate to prove hes still a Test batsman.
Root, speaking to BBC Sport, added: James has had a fantastic start to the season, he has been involved in the England set-up all winter and proven that hes got the right temperament and mindset to be successful on the international stage. Ball has stated his case with 19 wickets already for Nottinghamshire this season and also spent time with the Lions in the United Arab Emirates.
The right-armer will compete with Steven Finn for a place in the final XI.
Ive never met the coach Trevor Bayliss and I dont know if hes seen me bowl in person, Ball told BBC Radio 5 live. Ill have to try to impress him and Alastair Cook in the nets and hopefully that we lead to a spot in the team.
Im not putting pressure on myself. Ill just enjoy every minute of it because its a once in a lifetime experience and keep doing what Ive been doing for Notts. There are three Tests in the series, with the second set for 27 May at Chester-le-Street and the third from 3 June at Lords.
Squad: Alastair Cook (captain), Moeen Ali, James Anderson, Jonny Bairstow, Jake Ball, Stuart Broad, Nick Compton, Steven Finn, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Ben Stokes, James Vince.

Cozier joins formidable squad up in the celestial commentary box

Down on the beach, the pitch was gathering pace as the sand dried in the Caribbean heat.
Taking guard, the batsman noticed both men saving the single on the off-side were waist-high in the surf. A third, chortling behind the stumps, seemed to know what was coming next. Off his Sunday league run, former Pakistan Test bowler Sikhander Bakht didnt bother with any kiss-the-surface nonsense, nor with back-of-a-length aiming for the top of off-stump.
It was a full bunger, head-high, and although the hapless striker tried to hook it off his nose, the tennis ball smacked him right between the eyes.
The gallery of spectators looking down from the garden of Tony Coziers beach house, on the windward coast of Barbados, roared with laughter as your correspondent was sconned by an international cricketer for the first time.
Cozier later offered the befuddled hack another bottle of beer from the cool box, a fish cutter (the islands signature snack) and a word of sage advice: Never hook when the tides going out.
On cricket tours of the Caribbean, Coziers beach party was always the best day of all  because he was as genial a host as he was in the commentary box.
When the West Indies were putting England to the sword in the 1980s with consecutive Blackwash wipeouts, Coziers soundtrack on the radio was warm and soothing  like a doctors kind words as he cased your broken arm in plaster.
If you needed to know anything about West Indies cricket, Coziers was the first name you wanted on speed dial.
He was as proud of the island confederation dominating world cricket for 20 years towards the end of the 20 century as he was dismayed by its decline at Test level, although it would have warmed his heart to see the Windies win the World Twenty20 in such dramatic fashion six weeks ago.
Tony Cozier died on Wednesday in Barbados at the age of 75, and up in the celestial commentary box they are forming a formidable squad.
When rain stops play upstairs, Benaud, Martin-Jenkins, Greig and Cozier  to name just a few revered voices of cricket to fall silent in recent years  will be the million-dollar eavesdrop on Test Match Special. MIRROR

Serena Williams ill after eating dog food before win

Serena Williams made herself ill after eating dog food hours before reaching the last eight of the Italian Open.
The world number one tried a spoonful of food meant for her dog, Chip, before beating fellow American Christina McHale in straight sets in Rome.
I thought what the heck, I'm gonna try a piece, it looks good, she said.
Fast forward two hours, I just ran to the toilet like I thought I was going to pass out. It did taste weird. It tasted kind of like house cleaner.
In a video posted on Snapchat, Williams explained she sampled a dish of chicken and rice offered on a doggy menu at her hotel. I force-swallowed it, said the 34-year-old American. I don't know what they put in these dog foods, but Chip liked it.
I don't think it's consumable for humans. They should have wrote that! So now I feel really sick. It was just a spoonful, but I don't feel so good.
Williams defeated McHale 7-6 (9-7) 6-1 and set up a meeting with Svetlana Kuznetsova, who beat fellow Russian Daria Gavrilova, in the last eight.
Elsewhere, British number one Johanna Konta was beaten in three sets by Misaki Doi in the third round.
Konta, 24, took the opening set but went down 4-6 7-5 6-2 to her 25-year-old Japanese opponent.
Doi, ranked 45 in the world, belied her position 22 places below the Australian Open semi-finalist to take victory.
Doi faces Swiss Timea Bacsinszky in the last eight.
Despite her defeat, Konta will arrive at the French Open as a seeded player. A year on from being ranked 143rd in the world, she is up to 23.
I thought she played a very, very good level today and I didn't do quite enough to get her out of her comfort zone, Konta told BBC Sport.

Olympic champ Merritt reveals second kidney op

SHANGHAI, FRIDAY: Olympic hurdles champion Aries Merritt revealed on Friday that he needed a second operation for kidney trouble and said he was months behind in his preparations for the Rio Games.
The 30-year-old American underwent a kidney transplant in September but he said he then needed a second procedure after complications developed.
The latest details about Merritt's condition raise questions about his ability to mount a successful Olympic title defence. He said he still suffers discomfort when he trains and competes.
About seven weeks later, I actually had a second surgery that many people don't know about, Merritt told journalists ahead of the Shanghai Diamond League.
I had one complication which caused me to have to go back in and have another operation... I was having difficulty with haematoma that had developed that was actually crushing the kidney.
Merritt was back training in by January but he said his preparations were way behind those of his rivals. He finished sixth in the 110 metres hurdles at this month's Doha Diamond League.
It is a struggle, but it's not because over time it will get better and better. But I don't want to make any excuses because I'm lining up with everyone else, Merritt said.

Tennis Australia back bad boy Kyrgios ahead of Rio Games

SYDNEY, FRIDAY: Tennis Australia on Friday backed controversial star Nick Kyrgios ahead of his mooted selection in Australia's team for this year's Rio Olympics.
The backing of TA President Steve Healy for the polarising Kyrgios comes after Bernard Tomic announced on Friday that he would not be available for selection for the Olympics, citing his busy playing schedule.
Australia's Olympic chef de mission Kitty Chiller has warned TA that bad behaviour will not be tolerated in Rio.
But Australia's tennis chief Healy came out in support of Kyrgios as the organisation mount a case for his selection in Australia's tennis team for the Rio Olympics.
Since the disciplinary action taken against Nick last year he's made a concerted effort to improve his performance and behaviour, and full credit to him, Healy said in a statement.
Its unfortunate that he's been included unfairly in recent discussions on player behaviour that have not involved him.
His performances this year have been markedly improved and its obvious hes showing more maturity. Only world No.1 Novak Djokovic has beaten more top 10 players than Nick this year.
Nick deserves the opportunity to concentrate on his tennis without any additional distractions.
Kyrgios, 21, the world number 20, has frequently been under fire in the past for his behaviour both on and off the court.
He infamously made crude remarks last year about the girlfriend of Swiss ace Stan Wawrinka and was given a suspended 28-day ban and fined US$25,000.
Chiller has made it known that Tomic and Kyrgios were under scrutiny for their behaviour ahead of finalising Australia's team for Rio.
I would be appalled. I would be embarrassed as a leader of the team if any of our Olympians behaved with disrespect, Chiller told reporters Friday after news of Tomic's unavailability.
Kyrgios took to social media, referring to the team boss as that Kitty Chiller and all but daring selectors to overlook him for Rio at a recent post-match media conference.
We have had nothing official except for some ill advised, shall I say, comments about me and what it means to be an Olympian, Chiller said of Kyrgios's latest response.
I think some of Nick's comments in social media have shown that maybe he doesn't understand what it means to be an Australian Olympian.
It is not just about winning on the court - it's about how you go about it. - AFP

29th L. E. Blaze Trophy today :Wesley firm favourites against dejected Kingswood

Wesley College and Kingswood College Kandy are yet again set to battle it out for their power in rugby when they play their annual inter-school encounter for the coveted L.E. Blaze trophy on Saturday 14 May, at the Royal Sports Complex. Kick off will be at 4.30pm.
In honour of this great gentleman Blaze, brother schools Kingwood and Wesley set out to play an annual encounter of rugby which consists of two legs each hosted by the schools in Kandy and Colombo.
The first L.E. Blaze Trophy game was played on 17 July 1986. The game was won by Kingswood that year. Kingswood was captained by Ronnie Ibrahim and Wesley by Sumedha Kuruppu. In the history of the L.E. Blaze Trophy out of 28 encounters, Kingswood has won 20 and Wesley has won five while three games have ended in draws.
This year, Wesley is captained fourth year coloursman, prop forward Zayan Sabar and coached by former Thomian Jeewan Goonethilaka. Wesley commands the No. 4 position in the Singer Schools rugby league 2016, Division 1 Group A points table so far having registered victories against St. Josephs College and D.S. Senanayaka College respectively.
Kingswood is captained by third year coloursman centre three quarter Sachintha Udagalahitiyawa and coached by newly appointed ex-Kingswood old boy Mothilal Jayathilake.
So far Kingswood has failed to win a single game thus losing to all the schools they have confronted and hence currently occupy the last slot at number six position in the Singer Schools rugby league 2016 Division 1 group B points table.
The game is tipped to be an exciting 80 minutes display of rugby, with both schools playing for glory in this annual encounter.

Shun DMK-Congress front, vote for me, says Jayalalithaa


Reviving the Sri Lankan Tamils issue at the close of Assembly election campaign, Chief Minister and AIADMK general secretary, J. Jayalalithaa, on Friday warned that the DMK-Congress alliance would pose a `great danger to efforts of island Tamils fighting to retrieve their rights.

In an indirect reference to the alliance, she said the political alliance described as Kooda Natpu (bad company) was responsible for the massacre of lakhs of island Tamils. The alliance which separated had joined hands together with the new description of Otti pirandhavargal (born together), she said in an apparent reference to the remarks of DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin that DMK and Congress were twins who could not be separated.

In an open letter to party cadres, she hit out at the family politics of DMK and asked the party cadre to remind voters about the previous DMK rule when newspapers, radio, television channels, film production and distribution, besides right to conduct cricket matches went to the control of a single family.

Jayalalithaa said If the poisonous tree of family politics strengthens its roots, it will be perilous to individual freedom. During DMK rule from 2006-2011, ruling party functionaries grabbed land and other property of people, she said and added that people would not have forgotten the incidents. The DMK is using the huge money it earned through scams like 2G and indulging in a propaganda through newspapers and other media, in a bid to erase from peoples mind, the historical blunders and crimes committed by the party. She asked the party cadre to defeat the propaganda tactics of the family members of the evil force through tireless work. She sought votes for performance of her government. (deccanchronicle)
