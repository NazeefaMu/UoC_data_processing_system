Army Commander highlights importance of Civil-Military partnership
Student Officers reading for the Passed Staff College (PSC) degree at the Defence Services Command and Staff College (DSCSC) at Sapugaskanda on November 7 as has been the customary practice at the DSCSC were privileged to listen to the formal address of Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, at the DSCSC auditorium.
The lecture, themed on Unity of Effort Building Civil-Military Partnership to Counter Violent Extremism dwelt on a wide range of issues that were associated with the birth of violent extremism, its gradual expansion and measures needed to be adopted to avoid recurrence of violence. The programme was largely meant to motivate tri-service student Officers at the
DSCSC, now affiliated to the University of Kelaniya as a degree awarding institute.
In his address, the Commander specifically covered notions of radicalization, violent extremism, de-radicalization, civil-military partnerships to respond to radicalization and the Sri Lankan perspective in addressing such concerns. He maintained that the need of the hour was to assist the governments ongoing reconciliation process, through which the Army too could contribute by building civil-military partnerships, which is essential and important to counter violent extremism and sustain hard-earned peace. This could be more practical if the Army too would follow the engagement and assistance policy for this civil-military partnerships in todays context, he underlined.
Radicalization always has tendency to give birth to violent extremism and later into terrorism. The reasons that would lead to radicalization are diverse and forms of violent extremism would definitely develop into terrorism unless we arrest its behaviour and levels of intensity. Engaging the society through dialogue and understanding whilst providing assistance are the key factors to reduce the appeal of extremism and to provide possible alternatives and this has been amply exhibited right throughout after the Sri Lankan conflict was over. Rehabilitation, Reconstruction, Reintegration, Resettlement and Reconciliation, more popularly known as the 5R concept, the
Commander said, would help build up the bridge to strengthen civil-military partnership.
After addressing the students, the Commander kept the floor open for questions of the attendees and answered a considerable numbers of queries, put forward to him in an amicable manner.
Commandant DSCSC Major General Ruwan Kulathunga, welcomed the Army Commander on arrival and invited him to deliver the lecture after giving an introductory speech. Similarly, the Commander during his stay in the premises mingled with student Officers and shared a couple of thoughts with them. Before his departure, Lieutenant General Senanayake was invited to leave his memories in the Visitors Book.
Lieutenant General Senanayake also presented a memento to the DSCSC Commandant as a token of appreciation of the DSCSC services. The gesture was reciprocated. Students of the DSCSC course No 11, together with foreign students, permanent staff and the academic staff also listened to the Commanders formal annual address at the DSCSC.

Ashes born as Spofforth slays England, 1882
[Continuing our series]
If Fred Spofforth, demon bowler, egg-thrower and tea salesman extraordinaire, ascended to cricketing immortality at The Oval in August 1882, he started his climb across London at Lords in May 1878. It was a remarkable match between the touring Australians and an MCC team strong enough to be an England side in all but name, in which a batsman strode to the crease 37 times, and on three occasions they stuck around long enough to reach double figures; on average, each man scored 2.8.
In their first innings, the MCC managed to slip from 27 for two to 33 all out, with Spofforth claiming six wickets, including a hat-trick, while conceding just four runs. In their second they were skittled out for 19, with four more wickets for Spofforth, including that of WG Grace, bowled for a duck with the second ball of the innings.
He finished the match with 10 wickets, while Harry Boyle, who was also to make a key contribution in 1882, took nine. At the end of the day Spofforth is said to have wheeled around the dressing room chanting: Aint I a demon Aint I a demon Many agreed that he was, and he was thenceforth known as The Demon.
Spofforth varies his pace in the most remarkable way, wrote the Guardian the following day, at one time sending down a tremendously fast ball and at another almost a slow one. It was his ability to produce massive variations in pace, despite swinging his bowling arm at apparently identical speeds, that most befuddled batsmen. Variation, Spofforth wrote, is only any use if you learn to hide it. The sole object in variation is to make the batsman think the ball is faster or slower than it really is.
He had a different grip of the ball for each of the three paces he bowled, his future international team-mate John Trumble was to recall, and it must have necessitated for him very strenuous practice to secure accuracy with the grip he had for his very slow ball. But he could do many remarkable things with his hands, even throwing a new-laid egg a distance of 50 yards or so on turf and causing it to fall without breaking.
His pace was terrifically fast, at times his length excellent, and his breakbacks were exceedingly deceptive, Grace wrote. He controlled the ball with masterly skill and, if the wicket helped him ever so little, was almost unplayable. A good many batsmen funked Spofforths bowling and a great many found it impossible to score off him.
The following year Australia beat an England side in Melbourne, Spofforth taking 13 wickets, including the first ever Test hat-trick. One witness wrote of his catherine-wheel action, rare command of pace and break and Mephistophelian cast of countenance. Tall and thin, he liked to meet incoming batsmen with a malevolent glare. His entry in Sport Australias hall of fame notes that his swarthy complexion, black moustache and steely brown eyes combined to convey the unmistakable aura of hostility. I verily believe, another team-mate, George Giffen, later wrote, he has frightened more batsmen out than many bowlers have fairly and squarely beaten.
Billy Barnes, of Notts and England, once described playing against Spofforth. I were in right form and not afeard of him when I goes in to bat, he said. I walks into th middle jaunty-like, flickin my bat. As I got near Mr Spofforth he sort of fixed me. His look went through me like a red-hot poker. I walks on past him along th wicket to th batting end, and halfway down somethin made me turn round and look at him over my shoulder. And there he was, still fixin me with his eye. Spofforth was no bowler; he were a hypnotist, and ought in all fair sport to have been made to bowl in smoked specs.
Spofforth, a distant relative of Britains double Olympian and 100m backstroke world record-holder Gemma, contributed a fascinating chapter on bowling to CB Frys seminal 1906 book Great Bowlers and Fielders: Their Methods at a Glance (its better than it sounds). In it he spells out the value of hard work  at the time of writing there is hardly one first-class amateur bowler in England, and in my opinion laziness is one of the main causes of this  and constant hostility. Always attack the batsman, he wrote. Bear in mind that batsmen are sometimes nervous creatures, whose first object is to score one run and then 10, and it is during this period you have your chance. Go for him for all you are worth and dont let him get the pace of the wicket by bowling fast and outside the stumps.
Spofforth did suffer from periods of poor form, and a spell out of the game entirely after being thrown off a horse, between that match in 1879 and him boarding the SS Assam in Melbourne on 15 March 1882 with the rest of Australias touring party.
Their journey took the best part of two months, but the tourists seemed anything but indisposed after their arrival in Plymouth on 3 May. For a start, some fool on board had bet George Bonner, the 6ft 6in all-rounder once described as a giant of strength and an Apollo of grace and widely known as The Australian Hercules, that once ashore he couldnt throw a cricket ball 110 yards without a warm-up. Bonner stepped off the boat and launched one 119 yards from a standing start, earning 100  10,200 in todays money  in the process. It was the first of many Australian successes that summer, and by the start of their one Test they had won 24 of 28 matches.
The Guardian considered the first day the most considerable disaster of their visit. It certainly featured their lowest score, 63, with Englands George Ulyatt, known as Happy Jack on account of his habit of merrily whistling at all times, the least economical England bowler  his nine overs (which lasted four balls each at the time) went for 11 runs.
Englands team included another fellow known for being merry, though in a different sense, in the shape of Billy Barnes, once reprimanded by Nottinghamshire, despite hitting a century against Middlesex, because he had turned up at Lords late, and obviously drunk. Beggin your lordships pardons, he told his clubs committee, if ah can go down to Lords and get drunk and mek a century fore lunch, then ah thinks it ud pay tNotts committee to get me drunk afore every match.
Keeping wicket was Alfred Lyttleton, who despite being only 25 at the time was already an MP for the Liberal Unionists, and had played football for England (and scored) against Scotland the previous year. When Australia returned to The Oval in 1884, their first-innings score ticked past 500 and, in their desperation to find a breakthrough, every single member of the England team tried their hand at bowling. Lyttleton, bowling underarm and with his wicketkeeping pads still strapped to his legs, took the final four wickets.
Englands reply started at 3.30pm in rapidly-failing light, and after a flicker of promise as Happy Jack Ulyett and Alfred Bunny Lucas put on 39 for the third wicket, went rapidly downhill with the loss of five wickets for 13 runs.
The change that had come over the game was a keen disappointment to the spectators, who were very quiet as the English batsmen went down one by one before the Colonists splendid bowling, we reported. Though Englands total of 101 was scarcely impressive, it did give them a 38-run lead.
The second day started, after a rain delay, with the Australian opener Hugh Massie scoring 55 runs off 60 balls in 57 minutes, an innings entirely out of keeping with the rest of the match (though he should have been caught by Lucas at long-off for 38). But more memorable was the dismissal of Sammy Jones, who hit Grace to point and took an easy single, grounded his bat at the other end and then turned to pat down a bump in the pitch. Lyttleton threw the ball to Grace, who removed the bails and appealed for a run-out. Bob Thoms, the pre-eminent umpire of his age, raised his finger. Spofforth, next man in for Australia, was utterly incensed, while at the other end his great friend, New South Wales team-mate and international captain Billy Murdoch (Spofforth had turned down a place in Australias team for the first ever Test, against England the previous year, because Murdoch hadnt been invited), was equally unimpressed.
According to John Millers history of the Ashes, Spofforth asked his captain: What do you think of what happened to young Jones It wasnt the most courteous piece of sportsmanship Ive seen, Fred, replied Murdoch. At which the incandescent bowler said: I swear to you, England will not win this. Within 10 minutes Australias innings was over for 122, and back in the dressing room he roared at his team-mates: This thing can be done!
When the England innings opened with only 85 runs to win, nothing seemed more certain than that the Colonials would suffer a crushing defeat, we reported. And though Spofforth bowled Hornby, Englands captain at both cricket and rugby union, and his Lancashire team-mate Dick Barlow with successive balls with the score on 15, Grace and Ulyett then put on 36 for the third wicket.
After the stand made by Mr Grace and Ulyett, the betting was at enormous odds, we wrote. The crowd, numbering upwards of 20,000 persons, was wrought up to a pitch of intense excitement and every hit was enthusiastically cheered. The Australians, however, never bated a jot of hope and courage.
The strain, even for the spectators, was so severe that one onlooker dropped down dead, and another with his teeth gnawed pieces out of the top of his umbrella, wrote Tom Horan, the Australian batsman, of the games final moments. For the final half-hour you could have heard a pin drop. That was the match in which the last English batsmen had to screw his courage to the sticking place by the aid of champagne, when one mans lips were ashen grey, and his throat so parched that he could hardly speak as he strode by me to the crease. That was a match worth playing in, and I doubt whether there will ever be such another game for prolonged and terribly trying tension.
Next man in was the celebrated all-rounder Allan Steel, who played his first two balls from Spofforth as clumsily as a novice and then got out to the third. Two balls later Maurice Read was bowled, and England were 70 for seven. With his dismissal a change came over the scene, we wrote. Whilst the Colonists could not help betraying their glee, the spectators became downcast and silent. Lucas, having faced 55 balls and scored just five runs, played on to his wicket to become Spofforths 14th victim of the match (his last 11 overs cost just two runs and brought four wickets, including for the first time a run of three in four Test balls). Irresistible as an avalanche, Giffen wrote. The finest piece of bowling I have ever seen. Boyle took the final two wickets in the following over. England were all out for 77, and Australia had won by seven runs  a fitting reward, we reported, for their superb bowling and fielding and their remarkable pluck.
It was Englands first ever defeat on home soil, a match that would have been famous enough even if Reginald Shirley Brooks, who was to die six years later aged just 33 after a brief but memorable life of intense carousing, hadnt placed a mock obituary in the following weeks Sporting Times mourning the death of English cricket and promising that the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia.
An England team set sail on a revenge mission just 12 days later, with the touring captain, Ivo Bligh, pledging before his departure to beard the kangaroo in his den and try to recover those ashes, and a legend was born. While in Australia, Bligh was presented with a small terracotta urn, which was to become rather famous.
As for Spofforth, he wasnt done with England yet. He returned in 1884 for a three-Test series, a tour which ended with his marriage to Phyllis Cadman, a local woman, at All Saints Church in Broadsall, Derbyshire. Phyllis failed to settle in Australia, and in 1887 they moved back to England. He turned out for Derbyshire for a while  where in addition to his playing achievements he memorably, through forensic examination of the clubs accounts, identified the former county captain turned secretary, Samuel Richardson, as the man behind the embezzlement of some 1,000 (Richardson, in an unpredictable twist, fled to Spain, changed his name and became court tailor to King Alfonso XIII).
Spofforth eventually took over his wifes family business, the Star Tea Company, with considerable success  he was to leave an estate valued at 169,258, the equivalent of 8.8m today.
When he died in June 1926, the flags at Lords were flown at half-mast, and the former England captain Archie MacLaren was among those who helped to unload two carloads of wreaths at his funeral. We shall not look upon his like again, no doubt, Neville Cardus wrote in this newspaper, at which sentiment all honest batsmen will say: What a soothing reflection is that!"  theguardian

Brussels loses Euro 2020 matches to Wembley
Nyon: Wembley Stadium in London will host four Euro 2020 matches originally set to be staged in Brussels, UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said on Thursday.
Brussels had been one of 13 venues picked to host this unique edition of the European Championship -- to celebrate the tournament's 60th anniversary -- held across the continent rather than in a single host country.
But the European football governing body's executive committee decided "unanimously" to strip Brussels of its four matches due to the inability of Belgian organisers to guarantee the new stadium where they would have been held could be built in time.
Wembley will now host seven matches in total, having already been allocated the two semi-finals and the final on July 12, 2020.
UEFA also announced the opening game on June 12, 2020, would be held at Rome's Stadio Olimpico.
"Due to the Eurostadium project's failure to meet the conditions imposed by the UEFA Executive Committee during its meeting of 20 September 2017, the four matches (three group, one round of 16) initially scheduled to be held in Brussels will now be allocated to London's Wembley Stadium following a vote by the committee," said Ceferin.
"We discussed with Brussels for quite a long time, they were not able to provide us with all the documentation.
"Until today we don't know if they can build a stadium or not.
"They still don't have the documents. They had time until today's executive committee (meeting) and they didn't do it.
"We received a letter yesterday that 31st of January there will be a final decision but the decision -- yes or no -- they don't know.
"Experts from administration had the opinion it was a high risk for UEFA if we wait."
The company contracted to build the stadium in the northern suburb of Grimbergen, BTP Ghelamco, said they were able to build the 60,000-capacity Eurostadium in 18 months, but the Flanders region in which it will be situated has yet to issue a building permit.
"Right up until the last moment we did the utmost to try to get an extra delay from UEFA, but we respect their decision," said the Belgian federation in a statement.
However they said UEFA's decision "does not necessarily signify the end of the stadium project".
"We absolutely need a new 45,000-capacity stadium and we hope the competent ministers grant the permit in January so that a stadium fit for the 21st century can finally be built in our country," said federation president Gerard Linard.
Brussels has hoped to construct a new stadium ever since the Heysel stadium disaster, when 39 people died before the start of the 1985 European Cup final between Juventus and Liverpool.
A refurbished Heysel, called the King Baudouin Stadium, staged matches at Euro 2000, which Belgium co-hosted with the Netherlands.
A draw was also held on Thursday to decide which cities would host games from the various groups.

Migratory birds, flamingos, will flock at the Bundala National Sanctuary during the oncoming season, the Bundala Park Warden said.
He said flamingos arrive at Bundala from Siberia. About 10 years ago, thousands of flamingos used to come there, but in 2014 none came, he said.
Bundala is now in jeopardy due to unruly human activities. He said prolonged droughts dried up reservoirs, streams, and lagoons in the Bundala wetlands.

Kohlis first-innings knock of 243 was followed with 50 as he finished with 610 runs in the series, which India won 1-0. Kohli, who slammed back-to-back double-centuries and recorded three-figure scores in three consecutive matches, started the series in sixth position but has leapfrogged David Warner, Cheteshwar Pujara, Kane Williamson and Joe Root after the stupendous run which saw him average 152.50.
Though 45 points separate him from Australia captain Steve Smith, Kohli would be eyeing the chance of reaching the zenith in all three formats since he is the current No. 1 in ODIs and T20Is. Smith though has been in a different league and last week reached 941 points, the joint fifth-highest in terms of the highest points tally in batting history in Tests. Smith is now on 938 points while Kohli is on 893 points.
Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting is the only batsman to have been at the top in all three formats at the same time  in December-January 2005-06, while his compatriot Matthew Hayden is the other batsman to have topped all three formats.
In the MRF Tyres ICC Test Team Rankings, India has lost one point but remains well ahead of South Africa at the top of the rankings, while Sri Lanka remains on its pre-series tally of 94 points in sixth place.

COPA scans EPF losses
A number of investments made by the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) in 2010 and 2013 which resulted in impairment losses of Rs 6.3 billion was questioned by the Committee of Public Accounts (COPA).
The latest COPA report tabled in Parliament yesterday revealed that the EPF had made an investment of Rs.500 million in SriLankan Airlines in July 2010, another investment of Rs. 810 million in a hotel company in May 2010, and another investment of Rs. 5 billion in a new hotel complex at the end of 2013, but those failed to make any profitable gains to the Fund.
The said amounts had been written off as impairment losses in the financial statements. The EPF authorities had told the Committee that Cabinet approval has been granted to restructure the activities related to the Fund.
The report also stated that Rs 2.5 billion and Rs 5.2 billion worth of investments were written off in 2015 and 2016 respectively as losses.
The EPF authorities had been directed to formulate and submit a comprehensive report on those write offs clearly categorizing them as complete losses and losses incurred as a result of impairment.
Having observed the deficiencies in investments made by the Fund, the Committee directed the authorities to conduct a feasibility study before deciding on any investment in future and to establish a transparent and standardized methodology for that purpose, the report stated.
The COPA requesting the details on investments made by the EPF has asked for the investigation report of the Central Bank Monetary Board in that regard. It has also queried on the investment of Unit Trusts by the EPF during a period of seven years from January 2010  December 2016.
The report also stated that the EPF in 2016 had purchased a lesser volume of bonds from the primary market which has a higher yield, while a greater volume of bonds had been purchased from the secondary market which has a lesser yield, depriving the members of the Fund a massive financial gain.
The Central Bank Governor had told the Committee that an internal investigation is being carried out on the purchase of bonds by the EPF in 2016.
With regard to the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the report also highlighted that over Rs 310 million remained unsettled for travelling expenses, rent advances and other advances with relevance to foreign missions. The Ministry Secretary had told the Committee that the attention had been paid to appoint a committee to investigate in that regard and issue a circular through the Foreign Administration Unit.
With reference to the National Museums Department, the report has highlighted that no proper procedure has been implemented to date to ensure the protection of antiquities since the robbery t that took place in 2012. Despite the lapse of a period of five years since that robbery, no action has been taken so far to properly install a security camera system. Existing CCTV system has a number of weaknesses such as the inability to capture scenes in the dark. It has been defunct by the time the robbery happened.
The report contained the findings on 36 institutions probed during the period from January to May 2017.

Yan Oya Reservoir Project
Delay in resettlement causes uproar
Delay in resettling nearly 300 families affected by the Yan Oya reservoir resulted in unrest among the people in the area.
They are waiting to rebuild their lives, but they say the proposed land for resettlement was not suitable for the purpose according to the environment impact evaluation report.
Therefore, alternative lands were selected with the approval of the Forest Conservation Department and reports were submitted to the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) for approval, they said.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake said the delay in providing the approval by the CEA for the areas earmarked to resettle the people worsens the situation.
He said the Yan Oya Project Management, therefore, has taken steps to resettle the families in the proposed areas with the verbal approval of the FCD.
The FCD has granted approval only to remove the shrub jungle for resettlement and not to fell trees since the Forest Department has not approved the felling trees.
The Central Environmental Authority has to follow a long procedure before it approves deforestation in the area. This in turn hinders resettlement procedures. Providing electricity, drinking water, sanitation and common amenities for resettling people were extremely delayed as a result and the affected people have taken the issues with project officials, Wannianayake said. Nearly 4,000 hectares were acquired for the Yan Oya project and the government spent Rs. 35,000 million on the construction.
The Chinese CAMC company was entrusted the construction of the 3 km-long main dam and they have completed their task before a year from the scheduled time.
Filling the reservoir and supplying water to cultivate 20,000 hectares under the reservoir is yet to be done. "If it is not finished on time, a huge compensation has to be paid to the Chinese company according to the agreement reached by the two countries.
"I have already appraised the Secretary of the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry the situation," Wanninayake said.

Democratic constitution, a dire need
We are discussing the past to bring an acceptable solution to the Lankan Tamil National problem. There is an open atmosphere to come out with what you think, particularly about what happened in the past. We have to stop the tragedy of war repeating; hence it is necessary to give credit to those who work hard under difficult situation to build a bridge acceptable to all. It is necessary to remember everything that happened in the past to make a proper analysis; but it is quite unnecessary to remind everything in a purposeful discourse.
As one would expect the British government wants Sri Lanka to fully implement UN Human Rights Council Resolution 34/1, according to the answer of the Foreign & Commonwealth Office Minister, Mark Field.
Answering three written questions submitted by a Labour MP he indicated that he stressed to Sri Lankas Foreign Minister, Tilak Marapana, and the importance of implementing the Resolution.
The UK is committed to the full implementation of Resolution 34/1 and will continue to support the government of Sri Lanka in its efforts to promote reconciliation and human rights, he noted. This may influence other counties in Europe and America to take up the same position.
Resolution 30/1 recognized the importance of a credible accountability process for those most responsible for violations and abuses. It also called for the participation in Lankan judicial accountability process of Commonwealth and other foreign judges, defence lawyers, and authorized prosecutors and investigators. Lankan government has not accepted latter as a necessity. However the commitments include the return of all military-held private land, the activisation of the Office of Missing Persons and the development of new counter-terrorism legislation instead of PTA in line with international human rights standards.
UN Human Rights Council resolution
However the release of another 29 acres of land under military control in Jaffna to civilian owners is a signal that the government remains committed to the reconciliation process it embarked upon in January 2015 when it came to power. The high point of the governments commitment came nine months later in October of that year when it went beyond expectations in co-signing the UN Human Rights Council resolution on Sri Lanka. In the past Mahinda regime had considered previous UN resolutions on the subject to be Imperialists interventions in Lanka and to be necessarily opposed and rejected.
In the modern world human rights are implement by world authorities due to the power of the proletariat and the conscious middle classes in the developed world. One could see the power of active masses in US against the policies of President Donald Trump. As such the Yahapalana government turned this negative approach around. The problem, however, has been that the governments implementation of its commitment has subsequently been slow. This has given rise to doubts about the governments commitment to the reconciliation process. With the holding of local government elections looming on the horizon, the present circumstances are not the best for the government to disturb the peace process. Though it is local government election the results of these elections will be seen as a vote of confidence in the performance of the government midway in its tenure.
The clearing of the path to conducting the long delayed local government election is almost complete. The delay is not due to intervention of leaders of Yahapalanaya government. This delay in elections was due to a combination of factors. The need to re-demarcate local authority areas and boundaries has given rise to extended work for several departments. The fascistic interventions by the previous government which sought to manipulate electoral areas by altering their boundaries to gain an unfair political advantage at elections have created many problems. To the restless political activists, it was also evident that the government was delaying for reasons of its own, which included reluctance to face the electorate in the midst of the many controversies among the leaders.
Constitutional reform and war crime issues
One set of controversies that the government would wish to settle before any election is based on solutions to the Tamil national problem. These go to the heart of racism and its attendant high emotions. The fascistic opposition has denounced the proposed new constitution as paving the way for the division of the country and denounced war crime investigations as being an insidious means to punish war heroes. According to them Gotabhaya and others suspected of criminal activities are above the law as war heroes! In former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his colleagues in the Joint Opposition, the country has the most potent demagogies with ringing voices to arouse Sinhala Buddhist racism with lethal effect. Obviously Prime Minister Wickremesinghe does not want to raise constitutional reform and war crime issues in the run up to local government elections.
However the opposition will devastate the country with vile racist campaigns. On the other hand at the present time all attention is being focused on the forthcoming local government elections, the constitutional reform process is likely to come to a halt. At this time a government victory will give it the confidence it can prevail to take the new constitution forward and face the referendum which will need to be called sooner rather than later.
Clearly a breakdown of the constitutional reform process will be a political defeat for the government whether or not it wins at the local government elections. It will also be a big blow to the Tamil and Muslim parties, Sama Samaja parties and voters, whose support was decisive in bringing the yahapalana government to power.
Clearly, it is constitutional change that will ensure the national and religious minorities are not dependent on the goodwill of government or opposition politicians and their temporary opportunist policies, but on guarantees that come from more permanent law; the constitution. Both public opinion polls and prevalent public opinion on the street clearly indicate that most of the population believes constitutional reform is important, not least because the present constitution is defective and needs to be changed in a comprehensive manner.
In February 4, 1978 when this dictatorial constitution came in to affect Nava Sama Samaja party opposed it publicly hoisting black flags throughout the country. Several months later NM joined them creating a broad opposition. From that time, when the present constitutions executive presidential system was subject to abuse, academic and civil society opinion formers have critiqued the constitution and called for its replacement. Therefore, the popular movement to change the present constitution has a much longer history than the governments present bid to formulate a new constitution.
Different political parties
The three day parliamentary debate on a report on constitutional reform by a select committee of parliament was extended by a further two days reflecting the interest of parliamentarians in the subject. On the positive side there was a broad consensus among all the parties that the matters that were being debated were important to the country, and needed to be discussed at length.
The general thinking in the country is that the coalition of the two biggest parties in the government provides the best opportunity to address the unresolved problems of the past, particularly the nationality conflict. They have a stable 2/3 majority in parliament on their own.
There is agreement that this is the time to address problems that cannot be neglected any longer. However, there was no consensus on the positions taken by the different political parties on the substance of the options for constitutional reform during the debate. This includes the issues of federal power sharing, the units of devolution, executive presidency and the incorporation of some aspects of international legal standards. There is a serious struggle in the coming period to establish a democratic constitution.

Ex-USA Gymnastics doctor jailed for 60 years for child porn
Washington: Former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar -- accused of sexually assaulting more than 100 young girls in his care, including members of the gold-medal winning US Olympic team -- was sentenced to 60 years in prison on Thursday for child pornography.
The 54-year-old Nassar, who is facing sentencing next month on separate sexual assault charges, pleaded guilty in July to three counts of possessing child pornography.
The doctor, who worked at Michigan State University in addition to USA Gymnastics, was found to be in possession of more than 37,000 graphic videos and images of child pornography on his computer hard drives.
He was given the maximum 20 years in prison on each count by US District Judge Janet Neff at a federal court hearing in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
"He has demonstrated that he should never again have access to children," Neff was quoted by the local Lansing State Journal newspaper as saying.
"You have to wonder whether he felt he was omnipotent, whether he felt he was getting away with something so cleverly," she added. Nassar said in court he was ashamed of his actions and had lost everything.
"You go back and you wonder how I got down this path to begin with," the Journal quoted him as telling the judge.
"I'm going to take every day of your sentence to try to better myself."
Nassar has been accused of molesting more than 100 female athletes during the three decades he worked with USA Gymnastics and at Michigan State. He has pleaded guilty to 10 counts of sexual assault in two other cases in Michigan, admitting that he abused young athletes under the guise of offering medical treatment.
He could face life in prison when he is sentenced on those charges next month.
His case was part of a wide-ranging scandal which forced the resignation of USA Gymnastics chief Steve Penny in March.
Penny was accused by victims of failing to quickly notify authorities about abuse allegations.
Olympic gold medalists McKayla Maroney, Aly Raisman and Gabby Douglas are among the members of the USA Gymnastics team who have said they were sexually assaulted by Nassar. AFP

FIFA slaps Peru captain Guerrero with one-year drug ban
Paris: Peru captain Paolo Guerrero will miss the World Cup after been banned from football for a year for failing a drugs test, FIFA's disciplinary committee announced on Friday.
The 33-year-old attacker, who plays for Brazilian giants Flamengo, was handed the ban after "testing positive for cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine".
The drug control came following a match in Argentine capital Buenos Aires on October 5, the world football governing body's watchdog said in a statement.
The former Bayern Munich striker missed Peru's play-off victory over New Zealand, which made the South American nation the 32nd and last country to qualify for the World Cup, after being provisionally suspended for 30 days for the offence on November 3.
That suspension was then extended by 20 days on Tuesday before the final verdict was given on Friday.
Guerrero will now miss Peru's first World Cup since 1982, his country deprived of one of its most important attacking players as it prepares to face France, Australia and Denmark in Group C. AFP

Five cricketers whose jerseys should be retired
On Wednesday, the BCCi decided to unofficially retire the jersey of Indian batting great Sachin Tendulkar.
A furore was created in September when fast bowler Shardul Thakur was seen wearing the iconic number on his jersey, but since that day, he has been seen wearing the number 54 on his back in a few warm-up matches.
We look at five other greats of the game, who could also have their jerseys retired:
5. VIRAT KOHLI
The number 18 has become synonymous with Virat Kohli
Ever since the 29-year-old began to play for India in limited-overs cricket from his Under-19 days, under his name behind his jersey, the number 18 has remained constant.
The reason for Kohli to pick that number was because his father passed away on the 18th of December 2006. At the time of his fathers passing, the right-hander was of the same age as well.
Since his breakthrough limited-overs hundred against Sri Lanka in Kolkata, the Delhi-based cricketer has evolved himself into a modern-day great in coloured clothing, winning matches almost single-handedly for his country.
His tally of 32 ODI hundreds is second only to Sachin Tendulkar and if he continues his hunger for the three-figure mark, he might well break his record in a few years time.
It would only be fitting if the number belonged to Kohli, post his retirement from cricket.
4.KUMAR SANGAKKARA
Kumar Sangakkara wore the number 11 on his back for most part of his career.
Arguably Sri Lankas greatest batsman in all-forms of cricket, Kumar Sangakkaras jersey number during his career remained 11.
According to numerology, the number 11 is associated with wisdom.
The left-hander was the lynchpin in the Lankan batting line-up, with an appetite for big scores, which would invariably put his side in a strong position in the game.
Up until his last limited-overs competition- the 2015 World Cup- he hammered attacks all over the world, scoring four consecutive hundreds, before the teams exit in the quarter-final stage of the competition.
While many Lankan players have not had their jersey numbers retired, Sangakkara is surely one of the deserving candidates to have the number 11 made his own.
3.RICKY PONTING
Ricky Ponting wore the jersey number of 14 almost all his career.
The most successful Australian captain and arguably the greatest Number 3 to play the game, it would be hard to ignore Ricky Ponting if there is a debate on the greatest players who played the game of cricket.
During the course of his 17-year limited-overs career, the right-hander had the digits 14 on the back of his jersey, as he went about his business of plundering bowling attacks all around the world.
The only captain after Clive Lloyd to win the back-to-back 50-over World Cups, Ponting has never made it clear what the number 14 meant, but if there was one recently-retired Australian player who deserves his jersey number to be retired, it would be him.
2.AB DE VILLIERS
AB de Villiers has been wearing the number on his back for a long time.
If a popularity check were done in India for who is considered the favourite overseas cricketer by the Indian public AB de Villiers will rank high on that list, if not finish on top.
The South African right-hander, who made his ODI debut in 2004, has always worn the number 17 on his back, while playing for the Proteas.
According to a report on The Hindu, the 33-year-old wears the number on his back because he was born on the 17th of February 1984, and made his Test debut against England on the 17th of December 2004.
AB de Villiers will go down as one of the best cricketers that South Africa has ever produced and once he is done with the game, one hopes that his jersey number is retired as well.
1.MS DHONI
MS Dhoni has worn the number on his back since he started playing
If there is one cricketer after Sachin Tendulkar who deserves his jersey number to be retired once he quits the game, it is Mahendra Singh Dhoni.
Ever since representing India for the first time in 2004, the 35-year-old has been seen with the number 7on his back whenever he donned the coloured clothing for India.
There are varied reasons behind him having the number behind his back.
Few believe that it is because his birthday falls on the 7th of July, while others say it is because he was inspired by some of the greatest Manchester United players who have succeeded after wearing that number on their jersey.
Whatever maybe the reason, the number has proven to be extremely successful for him and Indian cricket and it would be fitting to the legend if the number is retired after he calls it quits from the game. - SK

Havies have the edge over CR
It will be an exciting tussle for supremacy when CR & FC lock horns with arch rivals Havelock's Sports Club in the first leg of the Dialog A Division inter club league rugby tournament match for the Commander Eustace Matthysz trophy at Longden Place, kick off will be at 4.00 pm today.. Going by how the two teams fared this season, Havies have a definite chance of coming on top and this factor makes the event a thrilling tussle.
The trophy, is named after Commander Eustace Matthysz, a rugby stalwart and former dynamic Ceylon prop forward who also represented Sri Lanka Navy and Havelocks SC with distinction, before he brought fame and honour to the country as the President of the Asian Rugby Football Union in 1974. This coveted trophy is on offer since 1991 and was won by the Red Shirts in the inaugural year, beating the Park Club by an aggregate of 14 points to 12.
It is the Park Club which won last year by an aggregate of 41 points to 16 after winning both legs,(10-06) at the end of a closely contested battle at Havelock Park in the first leg and triumphed by 31 points to 10 in the second leg at Longden Place, hence they are the current holders of the trophy.
The lads from the Longden Place lost their last three matches in a row to young CH and FC side by 12-19 and to Army side by 20 points to 24 and lost again to the formidable Kandy SC 12-24 last week at Longden Place. Havelocks were really fortunate and just managed to edge out the fighting Army SC by 29-19 at Police Park last week after a close game.
Red shirts will have a definite advantage when it comes to the two hookers where in form Supun Warnakulasooriya will strike very much faster and will be the man to watch in the loose play than the Havies hooker Prasath Madushanka.
The Park Club boys with the presence of a sturdy set of forwards who are capable of pulling off the game in their favour, will have to play a vital role in today's game and if the speedy three quarter line of the Havies spearheaded by their dynamic play maker former Peterite and the present national centre Nishone Perera delivers the desired results today then it will be a daunting task for the Red Shirts in countering their attack to gain a much needed victory in the end.
CR & FC (Probable XV)
Udara Gayan, Supun Warnakulasooriya, Kokila Sammandapperuma, Gayan Jayamanna, Charana Chamikara, Sashika Ashan, Shemal Weerasekara, Omalka Gunaratne, Kavindu De Costha and Tharinda Ratwatte, Sashan Mohamad, Kushan Indunil, Rehan Silva, Kavindu Perera (Captain), Reeza Rafaideen,

CH-Air Force a close game on the card
The confrontation between two top rugby clubs in CH and FC and Air Force SC in the Dialog A Division inter-club league rugby first round match at Air Force grounds in Ratmalana today should turn out to be a close game. The match will kick off at 4.00 pm.
CH and FC who has been really playing well this season came to their normal pattern of play from their very first match against Kandy under their new captain Rohitha Chichi Rajapaksha.
The CH side has been training hard under the coaching of dedicated and hard working former national coach Western Samoan Tavita Tulagaese Laga last few weeks and they are determined to pull off a morale-boosting win.
Air Force on the other hand started training two to three months back under the watchful eyes of their new coach ex Airmen Saumya Silva who is also a former Air Force captain some time back. Airmen will have to be at their very best if they are to beat the rejuvenated CH team even though it is on their home grounds at Ratmalana.
The forte of the CH & FC team has been their power-packed forwards. The CH eight especially their ever green flankers Yoshitha Rajapaksa and Sasanka Ariyaratne, along with Sathya Ranathunga, Terence Henry, Matheesha Sarathchandra and Sajith Saranga have always given a terrific display in the loose but today they will be given a torrid time by the Air Force forwards spear headed by crack national flanker Radeesha Seneviratne along with burly Saraka Waralla, captain Pushpakumara Samarahewa, Dinesh Weerarathne Madagedara brothers Prasad and Ranuka ably supported by Charles Praveen.
In the set scrums the CH hooker ex Peterite Ravin yapa should get the better of his vis-a-vis Parakrama Rathnayake while the line outs should be shared between the CH duo of Saranga and Sarathchandra and Air Force's Madagedara and Thilina Bandara.
With the halves combination of Avishka Lee and Shamry Burah having clicked very well in the last couple of matches the CH side will hope that Avishka will set his three quarters in motion at every turn as they have two hard running centres in Lee Keegal and Ryan Weerakoon.
In addition they have two experienced wingers in Anuradha Herath and Dinushan Ariyapala who have stood out with their powerful runs down the flank with full back Samuel Maduwantha often joining the line to form the overlap.
Going by the two team's starting line ups a close tussle for supremacy can be expected.
CH and FC (Probable XV)
Sathya Ranathunga, Ravin yapa, Terrence Henry, Matheesha Sarathchandra, Sajith Saranga, Sasanka Ariyaratne, Yoshitha Rajapaksha, Rohitha Rajapaksa(Captain), Avishka Lee and Shamri Burah, Dinushan Ariyapala, Lee Keegal, Rayan Weerakoon, Anurada Herath, Samuel Maduwantha,

IMF completes third review, approves US$ 251.4 million
The IMF Executive Board completed the third review of Sri Lankas Extended Fund Facility arrangement which enables the disbursement of US$ 251.4 million.
While the authorities met fiscal targets and legislated the income tax reform, further consolidation is necessary, given Sri Lankas high debt burden and large gross financing needs.
Further buildup of international reserves under greater exchange rate flexibility will help reduce Sri Lankas external vulnerability.
On December 6, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the third review of Sri Lankas economic performance under the program supported by a three-year extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement. Completion of the review enables the disbursement of the equivalent of SDR 177.774 million (about US$ 251.4 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to the equivalent of SDR 537.456 million (about US$ 759.9 million).
Sri Lankas three-year extended arrangement was approved on June 3, 2016, in the amount of about SDR 1.1 billion (US$1.45 billion, or 185 percent of quota in the IMF at that time of approval of the arrangement.
The governments reform program, supported by the IMF, aims to reduce the fiscal deficit, rebuild foreign exchange reserves, and introduce a simpler, more equitable tax system to restore macroeconomic stability and promote inclusive growth.

Korea Eximbank funds US$ 14 mn for garbage collection compactors
The Export-Import Bank of Korea approved US$14 million to supply garbage collection compactors to Sri Lanka.
This project will provide 190 garbage compactors to local authorities in all nine Provinces to collect and transfer waste to dumping sites.
Korea Eximbank which operates the ECDF(Economic Development Cooperation Fund) entrusted by Korean Government will finance this project with a high concessional EDCF compact loan of 0% interest rate and 30 year repayment period including ten year grace period.
The project executing agency will be the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Council and Local Government whereas the National Solid Waste Management Centre under the purview of the same Ministry will function as the project management unit.
The main objective of this project is to improve the solid waste management system through reduction in travel time and maintenance cost of collection vehicles and increase the waste collection quantity.
The supply of garbage compactors project does not have only economic meaning but also diplomatic meaning.
The Korean government's decision to finance this project comes at a significant time as this year 2017 marks the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and the Republic of Korea.

KP under protective custody - Kabir
Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim yesterday confirmed that former LTTE chief international financier Kumaran Pathmanathan alias KP was being detained in an Army camp.
Hashim addressing a media briefing at Sirikotha, answered questions with regard to the current whereabouts of the most senior member of the LTTE and assured the media that he was under Army custody.
Unlike the former government, we have taken him from Visumpaya and shifted him into protective custody. Legal action is being taken against him, the Minister said.
Labour and Trade Union State Minister Ravindra Samaraweera stressed that it was baseless for the Joint Opposition to criticise them over the Constitution and state that it was one which would hand over the country to the LTTE, when it was they who protected and shielded KP from legal action.
Sarath Weerasekara now says that Wigneswaran has become more vociferous under this government and that he was silent during the previous regime. But, I would like to ask them why they kept K.P.at Visumpaya and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka at Welikada, Samaraweera said.
The Joint Opposition has no moral ground to ask us about the LTTE, he added.
The Court of Appeal on December 3 was allowed to travel overseas as the petition filed against him was dismissed by the courts. JVP Parliamentarian Vijitha Herath had filed a petition seeking a Writ of Mandamus ordering the Inspector General of Police to arrest him under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Penal Code for financing the LTTE.
The Court of Appeal dismissed the petition stating that there was no legal foundation to take it before courts as the Deputy Solicitor General, Priyantha Nawana informed court that according to the reports submitted by the IGP and the Director General of the Criminal Investigations Department, Kumaran Pathmanathan, the respondent to the petition was not connected to any of the crimes mentioned.

Over 70 percent deaths in SL caused by NCDs - Rajitha
In the world about 70 percent of deaths take place due to Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and in Sri Lanka about 75 percent of deaths take place due to NCDs.
A lot of work should be done in order to control and minimize NCDs, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the gathering during the award presentation for the best performances in Well Woman Clinic Programme (2016) held at Temple Trees yesterday, he said that over 800 Healthy Life Style Centres and over 800 Well Woman Clinics operate countrywide at the moment and the WHO highly praised Sri Lanka's health system. The WHO recognized Sri Lankan health system as a role model for the rest of the countries in the world.
According to Minister Senaratne the world bank especially recognized Sri Lankan health sector as a very successful one and invited Sri Lankan Health Minister for the meeting held in April attended by Finance Minister and Foreign Minister. Previously, no other Health Minister has being invited for this meeting other than the Finance Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister.
The World Bank offered USD 200 million (Rs. 30,000 million) to control NCDs for a period of five years.Controlling NCDs is the main challenge faced by Sri Lankan health sector at the moment.
The whole world is watching the Sri Lankan health sector. Revolutionary decisions were made after January, 2015 in the Sri Lankan health sector in order to ensure the well being of people.
The use of tobacco has been controlled in SL through the biggest tax in the world and tax imposed on sugar has helped discourage the use of excessive sugar.
The prices of drugs have been reduced drastically. Everything has been done on behalf of the country and not to change a government or a political party, he added.
Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe said that the primary health care will be developed according to a concept of Minister Senaratne from the end of next year with World Bank assistance. He said that Sri Lanka's screening system for diseases is excellent and that in the past only rich and educated women were concerned about Pap Smear etc. but now it has reached village level.
Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa, Family Health Bureau Director Dr. Priyani Senadhira and many others were present at the occasion.

Although a Chinese investment, H'tota Port would function within Sri Lankan framework
The Hambantota Port would function within the legal framework of Sri Lanka although it becomes a Chinese investment, said Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama in Parliament yesterday.
He said that the Hambantota Port was constructed at a cost of Rs. 183 billion. "However, its burden had been put on the people," Minister Samarawickrama said. "The government is taking measure to reduce the burden of the people. Massive investments would be attracted to the country due to this move and large number of employment opportunities would be created in due course."
He made these observations, during the debate on the resolution under the Strategic Development Act on Gazette Notifications on the shareholder agreement on two joint venture businesses: the Hambantota International Port Group (Pvt.) Ltd. (HIPG) and the Hambantota International Port Services (Pvt.) Ltd. (HIPS), which would operate commercial and common user facilities respectively, at the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port.
Chief Oppostion Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake joining the debate, said that this agreement would be inked following a debate in Parliament. The Hambantota Port has been handed over to a Chinese company for 99 years. The Ports Authority brought in a new investment. Tax relief had to be granted to the Ports Authority. The Hambantota Port has been estimated at US$ 1,400 million. "The tax relief that was not enjoyed by the Ports Authority earlier, has been granted to these companies," Anura Dissanayake said. "These companies have been released from income tax for a period of 32 years. Chinese nationals working in the Hambantota Port have been released from payee tax for a period of seven years. But Sri Lankans have not been granted the same relief. These tax reliefs should be amended."
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said that the clause that MP Dissanayake pointed out 'agreements would be inked following a debate in Parliament' was changed. When we brought it for discussions in Parliament, the opposition created a tense situation and it was passed without debate.
The minister further said that this investment was US$ 1.12 billion. "All countries in the South Asian region attempted to attract the same investment to their countries," Minister Samarasinghe said. "In such a situation, we have to provide such tax reliefs. On the other hand, these reliefs has been approved by the Cabinet. We have not done it stealthily. This is just the beginning and yet another US$ 600 million have to be invested."
Joint Opposition Member Indika Anuruddha said that government members while they were in the opposition during the previous regime, criticized the Hambantota Port as a swimming pool of Mahinda Rajapaksa. They did not commend it as a valuable asset and its strategic importance as they do today. The did condemn the Mattala Airport in the same manner.
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said that the motion had to receive a two thirds majority of Parliament. "Or else, the Chinese would face a serious legal issue if this motion is not passed with a two third majority. This matter is before the Supreme Court," MP Gunawardena said."
Former President provided adequate security:PM
Providing additional security to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa when he attends the forthcoming Local Government Election rallies could be considered if a formal request was made to the Law and Order Ministry, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The Prime Minister made this observation in reply to a question raised by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena in Parliament yesterday.
The MP requested for additional security personnel, vehicles and other requirements needed by the former President during the upcoming election season, reiterating threats to his life. He requested the Government to reinstate the number of security personnel reduced from former President Rajapaksas security contingent during the election period.
MP Gunawardena quoting Neena Gopal's The Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, pointed out how the lack of security led to the former Indian Premiers assassination. The Prime Minister replying to the above concern, said such unfortunate incidents would not occur in Sri Lanka.
We have a special advantage by protecting Mahinda Rajapaksa. We would not let any harm happen to him, he added in a lighter vein.
The PM detailed that a security contingent of 154 that comprises an Assistant Superintendent of Police, Chief Inspector, nine Inspectors of Police, 14 Sub Inspectors, female Sub inspector, 31 Police Sergeants, two female Police Sergeants, four Police Sergeant Drivers, 63 Police Constables, 14 Sub Police Constable Drivers and four female Police Constables have been provided to former President Rajapaksa.
He said former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas security contingent was only 61.
The security for former Executive Presidents had been provided based on threat assessments and intelligence reports. Based on those reports Mahinda Rajapaksa had been provided with more security. If he wishes for more security, let him make a request to the Law and Order Ministry. I assure you that we give special consideration for requests of the fourth and fifth Executive Presidents of the country, the PM commented.
Daham Pasal will be made compulsory by 2019 :Buddhasasana Minister
Buddhasasana, Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera said that Daham Pasal education would be made compulsory by 2019.
He said so, joining the Committee Stage debate of the Budget 2018 under Expenditure Heads of the Ministry of Buddhasasana, in Parliament yesterday.
We are taking this stand with the intention of making it the core that spreads Buddhism to the world. There is no point in simply talking about Theravada if we do not implement it practically. We wish to develop tourism in a decent and meaningful manner. We could develop the economy within the principles of Buddhism. We need to develop our minds as the mind is the most powerful weapon. Hence, we need to connect the village and temple on a strong bond, The Minister noted that it served no purpose in having the best buildings and facilities, if we were unable to establish a just and spiritual society. Citing a Native American proverb - When the last tree has been cut down, the last fish caught, the last river poisoned, only then will we realize that one cannot eat money, the minister said.
Money alone is not enough and we also need compassion and care for all living beings and the environment.It is a sin to go to temples and churches and spread hatred. We are not just proposing the propagation of daham paasals, but our aim is to commence a drive to make country's people religious not just by word but also by deed, he added.
Fourth Public Accounts Committee report presented to Parliament
The fourth Public Accounts Committee report was presented to Parliament yesterday, by its Chairman, Deputy Minister of Finance and Mass Media Lasantha Alagiyawanna.
The Public Accounts Committee's responsibility was to examine the accounts showing the appropriation of the sums granted by Parliament to meet public expenditure and to probe the managerial efficiency and financial discipline of the Government, its Ministries, Departments, Provincial Councils and Local Authorities, which the minister said, had been carried out satisfactorily.

Tourism sector recorded highest tourist arrivals of 2.2 million in 2016:Amaratunge
Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunge said that in 2016, the tourism sector recorded the highest tourist arrival of 2.2 million earning $ 3.5 billion to the national coffers. He said despite unforeseen challenges they had to face, the tourism industry was resilient in weathering these storms and was on track to achieve the target of surpassing the two million mark and reaching the set target of 2.5 million.
He said so, joining the Committee Stage debate of the Budget 2018 under the Expenditure Heads of the Ministry of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs in Parliament yesterday.
Noting that the Travel and Tourism Competitive Index published by the World Economic Forum in Geneva, ranked Sri Lanka highly in its competitive rankings, he said the total revenue that had been earned by related public sector institutions, had been milked from the booming tourism industry running into billions of rupees. Earnings by Heritage sites in the Cultural Triangle forms the largest source of income, he said.
Emphasizing on the contribution to employment in the country through the tourism industry, the minister said, The contribution of the tourism industry towards employment generation, was a bonus, while tourism could be considered an umbrella industry with direct and indirect employment totalling to over 320,000. However, if we take into consideration all other sectors related to tourism and travel enterprises, this figure would be around 800,000. But was expected to increase further.
The minister noted that in providing a strategic direction towards the tourism sector, the government has launched Tourism Vision 2025 strongly founded on the principles of sustainable tourism and the blue-green economy, aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development goals. Building on Tourism Vision 2025, we have launched a four year strategic plan for 2017-2020 which targets doubling of revenue and employment in the industry by 2020, ensuring long-term sustainability of the industry, he said.
In terms of increasing accommodation to meet the rising demand, room capacity has risen by 52 percent with an addition of 7,622 rooms during 2010-2016 and the capacity in the supplementary establishments had risen by 96% with an addition of 5,640 rooms during the same period, Minister Amaratunge said.
He pointed out that the country could not sustain the tourism industry simply by marketing the countrys beaches alone. He said the country should pursue ways to differentiate and add value in a crowded and highly competitive market, while consolidating the countrys position in areas such as experiential and MICE tourism.
According to the Tourism Minister, Nanu Oya, Galle, Ella and Colombo Fort Railway Stations would be modernised and declared as archaeological sites.
Sri Lanka Telecom evaluated country's 10th best institution:Harin
Sri Lanka Telecom(SLT) needs to be restructured and done even with the intervntion of Parliament, said Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando in Parliament yesterday.
He also said that although joint opposition members charged otherwise, the SLT was so successful that it was evaluated as the 10th best institution in the country by Business Today. "Its profits seemed to have dropped due to the depreciation of currency and not due to its ill management," said Minister Fernando. "Trade Union activists don't understand this situation, while the members should not level criticism based on their claims."
He made these observations yesterday, while considering the report of the Select Committee on the Buddha Sasana Ministry, Posts, Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs Ministry, Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Ministry, Special Assignment Ministry, Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Ministry and Science Technology and Research Ministry, during the Committee Stage debate on budget proposals for financial year 2018.
Minister Harin Fernando further said the Ministry Secretary had made a statement that Rs. 15 billion was allocated to the Ministry last year and without our knowledge had been misinterpreted by opposition members. What the Secretary meant was that the project was not one that was suggested by the Ministry. He added that the ICTA project was to digitalize the entire country. "We called for tenders, but failed as we stuck to the law," Minister Fernando said. "If we practiced the same method as the previous government, we could have done so. But if we failed, we would have been blamed throughout our entire life."

The government intends to set up this area as a main tourism zone in the country.
We also intend to include eco friendly water sports facilities for tourists, while this project would also create a large number of employment opportunities.

Parties in JO leaving: Rajitha
"Several parties in the Joint Opposition (JO) are leaving `opportunists' politics'. We will see how many remain to contest the 2020 elections once the investigations on corruption end. This Government will rule the country till 2025," Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratn said.
The Minister was addressing the UNP Balamandala (General Committee) meeting held at Sucharitha Hall, Keselwatta yesterday under the patronage of Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe.
He said the Middle Eastern countries ended dictatorships in January 2015 through revolutions but Sri Lankan people ended it in peace. The President and the Prime Minister got together and created the National Government to develop the country.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that Germany has a national government and Indian Prime Minister wants to have one but he meets so many difficulties.
"The UNP face the election in a victorious path because several parties in the JO have strugged against `opportunists' politics'. Some ask what this Government did. They calculate everything by the price of coconut and rice. This Government increased the salaries of public servants by Rs. 10,000 and reduced the pries of gas, fuel among others," he said.
He said the Government increased the Mahapola Scholarship and Samurdhi grants.
"The expenditure of the present President is far less than the previous. The previous gave lifts to rapists and robbers in his vehicle. Wasim Thajudeen was murdered since he was an excellent ruggerist. Many media personnel speak to culprits who come out after giving evidence. Only three media personnel report the evidence given at commissions," he said.

Players with six as their first scoring shot in Test cricket
Sunil Ambris' Test debut was a delight for the cricket statisticians even though the West Indian aggregated only 18 runs in the game against the Kiwis. The middle-order batsman had an eventful debut game as he got out via hit-wicket on the very first ball off his Test career. Thus, he became the only player to bag a duck on Test debut via hit-wicket. Ambris was also one of the 11 players to bag a duck via hit-wicket in this format and one of the 11 players to be dismissed via hit-wicket on debut.
In the 2nd innings, Ambris tried to play a pull off Trent Boult and accumulated six with help of the top edge helping him to open his account in Test cricket with a six. He didn't last long in the 2nd innings as he departed after scoring 18 off 32 balls which included a couple of fours as well. By scoring his first runs in Test cricket with a six, Sunil Ambris became only the 11th known player to open runs account with a six in this format.
The first of the 11 players was Australia's Eric Freeman, who struck a huge six off Erapalli Prasanna on the very 2nd ball he faced in his debut Test match at the Gabba in 1968. The 2nd one was Windies' Carlisle Best, who hooked Ian Botham for a six on the 3rd ball he faced in the 1986 Kingston Test on his debut. After Best, it needed 19 years to witness a player opening his account in Test cricket with a six when Zimbabwe's Keith Dabengwa hit Daniel Vettori for a six to get off the mark that too after facing 15 balls.
Dale Richards, who made his Test debut in 2009 against Bangladesh, following the strike by regular players, hit a six off the 4th ball he faced. Richards opened the innings and got off the mark in the very first over of the innings with a huge hit off Mashrafe Mortaza. The next three players to achieve the feat were from Bangladesh whose 2nd scoring shot was also a six. Shafiul Islam hit a six in the first innings on debut and got out on the very next ball in Amit Mishra's bowling.
In the 2nd innings, Shafiul took once again on Mishra by hitting his 5th ball for a six. The Bangladeshi tried for another big one but instead produced a catch which was put down by an Indian fielder which saw the pacer getting his first runs which weren't a six in Test cricket. Jahirul Islam, who bagged a duck in his first innings, opened his account with sixes off Graeme Swann and James Tredwell in the 2nd innings. Al-amin Hossain got to face only one ball on debut, hit the 3rd ball he faced in the next innings for a six and went unbeaten on 6 off 7 balls. In the same game, Al-Amin opened his account with a six off the 2nd ball in the 2nd innings.
New Zealand's Mark Craig achieved a distinction of hitting the first ball he faced for a six in Test cricket which was also the first ball he ever faced in International cricket. Sri Lanka's DHANANJAYA DE SILVA got off the mark in Test cricket with a six on his Test debut against Australia last year. Kamrul Islam was the recent most one before Sunil Ambris with this feat as the Bangladeshi scored his first runs in Test cricket on the 20th ball he faced after bagging three ducks in three innings.

Serena entered for 'family-friendly' Australian Open
Sydney: New mum Serena Williams has accepted a place at the Australian Open and is "anticipated to return" to the tournament in January, less than five months after giving birth, organisers said Friday.
The defending women's champion was among 98 of the 100 top women, and all of the men's top 100, to be "confirmed" for the season's opening Grand Slam, they said.
World number ones Simona Halep and 16-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal will both be in Melbourne, but all eyes will be on Williams, who won this year's tournament while pregnant.
Tournament director Craig Tiley said this week it was "highly likely" she will make her comeback at the opening Grand Slam of the season, and he repeated those sentiments Friday.
"Last year's tournament broke all of the records and we look forward to welcoming back new mum Serena as she attempts to equal Margaret Court's 24 Grand Slams," he said in a statement.
"We are definitely a family-friendly event and many players including reigning champion Roger Federer travel with their children to Melbourne so we remain optimistic that she will return."
Williams gave birth to daughter Alexis Olympia in September and married Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian last month. The tournament is also set to see the return of Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, Kei Nishikori and Stan Wawrinka, who have all been out with injuries.
"We have been in regular contact with Andy Murray, Kei Nishikori and Stan Wawrinka, who are all set for the Aussie summer," said Tiley.
"They will all have lower rankings meaning there's a real chance we'll finally see a breakthrough from one of the rising stars like Alexander Zverev, Dominic Thiem or David Goffin." The only two players within the top 100 to pull out so far are Russian world number 12 Svetlana Kuznetsova, who recently underwent wrist surgery, and China's Zheng Saisai, with a right knee injury. The tournament takes place from January 15-28. AFP

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will contest the coming Local Government election as a strong united alliance with number of other political parties, UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday said.
He expressed his confidence that the SLFP will be able to record a definite victory at the coming election.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera was participating in the launching ceremony of the Freshwater Fisher Information System - Infish - at the National Aquaculture Development Authority last Friday.
Rresponding to questions on the ongoing discussions between the SLFP and the Joint Opposition, Minister Amaraweera said that several JO members have finally realised where the real SLFP is and that they have been running after a sheer illusion.
We always attempted not to let SLFP divide. However, several of the JO worked against the discussions between the two groups. I do not believe these discussions be fruitful. Several others think the discussions should continue. What I have to say is that the discussions fell apart because of the some persons' acts. Minister Amaraweera said.
Minister Amaraweera said some political figures form separate parties but they do not affect the SLFP at large.
There have been similar attempts before. All those who parted, came back to the main party. What matters to us is our party, not any individuals. The ones who left the SLFP had to come back. Whoever who attempts to walk away from the SLFP now, will also have to come back to the true SLFP under the headship of President Maithripala Sirisena. Minister Amaraweera said.
Asked if the members of Wimal Weerawansa led Jathika nidahas Peramuna are also joining the SLFP, Minister Amaraweera said not just them, but all who have left the SLFP would realise that peoples power is with the SLFP and rejoin the party.
Asked if the separation gives more advantage to the United National Party, Minister Amaraweera said, "It indeed does, but the victory lies with the SLFP. We wanted this to become a landslide victory. That is why we held discussions with the Joint opposition, he said.

Stand up for Human Rights
Human Rights are a hot topic in this country and worldwide. Tomorrow, the world marks Human Rights Day (December 10), to mark the day the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. This year, Human Rights Day kicks off a year-long campaign to mark the upcoming 70th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a milestone document that proclaimed the inalienable rights which everyone is inherently entitled to as a human being -- regardless of race, colour, religion, sex, language, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.
Drafted by representatives of diverse legal and cultural backgrounds from all regions of the world, the Declaration sets out universal values and a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations. It establishes the equal dignity and worth of every person. Based on the perennial values of equality, justice and human dignity, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights empowers all and stipulates that every Government has a core duty to enable all people to enjoy all their inalienable rights and freedoms. Human Rights encompass not only civil and political rights, but also social, economic and cultural rights.
This years theme StandUp4HumanRights centres on the fact that we need to stand up for our own rights and those of others. If we do not take a stand, there are elements that will strive to take those rights away. We all have a right to live free from all forms of discrimination on the basis of race, religion, skin colour, wealth, political affiliation and ability/disability. We have a right to education, health care, economic opportunities and a decent standard of living. We have rights to privacy and justice. These rights are relevant to all of us, every day. They are the foundation of peaceful societies and sustainable development, with peace and development being the other two pillars on which the UN was established.
Despite these advances, the fundamental principles of the Universal Declaration are being tested in all regions. There is rising hostility towards human rights and those who defend them. We see hatred, intolerance and bigotry. Antagonistic nationalism is on the rise, with surging levels of racism, xenophobia and other forms of discrimination. There are scores of conflicts around the world that claim precious lives every day. Indeed, some practices of the Dark Ages survive to this day  just a few weeks back, international media exposed a slavery ring in Libya where migrants were being sold for US$ 400 each. It is disgusting to think that such practices continue even today, when the world is far more enlightened on Human Rights and related matters.
Sri Lankas Human Rights situation has improved vastly since the Coalition Yahapalana Government took over in January 2015. The previous Government headed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had largely ignored and ridiculed the Human Rights concerns expressed by the International Community with regard to the final stages of the conflict and the general Human Rights environment. It was an abysmal period for Human Rights in the country, with everyone from journalists to academics subjected to white van abductions, torture and even murder. Anyone who dared to stand up for Human Rights was branded a traitor and intimidated.
This led to a major confrontation with the International Community, which resulted in Sri Lanka getting isolated on the world stage. All the well-known democracies had deserted Sri Lanka and only a few countries which themselves had a dubious Human Rights record were by Sri Lankas side. This trend, which could ultimately have resulted in punitive economic sanctions against Sri Lanka, was reversed only when the National Unity Government came to power.
It has since strengthened national Human Rights mechanisms and opened a dialogue with the International Community on Accountability and Human Rights issues. Due to the success of these endeavours, the International Community has given time and space to Sri Lanka to resolve these issues through a domestic mechanism.
The previous regime accused the International Community of interfering in our internal affairs by raising concerns over Human Rights. Its favourite battle cry was that an international conspiracy was on against Sri Lanka with the aim of sending the then President to the electric chair at The Hague. The fact that no such structure or punishment exists at international level was conveniently forgotten.
Human Rights are indeed truly universal and one countrys Human Rights violations affect everyone else. This is the very basis on which the UN Human Rights Council conducts a Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of every UN Member States Human Rights situation. This is a forum where even the poorest, least developed country can question the Human Rights abuses in even the richest, most developed country.
Of course, no country has a perfect Human Rights record. The people should continuously exert pressure on the authorities to guarantee that the rights of all are protected to the fullest. Wherever we are, whoever we are, we must all stand up for our rights to make the world a better place.

Swift relief for farmers affected by extreme weather- PM
A mechanism to provide relief for farming families affected by extreme weather will be developed within two weeks, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was making a special statement in Parliament yesterday on the economic impact of the inclement weather and the steps initiated by the Government to control the cost of living.
The Prime Minister said a Committee comprising of the Secretaries of Finance, Disaster Management, Home Affairs and Agriculture Ministries has been appointed to report to the Cabinet a mechanism to identify the affected farming families and provide relief to them.
He said a Cabinet Subcommittee comprising Ministers Patali Champika Ranawaka, Susil Premajayantha, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and Rauf Hakeem has been appointed to study the impact of climate change on agriculture and make recommendations.
Elaborating on the short term measures decided by the Cabinet this week to control the cost of living the PM said rice and coconut kernel would be imported as necessary to control their prices in the local market.
We have already given approval to import 200,000 MT of rice. Eventhough we got considerable rainfall in November, the monsoon rains were less than expected. We will have to take measures to control the rice prices until the next Maha season harvest reach the market by April next year, he said.
The Prime Minister said a shortage of 40 million coconuts per month has been predicted from January to May next year. He pointed out the economic growth predicted at 5.5 percent of the GDP for 2017 dropped to 4.5 percent due to drought and floods.
The Premier said the agricultural sector showed a -1.2 percent negative growth. I am not giving you excuses. We are ready to take the responsibility. But, the reality must be explained.
The Cabinet when it met last Tuesday and Thursday extensively discussed the measures to bring down the cost of living, he added.
The PM said vegetables and other food items would also be imported if necessary, while taking extra care not to affect the local farmers.
The Prime Minister said a meeting with all relevant stakeholders and representatives of the World Bank and Asian Development Bank has been scheduled next week to discuss the impact of climate change on economy and decide the future course of action.
I believe we need to prepare our economy to be resilient to climate changes. We need to prepare a new mechanism for that purpose. As the agriculture sector has shown a negative growth, we need to accelerate the growth in other sectors of our economy if we are to attain the stipulated economic growth targets, said the PM.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena brought the attention of the PM to take steps to reduce the post-harvest damages, highlighting that 37-40 percent harvest is wasted due to lack of proper storage facilities.
The PM agreeing to the comment said it would be looked in. The PM proposed to have a debate following the LG elections on the medium and long term measures to confront economic challenges faced by climate change.
Regretting the sudden hike in cost of living the PM however assured it would be controlled by January-February next year.

Train commuters stranded
Train commuters were greatly inconvenienced yesterday too due to the islandwide strike launched by the Locomotive Engineering Operators Union (LEOU).
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said the strike had left many commuters stranded at railway stations or on roads while some people even had to skip going to work because of the strike.
The Minister requested Railway Trade Unions to call off their strike considering the inconvenience caused to students sitting the GCE O/L Examination next week.
Minister De Silva has also instructed officials to take all measures to lessen the difficulties that the public have to undergo due to the sudden strike.
Accordingly, the Minister said the SLTB will operate more buses to lessen the inconvenience caused to.
Sri Lanka Railways Deputy General Manager (Commercial) Vijaya Samarasinghe said that train season tickets will be valid for travel in Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) buses due to the ongoing strike.
A Railway Graded Trade Union Collective Spokesman said the token strike was successful as a limited number Railway Control Room officers said around 10 trains operated yesterday despite the strike.Four trains carrying fuel had also left for the Katunayake airport from Colombo Fort.
A Railway Graded Trade Union Collective Spokesman said the token strike was successful as a limited number of trains operated yesterday eventhough on average the Sri Lanka Railways operates about 350 trains on a weekday. The strike, which began on Thursday, continues yesterday.
The strike action was launched on Thursday demanding the solution for long-term problem regarding the recruitment of engine driver assistants.
We have earlier appealed authorities to resolve the problem,but our grievances were not addressed. We have appealed that a separate system be created to recruit drive assistants instead of considering them as equal to engine drivers. But, the problem has not been solved as yet, the Railway Graded Trade Union Collective Spokesman said.
Meanwhile, six other trade unions, including the Train ControllersUnion,Railway Engine Drivers Union, Railway Station Masters Union and the Railway Guards Union had joined the strike from midnight on Wednesday citing several demands.
He said the discussions held with a senior adviser to the Prime Minister earlier were not successful. Meanwhile, discussions held at the Transport Ministry on Wednesday with the participation of the Minister,Transport Ministry Secretary G.S.Withanage, Railway General Manager S. Mahanama Abeywickrama and Locomotive Operating Engineers Union representatives was also fruitless.

Lisbon: Two-time world triple-jump silver medallist Pedro Pablo Pichardo has obtained Portuguese nationality after leaving Cuba in April, he announced on Thursday.

However, Pichardo will not be able to compete in European championships, world championships or the Olympics until the IAAF lifts its freeze on nationality changes, which it will discuss at a meeting in March.
"These questions don't depend on me, it's up to the international federation to take the decisions it deems appropriate," he told a press conference at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, where he now competes for Benfica's athletics club. AFP

UNP geared to win LG polls - Minister Eran
United National Party (UNP) paid deposits for the Dehiwala, Mount Lavinia, Maharagama and Boralesgamuwa local councils at the Colombo district election office yesterday.
State Finance and Media Minister Eran Wickremaratne speaking to the media said the UNP will be victorious and requested the public join hands with the UNP to create a better future.
"All the people who were with us when were in the Opposition and supported us in all good and bad times are going to contest in the upcoming elections. We intend to elect professionals and well educated individuals as representatives, to see a change in the system", he said.
Wickremaratne said UNP is a party that always supported changes for the betterment of the country.
He further said that the biggest change is the increased women's participation in politics and added that it was UNP that took initiatives to increase women's representation at the local level as an advancing step to improve women's involvement in politics.
He noted that UNP was not a party that worked to win elections but always took measures to improve the well-being of the people.

UNP stands ahead in LG poll strategies
With the long delayed elections to Local Government bodies due in the latter half of next February, Election Politics are gathering momentum. Although the polls are for local bodies, covering of all local bodies in the country, and being the first widespread electoral exercise after the major political changes in 2015, with clear political rivalry between the pro-Rajapaksa forces and those who defeated them more than two years ago, the coming polls are being looked at by contending parties almost as a national poll on governance.
The failure of attempts by rival factions of the SLFP  those in government and in the Joint Opposition (JO)  to come to an understanding on unity, or even a no-contest agreement, shows a major disadvantage to the official SLFP led by President Maithripala Sirisena, with efforts to underscore his leadership in the SLFP. This division has certainly given strength to the pro-Rajapaksa group of the SLFP, but the efforts by Mahinda Rajapaksa himself to bring about a measure of unity between the two party factions, does show that the prevailing disunity among the Blue ranks would not be very beneficial to that group either.
It is the UNP that has clearly benefited from this continuing division in the SLFP, being able to stand out as an undivided party, with the unquestioned leadership of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The UNP, which provided the majority of votes for the Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena in the Presidential Poll on January 08, 2015, and obtained a majority in the general election in August 2105, moves to this local government poll as the clear leader in the field, as an undivided party. It also has the advantage of its leader being able to campaign with strength and confidence, with his party having the more influential ministerial portfolios, being more assured of the votes of minority voters, in areas where Tamil, Muslim and Christian minorities will have an impact on the poll.
While the JO, which will contest from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the lotus bud party organized by Basil Rajapaksa and politically led by Mahinda Rajapaksa, has good cause to expect success in the coming polls; the divisions within the SLFP can be a major disadvantage to its campaign. Although SLPP  JO has the members of the UPFA who are not with the Sirisena faction of the SLFP, and goes to these polls showing a majority SLFP membership, it must face the reality that this the first time in any major election that the SLFP is contesting as a divided party. It is far bigger than the division of the late Anura Bandaranaike and Maithripala Senanayake, when they broke away from the SLFP, and supported UNP. The SLPP goes to the polls with blue and red flags, but with the formal leader of the blue party  the President of the country, as a clear rival although not running any candidates in the polls.
Party discipline
The SLPP  JO would also have to consider the danger of disciplinary action by the official SLFP against its members who campaign or contest an election, where they oppose the SLFP, even though the party is not in the field. The SLFP could take a decision that disciplinary action would be taken against those who contest from the SLPP, which it sees as a party opposed to the SLFP. Statements to this effect have been made by members of the pro-Maithripala Sirisena SLFP wing. It is an interesting twist to the politics of rivalry, the key factor in the coming polls.
However, the impact of any such move will have to be seen in the context of how the Sirisena SLFP has so far acted with regard to disciplinary action against members breaking party discipline. SLFP members who participated in two May Day rallies, led by Mahinda Rajapaksa, which were opposed to SLFP rallies led by President Sirisena, had no such action. Also, there was no disciplinary action against SLFP members who participated in the Hyde Park anti-government rally last year.
The issue of disciplinary action has been an unreality in the SLFP from the time of the change of leadership from Rajapaksa to Sirisena. Verbal warnings have been given, there was no action taken, possibly with expectations of future settlements. The issue today is that there are fewer opportunities for future settlements, if the SLPP, with the JO, and the Mahinda Rajapaksa leadership, performs well, not necessarily as first, in the coming local polls.
These divisions in the politics of the SLFP certainly give a major green light to the Green Party and the leadership of Ranil Wickremesinghe, with the message of being the party that will lead the country beyond to 2020. But, it will also have to face up to the reality of the increasing unpopularity of the Unity Government and Yahapalanaya policies. The UNP will also have to face the issue of corruption that has emerged with the Treasury Bond issue, the report of the Presidential Commission now due by December 31, very much in the Local Polls campaign. If it is to draw the maximum support of those who backed it in January and August 2018, the UNP will have to show an understanding of the political situation of President Sirisena, and organise its campaign to get the anti-Rajapaksa SLFP voters to back the Elephant symbol, and keep the vote it obtained in January 2018, as the party of leadership.
Court process
Last week this column focused on the Court process on key areas of government policy and political activity. We dealt with the Appeal Court decisions on the Local Government polls process, and the petition by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa against his possible arrest.
The Courts remain a subject of importance. We said there was much relief for Minister Faiszer Musthapha in being able to inform Parliament that discussions with the petitioners had led to their agreeing to withdraw the petitions, enabling the LG polls to be held. There is now another petition before the Supreme Court with regard to the delimitation of some local authority areas, which would be of considerable interest.
Another matter that continues is the petition by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, who obtained an Interim Order preventing police from acting under the Public Property Act, against Rajapaksa, on the Galle Magistrates Court inquiry over a complaint that the D.A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial in Medamulana was built using public funds amounting to Rs.90 million. This week the Court of Appeal extended this Interim Order till December 15. This extension came after Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne raised objections to the Court delivering an ex parte order regarding the petition filed by Rajapaksa.
The DSG Dayaratne told Court: I have filed limited objections against this order, and can demonstrate on the pleadings filed by the petitioner that there was suppression and misrepresentation of material facts when the application was supported and an Interim Order was obtained ex-parte. I can make my submissions today before this order is extended. I am objecting to the extension of the Interim Order.
This matter will certainly be one of considerable interest, in the context of the governments efforts to fight corruption, particularly what is seen as corruption carried out on the basis of family interests of the Rajapaksas.
The public will certainly be very keen in seeing the how the judicial process moves in this regard, especially considering the new aspect of independence of the judiciary that is seen in court proceedings today, where Gotabhaya Rajapaksa could seek legal relief in this regard; unlike what may have been faced by another petitioner in such a situation, in the Rajapaksa days.
This petition in Court is also one of interest considering the many threats made against the possible arrest of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa in this regard, with opponents from intellectuals, members of the Sangha and former Senior Services Personnel, threatening direct action and protests that could have caused serious threats to law and order, on a matter which could very well have been decided through the Courts.
A touching message has been given about the construction of the D. A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial, at the said costs, to remember the late DA Rajapaksa, being the father of Chamal, Mahinda, Gotabhaya and Basil Rajapaksa, and the grandfather of Namal Rajapaksa, who did serve as Deputy Speaker of Parliament. This could be a moving message of parental respect.
What is forgotten is that DA Rajapaksa entered politics, only after the sudden death of his brother, D. M. Rajapaksa, who entered the State Council from the South, and did begin wearing the brown Kurakkan Sataka  to show his support for the exploited cultivators of the South, during British colonialism.
He was the person who began a tradition of service to the people, and remains forgotten. As for political progeny, his two sons Lakshman and George were politicians who did serve the people, and he also had a political granddaughter Nirupama Rajapaksa. Where do family memorials move with service to the people

Video ref to be used in FA Cup ties
London: Video assistant referees will be used for the first time in English competitive football in this season's FA Cup, the Football Association said on Thursday.
Brighton's third-round clash with Crystal Palace on January 8 has been selected for the trial of the technology, otherwise known as VAR, which is also to be used in selected fixtures throughout the rest of the competition.
The VAR is currently being used in Italy and Germany and was employed for the first time in an official game in Britain during the international friendly between England and Germany in November, when it was not called on.
"The FA has always been open to trialling new innovations and was heavily involved in the advancement of goal-line technology before it was introduced," said the FA's director of professional game relations Andy Ambler. The trials in Britain will also include January's League Cup semi-finals.
Last year the International Football Association Board approved a two-year trialling of the VAR system.
The FA confirmed in its statement that the technology will only be employed to counteract "clear and obvious errors" on specific incidents in three situations: goals, penalty decisions and straight red cards or mistaken identity for red or yellow cards. The VAR will automatically check every relevant incident and will inform the referee of any clear and obvious error.
The referee then has the power to change the original decision based on the new information provided by the VAR, or watch a replay on the side of the pitch. AFP
