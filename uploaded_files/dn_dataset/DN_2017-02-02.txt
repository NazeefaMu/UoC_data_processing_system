Peace Air Chairman
Gamini Wethasinghe told media in Colombo on Tuesday that this will make one member of the seven airline unions as a member of the Director Board. This is a new phenomena in the aviation industry that is being practiced all over the world to ensure the smooth running of the airline and we want to introduce this practice to Sri Lanka.
He said that the seven employee unions have agreed and several members representing the Unions that were present at the event endorsed this. We are happy to partner with Peace Air in the future, they said.
Chairman Gamini Wethasinghe said that they would like to work with the Unions in the future as they believe horizontal management is always good.
Director Peace Air, Iresha Wettasinghe said that they have also come to a framework agreement with Lufthansa Consulting, the advisory arm of Germanys national carrier, Lufthansa Airlines, to perform a due diligence on SriLankan Airlines. This will be completed in eight weeks and it will help us to iron out all gray areas.
We have US $ 5.5 billion (Euro five billion) at our disposal to buy the national carriers, SriLankan and Mihin and have sent a SWIFT via Deutcshe Bank Germany to the National Savings Bank, she said.
She said they plan to terminate all the current leases of the existing fleet of 21 aircraft through international legal channels and will expand the airline to 50 aircraft. We are also looking at purchasing two A380 aircraft by July through a regional carrier in Asia.

PM launches second phase construction of Central Expressway
Marking yet another important milestone in the countrys development in the economic, administrative and transportation spheres, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday inaugurated construction work on the second phase of the Central Expressway at a ceremony held at Kudagammane on the Giriulla  Alawwa road.
This project is undertaken by the Highways Ministry and the Road Development Authority under the guidance of Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella.
Construction work on the second phase is scheduled to be completed in mid 2019. The second phase from Mirigama to Kurunegala consists of 39.29 kilometres.
The Expressway consists of four lanes with a width of 3.6 metres each. The entire width of the Expressway will be 23 metres.
There will be five interchanges between Meerigama and Kurunegala. They are at Mirigama Nakalagamuwa, Malpitiya, Pothuhera and Kurunegala. He entire 2nd phase is built by local contractions. Earlier construction of all Expressways had been entrusted to foreign contractors and the special feature of the second phase construction is that the expenditure made on it will accrue to local contractions, thus eliminating a heavy drain on foreign exchange.

PUCSL to pay interest on security deposits
Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said that they would comply with the guidelines recently issued by the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) to pay an interest on the security deposit of electricity consumers which CEB and LECO received when providing an electricity connection.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said that he had to first present the regulations issued by the PUCSL to Parliament for approval.
He said that it was for the first time after nearly six years that a government was bringing regulations on consumer security in Parliament. It reflects that the Power and Energy Ministry was concerned about the security and contentment of its consumers.
We are still having discussions with the executive board on formulating regulations based on PUCSL. We would very soon initiate these payments, Siyambalapitiya said.
The Minister also appealed to the public to use electricity scarcely, since the severe effects of the drought had not yet subdued despite heavy rain falls.
Even though there were heavy rain falls, water storage capacity of the reservoirs were below 35%, Minister Siyambalapitiya said. He said that it was a challenge to provide electricity with no power-cuts in a condition such as this.
Siyambalapitiya also said the ministry had introduced a special programme in line with power conservation request to win concessions on consumers electricity bills.
Consumers who show a reduction of 10% in February, comparative to the January electricity bill, could send in a SMS to 1987 typed L (space) Your Account Number to register for a facility which would entitle consumers to receive a concession. Siyambalapitiya explained.
He also requested electricity consumers to use LED bulbs instead of incandescent light bulbs, especially in households and factories. He also said the government was planning to give low cost LED bulbs on a monthly payment basis. He said that consumers could get more details from the Ministry of Power and Energy, Ceylon Electricity Board or LECO, by calling 1901, 1987 and 1910 respectively.
Minister Siyambalapitiya was speaking at a media briefing yesterday held at the Ministry premises. Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera and LECO Chairman Lal Gunasekara also spoke at the briefing.

The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry has been tracing the 'Madurajina 2' multi-day fishing boat and its five fishermen ever since the boat has gone missing in the sea for nearly a month, the ministerial news release says.
The release states that Minister Mahinda Amaraweera directed Fisheries Director General Christy Lal Fernando no sooner than the incident was reported to take all necessary measures to locate and rescue the missing boat and the five fishermen.
Although the Navy along with the National Coast Conservation Department launched search operations, they had not found any clue so far. The fisheries authorities in countries in the Indian Ocean too were requested to keep vigil and inform the Sri Lanka authorities any clue regarding the boat.
Accordingly, authorities in Australia, India, Maldives, Pakistan, Myanmar, Seychelles and several other countries were also surveying, but still they had not succeeded in finding any clue.
Sri Lankan multi-day fishing boats as well as those of other nations engaged in fishing in the international maritime zone too had been informed about the missing boat and as soon as any positive information was received, the government would take quick measures to rescue the boat and its fishermen, the press elease states.

Rex Tillerson sworn in as Secretary of State

Rex Tillerson, the former chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil, has been sworn in as President Donald Trumps secretary of state.
The Texas native, 64, was cleared for full Senate approval in a 56-43 vote.
The vote came after Senate Republicans changed the rules in order to approve Trump's nominees for health and treasury, despite a Democratic boycott.
Tillerson, who has never held political office, faced intense scrutiny over his ties to Russia.
As Tillerson was sworn by the vice-president in the Oval Office, the president told him: "Your whole life has prepared you for this moment."
Trump - who had just returned from a Delaware air base where he met the returning remains of a Navy SEAL killed in a weekend raid in Yemen, the first known US combat casualty since he took office - was sombre and subdued in tone.
America's new top diplomat thanked him and said: "As I serve this president, I will always represent the interests of the American people at all times."
The former oil chief forged multibillion-dollar deals with Russia's state oil company, Rosneft, and was awarded the Order of Friendship by the Kremlin in 2013.
In his Senate confirmation hearing, he admitted that the West had reason to be alarmed by Russian aggression, but he refused under questioning to label Mr Putin a war criminal.
As secretary of state, Tillerson will handle relations with countries including China and Russia and negotiate matters such as climate change and human rights, on behalf of President Trump.
The Senate voted largely along party lines, despite speculation that some Republicans would not approve his nomination.
Though some critics suggested Tillerson would not be able to give up his corporate interests, supporters contended his background as a global dealmaker would bring fresh perspective to the role.
Tillerson's confirmation was more contentious than those of his predecessors.
The Senate confirmed former President Barack Obama's selections John Kerry 94-3 and Hillary Clinton 94-2.
President George W Bush's secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, was confirmed 85-13 while Colin Powell was approved by a voice vote.
One of Tillerson's first challenges may be allaying fears at the State Department over President Trump's order to ban travel or immigration from seven mostly Muslim nations.
Nearly 1,000 US diplomats and Foreign Service officers signed a memo of dissent on Tuesday (31) regarding the travel ban.
Tillerson will be tasked with restoring relations with those affected countries as well as outraged European leaders.
British Prime Minister Theresa May, fresh off a US diplomatic visit, opposed the ban on Monday (30).
Also infuriated is Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, who cancelled his planned Washington trip over Trump's insistence that the neighbouring country would pay for a wall along the US border.
"He will start at a disadvantage and will have to play catch-up to build trust with his foreign counterparts and with State Department employees," said John Bellinger, a State Department legal adviser under Republican President George W Bush.
Also on Wednesday, Republicans on a US Senate committee pushed through the approval of Trump's Treasury nominee Steven Mnuchin and Health and Human Services pick, Tom Price.
After Democrats boycotted committee votes on both nominees, Republicans changed the rules to approve the candidates without their votes.
Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions was also confirmed as Trump's attorney general, despite heated exchanges between Senate committee members.
But Senate Democrats managed to stall a confirmation for Trump's pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency by refusing to show up.

Rs. 868.33 m. approved for STF Peace Keeping missions
A Police Special Task Force (STF) contingent scheduled to leave for Peace Keeping missions this week received Rs 868.33 million approved by Cabinet to purchase small arms/ammunition, military, medical and other equipment requirements.
Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development, Sagala Ratnayaka had submitted the proposal to Cabinet.
The STF which had pledged to the United Nations through the Sri Lankan Permanent Representative to the United Nations (PRUN) to deploy close to 380 police officers to the UN Peace Keeping Operations. They would form the units of; Formed Police Unit (FPU), Police Guard Unit and the SWAT Team.
The United Nations had earlier informed that the STF would first have to deploy troops under the FPU before sending policemen to other units. This makes it necessary to purchase the equipment needed for the FPU as soon as possible.
The entire project had Rs 1.59 billion approved by Cabinet on 11 May 2016.
The costs were justified by Minister Ratnayaka who stated in the proposal that the estimated cost would be reimbursed by the UN under the Wet Lease Reimbursement System and 20 percent of the remuneration that would be paid to deployed troops is planned to be provided to the government of Sri Lanka.
The deployment of officers to peace keeping mission has often been cited to help the country earn more foreign exchange, improve the morale of the troops, to help further enhance the international reputation of the Sri Lankan Police Force and to provide an opportunity to work with international police forces to gain experience and knowledge.
Cabinet on 24 January also approved the purchase of equipment required for Sri Lanka Army troops deployed in Peace Keeping Operations in Mali. The proposal put forward by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the time asked that that government enter into a loan agreement with the Russian
Bank SBERBANK, to fund the purchasing of equipment required for the said troops.

Addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said that whatever can be done and should be done for the SAITM issue is with the judiciary. "Anyone can express their ideas freely," he said.
According to Dr. Bandara, if doctors commit any wrongdoing or violate any rule or regulation, the Sri Lanka Medical Council has powers to investigate them and cancel their registration.
No matter whether the doctors were passed out from a state or a private university, investigations are carried out whenever an issue arises.

A salute to Rata Viruvo
More than two million Sri Lankans are living abroad, of which around 1.5 million are working in regions and countries such as the Middle East, South Korea, Italy, Hong Kong and Singapore. They are expatriates who have gone abroad on a temporary basis and retain their Sri Lankan citizenship.
They regularly send funds back to their families in Sri Lanka. This has become the biggest foreign exchange earning avenue for the country, beating traditional exports and tourism. In fact, foreign remittances reached a record high last year with a total of Rs 1,054.5 billion being sent to the country by Sri Lankans working abroad.
This is an 11.11 percent increase from 2015 where the country earned Rs.949 billion in foreign remittances, according to the Ministry of Foreign Employment. Remittances now make up the single largest earner of foreign exchange into the country and in 2015 it comprised 66.56 percent of all foreign exchange earnings. This is a great achievement, but there is still room for improvement.
The authorities must be commended for their efforts to ensure that foreign job seekers go through the proper channels. It is only then that they can step in if the job contract is not honoured properly or various problems arise at the other end. The Foreign Employment Bureaus booth at the Bandaranaike International Airport (temporarily closed till April 6 due to airport repairs) is a good idea, because it helps identify anyone who has not followed the due registration process. It can seem like a hassle to travellers going on visitor visas to Middle East countries, but there is a need to identify and have a database of those going abroad for employment.
Tough action should be taken against rogue employment agencies which dupe job seekers as well as government agencies by providing false information. A list of approved job agents (as well as blacklisted ones) should be published in the newspapers in all three languages, the same way the Central Bank publishes a list of approved banks and financial institutions. Fortunately, authorities have been able to weed out many of the offending agencies.
The authorities should explore the possibility of sending only skilled workers, male or female. Although training is given to prospective domestic workers on some aspects of their job, it does not seem to be sufficient. They should identify jobs available for skilled persons and try to direct more people towards them. More training opportunities should be provided for those willing to learn a new skill, say, welding or repairing cars.
Language is another barrier that should be overcome. South Korea demands that everyone who comes there for work has a sufficient knowledge of their native language. Although there is no such rule in the Middle East, at least a rudimentary knowledge of Arabic will not go waste. Learning the host countrys main language should be made compulsory for all foreign job applicants  for example for Saudi Arabia it should be Arabic.
The overwhelming majority of foreign job seekers are women, which does create various problems in families and the entire society. The SLBFE and our missions abroad must negotiate more openings for our males in the Middle East and elsewhere. If we can send more skilled male workers and professionals such as engineers abroad, the country will earn more foreign exchange as they are better paid.
It is also time to end the over-reliance on the Middle East for foreign employment. Our authorities should explore job markets in many other developed and even emerging countries. The pay and facilities are much better in these countries. If more jobs are secured in developed countries, the authorities will be able to resolve another issue at least to some extent: illegal migration. If rich countries can open up their employment markets to the developing world, at least for those jobs which may not be so appealing to the domestic population, it could go a long way towards addressing the illegal migration issue. Governments should work closely with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in this regard.
Moreover, any new agreement signed with a host country must include built-in safeguards for protecting our citizens in any eventuality including harassment by employers, non-payment of salaries, denial of rights and arbitrary arrest and court cases. There should be a mechanism to provide immediate assistance to any Sri Lankan worker facing legal or other difficulties in a foreign land.
There should be more recognition and facilities for expatriate workers who toil for years to enrich their Motherland, beyond calling them Rata Viruvo (Foreign Employment Heroes). Even after working abroad for 10- years, the maximum duty free allowance they get is just US$ 1750 which is just about enough to buy a few household electronics and appliances. Expatriates who have worked abroad at least for 10 years at a stretch should be given a duty free permit to purchase at least a small city car. That is perhaps an apt gift for these Sri Lankans who give up the best years of their lives to earn for the country.

Sensational history, heartbreak and the big days coming up
February is upon us and a glance or two at the Coliseum program in Rome would feature the Gauls at pains to defy, their rulers...and win their freedom throughout the empire - this weekend on the 5th day of February, traditional rivals invoke similar sensations as Kandy line up to defend their league title against the might of Havelocks under lights...On paper its a league match that will decide the champions 2017.
Blessings and considerations for all our resident experts, especially those who predicted and prognosticated a titanic clash for the crown.
I am equally impressed and sufficiently inspired by the script for this final, most significantly the current form of the key factors on both sides that will keep that scoreline ticking. Dulaj Perera, Sharo Fernando, Hirantha Perera, Muthuthantri, Rahul de Silva, Niroshan, Chamara Dabare, Kevin Dixon ...will certainly be contemplating how to dismantle Havies in the sets and in the loose.... They will want to strike faster to the breakdowns and focus on turnovers, causing as much disruption to Kandy having the slightest chance of clean ball to activate their threes. The plan would be for Muthu to antagonize his opposite number and hit that loose ball at pace ...rip their ball and hunt the shape all game tackling with force to knock the ball carrier behind his gain line each time the opportunity presents itself.
Kandy will present their calmest face but harbour a few shudders playing under lights in Colombo ...as the defending champions and given their second round consistency in winning all the battles, the odds favour them.
Roshan Weeraratne at the base, Fazil if fit, will be the critical combination to secure good direction and a steady ship all thru the 80 mins ...but vital support from Danushka Ranjan, Gayan Weeraratne, Richie Dharmapala, Nigel Ratwatte and Vishwamithra Jayasinghe both in attack is oxygen for their survival. Coach Sean needs to hype his forwards boiler house so they break the Havies pack, out scrum them, out think and out wrestle them as well, just to ensure a result they can celebrate. Shehan Pathirana, Soyuru Anthony and Udangamuwa will have to up their work rate and clatter into the Havies at each turn not letting them get their breath or settle under the floodlights.
I imagine a heap of percentage high balls, some rib bruising impact tackling to thrill the fans in their thousands, who will be screaming for justice after their trek from the hills to sea level oxygen in the city by the sea.
All in all a battle of epic proportion and much significance to energise the most sedate of citizens to adrenaline charged super-fan kitted up and ready to rock!
Equal the sensational line up on the 5th at Havelock Park is the RBS 6 Nations starting on the 4th, with England hosting the traditional channel partner France @ Twickenham. France will adopt a hungry wolves stance and hope to please their fans who make the short trip across the channel with heavy heats and extra plonck.
England vs France for very little ....else apart from wishes and a fabulously full house to absorb an injury riddled England against an unpredictable French team, whose exploits off the field have coloured ardent judgement for the clash.
Can Dylan Hartley see the sense in not becoming a mugger, retain his captaincy and last the pace after his red card ban
Eddie Jones will be glum faced till the final whistle, knowing deep within the confines of his well travelled Aussie heart, that despite them being unbeaten in 2016..injury replacements are a shade shy on substitutes skill levels. how does one match the quality and impact of the Vunipolas and the Tuilangi, a Robshaw, and Haskell ...
Jones will look to Farrell, Hartley, Launchbury, Itoje Youngs and Daley to secure the reputation and get past this first outing.
The schools season just weeks from kickoff and unprecedented anticipation bubbling over among parents, Old Boys Associations, players and schoolboys ....it's going to be an absolutely huge requirement to survive the intensity and injury, manage the kids performance levels right through...
Adrenaline weekends at home all around the Singer league families warming up for this complex season...
I trust the the Schools Association will spend their most attention and budget on educating the dangerous use of steroids, supplements, creatine etc....so parents, players, school staff etc...Doctor Seevali Jayasinghe, Director General WADA will be happy to help and update the anti doping list which is comprehensive and vital to athletes surviving longer than the trainers or tennis shoes.
Responsible adults need to police this and control the presence of these horrid individuals and their links to create dependency among our children.
It's February and the last post of January all done ...my task is to thank all the rugby hearts for their support and interest.
Thank you for the time spent strolling through my yards.. and the confidence to share my 'rugbyisms ...hoping it all goes well and results step up as predicted.
The time has flown with determined purpose ...lets hope the rugby weekend sensations, both here and in Europe, have equal pace on the wings.
Cheers islanders ....!

SLFP members should support President: Acting Chief Minister
All the SLFP members should rally round the President instead of showing their powers, Western Province Acting Chief Minister Gamini Thilakasiri said.
He was addressing a press briefing at the office of Western Province Chief Minister in Colombo.
The Acting C|hief Minister said the SLFP members should work on winning the 2020 election and to set up a SLFP government.
We are not happy now being in a joint government, But there is no any other alternative, he said.
He said the SLFPers go to rallies of President Maithripala Sirisena or former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Rallies would not help to predict the election results. The election rally in Polonnaruwa held by Mahinda Rajapaksa at the last elections was participated by a massive crowd but he was defeated, he said.
President Sirisena would not take any decision inimical to the country, Thilakasiri said. The removal of Arjuna Mahendran from the Central Bank Governor position and taking the people's side at the lottery price issue were some examples," he said.
He said Mahinda Rajapaksa should assist the President instead of holding rallies to show off his powers.
The SLFP was able to muster only 95 seats while the UNP won 106 seats at the last election. Therefore, the SLFP joined the UNP to set up the government as they had no any other option, he said. If the previous government acted in right manner, the SLFP would not have been defeated. Dinesh Gunawardena, Bandula Gunawardane, and Wimal Weerawansa made statements that led to the defeat of the then SLFP government, he said.
The previous government had a Super Minister and it was Basil Rajapaksa. He acted on his own. When this government brought the Development (Special Provisions) Bill, they also attempted to introduce a super minister.
Government servants stage protests because they know that the country now has good governance government.

Solar cells for low income families
Soorya Bala Sangramaya is to provide free solar cells for low-income families, Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
Minister Siyambalapitiya pointed out this revolutionary plan will be a turning point in Sri Lankas sustainable energy generation.
He said the Green Climate Fund is to facilitate the project together with the Electricity Board at present.
Minister Siyambalapitiya pointed out, the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy is to introduce this program since the low-income families were reluctant to invest in net metering and net accounting methods introduced by the Sooriya Bala Sangramaya, due to their serious financial difficulties.
In this method, the low-income families need not spend any money to fix a solar cell on their rooftops. They only have to come to a written agreement with the Electricity Board and the company which is providing them a solar cell. Minister Siyambalapitiya pointed out.
The low income families who have provided their rooftops for this project will not have to pay their electricity bill for five years, Minister Siyambalapitiya said.
Add to this, the rooftop lender will receive a monthly payment, at least a minimum of Rs.500 for their given out space, he also said. When the agreement is over, the rooftop lenders will receive the half of the income generated by the solar cell, Minister Siyabalapitiya added.
Minister Siyabalapitiya invited private investors to join hands with this project.

Tiger Woods: US must 'unite'

One of the most famous people in the US, Tiger Woods is urging his compatriots to "unite" during some turbulent times the country has arguably been recently experiencing.
Woods urged Americans to "come together and do what's best for our country," the former world No. 1 golfer told CNN's Living Golf in Dubai.
Woods was talking in the aftermath of President Trump's controversialimmigration ban, which has caused ructions in the US and throughout the rest of the world.
Trump's order has suspended the US refugee system for 120 days, suspended the Syrian refugee program indefinitely, and banned entry from seven Muslim countries -- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen -- for 90 days, among other things.
"We need to unite, and be Americans," said Woods, whoplayed golf with the then president-electin December.
"I know there is a lot of divisiveness as of right now but time, patience and unity I think will win out."
'Not funny'
The 41-year-old, who makes his second appearance of the year in Dubai this week, feared he would never play golf again during "dark times" as he recovered from multiple back surgeries in late 2015.
"It was a tough, tough road," said Woods, who returned to golf in December after 15 months out. "There was a lot of dark times where I couldn't get out of bed, couldn't move, the pain was too great.
"Anyone who's ever had nerve pain in their back, they certainly understand what that feels like. I honestly didn't know this time last year, I didn't know if I'd ever play golf again. Just because of the fact that it's nerve pain."
Woods has also missed several spells for knee surgery, notably after winning the last of his 14 major titles in 2008.
"You know, I've had a damaged knee, I've had a few operations on the knee, give me that any day of the week," he said.
"I'd rather have that every day and deal with that pain than deal with nerve pain. It's like hitting your funny bone a thousand times a day. It becomes not so funny."
'No pain'
Woods is playing this week's Dubai Desert Classic on the European Tour, his second tournament in a row after missing the cut on his 2017 season-opener in California last week.
The Californian says he was rusty at Torrey Pines in what was only his second event back, following December's Hero World Challenge.
But he is unconcerned what people think about his technique, which has undergone various reincarnations over the years to accommodate his injuries.
"I just play away from pain, it's very simple," said Woods. "Whatever that swing looks like, if it looks awful, then fine, I don't care.
"If it looks like Jim Furyk, that's fine, too," added Woods, referring to the Ryder Cup captain whose unconventional swing has been likened to an "octopus falling out of a tree," among other things, though it has netted him a US Open and 17 PGA Tour wins.
"As long as I don't have pain, I can play."

Chasing records
Woods insists his competitive fire burns just as fiercely, despite his advancing years and his time away from the game.
"That hasn't changed," he said. "That part is still there. I just need to get to where I'm playing enough tournament rounds to hit tournament shots. Hitting shots with your buddies back home is not the same as hitting tournament shots."
Woods is also scheduled to play the Genesis Open in California (February 16-19) and the Honda Classic in Florida (February 23-26) as he builds up to a return to Augusta for the Masters in April.
He won the last of his four green jackets there in 2005, but has had seven top-six finishes in his nine appearances since then.
Woods has won 79 PGA Tour titles, second only to Sam Snead's record of 82, but none since he clinched five wins in 2013.
He remains four major titles behind Jack Nicklaus' record of 18.

Tokyo 2020 asks public to donate old phones for medals
Tokyo: Tokyo Olympic organisers on Wednesday called on the Japanese public to donate old smartphones and other old electronic devices to help make medals for the 2020 Games.
In a push to give the Olympics an environmentally friendly hue, Tokyos organising committee is aiming to collect eight tonnes of gold, silver and bronze at recycling bins across Japan from April, officials said, to make 5,000 Olympic and Paralympic medals.
Tokyo 2020 said e-waste such as digital cameras, laptops and games units can also be donated at collection boxes in more than 2,000 stores of mobile phone giant and Olympic sponsor NTT Docomo.
Recycled metals have been used in previous years to make Olympic medals, including in Rio last year where the silver and bronze medals were 30 percent made from recycled materials.
An Olympic medal is one of the most coveted items in existence, American two-time Olympic decathlete champion Ashton Eaton said.
People spend decades, often agonising ones, working to obtain one, he added.
Organisers insisted they would look to keep costs as low as possible with Tokyos preparations for the Games plagued by concerns over soaring prices.
Experts had warned the total Games budget could hit an eye-watering $30 billion -- four times the initial estimate and almost triple that of the 2012 London Olympics.
In response, organisers unveiled a streamlined budget of just under $17 billion in December. Officials will be hoping for smoother progress in the run-up to 2020 after a series of embarrassing gaffes since beating Madrid and Istanbul in the race to host the Olympics.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe scrapped plans for the main stadium in July 2015 over its $2 billion price tag.
Claims of plagiarism then forced them to ditch the Olympic logo, before French prosecutors launched an investigation into how Tokyo won its bid. Japanese Olympic officials deny any wrongdoing. AFP

In the chaotic aftermath of US President Donald Trumps controversial immigration ban, 71 individuals from 20 countries including Sri Lanka were detained at New Yorks John F. Kennedy International Airport on Tuesday, Asian Correspondent said today.
According to the No Ban JFK, a coalition of volunteer attorneys camped out at JFK, those detained include a Malaysian and a Chinese national, as well as travellers from Turkey, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, France, Algeria, Jordan, Qatar, Senegal, Switzerland, Algeria, Egypt and Guinea, which were not on the US travel blacklist.
Others in the lawyers list released on social media include travelers from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan and Libya, five of the seven countries named in Trumps ban. The remaining two are Yemen and Somalia. Camille Mackler, Director of Legal Initiatives at the New York Immigration Coalition (NYIC), pointed out in a statement that the detentions prove the ban affects more than just the seven targeted countries.

Waiting in the wings
For all intents and purposes, the main parliamentary opposition to the government has come from the group calling itself the Joint Opposition within the parliamentary group elected from the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) at the August 2015 general election.
Last week, the JO took an enormous political step: it held a rally in Nugegoda where the main drawcard was former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. This was the JOs way of signalling to the government that a challenge was imminent, more so in the wake of Rajapaksas announcement that he would move for a change of government in 2017.
The publicity machine of the JO was out in full force. Arrangements were made to telecast the rally using live streaming over the internet. There was no danger of a poor crowd turnout: parliamentarians representing the various electorates were entrusted with the task of bringing in the numbers from their constituencies. To be fair, the rally did arouse genuine interest and a sizeable section of the general public was present despite the inclement weather, whatever their political persuasions were.
The JO hails the rally as a huge success. However, it must also know that numbers at public meetings do not necessarily translate into votes at elections. If they have any doubt about that, they only need to ask the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP).
Misusing state property
The Nugegoda rally did have its high points. The speech of Jathika Nidahas Peramuna (JNP) leader Wimal Weerawansa aroused much interest, not so much for its content but for the logistics that went in to its production.
Weerawansa is currently incarcerated at the Welikada prison on charges of misusing state property. Last week, he made a speech while he was in Parliament, which he is entitled to attend. This speech was obviously made with the intention of broadcasting it at Nugegoda and that is exactly what happened. No one can fault the JO for being short of inspiration!
The highlight of the evening though was former President and now Kurunegala district parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa. He made a grand entrance to rousing cheers and chants of handing back the country to the king. There was great interest in what he would say.
Rajapaksa was careful not to vilify President Maithripala Sirisena. He would go only so far as to say, tongue in cheek, that he owed his return to politics, despite a wish to retire from public life, to President Sirisena. Apart from that barb, his criticism was directed mostly at the government in general and if at all to the United National Party (UNP) faction of the government.
Rajapaksa criticised the governments policies, claiming that state resources were being sold off to foreign interests. He also criticised moves to amend the Constitution arguing that the government appeared to have forgotten its election pledges to abolish the Executive Presidency. References were also made to the Central Bank bond sale, a slogan echoed by speaker after speaker at the rally.
Separate parliamentary group
It was Mahinda Rajapaksa at his rhetorical best. If a startling revelation or an important declaration from the former President was anticipated, that did not materialise. And that begs the question, where to from here, for the JO
It will be recalled that the JO held similar meetings at Hyde Park and at Kirulapone to consolidate their identity as a separate parliamentary group. Those meetings too were hailed as successes in terms of crowd attendances but thereafter, the enthusiasm for decisive action seemed to have fizzled out.
Therefore, the next strategy of the JO depends on the numbers it carries in Parliament and the options available to it, in terms of the Constitution. This is what the thinks tanks in the JO will be pondering over in the coming weeks.
Of course, in the meantime, it can gear itself for local government polls but the reality is that, even if it posts a creditable performance at these elections, it will not be alter the balance of power in the country. The same holds true for provincial council elections, some of which are due this year. At best, these could be barometers of public opinion and little more than that.
In Parliament, the JO commands 52 of the 95 seats under the UPFA banner. That leaves President Sirisena with 43 seats. Given that the UNP commands 106 seats, the President will be able to command the support of 149 seats- just one short of a two-thirds majority- in Parliament. As the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) has one seat of its own, even a two-thirds majority is possible.
In real terms then, for the JO to aspire to form a government, they need to muster the support of at least all the UPFA MPs and then obtain the support of a further eighteen parliamentarians, presumably from the UNP. This would involve engineering defections from the UNP.
The number of defections needed from the UNP would increase if all of the UPFA MPs do not support Rajapaksa. This is also likely to be the case as there will be at least a few dozen MPs who are ideologically opposed to the Rajapaksa style of politics and will stay loyal to President Maithripala Sirisena, no matter what. Rajapaksa is an astute politician and is a past master at cross-overs. He successfully snared many an UNPer with the offer of ministerial portfolios. Indeed, some of his staunchest supporters- the likes of Gamini Lokuge, Johnston Fernando and Keheliya Rambukwella- were UNP strongmen in their respective districts before they were poached by Rajapaksa. The JO obviously believes they could make history repeat itself.
There is however a notable difference in the political equation. Rajapaksa enticed UNPers on to his side when he was the all-powerful Executive President and could dole out ministerial positions at will. Now he is an opposition parliamentarian aspiring for power- and he will never be the President because the Constitution bars it. In the best case scenario, he can only become Prime Minister and even then he will not have the final say on ministerial positions. Besides, the UNP is now in power and many of its members already hold positions of responsibility.
To woo UNPers to endorse Rajapaksa therefor is a tall order. That is why the JO, for all the public display of its perceived political strength, will have to devise an alternative political strategy if it is to cling to its dream of returning to power. Unfortunately for the JO, the Constitution also bars a general election until four and half years of the span of the present Parliament has elapsed, so forcing a poll is also not an option.
Limited options
In the near future then, the JO is realistically faced with limited options. The most it can do is to muster its resources as best as it can and compete in the Local Government and Provincial council elections. If it is able to register a creditable performance at these polls, it must then hope that it can keep that momentum going until 2020- when national elections are due.
Three years hence is however a long time in politics. There are bound to be many changes in the interim. These could include constitutional changes which may or may not suit their agenda. Also, Rajapaksa, although fighting fit now, would be nearly seventy five years of age then.
The mainstream SLFP and the UNP are both aware that while the possibility of the JO capturing power is not imminent, they do pose a threat to the governments popularity by constantly highlighting its shortcomings and blunders. That is as it should be in a democracy. Mindful of these implications, there has been discussion at the highest levels of government about the possibility of a Cabinet reshuffle. While that may ruffle the feathers of some ministers, it may also strengthen the resolve of the partners in the National Unity government to work together until the end of their term.
It has already been an interesting first few weeks to the year- and the dynamics of Sri Lankan politics are such that there will be an even more absorbing contest in the months to come.

## Title: What is Halal  Certified Food
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Finance

What is Halal  Certified Food
Halal food, Halal ingredients, Halal certified restaurants; the term halal is commonly used in day to day contexts. The term itself has caused much controversy, even in Sri Lanka mostly because of a lack of proper understanding.
The term halal is an Arabic word meaning things or actions, lawful, permitted or allowable in Islam.In terms of food production this covers a wide scope, which includes the entire production of a food item, from the raw materials used to the processing, packaging and delivering.
Throughout the years, global acceptance of Halal certified products and the demand for halal food has seen phenomenal rise. This is mainly because Halal certification has i) afforded the Halal conscious consumers the comfort that the Halal certified product has met the Halal quality standards and ii) made food producers realize that it is a practical and genuine way to attract local and international Halal conscious consumers.
A Halal certification ensures that Haram materials are not used in the entire production and supply chain of the product certified as Halal. These Haram materials  materials prohibited and not allowed in Islam  include pig and all its by-products, alcoholic drinks and other intoxicants, carrion (dead animals) or animals improperly slaughtered, blood and blood by-products, human body parts, reptiles, rodents and insects, hazardous and poisonous substances, carnivorous animals and birds of prey, amongst other things.
Swine and its by-products, used mainly as meat and in the production of gelatine, are also used in the production of soap, cosmetics, glycerine, and certain medicines. Carrion or carcass of dead animals isused to manufacture of collagen used in the production of sausage casings, and gelatine used in yoghurt, jelly. Alcoholic beverages are used in food preparation such as cake, ice cream and chocolates. L-Cysteine obtained from human hair and bird feathers are used as a food additive in the baking industry and preparation of savoury flavour. Insects such as Cochineal (Carminic Acid -E120) are used to produce natural food colouring.
The examples referred to above clearly show how these non-Halal materials get into various products, which will render the product not Halal for the Halal conscious consumer. The normal packaging material of products will not display such details for easy recognition of Halal conscious consumers.
To determine Halal status, Halal certificate holders must ensure that prohibited raw materials are not used in any of the processing methods and technologies used by them. Some of the processing methods are usage of enzymes (in cheese processing), gelatine as clarifying agent (in clear fruit juice production) and activated carbon in the purification process (used carbon in edible oil production).
Further, they must also ensure that the processing aids used do not contain any Haram substances. Processing aids are hidden ingredients used during production such as releasing agents, lubricants, filtering agents, anti-foaming agents, firming agents, de-colorizing agent etc. These substances are not disclosed in the ingredients list of products and therefore, consumers would have no knowledge of what substances are used. As such as there will be contamination of non-Halal with Halal rendering the final product as non-Halal.
The other two very important aspects of Halal certification are prevalence of cleanliness and prevention of cross contamination. A Hhalal certified processing plant is required to maintain high standards of hygienic practices namely sanitation and cleanliness. For example, all workers involved in the production process required to maintain cleanliness of hands, nails, prevent hair from falling into food etc.
Halal certified facilities must ensure they practise good storage and food preparation practises. Any raw material or ingredients that expired its shelf live shall not be used in any stage of the processing. Thus, Halal certification provides consumers the comfort and assurance that the final product is both devoid of any non-Hhalal materials and any cross-contamination.
The process of obtaining a Halal certificate is no easy task, as the applicant for Halal certification shall be extensively assessed to make certain they have the commitment and ability to meet all Halal standards before deciding to approve the applicant for awarding Halal certificate for their products.
After awarding Halal certificate the certificate holder will be subject to several surveillance audits to ensure continuous compliance of Halal standards and for reinforcing assurance of Halal integrity. The referred to surveillance audits shall be both announced and unannounced periodic audits.
The Halal certificate is usually valid for one year and has to be renewed on or before the expiry date.
There prevails some misunderstanding in that Halal food is only for Muslims. On the contrary these are only food permissible to be consumed by Muslims and not special products reserved for Muslims. Another misconception is that Halal food items are devoted to god/s. Halal food is meant for human consumption and is not left at any altar as an offering to God.
Some say that Halal certification is an attempt to divide society. In fact, the certification attempts to facilitate the right of all people to exercise their free will in purchasing the product of their choice. Besides, it gives even non-Muslim owned food processing units and food outlets the ability and opportunity to serve the needs of Muslim consumers.
Halal Accreditation Council (Guarantee) Limited (HAC) is a duly registered, not for profit organisation conducting Halal certification under the able stewardship of eminent professionals and business persons of Sri Lanka and further guided by well-reputed erudite theologians. HAC is ISO 9000-2015 certified by Sri Lanka Standards Institution as having a reliable quality management system. HAC certificates are recognized and accepted by most of the reputed Halal certification bodies in the world as it hold membership in the World Halal Food Council. Hence, HAC humbly takes pride of its unblemished credentials.
In conclusion, it can be rightly said that HAC Halal certification is a worthy value addition to a Halal product.

W.Indies Russell gets year ban for doping breach
Sydney: Globetrotting West Indian all-rounder Andre Russell has been banned from all cricket for a year over a doping code violation, his Australian Twenty20 club said on Wednesday.
The 28-year-old did not file his whereabouts on three occasions in 2015 as required, which constitutes a failed drugs test under World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) guidelines.
His punishment was handed down by the Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission on Tuesday.
"We are devastated for Andre, said Sydney Thunder general manager Nick Cummins, in confirming the outcome.
We haven't seen the written judgement, but given the circumstances surrounding the filing failures we thought he had a good chance of being exonerated.
"We will monitor the appeals process and assess our options."
Under WADA's whereabouts rules, elite athletes must supply details of where they will be for one hour each day to facilitate drug tests.
Russell played the first five games of the Big Bash League this year for Thunder before withdrawing due to injury and being replaced by international teammate Carlos Brathwaite.
Sydney Thunder director of cricket Mike Hussey said he felt for Russell.
"I feel for him. He's been going through a really tough time of late with all the 'whereabouts' saga going on and he's been waiting to hear the finding of that hearing, Hussey told the Cricket Australia website.
"I want him to go away and get better physically but also mentally." AFP

Alahapperuma's allegation baseless: Ajith P. Perera
Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera yesterday thumbed down Joint Opposition (JO) MP Dullas Alahapperuma's allegation that the new Smart-Meter production factory at Bandaragama, only a reopening.
The Deputy Minister said Alahapperuma, who has a good reputation as a politician, has now fallen prey to dirty politics.
Perera said that according to Alahapperuma, the foundation stone laying of this factory was done by the former Prime Minister, but contradictory to the allegation, it was Minister Siyambalapitiya, who laid the foundation stone on January 5, 2016.
The Deputy Minister said he was not sure as to how Alahapperuma got Minister Siyambalapitiya mixed up with the ex-PM.
Perera requested Alahapperuma not to make cheap statements about a Rs. 200 million worth project and the local engineers that provide service to this factory.
He said Alahapperuma should not be fooled by his disciples by feeding him wrong information.
MP Alahapperuma is talking about the factory opened in 2007 as a one to produce electromagnetic meters currently used by the Electricity Board, Perera said.
The recently opened Smart-Meter factory and the electromagnetic meter factory are in the same vicinity and owned by the same company, Lanka Electricity Company (Private) Limited (LECO), Perera said.
He said some Alahapperuma disciples must have provided him with photographs showing the inauguration of that factory opened in 2007 to back the allegation.
The Smart-Meter factory was recently opened by Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjit Siyambalapitiya as a step towards the vision A National Smart Grid'.
The factory in Bandaragama is to produce smart-meters, which do not need a meter reader to check and write down the electricity bill. The meter can automatically calculate the units and update itself when the payment is done.
The Deputy Minister said the government is to replace all the electromagnetic meters amounting upto a 60 million with smart-meters by the next five years.
The high tech Smart-Meter factory will provide around 500 job opportunities as well, Perera said. It would be a pride to have a Made in Sri Lanka smart-meter, he said.
LECO Chairman Lal Gunasekara said their company holds 70 percent shares of the Smart-Meter factory. He said the factory was opened by Minister Siyambalapitiya this January with a new building, new equipment, and new staff and that it was not a reopening.

Apple beats  expectations with  78.3 million iPhones sold
Apple exited 2016 like a lion, as the company posted record-setting iPhone sales while broadly beating Wall Street expectations for holiday season performance.
The company set a quarterly revenue record of $78.4 billion  beating predictions that hovered around $77 billion and generating earnings per diluted share of $3.36. Net sales were ultimately up nearly 3.3 percent from the same quarter a year ago.
iPhone sales, bolstered by the launch of the iPhone 7 in September, clocked in at a record 78.3 million for the quarter ending Dec. 31.
That narrowly beat out the 74.8 million phones sold between October and December 2015. The company's flagship smartphone accounted for nearly 70 percent of its revenue. On an earnings call Tuesday afternoon, CEO Tim Cook also praised the company's record-setting Apple Watch sales and said there had been positive customer reception to its wireless AirPod headphones.

Cabinet this week approved a bill which would amend the Prevention of Crimes Ordinance to allow the police (through a court order) to keep under supervision an accused in a case of a suspended sentence, if he has a proven previous conviction until the expiry of the suspended sentence.
The proposal made by Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe will be gazetted soon and presented to Parliament for approval. The amendments also sought to make provisions in the Ordinance to obtain fingerprints for new offenses by including them in the relevant schedule.
At present fingerprints can only be obtained regarding offences which are already listed in the Ordinance.
The Minister in his proposal had also stated that his predecessor in 2014 had also submitted a proposal to amend the Ordinance to allow those accused in new crimes to be fingerprinted before the trial. He explained in the Cabinet memorandum that the need to amend the Ordinance had risen as the gravity of new crimes included in the legislation needed to have those accused fingerprinted to confirm their identity and facilitate their supervision.

Breaking walls within
Nita Fernando is one of the most well-respected and well-known actresses in the Sri Lankan film industry.
Outstanding Personalities features Nita Fernando an experienced, vivacious and congenial lady.
You were awarded the Best Actress Award at the 1998 Singapore International Film Festival. You were awarded the Presidential Award for Best Actress (1999) and the Critics Award (1998). You were also awarded the OCIC Award for Best Actress (1999) among many. What enabled you to reach such heights
People appreciate my acting and I lived in the character. I did what the directors wanted. I had an appeal to the audience. I was appreciated for the roles I played. I simply did what the character demanded.
What issues in life do you take up
My film Swara is about HIV/AIDS. It has not been released yet. AIDS is a big problem in society and it is hidden. It is an educational film which touches on how you live with AIDS. And if you are not a person with AIDS, how you avoid it. And how people with AIDS can live their lives like normal people. For others, it is a lesson to prevent. It touches on how to be mindful about blood transfusion. In marriage, there should be a law where both parties check for AIDS. AIDS is spread through blood and sex. The main thing is to educate people to go for checkups. People who take drugs may carry AIDS through the sharing of needles. This is about educating and it is an educational film.
What is it like to be a woman in the film industry in Sri Lanka
Character-wise, once you establish yourself, you get the character that they expect you to do. So we are selected to do certain characters. If you are happy with the character and if you can work with the director, then it is fine. But there is of course competition among women and men. So jealousy can affect you. The main problem in the industry is jealousy and gossip. Because of the internet, it is getting worse. People who surf the net believe that others should not have a personal life. Information Technology is killing a persons private life. There is unnecessary gossip which most often is not true. Unnecessary gossip and mudslinging can kill someones reputation. That is the sad thing. Everyone has the right to have a personal life. I think this is there all over the world. The film industry has more opportunity for jealousy than any other industry. But you have to be straightforward and tell the truth. I find that truth may hurt, but truth wins in the end. In Sri Lanka, we have an intelligent audience, who are not worried about other peoples private business. They appreciate a persons skills and talents and love you. Our lives become everyones business! So you have to be very careful about your behaviour and maintain a good reputation, and that is not easy.
You studied at Holy Family Convent, Wennappuwa. Were there signs during your formative years that you would become famous
At school, I loved all the dramas and going up on stage. From my small days, I loved to show off. Whenever there was a drama or a concert, I was there. My house was next to the convent. So during the school holidays, I went there and did a little dance, and showed them how I can dance. I didnt think about being famous, but I loved to show off.
After marrying Elian Perera, you moved to Canada where you worked as a receptionist at the Montreal General Hospital. Was this a tough decision Was it a tough transition from actress to receptionist
After joining my husband in Canada, I was in the x-ray department, the main reception. I was there for 18 years and I worked as a telephone operator, and I learnt a lot handling appointments. After three or four years, I became the senior there. Then I became the supervisor. I had to learn French, so I had to go for lessons in the cold weather and it was not easy. It was completely different from Sri Lanka. No one knew who I was, so I had to go for lessons and then cook and clean. But my husband supported me 100 percent. Most of the time, it was cold there. Whether you like it or not you have to sweep the snow in front of the house since you have to get in the car and drive to work. And when you come back, the snow is piled up again in front of your house. After one or two years, I got used to it. Depending on how hard you work, the results are there. You learn a lot and how to respect other people. Of course, I missed Sri Lanka very much. A few people called me to come back and do some films, but I could not take leave because I was new there.
You made your screen debut in Landaka Mahima alongside the legendary Joe Abeywickrama. How old were you then and how did that impact you What kind of influence did that have on you and your acting
He was a genius. I learnt to relax and act. Just by looking at him I learnt, and did not have to exert myself to act. He was very kind and nice, and he was very good. I was very lucky I started my career with a genius like Joe Abeywickrama. I learnt how to behave and how to act. I learnt how to face the camera without exaggerating or overacting.
You have been part of over 40 films. From those films, what really stands out to you What made your name What is most memorable to you
I would count Lasanda, Hadawath Naththo, Duhulu Malak, Shanthi, Suriyakantha and Pawaru Walalu. In addition, I must emphasize that people liked a lot of the commercial films. I would say that Duhulu Malak really made me famous. But I was not in Sri Lanka to watch some of my films. But people talk and most of my good films, up to now, I have not seen on screen. My film Swara is waiting to be released but I do not know when. I have produced Pawaru Walalu, Suriyakantha and Nisala Giri. Nisala Giri is about the drug problem. I partially directed Swara and Theja.
Your first film role was in Gamini Fonsekas Parasathu Mal
No, No! That is a lie! I was never in Parasathu Mal! I was in school at that time! That is absolutely false news!
Pavuru Walalu propelled you to international acclaim. Can you comment on this great milestone in your life
I won an international award, competing with Iranian films which were good films. It went on Australian television, and then it went to Malaysia. There is a copy in the Japan Archives. I really liked it, because my husband produced it for me. Prasanna Vithanage did a fantastic job. The theme was about a woman who faces difficulties in life. The film brought out the stark realities of life and the human condition. It highlights the frailties of society. I am very happy about it.
What are your latest involvements in film What are you doing at the moment
I am waiting for my three films to be released. They are Swara, Theja and Swaroopa with Dharmasene Pathiraja.
What are your future expectations, plans and dreams
I have no dreams, but I want to be in this film industry playing the characters I want to do. I like doing this very much. As long as the audience accepts me as a good actress, I like to keep on playing good characters.
What strengthens you and sustains you in your career
Confidence in myself. I dont give up easily. If I know I am doing the right thing, I go for that. I dont do unnecessary things and do wrong. So you learn. You have to learn through your mistakes.
What is your message to the youth
I have no message to the youth really. Because now the youth is more intelligent than us now! But we also have made mistakes when we were young. I think the youth are much more forward and more knowledgeable than us. When it comes to the film industry, there are so many youths who are good actors and actresses. I wish them the best of luck!
To what do you attribute your success to
I was lucky to play characters that keep me going until now.
Which personalities have influenced you in life
My husband was the biggest influence in my life other than my mother and father. I have a good friend in my friend Yolanda. She encourages me and she gives me strength.

Breast cancer, most common among Sri Lankan women
According to the National Cancer Registry 2010, the overall crude incidence rate of cancer in Sri Lanka was 82.1 and the age standardised incidence rate was 87.5 per 100,000 population. Breast cancer is the most common accounting for 26.8 percent of all cancers among females, Health Services Acting Director General Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said.
He was addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday to mark the World Cancer Day, which falls on February 4.
He said the second leading cancer type in Sri Lanka in 2010 emerges in lip, oral cavity, and pharynx with an age standardized incidence of 12.7 per 100,000. It is the commonest cancer among males which accounts for 24 percent of the total number of male cancers.
Breast, uterine, cervix, thyroid gland, oesophagus, and ovary cancers are five leading types among females. Among males, lip, oral cavity and pharynx, trachea, bronchus and lungs, oesophagus, colon, and rectum and lymphoma lead the other types, he said.
Everyday, around seven new breast cancer incidences and two cervical cancers are reported in Sri Lanka. Leading a overall healthy life is what helps prevent from having cancers, he said.

CARE to SHARE : Organ donation, saving lives
Despite widespread need for donor organs in Sri Lanka, the nation has a long way to go when it comes to improving the rate of organ donation and transplant. Recently, Cabinet approved a proposal put forward by the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine to include information on whether a person is a donor or not in his/her Drivers license. The proposal if implemented would provide hospital authorities with vital information in the event of an accident.
These proposals come in the midst of Sri Lanka increasingly having the need for a national transplant programme to meet the existing demand for organs, said Transplant Surgeon at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL), Dr Ruwan Dissanayake.
He further noted that as a country that has great potential for organ transplant, we should consider the number of possible options for improving organ donation systems and expand the amount of organs available for transplant options.
Need for a proper transplantation system
According to Dr. Dissanayake the lack of a proper system to coordinate organ transplant was a huge problem faced by the medical community.
Health statistics show that annually more than 2,000 people die due kidney failure. Nearly 1,700 die due to Cirrhosis or advanced liver disease; this statistic is limited to state hospitals. In that context more than 4,000 people die every year due to liver and kidney failure alone in this country. The medical community considers this as one of the biggest health problems that needs to be immediately addressed.
The only lasting solution for such diseases is an organ transplant which will give the patient a second lease on life, said Dr. Dissanayake.
At present the most common manner of organ donation is through live donors and he said there were eight kidney transplant centres attached to national hospitals in the country with nearly 400 transplants done every year.
When more than 2,000 people are dying due to kidney failure, only 400 transplants are conducted. We have a problem even though Sri Lanka has high potential to deal with the issue. We need to have a systematic organ transplant system, he said.
He added that liver failure was also another significant problem as Sri Lanka does not have an effective liver transplant programme.
Currently there are only two programmes pertaining to liver transplant and one is at the National Hospital in Colombo and the other is at the North Colombo Teaching Hospital. We have conducted nearly 10 public awareness programmes over the last five years, he said.
The main problem is that we are not effectively using the donors. There are a lot issues related to live donations; of which some are ethical, social and financial issues as well. The ethical issue here is you cant sell an organ, donation has to be a donation. Sri Lankan law does not allow to do that, he added.
Many countries, according to Dr. Dissanyake have overcome the problem by having almost 95 percent of organs being retrieved from brain dead donors.
When a patient dies in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) while being supported by ventilator and other drugs, the ICU doctors have to confirm brain death. There are a series of tests that they have to do and once they are done twice, the patient is legally declared dead. Then the ICU doctors can make an offer to the transplant teams in the hospitals. We have appointed transplant coordinators and they counsel the family and get the consent for organ retrieval. We promote this because its free of charge and then it can be allocated in a transparent manner, he said.
This system which is practiced in few hospitals is not an island wide programme as there is no national system in place.
We are trying to make it an island wide programme. Last year we organised a national conference and we established an inter connection between 81 ICUs around the country. The transplant coordinators attached to the National hospitals have contacts with all the ICUs and they notify them when there is a brain dead patient, he added.
Dr. Dissanyake said they were also trying to introduce a liver transplant programme as it was a costly service at the private hospitals.
The Ministry of Health is currently taking the necessary initiatives for it. There are national level transplantation programmes in foreign countries which are very effective. In the USA, its United Network of organ sharing (UNOS), in the UK its National Health Service Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) and in Australia its Donate Life. List of donors, recipients and all the details are included. A national programme would make the process much easier, he said.
Challenges pertaining to organ transplant process
With the development of science and technology organ and tissue transplant gives many benefits to patients. Living humans as well as brain dead or dead via circulatory death may donate organs if their willingness is declared earlier.
At present as there are no major programmes initiated, the medical officers who are interested in the transplantation field are involved in the process. Therefore, Dr. Dissanayake pointed out the need for awareness among medical officers as well as the public.
Creating awareness among people is not enough, it is also equally important to make the health care workers aware that they need to improve their knowledge on technical and scientific issues related to it. It is not easy to make people understand about brain death and the organ retrieval procedure, he said.
He further said that the administration has planned for a major awareness programme in 2017.
Meanwhile, he pointed out that no one had control over the ICUs when there was a brain death and it was simply coordination among the appointed transplantation coordinators.
In medical terms brain death and death were the same. When there was brain death, the organs functioned with the support of the machines. Though Sri Lanka was a nation open to donation, many family members were reluctant to accept the patient as dead when his organs continue to work with the use of machines.
If there is a national programme the health care workers will be obliged to contribute to the cause.
The relatives usually say that the patient is still surviving with the machines and that they are reluctant to give their consent but if there was a national programme, at least to a greater extent the problems pertaining to organ transplantation can be solved, he said.
Medical officers are always ready to provide the necessary service. There are necessary equipment, cold storage boxes and transportation facilities. Even if there is a call from Anuradhapura or Pollonnaruwa there are services to immediately address the problem, he added.
It is in such circumstances that the Cabinet decision to include organ donation information in the Drivers license has come into the fore, many drivers experience accidents that cause brain or circulatory death.
Dr. Dissanayake said that was a great achievement by the Health Ministry
Implementation of this process will promote organ donation. At present Sri Lankan law says the next of kin has to give consent for the donation to take place. That is the hardest thing to get. In some countries, the consent can be obtained over the phone, we dont have that, he said.
He further said starting a transplantation programme is not easy but added that the nation has got ample trained surgeons.
We have to establish a system first and Sri Lanka has potential for transplant. Ministerial level discussions are currently taking place.
This is not for the benefit of doctors, it is a public service. We need the support of every citizen, he added.
Medico  legal issues
In addition to the medical issues there are also medico  legal issues pertaining to organ transplant when retrieving organs from a brain dead person.
Colombo Chief Judicial Medical Officer, Dr. Ajith Tennakoon said organ transplantation in Sri Lanka was governed by Transplantation of Human Tissue Act  1987 and added that changes were needed to the Act to improve the service.
The Human Tissue Transplantation Act No. 50 of 1987 was introduced in the latter part of the twentieth century to regularise some aspects of tissue retention mainly in the direction of transplantation. The first Kidney transplantation was done in Sri Lanka in 1988 and many transplants have been done subsequently.
He further said that the legal documents describe how to get the consent, the eligible donors and also about the people who are authorised to retrieve the organs.
But Section 19 states, this Act shall be applied to inquiries held into death and that restricts the medical officers from retrieving organs from a brain dead person, said Dr Tennakkoon.
He further explained the main problem here is that many potential healthy organ donors are victims of violence and road trauma, where release of the bodies are subjected to an inquest followed by autopsy examination, under the provisions of the criminal procedure code.
The provisions of the criminal procedure code cannot be overruled by the transplantation Act. However, there is no legal bar for consented removal of the organs once the corpse is released after the autopsy. However, the medical community has to overcome the legal inconsistencies by mutual understanding between the transplant team and the JMO. The Ministry of Health issued a special circular in 2010 to deal with the issue.
We have made the JMO a part of the transplantation team. After the brain death is confirmed with the consent of the relatives the coroner will be informed. He has to give permission to do the autopsy in front of the JMO and submit the report, he said.
The law should incorporate what is currently being followed. The coroner should be empowered to grant permission and the JMO to go ahead with the organ transplantation process, he pointed out.
He noted that the law should be amended stating that the driving license was adequate for organ retrieval but if the next of kin refused to consent even after that, the doctors would face a great dilemma.
Dr. Tennakoon said once organ transplantation coordinators are appointed in every hospital, the problems would be relatively less but the system needed to be improved further.
Thus deceased donor organ donation from brain dead donors is a possibility in Sri Lanka according to the medical officers. However, there is no established donor organ donation service; the establishment of such a service may help save thousands of lives.

Where is the international arbitration centre
The present government which is keen on receiving direct foreign investments for the country, took a very positive step in this connection by establishing an International Arbitration Centre, at the World Trade Centre. It was launched under the name and style, Colombo International Arbitration Centre. The setting of this centre, was given a wide coverage through the print and electronic media.
The intention of establishing this centre was to encourage the investors who may have various disputes with the local collaborators to seek immediate remedies for their grievances. There are instances where local collaborators have misled foreign investors and the final result being the foreign investors bid farewell to Sri Lanka even after loosing much money and time. The court procedures in these matters take a very long time and foreign investors are reluctant to get involved in rigid court procedures as these measures hinder their movements. As a result of these obstacles some of the investors have left the island and if this trend continues, it will finally discourage probable foreign investors.
Although, the decision to establish an International Arbitration is a laudable idea and several months have passed since the first announcement, nothing has been done to implement this project. It was announced that this office will function on the 22th floor of the World Trade Centre with a well trained staff and it will function, under the purview of the Ministry of Justice. However, our inquiries have revealed that this office is not functioning now. For all practical purpose, it is closed now.
To encourage direct foreign investors, the country is in need of a device like this. The smooth functioning of this project will enhance investors confidence in our business affairs. If this is closed for unknown reasons, it is really a sad state of affairs.
Therefore, we call upon all responsible authorities, specially the Ministry of Finance to look into this matter immediately and to take positive steps in the right direction. The opening of this office, with a well trained staff should be expedited.
In developed countries, international arbitration centres have been effectively established to handle matters of disputes. The American Arbitration Association, International Centre for Dispute Resolution, The London Court of International Arbitration and the Hong-Kong International Arbitration Centre are some of the few which take up cases on behalf of foreign investors.

COYLE meets Minister Samarawickreme to discuss enterprise reforms
The Chamber of Young Lankan Entrepreneurs (COYLE) invited Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickreme to their monthly meeting held recently at The Kingsbury to discuss the implementation of a more realistic approach to economic growth by taking into consideration the concerns of the business community, which should be a priority for the nations leaders.
In his address, the Minister stated that the country's economic priorities also correspond with business interest. He stated that the Government has embarked on economic reforms that will accelerate growth and open up new business opportunities, which include positive steps to improve the business environment and enhance support for companies. To this end, he indicated that taking initiatives to enter into bilateral agreements with countries such as India, Malaysia, Singapore, China, Japan and Korea would open up opportunities for foreign investment business partnerships and in addition, the forthcoming restoration of the GSP+ would also be a boost to our export sector. In conclusion, he assured COYLE members of the services of his office and his availability to businessmen to iron out any issues faced by them.
COYLE Chairman Kasun Rajapaksa thanked the Minister for including COYLE for Stakeholder Consultations Committee on Trade in Services Liberalisation and for considering the proposals and suggestions made by the Chamber.
COYLE welcomed the moves taken to improve the economy, but stressed on the importance of implementing more business-friendly policies and infrastructure improvements for local entrepreneurs, as well as discussing issues related to the signing of FTA's with the business sector before finalization. This would avoid the Government and business enterprises being at cross purposes. The Chamber also re-iterated that it was imperative that the Sri Lankan Government send a strong and positive signal to current and future local investors, through smooth and expeditious resolution of the issues faced by these investors. Several COYLE members raised concerns about lack of standardization and controls over products being sold in the market hindering local businesses, duty free import permits to foreign investors in various sectors including the industrial sectors, which are affecting local investors who cannot compete and are pushed out of business.
COYLE continues to serve as a foundation for its advocacy efforts in dialoging with Government policy and decision makers with a view to enhancing business entrepreneurship and taking the country forward towards economic progress.

The issue of ceding Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka became a point of intense debate once again in the Tamil Nadu State Assembly on Tuesday with the Treasury and Opposition Benches wrangling over it. While winding up the debate on the Governors address, Leader of Opposition MK Stalin touched upon the plight of Tamil Nadu fishermen and questioned the status of a project relating to deep sea fishing.
Making an intervention, Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam said, The fishermens issue cropped up only after the ceding of Katchatheevu. He recalled that the late Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa had approached the Supreme Court to regain the island, which remains a bone of contention. Seeking to make a point, Deputy Leader of Opposition Durai Murugan said the Centre had ceded Katchatheevu without the knowledge of the then DMK government.
He also noted that Jayalalithaa had written to AB Vajpayee, when he was the Prime Minister, saying she had no issues with the ceding of the island.

The compartments of the Senkadagala Menike train from Kandy to Colombo got uncoupled from the engine near Pilimatalawa station and the driver of the train had driven the engine unaware for several kilometres before realizing the mishap.

FM orders to expedite investigation on seized timber
A large stock of timber was seized by Customs in 2014 while it was smuggled through Sri Lanka.
The illegal timber stock had been seized by the Customs during the previous regime, and no action has been taken with regard to the seizure for the past three years, denying the government its due penalty or proceeds from auctioning. Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake pointed out that the Customs Department should be held responsible for the liability.
The minister pointed out that by delaying the inquiry into the seized timber stock, certain officials of the Customs Department are trying to embarrass the government.
He pointed out that certain officers of the Customs Department are attempting to fuel the propaganda machines of the Joint Opposition led by a few politicians who are responsible for the ruin of this country. He said the negligence of Customs officers to deny investigation of the stock of smuggled timber for the past three years is evidence of their malicious intentions.
Karunanayake ordered the Director General of the Customs Department Chulananda de Silva on Monday to probe the incident extensively and submit a report.
The government led by the President and Prime Minister are taking measures to end corruption and other misappropriation in the country and if the Customs Department which comes under the purview of the Finance Ministry has disregarded legal procedures in connection with this incident, stern action will be taken against those responsible, he said.

The government is suffering from Rajapaksa phobia. Instead of beating the Rajapaksa name, it is high time for it to buckle down to some serious work for the benefit of this country, Kurunegala district parliamentarian and former President Mahinda Rajapksa said.
He was speaking to the media after he made a pilgrimage to Anuradhapura where he worshiped the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, Ruwanweliseya and several other places of worship and received blessings. Rajapaksa said the government was trying to resolve issues and problems by beating university students and taking them to court.
Problems could not be solved by sending them to remand prison on framed up charges. The government should have resolved the SAITM problem through discussion without remanding the students' Action Committee leader that carried out the protest. He said the SAITM was started during his rule. It was first started without their knowledge, and they were made aware of it after it became functioning.

Green light for SAITM
Putting an end to a long-held dispute, the Court of Appeal on Tuesday informed that medical degree holders of SAITM private university Malabe could register with the Sri Lanka Medical Council. Reproduced here are highlights from the landmark judgement.
Part I of this article appeared yesterday
Where the statute prescribed the manner in which the statutory power has to be exercised, the power must be exercised in that manner alone. If the exercise of power is in violation of section 19C of the Medical Ordinance (as amended) it cannot be regarded as an act done in pursuance of the Ordinance. If the administrative body created by the statute acts beyond the powers vested on the body by the statute such an act is ultra vires and the courts have a duty to quash it. In the said circumstances when the President SLMC replied the Petitioner stating that he has no hesitation or reluctance in vehemently resisting any legal action, without any legal basis under the Medical Ordinance (as amended) for doing so, and the subsequent conduct of the 151 Respondent SLMC when the Petitioner filed the present application before this court, and also the conduct of the 151.
Respondent as discussed above with regard to the recommendations reflected in the report, the paper notices issued and the two standards maintained when holding investigations at Degree Awarding.
As referred by me earlier in this judgement the 1st Respondent at the very commencement of the argument raised several preliminary objections to the maintainability of the present application. This court at that stage decided to consider those preliminary objections in the final order. Whilst discussing the grounds raised by the 1st Respondent in the main mater I have considered some of those preliminary objections as well.
In Jayalingam V. The University of Colombo CA application No 415/81, we find that the Petitioner in that case, who was an external student, asked for a writ of Mandamus on the University of Colombo to accept his application and permit him to sit the Final Examination in Laws, on the basis that it was the University that had the power to conduct external examinations for enabling those who are not students of the University, to obtain degrees of the University.
Learned Counsel for the Petitioners relied on the decision in Haniffa V. The Chairman, U.c., I I Nawalapitya (supra). In this case the Petitioner made the chairman, U.c., Nawalapitiya, the Respondent to his petition. He was not named Tambiah, J pointed out that the Chairman was not a juristic person; that even if the Chairman was a juristic person, since disobedience to writs of Mandamus is punishable as contempt of Court, a person who asks for a Mandamus to compel a public officer to perform a duty should name the public officer who holds the office. It is in this context, that Tambiah J said, 1 fail to see how we can issue a Mandamus on a juristic person.
In Pathirana V Gunasekara 66 NLR 464,467, Weerasooriya, S.PJ observed,
Where officials having a public duty to perform, refuse to perform it, Mandamus will lie on the application of a person interested to compel them to do so. The rule would also apply where a public body fails to perform a public duty with which it is charged.
Apart from this, the Petitioners presented their petition on the basis that the Respondents are the persons who are entrusted with the duty of carrying out the Obligation which was reposed in the University, to hold the 2nd MBBS examination for them only. At the time they were made Respondents, the 1st respondent held the office of Vice Chancellor by virtue of an appointment made by the Chancellor, and 2nd Respondent held the office of Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, by virtue of her election by the Faculty (Sections 34 (1) and 49 (1) of the Universities Act). Under the Emergency Regulation, they cease to hold their respective office. The 1st Respondent now holds the office of Vice Chancellor on an appointment made by the Minister (Reg. 3(2); the 2nd Respondent now hold office as Dean on an appointment made by the Vice Chancellor. It is now sought to compel the 1st Respondent to perform a duty on the Basis that he has, by reason of Regulation 4 (a), absorbed in himself all the powers and duties of the University. Would not all these result in a change in the character of the petition and in the 34 conversion of the original petition in to a petition of another kind What if the regulations are withdrawn tomorrow Then the argument of learned Counsel for the Petitioners, based on the Emergency Regulations, loses its validity.
In our view the proper body to be directed by a Mandamus, assuring that a writ can go is the University of Colombo and not the Respondents to this application.
In the case of the Government Registered Medical Officers Association and another V. Hon. John Senevirathne Minister of Health and four others CA Application 1498/2000 CA minute dated 24.02.2004 K. Sripavan J (as he was then) issued a writ of Mandamus directing the 4th Respondent Sri Lanka Medical Council to take steps in terms of law duly recognize the MD degree awarded.
Recently in the case of Ekanayake V. Attorney General and two Others CA Application 58/2012 (CA minute dated 25.04.2016) this court re affirm the position taken in the Abeydeeras case referred to above and observed that the law seems to have moved away. Today a juristic person, no less than a natural person, can be commanded to carry out its public duty and rejected the argument that Mandamus cannot lie against a public body such as the Sri Lanka Ports Authority.
When considering the decisions referred to above I see no merit in the said argument raised by the 1st respondent.
Failure to avail of an Appeal to the Minister
The 1st Respondent whilst referring to section 18 of the Medical Ordinance (as amended) raised this preliminary objection to the effect that, the Petitioner had failed to avail of appeal provided under the Medical Ordinance and thereby not entitled to come before this court in a discretionary remedy.
When considering the above provision of the Medical Ordinance it appears that the order or decision referred to above, will confine to a decision taken by SLMC acting within the frame work provided by the Medical Ordinance (as amended) and if the said SLMC had acted outside powers vested on SLMC we observe that there is an illegality taken place and in such a situation, it is the duty of this court to consider whether the statutory alternative is satisfactory or not.
This position was considered in the case of Somasunderam Vaniasinghem V. Forbes and another
[1993] 2 Sri LR 362 at 370 by Bandaranayake J as follow;
It may be that even though statute provides for an administrative appeal either to an administrative tribunal or a Minister the Court may not regard such an arrangement as impliedly excluding review if the applicant is entitled as a matter of law to have the order quashed as it is pointless then to have him pursue an administrative appeal on the merits. There is thus no rule requiring the exhaustion of administrative remedies.
A statutory remedy may be for a different purpose being usually an appeal on the merits whereas the ordinary discretionary remedy of review is for prevention of illegality.
In the said order Justice Bandaranayake further observed, (at page 371)
In this area of the law, where there is no illegality the court should first look in to the question whether a statute providing for alternative remedies expressly or by necessary implication excludes judicial review. If not, where remedies overlap, the court should consider whether the statutory alternative remedy is satisfactory in all he circumstances ... if not, the court is entitled to review the matter in the exercise of its jurisdiction. Of course if there is an illegality there is no question but that the court can exercise its powers of review.
As observed in this judgement, the SLMC had already acted beyond the powers vested on the SLMC under section 19C(i) of the Medical Ordinance (as amended) which act is ultra-vires and illegal and in the said circumstances, we observe that the Petitioner is entitled to come before this court by way of a discretionary remedy. We therefore see no merit in this preliminary objection. Petitioner failed to make a valid demand. As bserved in this judgement the Petitioner after obtaining the MBBS degree from SAITM a Degree Awarding Institute recognized under the Universities Act had visited the SLMC accompanied by an Senior Lecturer from SAITM Dr. Keerthi Attanayake to submit her application under section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance (as amended). At that stage the registrar of the SLMC who refused to accept her Application had refused to issue a letter to that effect and informed her,
a) The Minister of Health had already been informed by a letter from the President of the SLMC that students from SAITM were not registrable
b) The same was communicated publicly through several news paper advertisements.
The above position taken by the Petitioner was supported by an affidavit from the said Senior Lecturer Dr. Keerthi Attanayake and was not challenged by the 1st Respondent but in fact corroborated to the extent that the paper advertisement referred to above was produced marked 1R 20K with the statement of objection filed on behalf of the said Respondent.
In the said advertisement which was published on 11th November 2015 by order of the Council the Registrar had informed the public.
Accordingly based on the Report submitted by the team of inspectors the SLMC formulated an Official Report which was submitted to the Minister of Health on 04 September 2015 with the recommendation that THE DEGREE A WARDED BY SAITM SHOULD NOT BE RECOGNIZED FOR THE PURPOSE OF REGISTRATION UNDER THE MEDICAL ORDINACE.
As revealed from the documents filed before this court the Petitioner had sat for MBBS final Examination in May 2016 and she had been awarded with the MBBS Degree with effect from 30th May 2016 and visited SLMC to seek provisional Registration on 06.06.2016.
However as notified by the SLMC by the above advertisement the General Public was aware of the above notification, by 11th November 2015 and therefore acting on the above notification the Petitioner decided to demand the 1st Respondent to provisionally Registrar the Petitioner in the event she obtain a MBBS degree from SAITM a recognized Degree Awarding Institute on 10th March 2016. Even though the 1st Respondent had taken up the positions that, at the time the said demand was made, the Petitioner had not obtain a MBBS Degree, we see no merit in that argument for the reasons that at the time the Petitioner sent the said letter of demand she was well aware of the notification published in newspaper and was getting ready for her final examination which was scheduled for May 2016. Since the 1st Respondent did not responded to the letter dated 10th March a reminder was sent by the Attorney at Law on 4th April 2016 and the Attorney at Law representing the President of the SLMC had replied the said demand, by informing that any legal action would be vehemently resisted.
In these circumstances we are not inclined to accept the preliminary objection raised by the 1st Respondent.
Necessary party not before court.
In this regard the 1st Respondents argument was based on the failure by the Petitioner to name the Registrar SLMC as a Respondent to the present application.
Where a statute prescribed the manner in which the statutory power to be exercised the said power must be exercised in that manner alone and therefore one cannot argue that the functions entrusted by the Medical Ordinance with the Medical Council can be vested with the registrar, without any legislative provision in the said Ordinance.
The powers identified in section 20 of the Medical Ordinance (as amended) to maintain registers cannot be interpreted as powers vested with the Registrar under section 29 (1) and (2) of the said Ordinance.
In these circumstances we see a clear distinction between the powers vested with the registrar under section 20 and with the Medical Council under section 29 (1), (2) and therefore we see no reason to uphold the objection raised by the 1st Respondent.
Non-compliance of the Rules of the Court of Appeal (appellate procedure) Rules.
Whilst relying on Rule 3(1)(a) of the above rules the 1st Respondent had submitted that the Petitioner had failed to adhere to the above rule and therefore her application, should be dismissed in limine.
Rule 3(1)(a) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules which is relevant to the present objection reads as follows;
3 (1) (a) Every application made to the Court of Appeal for the exercise of the powers vested in the Court of Appeal by Articles 140 or 141 of the constitution shall be by way of a Petition together with an affidavit in support of the averments therein, and shall be accompanied by the originals of documents material to such application (or duly certified copies thereof) in the form of exhibits.
Where a Petitioners is unable to tender any such document he shall state the reason for such inability and seek the leave of court to furnish such document later. Where a Petitioner fails to comply with the provisions of this rule the court may, ex mere motu or at the instance of any party, dismiss such application.
As observe by this court, the parties to the present application had never complained of any failure from the petitioner to produce any document relevant when filling the present application before this court. As further observed by this court the majority of the documents filed by the Petitioner before this court are either letters exchanged between the parties, reports prepared by expert committees and submission submitted before such committees. In such a situation the Petitioner being a private party, will not be able to obtain originals of such documents to file before this court.
As further observed by this court, the said rule had also provided to submit duly certified copies but the rules are silent as to what is meant from the tenn Certified Copies.
Osborns Concise Law Dictionary described the term certified copy as, a copy of a public document, signed and certified as a true copy by the officer to whom custody the original is entrusted and admissible as evidence when the original would be admissible.
According to the above interpretation a certified copy can only be issued with regard to a public document and the person who issues the certified copy is the person who has the custody and authorized to certify a copy as true copy.
However when considering the documents before us, as observed earlier, majority of the documents are in private nature and in such a situation what is expected by the parties are to file papers to the satisfaction of court by submitting them with a certificate from the Attorney.
In this regard we have further concluded that under the said provisions, the Petitioner has a legal right for the performance of a legal duty from the 1st Respondent. That is to say that the Petitioner has a legal right to provisionally register under section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance (as amended) since she has fulfilled the necessary requirements I 42 under the said Ordinance. In this regard this court is further mindful of the Supreme Court decision in Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka V. Messns lafferiee an lafferjee Private Limited (2005) 1 Sri LR 89 where J.A.N. de. Silva J (as he was then) has identified some of the conditions precedent to the issue of writ of Mandamus.
For the forging reasons this court decides to grant the relief as prayed by the Petitioner in paragraphs (e), (t) and (g) to the Petition.
Since the arguments placed before this court was limited to the provisional registration under section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance (as amended) this court will not make any order with regard to the relief prayed in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) to the Petition.
Application allowed with cost.

Kandy SC regains top spot
As expected Kandy Sports Club show cased a completely dominating performance at Nittawela where they managed to remain unbeaten in the second round. Besides, this was their second highest score of the season. Kandy Sports Club with this win and also with bonus points goes top of the points table.
Kandy again made an instant impact and steered the Airmen into turbulence and made the game a one sided contest recording a score of 73-13 underlining their superiority. Now comes the crucial moment when both defending champions Kandy SC and second placed Havelock's SC lock horns in a crunch game. This game which is eagerly looked forward to will be on Sunday, 5 February at the Park grounds under lights commencing at 6.30 pm. Both teams are earnestly preparing themselves for this big game but they need to keep calm heads and take the field in the right manner. They have to adapt to the weather conditions and understand that both clubs have been on the back of a thumping and so they are going to want to put things right as well. It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future unlike most future events, it is impossible to know for certain who will win the 2016/17 rugby league championship. Will it be the Nittawela Club or the Park
Club Kandy SC has won the league on seventeen occasions, the only team to have done so in the history of rugby in Sri Lanka. Each club has played five games and only Kandy SC and Havelock's SC are in the running.
Kandy led by scrum half Roshan Weeraratne has a well-balanced side and have reached peak form with the team playing as one unit, particular the forwards have improved tremendously and co-ordinate well with the three quarters. If Roshans team continues to play in the same trend and fashion they should have no problem in retaining the League title this year too. The Kandy forwards are very big and heavy compared to the other clubs and a combined unit. They are also fast on their feet.
The back division too comprises some exciting players. In the game against Air Force SC, Kandy SC enjoyed some good advantage in territory, and went on to score fourteen tries; from the fifth minute of the first half they completely dominated the game in every department. The Airmen came into the game unsettled and they lacked momentum. Absolutely nothing went right for the Air Force although they were improving rapidly this season.
It must be mentioned that the Kandy Rugby Committee headed by Lasantha Wijesuriya, Coach - Sean Wijesinghe, Assistant Coach Nalaka Weerakoody, Team Manager Kapila Silva, Convener Saliya Kumara, and masseur Sanjeewa Perera and attendant S. Kumar for their devoted, committed, tireless and yeoman services done single-handedly to bring back the lost prestige and pride after a disastrous first round two defeats against the Air Force SC and Navy SC to head the points table with effect from this week.

A new board had been appointed but it has not been able to take any action as the appointment of a chairman has been pending since the old board and chairman were removed on January 17.
The change in management came amidst allegations that the controversial coal tender purchases in 2016 resulted in the government accruing a loss of Rs 4,145 million that year.
The losses revealed through a report prepared by the Auditor General had also recommended that the responsible officers be taken to task, Batagoda said.
Thus far, three separate committees have been appointed to investigate into the coal purchases.
I have appointed a preliminary investigations officer in accordance with the Establishment Code. He will investigate into whether there are any grounds for disciplinary action, he said.
The Minister has also appointed a three member committee to look into who the responsible officers are . In addition, Cabinet has appointed a committee comprising three Secretaries headed by Sudharma Karunaratne (Secretary to the Ministry of Petroleum Resources Development to find out whether the coal purchasing formula was changed,the Ministry Secretary added.
The two reports from within the Ministry are to be sent to Batagoda who is then expected to direct the Board to take necessary action. Cabinet will take a decision on its own committee report. Action however has been slow with no new Chairman to make the decisions at the Board. An additional secretary from the Ministry is in the meantime filling the vacancy.
The Audit report of the Auditor General had also questioned the conduct of the Lanka Coal Company over the past years and had called on the authorities to study whether it is necessary to continue with it.
Joint Opposition MPs in the meantime have also asked that the FCID investigate the illegal coal tender purchases. COPE last month announced that they would look into the coal controversy.

Lanka Tiles expand operations to India
Lanka Tiles recently entered into a successful strategic partnership with an Indian tile manufacturer Ambani Vitrified to meet the rapidly growing demand for wall and floor tiles in the local market.
The successful venture has seen Lanka Tiles placing a large order with the expectation of releasing more quantities of 24 x 24 tiles to the market in order to meet the escalating market demand. These tiles will also be complied with the standards imposed by the Sri Lanka Standards Institute and will pertain the SLS mark.
Lanka Walltiles and Lanka Tiles Managing Director Mahendra Jayasekera said to keep up with the increasing demand they have decided to partner with one of the best tile producers in India. The tiles will be produced in India but they will be sold under our brand name Lanka Tiles.
Jayasekara said they have stationed a few of our employees at the plant based in Gujarat to ensure that the tiles are produced according to our strict guidelines, specifications and standards. Accordingly, the key objective of the new venture between Lanka Tiles and Ambani Vitrified is to bridge the gap between the supply of good quality tiles and the demand for same in the local market and to ensure Lanka Tiles meets the rapidly growing market demand.

Largest heroin smuggling racket; 17 suspects further remanded
Seventeen suspects, including 14 foreigners allegedly involved in the largest heroin smuggling operation in the country, were yesterday further remanded until February 15 by the Colombo Fort Acting Magistrate J. Trotsky.
Meanwhile, the Magistrate was informed by the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) that they are yet to receive the analytical report from the Colombo University regarding the mobile phones recovered from the suspects possession.
The vessel in which the heroin was transported is currently docked at the Dikkowita Harbor and a Legal officer appearing from the Navy had requested permission to repair the vessel during the last hearing on January 18, 2017.
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayarathne had granted permission to repair the vessel.
The Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) with the assistance of the Sri Lanka Navy (SLN) seized 110 kilos of heroin on March 30, 2016 when the drugs were brought to Sri Lanka through the Southern seas.
PNB officials launched the special operation in the Southern seas with the assistance of the Navy Intelligence Unit.

Mercantile Cricket E Division 30 Overs League: Commercial Bank B burns Tobacco to ashes in opener
A blistering century by young stylish right hand batsman/wicket keeper Chamila Daminda (138* in 71 balls including 15 sixes and 4 fours ) saw Commercial Bank B loading up 235 runs for six wickets in just 24 overs and beat Ceylon Tobacco by 115 runs, thus giving a winning start to the on-going Mercantile Cricket E Division 30 Overs League tournament last weekend at Wesley grounds.
Due to heavy overnight downpour the play was restricted for 24 overs a side. Having invited to bat first in a slow pitch, Commercial Bank was greatly supported by Amal Kolinda and Chamila Daminda who put up a solid partnership of 74 runs for the 2nd wicket and Captain Dilshan Silva with Chamila in another good 78-run partnership for the 5th wicket.
Chasing a challenging target of 235 runs, Ceylon Tobacco batsmen could only managed to reach 120 sparing just a one wicket in their alloted 24 overs. Combank pace attack along with the spinners left no room for a single batsman to settle down.
Commercial Bank B - 235/6 (Chamila Daminda 138 not out, Amal Kolinda 39, Dilshan Silva 21)
Ceylon Tobacco - 120/9 in (Indika Konara 2/17, Shantha Fonseka 2/17, Manjula Liyanage 2/18, Bojith Chamara, Tharindu Nirmala and Bhagya Abeysekara shared a wicket each)

Miller and du Plessis hundreds set up thumping victory

Faf du Plessis' velvet-smooth 105, andDavid Miller's mature, unbeaten 117 - replete with finishing fireworks - sent South Africa to an imposing 307 that Sri Lanka would always struggle to chase, and in the end, fell a whopping 121 runs short of.
The batting was the basis of South Africa's dominance, but the bowling was disciplined as well, and the fielding was not short of sublime. Sri Lanka's openers fell to two spectacular catches - du Plessis leaping, right arm outstretched above head, to end Niroshan Dickwella's promising stay, and AB de Villiers sprinting back from mid-off to snaffle a tough overhead chance soon after.
JP Duminy's rapid run out of Asela Gunaratne rounded off the fielding performance, while Imran Tahir and co. refused to allow the opposition to ever get a feel for the chase. They were all out for 186 in the 38th over. Eight batsmen got into double figures but the highest score of the innings was Dinesh Chandimal's 36.
Sri Lanka's mistakes would be familiar to recent followers of their cricket. The chance to have South Africa 118 for 5 was spurned when du Plessis was dropped on 63 - that fifth wicket partnership going on to account for 117 and form the thorax of South Africa's innings. The bowling lacked penetration through the death overs - which has often been the case since Lasith Malinga's decline - and the batsmen produced a string of briefly encouraging but largely inconsequential innings. There was not a fifty partnership in the response.
It is also possible Sri Lanka erred in bowling first on what appeared a good batting track ahead of the match. Perhaps they might have reasoned that their only wins on tour - in the T20s - had come when chasing a score.
Du Plessis came to the crease in the fourth over of South Africa's innings, and was both secure and productive, seeing his team through early wobbles when Sri Lanka's beefed-up spin attack appeared ready to take control of the match.
It was the frill-free back foot punch that eventually took him to triple figures, but it had defined the early stages of du Plessis' innings as well, as he leant back to punish short deliveries from the spinners through the cover region - though plenty of runs came square of the leg side as well. In between the boundaries were a non-stop tick-tock of singles and twos. Where other batsmen in the top order were inert against spin early in their innings, du Plessis always seemed in control of the pace of his progress.
His sole mistake came on 63: reaching for a flighted Lakshan Sandakan stock ball, du Plessis sent a low edge to Dhananjaya de Silva at slip. The chance was grassed, and the partnership went on to flourish for more than 22 overs. Sandakan would have a half-chance off Miller go down as well, and seemed, in general, the best bowler in the attack - his big turn causing batsmen issues, even if his lack of control allowed them to get off strike easily as well.
While du Plessis' innings rarely waivered from a strike rate of around 90, Miller advanced more in spurts through the first half of his knock. Happy at first to work the ball around with his partner, he ventured big shots whenever his scoring rate began to lag: it was consecutive straight sixes of Dhananjaya de Silva that sped him from 39 off 52 balls to 51 off 54.
A diet of runs into the outfield sustained him after reaching that half century, but it wasn't long before the death overs coaxed him into a destructive mood again. He cracked Suranga Lakmal to the deep cover fence in the 44th over, smoked Kulasekara over long-on two overs later, then having completed his fourth ODI hundred off the first ball of the final over, exploded spectacularly in the last five balls to launch South Africa beyond 300. He hit two straight sixes off two wayward Kulasekara deliveries - the second of which sent the ball bouncing down the road - and finished the innings with a four behind square on the offside to boot. His last 18 balls yielded three sixes and 36 runs.
Briefly, there was hope for the Sri Lanka chase. Dickwella hit enterprising boundaries off the South Africa seamers, and Upul Tharanga - having re-promoted himself to the top of the innings - progressed smartly despite suffering two blows to the helmet. But when both were out to excellent catches off the bowling of Wayne Parnell, the run rate climbed, and wickets began to fall with regularity.
Kusal Mendis chipped an Andile Phehlukwayo ball to short cover, Dhananjaya de Silva was stumped after being dragged out of his crease by Tahir, Asela Gunaratne was run out for the second time in as many matches, and Chandimal was caught behind driving ambitiously as well. Beyond the 45-run opening stand, there was really no meaningful fight from the Sri Lanka batsmen, though they did at least go down swinging, rather than in a meek heap. At Chandimal's dismissal, the score was 132 for 6 in the 26th over, and hopes of victory were all but extinguished.
South Africa's bowlers shared the wickets around. Tahir and Parnell took two apiece, and Duminy had two lower middle-order batsmen holing out off his bowling as well. Rabada, Morris and Phehlukwayo all finished with one scalp.

New faces in Australia T20 squad for Sri Lanka
Sydney: Big-hitting Chris Lynn was named Wednesday in Australia's squad for their Twenty20 series against Sri Lanka despite injury worries, with four uncapped players also included.
Lynn was a dominant force for Brisbane Heat in the just-finished Big Bash League (BBL) but is still recovering from a neck injury and faces further fitness tests ahead of the opening clash in Melbourne on February 17.
"Chriss selection will depend on his fitness. He is due to see a specialist later this week and we will take into account that advice ahead of this series," said selector Trevor Hohns.
With captain Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner rested ahead of the upcoming Test tour of India, Michael Klinger, Billy Stanlake, Jyhe Richardson and Ashton Turner are in line for their international debuts.
Aaron Finch leads the squad as they look to improve Australia's current Twenty20 ranking of sixth in the world.
"We have chosen a squad with a good blend of experience combined with several younger players in an effort to improve our performance and therefore our ICC T20 ranking, said Hohns.
"The overall standards being set in the BBL are very high and many of these players are making a good impression, but consistency was key for the selectors on this occasion."
The selection of top order batsman Klinger, aged 36, was a surprise but Hohns said he had earned a call-up.
"He has been a very good player in this form of the game for some time now," he said.
"He has a history of strong performances in T20 competitions in the UK and in the BBL, including the match-winning innings for the Perth Scorchers to secure this years BBL title."
Wicketkeeper Tim Paine returns, adding experience to the team.
Australia play Sri Lanka in Melbourne on February 17, in Geelong on February 19 and then Adelaide on February 22.

No one can topple national unity government: President
Utterances that the good governance government will be toppled are only dreams. No one can topple this national unity government, President Maithripala Sirisena said while speaking at a gathering in Kaluwanchikudy yesterday.
The President said those who misused public funds during their ruling are dreaming to topple this good-governance government, but it is only a dream, which will never come true.
I dare say that this strong government, the outcome of the political uprising in 2015 of patriotic people, especially of people against corruption and frauds, cannot be toppled. No one will be allowed to topple this national unity government formed amidst challenges and obstacles, the President said.
The President made these remarks after commissioning a newly constructed OPD and ward complexes at the Kaluwanchikudy Base Hospital. The hospital was constructed at a cost of Rs. 523 million with the financial assistance of JICA.
Certain politicians who no longer have the peoples support are boasting that the government will be toppled. But I must say this is only a pipe dream, the President said.
The President said the government is engaged in forming a new Constitution aiming to strengthen ethnic harmony.
As mentioned by the Opposition Leader, every countryman wishes to see a unity country. Accordingly, ethnic harmony will be strengthened while devolving power through the new Constitution. However, certain persons once again claims that the government is going to divide and betray the country through implementing a new Constitution, he said.
The President said preliminary steps of drafting the new Constitution will be completed by the next few months. He said same allegation in this nature of dividing the country was raised when establishing Provincial councils of then government. But country has not been divided through Provincial Councils.
Those days it was
said that visa would be needed for travellng from one
Provincial Council to another, he added.
He said the governments aim is to create a peaceful, strong country where anyone can live happily and peacefully. Therefore, the government will never allow to destroy ethnic harmony of the country.

Pathfinder Economic Flash  : Sri Lanka must establish  Marine Science Research  Station on Kachchativu
Last month there were reports in the press that a group of Indian citizens was planning to raise their national flag on the island of Kachchativu to coincide with India's Republic Day celebrated on January 26.
That threat failed to materialise. February is an important month for another reason. Around that time of the year, both Sri Lankans and Indians from Tamil Nadu will jointly celebrate the St. Anthony's festival there.
Despite the bonhomie atmosphere during the festival season, the small island wedged between Rameshwaram and the Delft island will continue to be a bone of contention between the two countries until the fisheries dispute is amicably resolved.
From time to time, there have been demands by interest groups in Tamil Nadu for retrieving the island, which was allegedly ceded to Sri Lanka following the Agreement between the two countries on the Boundary in Historic Waters between the Two Countries and Related Matters, signed in June 1974. Such demands have become a common feature, particularly when Tamil Nadu fishermen poaching in Sri Lankan waters, whether in the Palk Bay, the Gulf of Mannar or even in the eastern coast of the island in the Bay of Bengal, were apprehended by Sri Lankan authorities.
Reports on flag hoisting may represent a mischievous attempt intended to disturb the prevailing friendly relations between the two countries, as questions of sovereignty over Kachchativu were discussed and amicably resolved some 40 years ago, after Sri Lanka conclusively established that its sovereignty over the island went back to the colonial period.
It is noteworthy that as recently as 1924,Kachchativu was listed in correspondence with Survey Officers of the Government of India (GOI) as a part of what was then Ceylon. Historical records confirm that the Island was under Sri Lanka's sovereignty during Portuguese,Dutch and later the British colonial times.
The 285-acre island is located 12.4 nautical miles northwest of the Delft Island and 13.3 nautical miles northeast of Rameshwaram. Sri Lanka's sovereignty over Kachchativu was formally and legally recognised at the highest political level in both countries after the Agreement was signed by Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in June 1974and ratified by the respective Parliaments.

So clearly and permanently were the rights of the two countries established and regulated by the Agreement, that when questions were recently raised regarding ownership of the island, the then Attorney-General of India Mukul Rohatgi, representing the Centre, reportedly expressed the opinion to a Supreme Court bench led by Chief Justice of India R.M. Lodha, said on August 26,2014 that If you want Katchatheevu back, you will have to go to war to get it back.
Continuing surveillance maintained over centuries, Kachchativu is regularly visited by Sri Lankan government officers - scientists, administrators, surveyors and military personnel from time to time. A high point in activity on the island is the religious festival held there in the months of February/March annually and widely attended by Sri Lankans and Indians.
Observing that the original shrine built in 1905 was in a dilapidated condition, Sri Lanka Navy constructed a new shrine, which was consecrated by the Bishop of Jaffna in December 2016.
From time to time, some commentators have mischievously claimed that the Agreement grants to Indian fishermen the right to fish in and around Kachchativu, and that there has been interference with the exercise of that right.Article 5 of the 1974 Agreement grants Indian fishermen and pilgrims access to visit Kachchativu as hitherto, and will not be required by Sri Lanka to obtain travel documents or visa for these purposes.
The phrase as hitherto refers to visits for drying fishing nets or for religious observances. It does not refer to fishing or other activities, which are, by Article 4 of the agreement, fully subject to Sri Lanka's sovereignty and exclusive jurisdiction. Paragraph 1 of the Exchange of Letters between the two countries in 1976 clearly prohibits fishing in the Indian waters by Sri Lankans and Sri Lankan waters by Indians by stating Fishing vessels and fishermen of India shall not engage in fishing in the historic waters, the territorial sea and the EEZ of Sri Lanka nor shall the fishing vessels and fishermen of Sri Lanka engage in fishing in the historic waters, the territorial sea and the EEZ of India, without the express permission of Sri Lanka of India, as the case may be.In any case, with the introduction of the steel hulled mechanized trawlers by Tamil Nadu fishing syndicates, man-made fiberfishing nets and the gradual disappearance of artisan fishing methods, the need for drying fishing nets on the island has become a long forgotten practice.
Considering the damage done to the marine environment over the past several decades, particularly fisheries, due to unceasing bottom trawling by Tamil Nadu fishermen using fishing nets banned by Sri Lanka, Colombo should adopt a strategy to take stock of the situation and come up with solutions to address the issues before the damage done becomes irreversible.
One way to address the issue is to establish a marine science research station in Kachchativu, which is said to be home to unusual varieties of marine flora and fauna, as the area surrounding the island has taken the brunt of poaching.
The government should request the National Aquatic Resources Agency (NARA) and the Department of Fisheries to come up with a plan to undertake such a venture without delay. Living quarters, communication facilities and research equipment will be needed to make the research station functional.
Regular exchange of personnel should be organized as well as transport and emergency services.
If resources are difficult in the short term, support of the private sector may be sought to commence the project.
Meanwhile, the two countries should make every effort to cooperate to resolve the fisheries issue and take steps for conservation and sustainable exploitation of marine resources on their side of the International Maritime Boundary Line.
