Elderly population doubles
The ageing population in Sri Lanka has doubled in the last three decades with the majority being women.
Sri Lanka has the fastest ageing population in South Asia, with 2.5 million of its people being above the age of 60. By 2030, it is projected that one in five persons will fall into the category.
A report prepared by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) on the Ageing population of Sri Lanka stated that the island has 289,000 older women more than men in 2012, which marked the feminization of ageing in Sri Lanka.
The report further highlighted that 56 percent of the elderly population in total was made up of women and as the years piled, the number simply increased, with 61 percent of the oldest group (80 and over) being women.
Having an ageing population is an achievement having invested so long in healthcare and education. Now it is up to us to do the rest for this population which we have helped create, Director General of DCS, Dr A.J. Satharasinghe said addressing the UNFPA inter-generational dialogue on population ageing held at the Cinnamon Grand yesterday.
He pointed out that the elderly population comprising the young-old (60-69 years), made up of the majority of the elderly and that it was important to find employment opportunities for the group which can still work.
This, Dr Satharasinghe said would help reduce the age dependency ration which has increased from 11 to 20 percent from 1980 to 2012.
The need to look after the elderly thus is going to be an economic burden for the Government and the working population.
Census data found that close to 10 percent of the elderly population had not attended school and that two thirds had a secondary or lower education. Moreover, 43 percent of older men were employed which only 11 percent of older women were meaningfully employed.
Adding to the womens vulnerability was the fact that one in three were widows.
With regard to living arrangements, only 1 percent lived in homes. It is a number we cannot be satisfied with, Dr. Satharasinghe said.
He said 56 percent of older persons were heads of households, adding stress to them and 59.2 percent lived in extended families. In the estate sector, three fourth of the elderly lived in semi-permanent housing. The majority of the elderly, 31 percent lived in the Western Province.
The greatest concern for the elderly unsurprisingly was sickness, as Dr. Satharasinghe explained that over half had physical and mental impairments while one of two suffered from chronic diseases (17.8 percent of total population).
This meant that the Healthcare system of the country needed to be specially trained to look after the elderly, Dr Satharasinghe said.
Overall, the DCS DG said the Government needed to look into policies which would address this underutilized workforce in future while also making necessary changes to accommodate geriatric care in the health sector.

Namal backtracks after anti-India protest at Hambantota
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksas legislator son Namal beat a hasty retreat yesterday after leading an anti-India protest outside the Indian Consulate and clashing with police at Hambantota.
The young Member of Parliament used a loud hailer to work the crowd to a frenzy as the Joint Opposition rally marched from the Hambantota beach to the Consulate.
Indo (Indian) colony apita epa, Indo colony apita epa, (we dont want Indian colonies, we dont want Indian colonies), Namal repeated at the top of his voice, while his chorus shouted Epa, epa (dont want, dont want).
He then switched to China drumming up anti-Chinese slogans on the same lines.
However, as the video and audio of Namal Rajapaksas militant xenophobic attack was carried on social media, the Hambantota young MP attempted damage control by issuing a tweet saying he was not targeting any country.
Our protest is not against investment or any specific country. Were protesting against the #SriLanka Government & its policies, Namal Rajapaksa said on Twitter. However, it was too late as social media had already lit up with his anti-India and anti-China rants.
Fearing a backlash from the Colombo-based diplomatic community, the young parliamentarian took to Twitter to try and minimise the damage to the image of Mahinda Rajapaksa who during his regime had welcomed foreign capital, particularly from India and China.
The Rajapaksa-led protest came amid reports that Indian companies have shown interest in a public-private partnership to revive the loss-making Mattala international airport whose revenue is insufficient to even pay salaries of staff employed there.
The 210-million US dollar airport services only one flight a day and has already established a world record as the least utilised international airport.
Some of the anti-Indian and anti-Chinese placards carried said, Let us save the country from Chinese and Indian octopuses.
Namal Rajapaksa defied a court order and led demonstrators to the Indian consulate prompting the authorities to use water cannon and tear gas to defend the diplomatic compound and its staff, police said.
Police used loud hailers to warn the demonstrators that they were in breach of a magisterial order outlawing the protest. However, it was ignored and parliamentarian Rajapaksa led his supporters towards the Indian consulate. They tried to dismantle barricades and storm the diplomatic premises triggering a police water cannon and teargas attack. Former foreign minister G. L. Peiris represented Basil Rajapaksas Sri Lanka Podujana Party.
Police said they arrested 28 people, including six women, who defied the court order and clashed with police. Four policem

Resolution denounces Maha Sanga being called Cheevaradhariya
A resolution was agreed upon to denounce some politicians calling the Maha Sanga as Cheevaradhariya at a meeting of Buddhist monks of Sri Lanka Ramagngna Maha Nikaya of the Uva Province.
The meeting was held recently at Veheragala, Sevanagala under the patronage of Most Ven. Navimana Nalaka Thera, Uva Province Chief Sanganayake of Sri Lanka Ramagngna Nikaya.
Incumbents of temples of Ramagngna Nikaya in the Uva Province participated, including Lekakadhikari Ven. Lathpandure Vipula Badra Thera.
It was decided at the meeting to send the resolution to the Mahanayaka of Ramagngna Nikaya Most Ven.Napane Pemasiri Thera. Speaking at the meeting, Most Ven. Nalaka Thera said due to improper attitudes of some monks, the Maha Sanga has to face this situation.
On the other hand, there are 31 Mahanayake Theras and 65 Anunayake Theras in different Buddhist sects and there is no unity, the Thera said.

Special audit reports to Parliament this month
The special audit reports on the Central Expressway and SriLankan Airlines will be presented to Parliament this month, Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, the AG said his Department is currently working on these audit reports as per the instructions of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE). The two reports will be handed over to the Speaker and the COPE Secretariat. The report on the Central Expressway deals with the procurement procedure followed with regard to the construction of section three of the Central Expressway and the report on the SriLankan Airlines deals with the order made to purchase eight long distance airbuses and its cancellation.
Both these are serious and complicated issues. Our teams are now collecting the necessary documents pertaining to the audit, he said.
Commenting on the order of eight A350 airbuses for SriLankan Airlines, the AG termed it as an insane decision that resulted in a heavy financial burden to the country. SriLankan Airlines ordered those eight aircraft at once despite the fact that it was already incurring a massive loss.
It was done without knowing any means to repay and without knowing any route to operate them. Certainly it was not done thinking of the future market, he said.
The AG pointed out that he would not term the additional cost the Government had to bear in cancelling the aircraft deal as a loss.
Had the Government proceeded on the deal the total cost the Government has to bear would have been enormous. We will indicate that figure in the report. The compensation payment was to avoid that plight. Already Rs 16 billion has been paid as compensation to cancel four airbuses and the last payment in that regard is still to be made. The amount of compensation for the rest of aircraft is yet to be negotiated, he explained.
The AG, further observing that the SriLankan Airlines came under the scrutiny of the AGs Department very recently, said the Department audited it for the first time last year.
The AG also said a performance audit on the SriLankan Airlines is being conducted now, adding that the payments made to its management would come under scrutiny during the audit.
We understand that there are certain issues over the payments made to its top management. The details of them will come out when we present our 2016 audit report with regard to the Sri Lankan, he stated.

Twenty eight arrested for unruly behaviour near Htota Indian Consulate
The Police yesterday, arrested 28 protesters for unruly behaviour during a protest held at the Indian Consulate in Hambantota.
The group led by the Joint Opposition had earlier planned to hold their protest outside the Mattala Airport but plans changed as the Police obtained a court order to prevent them from engaging in any protests outside the airport.
At the Indian Consulate, a tense situation led to clashes between the Police and protesters, leading to their arrest with four policemen being injured in the attack. Police had used tear gas and water cannon to disperse the crowd.
The group which had the participation of MPs Namal Rajapaksa, Mahinda Ananda Aluthgamage, Prof G.L. Peiris, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena and Sanath Nishantha had launched the protest against the involvement of foreign companies at the Hambantota Port and Mattala Airport. They had stated that they were against these assets being sold to foreigners.
The government of Sri Lanka in July signed a USD 1.1 billion deal with the Chinese over the Hambantota Port where the latter received a 70 percent stake on a 99-year lease.
This was seen as a move to reduce the amount of debt the country owed to China.
Both the Port as well as the airport were projects initiated during the Rajapaksa regime with Chinese loans and has since then become white elephants. The Mattala Airport since being built has been known as the worlds emptiest airport.

New state medical faculties will be established at Wayamba, Sabaragamuwa and Moratuwa universities. The existing State Medical Faculty of Ruhuna University will be expanded, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Dr. Senaratne, education will not be privatised. The elderly population is on the increase. More funds need to be invested in the health sector in order to prevent elders from suffering out of various diseases. He was addressing the gathering during the World Elders' Day celebration held at Beruwala recently.
Minister Senaratne said that all should have the right to obtain education without any problem. A child of a person who cut bricks is now studying at SAITM. We need to protect these children. There are problems faced by these people and we need to solve them.
Doctors need to get-together and service the people. Some people admire them and some people blame them. There are good doctors as well as bad doctors. Some doctors are waiting to strike, he added.

Anti-nuclear campaign ICAN wins Nobel Peace Prize
A nuclear disarmament group has won the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize for its decade-long campaign to rid the world of the atomic bomb.
As nuclear-fuelled crises swirl over North Korea and Iran, the International Campaign To Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) was awarded the honour yesterday.
The organisation is receiving the award for its work to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and for its ground-breaking efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition of such weapons, said Norways Nobel committee president Berit Reiss-Andersen.
Beatrice Fihn, the leader of the grassroots ICAN organisation, was delighted with the prize, adding that US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un should know that nuclear weapons are illegal.
More than 70 years since atomic bombs were used on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and as tensions flare over the North Korean crisis, the Nobel committee sought to highlight ICANs efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons.
Founded in Vienna in 2007 on the fringes of an international conference on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the Geneva-based ICAN has tirelessly mobilised campaigners and celebrities alike in its cause.
ICAN was a key player in the adoption of a historic nuclear weapons ban treaty, signed by 122 countries in July. However, the accord was largely symbolic as none of the nine known world nuclear powers signed up to it.
The Nobel committee said ICAN has been a driving force in prevailing upon the worlds nations to pledge to cooperate... in efforts to stigmatise, prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons.
Ms Reiss-Andersen noted that similar prohibitions have been reached on chemical and biological weapons, land mines and cluster munitions.
Nuclear weapons are even more destructive, but have not yet been made the object of a similar international legal prohibition, she said.
Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Walsstrom said that giving the prize to ICAN was well-deserved and timely.
The organisation will receive its prize - consisting of a gold medal, diploma, and a cheque for nine million Swedish kronor (845,000) at a ceremony in Oslo on December 10, the anniversary of the death in 1896 of the prizes creator, Swedish philanthropist and dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel.
The Norwegian committee that chooses the winner sorted through more than 300 nominations for this years award, which recognises both accomplishments and intentions.
