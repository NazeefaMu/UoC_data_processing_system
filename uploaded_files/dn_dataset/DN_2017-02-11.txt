The National Flag was hoisted by the Ambassador of Sri Lanka, A.M.J. Sadiq to the accompaniment of  Magul Bera , in the presence of a large number of Sri Lankans, Dutch friends and well-wishers. The National Anthem was sung in Sinhala and Tamil, followed by the observance of 2 minutes silence in remembrance of all Sri Lankans who had sacrificed their lives for the country. The lighting of the oil lamp by the Ambassador, Second Secretary and the Attach followed.
Religious observances were conducted by 4 religious dignitaries representing Buddhist, Hindu, Christian and Islamic faiths.
Children from all four communities represented in Sri Lanka, lit the oil lamp, symbolic of the ardent desire and aspiration of all peace loving Sri Lankans for national unity and genuine reconciliation. The Ambassador highlighted the need for all Sri Lankans to acquire at least conversational ability in the three languages of Sri Lanka, namely Sinhala, Tamil & English, which would help create a new society in which people would be able to truly appreciate the value and benefit of life in a multi-cultural, multi-faith and multi-linguistic environment. In this manner, it would be possible for all communities to embrace and cherish the rainbow diversity of the nation.

## Title: Amla, de Kock tons lead SA to 5-0 and No. 1

Amla, de Kock tons lead SA to 5-0 and No. 1

South Africa rode a roaring 187-run first-wicket stand and two effortless centuries from their openers to a monumental 384 for 6 and, eventually, the No. 1 ODI ranking. Their reward for winning an 11th ODI on the trot was the unseating of Australia - whom they had also thrashed 5-0 at home last year - and moving one point clear at the top of the table.
South Africa's dominance of Sri Lanka in this series has been complete. They outbatted, outbowled and outfielded the visitors again, and this win - an 88-run thumping - was a fitting finish. The only consolations for Sri Lanka wereAsela Gunaratne's hard-earned-but-inconsequential maiden century, as well as having batted 50 overs for the first time in the series.
IfQuinton de Kockwas the early aggressor, taking the innings by the collar inside the Powerplay,Hashim Amlabided his time, and only later fashioned violence from timing and grace. Amla embraced all-out attack only after reaching triple figures, but even at his most belligerent, did not lose the characteristic zen. The head stayed steady and the wrists whipped through the ball at the point of contact. His 154 from 134 deliveries was his second-highest ODI score, and again helped showcase the awesome might of this South Africa top order. Even on days when AB de Villiers does not fire, they can still make insurmountable scores.
It was thanks to more poor catching, more wayward bowling, and the general lack of menace in their attack that Sri Lanka found themselves stuck chasing the biggest score of the series. Though they had made something of the pursuit of 368 in Cape Town on Tuesday, they did not manage to stay in the game beyond the early stages of their innings this time.
Niroshan Dickwella flashed attractively for a 19-ball 39, but the rest of the top order fell around him. They were 82 for 5 in the 14th over, their fate virtually sealed, but Gunaratne and Sachith Pathirana sought to make the best of a bad situation by putting on a 93-run sixth-wicket stand. After Pathirana departed, the tail made it their mission to get Gunaratne to his hundred. He wound up with 114 off 117 balls, and Sri Lanka made their way to a somewhat respectable 296 for 8.
Sri Lanka had in fact asked South Africa to bat at the toss, and though Suranga Lakmal bothered Amla's outside edge in the early overs, de Kock quickly set about lighting the thrusters under the innings. He collared a pair of boundaries in each of the eighth, ninth and tenth overs. By the time the fielding restrictions ended, South Africa had sped to 71 for no loss, and de Kock to 47 from 35 balls.
When slip fielder Upul Tharanga failed to lay a hand on a catchable outside edge from Amla in the 15th over, South Africa were allowed to continue progressing at their hectic pace.
Tharanga did change his bowlers up regularly, in attempts to prevent batsmen from establishing a rhythm, but save for that edge from the offspin of Dhananjaya de Silva, chances failed to come. Both batsmen were severe on errors of line from the spinners, who collectively bowled quickly through the air. With little turn on offer, de Kock and Amla were plundering runs into the outfield off most deliveries, and rarely failing to seize boundary opportunities.
At the halfway stage of the innings, no bowler had managed to concede less than a run a ball and South Africa, at 180 for 0, were almost certainly heading for a mammoth score. It was in the 25th over that de Kock struck his 15th four of the innings - a powerful sweep to beat backward square leg - and went to triple figures for the 12th time in his ODI career. Few of his other hundreds would have come so easily. He holed out to deep cover soon after, though, finishing with 109 off 87 deliveries.
Perhaps in an innings like this, it is the likes of de Villiers, JP Duminy and Farhaan Behardien who are expected to take control of the death overs, but in fact it was Amla himself who led the final charge. Having timed the ball beautifully for the first 40 overs, he seamlessly incorporated power into his game after completing his 24th hundred in the 41st.
He carved sixes over point, slammed the short balls over deep square leg, and even struck cleanly down the ground - launching successive Lahiru Madushanka balls over the rope between long-on and cow corner in the 47th over. Having scored his hundred at slower than a run-a-ball, Amla smoked his next 54 runs in 22 deliveries. Each of his five sixes came in that period.
Sri Lanka's top order came out attempting to get ahead of their taxing required rate early, but wound up making too many fatal mistakes. Tharanga sent an outside edge to third man in the fourth over; Kusal Mendis picked out mid-off with a lofted drive in the sixth; Dickwella, after slapping and scooping merrily, was caught at mid-off as well. Sandun Weerakkody and de Silva did not last long either - the latter's modest tour of South Africa ended by a Tahir googly, which bowled him through the gate.
Gunaratne was slow to begin with but sped up after the departure of Pathirana, who had been the aggressor in their association. Having seen off the quicks, Gunaratne picked out the spinners to attack, sweeping and reverse-sweeping especially well, while the likes of Jeffrey Vandersay and Lakmal gave him company. He reached triple-figures in the 48th over - his second fifty having come off 25 balls.

Colombo Financial City Project: NO IMPACT ON FISHERIES INDUSTRY: NARA
In Western, North Western, Southern Provinces:
The National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) yesterday reassured that the construction work on the Colombo Financial City in the sea off Galle Face Green has had no impact on the fisheries industry or on fisheries activities in the Western, North Western or Southern Provinces.
NARA on the directive of Fisheries and Acquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera conducted a comprehensive investigation to ascertain as to whether the ongoing construction work on the Colombo Financial City would affect the fisheries industry. Minister Amaraweera had ordered NARA to initiate a full investigation after allegations were levelled from many quarters that the fisheries industry in the three provinces would be affected as a result of the ongoing construction in the sea off Galle Face promenade.
The investigation conducted by NARA through Sonar technology yesterday, confirmed that the construction has had no impact on the fisheries industry.
The Institute in its investigation report has outlined that sand required for the reclamation of land is mined from a location in the sea which is 10 kilometers off the land.
The report has rejected the allegations made by fisher folk that marine resources in the area where the sand mining is taking place for the project are being destroyed.The report was presented to Fisheries and Acquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday.
However, a Rs.500 million fund has been allocated through this project for the uplift of fishermens living standards. Arrangements are being made to utilise these funds for the provision of facilities to the fisheries folk through 57 fishing societies.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said after accepting the NARA report that a constant dialogue between the authorities and the fisheries communities is essential to make the Colombo Financial City project a success.

Confusion reigns in House over procedural error
Confusion reigned in Parliament Thursday morning over a procedural error over passing of several orders moved by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake on Wednesday.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had to call for a Party Leaders Meeting suspending the sittings abruptly for 10 minutes at 10.45 am to sort out the issue following protests by Joint Opposition MPs.
Parliament on Wednesday took up for debate Land (Restrictions on Alienation) (Amendment) Bill, Resolution under the Customs Ordinance, Order under the Special Commodity Levy Act, and Notification under the Excise Ordinance. However, at the end of debate only Land (Restrictions on Alienation) (Amendment) Bill was passed missing the other three items on the order paper.
The Speaker admitting the procedural error requested the approval of the House to pass the other three items on the Order Paper, but the Joint Opposition MPs faced off stating it was against Parliamentary tradition.
Minutes of Parliament cannot be reversed. What you can do is to announce the mistake and take them up on another date, MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said.
Speaker Jayasuriya and Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella pointed out that similar instances had been there in the past, adding that there was nothing wrong in passing them later. As the argument was dragging on, the Speaker was forced to call for a Party Leaders Meeting suspending the sittings to resolve the matter.
As the House resumed, the Speaker regretted the error and said the Standing Orders provide to pass the Orders next day. At this point, the JO came up with another argument over a technicality in the Gazette, but the Speaker cast it off and ruled that the gazette was properly presented.
Accordingly, the Resolution under the Customs Ordinance, Order under the Special Commodity Levy Act, and Notification under the Excise Ordinance were passed in Parliament on Thursday.

Donald Trump considers issuing new travel ban

Donald Trump is considering a new executive order to ban citizens of certain countries from travelling to the US after his initial attempt was overturned in the courts.
Trump told reporters on Air Force One that a "brand new order" could be issued as early as Monday or Tuesday.
It comes after an appeals court in San Francisco upheld a court ruling to suspend his original order.
It barred entry from citizens from seven mainly Muslim countries.
It is unclear what a new US immigration order might look like.
Trump said that it would change "very little", but he did not provide details of any new ban under consideration.
On Thursday, the appeals court said the administration failed to offer "any evidence" to justify the ban, which the president said was necessary to keep the US safe from terror attacks.
However Trump insisted that the executive order was crucial for national security and promised to take action "very rapidly" to introduce "additional security" steps in the wake of the court's decision.
He spoke as Virginia state lawyers argued in court that his policy "resulted from animus toward Muslims".
Their challenge focuses on the travel restrictions imposed by the ban, rather than the four-month suspension of refugee admissions.
But lawyers for the US government in Virginia wrote that "judicial second-guessing" amounted to "an impermissible intrusion" on Trump's constitutional authority.
The appeals court ruling means that visa holders from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen can continue to enter the US, and refugees from around the world, who were also subject to a temporary ban, are no longer blocked either.
But the ruling does not affect one part of Trump's controversial executive order: a cap of 50,000 refugees to be admitted in the current fiscal year, down from the ceiling of 110,000 established under his predecessor, Barack Obama.

Drought may affect Ampara Maha paddy harvest
The Ampara district which is, described as the granary of the East may face a drop in the 2016/17 Maha season paddy harvest as a result of the prolonged drought, farmers said. Although harvesting is in progress, the expected yield may not be forthcoming, farmers said. Around 58,500 hectares of paddy lands were brought under paddy cultivation during the current Maha season, sources said.
Farmers of the district showed greater enthusiasm in paddy cultivation. However,the scarcity of water, severe drought,subsequent floods when the crops were ripening and damage caused by wild elephants hindered the paddy yield, sources added.
Meanwhile, paddy harvesting in Addalaichenai and the surrounding areas is in progress while rice mill owners and middle men are busy in purchasing paddy from farmers.
At the very start, the price of a bag of paddy (65 Kilograms) was sold at Rs:3,300. But, at present the price of a bag of paddy has come down to Rs:2800. Most of the farmers have cultivated red rice dry this season.
The combine harvester is harvesting about 5 to 6 acres per day. There are several combine harvesting machines at operation. Drought and flood affected farmers sustained heavy losses. They have complained to the relevant officials regarding this matter.

Lanka Sathosa Chairman Rohantha Athukorala said that 3,000 MT of imported rice had been distributed to Lanka Sathosa outlets last week.
Athukorala said that 20 to 25 percent of the countrys rice needs is supplied through Lanka Sathosa after the controlled prices came in to force.
Therefore, the supply of rice Sathosa has to be increased to meet the increasing consumer demand at Sathosa outlets, he added.
Consumers complained of a shortage of rice supply in the market, including Sathosa outlets even after the controlled prices were gazetted, he said.
It was also reported that a kilogram of rice was being sold in the range between Rs.95 to Rs.98 even after the gazette notification was published on controlled prices and some traders were refusing to sell at the stipulated prices Athukorala said.
Rice suppliers from islandwide economic centres said that it was not economically viable to sell rice at controlled prices,when compared to the cost they had incurred to purchase stocks. They also pointed out that this situation had arose due to the delay caused in publishing the controlled prices, he said.
All Ceylon Farmers Federation National Organiser Namal Karunaratne said this would create unfavourable situations for farmers.
Special Assignment Minister Sarath Amunugama said Government certified prices should be considered when purchasing paddy stocks in the future and a controlled price mechanism would be rigorously executed.

The team will include the Divisional Secretary, Assistant Divisional Secretary, Director (Planning), and the Samurdhi Head Office Manager, he said. Dissanayake explained to parliament the importance of the name Samurdhi as well.
The name was proposed by Prof. Sunil Ariyaratne. This word Samurdhi gives the same meaning in Tamil, Pali, Sanskrit, and Hindi, the minister said.
He said the Samurdhi took examples from the Janasawiya of the late President, Premadasa, Indias Sewa programme, Bangladeshs Gramin Project, South Koreas Samuel Don project among others.
The Samurdhi was not properly implemented by the previous government. This government will pay attention to the complaint that the UNP supporters were deprived of Samurdhi due to political reasons, he said
JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa said the previous government spent over Rs. 50 million to change the project name from Samurdhi to Divineguma.
So, is the government planing to spend Rs. 75 million to change the name back to Samurdhi Jayatissa questioned.
The MP said 8,000 Samurdhi families were not received the death concessionaires that they were entitled for in 2013, 2014, and 2015.
The Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said the government had paid all the death concessionaires in the year 2015/16.
The MP said the previous regime did not paid the transport allowances that Samurdhi officers were entitled for.
To fully pay the transport allowance, they should have paid Rs. 209 millions. However, only Rs. 49 million were paid, he said.
The MP queried why the Samurdhi Social Security Fund is not audited by the Auditor General.
Minister S.B. Dissanayake said the requests were made several times, but it did not become a reality since the funding is not of the government.

Quality of all medical faculties should be maintained: Amunugama
Special Assignments Minister Sarath Amunugama stressed that not only the quality of the medical degree of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) but also the quality of all other medical graduates of all other state medical faculties including that of the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) Medical Faculty should be measured and evaluated.
The quality of a medical faculty should be maintained. Then the quality of all faculties of medicine and their graduates should be evaluated. Therefore, it is better to hold a common examination to measure the standards and quality of every medical graduate, he said.
The minister was addressing a media briefing recently at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa participated.
Amunugama said the quality of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) should also be looked in, as there should be a quality for the GMOA as well. If there is an issue with the quality of the SAITM, it should be rectified. But the agitations and allegations levelled against the SAITM by the GMOA is not justifiable. The minister said more private universities should be established since all the Advanced Level qualified students cannot be absorbed to state universities. Freedom to gain education is a right and no one can obstruct it, he said.
SAITM was started during the former President Mahinda Rajapaksas regime with his financial assistance of Rs. 600 million. Besides the SAITM medical faculty, it was planned during the last regime to commence three more medical faculties including the KDU medical faculty.
The decision of Rajapaksa to start more private universities is a good move. But it is peculiar that he shows a totally different picture now, he said.
The minister said local higher education institutions are better than most other such institutions in India, Bangladesh, Nepal among others.
The HIP was first mooted by the then government. It was a feeder to the Hambantota harbour and the Hambantota Airport. They cannot perform without a feeder. Establishing the HIP was also a good move of Rajapaksa, he said.
The minister said development activities in Hambantota including the HIP were carried out through separate body called Magampura Development Company under the Rajapaksa regime. But Rajapaksa is opposing the HIP now, he said.

Sanitary Waste Disposal Center at Wilpattu: CEA rejected previous Govts proposal
The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) rejected the proposal made by the previous government to establish the Sanitary Waste Disposal Centre in the Wilpattu National Park premises, Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said.
Megapolis and Western Development Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna was replying to a question raised in Parliament by MP Udaya Gammanpila on the current progress of the establishment of the waste disposal center.
Alagiyawanna pointed out the rejection is based on the reasons that the waste disposal center is proposed to be established in the Wilpattu conservation premises and the serious resistance displayed by area residents along with the NGOs on environmental protection.
Alagiyawanna further said, the Economic Management Committee headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has already called for a meeting with all the responsible institutions regarding the matter.
At the meeting,the Economic Managemment Committee took a decision to use an alternative land which is not in the Wipattu premises and is now proposed to be used for the establishment of the garbage disposal center, Alagiyawanna said.
The Deputy Minister also said that primary surveying activities of the land has been is completed.
We are yet to receive the Environmental Assessment Report for the proposed land from the Central Environmental Authority, he added.
MP Gammanpila said during the time of their government, they only considered public resistance only if the resistance was based on accurate facts with a scientific basis.
We did not give up on development projects just because people are ignorant or some people are envious of the progress made, he said.
Replying to Gammanpilas statement, Alagiyawanna said a government cannot just disregard public opinion and what is best for the country and should come to an amicable solution that is acceptable to all parties involved in a matter.

Sri Lanka has unique rehabilitation service system: Rajitha
Sri Lanka has a unique system to provide rehabilitation services. The last 2012 census revealed that 14.2 percent of the total population in Sri Lanka suffered from chronic disorders. Persons with either physical or mental disability accounted for 8.7 percent, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing the World Health Organisation (WHO) meeting on Rehabilitation 2030: A Call for Action, in Geneva on February 6.
The minister stated that vision and walking disabilities topped the list. Some have multiple disabilities. The Health Ministry had teamed up with the Higher Education Ministry to train at various levels, including at graduate and post-graduate levels to address the lack of physiotherapists (now 530), occupational therapist (120), prosthetists and orthotists (39), and speech therapists (63). Proposed school for occupational therapists at Rheumatology and Rehabilitation Hospital would be useful in this regard.
According to the ministry, physical rehabilitation care is provided at four levels through five rehabilitation hospitals and 600 hospitals island-wide. The disabled is provided with facilities by the Health, Social Services and Skills Development, Public Administration, and Education Ministries. Mental rehabilitation is led by the National Institute of Mental Health in collaboration with 550 psychiatric in-patient units, outreach clinics, outpatient clinics and community mental health programmes.
Sri Lanka had enjoyed universal health coverage for over six decades and had good health indicators with life expectancy for males and females at 72 years and 80 years respectively. The island has been undergoing an epidemiological transition leading to a rise in acute and chronic non- communicable diseases, the minister had stated.
Annual tobacco related deaths number 24,000. Eighty percent of the packet of cigarettes was taken for pictorial warning under the instruction of the government. We are now moving towards plain packaging on tobacco products. Tobacco advertising will be restricted and ban on selling loose cigarettes is contemplated, the minister had stated. Fixing the maximum retail prices for 48 mostly used drugs, amidst much resistance from pharmaceutical lobby groups, was another initiative towards reducing the burden on tertiary preventative initiatives, reducing the price of some drugs by 65 percent, the minister had stated.

Sri Lanka to launch tourism promotion in Fujian, China
The Sri Lanka government will undertake a tourism promotion drive in Fujian province of China next week to attract more and more Chinese tourists, a Sri Lankan Minister said on Friday.
Tourism Promotion Minister John Amaratunga told Xinhua that tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka were up by 20 percent in January compared with the corresponding period of the last year.
"We received more than 200,000 tourists last month. This is despite flight restrictions at the Colombo Bandaranaike International Airport for renovations of the runways," he said.
Asserting that the Chinese and Indian nationals account for a bulk of tourist arrivals, he said he would leave for Fujian on Feb. 17 to start a promotion drive with the help of authorities in the southeastern province of China.
"We will set up a tourism promotional centre in that area for the benefit of those willing to travel in Sri Lanka," he said.
Last year 2.2 million tourists visited Sri Lanka. The minister said he was targeting to bring as many as 2.5 million this year. Sri Lanka became a place of attraction particularly after the civil war ended in May 2009.

Sri Lanka takes third place in RTI global ranking
Following the announcement of rules and regulations on Right Information Act by Minister of Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Gayantha Karunatilleke last week, Sri Lanka has reached third best place in the RTI global ranking. Mexico and Serbia are in the first and second places.
Simultaneously Sri Lanka becomes the best in South Asia, by passing India says Canadians based RTI watchdog Centre for Law and Democracy (CLD)
Countries often go up a few points on the RTI rating when they adopt rules and regulations. But this is an impressive jump up for a country which already had a very strong score, so both the minister and the commission deserve to be congratulated for their good work,  CLDs Executive Director Toby Mendel was quoted in its website www.law-democracy.org.
When the bill was unanimously adopted in Parliament last August, Sri Lanka was in the seventh place of global ranking and then dropped into the ninth place. However, the new regulations of the act has added ten more points to Sri Lanka which brought it to the third best place in its global ranking.
The rules and regulations were gazette last week by the Minister in concurrence of the RTI Commission in Sri Lanka.
The implementation of the act was commenced on February 3rd and countrywide public authorities had received more than 300 RTI applications on the first working day of the week.
This is significant achievement for Sri Lanka. And also this is just a beginning of a long journey. We will do our best to establish good governance and democracy in this country, says Minister Gayantha Karunatilleke.
