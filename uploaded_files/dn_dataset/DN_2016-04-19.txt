Ethical dilemma of the  public service
Corruption, fraud, illegal conduct and other types of unethical activity have characterised our public sector during the last regime. There is little doubt that different types of unethical behaviour have contributed significantly to increased cynicism and scepticism by the larger public. This trend is evident in the current growing public concern over the unethical conduct of political leaders and senior public officials. It has also resulted in a resurgence of interest in ethics in our public sector.
Let me begin this brief paper by providing a backdrop to understanding the emergence of public sector ethics as an important focus in public policy, and thereafter discuss how we could resolve the crisis about the lack of public trust in public officials and public organisations.
First let us ask ourselves, as common citizens what do we expect from our public service and how would we define the specific characteristics of public service
We expect from a public servant to achieve three fundamental objectives: (1) manage public resources effectively and their usage properly accounted for, (2) will not use the public resources for partisan political purposes or for personal advantage, (3) maintain ethically high standard of behaviour right throughout.
Given these public expectations, how should we define the specific characteristics of an ethical public service (1) first, there should be clear, ethical standards of behaviour and professionalism that public servants understand and must comply with, (2) second, there should be a high level of confidence among stakeholders - Government, Parliament, and the public - that these standards are being complied with, and (3) third, the level of confidence is reinforced by internal and external systems of accountability that can evaluate and report on ethical standards and also can detect and deal effectively with lapses.
At present, these values have been enshrined and elucidated in various public administrative and financial regulations governing the conduct of public servants, covering a whole gamut of subjects. If so, what then went wrong in the public sector There is growing recognition that, despite significant increases in resourcing, public service delivery is still failing in Sri Lanka.
Political and governance factors may offer at least some part of the explanation. A stronger evidence base is needed to address these factors, with greater cross country analysis that identifies some of the most common political economy constraints and incentive problems, and draws out lessons for how they can be overcome.
Change
We are often told that decades ago, our public sector was a place of prestige and honour accepted as one of the best in Asia. What we witness today is a public sector with lethargy, corruption, extravagance and irregularities and all at the expense of common citizens.
Unfortunately, even in the last one-and-half years, a very few measures have been taken to curtail or reduce this. The excuse we hear often is that the higher-ups are corrupt and therefore nothing could be done. In this circumstance, before making major changes, the first step is the need to change the attitude of the public servants giving them strict work ethics which must be followed from the top-down.
The key word is change and that means not only the mind-set and attitude of public servants but also work norms, systems. There is no magic potion to create that much needed change. All that is required is the willingness and the acceptance that something is amiss and that it should be addressed with an appropriate action plan. We may think of flatter internal structures, delegation of operational authority, simplified processes, better communication channels, ability for the public to address their grievances etc.
Neutrality
There are factors unique to the Public Service that require officials to make decisions about ethical matters on a regular basis. The requirement for political neutrality is a particular example of the importance of perception. While senior public servants must give unstinting support to their Ministers they must at the same time provide thoroughly impartial advice to the Government.
The duty to provide free and frank advice raises some ethical dilemmas. Officials need to balance short and long-term considerations and the wider public interest, and aim for the broadest possible view of any given situation. The bottom line is that Ministers make and bear responsibility for policy decisions, while officials bear responsibility for the advice they provide to them.
Controls
This complex operational environment in which public servants now work is providing fertile ground for ethical dilemmas to surface. It is against these backdrop that we need to find solutions to create a suitable model that minimises the forces, and processes confronting the public servant.

Ethics in the public sector can be created if all the various external bodies and forces which monitor and bring into the public gaze the operation of the public sector are strengthened and protected.
There are the formal bodies such as the parliament, especially its committee system, offices and the opposition political parties. An independent judicial system is also vital and the new administrative law system.
External to the public sector is the civil society and a web of interests and NGOs, who can employ their own experts to scrutinise public behaviour and policy. There is a sceptical probing mass media, social media, the Internet, the web and the blogs.
All these keep public opinion informed and help to bring pressure upon politicians, government and public servants. In any society there is a sense of what is right and wrong in the public sphere. There are principles which the citizen expects to be adhered to.
The scrutiny of independent bodies with knowledge of the policy area and the ability to mobilise and inform public opinions is important to retain citizen trust in the ethics of the public sector.
There is internal audit and an external Auditor General. Performance targets, the management of the department and enforcement of rules and codes of conduct are all under the departmental head. These procedures and processes can be important devices for maintaining ethics.
The openness and transparency of processes can inspire trust in citizens. This is especially if full information is provided, and participation encouraged which is not just a public relations exercise. Open impartial public inquiries with hearings and citizen and stakeholders submissions engender trust.
Whistle blower legislation is also often considered an important means of ensuring transparency. Youre a whistle-blower if youre a public official and you report certain types of wrongdoing.
This will usually be something youve seen at work - though not always.
The wrongdoing you disclose must be in the public interest. This means it must affect others, eg the general public. As a whistle-blower youre protected by law - you wouldnt be treated unfairly or lose your job because you blow the whistle.
Education
Some argue simply that the best way to ensure ethics among public servants is to recruit ethical people into the public service. Certainly there is some truth to that. Can we teach it as they join the public service Then the question arises as to how much we should put ethics into their study curriculum.
That is, how much difference will it make Can we really "create" ethical people In the end, isn't ethics like so many other things--something that they bring with them upon entry to the programs
Perhaps. But given how much the effectiveness of government is compromised when even one public servant violates the public's trust, it does seem to be worth the effort to attempt to sensitize both current and potential public servants to the differences between ethical and unethical behavior.

Why Sri Lanka needs a new Police Act
With the end of the three-decade long armed conflict in 2009, Sri Lanka has embarked in seeking permanent peace and human security in the country through reconciliation, rehabilitation and reconstruction. This will help not only bridging the gaps between ethnic communities in Sri Lanka but also in overall socioeconomic and political development of nation building. Since the new government came into power on January 8th 2015, there is a big hope that countrys supreme law will be change and more powers given to citizens of the nation. The Government of Sri Lanka is currently underway to introduce a new constitution to Sri Lanka with the help and consultation of the citizens and the civil society. This is commendable. In the same manner it is important to have in post-war Sri Lanka, a new Police Act and a new Firearms Act which will directly support the achievement of permanent peace and stability and thereby achieve higher human security status in future of Sri Lanka.
During the British Colonial period the Police Ordinance No. 16 of 1865 was enacted to stipulate powers and responsibilities of policemen. This was called An Ordinance to Provide for the Establishment and Regulation of a Police Force in Ceylon. In 1866, William Robert Campbell then the Chief of Police in the Indian province of Rathnageri, was appointed as Chief Superintendent of Police in Ceylon to be in charge of the Ceylon Police Force on 3rd September 1866. Therefore, this date is considered to be the beginning of the Sri Lanka Police Service.
From 1865, various amendments were made to the Police Ordinance until No. 32 of 1947. In 1974 Police Ordinance became Law No. 3 of 1974. In 1949, Sri Lanka introduced Police Act No. 15 of 1949. Until 1984, there were 6 amendments to the Act and last was the Police Act No. 41 of 1984. Since 1984, (more than three decades now) there were no amendments to the Police Act of Sri Lanka.

This shows that Sri Lanka has failed to introduce a new Police Act to the country mainly due to domestic changes particular after the war and to meet the international standards of the police service of Sri Lanka. In 2016 the Department of Police will celebrate its 150th anniversary.
Within the Police Department there are several issues to be addressed. It is very important make sure that the Police Department gets adequate resources to carry out its duties in terms of quality human resources and adequate infrastructure facilities. Use of the latest technology will improve the quality of services as well as confidence building among the general public toward the Police Department. At the same time a police officer (from constable level) should have a reasonable salary and other perks and also a good welfare package. Some may argue that this will be a burden to the government but when it carefully studies this it will be evident that it will bring various benefits to the society at large. In developed countries the highest salaries are paid to police officers equal to that of professionals or sometime it may higher. At the same time to become a police officer is a difficult task in those developed countries.
Why Sri Lanka Needs a New Firearms Act
The Firearms Ordinance No 33 of 1916 was introduced during the British colonial period. Since 1st April 1917, the Ordinance amended at ten occasions until the last Act No 22 of 1996.
There are various provisions under the Act No. 22 of 1996 that are out dated as well as new provisions need to be amended for todays context. In the last two decades there were no amendments to the Firearms Act which is a serious concern for human security in post-war Sri Lanka.
Various types of illegal automatic weapons and others are circulating in post-war Sri Lanka but the existing Fire Arms Act has very minimal charges when the authorities found those weapons. Some weapons were not clearly stipulated in the existing Act. This means that Sri Lankas commitment is minimal towards the apprehension of illegal weapons and the illegal weapons industry in a post-war setting. The Amended Firearms Act No. 22 of 1996 is a completely outdated Act in todays context. In 2016, the Firearms Act will reach 100th year anniversary which is a totally outdated Act for future Sri Lanka.
During and after Southern insurgency (1971 and 1988) and three decades of armed conflict between Sri Lankas security forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) in North and East of Sri Lanka, the countrys politicians and civilians received large numbers of firearms by various means. But it seems none of them were handed back to the government. Post-war Sri Lanka is still unable to carry out a comprehensive small arms survey with wider public participation to apprehend such illegal arms possessed by civilians and underworld gangs actively operating in the country. Most of the weapons received by them tic weapons and this shows the severe danger of the situation.
Various killings take place using such automatic weapons which undermine human security. There is no doubt that this will hinder the socioeconomic development and freedom of political participation in post-war Sri Lanka.
Before finalizing a new Police Act and a new Firearms Act there should be a broader public discussion including civil society, academia, professionals and relevant stakeholders.

Divided May Day rally will only benefit UNP: Lakshman
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has taken a decision to hold the party May Day rally in Galle. It will proceed with the decision although several parties are attempting to go separately, Science, Technology and Research State Minister Lakshman Seneviratne said.

Addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday, Seneviratne said if a party member wants to hold a May Day rally separately that would bring direct benefit to the United National Party (UNP) as the party would split into two.
Hence, it would be considered as a statement made with some other intention which is not supportive to the party. No true party member would initiate such an act, Seneviratne added.
The present leader of the SLFP is none other than present President Maithripala Sirisena. It is former President Mahinda Rajapaksa himself who offered the leadership to him to maintain the unity of the party. Therefore, party members should act according to the decisions taken by the leader of the party. There cannot be two leaders in the SLFP, he said.
The minister added that the Party Working Committee will take action against members who would go against Party rules.
Questioned whether the same rules are applied to the former President, the minister said the present President will hold a discussion with Rajapaksa before taking any action against him.
