England outplay Sri Lanka by 122 runs in final ODI

England outclassed Sri Lanka to win the final one-day international by a hefty 122 runs last night, ensuring it didnt lose a game to the Sri Lankans through the entire tour.
Having won the five-match ODI series already, England made it 3-0 in the last game at Sophia Gardens to follow up a 2-0 test series win.
Joe Root made 93 to lead England to 324-7 batting first. Seamers David Willey and Liam Plunkett then shared seven wickets as Sri Lanka was bowled out for 202 in 42.4 overs for another heavy defeat.
Root was backed up by a typically blistering 70 off 45 balls from Jos Buttler, who was in inventive form as he played sweeps and scoop shots on his way to seven fours and a six.
James Vince responded to his call-up to the team with a half-century at the top of the innings. Vince and Jason Roy put on 67 for the opening wicket, and Root and Buttler combined for 109 for the fifth wicket.
Root was out first ball of the final over seeking his century, but England was always in control after posting its big score.
Sri Lanka struggled in the field after winning the toss and deciding to put England in to bat. Part-time bowler Danushka Gunathilaka had the best figures with 3-48 to underline Sri Lankas poor performance with the ball.
Dinesh Chandimal made 53 and Gunathilaka 48 but they barely slowed Englands charge to victory.
Plunkett, who finished with 3-44, picked up Gunathilaka lbw and Sri Lankan wickets tumbled regularly from there.
Chandimal was second-last man out as Willey beat him to knock back his middle stump. Willey also claimed Nuwan Pradeeps wicket to seal the victory and give the seamer career-best figures in one-dayers of 4-34.
The closest Sri Lanka came to winning a game on the tour was the tied first ODI. Sri Lanka should have won that, but Plunkett hit a six off the final ball to save a tie for England.
