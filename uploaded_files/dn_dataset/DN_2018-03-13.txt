Anti-dumping, safeguarding acts vital to protect domestic industry
Two much awaited bills relating to international trade - Anti-Dumping & Countervailing Act and the Safeguard Measures Act were passed in Parliament.
This will provide domestic industries with a robust framework to guard against unfair trade practices and unforeseen surges of imports. Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama said that the enactment of these two laws was long overdue in Sri Lanka as many countries both developed and developing including India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh had already enacted required domestic legislation.
While we grow our trade with the rest of the world and forge ahead with trade liberalisation, we have not forgotten the need to look after the interests of our own industries here at home.
The acts passed by Parliament are vital to protect domestic industry from unfair trade practices. However these new laws are not aimed at providing blanket protectionism to the domestic industry, but rather a credible set of remedial measures in the event of injury to the domestic industry caused by dumping, or by subsidisation, or by sudden surges of imports. The primary purpose is to re-establish fair competition and to provide the domestic industry a level playing field, not promote protectionism. The local industry has been making representations that imports are being made at lower prices than the normal value into the country.
Furthermore, Sri Lanka is in the process of rationalization of its tariff regime and will also phase out Custom duties on imports under the Free Trade Agreements. With these developments there can be tendency to resort to dumping or subsidization of their goods into Sri Lanka, thereby creating a unfair competition and injury to domestic industry.
The anti-dumping or countervailing measures or safeguard measures do not aim at providing protection to the domestic industry per se. These are only remedial measures for removal of injury to the domestic industry caused by the dumping or subsidisation or surges of imports of goods.
The bill passed define specific criteria to determine when product is to be consider dumped and provide provision to levy compensate duties on import of products that are benefiting from dumping or subsidization.
Following an investigation based on submission made by domestic industry to the Department of Commerce, it will make a preliminary determination and thereafter final determination on whether to impose anti dumping duty, if it is established that imports have caused injury to domestic industry. The procedures will also allow both interested parties as well as affected parties to present their submission and their case before the authority.
In addition to anti  dumping, the section on countervailing and subsidies will provide provision to take remedial measures against other unfair trade practices, because apart from dumping, countries also resort to the subsidization of their exports to Sri Lanka.
Subsidies that are granted by other countries to their exporters which are categorized as actionable subsidies will be addressed by way of levying anti  subsidy countervailing duty equivalent to subsidy granted, after investigation and determination.
This Ministry wishes to state that continuation of a distorted Import tariff regime will not make domestic industry internationally competitive.
This Ministry, as a part of economic development strategy and new National Trade Policy, will be entering into Free Trade Agreements at bilateral level particularly with growing large economies such as India and China which are progressing well.

Ignorance of policies leads to rise in child abuse
According to the current child-protection legislation, a person is even prohibited from patting a child. Since most teachers are unaware of this provision, serious acts of child abuse are taking place in government, as well as international schools today, Stop Child Cruelty Chairperson Thush Wickremenayake said. Although stringent child-protection laws are in existence today, their non-introduction to schools has caused a major issue.
Therefore, formulation of a school-level child protection policy has become an urgent need, she said. Wickremenayake, who said the future of a country or nation depended on its child generation, said development of moral and social values within schools were more important than making children enslaved to technology.
Wickremenayake was addressing a press conference held at the Wellawatte Womens Research Institute, recently, explaining the factors which led her to found the Stop Child Cruelty organisation. Wickremenayake said her daughter attended a private school in Negombo. When her daughter was subjected to an alleged case of cruelty in that school, she lodged complaints with every possible institution regarding it. Finally, National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) representatives visited the school for an investigation. Pressure was exerted from a higher echelon, asking them to halt the investigation, but the authority continued.
When such influence is exerted, a further injustice is caused to the affected party. When she had complained to the President about it, he had asked her to lodge a complaint with the Human Rights Commission.
It was like falling from the frying pan and into the fire, because a certain female officer had allegedly taken the entire file home.
Wickremenayake alleged that since that officer was a relative of a child of the same school, she had allegedly informed the school authorities about the complaint and this had posed a threat to the identity of her daughter.
This motivated her to launch an organisation to protect children's rights, named Stop Child Cruelty.

Kandy incidents caused huge economic loss
The recent turmoil in Kandy has caused a tremendous economic loss to the country. The daily influx of tourists has drastically petered out due to this problem, Highways and Higher Education Minister Kabir Hashim said.
The Minister was addressing a meeting attended by members of Mawanella, Hemmathagma and Aranayake Civil Defence Committees held at the Mawanella Divisional Secretariat on March 11.
Minister Hashim said when there is unrest in any part of the country, tourists who visit Sri Lanka are unable to venture out of their hotels. Furthermore, tourist arrivals trickle down due to adverse tour advisories issued by foreign countries to their nationals. This resulted in a corresponding loss of business to hotels and shops posing a threat to their owners and employees, he said.
Recently, there was information that a certain hotel had encountered a cancellation of about thousand bookings on account of the Kandy incident. The loss caused to the countrys economy is common to all citizens, irrespective of their community or religion, he added.
People would have to encounter additional tax burdens. When this kind of unrest go out of control, innocent people too are dragged in to it causing problems to the entire country. Every one should try to prevent small incidents from mushrooming into big issues by helping the police to maintain law and order in their areas, he said.

People show high interest in receiving information under RTI
Sri Lanka College of Journalism Director and RTI Task Force Member Shan Wijethunga said that about 1,500 applications are sent to the relevant authorities every month to get information under the Right to Information Act,
He was addressing a workshop organised by the Finance and Mass Media Ministry at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel yesterday to develop an RTI Public Outreach Campaign and Resource Centre in Sri Lanka.
Citing India as a success story of RTI implementation, he said that about 4,800 RTI applications are filed every day in India seeking information on matters of public interest.
He pointed out the RTI could be used as a tool to keep tab on good governance and correct the Government where necessary.
The right of access to information held by public authorities is a guaranteed fundamental right of any Sri Lankan under 19th amendment to the Constitution. Parliament adopted the right to information Act No 12 of 2016 (RTI Act), which gives the legal framework for access to information held by public authorities. The RTI Act came into the force on August 4, 2016.
Sudarma Karunarathna said that giving the right of access to information would allow people to participate more in matters that affect the public life. She said the RTI training courses should focus on the Act as a fundamental right and its purpose.
The RTI unit assigns staff to establish and maintain its official website, the resource centre and the help desk. The resource centre acquires reference materials, training modules, literature on experiences from other countries.
She said that this strategic implementation is divided into nine interlocking goals. They include building institutional capacities, creating conditions to implement the RTI law, training information officers and public officials, streamlining RTI across the public, revising inhibiting laws, fostering proactive disclosure, improving record management, encouraging reuse of public information and raising public awareness.
The Ministry promotes the public understanding on the RTI Act via its website, holding and supporting public events including commemoration of the RTI Day, and taking measures to raise RTI literacy among the students.
It encourages to include the RTI in the university courses on media and journalism while supporting to produce audio and videos on the RTI via outreach campaigns of other ministries to educate people about the RTI. It supports the efforts of civil society organisations to educate urban and rural populations in this regard.
Finance and Mass Media Ministry Additional Secretary Thilaka Jayasundara, USAID Sri Lanka Office of Governance and Vulnerable Populations Director Danielle Reiff, Development Communication Specialist Nalaka Gunawardene, National Media Centre Director Jagath Liyanarachchi and Finance and Mass Media Ministry Director J.W.S.Kithsiri participated.

Rough weather back to normalcy tomorrow
The existing inclement weather in seas and around the country would come back to normal tomorrow, Disaster Management Ministry Secretary Dr. S Amalanathan yesterday said.
He said the low pressure area located to the South of the country is likely to develop further and move towards the Arabian sea and this process would bring the weather to normalcy.
He made these observation at a press conference held at the Ministry Auditorium.
He added that showers or thunder showers with cloudy conditions are expected to continue over most parts of the island and surrounding sea areas.
Meteorological Department Acting Director General Athula Karunanayake said that fairly strong gusty winds up to 45-50 kmph can be expected, particularly over North Centeal Province and in the Galle and Matara districts. He added that the fairly heavy rainfalls of 75-100 mm can be expected in the Southern, Uva and Eastern Provinces and in the Matale and Polonnaruwa districts. He added that there may be temporary localised strong winds during thunder showers.
"The general public is requested to take adequate precautions to minimise damages caused by lightning activity," Karunanayake said.
Fisheries Ministry Additional Director Padmapriya Thisera said that sudden wind up to 70 to 80 kmph and sudden roughness in the sea areas off the coast extending from Mannar to Pottuvil via Colombo and Galle will be high.
He added showers will occur at times in the sea areas around the island. "Fishermen are advised not to venture into these seas during next 36 hours," he said. "Naval communities are requested to be vigilant," he said.

Punishment for offences committed by children
Age limit raised from 8 to 12
The age limit of 8 years under which no act of a child is considered an offence is to be increased to 12 years shortly by way of an Amendment to the Penal Code.
The Government last Friday gazetted a bill to amend the Chapter 19 of Penal Code to give effect to the above revision of the age limit.
According to the Bill Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under 12 years of age.
Nothing is an offence which is done by a child above twelve years of age and under fourteen, if the judge is of the opinion that he has not attained sufficient maturity to understand the nature and consequences of his act.
If the child, who committed the offence, is between 12 and 14 years of age, law enforcement authorities must consult the discretion of a Magistrate to determine whether the child has the required degree of maturity to commit an offence.
In order to facilitate this revision of law, the Government last Friday also gazetted an amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure to insert a new section to enable the officer in charge of a police station to direct a child between 12 and 14, alleged to have committed an offence, to be examined by a Government medical officer or other expert in the relevant field in order to assist the Magistrate to form his opinion on the maturity of understanding of such child. It must be done with the consent of the parent or guardian of the child.
The two Bills have been gazetted by the Justice Ministry and those will be presented for Parliament approval by Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala.
The Cabinet approval for the amendments was granted last month.
The move to increase the minimum age of criminal responsibility was after considering the opinions of psychologists and other experts on the subject. Government authorities said the expert view of the psychologists and other specialists is that the current minimum age of 8 years is too young to be subjected to criminal responsibility.

According to reliable sources, the aircraft parts had been purchased from a private aviation operator. However, there is no evidence so far to prevent anyone from purchasing aircraft parts unless they threatens national security or are in the air.
The Air Force Spokesman said they had not been notified of the incident. Civil Aviation Director General H.M.C. Nimalsiri said the country has no definite regulations pertaining to the possession of aircraft parts.
"It is considered an offence to import aircraft parts without a licence.

Arsenal beat Watford 3-0
LONDON, Sunday: Arsenal eased their way past Watford 3-0 in the Premier League on Sunday, marking their first clean sheet in 12 league matches and settling nerves at the Emirates after a string of losses in 2018.
The win leaves Arsenal 10 points off Champions League qualification in sixth place in the standings, while Watford stay in 10th.
It was a convincing win. It gets us out of that negative spiral that we were in, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told reporters.
Prior to their midweek 2-0 away win over AC Milan in the Europa League, the Gunners had lost four games in a row in all competitions, including back-to-back 3-0 drubbings by runaway Premier League leaders Manchester City.
In one week we got from hell to heaven, Wenger said.
Arsenals German defender Shkodran Mustafi opened the scoring in the eighth minute, heading home from a Mesut Ozil free kick for his third goal of the season and the home sides 1,000th of the Premier League era.
Watford pressed Arsenal back into their own area as the first half came to a close, but they were unable to equalise.
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang doubled the lead just short of the hour mark, running onto a pass from former Borussia Dortmund team mate Henrikh Mkhitaryan and rounding the keeper to slot the ball home. - Agencies

In awe of Sidewalk Broadway
Extracts from the Dr. Gamini Haththotuwegama Memorial Lecture delivered by Nihal Rajapakse at OPA Auditorium on the invitation of Richmond 60-70 Group.
Wikipedia describes Dr. Gamini Haththotuwegama in the following manner.
He was a Sri Lankan playwright, director, actor, critic and educator. He is widely known as the father of modern street theatre. He is among the most influential directors of post independent Sri Lanka.
Therefore it is quite obvious that it was with considerable trepidation that I accepted the invitation because I am neither an academic nor a playwright nor anyone who has anything do with DramSoc viz drama and theatre and much less an orator! The only oratory Ive ever practised was in 1970 when I was appointed as Senior Lecturer of the Staff Training School of my former employer, Peoples Bank. That too was for a period of less than one year. As lecturing was not my forte, I asked for a transfer which was granted.
G.K. was about four years my senior in school and therefore I do not consider myself as one of his mango friends. However, we have one thing in common. He was a student at Richmond for 13 years (from 1942 to 1954) whilst I was a student there for 12 years (from 1947 to 1958.) Therefore, both of us are full blooded products of that famous institution called Richmond College. Further, among my peers in the banking sector, I was often categorized as a rebel without a cause. The only difference between G.K. and myself is that G.K. is a rebel with a cause! For those in the audience who do not know me, I am a Chartered Banker having spent almost my entire working life in the banking industry.
Charismatic personality
As many of you know, banking and drama do not go together. The only time in my living memory that drama and banking got mixed up were the recent drama over the Treasury Bond issue involving the Central Bank of Sri Lanka which in my view was much more than just a drama! Coming back to the life and times of this charismatic personality called G.K. de Silva or simply as G.K. as he was popularly known in school, it was in or about 1960, while attached to the tutorial staff at Richmond after his graduation, that he decided to shed the last vestiges of colonialism from him and decided to revert to his ancestral name, Haththotuwegama.
Hereinafter, with due respect to him and for purposes of simplification, I shall refer to him simply as G.K. as he was better known to us in school. I shall concentrate mostly on his school life because these are the areas I have a first-hand knowledge of him.
Had G.K. been alive, he would have been 79-years-old today. I am not going to dwell at length about his family background except to add a few anecdotes. This area was already been covered by the Chief Guest in her lecture. G.Ks initials stand for Gamini Kalyanadharsha. His family comprised of eight children- two boys and six girls. G.K. was the third. According to his own confession, he was by far the most mischievous of the children so much so that during school holidays, his father used to carter him away from home and place him under the care of his relations in Akuressa or Matara so that the parents could give due care to his other seven siblings.
His father used to bring him back home only after school holidays are over. Singing was the passion of the entire family. Even without a radio, the family used to sing regularly so much so that those neighbours who had radios, used to switch them off and listen to the music emanating from the Haththotuwegama household! I knew both boys; his younger brother Srinivasa or Jeffrey as he was popularly known, was a contemporary of mine and a brilliant science student who entered the University in 1959 and qualified as an engineer.
He has been domiciled in New Zealand for quite some time. I have never met him since leaving school. To me, the most inspirational member of the Haththotuwegama family is G.Ks elder sister, Iranganie.
She had a profound influence on my education. Out of the four subjects I studied for the University Entrance and H.S.C. Examinations of 1958, she tutored me in three of them, viz; Ceylon History, European History and Government. She had throughout been a very dedicated teacher. Her tutoring was of such high quality that I was quite confident that Ill gain admission to the University without much difficulty. Therefore, in 1958 after sitting for this examination for the very first time, I left school and was preparing to enter the University. However, when the results were announced lo and behold! I had failed in one subject thereby failing to gain admission to the University but passed the H.S.C. Examination.
However, less than six months later in May/June 1959, when I sat for the G.C.E. (Adv. Level) Examination of the University of London, which is equivalent to University Intermediate level, I passed in all three subjects and became eligible to proceed with the Degree course of study. All I used for this examination was the study material provided by Miss Haththotuwegama at Richmond which speaks volumes about the quality of her teaching skills. I shall make use of this opportunity to pay my homage to her for the immense contribution she has made to my life although it is more than half a century late!
Great teachers
Coming back to the subject under discussions, like his father and uncles, G.K. had almost his entire education at Richmond from 1942 up to the time he entered the University of Peradeniya in 1955. During this time, his first love, outside his family, of course, was Richmond.
During his early days at Richmond, he came under the benign influence of great teachers like Major Adhihetty, a strict disciplinarian, who always insisted students to have a short cropped hairstyle and walk with chest forward. Then there is that much-respected Principal, E.R. de Silva who will walk into a class without any notice and deliver a short lecture, be it English, Sinhala, Maths or Science.
Towards the latter part of his student days at Richmond G.K. came under the tutorage of Clara Nanayakkara, Daphne Dissanayake (whose daughter incidentally is a leading Cardiologist and mine as well, named Naomali Amarasena), Then there was that debonair trio of Messrs. J.H. Ariaratnam, Walter May and, Shelton Abeysuriya all of them straight from the university. G.Ks tutors at HSC level was probably Thampoe, Daphne Dissanayake, J H Ariaratnam, Walter May and that fiery S.K. Goonawardene (brother of the LSSP ideologue, Cholmondeley Goonawardene of Kalutara).
There is no doubt that G.K.s love for music was largely influenced by iconic figures like Shelton Wirasinha and Ivor de Silva. In my view, his leaning towards the left and his anti-colonial beliefs coupled with his critical and inquiring mind may have been greatly nurtured by some of these teachers in his Upper School at Richmond. This also would have paved the way for the development of his creative thinking abilities which blossomed in him after he joined the University. By his very nature, until his death in 2009, he remained a non-conformist and a maverick. To what extent Richmond contributed to such a development is a matter for debate.
I have to mention another important facet of the life of G.K. There is no doubt in my mind that he remained an avowed anti-imperialist and anti-colonial throughout his life but was NOT anti- West. Let me elucidate this point. Firstly, G.K. remained faithful to his original dress code which was shirt and trouser throughout. He never changed his attire to Ariya Sinhala or Kapati Suit worn by politicians.
Secondly, the inspiration for most of his works originated from Western Literature. For example from Greek mythology, (Agamemnon), Checkov and Dostoyevsky of Russia, Brecht of Germany and above all, Shakespeare of England and even Tennessee Williams of the U.S. Thirdly, in one of his interviews, he articulated that the J.V.P. Insurrection of 1971 failed because they neglected and/or failed to enlist the support of the English educated middle-class elite towards their cause. Take the people who were charged with the Insurrection. They were all Sinhala educated youth. On this score, history was on G.Ks side.
Major upheavals in world history
Take the major upheavals in world history. The French Revolution of 1789 was successful because its inspiration and leadership came from the intellectual community from persons like Voltaire, Montesquieu, Rousseau and Robespierre. It was Montesquieu who propounded the doctrine of separation of powers which later remained the bedrock of the U.S. Constitution. Then came Rousseaus famous publication, Social Contract, which hit France like a time bomb and gave the much-needed impetus for the Revolution. This book starts with the famous words, Everyman is born free but is everywhere in chains. Then look at the Russian Revolution of 1917. It was led by intellectuals like Lenin and Trotsky.
Even the more recent Cuban Revolution of 1957 was also led by intellectuals like Dr. Fidel Castro and Ernesto Che Guevara. Therefore there is considerable truth in G.Ks assertion that the JVP Insurrection of 1971 failed due to their failure to entice the English educated middle class for their movement. After all, he was a Lecturer in English in both Universities of Kelaniya and Peradeniya. He was thinking probably in English. Therefore, G.K. somewhere in his heart has had some soft corner for the English educated middle class of the country and certainly not anti-West in his outlook. That is my candid opinion. I leave it entirely to the audience to decide whether or not G.K. was anti-West.
G.K. got involved in most of the extracurricular activities in school, viz; the Debating Team, School Choir and Theatre, the Cheering Squad etc. In sports he never went beyond the Cheering Squad and as an announcer in sports meets but remained a keen cricket enthusiast.
During his young days, he used to walk up to the house of our mutual friend, Ananda Jayasinghe who is here with us today, to listen to the cricket commentaries of Christopher Martin Jenkins in the Ashes series.
Further, when he joined Kelaniya University as a Lecturer, he not only introduced cricket to the University but even became their cricket coach! He was in the S.S.C. Prep Form when he was selected for the College Debating Team along with youngster Stanley Wickremaratne. As a junior, I remember having seen Merchant of Venice, which was produced and directed by Ariaratnam and Tampoe. In this play, he gave a stellar performance as Shylock. He was also the Editor of the School Magazine for three years. Following his brilliant academic career, he was made a Prefect in or about 1953.

CIM SLs first CEOs Forum discusses WFP, private sector engagement
CIM Sri Lanka held its first CEOs Breakfast Forum for 2018 recently discussing a topical theme of the private sectors role in the pressing challenges of climate change, food security and the way forward.
The Speaker at the event was Brenda Barton, World Food Programmes (WFP) Representative and Country Director who was assisted by Laksiri Nanayakkara, WFP Food Security Analyst. The forum was moderated by Nisthar Cassim, Editor, Daily Financial Times, Wijeya Newspapers Ltd.
Drawing on her vast experience, Brenda Barton spoke on syncing human rights and businesses. She said, In many countries businesses are reducing inequality, promoting peace and ensuring the prosperity and protection of the planet as a corner stone in their corporate value chain.
Explaining WFPs role, Barton added, As the WFP we have a special affinitive towards the business community, as to help solve global hunger we need to work with the private sector and with civil society. We need you to partner with us with technology, tools, and together with the business sector to be hand in hand.
We can share and exchange information in a much better way so as to have a better outcome for the communities.
Laksiri Nanayakkara explained to the audience, WFPs initiative Platforms for Real-time Information Systems (PRISM) which is used to understand the effects of a disaster in order to help launch a faster, more effective response to reach those in need.
He explained how the open source WFP platform uses pool data to help the Government, UN Partners, and NGOs to prepare and respond in the event of a disaster.
Nanayakkara said, It is a system that in the future everyone can access freely. However, he noted, Sri Lanka has to have a better plan and preparedness using new technology for businesses to adapt and be prepared for disasters.
During the thought provoking panel discussion Nisthar Cassim as moderator, discussed WFPs experience in engaging and consultation with the private sector. Commenting on this Barton said, It has to be part of the wider partnership.
There are policies, planning, welfare projects etc., but they are not sufficient. Challenges cannot be solved by Government and UN agencies alone, the business community must play a part.
Barton urged the audience, It is a win-win situation because there are business opportunities. We are going to launch a movement and everybody has to be involved with their own collective actions. It has to be organic, everyone who cares about the issue, should step forward and be part of the solution. We are hoping to create an opportunity for everyone to be engaged and bring their own individual solutions to the table.
Commenting on WFPs ongoing plans Barton concluded, What is needed is effective agriculture and how we can work towards it. We are speaking with the government on how the corporate sector can come in, and looking at having a business advisory board. We want businesses to be part of the process to help change and save lives.
CIM is the largest community of professional marketers in the world with 100 years of heritage.

CIMA hosts seminar on Foreign Exchange Act
CIMA Sri Lanka conducted a seminar on the new Foreign Exchange Act No. 12 of 2017 on the recently at the BMICH, Colombo recently.
The seminar included presentations by Udeni P Alawattage, Director of Department Foreign Exchange who provided an overview of the financial system of Sri Lanka and the new Act and Suresh R.I. Perera, Principal  Tax & Regulatory, KPMG. Thiswas followed by a panel discussion.
Alawattage in delivering his presentation highlighted the policy rationale for the introduction of the foreign exchange act and also the key changes vis a vis the Exchange Control Act. Alawattage provided a brief outline on the changes to the accounts and the limits for outward remittance.
Suresh Perera covered many areas of the new Act including new Accounts, Capital and current transactions, the identification of a resident, import and export of foreign currency and Sri Lankan currency, amnesty provision, holding of foreign exchange in possession, and the administrative and penal provisions among others.
Perera also pointed out in his presentation that the Schedule B of the Board of Investment Law includes the Exchange Control Act and has not been amended to include the Foreign Exchange Act. Hence, the BOI are not able to extend the relaxations under foreign exchange regime to the investors.
Perera mentioned that when resolving the issue in relation to the BOI both existing agreements that have already been granted exchange relaxations under the exchange control Act and also the new agreements entered in to post the introduction of the new foreign exchange Act should be looked in to.
The presentations were followed by a lively and informative panel discussion with eminent personalities from the industry including Renuka Weerakoon, Executive Director, Board of Investment, Shanaz Kamileen, Assistant Controller of Exchange, and Pavithri Vithanage, Senior Assistant Director, Legal and Compliance Department, CBSL, ManiqueKiriella Bandara, Compliance Officer at National Development Bank PLC and both the speakers. The panel session was moderated by Rifka Ziyard, Associate Director, Tax & Regulatory, KPMG.
Initiating the panel discussion, Ziyard mentioned that the new foreign exchange act has led to additional compliance burden on the Authorized Dealers and the regulator will emphasize on providing guidance to the Authorized Dealers and others.
In response to the Moderators comments, Manique Bandara agreed that there is additional work for the Authorized dealers and emphasized that implementation of any new Act is not without its challenges. She said the key is to work between the parameters and guidelines given.
Renuka Weerakoon clarified the position of companies with BOI agreements in relation to the Act. She stated that as the Foreign Exchange Act is not covered in Schedule B of the BOI law, such companies are subject to the provisions of the new Act. However, the BOI is in process of consultations in order to include the Foreign Exchange Act under Schedule B of the BOI Law.
In response to a question from the audience, Pavithri Vithanage stated that individuals in Sri Lanka are allowed to invest in any company outside Sri Lanka with the exception of cryptocurrencies.
She also stated that as the Act is principle based, it is imperative to exercise judgement and rationality in the interpretation and application of the Act.
In relation to a questions from the moderator whether the legal tender of Sri Lanka has changed, Alawattage stated that the legal tender of the country is still the Sri Lankan rupee Perera enlightened the audience on the reason for the ambiguity is due to Section 5 of the FEA, where it states that payments can be made using foreign currency within or outside Sri Lankathrough an authorized dealer. This conflict with Section 4 of the Monetary Law Act and Mr. Perera stated that as per the presumption the new Act should prevail.
Further Shaanaz Kamileen responding to a question from the audience, mentioned that trusts are not identified as persons eligible to invest outside Sri Lanka. If one considers the beneficiaries of the trust to be individuals, they will be subject to the lifetime limit of USD 200,000.
In relation to the amnesty, Alawattage mentioned that currently the Central bank is in discussion with the Inland Revenue Department and that a process will be documented and shared.

To survive in peace and harmony needs a strong unity
Peace and harmony are much important. Everyone who experienced a three-decade of war knows it. First of all every individual, regardless of religion, and race, should realize that we are all humans with the circulation of red blood in our veins. Then, why is this disparity and hatred towards one person to another
To ones conscience, if someone is practising his or her religion he or she should love the fellow beings. It is not just worshipping, going to the holy places and strict towards their religious rules, indeed, which are absurd and shame for the religion one practices. According to all the religions, killing is prohibited and a sin. Inadvertently, it brings animosity to the entire nation.
Significantly, the recent incident, the burning news, which had taken place in Digana, Teldeniya, was the cold-blooded massacre. Beyond that, it made everyones heart pounding whether it is going to be an outbreak of ethnic riot. Further, once the precious life is taken, that cannot be brought back. Regrettably, only the affected family has to bear the whole loss and the pain forever. Even the public and the social the media, will not bother on a long run. That is the nature.
Human life is precious more than anything else in the world. So everyone should respect, value and treat with humanitarianism. Be that as it may, there are many ways to negotiate and settle any problem instead of punishing or revenging anyone by killing.
Once the system is collapsed, it is a strenuous job to put the disturbed equilibrium right. If everyone realizes that we are Sri Lankans, most of the problems will be solved. Undoubtedly, we are all brothers and sisters of this nation. So it is a duty and responsibility of every citizen to let the country remain in peace and harmony for marching to the thriving development. Harmony makes small things grow, lack of it makes great things decay.

## Title: CKD: Preventing irreversible damage to kidneys
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

CKD: Preventing irreversible damage to kidneys
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a gradual loss of kidney function over a period of months or years. Damage to kidney tissue in CKD is irreversible and progressive even if the cause is eliminated. Causes may vary and typically there are no symptoms in early disease. Symptoms usually appear when more than 70 percent of the kidney functions have been lost. Therefore, waiting until symptoms appear is not the right approach in CKD. It is roughly estimated that there are more than 60,000 CKD patients in Sri Lanka, out of which 5,000 are in advanced stages.
Kidneys have multiple functions which are essential for life. They regulate blood volume by controlling urine production. Excretion of waste products and foreign substances from the body is done by the kidneys. Blood pressure, ionic composition of blood, and blood acidbase regulations are also controlled by the kidneys. Red blood cell production and Vitamin D synthesis are supported.
In chronic kidney disease all of the above functions get impaired. This will lead to variable symptoms experienced by patients. There could be swelling due to failure of water excretion. Commonly, the face and ankles swell up. In addition to the visible swelling, internal organs are also affected. This results in shortness of breath due to wet lungs.
High blood pressure is a feature of kidney failure as regulation by the kidney is lost. Key ions in the body, including potassium, sodium and chloride, are basically controlled and even a mild alteration of these will create an unfavourable environment for the body. High potassium levels can cause heart rhythm disturbances and muscle weakness, while low sodium is associated with confusion, and low calcium levels cause muscle weakness. Maintaining the bodys acidbase balance is essential to maintain cell functions optimally. The hormone erythropoietin, which is synthesised by kidney cells, stimulates bone marrow to produce red cells to maintain haemoglobin. Lack of this hormone results in anaemia. A key step in Vitamin D synthesis happens in the kidney and patients suffering from kidney failure will have Vitamin D deficiency.
A wide range of factors can damage kidneys gradually to cause CKD. Some agents can damage to blood vessels, some can damage the supporting tissues of kidney cells, and some can directly damage kidney cells. Pathways of damaging kidney cells may vary depending on the aetiology, but the end result is death of kidney cells and scarring. This is the reason why damaged kidneys cannot be regenerated.
Diabetes is the Number One cause of chronic kidney disease anywhere in the world. When the prevalence of diabetes goes up in a region, the number of CKD patients also goes up. Elevated blood sugar levels damage the small blood vessels in the body. This affects many organs including the kidneys, eye and nervous system. The initial feature is mild protein leak in urine, which can only be detected by special urine tests and can be missed in routine tests. This is called the micro-albuminaemic stage of diabetic kidney disease. Then it progresses to the high leaking stage and it is readily detected by simple urine tests. At this stage, patients observe that their urine is frothier than earlier. Following this stage, the kidney functions start to deteriorate gradually with obvious biochemical markers of kidney damage. Poorly controlled blood sugar levels will expedite the damage and, in patients with high blood pressure, will cause faster deterioration. Kidney damage in diabetes patients will be enhanced by recurrent infections anywhere in the body, certain antibiotics used for them, and painkillers.
Chronic kidney disease in children will impair their growth. CKD patients will experience the following problems: excessive water in the body causing swelling and shortness of breath, confusion and weakness due to accumulation of toxic substances in the body, heart rhythm disturbances due to salt imbalances, uncontrollable high blood pressure, anaemia due to erythropoietin deficiency, and skeletal problems due to low Vitamin D and calcium levels. Further, CKD patients will commonly experience loss of appetite, lack of sleep, body aches and pains, darkening of skin and itching caused by accumulation of various metabolic waste products in excessive amounts due to lack of filtration into the urine.
Treatment of CKD involves correction of these abnormalities. Calcium and Vitamin D can be supplemented and blood acidity can be neutralised by drugs. Erythropoietin can be given in the form of injections to improve the haemoglobin. Lack of sleep, itching and appetite can be helped with certain medicines.
Swollen ankles are a symptom of CKD.
But, these symptoms and problems cannot completely be treated by medicines. The only way is to get the functions of the kidneys done by some other way such as by transplanting a new kidney. Kidney transplant will normalise most of the ill effects caused by CKD and will reverse most of the negative effects of CKD patients. But, dialysis will do some of the tasks of the kidneys, such as cleaning of toxins from the blood and removal of excess water from the body. Dialysis is a basic treatment where the toxins are removed mechanically from the body. Two types of dialysis is available, i.e., haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. In the former, a patients blood is cleaned by a machine twice or thrice a week at a dialysis centre. Each session is of three to four hours duration. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) in contrast, is done at home and is a continuous process. The best treatment for CKD is a kidney transplant which will give patients more freedom to lead a normal life.
Diagnosis of CKD is not always straightforward. In high-risk patients, screening will help early diagnosis which in turn will help to improve the outcomes. Main tools for diagnosing CKD include urine tests and blood biochemistry for creatinine, urea and potassium levels. Imaging of kidneys by ultrasound scanning might show altered kidney tissues and sometimes, small shrunken kidneys. Complications of CKD are detected by many other directed urinary, biochemical and radiological investigations. End-stage kidney disease is irreversible and complete impairment of kidney function, which needs kidney replacement to maintain life. Scientifically, we can calculate the existing amount of kidney functions; when it is less than 10, we can call it end-stage kidney disease (normal is 80120).
There are few golden rules for preventing CKD and end-stage kidney disease. These include proper control of diabetes and high blood pressure. Awareness and regular screening of high-risk groups for CKD is a must. High-risk groups include all diabetics, hypertensive people who live in areas where kidney disease is endemic, those who have positive family history of CKD, and people with any other kidney disease such as kidney stones.
To maintain the health of the kidneys in general, we should consume enough pure water, treat blood sugar and high blood pressure properly, avoid high salt content in diet, avoid over-the-counter medication, avoid smoking, maintain a healthy weight, and have an active lifestyle with regular physical exercise.
This years theme for World Kidney Day is Kidneys and womens health. There are a few conditions which specifically affect womens kidneys. These include complications in pregnancy and autoimmune type of kidney diseases. Kidney infections are more frequent in females than in males. CKD reduces the fertility of women and also results in poor foetal and maternal outcomes in pregnancy. Certain complications of pregnancy can lead to CKD and timely diagnosing and management of these complications can prevent permanent damage. Public awareness, prevention, early detection, and timely treatment are the factors that promote the health of kidneys in the case of women.

The IT industry of Sri Lanka today is famous for producing world-class leaders, entrepreneurs and products. This success comes due to professionals and many who work tirelessly regardless of race, religion and ethnicity. We are successful because each of us from varying backgrounds works together as one team. By embracing diversity, we can proudly say that Sri Lanka is a diverse land of innovation and ingenuity.
As such, in these turbulent times, we as IT professionals must play our part. Confront any incidents of racial or religious discrimination immediately. Speak about the importance of diversity among our fellow colleagues, he said.

Dealing with the aftermath
The firm resolve demonstrated by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to go after the culprits of the recent incidents in Kandy has to be commended. In the past, the perpetrators of similar incidents were allowed to go unpunished after the initial hot air let out by the authorities, with the result that the unruly elements were emboldened to repeat their mayhem, in more virulent forms. The Aluthgama incidents spring to mind where the arsonists went scot-free, with the government of the day not taking any concrete action to punish the culprits.
Speaking at a special meeting convened at the Kandy Kachcheri on Saturday in the aftermath of the mayhem, Premier Wickremesinghe said incidents of this nature would not recur if only punishment was meted out to the wrongdoers. If this was not done there would be a repetition of such incidents. As such, the law will be strictly implemented against the wrongdoers irrespective of their status or position. He said the investigations would not be confined to the appointment of a Commission. The Government would go ahead with its duties and responsibilities without waiting until the Commission announced its decision, he said.
The determination of the Premier to get to the bottom of the incidents, no doubt, is bound to act as an impetus to the law enforcement to hunt down the perpetrators without let or hindrance. The practice hitherto had been for the police to let things die off after the initial noise, following incidents of this nature. The victims were made to suffer in silence after their hopes were raised. It is in this context that the Premier's statement that all victims of the Kandy and Ampara violence would be adequately compensated would no doubt be a great solace to those who were at the receiving end. The PM has already ordered that the loan installments of the victims be suspended which would also be a big relief to them after what they have already been through.
It is not only financial assistance and other compensation to rebuild their lives alone that matters. They should also be helped in lifting their spirits after the harrowing ordeal they were subjected to. Religious leaders could be of immense help in this respect. It is also gratifying to note how the Maha Sangha acted in this respect in the aftermath of the incidents. Contrary to the hate mongering which we have come to associate with certain hardline Buddhist clergy at such times what was witnessed was a collective rallying call by all members of the Sangha to their followers to go to the assistance of the victims. Some members of the Sangha even went to the extent of providing protection to mosques in Kandy during the Friday prayers, a gesture no doubt would have gone a long away in rekindling the spirit of brotherhood and amity among both communities. The move made by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to meet the leaders of all political party leaders together with religious leaders too would send the right message to all that all parties were united in restoring goodwill and harmony between the communities and that the misdeeds of a few should not stand in the way of fostering good relations.
Be that as it may, all measures should be taken by the government to ensure no repetition of the type of incidents that were witnessed in Kandy and Ampara. The police should be issued with strict instructions to move in immediately at the first sign of trouble and deal severely with the agent provocateurs. The move by Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena to set up District Security Committees to handle such situations too is a step in the right direction. According to the Minister, all Divisional Secretaries will be given instructions by District Secretaries led by the district security committees on planning and coordinating on the manner of dealing with emergencies, serious crime and other occurrences which are likely to endanger peace and tranquility in the district.
One of the key elements that was lacking in foreseeing the Kandy incidents was said to be intelligence and the police was squarely blamed for this lapse. Hence it is vital that attention be paid towards this important aspect. According to Colombo District MP Mujibur Rahman the main suspect now in custody had been sowing the seeds of communal hatred for the last two years and yet no attention was paid to his (MP's) complaints by the authorities. Had the conduct of this individual been brought under close scrutiny prior to this, the damage could have been contained to a greater degree, was his lament.
It is time that some genuine soul searching be done by the concerned authorities in coming to grips with dealing with communal tensions that would have gone below the surface for the time being but is likely emerge from time to time, as has been the experience in the recent past. Politicians of all hues should exercise caution without giving vent to their emotions that could incite extremist elements into violent action. Above all, they should unite, shedding political differences, in bringing together all communities in peaceful co-existence.

Death traps at Dambulla central bus stand
The Dambulla central bus stand maintained by the Dambulla Municipal Council is in a neglected state, posing danger to commuters visiting it and vehicles parking there.
The iron sheets covering the drains inside the bus stand premises have broken and the sharp protruding edges pose a veritable death trap to commuters visiting the bus stand in haste to board buses.
Bus crews also allege that tyres of their buses entering the bus stand often get punctured by getting caught in the broken edges of iron sheets covering drains. Although the Municipal Council charge a daily fee of Rs. 50 from each bus entering the bus stand, it had miserably failed to maintain the utility in a proper manner by promptly attending to repair work.
Moreover, the stench emanating from the clogged drains was unbearable, most commuters said. Municipal Commissioner Ruwan Ratnayake, when contacted, said urgent action would be taken to renovate the bus stand and resolve the problem for the convenience of commuters and bus crew.

Dunkirk : Ever-intensifying combat thriller
Christopher Nolan, better known for directing the Dark Knight trilogy, Inception and Interstellar has proved he is as capable as other new world directors of handling a new genre. What makes his latest movie Dunkirk so unique is how Nolan narrates the story in an innovative way to keep the vibe going.
Nolan depicts the famous World War II battle in which four hundred thousand stranded allied troopers miraculously escape the Nazi Germans by crossing the English Channel from Dunkirk on hundreds of ships, vessels, small boats and many civilian vessels. This is marked as a miraculous evacuation in history, leaving many question marks to the world in real life which the film twists with lot of perspectives.
Nolans timeline
The structure of the film has three concurrent timelines which are all laid out in the first opening minutes. The Mole: showing the soldiers trying to get off the beach which takes place over the course of one week, The Sea: showing British civilians piloting a yacht to rescue those soldiers which take place over the course of one day and The Air: showing two spitfire pilots as they get into dog fights with German pilots over the channel, that take place over the course of one hour.
Just to clarify things the scenes with Tommy, Gibson and the commanders (Kenneth Branagh) lasts a whole week. The scenes with Dawson (Mark Rylance), Peter and George take place on the final day of that week and the scenes with Ferrier (Tom Hardy) and Collins take place on the final hour of that final day with all three of these timelines converging in one climactic scene. Like he did with Inception and Interstellar, Christopher Nolan is telling this story with a nonlinear timeline who some say is a gimmick. How Nolans timeline creates an honest war film, in my opinion, is actually one of the reasons this movie is a triumph.
Race against time
This storytelling decision affects each of the aspects of the film and its characters. A reason why Nolan does this is to share the focus among several characters in different parts of the battle. In real wars people in different parts of a battle perceive the passage of time differently. The soldiers on the beach probably felt time slowly ticking away over those several days with the enemy gradually closing in and no rescue in sight. Meanwhile the civilians on both crossings of the channel might have measured time in daylight as the sun moved across the sky to mark the time of the day. The pilots in the air with limited fuel measured time in minutes of an hour which we see Ferrier do throughout the runtime.
This way we get to see all these characters as no one takes the spotlight as the hero. In true victory, survival is a team effort. So in Dunkirk several characters are heroic in different ways while others may be less than heroic. Interestingly, two of the biggest stars of the movie are Harry Styles as the British Soldier Alex and Cillian Murphy as the unnamed shivering soldier. Although Chris Nolan makes it clear these characters arent villains despite the shivering soldier being a deserter who is called a coward, another character defends him saying he is just shell-shocked. He says that he is not himself and he may never be so again.
The villain of this movie is another product of Nolans timeline and it shows that the Germans arent the villains. The real villain of the movie is time. We never really see the Germans in this movie. They are depicted as out of focus figures in the background or sounds of gunfire in the distance or tiny dots in the sky. It also illustrates the inevitable deaths that these soldiers have no chance to defeat outright in this battle. Instead all the characters are racing against time, holding off the Nazi Germans just long enough so that they can escape and live to fight another day.
Conclusion
107 minutes being the runtime of this movie, is comparatively a short one from Nolan. Most of Nolans movies had been well over two hours and Dunkirk slows down, breaking up the air battle among the timelines making the movie a one big exciting action sequence like Mad Max Fury Road.
I always get hyped for Nolan exploring new waves and new orders to tell a story, no matter what the genre is. He made one of the best superhero movies ever with The Dark Knight and one of the best heist movies ever with Inception and now with one of the best war films ever Dunkirk to his name Nolan has once again proven his mettle as a director. Dunkirk creates a structure that allowed him to explore several different perceptions of the chronology of one famous event thus depicting the battle of Dunkirk with the honesty it deserves and needs now.

The Australian High Commissioner in Colombo, Bryce Hutchesson, yesterday said that it was high time to lift the ban on social media in the country.
Time, overdue, to lift Sri Lankas blanket blocking of key social media platforms - a blunt instrument, Hutchesson tweeted yesterday. US Ambassador Atul Keshap had also raised concerns over the ban on certain social media platforms.
Social media is an imperfect, evolving and fluid platform that uses new technology to connect and reflect human societies as whole, including the good and bad. Hate-filled people who exploit news ways to fan the flames of intolerance and violence are the real main culprits, Keshap tweeted

EU will stand up to trade bullies
The EUs trade commissioner has said the bloc will stand up to the bullies over protectionism as tensions continue over US tariffs on imported steel and aluminium imposed by President Trump.
Cecilia Malmstrm was speaking at a conference in Brussels, following discussions at the weekend with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.
Those talks are to resume this week.
Malmstrm said protectionism was being used as a weapon to threaten and intimidate us.
The EU says that its exports should be excluded from the measures.
Trumps announcement of import tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium has sparked fears of a trade war. He signed the measures on Thursday last week in a ceremony at the White House attended by steel and aluminium workers.
In some places, trade has been to blame for the pains of globalisation or they used it as a scapegoat or they think we can live behind walls and borders, Malmstrm said, without specifically mentioning the US. Recently we have seen how it is used as a weapon to threaten and intimidate us. But we are not afraid, we will stand up to the bullies. The EU has threatened retaliatory tariffs on US goods, including iconic products such as bourbon and blue jeans.
Canada and Mexico will be exempt from the tariffs initially, and Australia is optimistic that it too will gain exemption.
Trump has linked this to a new security agreement between the US and Australia, which already have close military ties. UK Steel says 7% of its steel exports go to the US, worth 360m. There has been strong opposition to the tariffs from Trumps fellow Republicans, who traditionally favour free trade.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that no one will win a race to the bottom and said the tariffs risked hurting everyone.BBC News

Federer takes care of business, Djokovic crashes out
Indian Wells, Monday: World number one Roger Federer finished off Federico Delbonis in a rain-disrupted match on Sunday to reach the third round at Indian Wells as five-time champion Novak Djokovic was toppled.
Federer returned to stadium court on Sunday afternoon and needed an hour to close out his second-round victory 6-3, 7-6 (8/6).
"It's been a long time since I have been interrupted at night and have to come back the next day," Federer said.
His title defence got off to a soggy start Saturday night when play was suspended because of rain showers with Federer up a set and tied 2-2 in the second.
The clouds rolled in just before the start of their match on Saturday and after a short delay to start the first set they managed to play until the skies blackened and the heavy rains came in the second. After another 90-minute delay organizers suspended play for the night.
Federer is making his 17th appearance in the California desert and is assured of remaining world number one if he makes it to the semi-finals. He extended his 2018 win streak to 13 matches and has only dropped three sets from 34 played this year.
Federer hit five aces and won 74 percent of his first serve points in the match which took a total of one hour and 41 minutes over the two days.
He will face 25th-seed Filip Krajinovic in the third round.
Federer and 10th seed Djokovic both came into the tournament seeking to become the first six-time winner of the event.
But Djokovic fell at the first hurdle with a shock loss to Japanese qualifier Taro Daniel, who sent the out-of-sorts Serb tumbling with a hard-fought 7-6 (7/3), 4-6, 6-1 victory. AFP

Fiji tops Kenya to win Vancouver Sevens
LOS ANGELES: Fiji exploded for 19 unanswered points in the second half to race away to a 31-12 victory over Kenya Sunday in the final of the World Rugby Sevens Series in Vancouver, Canada.
Fiji became the first team to notch two tournament titles this season, leapfrogging New Zealand to move from third to second in the series standings behind South Africa.
The Blitzboks, who beat the United States 29-7 in the bronze medal game, maintained their lead on 109 points, with Fiji just eight back at 101 and New Zealand third on 92.
Im speechless, really proud of the boys, Fiji captain Jerry Tuwai said. The win here in Vancouver gives us something to fight for in the series table. All the teams now are very hard to play against, not like before. Sevuloni Mocenacagi scored two tries, the second of which launched Fijis second-half surge.
Alasio Naduva and Paula Dranisinukula also scored after the break.
Quickfire tries from each side made it 7-7 two minutes in, Willy Ambaka crossing first for Kenya, only to see Fiji respond immediately with a try from Josua Vakurunabili.
Samuel Oliech swept over to put Kenya back in front. The conversion attempt was short and a Kenyan mistake on the restart was a golden opportunity for Fiji, with Mocenacagi racing over for a try that made it 12-12 at halftime.
Fiji had it well in hand when Ambaka went flying down the left wing apparently set to give Kenya a final try only for Tuwai to wrap him up.
Fiji had edged South Africa 15-12 in the semi-finals courtesy of second-half tries from Kalione Nasoko and Amenoni Nasilasila.
Kenya ended US hopes of building on their victory last weekend in Las Vegas with a dramatic 24-19 semi-final victory over the Eagles.
Kenya had reached the semis with a 12-0 quarter-final win over England, their first over that side since 2011.
In other quarter-finals, the United States shut out New Zealand 17-0 in a match that saw no score until the second half and South Africa staged a second-half fightback to beat Australia 24-19.
The Aussies racked up two tries in the first four minutes and a third converted try by John Porch saw them lead 19-0 at the break.
South Africa responded with two tries from Siviwe Soyizwapi and tries from Cecil Afrika and Dylan Sage -- Sage scoring well after the siren to extinguish Australian hopes.
Fiji signalled their intentions for the day with a 43-7 quarter-final thrashing of Argentina.
The series now heads to Hong Kong for the seventh round April 6-8. AFP

Hi-tech ballistic image analyser to help crime scene investigations
The Government Analyst's Department plans to purchase an automated ballistic image analyser which will help speed up the hearing of firearm-related criminal cases, said Government Analyst's Department Director General A Welianga.
The automated ballistic image analyser is the most modern automatic microscope available in the world, he said. It can provide scientific data about firearms and spent cartridges found at a crime scene. It also simplifies the process of maintaining a computerised data bank of such findings.
He said the department recently purchased a modern analyser which helps to identify the cause of a fire and ascertain if it was due to natural causes or was an act of arson.

Hip, hip hooray for sports mainstay the humble bolay!
In many sports the balls the thing! Nothing could be achieved without it. As a spectator youve got to keep your eye on it all the time. And as a player youve got to be on the ball if you intend making an impact on the play.
In team sports in particular if a player fumbles or drops it could mean a balls up for the entire squad. Meaning it could change the whole complexion of the game and could be the difference between a win or a defeat.
But paradoxically the spherical object used in many such sports, which is the cynosure of all eyes, is the most underrated entity on the field. The ball is the core and quintessential element of so many games that makes you realise how inadequate is the honour that history has paid to it.
The unsung, un-honoured, innocent orb, simply, makes sports whole world go round. The wheel is considered to be mans greatest invention. With the wheel came movement. I will argue however that the humble ball is actually mans greatest invention.
The ball is one of the worlds most emotionally satisfying objects and the most sustainable. Only balls with holes in them, unable to be inflated ever again, are tossed into landfills. Ever wonder why we love the ball so much The ball is our childhood friend. And many of us learn to cherish it even in adulthood. That is why you see so many grown men kicking, chasing or clobbering a spherical object as if their lives depended on it.
As children we learn to discover the world using our instincts and impulses. The ball is round and round is a signal that something is touchable, safe, not dangerous. The ball is non-threatening. The ball is safe to hold and its behaviour is predictable. If you throw it, bounce it or kick it, a perfectly round ball will move in its intended direction  up, down, in a direct line.
The curved roundness of a ball signalled comfort to us when we were children, an insight based on maternal familiarity and a preference that is also seen in our childhood love for round characters such as Barney or the Teletubbies who are bound to fuel an obesity epidemic.
Without the ball, I propose that the wheel could not have been invented. Not because I think the roundness of the ball inspired the wheel, but because without the ball what would man have bounced against the wall while he was thinking about the wheel The ball surely predated the wheel because mans most important need, outside of food of course, is for play. Without adventuresome play, new lands would not have been conquered. And without play, the human race would have surely died out.
Yes the ball is everywhere. Even our little universe is said to be an orbiting ball. Take the Sinhala alphabet for instance whose letters are curlicues or whorls, round shapes all curved without sharp angles and shaped like balls which in local parlance is bola. Or to put it in plain English, its simply balls all the way!
Over the years pundits have coined more sophisticated terms for it, such as pandu. Now pandu, is a common expression used mostly by Sinhala cricket commentators to describe the bright red cherry that is used in the game.
It is also used as a fairly innovative idiomatic expression by Sri Lankans who often refer to someone playing the merry devil or messing around as playing pandu.
Again another Sri Lankan colloquialism that goes, bola bassanava refers to someone trying to pull the wool over ones eyes. Still in everyday conversational usage the word bola is used extensively. You hardly hear a fielder asking a passerby to fetch the panduwa when it has been hit for a six and is lying on the grass verge outside the playground.
The word bolay in the Sinhala lexicon must have been derived from the Portuguese word bola which happens to be the same in Spanish. Of course you must have heard of the South American throwing weapon bolas made of circular weights on the ends of interconnected cords designed to capture cattle or game by entangling their legs.
There is no game in which players lose their balls more than in golf. Statistics reveal that roughly 28 million golfers lose roughly 300 million balls  thats just under a dozen (or a box) of balls per golfer per year. That is why some wag quipped that golf balls are like eggs. They're white, they are sold by the dozen, and a week later you have to buy more.
Yet for sheer variety, colour and spectacle nothing can beat a set of snooker balls which come in a variety of hues. The hard spherical objects come in a kaleidoscope of colours and a white cue ball. Point values for object balls: red-1, yellow-2, green-3, brown-4, blue-5, pink-6, black-7.
Ok we have balls in all colours and sizes for various sports. And dearie me, I almost forgot the most humble game of all which belonged to a bygone era of innocence, gentility and safety with the smallest balls of them all. Ahhh, marbles or attabola as they are called in local jargon, how we loved them.
We were mesmerised by them when we were little uns. There was something very comforting about rolling those cool, smooth, colourful glass orbs between your fingers. Even the tiniest lisping marbles buffs described it all too aptly when they simply stated: Marbellous.
The ball, of course, is fundamental to manifold aspects of cricket: seam, shine, inswing, outswing, reverse swing, new ball, old ball, out-of-shape ball, no-ball and lost ball. Cricket balls in recent times were coloured red until the cowboy versions of the game came up with a white orb for better clarity during day-night games. Now many are seeing red over the emergence of the pink ball while others seem tickled pink over the whole controversial issue.
But really, when is a ball not a ball I guess that the oddball that stands out is the one they play rugby with as opposed to the round soccer ball. Some say soccer is a gentlemens game played by thugs and rugby is a thugs game played by gentlemen. Whatever the merits or demerits of either game one must concede that rugby is a sport played by men with odd shaped balls.
Soccer aficionados teasingly say that rugby is a game for the mentally deficient. That is why, they conclude, it was invented by the Pommies. Who else but a Brit could invent an oval ball

Indias economy is recovering from the disruptions caused by GST, demonetisation, says IMF
The Indian economy is on its way to recovering from the temporary disruptions caused by demonetisation and the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax, a senior official of the International Monetary Fund said on Saturday.
IMF Deputy Managing Director Tao Zhang told PTI in an interview that the 7.2% Gross Domestic Product growth registered in the October-December quarter of 2017-18 had regained India the title of the worlds fastest-growing major economy.
As cash transactions dominated Indias economic activity, Zhang noted that it was inevitable that demonetisation would affect growth, albeit temporarily. Although he called the implementation of GST a landmark accomplishment, he highlighted how the complexities and glitches in the system made it far from perfect.
The top official of the IMF will be in India and Bhutan from March 12 to March 20.
Zhang also highlighted how the Indian economy needed reforms in the health and education sectors, improvements in banking efficiency and encouragement of private and public investment. This would support durable and inclusive growth and enable India to move toward the income levels of wealthier countries, he told the news agency.
In December, too, the IMF had said that demonetisation had caused temporary disruptions in Indias economy  primarily affecting private consumption and small businesses  but those effects were gradually disappearing.

India make strong comeback to beat Sri Lanka
India came back strongly to stay in contention for a place in the final of the Hero Nidahas trophy T20 tri-series when they defeated Sri Lanka by six wickets in the return match played at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
Beaten in the first match by five wickets India played better cricket than Sri Lanka to come up with a win where the credit should go to their bowling unit for keeping Sri Lanka pinned down to a score of 152-9 in a contest reduced to 19 overs a side after persistent rain had delayed the start by 80 minutes.

Sri Lankas middle and lower order batting was undone by Mumbai Indians 26-year-old right-arm medium-pacer Shardul Thakur who took a career best four wickets for 27 runs to carry away the Man of the Match award. Only the other day in the first game against Sri Lanka, Thakur was taken to the cleaners for 27 runs in an over by Kusal Perera  what a great leveller this game of cricket is.
After a stutter when they lost four wickets 85 runs India were seen home and dry in the 18th over by their fifth wicket pair Manish Pandey and Dinesh Karthik who steered them to victory with an unbroken partnership of 68 off 46 balls for the fifth wicket.
Pandey finished on 42 not out scored off 31 balls with one six and three fours and Karthik had five fours in his unbeaten 39 that came off 25 balls.
Sri Lanka playing an additional bowler vice-captain Suranga Lakmal for suspended skipper Dinesh Chandimal just did not have enough firepower in their line-up going with only four specialist batters. Their total was always going to be insufficient to test the Indian batting that had the experience of virtually all the players carrying the experience of playing in the IPL.
India knew exactly how to get about overhauling the not too imposing target picking the singles and twos and hitting the odd boundary that carried them towards their target without taking any undue risks.
Sri Lankas only bright spark was the magnificent knock of 55 off 38 balls by Kusal Mendis  his fourth fifty in five innings that comprised three sixes and three fours.
Mendis and Upul Tharanga (22) carried Sri Lanka to a strong position of 96-2 figuring in a third wicket partnership of 62 off 46 balls before the Indian spinners and Thakur came into play.
After spinner Washington Sundar had removed Tharanga for 22, the rest of the innings fell apart with hardly any worthwhile contribution coming from the rest of the batters as Sri Lanka lost six wickets for 38 runs in the final seven overs. In the defeat against Bangladesh it was the Lankan bowlers who were badly exposed on a flat track and yesterday it was their batting that failed to put up a total that would have challenged Indias batting.
The defeat was Sri Lankas second in successive matches having lost to Bangladesh in the first leg on Saturday and it puts them under pressure to win their return match against Bangladesh on Friday if they are to qualify for the final.
India play Bangladesh on Wednesday in their final round robin match and will qualify for the final if they win, which would leave the winners of the last round robin match between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh to decide on the other finalist.

Kandy incidents adversely affected tourism - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Sunday said the incidents in Kandy had an adverse impact on the tourism industry.
Adding that Kandy witnesses the highest number of tourist arrivals after Colombo, the Prime Minister said; A large number of Arab nationals, who come to the island as tourists, visit Kandy too. Many who depend on tourism for a living urged me to restore normalcy in Kandy as soon as possible, the Prime Minister said.
The Premier also thanked all those who contributed in containing the violence from spreading to other areas of the country.
Participating in a ceremony to lay the foundation stone for a new monastery at the Sedawatte Weheragoda Punrana Viharaya in Wellampitiya on Sunday, the Prime Minister said; Many feared the wave of racial tensions which started in Kandy might spread to other areas of the country.
We too had the same doubt, but we were successful in bringing the situation under control, he said.
I thank all stakeholders, including the Security Forces and Police personnel and the Maha Sanga for their contributions in this regard.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, pledging to expedite legal action against those responsible for triggering the violence, observed that the destructive acts of a few people have brought disrepute and a black mark on the Sinhala people.
We were in the international spotlight due to similar incidents in the past.Such incidents affect the Buddhist community in the whole of South Asia.
People in Middle Eastern countries inquired from me as to what was happening here. News of the violence created by a few destrctive elements had spread like wild fire throughout the world, the Prime Minister said.
We fought against each other for 30 years as a result of a terrorist war. As a result, peace and harmony in the country was damaged and unity between the various communities was dented.We are still in the process of restoring that unity,the Prime Minister said.
First of all, we need to forge a one Sri Lankan identity. The issues between Muslim and Sinhala communities must be resolved through negotiations without resorting to violence. It is the future of Sri Lanka that is at stake when people resort to hatred and violence. We saw how terrorism affected the future of our youth.Can we allow the same thing to happen againthe Premier questioned pointing out that it is high time to find a final solution to the ethnic problem.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe stressed that even though the use of social media is not an issue to the Government, spreading extremism and violence throught it is a serious problem. People voted us to power in 2015 expecting a change. Even though we cannot usher in a complete change, I request all to resolve the existing problems through dialogue and negotiation while preserving law and order, he concluded.

Katmandu plane crash: 49 dead

At least 49 people were killed when a plane approached the runway from the wrong direction, crashed and burst into flames while landing at Kathmandu's Tribhuvan Airport in Nepal on Monday.
Flight BS 211, which belongs to US-Bangla Airlines, a privately owned Bangladeshi carrier, was flying from Dhaka, Bangladesh, police spokesperson Manoj Neupane said.
There were 71 passengers on the plane, including the crew, said Kamrul Islam, the head of public relations for US-Bangla.
Forty bodies were recovered at the scene, nine died in hospital and 22 survivors are receiving treatment in hospital after the crash at 2:15 p.m. local time, Neupane said.
The passengers were mainly Nepalese and Bangladeshi with one from China and one from the Maldives, Tribhuvan Airport general manager Raj Kumar Chhetri told CNN. All four crew members were from Bangladesh, officials said.
The plane approached the runway from the wrong direction, according to Chhetri.
"The plane had permission to land from the southern side of the runway but they instead landed from the northern side. Authorities do not know why they did not land from the southern side," Chhetri said.
The aircraft's two recorders the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder have both been recovered.
Nepal's recently elected Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli visited the crash site to take stock of the situation.
Witness: Plane was 'much too low'
Amanda Summers, a retired American living in Kathmandu, told CNN she saw the crash of flight BS 211 from her rooftop overlooking the airport.
"I was on my rooftop that overlooks Kathmandu from the top of the valley -- I spend most of my time there -- when I saw the plane flying at very low altitude," she told.
"It was flying northwards and it was much too low. I thought at first that maybe it was extra cloud cover that was forcing the plane to fly low. Then I saw the plane change direction almost completely and it was flying straight towards us. Then it lost more altitude and finally crashed.
"I saw one spark, or flash. Then seconds later I saw another bigger one. It was almost as if the plane might have bounced. Then no more light but a tall billow of thick black smoke rose in the air," she added.
"We had done boarding, waiting to take off and then a 70-seater ATR plane was approaching to land and everyone in our plane started to look towards it. And then 30 second later there was smoke," traveler Shradha Giri, who was at the airport waiting for a domestic flight, told CNN.
ATR is a Franco-Italian aviation company known for its turboprop planes.
According to Flightradar24, the plane was a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400, which the company describes as "the world's most modern turboprop."

My secretary stood at my office door a grin on her pretty face, The Punjab paper editor just said hell send your cheque tomorrow! Arent you happy
I looked at her eager face and felt sad to disappoint her, He wont! I said.
He told me hell personally post it! she whispered tearfully, He sounded convincing!
Weve become good at it! I said sadly, Tomorrow when you call him, hell say he just posted it, after that hell blame the postal system for the delay and a year later well continue staring at an empty bank balance!
I watched the poor girl walk out of my office, crestfallen. But thats what weve all become, convincing liars! And no, it isnt only about payments, Hi Bob! my friend calls out, How are you placed this weekend
The same way I was placed last weekend, and the weekend before, and even the weekend before that! I say with a cynical smile, which seems lost on him, as he continues, Then lets go out for drinks and dinner together!
Same place, same time I ask.
What he asks slightly confused.
Do we meet at the same place and time, as we met last week and the week before and the week before that And order the same drinks or shall I change mine to something stronger, like Tequila shots He suddenly understands and grins sheepishly, Look Im sorry, something came up last week!
And the week before! I say, as he looks down guiltily.
So tomorrow what time I ask purposely.
Ill call you! he says, and suddenly I look him in the eye, Why, let me call you! I say, round six okay with you
He nods, but I know when I call at six and seven and eight, his phone will either be switched off or wont be answered.
Weve become a people of words! It makes us feel good to call someone over for dinner, without that dinner ever happening, to offer help without any help ever materializing, to say well send a payment the next day, without any such money leaving our pockets, our banks, or maybe even our minds! But words are offered, promises made, and the giver of those meaningless, useless utterances feels good as he strides away or puts the phone down.
Hes fooled someone again!
My mind goes back to three years ago; I hear a voice on TV, I promise you fifteen lakhs in your bank account! I promise you progress, and minimum government, maximum governance!
I hear a voice in America, I promise you jobs, jobs, jobs!
I see people voting for the same promisers and then look up as my secretary pops her head in, Will you be writing for that newspaper sir
Yes, I tell her sadly, Here we live by hope, that maybe, maybe somebody will keep a dinner date..!

Alleged Extortion case filed against Prasanna Ranatunga
Key witness claims he was threatened
Businessman Gehard Mendis, 74, a key witness in the alleged extortion case filed against three accused including Gampaha District Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife yesterday informed Colombo High Court that Prasanna Ranatunga while he was serving as the Western Province Chief Minister in 2015 had threatened him over the phone demanding the rest of the money involved in a land deal.
The Attorney General (AG) had filed indictments against former Western Province Chief Minister Prasanna Ranatunga, his wife Maureen Ranatunga and another person on the charge of threatening a businessman demanding the rest of money out of Rs.64 m.
When the case came up before Colombo Chief High Court Judge Lalith Ekanayake, the witness said Prasanna Ranatunga gave him a telephone call demanding him to pay the rest of the money involved in a land located in the Meetotamulla area.
The witness said he purchased a 2.2 acre land in Meethotamulla and he sought former Chief Ministers assistance to evacuate the unlawful occupants of that land and fill it with soil.
He further said the former Chief Minister, his wife along with two others had entered into an agreement with him and later Prasanna Ranatunga demanded from him Rs.64 million. He further said taking into consideration the influence exerted by first accused, a politician, he took measures to issue 11 cheques in order ensure his familys security. He said he had paid Rs.15 million to the accused party but several cheques were dishonored due to insufficient funds in his bank account.
Prosecution evidence was led by Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige and Senior State Counsel Shavindra Wickrema.
Presidents Counsel Anil Silva with counsel Mary Dickmon appeared for the accused.
Further trial was fixed for March 15.
On a previous occasion, the Colombo High Court decided to proceed the trial against Gampaha District Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife in absentia of third accused Naresh Kumar Fareek who was evading courts from the beginning of investigations.
MP Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife are currently out on bail.
The Attorney General filed indictments on 15 counts against three accused Prasanna Ranatunga, Maureen Ranatunga and Naresh Kumar Fareek based on charges of committing offences during the period between April 6, 2015 and June 2, 2015.
In addition, the AG has named 65 witnesses and included 35 articles as Court productions against the three accused in this case.

Lankan women in IT commit to advance diversity and inclusion in workplace
In a bid to bring gender diversity to the forefront, a group of high-profile professionals from some of Sri Lanka's leading technology-driven companies have committed time, effort, and energy towards a series of programmes under Driving Gender Diversity and Inclusion in the Workplace.
The working group, Diversity Collective, is committed to the advancement of diversity and inclusion in the workplace, and promoting the future of young and aspiring female IT students. Diversity Collective comprises employees from London Stock Exchange Group, MillenniumIT, WSO2, Virtusa, and Fortitude.
Initiated by the Asian Development Bank together with the Export Development Bank of Sri Lanka as the nodal agency, Diversity Collective aims to create an inclusive culture in the IT industry that will increase gender diversity. It will also facilitate SLASSCOM's objectives to increase the number of female IT graduates, fulfilling the criteria of diversity in potential partners, building community wide awareness of career opportunities for women in IT and Business Process Management (BPM). The overarching aim is to empower women and girls to choose careers in IT and BPM and enabling them to remain and advance their careers in the sector.
Bani Chandrasena, Head of HR  Sri Lanka, London Stock Exchange Group said "Diversity Collective is a group of volunteers who have come together to further the agenda for diversity in the workplace. We believe that it is important to focus on diversity and an inclusive environment where all our people feel valued for who they are. Diversity Collective will strive to break down barriers by sharing experiences and encouraging future employees to realise their full potential in every aspect of life.
The initial focus of Diversity Collective will be across three pillars  schools, higher education, and corporates  to attract, grow, and retain females into IT and BPM careers. They aim to attract female students to follow STEM subjects that are important in the pursuance of IT as a career, and then guide young women towards a career in IT/BPM sector. For women already in the sector, Diversity Collective will focus on retention, empowerment and growth.
Under the school and higher education pillars, educative forums and interactive discussions have been held for students studying ICT as a career path. Participants were taken through a series of programmes that address common misconceptions about the industry. Under the theme Marketing Yourself, they also had the opportunity to learn about the fundamentals of corporate etiquette, interview techniques and recruitment policies.

Lift Facebook ban - PHU
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila yesterday urged the government to lift the temporary blockade on social media imposed on March 7 following the unrest that took place in Kandy, in order to prevent the spread of hate speech.
The clashes in Kandy are now over. Curfew has been lifted. Emergency declaration will also be ended in next few days. But unfortunately government is very reluctant to lift the ban on Facebook and other social media, he said.
Addressing the media yesterday at Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Office in Pitakotte, MP Gammanpila charged that the government is now hunting social media under the guise of controlling the hatred campaign. He further said that during last few years Facebook remained as the main element which continuously supported the anti government elements to raise their voice against the government. So the government is now in the need of controlling Facebook and other social media sites in order to control anti government elements in the country.
Being a lawful citizen especially who is endangered to be arrested at any time, I never used any social media during the period of ban. But the youth who logged in to their accounts using some technical tools currently available to enter Facebook ignoring the ban found that the President and the Prime Minister have not only logged in to their Facebook profiles, but had continuously published posts on Facebook. Gammanpila charged.
He said that the the President and the Prime Minister should have set an example for others to follow. But they have completely violated their own ban.
So we urge the government to lift the ban on Facebook immediately, otherwise we will join hands with millions of Sri Lankan youth to fight against this ban, Gammanpila said.

NCE calls for decisive action by Government related to recent civil unrest
National Chamber of Exporters as the premier Chamber in the fore front of the private sector for the promotion and development of exports from Sri Lanka for overall national benefit, is deeply concerned regarding the civil unrest which prevailed in certain parts of the country recently.
The Chamber is strongly of the view that the actions of certain elements which led to the recent civil unrest would have been backed by groups with extremist political ideologies who have as their objective disruption of economic activities, and the well-being of the ordinary citizens of our country, to achieve their parochial and selfish aims, without any regard to the future of our country.
The Chamber emphasis the fact that International Trade, particularly Exports and related Investments, is the lifeblood of our country to achieve economic development objectives, for the future prosperity of all citizens.
In this context, and at a time the Government is engaged through Public Private Partnerships, and sound International Relationships, acceleration of economic development; it is vital that the wrong message is not conveyed to the external world, regarding the peace and stability that has been built up since the conclusion in 2009 of the protracted 30 year Civil conflict, which caused untold economic damage and set-back to the aspirations of all peace loving citizens, who wish to live in harmony to secure their future.
The Chamber further states that it was very disconcerting that this civil unrest, although short lived,occurred at a time the country was embarking on trade negotiations to establish several Free Trade and Economic Partnership Agreements with important partner countries, to facilitate trade and especially exports, to achieve national economic development targets, because the success of these trade deals depends upon other things, attraction of Foreign Investments to the country which in turn depends on peace, economic, and political stability.
In this context the Chamber urges that the Government acts decisively to give a strong message to all, and especially to the trade partners of the country overseas,that there will be no room in the future for such civil unrest. For this purpose the Chamber calls upon the Government to act without any delay on the following, to restore the confidence and goodwill of all concerned.
1. Dispense quick and firm punishment to all those who were directly or indirectly responsible for the unrest, to deter any such actions in the future.
2. Provide full compensation to all those who were affected to rebuild their businesses and lives, to enable integration back to society in a meaningful manner without hard feelings.

Preparing for On The Run 2 Tour
Superstars Beyonce and JAY-Z are heading out on a new joint tour this summer, according to a leaked concert listing posted online. Fans were sent into a frenzy on March 5) after a July 30 gig at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was uploaded to Beyonce's official Facebook page and ticket purchasing website Ticketmaster.
The event was named as part of the On the Run 2 Tour, the follow up to the hip-hop supercouple's last joint trek in 2014.
The Ticketmaster pre-sale had been scheduled to begin on March 6, but shortly after the news gained traction online, both listings were mysteriously taken down.
Rumours of another joint tour have been circulating for months, and in November, rap mogul JAY-Z revealed they had actually been working on a full-length collaborative project before choosing to first put out their deeply-personal solo albums, which both addressed their marital issues.
Beyonce's Lemonade release hit retailers in 2016, just over a year before the Empire State of Mind icon shared his latest material, 4:44.
"We were using our art almost like a therapy session," he told the New York Times Style magazine, "and we started making music together. And then the music she was making at that time was further along. So her album came out, as opposed to the joint album that we were working on."
However, the artists, who are now parents of three, haven't ruled out revisiting the joint project in the future: "We still have a lot of that music," the rapper explained.
Meanwhile, Beyonce is busy preparing for her live comeback at California's Coachella music and arts festival in April, her first performances since giving birth to twins last summer.
On March 2, the singer revealed she has gone vegan again to help her prepare for her stage return.
"44 days until Coachella!! Vegan Time!!," she wrote on Instagram, alongside a photo of an avocado dish as she encouraged followers to check out her 22 Days Nutrition meal delivery plan, adding, "join me".
She also posted two snaps from what appeared to be her concert rehearsals.
Beyonce had initially been booked as a headliner for the 2017 Coachella line-up, but was replaced by Lady Gaga after pulling out due to her pregnancy.

Rabada banned for two Tests
Port Elizabeth: South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada was on Monday banned for the two remaining Tests against Australia  and admitted that he would have to change how he celebrates wickets.
Rabada was found guilty of inappropriate and deliberate physical contact with Australian captain Steve Smith after dismissing Smith in the first innings.
He was fined 50 percent of his match fee and issued three demerit points after a disciplinary hearing following his denial of the charge.
That took his total of points after three previous offences to eight and triggered an automatic two-Test ban.
Its going to have to stop, he said. Im letting the team down and letting myself down.
He was speaking after a man of the match performance in South Africas six-wicket win in the second Test against Australia, but before the verdict from the International Cricket Council was announced.
Cricket South Africa (CSA) immediately announced they had 48 hours to appeal the decision and were seeking legal opinion. CSA said Rabada would remain suspended unless a judicial commissioner was appointed early and allowed him to play pending a final decision.
Rabada accepted a second charge after a send-off of David Warner in the second innings and received a further fine of 15 percent of his match fee and an additional demerit point.
Match referee Jeff Crowe said: I found that there was contact between Rabada and Smith, and in my judgement the contact by Rabada was inappropriate, and deliberate.
He had the opportunity to avoid the contact, and I could not see any evidence to support the argument that the contact was accidental.
It is also disappointing that this has happened the day after the pre-match meeting I had with both teams, where the importance of respect for opponents was highlighted.
Rabada said he would need to avoid getting into close proximity with opponents.
I wont change the way I express myself but I will get far away from the batter, he said. AFP

Rabada sets up South Africa win
Port Elizabeth: Kagiso Rabada put aside his disciplinary concerns to set up a series-levelling win for South Africa on the fourth day of the second Test against Australia at St Georges Park on Monday.
South Africa won by six wickets after Rabadas fast bowling ensured they needed to chase a modest 101 runs for victory.
The fast bowler, who faces a ban from the remaining two Tests of the series, took six for 54 as Australia were bowled out for 239 in their second innings.
South Africa lost four wickets before Theunis de Bruyn hit the winning runs.
AB de Villiers, whose 126 not out enabled South Africa to lead by 139 runs on the first innings, hit a quick 28 off 26 balls before he was caught at short leg off Nathan Lyon with 20 runs still needed.
Rabada took the first three of the five Australian wickets that fell for the addition of 59 runs on Monday.
He had match figures of 11 for 150  the fourth time in his 28-Test career that he had ten or more wickets in a match.
There was a shadow hanging over the 22-year-old fast bowler, however.
He attended a disciplinary meeting convened by match referee Jeff Crowe on Sunday night after being charged with a level two offence following an incident in which his shoulder made contact with Australian captain Steve Smith on the first day.
The verdict was expected to be announced after the match. If found guilty Rabada will face a two-Test ban because of previous offences on his record.
Rabada was hit with a further charge on Monday, a level one offence, following a send-off of David Warner on Sunday.
Rabada struck in the first over of the morning when he bowled Mitchell Marsh for 45 with a ball which swung in sharply.
Pat Cummins fell to a sharp catch at gully by Theunis de Bruyn and Mitchell Starc edged a drive to wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock.
Lyon was caught behind off Lungi Ngidi and last man Josh Hazlewood hit a quick 17 before being caught in the deep off left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj.
Tim Paine was left unbeaten on 28.
Lyon was brought on for the last over before lunch and with his first ball caught Dean Elgar off a leading edge as the left-handed batsman stretched forward. It was a near-replica of Elgars dismissal to the off-spinner in the first innings of the first Test in Durban.
Aiden Markram had an escape in the second over of South Africas chase. With his score on six he was dropped at first slip by Mitchell Marsh off Hazlewood.
Markram made 21 before he was caught by Smith at second slip off Hazlewood.
Hashim Amla and De Villiers added 49 before both were dismissed with the total on 81. Amla was caught behind off Pat Cummins for 27 and De Villiers fell to Lyon three balls later. AFP

A recipe with a soul
When one stays or dines at the Hilton the experience is fabulous. The Hilton itself is a palace. The food is mouthwatering and delicious. But we tend to forget that all of this is the result of the unison of the Body, Mind and Spirit of the Chef. The food is a result of the talent and hard work of himself and his staff.
Recently Hilton awarded wand 11 Team Members with the companys most prestigious recognition: the 2017 CEO Light & Warmth Award. The annual accolade celebrates Team Members from across levels and geographies who consistently over-deliver on the job and model the companys values of Hospitality, Integrity, Leadership, Teamwork, Ownership and Now.
Daily News spoke to Botheju whose arena and domain is the Kitchen. There he is the supreme master ensuring that those who visit the Hilton have a really great time eating the sumptuous food. Botheju rose to where he is from the very bottom.
Straight after school I joined Hilton and this was my first job. My first job was as a kitchen helper. Through a lot of work and training, step by step I became what I am now  a Sous Chef at Hilton Colombo and Sri Lankan Cuisine Head Chef. It has been a lot of hard work, commitment and dedication, said Botheju.
Sri Lankan curries and spices

Botheju has been with the Hilton for almost 21 years. It has been a dream come true for him since from his early days he wanted to work at a five star hotel. He was very interested in the culinary field because this was his passion.
This passion for the culinary field was driven by the fact that I wanted to popularize Sri Lankan food in the world. Because to be honest with you I am very proud to be a Sri Lankan. This was something I had since childhood. This was why I chose to do Sri Lankan Cuisine. Because I had a talent for it. You get Western and Chinese food all around the world but what about Sri Lankan In many parts around the world, people do not know about Sri Lankan Cuisine. They do not know Sri Lankan curries and spices. So I feel it is my duty and passion to make our foods better known throughout the world. Our food is so tasty and unique, explained Botheju.
Botheju is ambitious and wants to rise in this profession. A man who comes from humble beginnings he has got to where he is now by doing it the hard way.
Because of the Hilton, I go abroad and do Sri Lankan food promotions. Recently I went to Turkey and Poland and showed people who wonderful Sri Lankan food is. In a way I am doing a service to Sri Lanka as well, because the identity of a culture is also linked to its food. So this is why I want to generate interest amongst people abroad concerning our food, pointed out Botheju.
Botheju has an inspiring message to any young person out there, not only those who want to become chefs. He maintains that the sky is the limit.
skills and abilities
There is nothing that you cannot do out there. If you are determined and have will power you can move forward regardless of your circumstances and background. You need to sharpen your skills and develop your abilities. What I say is, go up through the ranks and start from the bottom so you know the industry inside out and no one can hoodwink you. Then in addition to your ability you will have the knowledge, which is absolutely necessary. There are opportunities out there for you. There are no instant noodles! This is something anyone can do, if you put your mind to it there is nothing you cannot do, explained Botheju.
When Botheju joined Hilton he knew nothing. It was a journey that was arduous in a way. Twenty one years is a long time. Through these two decades he has persevered. There were challenges but he is indebted to Hilton for making him who he is today. Today he has a family of his own and now he is comfortable.
Hilton is not only a hotel for me. It is a school. It is a University. There are plenty of opportunities to show your quality and to develop your knowledge. I have amassed a lot of knowledge at Hilton. It has really helped me in my journey. Yes, there are challenges but if there are no challenges you cannot grow. But Hilton held my hand right throughout and together we overcame the challenges, added Botheju.
Botheju states that there is potential in this industry. You are able to grow and develop. He definitely recommends this vocation to anyone out there. He feels the industry is doing well. It is excellent for someone with ambition.
If you have a target in life, if you have dedication, then you have the scope to develop your powers. If there is something you want you can get it. I have achieved some of the highest accolades that someone could ever hope to get in this culinary field. I have trained in every Kitchen in Hilton  Sri Lanka, Indian and Chinese. That took two years and I chose Sri Lankan. I dedicated myself to mastering Sri Lankan Cuisine. From the bottom to the top. I took part in various programs. So it has been a long journey with hardships. But you need to face these hardships otherwise you cannot grow. Then there is value. My secret to success is dedication and honest service, said Botheju.
When it comes to Sri Lankan food, there are uncommon ones, which he tries to discover and try and promote. Food that is not known amongst even Sri Lankans. He feels that when foreigners come to Sri Lanka they begin to like Sri Lankan foods.
Secret for success
I must say that the General Manager of Colombo Hilton is a great support to us. All the Department Heads and Management are very helpful to us. They encourage us and spur us on. This hotel is like a family. We are united. And that is the secret for our success, said Botheju.
This year, nearly 1,000 Team Members submitted CEO Light & Warmth Award nominations, and Nassetta and a committee of representatives from across the company selected the 12 recipients. Each recipient received a $10,000 bonus, among other prizes. Hilton has awarded more than $690,000 since the recognition was established in 2009.
Over the last nearly 100 years, Hilton has spread the light and warmth of hospitality to countless guests around the world thanks to our incredible Team Members. We know that our people are our greatest asset, and thats why we believe it is important to celebrate their contributions. Our 2017 CEO Light & Warmth Award recipients are truly inspiring, purposeful individuals, and it is an honor to recognize them for their tremendous positive impact, said President and CEOP Hilton, Christopher J. Nassetta.
The CEO Light & Warmth Award is one of many ways Hilton recognizes and supports its 380,000 Team Members around the globe to ensure they are driven and motivated and that they flourish in their lives and through this even Hilton is further strengthened. It aims to drive more mindful leadership and transform the way Team Members think about work.

Reluctant to perform at own wedding
Ed Sheeran has insisted it would be "a little bit weird" to perform at his own wedding. The British singer-songwriter, 27, who revealed his engagement to his former schoolmate Cherry Seaborn in January, is a favourite choice for couples on their special day, but he has so far been reluctant to divulge details of his own marriage plans.
However he did reveal on Australian radio programme The Kyle and Jakie O Show, that he was unlikely to act as his own wedding singer.
Asked if he would perform at his own nuptials, Ed, who is on tour down under, told hosts Kyle Sandilands and Jackie Henderson that, "It would be a little bit weird" if he did so.
Last month, the star moved to quash rumours he and Cherry had already tied the knot, explaining that a ring he was wearing on his wedding finger was in fact an engagement band his fiancee had made for him as he believed they should both wear tokens of their love.
In his interview with the KIIS FM presenters, the Thinking Out Loud singer revealed another reason behind his break with tradition - as fans would not notice when he replaced the ring with a wedding one.
"We didn't get secretly married, no, she made me this ring out of silver clay, so we were both kinda wearing rings," he explained. "It also means that nobody will know when we have got married."
One possible venue for their wedding is Ed's own estate in Suffolk, England - as he recently submitted plans under the name of Cherry's architect dad Matthew to officials at East Suffolk Council requesting permission to build a chapel.
The planning application states that the chapel will be for the couple's personal use for "retreat for contemplation and prayer", and will not be available for hire to the public.
Council officials will decide whether to approve the plans by April.

RPCs rosy plans insufficient to assure true sustainability
Regional Plantation companies (RPCs) at every forum, make vain attempts to give a very rosy generalized picture of their plans, investments and performance but these are barely sufficient to assure true sustainability, said Minister of Plantation Navin Dissanayake.
There is a serious crisis blooming in the plantation sector and those troubled RPCs cannot take an ostrich approach and heap self-praise on themselves.
He was addressing the first seminar on Sustainability of Plantation Management (NIPM) organized by the National Institute of Plantation Management at its auditorium.
Sri Lanka cannot condone this existing dysfunctional industry structure any longer, the minister emphasized.
Restructuring in inevitable and is in fact long overdue. Our policy is to provide policy incentives to those good performers in category one, I hesitate to call them excellent performers as they can surely do very much better to reach sustainable global competitiveness.
We will anyway add judicious disincentives to underperform. The middle group will have to awaken from their slumber and we will throw buckets of icy cold water on them until they begin to climb up the ladder. We shall introduce an effective regime of monitoring and course corrections based on expert advice while leaving management autonomy in their own hands. We will be closely watching and they will be given a last chance to reform. Unless they change, the RPCs will change hands. This is an ultimatum.
To help RPCs to overcome the muddle, since they are not taking the initiative by themselves as responsible corporate citizens, learning from the best, we will introduce new management models that are to be developed collaboratively and not arbitrarily. I know that large plantation companies in other countries invest in millions of dollars, in tree crops. They look for the future and manage the present well. They do not live in the past. They do not run to governments or donors seeking handouts.
Government cannot dole out capital to RPCs. If they are entrepreneurial and risk taking, sourcing funds from capital markets is not an issue.
I would say RPCs need a Meiji restoration. Let young samurais takeover. Next five years will be challenging for all of us. Unless we face these challenges squarely, our nation has no future.
It is already too late and there is a need for quick decisions and radical changes. If not, this government will be kicked out soon. Next government too will face the same tune.

Scientific Cabinet reshuffle after President returns: Minister
A Cabinet reshuffle will take place in a scientific manner after the conclusion of President Maithripala Sirisena's tour of India and Japan, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and Mahaweli State Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Minister Amaraweera said so following an inspection tour of the Ihala Elahera Ela project, affiliated to the Moragahakanda Reservoir on March 11.
The Minister said the President had decided that a mere change of heads in the Cabinet was superfluous unless a reshuffle was done scientifically by allocating subjects to Ministers having subject-wise knowledge and experience.
He said the Moragahakanda Reservoir project had been a dream of President Maithripala Sirisena and its full implementation would be a reality soon. He said he undertook the inspection tour on the direction of the President to look into outstanding issues and resolve them.
He also said the Ihala Elahera Ela project had an environment -friendly tunnel system.
Responding to questions raised by the media regarding the temporary ban on social media websites, Minister Amaraweera said there were two schools of thought on the issue. One said it should be totally banned while the other maintained that it should come under some sort of control. He said China for instance, had completely banned social media websites. Since a large number of people, including the President, were being subjected to character assassination through the social media websites and Facebook, laws would be introduced to bring them under some sort of control.
Industries Deputy Minister Vasantha Perera, Matale District Parliamentarian Rohini Kaviratne and the minister said big time businessmen were responsible for the high price of rice in the open market as they are involved in buying container loads of imported rice in Colombo and transporting them to rice mills for re-sale on the pretext of local rice in separate bags at a higher price.
Moragahakanda project officials were also present on the occasion.

SD petition filed challenging bill entitled Judicature (Amendment)
A Special Determination petition challenging the bill entitled Judicature (Amendment), a Bill to amend the Judicature Act No.2 of 1978 was yesterday filed before Supreme Court by Colombo District Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena seeking a declaration that bill shall become law only through a two-thirds majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum.
The petitioner stated that a Bill entitled Judicature (Amendment) was presented to the Parliament and placed on Order Paper of the Parliament on March 6, 2018.
The Petitioner states that clauses 2, 3 and 4, of the said Bill, are in violation of and inconsistent with Articles 3, 4(a), (b) (c), 12(1), 12(2), 13(3),14, 14(1)(g) 27, 75, 83 and/84(2) and the other Articles of the Constitution, in as much as the said Bill inter alia.
The petitioner said the Bill would vest in the executive with arbitrary powers to decide as to whom to be tried before the proposed High Court and thereby deprive the citizens of equal application of the Criminal Procedure, which is essential for the upholding of the Rule of Law.
He further said the bill would remove Judicial functions from the Judiciary and entrust the same with the executive, which is amounting to breach of the fundamental principle of separation of powers, which is recognised by the Constitution.
He further said it would indirectly empowers the Attorney General and the Director General for the Prevention of Bribery and Corruption to use the findings of the investigations carried out by purported ad-hoc units of the police, such as FCID (Financial Crime Investigation Division), which are not lawfully established and incapable of executing lawful actions.
MP Gunawardena further said the Bill would take away the right of an Accused to be represented by a Counsel of his choice, a significant and inalienable element of his right to a fair trial enshrined in Article 13(3) of the Constitution, by providing that the inability of an Attorney-at-Law to appear before the High Court at Bar shall not be a ground for postponing the trial.
It is capricious and unreasonable in that it seeks to take away the right of Attorneys-at-Law to engage in their professional practice.
The Bill would Incorporate offences without any rationale and affecting the functions of the public officers; which shall adversely affect the daily functions and powers to make administrative decisions of the public servants with a free mind in executing statutory functions conferred upon them.
This special determination petition was filed through senior counsel Kanishka Vitharana and counsel Tissa Jayawardena Yapa.

Seventy-five percent of the construction work of the Moragahakanda-Kalu Ganga Multi-Purpose Development Project has been completed, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and Mahaveli Development State Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
President Maithripala Sirisena had instructed Minister Amaraweera to look into the progress of the project before he left for his official foreign tour. Minister Amaraweera hence made visited the Moragahakanda-Kalu Ganga Project site and discussed the problems of the public, with officials.
It is planned to provide water to the Moragahakanda Reservoir through a 9-km long canal from the Kalu Ganga reservoir. This reservoir was constructed to provide water for more than 400 acres of farming lands and to develop the fresh water fish industry, in addition to the provision of drinking water to people in many of the surrounding districts.
Minister Amaraweera said that the estimated cost of the Moragahakanda-Kalu Ganga Project, which is a concept of President Maithripala Sirisena, is USD 136 billion. He added that it is planned to provide water to 100 mini-reservoirs from the main reservoir.
The minister also said this project is a wonder among irrigation projects within the country, in the 21st century.
He added that the construction of these two reservoirs are underway with a far-sighted, timely and environmental-friendly view.

Shanthi Peiris a superb cricket analyst
It really was a thrill for me to bump into Shanthi Peiris at the Parliament walking track after 53 years long years. We last met and played in our big match at the Oval in 1965. Shanthi was the unfortunate captain of the losing Nalanda team and I was the fortunate vice captain of the victorious Ananda team. A.G.Perera who had a magnificent game captained Ananda.
Although it was more than a half a century ago where we displayed our off spinning skills at that big match. I could recognise Shanthi immediately, his prominent nose, the broad shoulders and the shuffling gait was unmistakeable. I was baffled by Shanthis sharp memory; he knew every minute detail of that match. On paper the Nalanda team was the weaker of the two. He was quite emphatic to point out that he had a team full of freshers, 8 of them to be precise. Shanthi vividly recalls that the Anandians were so cocky about their victory that a rumour was in the air that the Anandians were to win the match in a day. Shanthi agreed that it was psychological warfare.
Ananda won the toss and elected to bat and the Anandian openers A.G. Perera and Ananda Sumanadasa went off to a comfortable start with A.G. belting a couple of boundaries in quick succession but with the score at 19, Perera fell to a full blooded pull shot smartly taken by Amaraweera. Ananda thereafter had a mini collapse, 3 wickets going down within the space of half an hour. Although the wicket was ideal for batting it was poor batting by the Anandians that led to that mini collapse. At that stage Ananda pinned their hopes on G.C. Perera and on me who had a century under my belt in the previous year against St Benedicts. That partnership blossomed to 70 runs in 77 minutes when I got out for 25 runs. Brilliant bowling by Shanthi accounted for Lalith Gunaratne and Sunil Wettimuny. Meanwhile Perera batted stolidly, scoring 57 runs in two hours. Ananda folded up for 122 runs, on the final analysis Shanthi was quick to point out that the partnership of Perera and De Silva (sounds a bit like a firm of chartered accountants, yes they were adding to the credit balance) was of immense value and Shanthi adds that Ananda would have been in dire straits with a paltry score of 52 runs, if not for that partnership. Shanthi laments that 52 was chicken feed for them and they would have won that match! He had no regrets and stated that the game of cricket was the winner.
CLUB CRICKET
After leaving school, Shanthi was invited to play for Saracens by late Gerry Gooneratne. Saracens were on the verge of relegation at the time and Shanthi salvaged them. He played club cricket for 15 years. He was also picked for trial matches for the impending tour of Pakistan, which never took place due to the prevailing situation in the country at that time.
He was picked as the 12th man. Shanthi was of the opinion that club cricket then was of a higher standard than now for the obvious reason that few clubs participated at the highest level. Shanthi recalled that in his days there were bowlers of genuine pace with T.B. Kehelgamuwa topping the list and Sylvester Dias and stocky Norton Fredrick not far behind. In some instances, the bouncers they bowled were so quick that the moment Shanthi ducked, in double quick time he could hear the clang bang sound of the ball hitting the tin sight screen.
Those good old days Shanthi mentioned that thigh pads were never heard of and he was fed up of getting hit on the thighs from pacies and as a result he improvised a kind of a thigh pad which was homemade. Shanthi went to the nets wearing this contraption and Gerry Gooneratne spotted this and asked Shanthi to remove it saying that if you have a good eye all you need is a bat to defend yourself. These words were uttered by that famous coach simply due to the reason that he knew Shanthi was a fantastic on side player and hence needed no protection for his left thigh. Another important point, Gerry Gooneratne pointed out was that to duck if the ball was head high on the leg side and weave if it was whistling past your face. Shanthi does not think much of the helmets that are worn these days.
Shanthi too is critical about the modern day coach and stated that they should be knowledgeable and independent.
He has a lot feathers in his cap: Shanthi has coached Nalanda, Royal and Wesley and stresses that he was not in the habit of cowing down to the old boys who have become a major menace in leading schools today.
He too has a sort of a record in captaining 3 Division one sides namely Saracens, CCC and Liberty CC.
Shanthi was full of admiration for Chandika Hathurusingha. The unassuming Shanthi is really an unsung hero, he still dabbles in coaching.
Our budding cricketers could learn a lot from this guy who has gone thru the mill in all aspects of cricket and never hesitated to call a spade a spade.

Sixth annual Capital Markets Conference to feature discussions on Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies
Following successful events held in the past five years, UTO EduConsult together with KPMG as Knowledge Partner and Adl Capital as key event partner will organise the 6th Annual Capital Markets Conference on March 21, 2018 at the Ramada, Colombo.
In a year that witnessed several significant events that could have a profound impact on the Capital Markets, the year 2017 was surely a Transformative one.
The Inland Revenue Act, the Foreign Exchange Act as well as the SEC Act were indeed the most significant changes to regulations that have elicited intense discussion at many a forum. The use of Cryptocurrencies, most notably Bitcoin, has witnessed unprecedented interest, whilst discussions revolving round the use of Blockchain Technology, Fintech and Digital Disruption have also featured very prominently.
The past year has also seen a spate of acquisitions, especially among some of the more prominent listed entities.
The M&A activity has straddled many sectors and have not been limited to any specific industries. There was also a flurry of Private Equity deals, which may suggest a renewed interest in what was a somewhat nascent sector.
It is expected to feature several distinguished personnel from areas that impact the capital market industry in Sri Lanka and would also feature speakers from overseas. This event has fast become an integral feature of the calendar of events pertaining to the financial sector, encapsulating the various sectors of the Capital Markets industry at a single forum.
The conference comprises a format that mainly encompasses panel discussions, interspersed with presentations covering contemporary areas of interest, such as the new Acts, Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies.
The panellist would also deliberate on some of the key changes in the Regulatory landscape, Digital Transformation and the heightened interest in the area of Socially Responsible Investing.
For the first time, a breakout session will be held, albeit on an Invitation only basis, on a topic titled Public Utility on Blockchain  Blockchain for Banks.
This will be hosted by an international organisation, FORUS Global Digital Exchange of South Africa and will feature Sonny Fisher, Founder / CEO, Dr Ghefari Dulapandan, Chief Investment Officer Firstcoin & Board Member, Andras Szekely, IT Director of Firstcoin.

Skin colour obsessions
Paris Jackson has asked fans to stop changing her skin tone before sharing pictures of her on social media.
Fans of Michael Jackson's daughter regularly use pictures of the 19-year-old looking glam on the red carpet or candid in a social media snap and repost them on their own accounts, and sometimes make changes to the images.
However, Paris has now asked them to stop making edits to her skin tone when editing and sharing pictures of her on social media.
"i appreciate everything yall make for me, i enjoy every single edit i see," she tweeted on March 6.
"but please stop lightening my skin to make me look more white. and please stop darkening my skin to make me look more mixed. i am what i am. im aware of what i look like and i finally happy with it."
The budding actress, the daughter of the Billie Jean hitmaker and former nurse Debbie Rowe, previously opened up about her skin colour to Rolling Stone magazine, telling them in a January, 2017 cover interview that people usually think she's white.
"I consider myself black," she said, adding later that her dad "would look me in the eyes and he'd point his finger at me and he'd be like, 'You're black. Be proud of your roots.' And I'd be like, 'OK, he's my dad, why would he lie to me' So I just believe what he told me. 'Cause, to my knowledge, he's never lied to me.
"Most people that don't know me call me white... I've got light skin and, especially since I've had my hair blonde, I look like I was born in Finland or something."
Paris recently made her movie debut in action-comedy Gringo, and she was supported by her brother Prince as she hit the red carpet in a black Gucci gown at the Los Angeles premiere on Tuesday night.

Social media blockage to be lifted
Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando yesterday said the restrictions on social media platforms including Facebook, Viber, WhatsApp and Imo will most probably be lifted within the next 24 hours.
The Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) was in discussion with the Facebook service provider about filtering social media, it was also noted.
These social media platforms were suspended last week as a preventive measure taken by the government to curb the spreading of fake news and rumours on the tensed situation in Kandy last week.
There were several claims that the restriction will be lifted soon. However, the ban was not lifted as at last morning.
Meanwhile, Policy Planning and Economic Affairs State Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva, in a Twitter message stated that he had a lengthy discussion with the Secretary to the President Austin Fernando and the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Chairman explaining the negative impact on the economy.
A large number of online businesses carried out on the Face book and other platforms were affected by the blockade.
Meanwhile, US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Atul Keshap in his official Twitter page stated that Social media is an imperfect, evolving, and fluid platform that uses new technology to connect and reflect human societies as a whole, including the good and bad. Hate-filled people who exploit new ways to fan the flames of intolerance and violence are the real main culprits. Meanwhile, the newly appointed Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara had told journalists in Kandy that new laws will be introduced to prevent the spread of hate speech and false information through social media.
He had said that false information churned out by some individuals over social media had led to the clashes in Kandy compelling the government to promulgate emergency laws after a lapse of three years.
President Maithripala Sirisena promulgated a state of Emergency for a limited period of one week by bringing into force Section 2 of the Public Security Ordinance, last Tuesday following the unrest in some areas of the Kandy District.
Student remanded for spreading hate content on Facebook
Lakmal Sooriyagoda
A student of a leading school in Colombo arrested for allegedly spreading hate content on Facebook when the government had declared state of Emergency following the unrest in the Kandy district, was yesterday ordered to be remanded till March 26 by the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court.
The suspect was arrested by the CID for allegedly spreading racial sentiments on social media, in a manner of causing damage to countrys ethnic and religious harmony.
The defences request to release the suspect on bail was rejected by Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara citing that he does not have jurisdiction to make such order.
The CID alleged that the suspect had committed an offence coming under the purview of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 of 2007.

Solar Alliance can bring about solutions to create greener, cleaner, healthy world  President Sirisena
President Maithripala Sirisena expressed confidence that the International Solar Alliance (ISA) would showcase the power of the countries in this Alliance to bring about solutions to create a greener, cleaner and a healthy environment for people of this world.
Addressing the Founding Conference of the ISA Summit in New Delhi on March 11, he said the deliberations of the Conference will navigate the joint efforts of the countries in the Alliance towards practical cooperation and expressed the hope that the rest of the Global community will join forces with the Alliance.
The President pointed out that the worlds population growth has caused an increase in the energy demand and said solar energy can alleviate this problem. The energy crisis is a major problem faced by the people in Sri Lanka as well as by the people living in several developed and developing countries in the world, he said.
Briefing the delegates about Sri Lankas initiatives in solar energy, President Sirisena said, In Sri Lanka we have already commenced a programme called Suriya Bala Sangramaya that is a battle for Solar Power. Through this project we expect to generate 1000 megawatt of electricity by the year 2025.
He said that Sri Lanka is also in the process of developing 01 megawatt to 10 megawatt capacity solar power systems to assist small and medium level industries.
I am very grateful to ISA and Prime Minister Modi for extending support for these major solar projects in Sri Lanka under this programme. This will benefit several homes, schools, hospitals, infrastructure and government facilities in my country, he said.
President Sirisena thanked French President Macron and Indian Prime Minister Modi for their leadership to make the ISA initiative a success and pointed out the presence of such a large number of Government Heads and Government Representatives is a significance of the importance of ISA Summit.
He assured the world leaders about Sri Lankas strong commitment to support this Alliance.

Solar power for state institutions in Kegalle
Solar energy is a very economical. But introducing a concept of this nature to society is a difficult task, like trying to swim upstream, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He made this observation at a ceremony to distribute solar power systems to all divisional secretariats of the Kegalle District.
The minister said that the ministry has already taken measures to provide solar power systems to all main state institutions and religious places.
Religious places and state institutions such as divisional secretariats play a leading role among the people of Sri Lanka. By providing solar power systems to those places, we can educate our people in villages about solar power and direct them towards using it, said the Minister.
Minister Siyambalapitiya further said that the Ceylon Electricity Board has pledged to pay Rs. 22 per unit (Kwh) which is added to the national grid by consumers who use solar power.
The ultimate target is to establish one million solar-powered houses, he said.

Symphony of the soul
At the concert presented by the Albert A. Page Foundation concert  An evening of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts Piano Concertos KV 414, 413 and 415 featuring Louis Page and Principal Members of the Chamber Music Society of Colombo we heard some very beautiful music. Yet listening carefully, each of us heard something very different and personal.
Louis Page Jr. is a Sri Lankan- American pianist. He was a gifted pianist from a very early age. He gave his first American recital in Los Angeles in 2002. He is a graduate of the California Institute of the Arts. That is Louis Page the man - an incredibly gifted pianist. That was obvious when listening to him playing at the concert.
Yet at the concert we got to know his soul. We listened to the man behind the music. We heard his sensitivity. We heard his concentration. While hearing the enchanting music, we also listened to his soul. Those of us sensed his concentration. We heard his mind working.
We all listened to something else as well. We listened to Mozart. He was there with us as well. We listened to him through Page. He was there in memory. He was there in song. It was like he was there, sitting next to us with a smile on his face. Seeing, though dead physically. Seeing how much pleasure his music was giving.
The music made by him was emerging through Pages soul. Mozart and Louis Page were for a while one person. And we felt Mozart through Pages music. It was like we were all transported through time to Mozarts day and age. That really was how good the music was that evening.
Time in that hall had suddenly stopped. We were in a timeless void only to be disturbed by the internal. Then we were suddenly back in the Lionel Wendt. And Mozart was gone. But then again he was there again when the concert resumed.
Every concert is different because you hear the man or woman behind the music. That is what you truly listen to, the soul behind the music.
The music was ethereal and it was so harmonious. The performers all really worked in unison. It really was marvelous to watch. Music is a universal language because it speaks to your soul. It is that connection with the music maker and the listener because your souls are connected, not the mind. Music is in your soul. The mind hears but the soul listens.
Listening and hearing are two different things. Your mind hears and your brain hears but only your soul can listen to music. And when your soul listens, you hear a very different music.
We all listened to how sensitive Page is. We all sensed a certain yearning within him. Perhaps he himself did not realize how his soul connected with us that evening. Yes, he may have understood how beautiful the music was that evening, yet he did not realize what insights into life his music would convey to the audience. Because when you are connected by the soul, the listener is able to enter a very different world.
Sitting there in our seats, we were able truly appreciate life. The music opened our hearts, to how big the world is and how the great cosmos holds answers to some of ours biggest questions in life.
And above all the music allowed us the greatest happiness. And that was to get completely lost. Because when you are completely lost, that is when the greatest happiness is, because when you are lost it is marvelous. To get lost in music is so empowering. To get lost in the world is a way of finding the true path.
All of this knowledge is in the music. The instruments merely channel the energy of the performers. They are not engineers using their musical instruments. They are musicians using their minds, bodies and souls. The music is in their souls. The instruments merely channel it.
Those who played alongside were Lakshman Joseph De Saram on the Violin, Cynthia Fernando on the Violin, Ursular Nelius on the Violin, Othman Hassan Majid on the Viola, Magdalena Sas on Violoncello and Nilanthi Weerakoon on contrabass with Artistic Director Tedd Joselson.
They all made that could only be attributed to sheer talent. That evening everyone at the Lionel Wendt was treated to something really special and splendid.
Of course this is not to say that Page is of the same caliber as that of Mozart. To claim to be as great as the great Mozart one needs to be really something! But one has the privilege to be given the opportunity to invite Mozart into ones soul and through that, bring to life Mozarts music.
Yes the music was lovely to listen to but so was the soul. Outside the Lionel Wendt it was a warm night. What a lovely way to end the concert at night. With a myriad of stars are spread out through the heavens. Looking at them you can get lost and confused. And that is what music does. It allows you to become lost. What a concert it was! A truly memorable one! A truly classy performance! Some of the greatest in music!

Thai juntas rush to end southern insurgency leaves villages smoldering
Under the cover of darkness, Thai soldiers and paramilitary troops are raiding remote stretches of Thailands southernmost provinces to arrest suspected Malay-Muslim insurgents.
In January, hundreds of armed troops combed through Bannang Sata, a hilly area of forest and rubber plantations near the Malaysian border, where militants have staged attacks in an insurgency entering its 15th year. Soldiers have arrested more than 40 men during two forays here.
The sweep is the militarys response to a rebel attack weeks earlier, when 10 armed insurgents, dressed in camouflage, stopped a double-decker tour bus travelling along a desolate road in Bannang Sata. The rebels ordered the driver and passengers to step out of the bus and then set it on fire, although no one was injured. The arrested rebels are wanted for the bus attack.
Soldiers came at about 3 a.m. to our house and took away my son, said one mother, wrapped in a loose black robe from head to toe.
But there is another sense of urgency in the militarys sweep across Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala, the provinces where the Barisan Revolusi Nasional, or BRN, the largest and best-armed militant force in the region, is waging a separatist rebellion. The BRN is a shadowy group that remains largely hidden, and members do not reveal themselves as militants in public.
Thailands ruling military junta, led by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, has endorsed a counter-insurgency strategy to achieve a security deadline: to end the long-running conflict by 2018, the first target in a seven-point blueprint.
Tourist resorts
The junta has an economic reason for this rush, too. Meeting the security goal would bring relief in the tourist industry, which contributes 20% of the countrys gross domestic product. Popular resort areas, such as Phuket, are on the fringes of the fighting. And in recent years, the BRN has made selective strikes in tourist resorts beyond the troubled provinces.
To forge ahead, the military, which has 60,000 soldiers on the ground, has deployed its 15th infantry regiment in the vanguard. It is assisted by paramilitary ranger units on the frontlines.
The rangers operate as smaller units and are more mobile and flexible than the regular army, which moves as a company, said Don Pathan, an independent security analyst based in Yala. They have helped the army to expand its security grid to remote areas.
That has led to a burst of positive news for the junta, as the counter-insurgency strategy to disrupt the BRNs operating terrain reaps results.
According to Deep South Watch, an independent organisation monitoring the conflict, the insurgency-related death toll of 235 people last year was the lowest since the current cycle of violence began after militants stormed a military camp in January 2004. The highest number of deaths occurred in 2007, with 892.
The decline in deaths has been a boost for Prayuth and the junta, who are playing up the latest turn in the 14-year conflict, in which nearly 7,000 people have been killed and more than 12,500 have been injured.
Last Friday, the military staged a public-relations event with platoons of Malay-Muslim men -- who the military said were ex-militants that had been arrested and rehabilitated -- line up in a ceremonial handing-over of weapons in a military camp.
Counter-insurgency strategy
But the counter-insurgency strategy is stoking anger in rural enclaves, home to Malay-Muslims -- the largest minority in predominantly Buddhist Thailand. Villagers in Sai Buri and Nong Chik, in Pattani Province, are suffering under the nighttime raids by troops. They have been in the militarys crosshairs after the BRNs tit-for-tat strikes, in which paramilitary troops on patrol have been killed in ambushes. In one instance, the military encircled one village in Nong Chik after midnight in late January and arrested 18 men. Meanwhile, in Sai Buri, 10 men were nabbed in the same month.
They were taken because of a bombing near our village, said Noorisan Maseng, a mother of two in Nong Chik, whose husband has been detained at a military camp in Pattani. - Nikkei Asian Review

It is an interesting phenomenon in Sri Lanka that the very same people who bristle at the very suggestion of deficiencies in the Sri Lankan State and most vehemently argue against the need for either state reform or reconciliation, that through their uncivilized and indeed illegal actions, make the strongest case for both the urgent need for reforms and reconciliation in Sri Lanka.
What we witnessed in the past two weeks, puts us to shame as Sri Lankans, makes the need for state reform more important not less and in the failure of the Sri Lankan state to protect the person, properties and community (religious) infrastructure of her citizens, increases the severity of international community voices that question the ability and capability of Sri Lankas state institutions of law and order, justice and governance to ensure basic civilized behaviour within our borders. Having mini pogroms against ethnic or religious minorities is not the best advertisement for Sri Lanka at the UNHRC in Geneva.
Violence against Muslims
The past week witnessed the anti-Muslim violence in the Kandy District, which was preceded the previous week by similar, though lesser scale attacks in Ampara. This violence again, was no flash in the pan, the steady hate mongering campaign against the Muslim community has been in the making for at least five years, beginning most notably and seemingly benignly as an anti halal campaign. Both the Government, through the Prime Minister and law enforcement have acknowledged that the attacks on the Muslim community has been premeditated and organised. The so-called provocation in Ampara, that of orally administered (or mixed in food) impotency medication is a product non-existent in the world and the contrived paranoia would be laughable if it was not tragic.
The violence, especially in Kandy was also carefully calibrated to not result in the loss of life and limb but to destroy the economic assets of the Muslim community. Hence their homes, shops, vehicles and goods were targeted. In a particularly barbaric manner, Muslim places of worship, their mosques were attacked, vandalized, damaged and destroyed.
It is a particularly distressing aspect of Sri Lankas political violence that the sanctity of places of worship is not observed. In the very same Kandy, where during the war years, terrorists attacked the hallowed Sri Dalada Maligawa, to the condemnation of the whole world, in post war Sri Lanka, a new breed of terror was unleased on other places of worship. What we are witnessing in these attacks is not communal violence. It is not the Sinhala community against the Muslim community.
Most Sri Lankans of all ethnicities and religions long for a peaceful and prosperous post war Sri Lanka, undergirded for many by the most tolerant and non-violent noble precepts. What we are witnessing in Sri Lanka, are small fascist movements, intent on violence to achieve their socio-political objectives.
The Malwatta Mahanayake speaks out
The rather unfortunate and distinguishing feature of our own variety of fascism, as opposed to say the German Nazi or Italian fascists movements is that while European fascism was purely ethnic, Hitler being obsessed with his pure Aryan race, Mussolini with his new Romans, post war Sri Lankan fascism mixes in the added toxicity of a religious veneer into its characteristic, making it even more dangerous and fearsome than the European variety of yester year. It is in that context, that the statement of the Most Venerable Tibboutuwawe Sr Siddharatha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatta Chapter should become a guide post. The Prelate has observed that when there are state armed forces and the police to protect the country and the people, there is no need for auxiliary Balakayas and Balasenas to offer them protection.
A thinly veiled reference to the Ravanaya Balakaya and the Mahason Balasena, which are at the centre of investigations into the anti-Muslim violence, given their use of social media to spread their hate and publicize their violence. Video clips of the clergy rather than the laity, associated with those organisations, inciting people to mass murder no less, rests now on many servers, hard drives, sim cards and phones, making it virtually impossible to deny culpability.
The Venerable Mahanayake moreover clearly articulated his vision for the venerable Maha Sangha, by stating that if every temple guided the people of their devotee village on the correct path, the moral and social upliftment of the village would occur. The two ideas, namely that the Sanga should provide moral and spiritual guidance to the village community and that state and democratic processes and institutions are there for social and political objectives, taken together completely debunk any religious, spiritual or moral basis for the fascist campaign of political terror being engaged in by the Balakayas and Balasenas of Sri Lankan fascism.
Electoral gains
There is little doubt that the recent local level electoral gains of the Pohottuwa, opened the door for a fresh wave of anti-minority violence by the small fascist groups, drawing their inspiration and energy from the thinly veiled racism and ethno-religious nationalism, which are the hallmark of the tribal politics which the Rajapaksa comeback project employs. It opens up the space and opportunity for the kind of ethno-religious violence we observed. The fascists groups, their predecessors and embryos were also nursed both covertly and overtly during the Rajapaksa second term.
The Government has promised swift compensation to the victims of the violence, a Presidential commission or at least a committee to investigate the attacks and the Army to be deployed to rebuild homes and mosques which were destroyed. But the real loser from the events of the past several weeks, was post war reconciliation in Sri Lanka.
Developing a new Sri Lanka, where we have a unifying identity which overlays our ethnic or religious identities and a state which protects all her citizens irrespective of caste, creed or class were the fundamentals which was seriously damaged these past two weeks. Rebuilding those is harder work and not solely the preserve of the political leadership, but is a responsibility, for all of us.

Trinity edges out Antonians 15-11
Skipper Avishka Sheiks injury time try helped Trinity College edge past valiant St. Anthonys College by 15 points (3 tries) to 11 (1 try, 2 penalties) in an evenly poised inter-schools division I first round rugby match played at Nittawela grounds yesterday.
The winners should be thankful to their tireless set of forwards for this win.
At half time the Antonians led 11-5.
It was Antonians who led from the first half till injury time, but they had not brought the match winning luck from Katugastota. The Antonians should be credited for holding Trinity for the entire 70 minutes of play.
Led by Kavinda Amarakoon they deserve immense credit for the superb display of rugby. Though finishing on the losing side the way they played should give the Antonians confidence for the rest of their matches.
For Trinity Lenok Caliyaratne, Weron Weerakoon and Avishka Sheik scored the tries and for the Antonians the try came from Ishara Liyanage and the two penalties came off the boot of Mohamed Makarim.
H.P. Veranga refereed.
The under 16 game too went in favour of Trinity 24-12.

True leaders heart is the one that bridges the connection between him and his team members
Imagine for a moment that you work in a cherished company and your team shared a common goal, or standard for excellence in your work. Imagine your leader believed your team could and would be able to be the best at what you do. What if your leader was out on the front line paying attention to the things your team did right and noting how your team contributed or how your team exceeded standards
And what if your leader took the time to talk about your teams accomplishments and actually discussed which team members really went above and beyond normal expectations. Then, imagine further that he gathered your team all in a room to tell the story of your teams accomplishment, to enjoy the moment of celebration and remind your team of the companys common goal.
I imagine that would somehow set an example of positive belief in your teams abilities and worth in what they are doing. I also imagine that would help you to solidify your understanding of what you and your team are trying to achieve and how you could contribute more.
The moral of the story is simple. The heart of a leader must be a caring one. Without this heart, his leadership will be without purpose. A leader's heart is the one that bridges the connection between him and his team members.
Opening Oneself
Everything starts within as a leader. Most leaders fail to recognize the efforts of others because expressing genuine appreciation means showing emotions. For most people expressing emotions is a weakness. This is what happened to someone I know. He was afraid of praising his staff and their good work because he did not want to be perceived as playing favourites. However, he realized that his staff did really deserve to be recognized.
During a presentation, he publicly thanked people for fostering a collaborative spirit on the project. He later realized that what he had done established a human connection with his colleagues that had not been there before. After that, communication was more open among his staff and he felt less guarded and people responded with a new level of enthusiasm for his leadership.
People like to be recognized in different ways high fives, thank you notes, certificates, free movie tickets, and so many others. Its great to figure out what makes people tick and what really makes them feel valued. At the very least though, say thank you and acknowledge the good things people are doing. It will make a difference. Show people with both words and actions that you appreciate them.
As part of encouraging the heart, the authors of The Leadership Challenge identify two commitments:
Recognize contributions by showing appreciation for individual excellence.
Celebrate the values and victories by creating a spirit of community.
Think about a time when someone showed appreciation to you in a way that was meaningful. Regardless of whether it was a grand gesture or a simple handwritten thank you note, you were reminded that you matter. Good leaders personalize recognition rather than going with a one-size-fits-all approach. They take time to get to know folks personally and thus can be genuine in how they recognize accomplishments.
Leaders have a knack for bringing people together and fostering a sense of community. They realize the importance of creating teams with shared values and mutual respect. They check their egos at the door, and their motto is if it is to be, it is up to we, not me.
Challenge these Questions:
How do I show gratitude to those who matter most to me
In what ways do I encourage my family, friends, and colleagues to be the best they can be
Do I show my passion and compassion in all that I say, think, and do
How do I create community, promote teamwork, and celebrate accomplishments with those I lead
Avoid these
Time after time research reveals that the primary reason employees give for leaving an organization is limited praise and recognition. For most people it is most important to feel valued and appreciated. However, most leaders believe that salary, job security, and advancement opportunities are most valued by their employees. As a result, little consideration is given to daily recognition. Ironically, when leaders themselves have been asked what is most important to them they too ranked being appreciated, informed, and listened to as most important.
For some reason, many leaders are uncomfortable with the thought of encouraging the heart seeing it as too soft or wimpy. In many organisations, the mere mention of this topic results in laughs and discomfort. Perhaps we have become so used to not receiving recognition and care in the workplace that weve lost sight of its importance. Or perhaps we are still uncomfortable talking about our feelings in the workplace. Yet evidence reveals that our feelings are important, regardless of our level in the organization.
Techniques
Following are some techniques to assist leaders when encouraging the Heart:
Set Clear Standards
It is critical that recognition revolves around valued behaviour within the organization; appreciating those individuals who have demonstrated stellar performance based on clear expectations. When this element is apparent, recognition becomes an opportunity to reiterate what is valued; while reminding people how important they are to the organization.
Expect the Best
There is an old saying: we get what we expect. When leaders assume incompetence is all around them, that is exactly what they will find. Alternatively, when leaders expect greatness, it will surely show up. Many of you may be familiar with the Pygmalion Effect, a theory which states that even if the employee does not believe in themselves initially, when others show their belief in them, the employees confidence will rise. People have a tendency to live up or down to your expectations as a leader.
Pay Attention
Far too often, leaders spend their time in the field identifying problems and coaching to opportunities. When this occurs, the number of missed opportunities for catching people doing things well is immeasurable. Kouzes and Posner take a familiar concept of MBWA (Management by Walking Around) to a new level in what they refer to as CBWA (Caring by Walking Around); a very important one-word difference. Effective leaders not only notice what employees are doing well but recognize the significance of their actions.
Personalize Recognition
The most effective leaders know what is important to each individual and customize their recognition to be most meaningful to the person. When the recognition is in direct alignment with the individuals values and priorities, even the smallest token can have tremendous impact. In my experience, I have seen organizations put a lot of money into recognition programs, yet when the delivery is impersonal it completely diminishes the value of the investment.
Celebrate Together
As we continue to move into a virtual business world through e-mails, teleconferences, and cell phones, social support is not as prevalent as it once was in the workplace. Public ceremonies not only provide a forum for reiterating standards and values, but they also give people an opportunity to come together and become closer. I continually hear people say one of the primary reasons they come to work is because of the people they work with. Yet, we often dont provide the needed opportunities to nurture this desire for social interaction. In fact, many leaders view public celebrations as wasteful with so much work that needs to get done, while overlooking the important fact that satisfied employees are productive employees.
Set the Example
Leaders must model expected behaviour. In order to create a culture of celebration, the leader must go first. As a leader, it is critical to walk around and get to know the people, inquire on what is important to each individual and take note of what they are doing. This is not an easy practice, it takes diligence and effort to establish clear standards and then support others in achieving them. As Kouzes and Posner state, When leaders do get personally involved in encouraging the heart, the results are always the same: the receiver and the giver both feel uplifted. The reflection in the mirror is the one you portray.
Create the conditions for success
Controlling leaders have low credibility. Inspecting, correcting, and checking up on people signal a lack of trust. Create an atmosphere of trust and confidence to show that you fully believe that the outcome will be the best and that you are not constantly worrying that the worst will happen.
Post Note
In few workshops this writer had facilitated, it was noticed that many managers and leaders really do not usually show appreciation nor give recognition to what their teams, especially individual staff, have accomplished and contributed to achieving the standards
Some reasons given by managers and leaders for not giving credit where credit is due include, theyre just doing their job, we may be seen as playing favourites, and they may think we are not sincere.
Whatever, the reasons one may have, it is necessary for the managers to reflect on their most memorable recognition received and given, do a self-assessment of their current practices against the Encouragement Index, and then create an action plan for building up the use of the seven essentials. That is the only way the managers themselves can reach the aspirations set for themselves by the higher management.

Trump threatens with tariffs on European cars
US President Donald Trump has once more attacked the EU over trade barriers and threatened to slap a tax on imports of European cars. His comments come amid fears of a trade war over new US steel and aluminum tariffs.
US President Donald Trump has upped the ante in an ongoing row over trade tariffs, saying that if the European Union did not lower its trade barriers on US products, he would consider introducing import tariffs for European cars, adding, "We're gonna tax Mercedes-Benz, we're gonna tax BMW."
Trump said on Twitter that the EU had objected to plan new import tariffs on steel and aluminum while itself imposing "horrific" trade barriers on US products.
Such import taxes on cars would be especially problematic for Germany, a German foreign trade expert said on Sunday.
"Tariffs on cars would have very different consequences for Germany than tariffs on steel," Gabriel Felbermayr of the Munich-based ifo economic institute told the Sunday edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.

US $ 100 mn Indian Line of Credit for solar projects in Sri Lanka
An Indian Line of Credit for US $ 100 million was announced for undertaking solar projects in Sri Lanka, which includes development of 200, 000 rooftop solar units for low income families (for US$ 50 million) and setting up of rooftop solar in Government schools and colleges, hospitals and other Government establishments in Sri Lanka (for US $ 50 million), during President Maithripala Sirisena's visit to India, the Indian High Commission in Colombo said.
President Sirisena visited New Delhi from March 10-11 to attend the Founding Conference of the International Solar Alliance. The Founding Conference was co-chaired by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron.
President Sirisena called on Indian President Ram Nath Kovind and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the conference. He also attended the Presidential banquet hosted in Rashtrapati Bhawan on March 10 and lunch hosted by the Prime Minister on March 11 for the delegates.
The ISA Founding Conference brought together delegations from 46 countries including Heads of State and Government from 21 countries. Several UN representatives, leaders of Multilateral Development Banks, business leaders in renewable energy, members of civil society and think tanks also attended the conference. The Delhi Solar agenda was released at the conference.
Solar projects worth nearly US$ 1.4 billion in 15 countries were announced at the conference under Government of India concessional financing.
The ISA has been described by the Indian Prime Minister as the single most important global achievement after the Paris Accord on Climate Change. The first General Assembly of the ISA is expected to be held on the sidelines of the second edition of the Renewable Energy Global Investors Meet and Expo, in short REINVEST to be organized by the New and Renewable Energy Ministry of India in April.
India has offered to meet ISA Secretariat expenses for the initial five years. The Indian Government has allotted five acres of land to ISA, a campus in Gurugram, Haryana and released US$ 20 million for creating a corpus fund, building infrastructure and meeting day to day recurring expenditure. President Maithripala Sirisena attended the launch of ISA at the COP-21 in Paris on November 30, 2015. The ISA was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the then French President Francois Hollande.
The ISA is conceived as a coalition of 121 solar resource-rich countries (lying fully or partially between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn) to address their energy needs, through a common platform for collaboration, for achieving speed, scale and skills for deploying available solar technologies; facilitating strategic and collaborative solar R&D; and lowering the cost of finance for solar projects and capacity building.
A total of 62 countries have joined the ISA so far, out of which 32 countries have signed and ratified the ISA Framework Agreement. Sri Lanka became a full-fledged member of the ISA on February 12.

Vision 2025 reforms vital for rapid, inclusive growth - IMF
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) opines that the reforms under the authorities Vision 2025 are important in promoting rapid and inclusive growth. Sri Lankas protectionist trade regime should be gradually liberalized through reform of tariffs, para-tariffs, and non-tariff barriers, as well as closer regional integration.
This was subsequent to the IMF Staff Concluding their 2018 Article IV Mission with Sri Lanka.
The mission met with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne, State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs Dr Harsha De Silva, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Indrajit Coomaraswamy, other public officials, and representatives of the business community, civil society and international partners. Robust implementation of the new IRA and the one-stop shop for FDI will improve the investment climate. Efforts to combat corruption should be stepped up, including through greater transparency in fiscal and SOE management and a stronger AML, CFT regime. Addressing Sri Lankas sizable gender gap and boosting female labor force participation will require labor market reforms and effective gender budgeting, including through vocational training, flexible work arrangements, safe transportation, and child care support.

War, conflict fuel arms imports to Middle East, Asia
SWEDEN: Weapons imports to the Middle East and Asia have boomed over the past five years, fuelled by war and tensions in those regions, a new study showed on Monday.
In the period between 2013 and 2017, arms imports to the conflict-ridden Middle East more than doubled, jumping by 103 percent compared with the previous five-year period, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) calculated.
And the Middle East accounted for 32 percent of all arms imports worldwide.
SIPRI, an independent institute, monitors arms deliveries by volume over periods of five years in order to iron out short-term fluctuations.
Saudi Arabia -- which is waging a war against Shiite Houthi rebels backed by its regional rival Iran -- is the world's second largest importer of arms after India, SIPRI said.
The United States accounts for 61 percent of arms imports to Saudi Arabia and Britain for 23 percent.
On Friday, Britain signed a preliminary multi-billion-pound order from Saudi Arabia for 48 Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets, military equipment maker BAE Systems announced.
The deal sparked heated debate and protests in the UK where the NGO, Save the Children, placed a life-size statue of a child near parliament to draw attention to the violence that is being fuelled, in part, by British-made bombs. Widespread violent conflict in the Middle East and concerns about human rights have led to political debate in Western Europe and North America about restricting arms sales, said senior SIPRI researcher Pieter Wezeman.
Yet the US and European states remain the main arms exporters to the region and supplied over 98 percent of weapons imported by Saudi Arabia.
Nevertheless, Asia and Oceania was the biggest region for arms imports, accounting for 42 percent of the global total between 2013 and 2017, the institute calculated.
And India was the world's largest weapons importer, with Russia its main supplier accounting for 62 percent of its imports.
At the same time, arms deliveries to India from the US, the world's top weapons exporter, increased more than six-fold in the five-year period, SIPRI calculated.
The tensions between India, on the one side, and Pakistan and China, on the other, are fuelling India's growing demand for major weapons, which it remains unable to produce itself, another SIPRI researcher Siemon Wezeman said.
China, by contrast, is becoming increasingly capable of producing its own weapons and continues to strengthen its relations with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar through arms supplies, he added.
Beijing, whose weapons exports rose by 38 percent in the five-year period, is the main arms supplier for Myanmar, accounting for 68 percent of imports.
It also accounted for 71 percent of weapons imports to Bangladesh and for 70 percent of imports to India's nuclear-armed rival, Pakistan.
Myanmar's violence against the Rohingya Muslim minority has caused some 700,000 of the people to flee over the border to Bangladesh since August, taking with them horrifying testimony of murder, rape and arson by soldiers and vigilante mobs.
The atrocities have triggered international condemnations, including EU and US sanctions, against Myanmar.

A wild elephant had recently entered the Karaitivu Agrarian Services Centre premises and damaged the centre's parapet wall and crops.
Elephants have found their way into villages of the Addalaichenai, Akkaraipattu, Karaitivu, Sammanthurai, Irakkamam, Alayadivembu, Thirukkovil and Pottuvil Divisional Secretariat areas in the Ampara district.
Wild elephants have damaged paddy fields, other crops and home gardens and as a result, the livelihood of the public is affected.
Parents complained that the education of their children was also affected due to this prevalent situation. Villagers urge the authorities responsible to set up an electric fence in order to prevent wild elephants from entering their villages.
