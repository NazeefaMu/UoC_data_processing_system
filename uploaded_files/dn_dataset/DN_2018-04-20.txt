Ampara, Kandy incidents reversed development
Unfortunate incidents occurred in Ampara and Kandy recently reversed the country and its economy while gaining international disrepute, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday said.
He was addressing the Parliamentary Committee Meeting on ensuring communal and religious harmony in Sri Lanka attended by religious leaders.
The meeting was held at the parliamentary complex and in his welcome address, the Speaker said the committee will focus on many challenges the country face.
Our first goal is resolve the national issues we are facing today. It is a crime to allow them to affect our future generations. We have made an appeal to all state leaders, former leaders and opposition leaders. If we fail to resolve these issues and hand over the country to our future generations, it is a grave injustice, Speaker Jayasuriya said.
The speaker noted that the main objective of the committee is to foster unity among all races and religions of the country. A country that is divided is bound to perish and has no future. Every country that has developed has gained stability through national unity. We need to create a disciplined country. A downfall of Sri Lankans lies in their failure to work on time. If the leaders learn to work on time, the rest of the country will follow,the speaker said.

Govt. plans to attain 30-MW power grid by 2020
The government had planned to establish a self-sufficient, 30-MW national power grid by 2020, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He was addressing the inaugural ceremony of the Sulanbala Meheyuma that was held at the Hambantota Solar Power Station, recently.
Accordingly, it had been planned to meet 20 percent of the countrys power output by 2020 and to expand it to 50 percent by 2030 under the programme, he added.
The Ceylon Electricity Board, Lanka Electricity Company and the Sustainable Energy Authority, is currently implementing the Sooryabala Sangramaya programme related to solar power generation, the minister said, adding that where Sri Lankas geographical positioning was concerned, it bore the potential for wind power.
A 128-MW power output could be achieved through large-scale plants, he said.
The hill country and most coastal areas have been identified as areas with high wind potential and the Sustainable Energy Authority has taken measures to implement a pilot project with the use of 1-kW and 2-kW turbines at the Hambantota Solar Power Station, he added.
He said that although there was an abundance of wind energy within the hill country, utilising it had proven to be difficult due to infrastructural restrictions.
However, through the programme, medium-scale wind turbines of around a 150-kW capacity would be introduced.

America mourns Barbara Bush
US: Former President George H.W. Bush thanked fellow Americans on Wednesday for their outpouring of love following the loss of his wife of seven decades, Barbara, saying the tributes flowing in for the one-time First Lady were lifting us all up. Long seen as the pillar of one of Americas most prominent families, as wife to the 41st US president and mother to the 43rd, Barbara Bush died Tuesday at her home in Texas aged 92, surrounded by her family.
Her 93-year-old husband, who was at her side until the end, holding her hand, was said to be heart-broken at the loss of his beloved Barbara. But on Wednesday the ex-commander-in-chief struck a resolutely stoical tone.
I always knew Barbara as the most beloved woman in the world, he wrote in a statement. In fact I used to tease her that I had a complex about that fact. But the truth is the outpouring of love and friendship being directed at The Enforcer is lifting us all up, he said, using a fond nickname coined by the Bush clan for their matriarch.
We know life will go on -- as she would have it, he added. So cross the Bushes off your worry list. Known for her trademark faux pearls and tart-tongued comments about life in and out of Washington -- but also her deep loyalty to family and self-deprecating humor -- Barbara Bush was in many ways a figure more popular among ordinary Americans than her high-flying husband and sons.
President Donald Trump lent his voice to the chorus celebrating a departed national treasure.
For decades Barbara was a titan in American life, and a tireless champion for literacy, he told a press conference in Florida.
Her presence and character were engraved into Americas identity. Her strength and toughness really embodied the spirit of our country, Trump said, speaking alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who also offered his countrys heartfelt condolences. Having undergone heart surgery in 2009, Bush was treated for years for Graves disease, a thyroid condition. As her health failed in recent days, she was moved into comfort care at her home in Houston.
Son George W. Bush, who won the White House eight years after his father left it, told Fox Business that he took solace from her soul being comforted on her deathbed. Its the end of a beautiful life, he said.
Barbara Bush is survived by five children, 17 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. She lost a sixth child -- daughter Robin -- to leukemia as a toddler.
She will be laid to rest in Texas after a memorial ceremony Saturday in Houston, to be attended by First Lady Melania Trump, former president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle, and the former Vice president Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne.
Former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary were also reportedly due to attend. Trump ordered flags to fly at half-staff at all public buildings and military posts in Bushs honor.
Tributes poured in from across the political spectrum, including from the Obamas who voiced gratitude to Mrs Bush for the generosity she showed to us throughout our time in the White House. But were even more grateful for the way she lived her life -- as a testament to the fact that public service is an important and noble calling; as an example of the humility and decency that reflects the very best of the American spirit. Bill Clinton, who succeeded Bushs husband in office, described her as a remarkable woman who brought together grit and grace, brains and beauty. She showed us what an honest, vibrant, full life looks like. Barbara met her husband-to-be at age 16 when she was a schoolgirl and he was a student at an elite Massachusetts preparatory school. They married in 1945 while he was on leave from wartime service.
She made history as one of just two women to be wife and mother to two US presidents. Abigail Adams, who died in 1818, was the other.
Her son Jeb, a two-term Florida governor who also ran for president, hailed the exceptionally gracious, gregarious, fun, funny, loving, tough, smart, graceful woman who was the force of nature known as Barbara Bush. Barbara Bush was her husbands companion and advisor, traveling the world as he rose from Texas oilman to congressman, US ambassador to China, director of the CIA and eventually to the vice presidency and the White House.
But she avoided direct involvement in politics, and the posturing that comes with it -- gaining a reputation for toughness, wry humor and straight-speaking.
Im not running for president; George Bush is, she said at the 1988 Republican National Convention. What you see with me is what you get.  - AFP

Anuradhapura district prepares for Yala season
Around 78,514 hectares of paddy will be cultivated in the Yala season, said Anuradhapura Government Agent RM Wanninayake. According to the decisionstaken at the kanna meeting, the fields not cultivated with paddy will be used to grow additional food crops due to the scarcity of water.
The fertilizer subsidy will not be paid in cash; instead farmers could buy their fertilizer requirements from the 42 agrarian development centres in the Anuradhapura district. A 50 kg bag of fertilizer is sold at Rs. 500 which is a subsidised price. A farmer could buy urea, TSP, or MOP fertilizer under this programme on the recommendations of the agriculture research and production assistants. The government pays an enhanced price to buy fertilizer in order to offer the fertilizer at the subsidised rate of Rs. 500 per bag. It costs the government Rs. 3,400 per bag of urea, Rs. 3,300 per bag of MOP and Rs. 3,800 for one bag of TSP.
Farmers could purchase extra fertilizer from the open market at the rate of Rs. 1,500 per bag, which is also a subsidised price, Wanninayake emphasised further. He said that it has been estimated that 16,140 metric tons of urea, 3,919 mt of TSP and 4,314 mt of MOP are required during Yala 2018 in the Anuradhapura district.
The total commercial value of this consignment of fertilizer is Rs. 1,680 million. Anuradhapura fertilizer secretariat's assistant director Ajith Kumara said there are storage facilities for around 30,000 metric tons in Seeppukulama, Galenbindunuwewa, Negama, Nochchiyagama, Horowpothana, Medawachchiya and Kiralogama.
Speaking about the fertilizer subsidy paid in cash during the last two years, Kumara said that in Maha season 2016/17 for cultivating 50,665 hectares, Rs. 634 million was paid to 70,993 farmers and during 2017/18 Maha season, fertilizer subsidy worth Rs. 965 million was paid to 77,177 farmers.
He said further in Yala 2017 for 24,639 farmers, for cultivating 35,344 hectares, Rs. 313 million was paid in cash as the fertilizer subsidy.

Ashok Leyland plans a capex of INR.1,000 crore and expansion of product range this fiscal as the countrys second largest medium and heavy commercial vehicle (M&HCV) company gears up for the upcoming growth curve.
The company ended 2017-18 with its highest-ever medium and heavy duty truck volume of more than a lakh units and maintained its market share at 33 per cent despite intense competition.
The Hinduja flagship expects the growth momentum in the M&HCV (goods) segment to continue till 2020 due to favourable growth drivers.
I think the market is very bullish and the next couple of years look strong. This year outlook is bright due to infrastructure push and year after that will be BS VI pre-buy period. And year after that, normally you expect the demand to moderate. But that is the year scrappage policy will kick in. So, the overall demand outlook is favourable, Vinod Dasari, Managing Director, Ashok Leyland, said at the companys global conference event here.
He said the capex for the current fiscal would be about INR..1,000 crore, which will be invested in expanding capacity and capabilities as also in new product development. The proposed capex is the highest in the recent years.
The company will be debottlenecking all its plants to solve the capacity constraints, which arose due to rise in demand for tippers and other vehicles.
Dasari also said the shift towards the higher tonnage vehicles in the market helped secure better margins and the companys revenues will be more than INR.25,000 crore for FY18 against 20,000 crore in the previous year. But, we will continue to focus on generating double-digit operating margins, he added.

Assault on Dutch tourist, Mirissa
The recent report in the British newspaper The Daily Mirror, Dutch tourist assaulted in Sri Lanka, brings home to me the reality of living in Sri Lanka.
I have lived in Unawatuna for six years, managing a successful beach resort and on a daily basis I am personally subject to harassment, bullying, intimidation, constant leering and sheer rudeness. This treatment comes from my neighbours but also from government institutions and officers of the law.
Despite highlighting and complaining about these issues to government bodies, it appears that as a foreign woman I have to accept this. And it seems to be an unsaid and unwritten rule that the very worse thing I can do is to say anything. Put up and shut up if you want to live in this country, seems to be the message.
This is a particularly sad state of affairs for me as I am half Sri Lankan; I have been regularly coming to Sri Lanka since 1969 and have strong family roots all over the island. And now I live here. It seems that because of the colour of my skin I am not worthy of my birthright.
So reading with utter dismay what a group of hapless tourists have experienced recently in Mirissa, is truly shocking. And worse, I know that despite the extreme damage that this report will do to an already fragile tourist industry in this country, nothing will change and government institutions and those invested with the power to act will smile the problem away and go to lunch.
Tourist industry
Of course, dreadful things happen to tourists all over the world but for a country that is trying to develop its tourist industry and trades on the smile and the friendliness, the law, state sponsored religion and the government must take action now against the ingrained culture of disrespect to white women.
And this culture of disrespect is not confined to beach boys and tuk tuk drivers; the male population as a collective seems not to reflect the values it assigns to Sri Lankan women, to white women.
A white woman is not seen as a mother, sister, aunt, wife girlfriend or a woman happy to be on her own. First and foremost she is objectified, judged, despised and abused.
Elected governments
The Sri Lankan male collective views the white woman as up for it and desperate for indiscriminate sex.
The purveyors of moral guidance that proliferate around this island in every town and village; who provide spiritual sustenance for a nation struggling to balance progress with tradition, has to step up and take action where vested interests of elected governments have failed.
Sri Lankans must wake up and dismantle the perpetual ingrained cycle of turning a blind eye to these terrible events.

Britain to broaden assistance to Sri Lanka- Liam Fox
Britain is ready to invest FDIs in Sri Lanka and assistance to the country will be further broadened with necessary programmes duly implemented in the near future, British State Secretary for International Trade Liam Fox said.
President Maithripala Sirisena who is currently on a visit to London to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) 2018 met Fox on Wednesday evening.
The President discussed at length, ways in which bilateral trade between the two countries could be further strengthened and opportunities for new investments could be found.
Fox explained to the President that they would also take the step of including the opportunities for investment in Sri Lanka on the official website of the British Ministry of International Trade. President Sirisena informed Fox that there has been a great increase in FDIs into the country and that sectors such as tourism have shown special progress.
The Sri Lankan governments foreign policy of being friends to all nations has allowed them to win many a victory on behalf of the motherland, President Sirisena said.
The President further noted that the government has paid special attention to investments in the electricity generation sector with special prominence also being given to the agriculture and livestock sectors.
He thanked the British government for their support in the development of Sri Lanka.
President Sirisena also took the opportunity to meet British Parliamentarian Lord Naseby who has on several occasions spoken on behalf of Sri Lanka in the UK Parliament.
Lord Naseby commended the governments development programme and assured the President that he would lend his wholehearted support to the country. He also took the opportunity to appreciate the reconciliation programme in the country and stated that Sri Lanka was on a much better path compared to other post war countries.
Lord Naseby further noted that it was unfortunate that the real information on the ground realities of the country was not being received by European countries and Geneva. He said he will do his utmost to deliver the truth to them.
The President thanked Lord Naseby for his personal efforts in communicating the realities of the country to the world.

Cargills Bank to  be listed by 2020
Cargills Bank in its third year of operations posted a Profit Before Tax of Rs. 621 million which included a substantial one-off gain of Rs. 410 million.
Cargills Bank has also got regulatory approval to operate banking counters at all its Food City supermarkets island wide, helping it keep costs low. The bank is also looking to be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange by 2020.
The Banks Net Interest Income increased 55% to reach Rs. 1.48 billion, whilst net fee and commission income increased by 43% to Rs. 114 million during the year, with other sources of income (excluding the gain from disposal of its subsidiary) growing by 109% to Rs. 121 million at year-end.
These revenue increases saw the Banks total operating income growing substantially from its previous level to Rs. 2.2 billion for the year, enabling it to achieve a Profit Before Tax of Rs. 211 million (when the net gain of Rs 410 million from disposal of its subsidiary is excluded).
It is heartening that the contribution to this performance came from growth in activity across all core segments of the Bank supported by synergies from its strong association with the Cargills Group.
Total loans and advances of the Bank increased by 55% to reach Rs. 20.8 billion whilst deposit portfolio doubled from Rs. 9.4 billion to Rs. 18.8 billion during the year.
The CASA mix stood at 22% at year end. Total asset base of the Bank stood at Rs. 32.5 billion as at end of 2017.

## Title: Cash crunch, more of  a structural issue

Cash crunch, more of  a structural issue
Despite the constant assurances of the Centre and the RBI that there is more than adequate currency in circulation to meet the demand and that the cash crunch is only temporary, owing to a sudden spike in demand, the numbers reveal otherwise.
In fact, a glance at how the levels of currency in circulation have moved in the past decade, the composition of banknotes and daily cash demand, clearly indicated a cash crunch in the offing. It is unclear how the RBI could have missed these signals and have been caught by surprise. Let us consider the currency in circulation first. True, currency in circulation is now at 18.4 lakh crore, higher than the 17.6 lakh crore in November 2016 before demonetisation. But comparing absolute numbers in isolation, without taking into account the underlying growth in the economy, could be misleading.
Currency in circulation
A look at the data from 2007 shows that the currency in circulation grew by 14 per cent annually (compounded annual growth) until March 2016. The notes in circulation were 11-12 per cent of the nominal GDP. Considering both the pace of economic activity and the general growth in currency notes, a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the currency in circulation should have been at least 21-lakh crore.
The 3-4 lakh crore shortfall in supply of currency is causing the cash crunch at a time when demand is high (a known phenomenon this time of the year). Cash withdrawals are now 14-15 per cent of the currency in circulation, up from 12-13 per cent a few years back. The trend in cash withdrawal also shows that pinning hopes on digital transactions to plug the shortfall in supply of currency may have been overdone by the Centre and the RBI. Usage of debit/credit cards
After shooting up in December 2016 due to demonetisation, the usage of debit and credit cards for purchases has been healthy, but not strong enough to signal a major shift away from cash. Debit cards usage at PoS, which had shot up to 58,000 crore in value in December 2016, has since been hovering at far lower levels of 36,000-40,000 crore per month.
Debit card usage at PoS is still just 13 per cent of the total debit card transactions; the usage at PoS had shot up to 40 per cent in December 2016 post demonetisation.
Some reports have also suggested that the hoarding of 2,000 notes has led to the cash crunch.
This could well be, given that these notes constitute half of the total banknotes in circulation in value as of March 2017.
As of March 2016, the share of 500 and above banknotes, together accounted for 86.4 per cent of the total value of banknotes in circulation.
As of March 2017, 500 notes constitute only 22 per cent of the total bank notes in circulation.

The bionic man
The frequent replacement of the original with the artificial has made Prince Philip a bionic man. At the age of 97 he has entered hospital to replace the hip bone. But he is more known for his cutting wit than his artificial limbs.
He came to Sri Lanka at the invitation of the Institution of Engineers to declare open the brand new headquarters. The gallery was packed with graduates and students. Pointing to a fallen pot of flowers Prince Phillip remarked that he hopes our engineering is not like that.
His cutting, withering, whimsical barbs are no respecter of persons. The Queen herself has been the target. In Belize in 1994 when the Queen was chatting to her hosts on the quayside, he shouted at her from the deck of Britannia Yak, yak, yak, come on get a move on.
Here a few more examples of his numerous gaffes.
* I declare this open whatever it is, he remarked on a visit to Canada in 1969.
* They must be out of their minds, in the Solomon Islands in 1982 when he was told that the annual population growth was 5%.
* If you stay here much longer you will all be slitty eyed, to British students in China during the 1986 state visit.

Commonwealth Games medal winners felicitated
Sports could be a diplomatic bridge to build peace, unity and brotherhood among our communities in Sri Lanka acting Minister of Sports Faizer Mustapha said at a felicitation ceremony held at Duncan White Auditorium yesterday for the Sri Lankan athletes who excelled at the recently concluded Commonwealth Games.
Whilst pointing out that his appointment as acting Sports Minister was not permanent Mustapha said that it is the duty of the government to felicitate our national assets who excelled at the Commonwealth Games.
I discussed this with former Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara and decided to organize this ceremony, said Mustapha.
We never won a single medal at the last Commonwealth Games but with support from the Ministry of Sports and the National Federations immense contribution we won six medals, he said.
Mustapha, the Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister was last week appointed as acting Sports Minister after Dayasiri Jayasekara resigned from his portfolio. Jayasekara who also graced the occasion thanked Mustapha for inviting him to the felicitation and said, I thank all the participants who competed for honor at the Commonwealth Games. After 80 years we have won the highest number of medals. During my tenure we have done our best and so far concluded all the sports national federations elections including the National Olympic Council. Only two or three federations have to hold their elections out of the 60 national sports federations. Jayasekara further said that the amendments to the Sports Law were in the final stages and he hoped the present Minister will complete it. The athletes were felicitated with cash reward letters and Minister Mustapha promised the athletes that they will be further rewarded by President Maithripala Sirisena as well.
According to the Minister of Sports Rs. 4 million was allocated for winning the Silver medal and Rs. 3 million for Bronze.
Weightlifter Indika Dissanayake won the Silver and the Bronze medal winners were Chaturanga Lakmal and Dinusha Gomes (both weightlifting) and, Anusha Kodituwakku, Thivanka Ranasinghe and Vidanalange Bandara (all boxing).
Sri Lanka was placed 31st in the medals table at the 21st Commonwealth Games that was held at Gold Coast, Australia with a total medals tally of six which consisted of one silver and five bronze medals. This was the highest number of medals the country has accumulated at the Commonwealth Games.

Ive got tickets for the IPL matches, want to come Bob a friend of mine asks.
You crazy I ask him, Ive got my old TV and cant find a better place to sit and watch the game! Where else can you watch 18 balls being bowled per over
Theres only six balls Bob!
On my TV I get two action replays for every ball bowled! I reply condescendingly.
Where else but on idiot box would camera man focus on pretty, overdressed, self conscious wives on stands and cheerleaders in bikinis instead of on some tired bowler bowling to an equally tired, exhausted batsman
Where else, but in front of my TV, can I sit in the comfort of my bedroom with AC going full blast and pity poor spectators sweating it out on steaming stands, not sure whether the sun is going to get hotter or the promised sea breeze arriving after the match!
Where but in front of my TV, can I cheer for a Pakistani batsman without being branded as unpatriotic and Modi and his government dragging me to jail on charges of sedition
Give me my idiot box for a seat on the stands, where with myopic eyes I will try and squint to see whether batsman has already arrived at crease, clap wildly for six only to be told that what I saw was not the ball, but an aircraft landing. Where I will wave wildly at man selling popcorn who will deftly and cleverly evade my glances, my shouts, my frantic waving and will come my way empty handed after selling his wares to other luckier more agile souls, while those by my side wonder if Ive come to eat or cheer their home team! Whereas in bedroom with TV blaring I with calm relaxed movement move right arm in direction of my box of cashew, left arm for hot samosa and clap gently to the wife for another and another and another cup of tea.
And then with all the excitement I need to find the cloakroom.
I look at stands and wonder where it is Has one to hold ones breath and bladder and wait for the end of match, then be crushed in a stampede to the john, or like a king walk in regal splendor from bedroom to bathroom and back as many times as I want
Ah the freedom my TV gives, I can visit between overs, the cloak, the kitchen, my study, look out of window, even switch channels! Can one dream of such luxury when sitting in a cricket stadium watching sometimes agonizing maiden over bowled, with batsman going block, block, block!
But here in front of my TV, I switch, yes switch from cricket to a Netflix or Amazon movie and watch my favorite actor dodge a hundred bullets while on cricket field the batsmen run a tired single..!

Diaz-Canel was elected in a landmark vote of the National Assembly a day before his 58th birthday.
The chamber erupted into applause as the results were read out, with many of the delegates smiling, and shaking hands warmly with Castro and Diaz-Canel.
As Diaz-Canel walked to the front of the chamber, he high-fived the front line of delegates, embracing Castro as he took to the stage, images broadcast on state television showed.
Then the 86-year-old Castro raised his successors arm in the air in victory, prompting another wave of applause from the delegates -- some were in their shirt sleeves, while others wore military fatigues.Diaz-Canel, who has spent years climbing the party ranks, was named the sole candidate for the presidency on Wednesday.

Dr. THURAIRAJA the maharaja of many sports
It goes like the saying finding a needle in a haystack. This axiom refers to none other than that sportsman of many parts to come out of the school at Reid Avenue ROYAL COLLEGE that produced not only illustrious academics, but all round sportsmen who dont come that easy these days.
The 1960s, 1970s and 80s were the decade that popped a sportsman who had no equal in that era. It is a belief of some that sports and studies rarely click. But in the tall and likeable and unassuming stood out CHELLIAH THURAIRAJA an over 6 feet sporting genius who excelled not only in studies, but sports too. And add to all that he was a Gentleman par excellence.
To school mates at ROYAL and later UNIVERSITY he was a wonder, because while indulging in almost all the sports activities at school he also found the time to show his rare mettle and pass out from school to university from where he finally passed out as a doctor of medicine.
Grew in stature
To mention the spots he figured in school was rugby, cricket, badminton, tennis, basketball, football, athletics and boxing and later as his sporting stature grew he took to golf and becoming a champion came naturally to him.
In school his fellow sportsmen were surprised and unable believe the energy and the stamina he carried. To him success came naturally because he believed to be the best he must play and produce his best, then that success comes and that came naturally to the amazement of all.
THURAIRAJA today is the proud sportsman who has represented the country in four sports rugby, basketball, badminton and golf.
He added the cream to his sporting career by being the only Sri Lankan and South East Asia to sport the countrys colours in two sports basketball and golf.
It is a feat that his school, University and the Sri Lanka Army that he joined and represented later could be proud about and admired as a sporting gift from god.

I got to know THURAIRAJA when I joined the Times of Ceylon in 1961 as a sports reporter with basketball being one of the sports that I was designated to cover for the paper. At that time he was in the University and in that era when basketball was a craze.
As the years rolled by and with schools and clubs sprouting out and with the game played consistently at the various school courts, Police, Army courts and basketball of a high order was the rule.
Names of schools and clubs that come to mind and who contested the many tournaments were Old Bens, Old Petes, Old Joes and clubs Orients BC, Shamrocks and YMCA and the teams from the services Army and Police were outstanding.
Classy performers
In the University his team mates were classy performers in addition to THURAIRAJ were Rasalingam, Sriskandaja, Jesudhasan, Wilson and Ponnabalam.
At that time the Old Bens had some of the finest players the game seen and will never see again especially in Cosmas and Percy Perera.
Percy was such an excellent shooter that he was unanimously voted the Best Shooter in Asia at the Asian Games in Bangkok in 1966 which was great honour to his school and country.
Then there were wonderful players in Matthew George, Rohan de Daluwatte, N. Amaradasa, Sam Lovell, Vijaya Silva, Milroy bde Silva, Edward Sumanasekera, Royden de Silva and Hilary White and may others whose names do not come to mind who took the basketball scene by storm.
Universitys Sportsman of the Year
In the university in the early 1960s he won the University 'Sportsman of the Year' award which was something he still treasures. In addition to his prowess in sport he was a talented 400 metre runner and did the triple jump. THURAIRAJA captained the national basketball team. In school rugby his captain was C.V. Gooneratne who later turned politician. He played in the 1961 Havelocks team that won the Clifford Cup which team was led by Hubert Aloysius. He also played international rugby against the Barbarians when playing for the Defence Services.
THURAIRAJA was very keen on Sports Medicine and during that stay at the wicket he put right sportsmen and women, some of whom suffered career threatening injuries and to the then Sports Minister and sportsman V. A. Sugathadasa that remains the Sports Medicine Unit.
Author of four manuals
Believe it or not THURAIRAJA authored four manuals in sports medicine. One was A text for all doctors who intend qualifying in sports medicine. He was a highly qualified Consultant Radiologist. He enlisted in the Sri Lanka Army Medical Corp in 1961 and rose to be the head of the Medical Corp and Director and then moved to become the Medical Advisor of the Army. He quit as a Major General in 1998.
THURAIRAJA also was Vice President of the Asian Federation of Sport Medicine and an ex.o member of the International Federation of Sports Medicine. While THURAI preferred to go to Royal his brother Chellaraja chose S.Thomas College where he shone with the bat and later he joined the Nondescrpt Cricket Club and scored heavily for them.
Getting wickets for Chellaraj
I had the distinction of playing for a Mercantile team against an Indian club team under Chellaraja's captaincy. I remember when the other bowlers were struggling to get the Indians out, he tossed the ball to me and 'win this game for me' I obliged with wickets. He graciously said to me  Elmo your leg spin/googlies got even the Indians Oogling! 
One other sportsman I remember who excelled in many sports while at St.Benedicts College and was my captain in the 1957 cricket team was LOVELLYN RAYEN who played cricket, hockey, football, athletics, basketball and table tennis. He was a wonder in College.
Sportsmen and academics of the calibre of the soft speaking and like able THURAIRAJA are not born like batsmen making runs, they are god given gifts to the sport. Last year he received a President's award for his excellence and contribution to sport.

effective promotions can increase  gem and jewellery export revenue
Sri Lanka has the potential to increase gem and jewellery export earnings to USD one billion from current earnings of USD 250 million if a proper promotional plan is implemented. However new laws imposed by the Gem and Jewellry Authority (NGJA) are not supportive of the industry, gem and jewellery exporters say.
Exporters are facing issues due to new regulations, industry representatives told at press conference in Colombo this week. Chairman Sri Lanka Gem and Jewellery Association, A. H. M. Imtizam said that the best revenue in gem exports was recorded in 1980 where the industry brought in around US$ 500 million.
Hong Kong earns USD 27 billion from gem and jewellery exports while Thailand earns USD 13 billion per annum. The total global value of the industry is over US$ 100 billion. Sri Lankan Blue sapphire is very much in demand in the world and its brand image alone can drive the local industry to new high.
He, however, said that the industry is now facing issues due to new laws that are being imposed by the Gem and Jewellry Authority (NGJA).
When contacted an official from NGJA said that there are several environmental issues that have being created by the Gem miners and this are why tighter regulations have being brought in. We are not spending funds unnecessary and we have a long term plan to promote the industry, he stressed.
The NGJA, this month has abruptly implemented drastic export charges and cumbersome export procedures which have had the effect of significantly slowing down exports.
The entire industry including the Sri Lanka Gem and Jewellery Association, Lanka Gem Dealers and Miners Association from Ratnapura and the China Fort Gem & Jewellery Traders Association from Beruwela have v opposed these new measures and charges.
With these transaction costs we will never be able to promote locally produced/value added jewellery in the international markets. Sri Lankan Gem exporters revenue is dropping and swift measures should be taken to correct this, he said.
Chairman Sri Lanka Gem Dealers Association, Punsiri Tennakoon said the today 70% of exporters from Sri Lanka is by way of value addition and this is not good for the industrys future.
He said that they also met President Maithripala Sirisena recently to discuss the matter. (SS)

First Ladies Club!
US First Lady Melania Trump looks ready for summer in a $1,100 military-inspired dress as she joins Japanese Prime Minister's wife Akie Abe on tour of a historic mansion in Florida ::Intro
US First Lady Melania Trump toured a marble-bedecked and gold-plated Gilded Age mansion with her Japanese counterpart Akie Abe on Wednesday, amid the Japanese Prime Minister's recent visit to the U.S.
While President Donald Trump and Shinzo Abe golfed at the president's nearby country club, their wives visited Whitehall, a 75-room, 100,000-square-foot waterside retreat in Palm Beach, Florida.
Oil and railroad tycoon Henry Flager built the property as a wedding present for his third wife, Mary Lily Kenan Flagler. The Flaglers wintered there beginning in 1902, and it is now the centerpiece of the Flagler Museum.
Arriving in a motorcade from Mar-a-Lago, the president's own gold-plated mansion three miles away, Melania Trump and Akie Abe were greeted by Flagler's great grandson William Matthews, and museum Executive Director Erin Manning, who led them through a tour of the home, which historians say cost $4 million ($110 million today) to build.
Unlike their husbands, who have a jovial, golf buddy relationship, the first ladies smiled politely, quietly asked Manning questions and walked formally during the parts of their tour visible to the U.S. and Japanese press.
The U.S. first lady wore a $1,100 emerald green dress by Derek Lam and snakeskin designer heels during the visit, while Abe went for a dark dress with a floral print.
Trump kept her hair down in her usual straight style, and also wore her trademark smoky eye and nude lip.
During the Abes' visit to Florida last year, the first ladies visited a Japanese garden. They did not address reporters on Wednesday.
The Japanese first lady caused a bit of a controversy last year when it emerged that President Trump was convinced she didn't speak any English at all.
'So, I was seated next to the wife of Prime Minister Abe, who I think is a terrific guy, and shes a terrific woman but doesnt speak English,' he told the New York Times after a dinner in Germany among G20 leaders.
When reporter Maggie Haberman pushed him, asking: 'Like, nothing, right Like zero' the president answered: 'Like, not "hello."'
But a clip of the Japanese first lady giving a 15-minute keynote speech on a prior occasion promptly surfaced, leading to speculation that Abe had pretended not to speak English so as to avoid speaking with the U.S. president. Others, however, believed that Abe might not be entirely fluent in English and wanted to avoid making mistakes during the dinner. On Wednesday, Manning showed the first ladies the private railroad car Henry Flagler used to travel his Florida East Coast Railway, the line that opened up South Florida as it stretched from Jacksonville to Key West. They were also shown the bicycle-powered white wicker carriages the Flaglers' guests used to traverse the grounds. Flagler also founded Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller. In the mansion's music room, they viewed a portrait of Mary Flagler wearing a long-pearl necklace that Manning says remains the most expensive piece Tiffany has ever created.

Fuel price hike decision with President, PM  Minister
Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga stated that final decision regarding a fuel price hike will be taken by the President and the Prime Minister together.
He made this remarks during the New Year celebration held at Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminal (CPSTL) premises, yesterday.
Government has not finalised whether to maintain CPC and CPSTL as profitable institutions or as institutions which provide service to the public, yet, Minister Ranatunga said. Government has to finalise it soon. Uncertainty of fuel price hike is the most popular topic everywhere. The Finance Ministry is also discussing with us. However, the final decision has to take by the President and Prime Minister together with the Cabinet.
Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Chairman Dammika Ranatunga stated that they were able to take victorious action regardless of barriers within a short period.
We were able to achieve several victories in 10-11 months from the projects which were not initiated for years.
We planned some projects, initiated some and completed the rest. CPC was able to finalise the calling of tenders for the aviation fuel supply project in Katunayake within 45 days. It saves US$ 2 million for the country. We have completed the aviation fuel filtration unit which was recommended by JIG in 2001 within four months. We are also constructing an oil tank terminal in Kolonnawa, Dammika Ranatunga said.

Live a healthier life this new year
Juliet Coombe decides to learn how to cook nourishing vegetarian and vegan dishes at Jetwing Ayurveda Pavilions excellent Herbs and Spices Vegan restaurant, so she can go into the Sri Lankan new year with a healthier outlook.
As I try to order my daily fix a caf latte I am told that the hotel does not serve coffee in any form anymore as it is bad for the absorption of the ayurveda treatments, and an addiction that gives unnatural energy to people like me who is clearly an addict. I am handed a healthy juice of curry leaves instead and start to think after my consultancy with the doctor that perhaps six cups of coffee a day has to end, along with eating meat which puts bad energy in the body and drink a great deal more water.
I am told my life style is way too stressful and I need to relax with a herbal massage and facial, followed by a herbal tea in the tropical garden and a five minute lesson in breathing exercises through my nose. Despite being tired, wishing for my pick me up cup of coffee I am quickly energized by the natural beauty and peace of the place where the staff are preparing for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year. At the entrance to Jetwing Ayurveda Pavilions a giant flower has been created using rice, different colour spices and green grams for decoration, but like everything of great beauty, there is a purpose behind their artistic endevour and this is to keep all the creepy crawlies from entering the house from the newly cut paddy fields by giving them something else to eat.
After a relaxing swim and sleep I am offered a Vegan cooking class by the pool in the most superb surroundings and to the tune of the koha birds ushering in the New Year. My expert chefs kitted me out with a chefs paper hat and some rubber gloves. The array of beautiful colours laid out on the table before me was more like a painters palette than a rich mixture of spices and vegetables, that we picked and washed from the hotel garden.
Even in the balmy heat learning about the medicinal benefits of the plants was fascinating and I was thrilled for my children to join me and learn how to make curry leaf pesto. The boys pulled the leaves off, put a teaspoon of salt, pepper, cut up cashews, garlic, coconut shavings (all of which aids digestion), onions, salt, mango chutney and olive oil in a blender and blasting it for about a minute into the tastiest dip Ive ever eaten and perfect for a vegetable sauce. This pesto I learn from the chef increases digestion and balances Kapha Dosha, which is nothing to do with being a non-believer in mammon, rather it is about balancing stability and structure within those who might be more cold, heavy and dense.
We also made Green Gram White Curry by boiling mung beans and leaving them overnight to soften and soak before adding curry leaves, coconut shavings, curry powder, turmeric (antiseptic), garlic, and onions. This dish is high in protein, cools the body and balances Pitha. However, at the hotel, presentation is as important as food quality and a great deal of love goes into shaping the banana leaves around the meal, often cutting them into fern like semi-garnishers. Each dish is treated like a piece of art, arranging colours and shapes in the most beautiful ways possible.
As we make spinach curry with dahl I learn how each thing we cook has a good or bad effect on our own health. Herbs and Spices restaurant at Jetwing Ayurveda Pavilions is the first hotel in Sri Lanka to be certified by Veggie Hotels for its nourishing gourmet food and the only fully Vegan restaurant in Negombo that focuses entirely on health, while providing an authentic Sri Lankan meal fused with home grown spices and herbs that are picked fresh each day, and better still if your passion is cooking you can book an excellent Ayurveda cooking class, which includes picking the ingredients and learning first hand from the restaurant chef about their medicinal values in both health and an endless array of delicious dishes on their superb ala carte menu, which is available from 11am to 10pm in the evening.

A fantastic oasis with its yoga pavilion, marvellous medical centre, garden suites, and at the other end of this tropical nirvana a superb new wing with fabulous well priced rooms with all the mod cons.

Mokgweetsi Masisi sworn in as Botswanas fifth President
Botswana has once again, witnessed the compliance of the constitutional requirement of a state President relinquishing power at the end of two consecutive five year terms in office.
This was when President Dr. Lieutenant General Seretse Khama Ian Khama stepped down as the 4th President of Botswana on April 1, 2018, after completing ten years as President. He is a son of Sir Seretse Khama, the first President of Botswana. Vice President Mokgweetsi Masisi took his oath before Chief Justice Maruping Dibotelo as 5th President of Botswana.
President Khamas term ended at midnight on March 31, 2018 and Vice President Mokgweetsi Masisi was sworn in as the 5th President of Botswana on April 1, 2018, in the early morning hours amidst rain.
The Attorney General of Botswana Abraham Keetsabe in an exclusive interview to the press, explained that the office of the Presidency, is conferred by operation of Law, is instant and simultaneous and the taking of the oath is a necessary process to allow the new President to start work guided by the oath. The oath being taken later than midnight on March 31, 2018, was not a problem.
The Constitution of Botswana permits a President to hold office only for an aggregate period of ten years, beginning from the date of his or her first assumption of office and the oath taking ceremony signifies the smooth transfer of power from former President Ian Khama to the 5th President Mokgweetsi Masisi. This has been meticulously followed by all previous Presidents who succeeded the first President Sir Seretse Khama, namely President Ketumile Masire (now deceased) and President Festus Gontebanye Mogae.
The down pour was quite heavy and it left all the dignitaries and special guests who were smartly dressed drenched in rain. So were the members of the Botswana Defence Force who were providing a guard of honour to the President who had to be taken under cover of an umbrella to receive it. Rain is always welcome in Botswana. The Setswana word for rain is Pula and the national currency of Botswana is Pula. Such is the importance of rain. It is the general belief in African countries that when a heavy down pour precedes or occurs immediately after an event, like the Presidential swearing in, it is a good omen and that the Gods have smiled upon the man of the moment.
Due to the heavy downpour as a Plan B, the rest of the proceedings took place in the National Assembly (Parliament building) under the stewardship of Speaker Mrs Gladys Kokorwe. The new President made his inauguration address in the National Assembly which is an unicameral legislature. In his speech, he said It is with a deep sense of humility that I accept the immense responsibility that has been bestowed on me and the trust and confidence thereby reposed, as the 5th President of our Republic and Nation of Botswana. In carrying out my duties, my touchstone shall remain the oath I just made to uphold the Constitution, the Rule of Law and maintenance of national unity, peace and prosperity. We remain committed to fighting corruption, in order to safeguard the hopes and dreams of all Batswana for current and future generations. Therefore it is incumbent upon us to continue to strengthen our institutions and exact the full might of the law to ensure the fight against corruption in all its forms and manifestations, he went on to say as follows, Just like my predecessors, I stand to acknowledge that we are not yet where we wish to be as a nation. We still seek to build a Botswana in which sustained development is underpinned by economic diversification. We shall not be satisfied until we have eradicated poverty and social exclusion in order to build a society that provides an opportunity and dignity for all.The new President has excellent credentials. He comes from a strong political dynasty much like that of his predecessor. His father Setlhomo Edison Masisi, was a Member of Parliament and a Cabinet Minister in Sir Seretse Khamas Government; while his late brother, Tshelang Masisi, was the long time MP for Francistown West. His other brother, Brigadier Thulaganyo Masisi is a retired Army General. President Masisi had his early education in the elitist schools in Gaborone, namely Thornhill Primary School and Maru A Pula International School and after graduation, he obtained a Masters degree in Education from Florida State University, U.S.A.
He became a Member of Parliament in October 2009 and was appointed Assistant Minister of Presidential Affairs and Public Administration and in 2011, a full Minister. He has twice won the chairmanship of the Botswana Democratic Party and took over as Vice President from the great Ponatshego Kedikilwe in 2014, when the latter retired as Vice President.
In his new Cabinet, he has appointed Nonofo Molefe his rival in the BDP Chairmanship as the Minister of Presidential Affairs and retained most of the Senior Ministries of his Predecessors Cabinet, while making it a point to remove two ministers against whom there were complaints of alleged corruption, signalling a new era. He has also appointed as his Vice President Slumber Tsogwane, MP for Boteti, the longest serving MP being in Parliament since 1999.
His spouse Mma Neo Jane Atsile is now the First Lady. She is Botswanas 4th First Lady because his predecessor never married. She fills in the 10 year void left by Mma Nametso, wife of the countrys third President Festus Gontebanye Mogae. The First Lady plays a critical role in strengthening the image as well as adding a lot of colour and glamour to the Presidency in the eyes of the people. The First Lady is a feminist and has expounded the Setswana saying, Mosadi thari ya sechaba,  meaning  woman is the Pillar of the Nation and a lot is expected of her.
Botswana has come a long way since the country became independent in 1966. It has an impeccable record of good governance and has a strong economy after the discovery of diamonds. Transparency International has rated Botswana as the least corrupt country in Africa. Although the B.D.P has managed to win all elections up to date, it has faltered in the 2014 General Elections by losing some seats. With the opposition parties seeking to unite under one banner, despite factional conflicts, President Masisi faces the kind of challenges never ever faced by any of his predecessors and he has to read the script and find a winning formula come October 2019.
Judge Mookodi, a lifelong friend of President Masisi and a classmate at both Thornhill and Maru A Pula schools, in a statement to the Mmegi Newspaper has stated that President Masisi is synonymous with certain values which became apparent as he grew up. Honesty is consistant with what he does, quite frank and has a bias for action. There cannot be a better testimonial than this for someone placed in the unenviable position that President Masisi is placed in.
Notwithstanding various negative comments made by his critics, President Masisi has brought hope and joy to many people against all odds and has created great expectations.
Coincidentally, by winning many gold medals at the Commonwealth Games, Botswana athletes led by Amantle Montsho and Isaac Makwala have heralded the arrival of President Mokgweetsi Masisi by decorating him in gold.

More funds for less privileged temples under new move
Five funds under the purview of the Buddha Sasana Ministry, Education Ministry, President's Office,Prime Minister's Office and the Cultural Affairs Ministry will be amalgamated.
Buddhasasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera said this move will ensure the efficient and effective allocation of money to support and develop less privileged temples through a special task force to be established shortly.
Under this programme, temples across the country will be categorized as A,B,C,D and E. A category denotes the most developed temples while the E category denotes the least developed temples.Accordingly, we can identify the less privileged temples and provide financial assistance to upgrade them, he added. There is a close connection between the temple and the village and this connectivity should be improved to uplift moral values as well.
He further said a special meeting with the representatives of all Nikhayas will be held to discuss the current issues affecting Buddhism to be held at the Devagiri Rajamaha Viharaya in Kurunegala on May 1 parallel to the state Vesak festival.There is also a proposal to introduce a medical insurance scheme for Bhikkus which will focus on their health and also provide elderly Bhikkus with an allowance.
"We will also stipulate new quality standards in the production and sale of Atapirikara and robes while sculptures of Buddha statues will be registered to ensure quality and required standards of statues, he said.

Moves against democracy
The Mahinda group do not abandon their racist political project unless Yahapalanaya campaign it out of politics. At every opportunity, they will use the card of racial violence. It is necessary to understand the political thinking of this group to defeat it by the democratic campaign.
The yahapalana unity government as soon as possible brought in the 19th Amendment removing certain powers of the president; in accord with the agreement made with the movement for democracy. It included a constitutional amendment barring an individual from standing for more than two terms, thereby taking the Mahinda out of the next Presidential race.
However, pro-Mahinda pundits indicate a different path of development. They say every enactment has a loophole, and if Mahinda can secure victory at the polls for a proxy candidate, that individual can dissolve Parliament. Then with a massive fascistic campaign, they expect that new Pohottuwa party can secure an overwhelming mandate at the parliamentary polls with a two-thirds majority. Apparently, the way they swept the local body elections some weeks ago indicates such a victory. After that, the newly elected (proxy) President can resign, thereby clearing the way for Mahinda to return to the office he held from 2005 until 2015. They scream that given current trends, that would align with the wishes of the majority of Sri Lankan voters, who are getting disenchanted with the unity government and its lack of strong leadership.
Parliamentary polls
Pro Mahinda group boast that whatever be the shortcomings of Mahinda Rajapaksa, lack of strong leadership is not among them. Apparently, they have set plan to come back; the key is a loyal follower who will resign after dissolving parliament. The loyal individual who resigns his Presidential chair after ensuring Parliamentary polls get held, quitting in favour of Mahinda Rajapaksa, would be made Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, the way the posts of President and Prime Minister were exchanged by Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev in the Russian Federation. Among the possibilities for such a role would be Prof. G.L. Peiris, who has long been a backer of the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Former President Rajapaksa finished off the war against the Lankan state carried on by the LTTE under Velupillai Prabhakaran, who though being a Christian by faith, was considered by the Tamil people as the hero of Hindu Tamil nationalism. During those weeks in 2009, we are told that the BJP under L.K. Advani was giving a sympathetic ear to ally Vaikos admonition to the party to try and save Prabhakaran from final defeat, and the Congress was heeding the call of its allies in Tamil Nadu to make the Lankan military abandon its pursuit of the LTTE. Others say that Congress wanted the head of dead Prabhakaran!
At the same time, pressed by the Norwegians (who were under pressure of human rights organisations of Europe became the protectors of the LTTE within the international community), both the US as well as the EU were raising to a high decibel pitch their commands to Rajapaksa to desist from finishing off the LTTE and its commander. This is the result of the role played by the proletarians of the advanced world. Several times in the past, the Lankan military had reversed its pursuit of the Tamil Tigers in deference to international pressure, thereby saving the lives of Tamil people. This time around, in Mahinda Rajapaksa and his brother Gotabhaya (who as Defence Secretary was having a fascistic hold of the Sri Lankan armed forces), the Lankan state had a pair who refused to play by the rules set by democratic UN charter and ruthlessly condemned the peace efforts of Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe and former President Chandrika Kumaratunga. Not surprisingly, many civilians too (especially the human shields placed in key locations by the LTTE) lost their lives. Since then, all-out efforts of radical Tamil organisations and HR organisations have been launched to ensure that at least a few Lankan generals (present and past) be brought before the International Court of Justice to stand trial for crimes against humanity.
UN resolution
The yahapalanaya unity government in Lanka has gone a considerable distance in exposing the real situation and accepting the demands of the global democratic forces to inquire locally, into the alleged war crimes. Also, Yahapalanaya has agreed to implement the UN resolution. At the same time, UN has recognized that country has been under a fascistic dictatorship since the final defeat of the LTTE in 2009 at the hands of the Sri Lankan military. Under Mahinda regime, Colombo and other towns in the country were at peace but terror continued harming politicians, media personnel and activists for democracy. In the 2015 polls, because of a split in the Sinhala vote between fascistic Mahinda and democratic Ranil Wickremesinghe, Tamil and Muslim minority parties were able to determine who ruled Sri Lanka; Because of the boost in voting percentages among the Tamils and Muslims under democracy to a level unprecedented since the 1970s. Muslim voters turned against Mahinda, because of the expose that he was tacitly backing hard-line Buddhist groups. The present government has the support of only a half of the Sinhala population, relying instead on the near-total backing of the Tamil and Muslim populations on the island. Both of which came out to vote in unprecedented strength during the 2015 polls thus chopping off Mahinda.
Still, the pro-Mahinda group believe, during the next round, Sinhala voters are likely to return to Mahinda, mainly because of a reaction to the consolidation of minority (Tamil and Muslim) peacefully in the country as voters against him! The era of the strongman of Sri Lankan politics seems to be on the rise of return!

Narrative with no holds barred
Book: Impressions: Multifaceted ReflectionsAuthor: Mineka P. Wickramasinghe
In Impressions: Multifaceted Reflections, Mineka P. Wickramasinghe offers his take on the world as hes seen and lived it. His third book, Impressions is a masterful fete of storytelling and reportage, of critical thoughts and imaginative ideas.
As an elder and a statesman who has lived through much of this countrys turmoil, Wickramasinghe has opinions, strong ones. And he makes them known. His writing evidences that he is deeply patriotic, though some readersyounger ones, especially, educated in a different time, viewing the world through a different or perhaps more cynical lensmight question the conclusions his patriotism leads him to.
Still, one thing is for certain: Wickramasinghe is not shy about expressing his views, even when they go against the grain. He does this in his latest book, as he has done throughout his life.
Wickramasinghe is most renowned in the country for being the founder of Ceylon Biscuits Ltd. He started the company as a young man back in 1968, and spent almost 48 years at its helm, guiding it through turbulent times and cementing its status for posterity as one of the most eminent Sri Lankan brands. Under his leadership, Ceylon Biscuits Ltd. expanded its product line dramatically, including developing the Ritzbury line of chocolates in 1991 and acquiring Lanka Soy in 2000. In 2017, he was awarded the Deshamanya title, the nations second-highest national honour given to civilians, for distinguished service of a highly meritorious nature to the nation.
Wickramasinghe retired from CBL nearly three years ago, retaining the position of President Emeritus in the aftermath but allowing himself to spend more time pursuing other passions. One of these passions, according to all who know him, is the written word.
Even as a duly employed Chief Executive Officer of an immense conglomerate, he published two books: The Playmate, a collection of short stories which won the State Literary Prize in the Short Stories category in 1995, and E-Danda, based on the 87-89 insurgency and published in 2010.
Now, his much-awaited third book has finally been released. For anyone invested in the past, present, or future of the countryfor anyone eager to gain personal, the playful, the pious, the professional, or the political insight from one of the countrys most prescient and influential mindsImpressions provides much to chew on.
A significant portion of the book, understandable for a work published at the dusk of his career, is occupied by Wickramasinghes musings on his tenure at Ceylon Biscuits Ltd. In a speech, reprinted in the book, which he delivered to the MBA Alumni Association in 2009, Wickramasinghe provides a brief outline of the history of CBL. In a speech he gave in 2014 at the opening ceremony of Ceylon Biscuits Bangladesh, also reprinted, he writes about how CBL desired to and eventually did expand beyond Sri Lankas borders. He also documents what it takes, in his view, to transform a family business, and the impediments to entrepreneurship of the Indo-Lanka Free Trade Agreement.
The political, too, abounds in Impressions. In Buddhism Endorsed The Tolerance of Our Religion, Wickramasinghe harkens back to the lethal anti-Tamil riots of 1983. Taking a pronouncedly anti-LTTE stance, he writes, The LTTE seized this opportunity as victims of minority oppression and propagated the terrorist cause. They convinced the Western world to take an anti-Sinhala stand, and won sympathy from the Western press, who called the LTTE freedom fighters.
Controversially, Wickramasinghein a treatise on Sinhalese tolerance, which he says stems from a commitment to Buddhist principles, that is the heart of this essaymentions nothing of such discriminatory legislation such as 1956s Sinhala Only Act, which demonstrably led to Tamil discontent.
Instead, he writes, The Sinhalese and Tamils have lived peacefully and worked together in predominantly Sinhala territories, because there was no discrimination. They were free of harassment and equally free to mingle, free to walk with their children, free to dress in their traditional wear, free to come home to the safety of their abode, free to make investments, free to practise their professions and free to criticise the Sinhalese openly. There is no fear psychosis amongst the Tamils in Colombo, or in the Deep South.
This essay, along with the causes and conclusions anointed within it by Wickramasinghe, is sure to be hotly contested and fiercely debated.
Some of the books most pleasant moments come when the author gives himself over to the fantastical and fictional. A short story which particularly delights is The Stranger. Billed as a haunting daunting encounter experience, the story tells of an unidentified man who becomes fixated an older lady he sees walking, sometimes on the streets and sometimes in the woods. No one understands his obsession, least of all himself, but it validates itself slightly when the man sees the women disappear into the cavity of a mango tree.
Wickramasinghe is a storyteller extraordinaire, able to captivate the audience from the first sentence. A devoted follower of the yoga and philosophy of Sri Aurobindo Ghose and the Mother of Pondicherry, India, he says he took to writing as part of his spiritual discipline. His book is boundless: his verbiage exudes a quiet confidence in each topic he undertakes, and he remained unflummoxed and undeterred while narrating on such diverse subject matters as Velupillai Prabhakaran and two-tier sales taxes.
Throughout, an aura of prescience permeates his prose. Words written decades and years and months ago feel newly relevant each passing day. One essay, in particular, is sure to bring sly smiles to all who read it. Aussies Down and Under: The Unprofessionalism of Professionals is undated, but the book was published in February of this yeara full month before members of the Australian cricket team were caught on camera using sandpaper to tamper with a ball during a test match against South Africa in Johannesburg.
And yet Wickramasinghes critique of the behavior of Australias cricket team is as applicable now, perhaps even more so, than it ever has been in the past.
Was it professionalism, which enabled the Aussies to succeed he asks in the essay. He writes of earlier cricket seasons, in which baseless ball tampering accusations were lobbed against Muttiah Muralitharan, and the entire Sri Lankan team was bemoaned and ridiculed by Australians.
Time and again some commentators and journalists tried to ridicule us  Sri Lankans eat rice and chicken bones; Hashan Tillakaratne cannot afford to pay hotel laundry and gives the laundry bags to his friend to wash at home; Ranatunga comes from the outstation and travel by bus for cricket practice; Sanath Jayasuriya is a village lad from a poor background; Muralitharans father sold confectionary on the pavement to educate his son.
Wickramasinghe concludes, No one wants to lose but an overwhelming fact is that the English and their cast-off brothers, Aussies, are very bad losers.
How right he was, though how prescient his essay would become just a month after his books publication, Wickramasinghe could not have known. At least, though, theres this: Mineka P. Wickramasinghe, with the publication of his expansive, no holds barred third book, is having the last laugh.

New unique agricultural  heritage sites designated - FAO
19 April 2018, Rome - Thirteen new landscapes were formally celebrated as Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) here today, paying tribute to the ingenious ways that human needs and natures resources have been combined to create mutually sustainable livelihoods and ecosystems.
The new sites in this landmark FAO program are in China, Egypt, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Portugal, Spain and Sri Lanka. Their primary production ranges from fruits, vegetables, salt and rice to silk, meat, tea and wasabi.
These systems reflect a profound harmony between humanity and nature, FAO Deputy Director-General Maria Helena Semedo said at an international forum in Rome.
The new additions bring to 50 the total number of GIAHS worldwide. The programme highlights unique ways that rural communities have over generations forged to foster food security, viable livelihoods, resilient ecosystems and high levels of biodiversity, all while enhancing remarkable beauty.
The sites are not about a nostalgic past but offer solutions for the present and the future, Semedo emphasized. GIAHS is also about innovation and opportunities, including broadening access to new markets and businesses such as eco-labelling, agri-tourism, youth empowerment to add value to our agricultural patrimony.
Among the new GIAHS sites are the first members from Europe and North America: An agro-sylvo-pastoral system in Barroso, Portugal, a unique way of making salt in Salinas de Aana, Spain, a millennial way of growing muscatel grapes in Axarqua, Spain, and a set ofartificially developed farmlandin Mexico City (Chinampas) based on oral transmission of traditional techniques widely used during the Aztec civilization.

New vehicle category quadricycles to hit the roads
A new category of motorised four-wheelers, quadricycles, is set to hit the roads in Colombo and other cities soon, as the Department of Motor Traffic (DMT) has successfully completed the roadworthy test which is compulsory for new vehicles.
According to the DMT, two new classes of vehicles have been introduced following Amendment No.18 of the Motor Traffic Act 2017 and quadricycle is one of them. Quadricycles would be added to the driving licence card. Accordingly, 10 quadricycles were registered this year.
Refuting allegations leveled against the new vehicle by various groups, National Council for Road Safety (NCRS) Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda told the Daily News that the council had conducted technical research for over two years prior to the introduction of the new vehicle category. Earlier, there had been several legal barriers for this vehicle category in India due to a court case.
However, in February this year, the Supreme Court of India had disposed the case and a draft notification had been issued by the Indian Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, approving the quadricycle as a vehicle category, he said, adding that the vehicle had completed its roadworthiness test and it was ready to launch.
Explaining the new vehicle category, Dr. Kodagoda said, A quadricycle is essentially a light-weight motorized four-wheeler between a motorcycle and a car. Compared to two-wheelers and three-wheelers, quadricycle is the safest vehicle category as it has four wheels which will discourage the drivers squeezing through other vehicles during rush hour. It is a fully covered vehicle category which has similar features like a mini car and four passengers could travel at once.
Predicting that the newly introduced vehicle category, quadricycle, would be a solution for traffic congestions, the NCRS Chairman said most road accidents were due to indiscipline, ignorance of the rules, neglect and disobedience. Therefore, the new vehicle category would be an innovative method in the country's road traffic management that could instill discipline in motorists.The NCRS Chairman added that false information was being circulated about the new vehicle category, that the quadricycle was unsafe as it failed the Euro NCAP (European New Car Assessment Programme) crash test.
But the truth is that as per European standards, quadricycles are not subject to crash testing, Dr. Kodagoda said.
Even though the quadricycle would not be an alternative to three-wheelers, it would discourage people from buying more three-wheelers as the quadricycle would serve as a family vehicle, Dr. Kodagoda added.
The council has held several discussions with three-wheeler associations before introducing the new vehicle category and they had endorsed the council's decision, he said.

Palagala and Galnewa could get water from Moragahakanda
Water from the Moragahakanda reservoir could be diverted to the Palagala and Galnewa areas in the Anuradhapura district, said Agriculture Minister and SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissnayake.
This issue has been taken for discussion recently with President Maithripala Sirisena who pioneered the Moragahakanda reservoir project, he said.
Minister Dissanayake was speaking after inaugurating the renovation work of Mahakambiliya and Ruwanmaduwa tanks under the Kiul Oya irrigational development project in the Vavuniya district, recently. The government will incurs Rs. 400 million for the tank rehabilitation project. These two tanks have been abandoned for decades and once rehabilitated, around 1,000 acres could be cultivated under them.
The minister said further that the whole country should be educated about the Moragahakanda project under which 100,000 acres come under cultivation in three kanna, a novel experience for Rajarata farmers. He said that if not for the flood and drought which devastated cultivations in three consecutive seasons, this period would have been the golden era of agriculture development in Sri Lanka under the leadership of President Sirisena.
Dissanayake emphasised that within the next five years the irrigational and water supply projects such an Yan Oya and Lower Malwathu Oya, NCP canal project, Upper Elahera canal project, and Wahalkada and Mahakanadarawa water projects would provide ample drinking and irrigational water to the Anuradhapura, Vauniya, Trincomalee, Mullaitivu, Jaffna, Mannar and Kurunegala districts.

Paper world
Here is a selection of pretty paper art creations by Russian Federation-based artist and designer Margaret Scrinkl, who imagines soft and poetic miniature worlds by patiently hand-cutting colorful paper. Small leaves, blossoms and other natural elements form the basis of her work cutting all of the details by hands, sometime looking like jewelry work. Paper is one of my favourite materials for work, she writes on Bored Panda.
I like to create my own tiny world using paper layers and texture. I am inspired by nature and pop culture, so I combined them and made a series of blooming social media logos. It gives me an infinite sense of spring. Cutting hundreds of plants is like meditation for me.
And looking at her artworks is like meditation for the viewers. So sit back and enjoy the intricate, delicate, pure world of Margarets paper cuttings

Petty cash resolution forced to be withdrawn
Panadura Pradesiya Sabha Chairman Waduge Hemantha Fernando had to withdraw a resolution tabled by him at the first monthly meeting on Tuesday, at the Wadduwa auditorium.
The Panadura PS is controlled by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna.
Fernando had tabled a resolution to get approval of the members to expend Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 10 lakhs for the administration activities of the PS for 2018, by way of petty cash.
UNP member Thahir Fazi protested against the resolution and was supported by the other councilors leading to Fernandos having to withdraw the resolution.
UNP member Kanthi Mangalika de Silva addressing the meeting said her brother who contested the local government election from the UNP was defeated, but she had been appointed as a member from the UNP list. In most local government bodies, defeated candidates were appointed as members from the lists of the political parties. This is a very undemocratic way of representing the voters. The government should abolish the present local government election law. All other members addressed the meeting paying tribute to the voters for appointing them to the Panadura Pradeshiya Sabha.

## Title: Post-confidence priorities

Post-confidence priorities
Political analysts have given many reasons for the very poor results obtained at the Local Government elections held on February 10, 2018, by the main coalition partners of the Unity Government  the UNP and the SLFP. It is argued that the low percentage of votes is a warning to the incumbent government that the average voter is not satisfied with the performance of the unity government during the last three years. In this article, I attempt to discuss how rational the decision of the average voter is who constituted the majority of the electorate when they exercised their sovereign right to vote and the priorities for the government which has only two more years to complete its term of administration.
The national unity government was formed in 2015 with the intention of reversing the practices and policies of the Rajapaksa regime which were anti-democratic and inconsistent with good governance. The government under the leadership of the President and the Prime Minister has taken some steps in the direction of satisfying the people. For example, the 19th Amendment to the Constitution can be regarded as a great achievement. This amendment abolished the draconian 18th Amendment and established the Constitutional Council and the independent Commissions such as the Police Commission and the Judicial Service Commission. All these independent Commissions are now functioning with a sense of responsibility. This amendment also contributed to restore and strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The incumbent Government which promised the people a corruption-free administration has taken several initiatives for establishing an effective institutional structure for investigating the allegations of corrupt deals such as taking bribes, money laundering and misappropriating funds belonging to the state institutions and institute legal proceedings against politicians and public officials of the former government. However, the people have lost confidence in the effectiveness and capability of the government to take legal action against political leaders of the former government. The people had lost confidence in the legal system because of the inordinate delay occurred in completing investigations and also in hearing cases filed after an investigation.
A factor that contributed to the complete erosion of public confidence in the government is the Central Bank Bond sale case. The President under irresistible pressure for action appointed the Commission for Investigation of Treasury Bond Scams in 2015 and 2016. The suspects in the Treasury Bond issues have already been charged under the Offences Against Public Property Act. Introducing the Judicature (Amendment) Bill in Parliament to set up a permanent High Court-at-Bar to expeditiously dispose of cases involving economic and financial crimes of very serious and complex nature is a commendable initiative taken by the government. The High Court-at-Bar consisting of three judges of the High Court will hold trials day-to-day for expeditious disposal of cases referred to it.
Economic factor
During the Local Government election propaganda campaign, the Joint Opposition emphasized the economic difficulties faced by the people due to the increasing prices of essential food items such as rice and coconut. Sri Lanka experienced a drought which continued for more than two years which affected the rice cultivation and also the coconut production. However, the average voter expressed his sense of disappointment with the government by voting against the parties in power. The feeling that the government should have provided some relief by making the essential items available to the people at an affordable price and also that the government should provide some relief to the farmers by way of an insurance scheme or by some other arrangement is justifiable. The paddy cultivators also complained that fertilizer was not available on the open market.
It appears that the overall economic situation in the country is not satisfactory. The rate of economic growth remains at 3.1 percent during the last 16 years and the value of the rupee is gradually falling against the US dollar. There is also a big burden of foreign debt settlement as a result of obtaining foreign loans, mainly from China, for infrastructure development. As such, there is an urgent need to review and make necessary changes in economic planning by a body of economic and financial experts. However, under the leadership of the President and the Prime Minister, we can observe some positive developments also. We can see the progress made in the construction of a network of highways. Investors, both local and foreign, will welcome these connectivity projects. This government has not completely forgotten the rural farmer in the Dry Zone during the three year period of its administration. Moragahakanda Dam construction project was completed last year to provide an adequate quantity of water to the five great tanks in the region.
Unity of the coalition partners
The main factor that contributed to the dwindling public support for the coalition partners of the National Unity Government is the apparent lack of unity among the coalition partners, the SLFP and the UNP. There are even some ministers in the Cabinet who criticize the policies of the government. Some members of the SLFP even suggest that they should sever all their connections with the UNP and form a separate government. They even suggest that they should cooperate with the SLPP led by Mahinda Rajapaksa. Therefore, the need of the hour is to strengthen the unity between the SLFP led by the President and the UNP led by the Prime Minister. The total disregard for the principle of collective responsibility by some members of the Cabinet was demonstrated when they voted in support of the no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister on April 04, 2018. Therefore, a Cabinet reshuffle aimed at forming a government with ministers who are genuinely committed for achieving the common objectives of forming the National Unity Government, after the regime change in 2015, is a matter to which top priority should be given.
Post-war reconciliation process
After the end of the war in 2009, the Sri Lankan government has done a considerable amount of work to bring about reconciliation between the Sinhalese community and the Tamil community. The United Nations too has assumed a significant role by recommending what steps should be taken by the Sri Lankan government for genuine reconciliation to ensure real and sustainable peace. In compliance with the commitments undertaken by Sri Lanka by co-sponsoring the UNHRC Resolution 30/1, Sri Lanka has enacted Enforced Disappearances Act in March this year. The Office of Missing Persons too was set up by appointing the Commissioners. Legislation has already been drafted for the establishment of an Office to handle Reparations and a Truth Commission.
Regarding the recommendation for the establishment of a tribunal for hearing cases regarding the allegations of violations of international human rights law, and international humanitarian law during the last stage of the war, by the Sri Lankan armed forces and the LTTE, consisting of both local and foreign judges, there is serious objection by the Joint Opposition and by some civil society groups. However, the President has expressed the position that he is against the inclusion of foreign judges in such tribunals. The Sri Lankan delegation that represented Sri Lanka at the 37th session of the UNHRC has brought to the attention of the members of the UNHRC that the Sri Lankan governments position is that there is no need to include foreign judges in such tribunals for the reason that, according to the Foreign Minister Marapana, Sri Lankas judiciary and law enforcement mechanisms are fully capable of and committed to the processes of advancing justice to all concerned. It has a long history of integrity and professionalism.
Although the Sri-Lankan government has co-sponsored the resolution 30/1, the Sri-Lankan governments position is that the Eelam War IV was a humanitarian operation and our soldiers have not committed any violations amounting to war crimes. However, since there is a serious allegation by the international community and the United Nations against the armed forces, it is necessary to hold a credible investigation acceptable to the United Nations regarding these allegations for the purpose of clearing the good name of the armed forces who carried out the military operations with due regard to the rights of the civilians and also the human rights of the LTTE fighters. There is, however, vehement objection to the entire reconciliation process by the political parties of the Joint Opposition and some civil society organisations, especially a section of the Buddhist priests and some retired military officers who are engaged in a propaganda campaign for toppling the reconciliation process by toppling the government.
The critics of the reconciliation process vehemently oppose the proposed constitutional reforms too. They propagate the idea that the new constitution would fulfill the aspirations of the sponsors of UNHRC resolutions, the USA and other countries supporting it and more specifically the Tamil Diaspora. The liberal political parties of the North and East Sri Lanka who are in the Tamil National Alliance have categorically stated that they are for a united, undivided and indivisible Sri Lanka. They state that what they need is a substantial devolution of power to the Provincial Councils, that too within a unitary form of government to make the devolution of power meaningful and some reasonable power-sharing at the Centre.

These filaments are directly imported from the USA, and are properly tipped and flagged to release the paint evenly and smoothly onto the surface with little to no effort.
All paint brushes are crafted using stainless steel ferules and the finest quality rubber wood handles. The agility, longer lifespan and versatility of the brush for application on any surface, truly makes it one of a kind. Our Multilac brushes have more filaments that ensure great paint pick up and smooth paint flow, so that the painter will be able to finish the job faster, with the least effort
Ismail further explained. The Macksons mantra of producing only environmental friendly products, that are safe to our consumers, is once again amply proven in putting this paint brush together, as every raw material is meticulously sourced without harming the wild life habitat and we do not use any animal hair. Furthermore the rubber used for our brush handles are also picked from aged rubber trees.

He made this comment while at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce with an Iranian delegation that included, among others, Iranian Ambassador to Sri Lanka Mohammed Zaeri Amirani.
Strong bilateral cooperation and friendship will continue to grow from strength to strength.
The future looks bright for Iran and Sri Lanka ties, said Ambassador Amirani.
Chief Economist of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Shiran Fernando elaborated on the event with the Iranian delegation, which was closed off to local press, saying that it consisted of a general bilateral discussion between both sides.

## Title: Private tuition
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Editorial

Private tuition
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has declared that private tuition, at all levels, would be banned during normal school hours (7.30 a.m. to 1.30 p.m.), shortly. He also opined that attending tuition classes from the kindergarten to Grade 13 has become almost a fashion today rather than a learning exercise. According to the minister the National Education Commission (NEC) has proposed the setting up of a State body to monitor and streamline private tuition since this was now a major industry generating over Rs. 1 billion a month. The necessity has also arisen to check on the qualifications of the so called tuition Sirs following findings by the NEC that a majority of them did not measure up to the required standards.
The ministers proposal no doubt is commendable but he is bound to face stiff resistance, both, from parents and the purveyors of the private tuition industry. To begin with, unlike in the past when teaching was considered a noble profession and teachers worked with dedication, in the present day they are a frustrated lot, chiefly due to poor emoluments and other hardships such as been subjected to arbitrary transfers and they do as little as they possibly can in the classroom to the great detriment of their charges. Besides, teachers too are in the thick of the private tuition industry as depicted in the many posters advertising their services where they never fail to mention their standing in some of the popular schools in the country.
Another reason why parents are keen on sending their children for private tuition is the present mad rush to come on top in the all island list in the GCE (OL/AL) results and also the Year 5 scholarship examination, giving credence to the ministers claim that the children are being sent for private tuition from the kindergarten to Grade 13, after a fashion. The wide publicity given in the media to the successful students, no doubt, has egged on the parents to do whatever is needed to get their children on the pedestal. Besides, the vast expansion in the field of education, the introduction of totally new subjects such as information technology and computer science, which did not figure in the past, has made it easy for the private education enterprises to flourish and for pretenders and charlatans to cash in on the demand, as per the National Education Commission findings.
Hence, private tuition has come to stay, whether one likes it or not, like any other enterprise under the culture of the open economy solely operating for profit, while professing to render a service through catering to the demands of the modern generation of school goers. Hence, what has to be done is rather than attempt to dislodge this industry, to monitor the activities of all such enterprises to ensure the seekers of this facility are not duped. The appointment of a State body to oversee the activities of private tuition enterprises therefore is a move in the right direction. It should begin by carrying out thorough checks on the professed qualification and competence of the instructors of private education institutions. Close watch should also be made on the conduct of the students at these institutions. This is because there had been reports that these private tuition classes have been convenient meeting places for young school going couples. There have also been allegations that drugs are used by students attending these classes.
Be that as it may, parents who are fixated on the academic success of their offspring should also not ignore the health aspect. An overdose of book learning, round the clock, could be detrimental to both mind and body. Like the minister noted, today children run helter-skelter for private tuition classes after school, leaving them hardly any time for any physical activity. It is increasingly been reported in health circles that incidents of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure in young adolescents had witnessed a steep rise in recent times chiefly brought about by obesity which is a direct result of lack of exercise. While every parent will wish to have a bright son or daughter, they should also not ignore the concept of healthy mind in a healthy body.
That Murali doosra
Spin legend and world record holder for the most number of test wickets Muttiah Muralitharan hit the nail on the head when he said politicians have destroyed Sri Lanka cricket. His views, no doubt, will be shared by a majority of Lankan cricket fans who have the best interest of Sri Lanka cricket at heart. In an interview with the Economic Times of India Murali, as he is known in the cricketing world, to a question by the interviewer on what is wrong with Sri Lanka cricket said; To tell you the truth, Sri Lanka cricket is currently in a mess. Politicians have taken over the game and with little or no knowledge of the game they are destroying the institution with each passing day.
Most people would say that it is the politicians who have messed up everything in this country since Independence. It was only a matter of time before the gentlemans game too would be made inroads into.

A group of UNP backbenchers have written a letter to the Prime Minister asking UNP MP Mujibur Rahman be appointed as the Deputy Speaker of Parliament.
Reportedly, 20 UNPers had signed the letter.
The post fell vacant when former Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala resigned from the post in early March to actively take part in political work.
Sumathipala was also targeted to censure of the UNP for voting in favour of the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against the Prime Minister as it was considered that Sumithipala voted in favour of the NCM whilst being the Deputy Speaker.
UNP MP Rahman speaking to Daily News said the UNPers had handed over the letter, but he was not sure how it would happen.
Under the arrangement of the national government, it had been previously agreed that if the UNP held the post of Speaker, the post of Deputy Speaker would go to the SLFP.
It has to go to a SLFPer. I am not sure how it will work out, Rahman said.

Resus Energy gears to feed more power to national grid
Hydro electricity is the oldest and the principal source of electricity generation in Sri Lanka. Its unique geography renders the country perfectly suited for hydropower generation through large scale and mini hydropower plants. Joining the latest technologies with an environmentally responsible business proposition to generate renewable and sustainable energy, Resus Energy PLC operates several such mini hydropower plants in Sri Lanka.
While increasingly supporting the national effort to develop renewable energy resources in Sri Lanka, Resus Energy PLC last week acquired Sierra Power (Pvt) Ltd and is currently developing its hydropower project in the Nuwara Eliya district. Fed by the Madulla Oya, the project will feed an estimated 2 MW to the national grid.
The Company is also currently developing two more mini hydro power projects, both in their construction stages; the Ranwala Oya Project in the Kegalle district and Hulu Ganga Project in the Kandy District, both of which are estimated to contribute up to 700 KW and 1.9 MW respectively.
As a company that is truly interested in the people and the planet in pursuit of its primary business goals, Resus Energy PLC, believes in creating a shared value that benefits all its stakeholders. Towards this end, we consistently strive to make sure that our carbon footprint remains at an absolute minimal level even as we scale up on our operations. Resus Energy PLC gives priority to ensure that none of its operations have negative impacts on the environment, said Managing Director of Resus Energy PLC, Kishan Nanayakkara.
In the recent past Resus Energy PLC completed two more mini hydropower projects in its continuing efforts to further increase its supply to the national grid. In 2016 was the Gomale Oya mini hydropower project in Maliboda, and in 2017 was the Moragaha Oya mini hydropower project in Kandy, both generating an additional 1.4 MW and 1.5 MW respectively to the grid.
We take great pride in our hydropower generation operations and in our ability to transmit over 30GWh of electricity to the national grid that eventually powers our nation. We take great responsibility in harnessing renewable and sustainable energy and to also ensure that all our projects have little or no impact on the environment. We intend to work very hard towards more efficient extraction of power and use sustainable technology as available to do so in the future, Nanayakkara added.
Resus Energy PLC took its initial steps in renewables in 2007 with the development of 2.0MW Giddawa mini hydropower project in Teldeniya using water from the Hulu Ganga.
This was followed in 2010, with the acquisition 2.6MW Upper Agra Oya mini hydropower project in Lindula. In 2011 it developed and commissioned the 2.4MW Upper Magal Ganga hydropower project in Maliboda,
While the core growth strategy of Resus Energy PLC is centred around hydropower, the company has also been consistently exploring other renewable energy sources such as solar power, wind power and biomass. Resus Energy PLC has been awarded the rights for two 01 MW each solar power plants feeding into the Ampara grid substation under the CEBs Soorya Bala Sangramaya Phase 1, that it is currently under pre-development stage.
Over the last few years Resus Energy PLC has been consistently recognised for its successful efforts. The company won in the Bronze category at The National Green Awards (Okanda Power Grid Pvt. Ltd.) for the Upper Magalganga Hydropower Power Project in 2017. It also won Silver at the CA Sri Lanka Annual Report Awards in 2015, 2016 and 2017, and, was a Runner Up in the SME Category at the ACCA Sustainability Reporting Awards in 2017.
Designed and developed using expert local knowledge, the latest technology and a true passion for nature conservation, Resus Energy projects are all planned and executed sustainably and responsibly. All project development budgets also include a considerable portion to develop the surrounding communities of each project.
Resus Energy PLC has provided infrastructural development to public properties, scholarship funds, community programs and employment to the surrounding communities of its projects. As a forerunner in renewable and sustainable energy and, focussed and efficient innovations, Resus Energy PLC is well placed to contribute more towards powering the nation in the future.

Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery back  at work after renovation
The Ceylon Petroleum Corporations (CPC) Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery successfully completed a colossal 35-day overhaul and renovation programme recently, aimed to boost efficiency, reliability and productivity of the refinery.
The 50-year-old facility,which is the only oil refinery in Sri Lanka, refines imported crude oil to supply 30% of the energy demand of the nation. The scheduled renovation in 2018 is a procedure commissioned every 3 years and it focuses on maintenance and replacing critical facilities and equipment to operate the refinery at optimum levels.
The renovation project took place in the three main sections of the plant, namely the Process Plant, Utilities and the Tank Farm.
The large-scale overhaul of the refinery saw the complete shutdown of the facility. The supply gap due to the shutdown of the facility was filled by procuring imported oil by CPC,months ahead of the scheduled 2018 maintenance project.
The Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery Facility overhaul saw around the clock inspections, quality testing and maintenance of equipment. This years maintenance of the refinery importantly replaced several critical equipment in the Crude Distillation, Naphtha Hydrotreater, Reformer and Gas oil Hydrotreater units that werenearly50 years old. Simultaneously during this period, maintenance work took place in the Utilities and the Tank Farm areas.
Chairman of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, Dammika Ranatunga commenting on the critical refinery overhaul said, We are committed to ensure the countrys future energy needs are met without any interruption. We have adopted a long-term strategy to uplift the quality and productivity of the Sapugaskanda Oil refinery by installing the latest high-end equipment and renovating key facilities this year. It is a very important project for us as on the long run it ensures we supply uninterrupted energy in an efficient and productive manner. Our vision is to build and strengthen our countrys energy security. We plan to incorporate modern standards and processes to transform Sri Lankas energy landscape to one of the best in Asia.
The renovation process commenced on the 19th of February 2018. Over 1200Employees including Engineers and Mechanics of the refinery worked diligently and often round the clock during the 35 day period to complete renovations as per schedule.
Further, the entire renovation process was monitored closely by a quality assurance team and stringent safety standards and global quality testing procedures by The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the American Petroleum Institute(API)were followed.
Situated on a 165 acre land, the Sapugaskanda refinery currently produces 50,000 barrels per day and consists of five large oil tanks with a capacity of 40,000 metric tonnes each.
The refinery imports crude oil from the Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia, Oman, Abu Dhabi, etc. The imported crude oil is distilled by the stipulated refinery standards and processes. The Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery produces 92 Octane Petrol, Auto Diesel, Kerosene, Jet A1,Bitumen, and LPG and supplies energy to Sri Lankas major industries.

## Title: SAVING SRI LANKAN PUPPETRY
## Supertitle:

SAVING SRI LANKAN PUPPETRY
Gamvari Supun Tharanga (26), a Peradeniya University Graduate with a degree in Computation and Management is an unlikely candidate to save the art of puppetry from oblivion and yet, he has stepped up to ensure that the traditions of his ancestors continue well into the 21st Century and beyond.
Ambalangoda was once the heart of puppetry in the South but over the years, as puppeteers left for more lucrative work and people focused more on their television sets than the puppets, the industry has faced a slow death. To keep the art alive and to provide it with a space to thrive, Tharanga opened a puppet museum called Puppeteers of Lanka which draws talent from Ambalangoda and the villages surrounding it.
This Puppetry Museum located on Galle road is in close proximity to Balapitiya Base Hospital. According to Tharanga, the main purpose of the museum was to bring to life simple traditional life styles, including the attire of the rural agricultural community which many do not see any more. The traditional kitchen and kitchen utensils found in the dwellings in rural Sri Lanka is also fund at this Puppetry museum.
I wanted to show people the kind of lifestyles we had and to capture what a typical Sri Lankan kitchen looked like, he said.
The museum also depicts various characters of the British Colonial Administration who had exploited the locals in puppet form. In addition, puppets have also been made to retell popular legends, Jataka stories and Sri Lankan mythology.
History of puppetry in Sri Lanka
Opinions differ over the introduction of puppetry to Sri Lanka, but the majority of historians believe that puppeteers from India on their visits to Sri Lanka had introduced it. Further the Chulawamsa made references to puppetry during a religious festival held in the Kingdom of Dambadeniya during the reign of King Parakramabahu the Second.
Puppetry is considered a universal art form and not confined to one particular nation, culture, religious or ethnic group. In Buddhist Jataka stories, references are made to puppetry and puppet festivals are also held by the Catholic devotees depicting events of religious significance.
According to ethnographic and anthropological research findings, the origin of puppetry goes back to more than 30,000 years. Greek Philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato had made references to puppetry in their philosophical treatises. During the archaeological excavations made in childrens grave yards in ancient locations in Egypt, Rome and the Indus Valley Civilization, puppets quite similar to dolls having movable heads made out of terracotta and animal tusks have been discovered. Indian Epics such as the Ramayana and Mahabarata and Greek Epics such as the Odyssey and Iliad have also been dramatized using puppets.
Running in the family
Tharangas father, Gamini Rupasiri is the owner of Gamini Rupasiri Puppetry Dance Institute in Viharagoda, Kandegoda; a village famous for puppeteers and located in close proximity to Ambalangoda.
Tharanga, since the age of seven had shown an inherent desire to gather knowledge of in every aspect of puppetry under his father and the other experienced puppet dancers who took part in performances staged in various parts of the country, said Rupasiri.
Rupasiri however, runs a tailoring shop today because he can no longer survive on puppetry alone. He is not the only puppeteer who had to retire his puppets for pragmatic reasons. Ambalangoda and its suburbs on the Southern coast of Sri Lanka has been identified as a repository of traditional folk art, folk dramas, mask dance, ancient rituals and belief systems which have been passed down from one generation to the next for the last few centuries. Ganvari Podisirina Gurunnanse was renown in the sphere of puppetry and is popularly known to be the founder of this dance form to the villages around Ambalangoda.
As his fathers art form diminishes, Tharanga said, his ambition was to preserve the puppetry tradition of the chief pioneer Podi Sirina Gurunnanse. This is important as the puppetry now is on the verge of disappearing forever.
Podi Sirina Gurunnanse
In 1922, when the Prince of Wales visited Sri Lanka, the colonial government at the time held an exhibition at Victoria Park in Colombo to mark the occasion. Podi Sirina Gurunnanse received the rare opportunity to perform a puppet dance on this historical day as a mark of respect to the Prince of Wales and his retinue of other members of the Royalty. The story goes that the Prince was so enthralled by the puppet show performed by Podi Sirina Gurunnanse, that he offered him a sum of Rs. 500 and a gold medal in recognition of his talents and thus he was the first puppeteer to bring recognition to the country for the folk art of puppetry.
Late F. R. Senanayake, P. de S. Kularatne, Professor G. P. Malalasekara, Professor Tissa Kariyawasam and Dr. Jayadewa Thilakasiri were also among the prominent intellectuals who recognized the value of puppetry as a rare form of folk dance to be protected from extinction.
Dr.Thilakasiris research findings on puppetry according to his study, The Puppet Theatre of Asia noted that in 1952, there were five different traditions of puppet dancing groups established in the villages around Ambalangoda. But all these groups were believed to be disciples of Podi Sirina Gurunnanse and they had all learnt their art from him. Over time, they had fine-tuned what they had learnt to come up with their own individual performances.
The pioneer of puppetry, Podi Sirina Gurunnanse passed away in 1936.
After his demise, his two sons, G. Daniel Gurunnanse and G. Jamis Gurunnanse and several other famous puppeteers of the era namely Aranolis Gurunnanse of Kandegoda, Jayaneris Gurunnanse of Bogahawatta, Saranelis Gurunnanse and Charles Gurunnanse of Kandegoda were the other founding members of a group of puppet dancing known as Dakshina Lanka Puppeteers.
Other pioneers of puppetry
Gamvari Loveneris was another renowned puppeteer having unique talents and lived at Bogahawatta adjoining Ambalangoda. Loveneris excelled in every aspect of puppetry. From carving puppets depicting various characters, painting, costume making, make up, singing and playing musical instruments; he did it all by himself in addition to manipulating puppets on the stage.
Loveneris was taught by his father, Gamvari Surathan Gurunnanse but he passed away when Loveneris was only four. Thereafter, Jayaneris Gurunnanse; a famous puppeteer took over and groomed young Loveneris to be a fully-fledged puppeteer.
Downward trend in puppetry
Gamvari Premin is a grandson of Gamvari Podi Sirina Gurunnanse and today, Premin is working hard to protect his grandfathers legacy. He lives at Viharagoda, a suburban village in Ambalangoda.
Premin had represented Sri Lankan puppetry in a number of International Puppetry Festivals held in several Asian and European countries and a few years back, Premin was appointed as the Chairman of Puppetry Panel of the Arts Council of the Cultural Department. He attributed the downward trend of puppetry to its unprofitable nature as a livelihood.
Majority of puppeteers have already given up puppetry and resorted to other forms of livelihood. Certain professional puppeteers, instead of taking part in performances of puppetry dancing, are now engaged in carving puppets for sale in tourist resorts. According to Premin, out of 200 professional puppeteers based in and around the villages of Ambalangoda, only 15 of them really engage in puppet dancing.
It is highly regrettable today that even the state institutions in the Southern Province including Ambalangoda where puppetry originated from, has forgotten this traditional form of puppet dancing, he said. Nalin Gamvari and Vipula Gamvari are the two sons of Loveneris Gurunnanse who inherited puppetry from their father since their early childhood.
Nalin won a gold medal in 1980 and produced a musical puppet play on hunger to mark World Food Day. Nalin was also the first to perform in the history of puppetry in Sri Lanka, a puppet show underwater at Hikkaduwa. It was filmed by the Finnish divers.
In 1988, Nalin attended the third International Puppet Festival held in Japan and in the same year, he represented Sri Lanka in a puppet festival held in Pakistan. He has also been the only puppeteer in Ambalangoda, keen on producing puppet dramas exposing social, political conflicts and the exploitation and abuse of power.
Both Nalin Gamvari and his brother Vipula Gamvari, just like their father Gamvari Loveneris, are well versed in all aspects of puppetry.
They have represented Sri Lanka in International Puppet Festivals held in France, Spain, China, India and several Asian and European countries. Despite their efforts however, it has been an uphill task for these accomplished puppeteers, Puppetry is no longer recognized in this country as a form of entertainment. The authorities pay little attention to it and just celebrate World Puppet Day and soon forget it thereafter, said Nalin.Gamvari Supun Tharanga and a few other remaining puppeteers.

SEP to hold public meeting on May 1
The Socialist Equality Party (SEP) will hold a public meeting in Colombo on May 1 to celebrate the solidarity of the international working class and oppose the governments attempts to sabotage May Day celebrations.
Issuing a statement on the World Socialist Web Site (WSWS), the SEP said that the meeting will be held at New Town Hall at 3 pm.
On March 28, President Maithripala Sirisena announced that the Cabinet had decided to postpone all May Day meetings, rallies and marches scheduled for May 1 to May 7, which has been proclaimed a holiday.
The President said that the decision was taken on the advice of the Maha Nayaka Theras in order to avoid an overlap with the Buddhist festival of Vesak.
SEP in their statement further said that the governments decision to undermine May Day is in line with its promotion of reactionary Sinhala-Buddhist chauvinism.
"It is bound up with the enormous political crisis of the government. Amid a growing wave of strikes and protests, the government fears that May Day could become a focal point for the hostility of workers, the oppressed and rural poor, and a threat to bourgeois rule," they said.
They noted that workers have waged a series of strikes in different sectors, including the universities, ports, electricity, petroleum, postal, railway, health and plantations, despite the efforts of the trade unions to derail and suppress them.
"The working class is opposing the governments ruthless attacks on living and social conditions in implementing the programme of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
They called on workers and youth to attend the May Day rally organised by the SEP and its youth movement, the International Youth and Students for Social Equality (IYSSE).

Shares in Shire rose 4% to 39.15, having risen from about 31 a share a month ago amid takeover speculation.
Late last month Takeda said it was considering making an offer for Shire.
The Japanese firm said it was interested in a takeover to strengthen its cancer, stomach and brain drug portfolio. BBC News

SLTU protests Uva CMs reappointment
Once schools reopen next week, Sri Lanka Teachers Union (SLTU) plans to engage in a trade union action against the decision taken to reappoint Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dassanayake as the Provincial Education Minister again.
SLTU Secretary Joseph Stalin told the Daily News that the reappointment is unethical since the investigations into the alleged charges of the chief minister are still being carried out.
The chief minister is facing charges of having made the Badulla Tamil Maha Vidyalaya Principal kneel before him, for not accepting a letter given by him for the admission of a student to that school. The chief minister, who surrendered to the Badulla Police in connection with this charge, was later granted bail after being produced before the Badulla District Court.
Stalin added that the reappointment is unjust and unethical as the chief minister is still on bail and the case is still being heard at courts. Besides, the investigation of the Education Ministry has not yet come to the end. The report of the Human Right Commission in connection with the incident is also pending. Moreover, the report of the committee appointed by the Uva Provincial Governor has not been finalised yet.
At this juncture, this reappointment is a great injustice for the whole teacher and principal community.
He added that the SLTU had requested the President to cancel the reappointment until the investigations are finished.
If we dont receive a favourable response, the SLTU will launch a trade union action in this regard once the school are reopened, he said.

Snake diet !
The latest diet trend buzzing around the health world is the Snake Diet.Cole Robinson, a trainer developed the diet after being frustrated with advise his clients were receiving from the coaches and trainer, he explained on his website.
The concept of the meal plan is to literally eat like a snake. Having one big meal and let that sustain you for a while.
On his website, Robinson explained the diet's three phases:
l Clear your liver of toxins by fasting for 48 hours and drink apple cider vinegar and what he calls a "snake juice", which is an "essential mineral replacement", the Snake diet website claims.
l Phase two includes fasting on and off.
l Next phase is all about "maintenance" and learning to understand when your body is hungry.
On Youtube, Robinson goes into more details about the diet and claims the diet can cure diabetes, herpes, inflammation and aid weight loss.
Now down to the big question: Is it safe
Experts say there is no evidence to suggest it is and would not recommend it. I would not recommend it to anyone for even a short-term trial, as it is not based on any clear evidence nor does it have any clinical evidence that is peer-reviewed to support the program, says Julie Upton, R.D., and co-founder of Appetite for Health, told Women's Health.
Beth Warren, R.D.N., founder of Beth Warren Nutrition and author of Living a Real Life with Real Food, agreed.
"You cant live healthfully on a fast long term," registered dietitian Sonya Angelone, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics said.

Sri Lanka to press ahead with reforms, revenue on target: Eran Wickremeratne

Sri Lanka will continue to press ahead with reforms and the revenue for the start of the year is on target, State Finance Minister Eran Wickramaratne said in an interview.
We are more or less on track with the reform program, said Wickramaratne, who represents the United National Party in the coalition government. A fuel price formula will be implemented as planned and sales of state-owned hotels will proceed, he said in Washington, where finance chiefs and central bank bosses are gathered for the IMF and World Bank Spring meetings.
Staying the course on reforms is key to Sri Lanka being able to tap loans from the International Monetary Fund, whose terms include a fuel pricing mechanism to help cut losses at state-run refiners. A March deadline for that step was missed. The south Asian nation took a $1.5 billionloanfrom the IMF in 2016 to stave off a balance of payments crisis.
In February, President Maithripala Sirisena reshuffled the cabinet for the second time since forming a unity government in 2015 after its two main coalition partners were defeated in local government elections. This month, he suspended the parliament until May 8 ahead of planned defections from his party to an opposition group led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Wickramaratne said exports continue to increase and he played down fears of a global trade war.
There is a rise of populism globally and I think its a phase that will go through and eventually settle down to economic realism, which is that major trading partners will gain by coming to some kind of understanding, Wickramaratne said. I would say it is a glitch.

Striving for perfection
Lyceum International School, Wattala sees drama as a bright light that illuminates the minds and hearts of their dramatists. This time Dramatic Moves speaks to illuminated minds of Lyceum International School, Wattala about their walk on stage.
Teacher in Charge Michaela Peiris says drama has empowered her by providing many opportunities for personal development.
Life is a drama, almost all the time. So why not take it as a skill, put it to practice and convey a good message to the society For me drama means a lot. In one aspect, I wasnt a person who got many opportunities when I was in school for drama at the time. So this is a personal satisfaction. Drama is an art. I love art, as it is a combination of innovation, creativity, spontaneity and team spirit, said Peiris.
Peiris has seen how drama has made dreams of the students come true, providing them the same opportunities she received for personal development when she first took up drama.
For the many years I have been teaching at Lyceum Wattala, I have noticed major changes in my students just because of drama. It has given them the opportunity to explore their talents not only in acting but also in confidence, interaction, stage fright and social skills. Therefore drama does benefit them in many ways. In addition I have seen children who take drama as a main stream of learning after school, although they did not do it as a subject in school. So Inter-house drama has changed their career decisions too, said Peiris.
For Trainer Usitha Ranatunge, it has been an absolute pleasure teaching these students. Throughout the years he has derived immense happiness by seeing these students exhibit their talents on stage.
I have been involved with drama since 2008. When I was schooling, it was an opportunity for me to take up different roles on stage and perform. I loved the process of getting into character and the thrill of acting on stage to entertain a crowd. But since of late my focus is on directing and conveying a message to the audience which would resonate with them. I really enjoy working with young thespians who take their roles seriously. Discussing their character with them and experimenting with what works and what doesnt on stage is enjoyable. I tend to push them a lot but seeing them nail it on the night of their performance, it makes me immensely happy, said Ranatunge.
Ranatunge points out that when you are lost in character it makes you one with it and it is no longer what the character feels, but it is what you feel. When you reach that point that is when the most genuine performances come out. The audience can really tell when you really feel something, as opposed to when you try to feel something. An actor who is true to the character they play and the emotions they feel gives me goose bumps, explains Ranatunge.
Ranatunge describes the job of a trainer as a form of art and the beauty of that is there is no fixed way of doing it. Drama gives one a sense of freedom that is really beautiful, he explained.
School can be a restrictive place. You are expected to keep silent and listen in class. I try to loosen up the kids as much as possible and show them that drama is a place to have fun, enjoy and express themselves. Its all about creating a friendly environment where they feel appreciated and not judged for whatever they come up with. My house will be taking part in the Inter-house school cup this year with an extract of Crucible this June. I also plan to take Lyceum Wattala for Inter-shakes later this year. We will also be taking part in the state childrens drama festival under the direction of Sudarshana Bandara, added Ranatunge.
President Anupa Ranchagoda, says the play Julius Caesar stands out in his memory.
It taught me the good side and the bad side of humans. This is something that I will treasure and use in the future after I leave school to become a better person in the society, avoiding all things that mean harm to humans, said Ranchagoda
The Merchant of Venice by the Workshop Players is by far his most favourite and memorable play. The actor who portrayed Shylock inspired him and many of his friends to improve their acting skills. From the characters I have enacted or seen, Willy Loman from Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman" is one of my favourites. The whole process of getting into the old man's shoes and becoming him for like an hour felt fantastic and life-changing. That is one character I will never forget and I would enjoy portraying again. This is the highlight in my drama career as it won me the award for the Best Actor of the year 2017/18, said Ranchagoda.
Theruni Galagedera rated Les Miserables performed by the Workshop Players as one of the most memorable plays she has seen.
It was actually my first time watching a play, and it did not cease to amaze. From the acting and singing it was honestly just magic up there, and the only thought running through my head was, I want to be a part of it too, said Galagedera
From the few roles Galagedera has enacted her favourite is Lady Macbeth. Her role, the powerful, evil, manipulative woman, was something that I had so much fun playing, and also which came out quite naturally, and the drastic reduction to a weeping, deranged woman, although extremely challenging was yet again, an amazing and adrenaline-fueled experience. Its one role Im always grateful for being given the chance to perform it. My highlight, at Lyceum Wattala, without a doubt would be my portrayal of Lady Macbeth. Its the role that got me going, helped build that confidence, and most importantly what aggressively sparked this insane love for drama. If I had to pick a play that would go down in Lyceum Wattala drama history, from the ones Ive seen, it has to be Macbeth. I genuinely believe that our cast did justice to the play and it was portrayed beautifully, explained Galagedera.
The bonds she has formed and the friendships that she has made are everlasting.
Drama brings people together. And if theres one thing Im going to take with me, from having done drama at school, it would be to work as a team, be loyal, and be there for the people you love. You know that your cast is going to be there for you through it all, and how supporting one another, can improve everyones potential.
And if nothing at least, youll find a person or two, thatll stick by you, when all else fails. Drama has been the most amazing experience in my school career by a long-shot. And now, its helped me in more ways than one. It has taught me how to be more confident, a better people-person, and how to change masks to suit any situation or person, added Galagedera.
Devruk Ratnayake also rates Macbeth as one of his favourite and memorable plays. We managed to put together a remarkable cast with great potential, who were talented in various unique ways. Even though I played a minor role (Banquo) I enjoyed the drama. Its dark plot and its mature outlook of some characters really makes it interesting and overall, enticing to explore. The possibilities with such plays are endless, said Ratnayake.
King Lear is another favourite role. I feel it is a beautiful portrayal of how a man with everything can easily lose it all. I also feel it takes a lot of skill and work to pull off a character such as Lears, explained Ratnayake.
Ratnayake says drama has helped him understand the proper way to react to any scenario and to adapt and be versatile to the situation. It has also helped him see art and beauty even in the ugliest or most horrifying circumstances.
Drama has helped me influence countless people. It is one of the only activities that teaches public expression. I find it beautiful that one man can effect or influence an audience of hundreds. To twist their emotions to either make them cry or laugh, at your will. It has taught me the key aspects to influence anybody, whether it is on stage, or offstage, pointed out Ratnayake.

Survey reveals fresh capital  initiatives to Lankan banking sector
New regulatory and accounting requirements, tougher competition and disruptive technology will force Sri Lankas banks to find cost savings and tap local markets for fresh capital, says Euro Money Survey on Sri Lanka banking sector.
Smaller or struggling lenders that cannot or will not do so may well find themselves swept away, analysts warn, by a wave of much-needed consolidation, it adds.
In June 2017, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka said that all licensed lenders would have to meet new minimum capital standards, in line with Basel III guidelines, while any systemically important lender with more than Rs 500 billion ($3.2 billion) in assets must raise its capital adequacy ratio to 14% from 10% by January 1, 2019.
Six lenders currently meet that threshold, notably BoC and Peoples Bank, the two largest domestic lenders by assets, and Commercial Bank of Ceylon (ComBank). All other licensed lenders would need to increase their ratios to 12.5% from 10%.
Some have been stocking up ahead of the storm. Sampath Bank completed the countrys first Basel III-compliant debenture in December 2017, raising SLRs6 billion; it plans to raise another Rs 7.5 billion worth of tier-two capital this year. The other main challenge is one that banks face everywhere. New IFRS9 standards set out by the International Accounting Standards Board require banks to set aside provisions for future losses, not just losses already reported.
The new accounting rules are expected to push up non-performing loans and raise risk costs across the entire sector, research firm Exotix warned in a note published in March, adding that certain lenders would be hit harder than others.
The London-based research house says it expects rising NPLs and the new IFRS9 rules to increase the cost of risk at all of the lenders it rates: ComBank, Sampath Bank, HNB and NDB.
Industry insiders say the outcome of all of this change will be a wave of mergers  something that has been predicted for a long time but has so far failed to materialize.
Other problems stand out too, each presenting its own headache to lenders large and small.
Net interest margins and returns are falling across the sector, with Exotix tipping average industry return on equity to fall to 14.3% in 2019, from 17.1% in 2017.
Digital disruption has also finally arrived on the island. Local telco Dialog Axiata paid just over SLRs1 billion for an 80% stake in Colombo Trust Finance, a non-bank financial institution, in September 2017, and will use the acquisition to expand into digital financial services.
Euro Money says that it is one more thing for Sri Lankas embattled banks to worry about.

President Maithripala Sirisena addressing the Commonwealth Heads of Government Executive Sessions at Lancaster House in London yesterday said his Government will act with determination to usher a sustainable and secure future for the countrys people.
The President said Sri Lanka like other countries was striving to achieve a prosperous future through sustainable social and economic development and environmental protection.
President Sirisena went on to say that as an island nation, Sri Lanka was especially focusing on preserving and protecting its environment for the benefit of the future generations.
While noting that Sri Lanka occupies a strategic geographic location in the Indian Ocean, the President said his country was focusing to maximise this advantage to generate income and spur development at a time when Asia was playing an increasingly dominant role in the world economy.
He also said that Sri Lanka fully supports the Clean Ocean Alliance programme proposed by the United Kingdom. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Theresa May warmly welcomed the President when he arrived at Lancaster House for the Executive Sessions.

Ten things to know before going vegan
According to The Vegan Society, veganism is a "philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude - as far as is possible and practicable - all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose."
The definition goes on to add that veganism promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of humans, animals and the environment and in dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals. Veganism is a comprehensive lifestyle choice striving to avoid animal cruelty and exploitation.
Here are 10 things you need to know before going vegan.
1) Dont go vegan overnight, plan transition gradually: According to studies, the more gradually people transition to veganism, the more likely they are to stick to it. While it may be easier for vegetarians to make a quicker transition, those who are making the transition from animal protein, remember it's okay for it to take weeks or months until you're fully animal productfree.
2) Make one dietary change at a time: Take it step by step and break it up into big changes and smaller changes. Keep on making the changes according to comfort and do not abstain all at once.
3) Alternate big and small changes: Instead of taking huge leaps of faith, alternate it with smaller lifestyle changes. Giving up red meat may be a huge step, do not follow it with giving up something else you love, it might hamper you journey towards veganism. Small changes could include anything from having one meal a day which is completely vegan to cooking with beans a few times a week as an alternate protein source.
4) Going vegan doesn't guarantee weight loss: While vegans as a population are on average slimmer than non-vegans, a vegan diet does not guarantee weight loss.
5) Eat more beans: Beans are a great source of protein and fibers. A great step in transitioning to veganism is to replace a few meat-based meals with bean-based meals Chill with arbitrary dietary restrictions.
6) Seek out processed foods that remind you of the animal-based products: If you like eating something, have it. Because some of those veggie-based meats and cheeses make it easier to transition to veganism.
7) Find vegan friends: Being a lonely began could be difficult. Reach out to people with similar lifestyle choices and the transition could become that much easier.
8) Locate the vegan and vegan-friendly restaurants nearby. Chines Thai and Indian cuisine have great options: Figure out where vegan food is served nearby in case you want to treat yourself to something great from time to time.
9) Learn to order off menu: You might reach a restaurant with absolutely nothing vegan on menu, learn to ask if the chef will prepare something that suits your choice, they might just comply.
10) Take Vitamin B12 and make sure you are still consuming enough protein: Vitamin B12 is non-negotiable and all vegans should take. The only place it occurs naturally is in animal foods, so one needs to supplement it from pills. Most vegans can still get the protein they need without any animal products. Eat a cup of beans every day (or maybe more  a cup and a half or two  depending on the calories you need for your size and activity level). Also keep variety in what you eat and remember lots of plant-based foods are still high in protein.

Fund raising T20I v Windies on May 31:
Thisara to play for ICC World XI at Lords
ICC World T20 winners Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Malik and Thisara Perera were the first set of players to confirm their participation for the ICC World XI in a T20I against the Windies to be played at Lords on 31 May. The match is being organised to raise funds for stadia in the Caribbean that were badly damaged following Hurricanes Irma and Maria last year.
Afridi and Malik were part of the Pakistan squad that won the ICC World T20 2009 at Lords, while Perera was a member of the Sri Lanka side that lifted the silverware in Dhaka in 2014. The three World T20 winners will lend a lot of weight to the ICC World XI side which will see more names being added in what is expected to be a star-studded line-up led by Englands white-ball captain Eoin Morgan, who has already been confirmed to lead the side.
Thisara Perera said: Im privileged to have made the World XI side for a second time after having also played in the series against Pakistan in Lahore last year. Im looking forward to the match at Lords next month with great enthusiasm as this is one of those rare opportunities when you get to rub shoulders with the best in the world. To be playing alongside so many top players from different countries will definitely be a high point of my career.
Im also very happy because I have been given the opportunity to contribute in what I think is a very good cause. It is heartening to note that players have come together for helping rebuild stadia in the West Indies. The West Indies have contributed a lot to world cricket over the years and they deserve all support from our generation of players.
Shahid Afridi said: I am humbled to have been selected for such a noble cause. Cricket is one big family and no matter how hard and tough we play against each other, there is tremendous camaraderie within the group. As such, it is our moral and professional obligation to stand up and support whenever and wherever we can, to assist our members, colleagues and cricket fans.
Shoaib Malik said: Its a matter of great honour and pride to be selected in an ICC World XI and a wonderful opportunity to play along with and against some of the biggest names in world cricket. As much as the chance of figuring in such a select group, I also see this as an opportunity to contribute in a meaningful cause.
Carlos Brathwaite-led Windies too are a strong side boasting big names like Chris Gayle, Marlon Samuels, Samuel Badree and Andre Russell and will be looking to give off their best and show the might that helped them win the ICC World Twenty20 title two years ago.
The match is being staged to raise funds to rebuild and restore five major cricket venues at the heart of Caribbean communities that were damaged by Hurricanes Irma and Maria.
The tickets for the match are now on sale at https://tickets.lords.org/ with all proceeds going towards rebuilding and renovating these major venues as well as other community cricket facilities. The venues that will benefit include the Ronald Webster Park in Anguilla, the Sir Viv Richards Stadium in Antigua, the Windsor Park Stadium in Dominica, the A.O.

Those obstructing govts progress have left - Navin
Minister of Plantation Industries Navin Dissanayake said that the people who were plotting against the government have already left and the UNP has strengthened itself to provide a better service to the people.
He said that he was thankful to those who moved out of the government.
Participating at a New Year celebration in Hanguranketha, Minister Dissanayake said that the people who were obstructing the progress of the government are no more and therefore they can march forward peacefully.
I sent an SMS to a minister who opposed the Prime Minister to leave the government if they do not like it; they need not remain with the government criticising the Prime Minister and the government. And finally they resigned from their portfolios, he said. The minister said that he was able to gain more support when the secret ballot was called to set up the UNP politburo and added that it was possible due to the prevailing strong democracy within the party.
I am the only Sinhalese minister in the cabinet representing the Nuwara Eliya district; therefore I have a huge responsibility. And I have also been able to be part of the UNP politburo. The UNP is the only party that called for four secret ballots to set up the politburo. That was possible only because of the internal democracy within the party, he said.
He further said that UNP had a secret ballot two weeks before as well and it was he who got the majority support of the party.
Minister Dissanayake added that the votes showed the stance of the UNP MPs in the party. I have a great responsibility and I will take every necessary initiative to strengthen the party, he said.
The minister further said that people taught them a good lesson during the local government elections and the government has 18 months to deliver better service to the public.
He said that considering the response of the public, the government has taken initiatives to make appropriate changes.
We are discussing how to reform the party. In the coming six months people could expect many changes to happen. The government has allocated Rs. 50 billion for the betterment of the public and several subsidies will be granted for them, he said.

Thoughts on life: Be aware of your thoughts
Life is a creation of Mother Nature. Created by the three elements, solids, liquids and air together and nourished by the same obtained from nature and finally perished to be with the same elements is the stark truth of what we call life.
Although we cling so much to this dear life, calling my, mine, nothing happens physically the way we want. Happiness, unhappiness, deceases and pleasures come to us in their own accord although we think we are in control of them. We are like logs going with the current of a river flowing towards its own end. Our minds are tricked by the momentary pleasure of the six senses.
Although pain and unhappiness come, in a moment the sweet oblivion of forgetfulness drives us towards deceptive pleasure transforming us to that situation. This series of pains and pleasures are accepted as life. People go on closing their eyes and most of all the power to understand
and realise the true nature of things around us in ignorance.
To drive a vehicle one does not need to learn the technology of the engine. One does not need to study medical science to know that there are ninety eight ailments that could be affected with this body one time or other.
Developing one's mind with human intelligence, based on right knowledge is the only answer to bring solace to this life form, without being a victim of innumerable, unwanted collection of wrong deeds that is led to painful results in a cycle of birth and rebirth.
Many points conducted today simply have no impact on transforming the mind from the dark elements greed, hatred and illusion that is simply chained with every thought, word and deed.
The true effort of cleansing ones own mind with the right effort of not being victim to these three elements that control all our thoughts, words and deeds need to be understood with a sound mind. Maintaining that Sound mind every moment is a mammoth task.
Be aware of all thoughts trying to see as they truly are, is the technique. In this process one removes immense dross, the mind is covered with, and transform one's life like a lotus sprung from the mud and maintain the mind with the beauty and serenity like a lotus above water, not being a victim of mind produced, mind driven wrong channels of greed, hatred and illusion that either clings you to the situation or in conflict with the situation, two things that happen every moment with every thought.
Life starts with birth on the road to death in ever degrading body even though, you fantasize during youth as if life is an eternal summer. Adding to it is the material achievement of man creating an illusory life simply blindfolded. A luxury vehicle, cloths and vivid gadgets further take you in this dungeon.
When you look at your own self and everything around you your intelligence can understand the responsible factor of your own doing, whether a thought, a word or action and solve the puzzle that when you remove the reason linked to your action, you become free to understand your own doings and not let them recur again. The correct awareness of mind is the first step we need to cultivate to cleanse the mind and leading to a state of mind able to see things as they truly are!
Unconscious living is what most of us are accustomed. This identity of `me and mine is part of nature that is created with the three elements solids, liquids and air. But the intelligence presented in this physical brain or mind is supreme for both constructive and destructive efforts. When the mind is constantly purified with correct awareness trying to live in the present moment, seeing what goes in the mind and react accordingly, no powers of Mara can fathom your territory.
This sequence need to be understood by every intelligent human being irrespective of one's standing in life whether a carpenter or engineer, doctor or a farmer. This simple learning is for all. The right effort and genuineness is what one need to cultivate. Train your mind to watch your thoughts even for five minutes.
Consciously to see what enters your mind, activates in your mind and the created result accompanied makes sure that you are on the right path. This preliminary training of five minutes would help your mind capture all you do in a day, to put everything to the right basket, creating right results, giving you the ultimate freedom from human suffering in this process sometimes in this life itself, saying no to all unconscious living and bringing unimaginable peace of mind to yourself unshattered among great turmoil this current world is today.

UK aid to combat human trafficking
The United Kingdom is proposing more aid to Commonwealth countries including Sri Lanka to combat human trafficking.
The UK Home Office said Wednesday that Sri Lanka would have access to a new, more than two million pound package to strengthen law enforcement and support new legislation.
This is a global problem which requires a global response, which is why all countries must unite to end this to make these brutal crimes will be a thing of the past, said British Home Secretary Amber Rudd in a statement. To that end, the UK continues to work with our Commonwealth neighbours to strengthen their response to human trafficking and child exploitation, she said.
Two million pounds will be allocated to strengthen law enforcement and justice systems in fighting human trafficking in India, Sri Lanka, Malawi and Zambia, the Home Office release said.
Another 500,000 pounds will support tough new legislation to combat human trafficking and forced labour in Ghana, Nigeria, Pakistan, Uganda, Bangladesh, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, and Sri Lanka,the release added. Also at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting this week, British Prime Minister Theresa May said that she deeply regretted the legacy of colonial laws criminalising homosexuality. Nobody should face discrimination or persecution because of who they are or who they love, she said.
I am all too aware that these laws were often put in place by my own country, she added.
They were wrong then and they are wrong now.
She urged countries like Sri Lanka to update their outdated anti-gay laws to ensure equality for all people.

Ways that saved Rs. 10 bn. in 2006  for two State Banks
The date December 26, 2004 would be remembered by almost all Sri Lankans, a Sunday, Unduwap Full Moon Poya Day, Boxing Day to Christians; Sri Lanka was playing cricket against New Zealand there. The time was about 10.30 a.m. I had finished my prayers and was reading pages 799-801of the Treasury of Truth by Rev. Weragoda Sarada Thera. This book was an English translation of the Dhammapada with paintings and I used to read a few pages every Sunday. This day I was going through a very important section which explained how one could extend loving kindness to others in 480 different ways. A few months before this, a leftist politician was querying how a Sinhalese Buddhist could extend his or her meritorious thoughts or loving kindness towards V. Prabhakaran, LTTE leader who was responsible for death of hundreds of thousands of people, including the President of Sri Lanka and Prime Minister of India. I thought this page answered that question and I started to practice it daily covering 40 different ways every day. All of a sudden, I heard a big rumpus from the upstairs living area where they were watching the cricket match. My two daughters-in-law were trying to contact their parents to find out how they were, as a tsunami had struck the south-western coast line bringing unimaginable havoc to the entire area.

The World Bank (WB) also came to our aid offering us assistance to build houses. The programme was called Owner Driven Housing Programme as the responsibility of carrying out construction was thrust upon owners themselves. WB offered Rs. 250,000 to owners of houses which were fully damaged and Rs. 100.000 for those houses which were partially damaged. The criteria for the demarcation was provided by the WB.
TAFREN and housing grants
There were about 54,000 beneficiaries who submitted applications for aid successfully. They were from 22 Divisions along the coast line from Wadamarachchi, Mullaitivu, Batticaloa. Tissamaharama, Galle upto Kalutara. They fulfilled conditions required like (a) house was damaged due to tsunami, (b) house was built on own property and (c) it was built outside 2 km bufferzone which was announced by the government.
Arrangement put forward by WB was that they would give 25% of the funding required for the total beneficiary population and balance 75% of funding had to be provided by two state banks, Bank of Ceylon and Peoples Bank. The beneficiaries had to submit their applications to the Divisional Secretariat and the Secretariat had to maintain a Damage Assessment File (DAT) for each beneficiary. The funds were provided in three or four instalments depending on level of damage and progress made.
Balance 75% of money paid by state banks would be reimbursed by WB only when a 100% Beneficiary Verification Audit (BVA) was carried out and only in respect of those who were found to be eligible. The 25% funds already received from WB for those ineligible beneficiaries will be deducted from the 75% of the balance funds identified for eligible beneficiaries. While the Divisional Secretariats maintained DAT files, two State Banks maintained all details about beneficiaries and payments made in their computer systems.
Beneficiary verification audit
It was early 2006 and TAFREN announced their need for the BVA and put a newspaper advertisement. WB had already spelt out conditions for the BVA as follows:
(i) Audit had to be carried out in all 22 divisional Secretariat areas concurrently and completed within 2 months.
(ii) Audit had to ensure that the identity of beneficiary was right, ownership was established, etc. using the DAT file
(iii) Audit had also to be carried out at the house to ensure that the damage was due to Tsunami, it was of the right type -partial or full damage  and person identification was matching.
The audit conditions were tough; but it did not deter us from looking at ways and means of carrying it out within the specific time period.
Having had experience in carrying out consultancy assignments to cover wide areas and mastered the art of doing audits we decided to quote for the assignment. The directors carved out different aspects of the assignment - Arjuna  Risk based consultancy person undertook to carryout a comprehensive Risk Assessment of the project, Dushantha  IT in-charge, worked out a detailed road map for use of IT services from converting Data Base to be received from two banks to the report template expected by TAFFREN, Theekshana prepared the manpower plan, Indrani  logistics, office equipment framework and I worked on the strategy to be adopted to collect information at the two locations  location of the House and Divisional Secretariat Office  without making it known as to who and who would get disqualified at the respective locations. Arjuna made full use of his experience in preparing 43 tobacco collection centers of Pakistan Tobacco Company along with Islamabad Head Office and two factories at Jhelum and Akorakhattak for SA 8000 certification in exactly three months, reasonably fresh in his mind and prepared a detailed Risk Treatment Plan. We were very confident that we could do it successfully in time allocated and we submitted the only quotation on closing date of the tender.
TAFREN decided to call for fresh quotations and the name of the organisation had already being changed from TAFREN to RADA (Reconstruction and Development Agency).
We again responded with our proposal and information we received was that an Australian consultancy firm had quoted to carry out the audit in series starting with Kalutara and moving along the coastline to Vadamarachchi, while a Sri Lankan audit firm had quoted to do a sample of 5% of population. So naturally we were awarded the assignment and real-time challenges started popping up.
Preliminary arrangements
While agreements were been prepared, bank guarantees arranged, transport arrangements were been made. I met Prof. S. Perera, at the University of Sri Jayawardhenapura and arranged to obtain about 40 graduands of the university to cover the Galle District. She agreed to arrange for graduands to be ready to go to Ambalangoda and stay there and carry out the audit. When I met her, there was one V. Subramaniam  another graduand  from Jaffna and he responded positively to my request for support in organizing the Vadamarachchi and Mullaitivu locations. He arranged for us to use Dr. K. Rajendran of Jaffna University to overlook audits in Vadamarachchi and Mullaitivu Divisional Secretariat areas. A nephew of mine arranged some young persons from Moratuwa to carryout the audit in Kalutara district and another relation arranged two retired school teachers and two young school leavers to handle the smaller Tissamaharama. The only area left out was Batticaloa and its surrounding areas. K. Pathmanathan former Governor of Rotary came to my rescue by suggesting that I contact M. Vinayagamurthy, former President of Rotary Club of Batticaloa. He agreed to be my co-ordinator in Batticaloa and agreed to provide required number of field staff and remained to be a tower of strength throughout. Prof. S.S. Colombage at the Open University introduced Dr. S.C. Chandrabose  a lecturer at the Open University  to help me in communicating with Batticaloa and Jaffna.
I had already prepared a key factor to success of the project  the questionnaire to be used for the purpose. It consisted of two parts of an A4 sheet  upper part to be used at Divisional Secretariat to verify the person, ownership, addresses and lower part to be used at location of the house to verify (a) level of damage and (b) that damage has been due to Tsunami. Two parts were used by two persons and these were brought separately to our office in Colombo to match and file. The two parts were filed one above the other in the same file and there was a separate file for each Grama Sevaka Division.
Then we prepared material for the training program. We had modules covering, General Introduction, Auditing Methodology, Legal Aspects related to land ownership, Structural Engineering aspects related to partial and full damage and Logistics, issue resolution methodology. The next step was to take the selected auditors for Kalutara, Galle and Tissamaharama districts and conduct the training program at Ambalangoda.
In the meantime we had received two CDs from Bank of Ceylon and Peoples Bank containing all the data corresponding to the beneficiaries; Dushshantha had developed a program to convert data in these two CDs to fill data slots assigned in the individual data collection sheets. Corresponding to each beneficiary there were two partially filled forms to be filled up at the Divisional Secretariat office and at the damaged house.
On a Sunday morning, we went to Ambalangoda with Prof. Mrs. Perera and Mahesh Fernando  my pupil at Trinity and then an experienced, qualified Structural Engineer to carry out the Training. Between us, we explained everything about the audit  overall methodology, how to verify land ownership, how to decide level of damage, logistics, how to collect forms to carryout the audit and handover completed forms to be dispatched to our office. In the late afternoon we carried out a mock audit and everything seemed fine.
But at the end of the third day, there resulted resentment on the arrangement and team from the university was not happy on a few issues. They had expected to carry out a survey where they would go to a damaged house and fill up a form completely with names, addresses, etc. and not to fill up blanks in a semi filled format. They said that with partially filled format, it is difficult to find the location and the beneficiary.
So, Prof. Mrs. Perera and I left for Ambalangoda and summoned the teams to where the girls stayed. We explained urgency of audit and the way it is planned is the best way and the quickest way and if we dont finish it on time, the country would lose a significant amount of money. They understood our viewpoint and settled down and went ahead with the audit.
We got the training handouts translated by a translator at the Open University and we set about the training in Batticaloa. Dr. Chandrabose managed to get some undergraduates at the Eastern University through a friend of his called A.H. Mohamed and we went to Batticaloa and organized the set up. Dr. Chandrabose helped us by ensuring that the completed forms arrived in our office without any comparisons been done in respective locations.
We then diverted our attention to Jaffna area and sent necessary training material to Dr. Rajendran. He and Subaramaniam conducted one training program for Vadamarachchi in Jafffna and one for Mullaitivu in Kilinochchi and initiated audits.
Once we had finished our initial planning and first training at Ambalangoda we prepared the Inception Report which contained our team structure, map of our process flow and Data Collection Sheet and basic time frames. We were summoned for a meeting with E. Narayan  Team Lead from the World Bank and we explained our methodology and the Data Collection Sheet. He was very happy with the arrangements.
Processing of data sheets
Once the data sheets were received at our office, they were filed carefully in a separate file for each Grama Sevaka Division and two parts corresponding to a single beneficiary were filed with DS Division format above Householder Location form in the same sequence. We could readily identify any missing forms and initiate suitable action to get a new data sheet generated. Then these data were entered into a software generated. But final processing which would yield lists of eligible and rejected beneficiaries was not initiated till all data corresponding to a Grama Sevaka division was received.
We were summoned for another meeting with Narayana in mid October, 2006 and we went for the meeting. We also carried with us two files - reasonably thick corresponding to two GS Divisions in Galle and Batticaloa. Representatives from the audit firm which was carrying out the 5% Financial Audit were already there discussing with the World Bank team here, representatives from RADA and Narayan and they were engrossed in a discussion about the Audit. They were saying that they were unable to do the audit at Kaluwanchikudy as the beneficiaries were restless and not cooperating. This prompted Narayan to ask whether we had done Kaluwanchikudy and fortunately one of the files we had taken belonged to Kaluwanchikudy. So I presented the file and said it had all the completed forms corresponding to the DS Office and location of the house filed one below the other in the right order. Probably, the beneficiaries got to know that they might get disqualified for the receipt of the grant and they may not have been cooperating with the financial auditors. Anyhow they were very happy that we had all the relevant data and ready to select the beneficiaries for the majority of divisions in Galle, Kalutara, Batticaloa and Tissamaharama districts.
Based on the progress we have demonstrated, we got another three similar assignments  in Batticaloa in respect of KFW Bank funding, in Trincomalee in respect of ADB Funding and a smaller version of WB assignment of ICRC Funding and the total number of householders rose to about 74,000.
With about 75% of completed forms received at the office, we started processing and identifying the beneficiaries  both qualified and disqualified. The individual answers corresponding to different questions had already been entered into the system and results in respect of the DS Office part were not visible to those who were entering the other results.
These entered data were subjected to a quality check using a software and then the total set of results available were analysed using another software to yield the final Eligible Beneficiaries List. We always reminded ourselves that any mistake on our part could lead to a Divisional Secretary having to explain a shortcoming on his part and the country losing Rs. 250,000 in foreign exchange. We had to create these beneficiary lists separately for each Divisional Secretariat Area.
When we ran that software, 14% of the beneficiaries whose data sheets were completed disqualified and half of them were disqualified for the reason that the houses were built within the buffer zone. When this was brought to the notice of Narayan he suggested that we disregard that requirement and we eliminated it from our software. We believe this indicated that they  World Bank  had no intention of depriving us of the benefit of the grant.
While we were doing these, Narayan also carried out a sample audit with a small team and compared these results. Out of all these 74,000 beneficiary files subjected to the audit, they had come across only one file in that sample audit in need of an explanation from us. There was one beneficiary  a chairman of a local government body  who had submitted four applications and we had rejected three and approved only one and the question was that what he built did not look like a house. We responded by saying that the World Bank guidelines for the grant had not spelt out a specification of a house to be verified and it ended there.
We managed to complete the audit and Government of Sri Lanka obtained the grant money for about 93% of the original beneficiaries who benefitted and we feel very happy that the two public sector Banks  Bank of Ceylon and Peoples Bank recovered the money they had distributed which would have amounted to more than Rupees Ten Billion.
Consultancy
I always used to wonder what would have happened if we did not quote for that Beneficiary Verification Audit. It may be that the Australian consultancy would have got the job  WB having agreed to the arrangement--and they may have tried to do it in the sequential manner they had proposed. Then if what happened at Kaluwanchikudy was any indication, it may have come across a few stumbling blocks on the way. Would it have deprived us of the benefit of that much needed grant
The success of our endeavour, I believe, depended on a few things:
(a) Presence of a dedicated team in Prof. (Mrs) Perera, Drs. Chandrabose and Rajendran, Messrs. Vinayagamurthy and Mohamed, Structural Engineer Mahesh Fernando and Lawyer Thushari and of course the four directors, Indrani, Arjuna, Dushshantha and Theekshana. Each one of them may have solved many a problem which I never came to know so that I could always concentrate on the Big Picture.
(b) Then there was this team of about 1250 persons from different parts of Sri Lanka who participated in the audit and each one of them carried out his or her task without creating unnecessary problems.
(c) Then that questionnaire sheet which beautifully served the purpose and kept key sensitive information adequately confidential throughout the process and the software which maintained that confidentiality even during data processing.
(d) The mode of operation of separating the audits at DS Office and Location of the house and keeping relevant information confidential throughout. Or was it luck bestowed upon me by the fact that I practiced very religiously the 480 ways of extending loving kindness to all living beings in all parts of Sri Lanka from the day of the Tsunami onwards which made all these four things happen simultaneously.
But the more important aspect is how we, people from different (a) parts of the country, (b) communities and (c) religious backgrounds co-operated and managed to save Rs. 10 billion in 2006 for Mother Sri Lanka.

We will cooperate with UNP chairman for Mahiyanganas benefit - SLFP
Fostering transparency and accountability and team spirit will be vital for our success, chief SLFP organizer for Mahiyangana K.P. Gunawardhana said, at a meeting of the Mahiyangana Pradeshiya Sabha recently.
Gunawardhana, who is also a local government member in the Badulla district, said that those who were in power and have now been in the political wilderness for their wrongdoings do not seem to repent, much less learn from their blunders.
It is our duty to work for the benefit of the local public, ensuring transparency and accountability in the projects carried out by us. The politicians who are shedding copious tears for the people of Mahiyangana should answer the question as to why they abused power and earned unconscionably high profits by utilising community properties unlawfully, if their concerns about Mahiyangana are genuine.
As Sri Lanka is an established democracy, everybody should stick to the law, not merely to the letter of the law, but also through concrete action of the judiciary, he said.
And the yahapaalana government has done a lot of work toward this end. He said that the wrongdoers of Mahiyangana wouldnt have had to swallow their pride and grovel before an independent group which entered the fray during the February 10 polls, if they had done their duties properly while compiling the list of nominations for the local government elections. As well as at the poll, they had to feel frustrated at their lack of progress at the inaugural meeting of the new Mahiyangana Pradeshiya Sabha where they failed to grab the much expected first seat there - it went to an eligible person.
R. M. Karu Weeraratna who was appointed to the chairmanship of the 6th Mahiyangana Pradeshiya Sabha, was the chairman of the local government body of Rideemaaliyadda Pradeshiya Sabha in the Mahiyangana electorate previously, Gunawardhana said.
Although he is from the United National Party (UNP), the four of us from SLFP will cooperate with him for the benefit of Mahiyangana, he said.
