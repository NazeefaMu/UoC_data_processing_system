Chamari Athapaththu: delivering hope to SL Women's team
She hit her maiden ODI century at the age of 21, which is, till date, the highest individual score in the 50-over format for her country. At 23, in the 2013 Cricket World Cup, her quickfire fifty against England helped her team script one of the most remarkable upsets in the history of Sri Lankan women's cricket. She was 24 when the national selectors chose to name her as the captain of a side that consisted of senior stars like Shashikala Siriwardene and Eshani Lokusuriyage. By 26, she has established herself as a pivot around which the Sri Lankan batting revolves. Despite tasting success at an early age, Chamari Athapaththu, stand-in skipper of the Sri Lankan Women's team at the 2016 ICC World Twenty20, feels her best is yet to come.
Cricket for her started at the tender age of five. Not by choice, though. Pushed into the game by her cricket-crazy father and uncle, Athapaththu didn't enjoy the sport as much as her friends did. Eventually, she did develop an interest and it soon became a part of her daily routine.
A Public Health Inspector, Athapaththu's father motivated his only child to consider a career in cricket. So that his 'lazy' child wouldn't complain, the father religiously dropped her to the training and picked her back up in evenings. That her uncle, Chandra Dissanayaka was a coach helped her get the basics in place in a city where there were not enough facilities for girls back in the day.
Once her performances at the school and district level started to get noticed, Colts Cricket Club signed up the young all-rounder and Athapaththu had to leave her former side Kurunegala Cricket Club, and the city to move to Colombo - a three-hour ride from her home and parents.
When Athapaththu started training in Colombo, her coach Harsha de Silva spotted the aggressive trait in her batting. Instinctively, he promoted the prodigious pupil to bat up in the order instead of her regular No. 7 position. Soon enough, despite the presence of a bunch of established openers in their ranks, young Athapaththu's raw power helped her seal a spot in the club's opening combination.
When the runs started flowing in, the fast bowler in Athapaththu phased out, and the 26-year-old has no regrets.
Years of hard work paid off when Athapaththu found her name amongst the 14-member squad for the upcoming Asia Cup at home in 2008. The celebrations at home were short lived, though. A week before her much-anticipated national debut, Athapaththu lost her father to a heart attack. "That was a really tough time for me. He is my hero. He inspired me to take up cricket, but his passing was heartbreaking," Athapaththu told Cricbuzz in an exclusive chat.
All of 18, Athapaththu withdrew her name from the squad and took an indefinite break to be with her mother. A retired nurse, the mother made her choose cricket when Athapaththu decided against leaving her back alone in their home town.
Two months later, backed by her mother's motivation, Athapaththu resumed training in Colombo. Subsequently, she made her international debut at the 2009 ICC Women's World Twenty20 in England, and three days after her return, the Ibbagamuwa Central College student wrote her graduation exams. She is now a commerce graduate.
Even today, as the five-day-a-week practice routine continues for all members of the national team at the Max Cricket Academy in the R Premadasa Stadium premises, Athapathathu can spare only weekends for her mother. "We have a lot of inheritance back home and she looks after it. Also, she doesn't enjoy the city life in Colombo," said Athapaththu. It is 11 in the night usually by the time she makes it home on Friday nights after training.
Since losing her role model her father, Athapaththu's mother has been her pillar of support. So much so that going against the cultural norms, she has shielded her cricketer daughter from the extended family who have wanted Athapaththu to quit the game and settle down. "People don't really encourage cricket as a career, especially for girls. There are pressures to get married and have kids, but she backs me a lot," Athapaththu remarked.
Nuwan Zoysa, the current assistant coach of the Sri Lankan Women's team, likened her to one of the greatest destructive openers Matthew Hayden, but Athapaththu says her idol growing up was Sri Lanka's original maestro, Sanath Jayasuriya. "I loved watching Jayasuriya play. At the start of my career, I used to try copying him, but now, I have my own style of batting."
By her own admission, Athapaththu lost her touch just when the World T20 was around the corner. As a senior batter and vice-captain, the onus has been on her to get the team off to an explosive start in powerplay.
The one week in between their last bilateral fixtures, against India in Ranchi in February, and time they flew out again for the mega event was spent rectifying the mistakes. Her numbers 89 from 3 outings including top scores of 34 and 38 against Ireland and Australia respectively reflect the amount of hard work that went into regaining lost confidence.
Honing her skills alongside Shashikala Siriwardene, current captain and inarguably the best women cricketer to emerge from the island nation, has been a great learning experience for Athapaththu, she admitted. "We grew up playing together, she's been my inspiration, and to a lot of others, I am sure.
"We learn a lot under her. Her captaincy is quite aggressive, but otherwise she is very calm. I have learnt a lot under her (as a vice-captain). She has immense respect for other players and their ideas," Athapaththu, who was handed the reigns of the team after a hamstring injury forced Srirwardene out of the ongoing World T20, added.
"Her absence was a huge loss for us. Losing an experienced player and a captain like her (in the middle of an important tournament) was not easy for my team."
Despite the advantage of knowing the subcontinental conditions better than a majority of the teams at the World T20, Sri Lanka's campaign ended prematurely. But rather than dwelling on the past that can't be changed, Athapaththu is keen to improve on the team's shortcomings before the 2017 ICC Women's World Cup comes knocking.
"Our openers batted very well to give us good starts, but we didn't quite execute as well in the death overs. (When we go back,) we'll work on getting singles, rotating the strike and pacing our innings. Fielding and bowling lapses cost us heavily. We could have saved some 15-20 runs more, I feel."
Since the Sri Lanka Cricket Board took charge, one of the biggest gains for the women's game has been the opportunity to train at the same state-of-the-art academy as the men's side. The coaching sessions from Lasith Malinga and Mahela Jayawardene come as an added bonus.
While the scenario back home is changing for the better from the time she first picked up a bat, Athapaththu admits that this Sri Lankan team has a long way to go before the women attain the same status as the men's side.
"To get (that kind of) fame, we need to win a tournament. We have been good in the shorter formats of the game, but not consistent. We didn't click as a unit in this World Cup, which was our main failure. "We have a good foundation now. School cricket is encouraged, and then there are various age-level tournaments as well as club cricket. Girls are now considering the game as a career option," Athapaththu, who hails from the same city as Rangana Herath, noted.
"We have plenty of potential in our side, but we need game-experience. The likes of Shashikala have some solid international experience behind them. By the time the next 50-over World Cup comes up, we should be able to build a good team, hopefully," she signed off on a positive note.
There could be thousands of Chamari Athapaththus hidden in the wondrous places of Sri Lanka. Athapaththu rose above social stigma and family pressures to lead the Sri Lankan Women's team at the ICC World T20. Here's hoping her story reaches out to many such women and opens doors to the joys of sport.

Australia's woes in WT20 were self-inflicted, reckons Kim Hughes
Australia should be "bitterly disappointed" with their early exit at the World T20 and they made a major blunder not using David Warner as an opener, according to Kim Hughes, former Australia captain.
Hughes, who captained Australia in 27 Tests from 1979-84, believed most of Australia's problems throughout an erratic World T20 campaign were self-inflicted. "Australia should be bitterly disappointed because it was a lost opportunity," Hughes told Cricbuzz on Tuesday (March 29).
"They weren't outclassed in the matches they lost but they got things wrong and ultimately that was costly. The wicket in Mohali was excellent and suited Australia, but they were 20 runs short of what they should have posted."
Hughes said he was baffled that Warner did not bat in his preferred opener's position, as Australia opted to use their vice-captain at No. 3 or 4 in the order. "Australia got it wrong with Warner the whole way through the tournament," he said.
"Warner is like Chris Gayle, he is the team's most destructive batsman and is better from the get go when the ball is new and hard. The opposition teams would have been breathing a sigh of relief knowing Warner was not opening."
Australia's top-order was not utilised to maximum effect, according to Hughes.
"Warner and (Aaron) Finch are Australia's most destructive batsmen and should have been opening," he said. "(Usman) Khawaja is an artist but he is not a bludgeoner. He is like their (Virat) Kohli and should have batted at three. The middle-order really struggled and that was meant to be the strength of the team."
In the aftermath of Australia's six-wicket loss to India at Mohali, most of the criticism was directed at captain Steve Smith's refusal to bowl out leg-spinner Adam Zampa, who had starred against Bangladesh and Pakistan but only bowled two overs for 11 runs against India. Hughes said criticism of Smith was unwarranted and believed most of the attention should be focused on Kohli's masterly performance.
"It is easy for us to criticise a captain but he's really the only one who knows what is happening out in the middle," he said. "Smith and (Darren) Lehmann would have had a strategy and in hindsight they could have done things differently but at the end of the day Australia were still in the box seat with three overs left in the match. I don't think there has been a better T20 innings than that one by Kohli." Australia has four years to stew over their World T20 disappointment but Hughes believed the future was still bright. "Australia still has a relatively young core and you would think a lot of the team will still be around in 2020," he said. "Australia really missed Mitchell Starc, who is the best paceman in the world in this format and Pat Cummins is another quick who could make a big difference if he is fit."
With the next World T20 set to be staged in Australia for the first time, the pressure will be undoubtedly on the hosts to break their frustrating drought. Hughes said Australia needed to analyse their T20 performances and take heed from the lessons learned. "I think Australia really need a left-arm orthodox spinner and Jon Holland, for example, is one such player doing well in Sheffield Shield cricket," he said. "Australia just haven't played enough in this format. To play just one T20 last year is ludicrous. Some of the main core of the squad don't even play Big Bash because they have international duties.
"The best teams like New Zealand and India look more settled. Australia's planning needs to be far better."

Former Trinity College ruggerite Iswan Omar who won his colors in 1967 and the Lion in 1969 was elected the new president of the CPRFU (Central Province Rugby Football Union) at the AGM held at the Kandy Sports Club house on Sunday.
As a schoolboy he played for Kandy S.C. in 1969. Later he sported the Kandy Lake Club, Kandy RFC, Uva, Dimbulla A & CC, Dickoya MCC and Up-Country colors and was in the National pool but had to step out of the scrum due to a knee injury. Kandy's ruggerites are happy over his appointment. As in the past as secretary and the first time as president he did a good job and so the same can be expected from him this time too.
The two best ever presidents CPRFU were fortunate to have seen in rugby promotion was none other than Iswan Omar who returns and late Maurice Perera.

Today rugby is the biggest spectator sport in Kandy and this game has become the city's national game and everyone appreciates it very much.
It shows the love and interest for the game. Many remember the glorious moments of the club and off all the names, the one that readily comes to mind is the man who promoted the game, to achieve great heights not seen in the long history of the club and he is none other than former Royal, CR and FC and Sri Lanka scrumhalf Malik Samarawickrema who with his onerous duties as Minister took time to steer the club to its present status at rugby.
This season in the league Kandy SC became unbeaten champions. When the history of rugby is written at Nittawela and the controlling body, the name of Malik Samarawickrema will be written in letters of gold and will stand out as one if not the greatest administrator the sport has had.

## Title: Messi's boots make Egyptians cry foul

Messi's boots make Egyptians cry foul
The world's most famous footballer donates a pair of his boots to a charity auction, what's not to like Plenty it seems, depending on the cultural context, as Barcelona star Lionel Messi has been discovering after his generous gesture managed to upset some Egyptians.
It was only a few weeks ago that Messi was widely praised for making a young fan's dream come true when he sent a shirt and a football to a young Afghan boy - a story in which BBC Trending played a small role.
However, when the player made a similarly well-intentioned gift on Egyptian TV this week it was regarded by some as a national insult. During a TV interview with the "Yes I am Famous" show, broadcast on MBC's Misr Channel, the Argentine footballer told the presenter he would like to donate his football boots to be auctioned off for charity.
What Messi seems to have failed to appreciate is that in Egypt and other Arab countries in the region shoes can be used as a symbol of disrespect or insult. So some Egyptians took offence and turned to social media to express their anger.
"This is the most disgusting. He was paid thousands of dollars and at the end he donated his shoes and the stupid presenter was happy," tweeted one user called @Sala77ar7ash. Another user called @sulimanahmad670 commented: "Egypt's name is greater than Messi's shoes. This is a big insult to Egypt," wrote @sulimanahmad670.
In Arab culture, showing the soles of your shoes can be seen as especially insulting. The Arabic expression "to hit someone with a shoe" is offensive. You might remember the case of Iraqi journalist Muntasir al-Zaydi, who threw his shoes at President George W Bush in protest at a press conference in Baghdad in 2008.
The shoe can be considered dirty because it is on the ground and associated with the foot, the lowest part of the body. So some people have taken issue with the fact the TV presenter, Mona al-Sharqawi held Messi's donated boots with her hands. "Wake up Arabs and smell the coffee. No time for sleeping. She [the presenter] should have refused this insignificant donation," tweeted @awatifalqaisey.
In response to the perceived insult, Egyptian MP Said Hasasin who presents a programme called "Infirad" (Exclusive) on private Al-Asimah TV, went so far as to take off his shoes on air saying he would donate them to Messi.
But opponents of Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi also seized on the situation as a way to attack the government. A hashtag which translates as "Messi's_shoes_to_AlSisi's_people" has been used more than 15,000 times.
The pro-Muslim Brotherhood "Rabi'ah's Pulse" Facebook page published a video of the presenter receiving Messi's shoes' donation and wrote: "It is not only an insult to Egypt, but rather humiliation to the military gang that killed the innocent and kidnapped President [Muhammad] Morsi."
However, some wondered why the president's name was being linked to the issue. "Why you put Al-Sisi in anything happening" one Twitter user @moody7amada wondered.
