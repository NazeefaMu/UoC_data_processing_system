The Sri Lanka Army Signal Corps is in the process of developing a method of preventing cheating at examinations using mobile phones and other communication equipment,Army Commander Lt. Gen Mahesh Senanayake said.
He was speaking during a ceremony marking the 75th Anniversary of the Signal Corps.
I have instructed the Signal Corps to come up with a strategy and they are working on it. The people have great expectations about the Army and it is our bound duty to provide them the best service. We have sought the expertise of other countries in developing out knowledge on cyber security and we export our knowledge too. We are not the same army that existed in the 1980s we have to be prepared to face the future and take on new challenges, he noted.
The Army Commander highlighted the important role played by the Signal Corps in the present day context, accounting information as the fifth dimension of the modern warfare.

Best foot forward
For some, easy and graceful movements come naturally. Once you find your groove, nurturing a love for music and enjoying rhythmical movements everyday come with great value. This allows them to foster their sense of physical expressions and spark creativity.
The dance troupe of Lyceum International School Nugegoda recently took part in the International Dance Festival and Competition which was held in Moscow, Russia, recently. They won first place in the traditional folk dance category for the two dance items they presented at the event. The Lyceum Nugegoda dance team comprised of 19 students. They presented a Sword Dance and Lee Keli item at the competition. The Sword Dance also managed to bag the highest award, Best of the Best Dance.
Around 250 dance teams from 30 western countries competed at the International Dance Festival and Competition this year. All the participants were from schools across the globe. The stage was set for around 2500 students to showcase their dancing skills. Lyceum Nugegoda representing Sri Lanka was the only South Asian school which was present at the event.

The International Dance Festival and Competition is basically an interschool competition which has been introduced to bring the dancing skills of the youth onto a global platform. Many Russian schools as well as schools from western countries took part in the event. This was the first time that Lyceum International Nugegoda took part in the event, explained Lyceum Group Chief Coordinator of Cultural Dancing Rasika Kothalawala.
Lyceum Nugegoda Dancing Coordinator Nisha Kothalawala noted that the dance items were designed in a manner so that the international dance enthusiasts could grasp the idea behind the dance as well as to reflect the Sri Lankan traditions.
Reflecting on the competition Sandalindu Duggannarala, the captain of the dance team, said that he has always had a passion for dancing from grade one.
We have been taking part in competitions from grade five onwards. Our dance items have always topped the all island dance competitions. However this was our first experience abroad. We had to compete with students from foreign countries with diverse cultural backgrounds. That made it a very exciting experience to look forward to, he said.
Sandalindu is from Grade 11. He has been a member of the dance teams which had won first place in the all island dancing competitions held in the past. He was in both the Sword Dance as well as the Lee Keli dance items.
As the captain of the dance team I had to see that everything was in order. We had props like the swords and shields which went with the Sword Dance to take along with us and I had to make sure that they were not misplaced he said.
Isuri Chandrasiri says that the event taught her how to cooperate as a team and how to face challenges.
The temperature and climate in Russia is totally different from the atmosphere we have in Sri Lanka. Bearing those conditions and coping with the trials that you face in a foreign land made things difficult. However we managed to pull things off with winning colours as both our dance items clinched first place. Winning the Best of the Best award was the icing on the cake. We made a lot of new friends and shared a lot of memories, she added with a smile.
Isuri has been dancing since lower nursery. Though her mother has engaged in dancing during her childhood, Isuri was the one in the family who has developed a passion for the subject. She believes that her flair for dancing brought her fame and success.
Some of us had our examinations around the corner but we still wanted to take part in the event because it was a great opportunity which will benefit our future. The experience was worth the hardships, she said.
For Komudi Pinnedoowe Kandyan dancing signifies the glory of Sri Lankas rich culture. She says that there are so many diverse steps and gestures involved in the dance genre.
We did not know what was going on at the finale of the competition as everything was announced in Russian. When they called our name we were backstage. It was both a shocking and thrilling moment for us, she recalled.
She says that they practiced throughout December to get ready for the event. Hard work, determination and the spirit to keep going till they got the steps and gestures right was the teams success formula.
All the groups who took part in the competition performed well. This made us realize that we had to perform exceptionally well to make a significant impact. I was especially enthralled by a western dance which was performed to the track called Believer, says Nimduli Athukorala.
Though Nimduli was in the Sword Dance, she says that if she had to choose which was the best one between the two, she would definitely choose Lee Keli.
The team performed exceptionally well and I felt that we were capable of winning the event. We also interacted with some of the other dance troupes but language was a barrier as they were not very conversant in English. We learnt a lot by watching their performances, she added.
Apart from their winning moment the next highlight of the whole experience for the team was the moment when it started snowing in Moscow. It was a first time experience for many of the youth in the team.
Lashawn De Mel is from grade 11. He has been a member from both dance items.
The Sword Dance is full of energy while the Lee Keli brings the Sri Lankan culture to the fore. I enjoyed the Sword Dance because of the vigor behind the dance moves, he said.
Noyeli Jayasekara says that she would encourage youth to engage in Kandyan dancing because it teaches them about the roots of the nation.
You need to learn to balance your extracurricular activities and your studies. It is essential to become an all rounder, she stressed.
She says that she is grateful to the teachers for giving them the training which not only enhanced their skills but also led them to secure this win.
The Lyceum Group Coordinating Principal Kumari Grero had been supporting them all the way backed by the Founder Mohan Lal Grero, Director Nikitha Grero, and Deputy principals Dulka Mendis and Azfa Rafik. Apart from Rasika and Nisha Kothalawala, Tharaka Sandaruwani, Chalani Pabashwari and Malindu Madhuranga too trained the students.
Apart from taking part in the all island inter school dance competition the other item in the dance troupes calendar is their talent show Maathra which is staged every year.

President Maithripala Sirisena has asked that all decisions be made collectively at Cabinet and not outside, so that all could work together as a government, clarified Co-Cabinet spokesperson, Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne yesterday, as he quelled rumours of a rift between President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Cabinet this week.
The media this week had reported that the PM earned the Presidents ire when he had asked for more time to abolish the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) as requested by the President. The President for a second week in a row had submitted a Cabinet paper asking that the CCEM be abolished and all economic decisions be taken through his National Economic Council (NEC).
The President simply asked the PM to quickly take all steps necessary to come together as one team and work for the future, added Co-Cabinet spokesperson, Minister Gayantha Karunathilake, at the weekly Cabinet media briefing held at the Department of Government Information.
Any subjects which need special attention can have a Cabinet sub-committee appointed under the Prime Minister to look into that, explained Minister Senaratne further.

## Title: Confidence set in motion
## Supertitle:

Confidence set in motion
The motion of no-confidence against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe which will be taken up for debate in Parliament and voted on next Wednesday has become the focus of all political activity in the major political parties, who are lining up to take up their respective positions on the issue.
The motion is based mostly on allegations that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe should take responsibility for the Central Bank bond sales debacle which was the subject of an inquiry by a Presidential Commission. The Commission found that the Prime Minister had made an error of judgment in placing his confidence in former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran but did not find him responsible for any wrongdoing.
The main instigators of the motion have been the Joint Opposition (JO), the faction of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) loyal to former President Rajapaksa. The motion was signed by 55 members of Parliament and ironically, the only JO parliamentarian who did not sign the motion was Rajapaksa himself. Rajapaksa was however present when the motion was handed over to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
Four MPs loyal to President Sirisena - State Ministers T B Ekanayake, Deputy Ministers Nishantha Muthuhettigama and Susantha Punchinilame and parliamentarian Cader Masthan - have signed the motion. Among them, Punchinilame is a former UNPer.
It is known that the JO itself was divided on whether it should submit the motion for a vote right now. A section of the JO believed they should, to take advantage of the momentum generated by their political party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) winning the recently concluded local government elections which in fact was the catalyst for the motion.
Anti-government sentiment
However, another group within the JO was of the opinion that if it does submit the motion, it must be sure of victory. A defeat of the vote would negate the gains made by the SLPP at the polls, they argued. Even Rajapaksa agreed with this view but later changed his decision, it is understood. It remains to be seen whether this is because he is confident of the vote succeeding or whether it is because he believes that the vote would generate much anti-government sentiment anyway remains to be seen.
Now that the motion has been submitted, the numbers game has begun. Political parties are scrambling to get a simple majority - 113 MPs - to either see the motion through or defeat it.
On Tuesday, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the main opposition party in Parliament announced that they would be opposing the motion. At least on paper, with 16 MPs in the ranks of the TNA and the UNP having 106 MPs- along with one MP from the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) supporting it as well, the UNP appears to command the support of the majority in Parliament- and UNP stalwarts have been keen to point this out.
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), the other major party in Parliament, is yet to announce its stance on the motion. It has been vocal in its criticism of the government, the UNP and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe but if anything, it has been even more strident in its criticism of the previous regime and the conduct of the Rajapaksas during that time.
It had, at one time, stated that it would support the motion if it also included the Prime Ministers failure to act against those responsible for corruption in the previous government but this will obviously not eventuate as the motion is being sponsored by the JO.
Petroleum Industries Minister Arjuna Ranatunga claimed that the real target of the motion was not merely the Prime Minister but the entire government. It was part of a plot to oust Speaker Jayasuriya and then impeach President Maithripala Sirisena, he said. The motion was planned by those who have no future in politics. They expect to come to Parliament after the next general elections through the backdoor because none of them could win in an election, he told the media.
Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) leader Champika Ranawaka, while maintaining that the government needed urgent reforms, has also spoken out against the motion. He would not support the no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister because it was submitted by a group involved in serious financial crimes much worse than the Central Bank bond issue, Ranawaka has said.
The UNP, however, is taking no chances. It has requested all parliamentarians who are now overseas to return to the island well in time for next Wednesdays vote. UNP MPs Ranjan Ramanayake, Dr Kavinda Jayawardena, Dr Tusitha Wijemanne and Rohini Kumari Wijeratne are part of the delegation headed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya visiting China. They were scheduled to return on April 3 but have now been advised to return by April 1.
This is because of reports- propagated mostly by the JO but by some UNP dissidents as well- that some UNP MPs would vote in support of the motion. There are at least three MPs who are likely to vote for the motion: Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Palitha Range Bandara and Venerable Athuraliye Rathana Thera.
Bandara, in particular, has been extremely critical of the Prime Minister recently and while addressing a swearing-in ceremony of the newly appointed UNP councillors to local government bodies in the Anamaduwa electorate on Monday claimed that there were 27 UNP Parliamentarians who are ready to cast their votes in favour of the no-confidence motion or at least abstain from voting.
UNP leadership
It is clear from a look at the numbers in Parliament that the motion does indeed require the support of at least a dozen UNPers if it is to succeed. The rationale of the JO- and indeed some ministers such as S B Dissanayake - is that UNPers are sufficiently dissatisfied with the UNP leadership that they will vote for the no-confidence motion to oust the Prime Minister.
It is understood that Dissanayake has been entrusted with the task of delivering the UNP MPs to vote in support of the motion. Dissanayake has proclaimed this is possible but given his reputation, his announcements are viewed some degree of scepticism.
The Minister of Social Empowerment has had a chequered career in politics, being General Secretary of the SLFP, falling out with former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, joining the UNP and then serving time in jail for contempt of the Supreme Court.
Dissanayake supported Rajapaksa during the 2015 presidential election campaign but failed to secure a seat at the last general election. However, he was appointed to Parliament by President Maithripala Sirisena through the National List. He now appears to favour reconciliation with the Rajapaksa faction.
President Maithripala Sirisena has maintained a stoic silence over the motion of no-confidence. Senior UNPers have met him for discussion but he has remained non-committal. Nevertheless, it is the view of the majority of the UNP that the SLFPs support for the motion would require at least the tacit support of the President who has, quite noticeably, also not spoken out against the motion of no-confidence motion. It is also well known that he did request Prime Minister Wickremesinghe to step aside following the declaration of local government election results.
The stage is thus set for an enthralling week ahead as the country debates its third motion of no-confidence against a Prime Minister. Hopefully, by this time next week, the curtain would have finally fallen on this drama- and the nation can look forward to a government returning to the business of governing the country without any distractions.

Cricket Australia slaps 12-month bans on Smith and Warner
JOHANNESBURG, Wednesday: Sacked Australia captain Steve Smith and David Warner have both been banned for 12 months for their roles in the ball-tampering scandal in Cape Town, Cricket Australia (CA) announced on Wednesday, after uncovering a web of lies told by the players after they were caught.
Opening batsman Cameron Bancroft was banned for nine months following the scandal, which has outraged the fans, jolted the sponsors and prompted CA to send the players home from South Africa.
The trio will be allowed to compete in club cricket, but cannot take part in state or international games for the duration of their bans.
David Warner will not be considered for team leadership positions in the future, CA said in the statement, having fingered him in developing the plot.
Smith and Bancroft will have to wait two years before they are considered for leadership roles, and even then it will be conditional on acceptance by fans and the public, according to CA.
Each player must also complete 100 hours of community service before being considered for future selection, while it was confirmed that the cheat had been confined to the trio only, exonerating team mates and coach Darren Lehmann of any wrong-doing.
A key finding was that Bancroft had in fact used sandpaper to rough up the ball in the third test at Newlands, and not sticky tape as he stated, adding an extra element of premeditation to the actions and re-opening questions as to whether this was an isolated incident.
Warner was also found guilty of provision of advice to a junior player (Bancroft) regarding how a ball could be artificially altered including demonstrating how it could be done.
Part of the findings against both Smith and Bancroft were that they had mislead both the umpires on the field of play, and the public in a press conference as to the the nature, extent and participants of the plan.
While Smith and Bancroft were both found guilty of knowledge of the plan to cheat, a CA statement credits Warner with the development of the plot, suggesting he was the instigator.
All three also have the right to appeal their sentences.
The CA Board understands and shares the anger of fans and the broader Australian community about these events, Cricket Australia Chairman, David Peever said in a statement.
They go to the integrity and reputation of Australian Cricket and Australian sport and the penalties must reflect that.
These are significant penalties for professional players and the Board does not impose them lightly. It is hoped that following a period of suspension, the players will be able to return to playing the game they love and eventually rebuild their careers.
FINANCIAL FALLOUT
Smith and Warner have also been stood down from their Indian Premier League (IPL) teams for 2018, representing a significant loss of income after the Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers Hyderabad had paid $1.84-million respectively for their services.
First, we waited for ICCs (International Cricket Council) decision, after that Cricket Australias and then we decided on the matter, IPL chairman Rajeev Shukla told reporters.
We have decided to bar them from this season. The replacements will be made available to the two teams. We did not take any decision in haste, it was a well thought-out decision.
There is more financial fallout possible with multinational electronics company LG (066570.KS) having already said they will not renew a sponsorship with Warner, while several other partners of Cricket Australia are reviewing their positions in light of the embarrassing scandal.
The players will be available for the World Cup in England and Wales that starts on May 30 next year, as well as the Ashes series later in the English summer.
The trio will be replaced for the fourth and final test at The Wanderers in Johannesburg by opening batsmen Matthew Renshaw and Joe Burns, as well as all-rounder Glenn Maxwell.
South Africa lead what has been a tempestuous series 2-1 having not enjoyed a home test series success against the Australians since 1970.  Agencies

CTB, you are wanted!
A bus service exists from Mt. Lavinia to Piliyandala through Katubedda under route No. 255, which provides a great service to students of Moratuwa University situated in Katubedda. The commuters who attend schools in Ratmalana/Mt. Lavinia area such as Prince and Princess of Wales, Lalith Athulathmudali MV and Girls High School are greatly benefitted.
Way back in the 1990s there was an efficient bus service operating on Borupana Road  both CTB and Private  under route No 256 from Golumadama Junction on Galle Road up to Borupana Junction  nearly 2Km away from Galle Road. At that time there was no bridge over the Weresse River and only a ferry service operated to take the public to and from either side of the river. After a few years, a bridge was installed over the Weresse River  where the ferry service operated  and the government took steps to widen the road from the bridge onwards up to the point it opens to Colombo-Piliyandala Road. Already a CTB bus from Moratuwa Depot operates on this road in the morning and afternoon only to provide a service to people attending offices situated at Maharagama and Piliyandala areas.
Initially, 15-seater private vans used to ply on this road, at 15-minute intervals from either end of Borupana Road providing a great service to residents of Borupana at peak hours. Later on, when the authorities banned 15-seater vans from transporting passengers, the van operators turned to bigger buses that usually run on main roads, and the waiting time on either end of Borupana Road got increased from 15 minutes to more than 30 minutes  to get a full bus load of passengers for each trip. At this point, the three-wheelers cashed in on the situation and started providing transportation at concessionary rates to passengers, taking four passengers in each trip and charging only Rs 10 from each passenger. Later on, the three-wheel mafia took a firm grip on the situation and private buses suffered a slow death and there are no more private buses plying on Borupana Road.
Now the situation has changed drastically. Hundreds of students attend Kotelawala Defence University situated at Kandawala and many of the students who are residing in lodging places quite a distance away from the university in Katubedda and Mount Lavinia areas  after getting down on Galle Road at Golumadama Junction have no other option other than using the three-wheeler service to attend the university and to get back to Galle Road. Further the Medical Campus and the newly constructed Teaching Hospital of the Defence University are situated at Werehera on Colombo-Piliyandala Road  through which the bus on proposed route No 256 would ply  and as such a regular CTB bus service on this route would definitely make the lives of all the medical students and supporting staff a bit easier  when they have to commute to and from the Main University Campus and the Hospital at Werehera.
Additionally, the Driving License Issuing Office is also situated at Werehera and a CTB service would be of immense benefit to hundreds who call over at Werehera Driving License Issuing Office from Ratmalana-Mt. Lavinia area.
The Hindu College, as well as the Vocational Training Institute under the Ministry of Skills Development too, are also situated on Borupana Road for which a large number of students as well as teachers attend daily. Accordingly, it's high time for the State-owned CTB to come forward and break the three-wheeler mafia that operates on Borupana Road and provide an efficient bus service  which the people of Borupana lost almost two decades ago.

Customs duty on petrol, diesel reduced
The Customs duty on Petrol and Diesel has been reduced to Rs.12 and Rs.4 per liter respectively in order to maintain the same fuel prices.
Customs duty has been reduced to shield local fuel prices from the continuous price increase in crude oil recorded in the international market over the last three months.
Accordingly, the customs duty on a Petrol liter has been reduced from Rs. 35 to Rs. 12 where as the duty on a Diesel liter has been decreased from Rs. 15 to Rs. 4.
The government will endure the loss incurred from the duty reduction among all other welfare and development expenses.
When compared with the International Price Index, Sri Lanka provides fuel at a very low cost.
The government reduced the Petrol price per liter from Rs. 162 to Rs. 117 and Diesel price from Rs. 111 to Rs. 95. Even though the government continues with these same prices in 2018, the international fuel prices have continued to grow during the time span.

Fitch assigns NTBs Basel III Sub-Debt Issue Final A-(lka)
Ratings has assigned Nations Trust Bank PLCs (NTB, A(lka)/Stable) Sri Lanka rupee-denominated proposed Basel III-compliant subordinated unsecured debentures a final National Long-Term Rating of A-(lka).
The final rating is the same as the expected rating assigned on 16 October 2017 and follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received.
The debentures, totaling LKR3.5 billion, will mature in five years and carry fixed coupons. The debentures qualify as regulatory Tier II capital for the bank and include a non-viability clause. The bank plans to use the proceeds to support its loan book expansion and to strengthen its Tier II capital base. The debentures are to be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange.
Fitch rates the proposed Tier II instrument one notch below the banks National Long-Term Rating of A (lka) to reflect the notes subordinated status and higher loss-severity risks relative to senior unsecured instruments. The notes would convert to equity upon the occurrence of a trigger event as determined by the Monetary Board of Sri Lanka.
NTBs National Long-Term Rating is used as the anchor rating because the rating reflects the banks standalone financial strength. Fitch believes that the banks standalone credit profile best indicates the risk of becoming non-viable.

Global demand for SL rubber on the rise, exports up by 18%
Sri Lankas rubber sector received a major opening from worlds leader in car production when Slovakia, worlds leader in car production called for using Sri Lankan rubber specially rubber tyres for their car manufacturing industry.
We want to diversify our rubber intake and to this end want to expand the sourcing from our present African and South East Asian suppliers, stressed the visiting Slovak Finance Minister Peter Kazimir. Slovak Minister Kazimir, who accompanied a nine-member official delegation, was in discussion with Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen during his courtesy call on Minister Bathiudeen in Colombo yesterday.
As a result of post-Soviet era economic restructuring, Slovakia has become a manufacturing economy. 40% of our industrial exports are automotives. Well established global brands such as KIA, Volkswagen, Jaguar Land Rover, Audi, and PSA Peugeot Citroen are now manufacturing in Slovakia at Tier One OEM level, said Slovak Minister Kazimir.
More than 400 Slovak SMEs too are part of our supply chain as second tier suppliers and Tyre supplies are crucial for us.
We want to expand this sourcing and are now keenly focusing on Sri Lankan rubber sector, especially tyres. We also wish to send our business delegations here and even ready to transfer our technical know how to Sri Lankan (automotive) industry.
Slovak Minister Kazimir also stressed their interest in investing in Sri Lanka and called for a bilateral Investment Protection and Double Tax Avoidance mechanisms between both countries during his meeting with Minister Bathiudeen.
Bilateral trade between Sri Lanka and Slovakia totalled a mere $ 45 Million in 2017. Sri Lankas leading export to Slovakia in 2017 was apparel.
Global demand for our high quality rubber continues to increase-even last year our rubber exports increased by 18% to $ 39 million from 2016s $33 million, Minister Bathiudeen responded.

Go green !
Eco-friendly construction begins with intelligent design. By thinkingstrategically and adopting the right materials and technology early,you can help save the environment while saving you money.
Be Smart When It Comes To Design
Smaller buildings are generally more environmentally friendly and cheaper to run. Intelligent design means making the best use of space possible. It forces developers to start thinking creatively about space, and the future of infrastructure.
Consider The PlacementOf Windows
Something as simple as the placement of windows can make a great deal of difference to the atmosphere of a room. Innovative technology for builders assist in identifying the most strategic window positions to take advantage of sunlight and natural breezes.
Invest In Proper Insulation
Insulation is another thing to consider when building an eco-friendly property. Investing in proper insulation keeps the area cool in the hotter months, and warm during the winter, minimising the need to run heating and cooling units regularly.
Research Ways To Keep Your Roof Cool
In particularly tropical areas like Australia, a building's exposure to the sun can result in heat being trapped inside the roof, gradually warming up the interior of the building. Green roofsare an innovative solution to this problem.
Heat-reducing methods such as using reflective roof paint, roof covering, tiles, or planting grass will result in a cooler building, and save the energy and money it would otherwise take to cool it.
Assess Durability andLifespan Of Foundations
Life expectancy in architecture and construction is growing in importance. Durable materials such as brick, stone, and concrete have a longer lifetime and are more eco-friendly during the demolition and disposal phase. Extensions, renovations, and refurbishments stretch the life of a building, especially when structures are built using durable materials.
Use Sustainable, Biodegradable,and Recyclable Materials Where Possible
Reusing old materials where possible is an easy way to save money and reduce environmental impacts of your construction. Products like recycled lumber, plastic, and glass are less damaging than buying new. Biodegradable materials are also being produced with reduced energy costs and pollution.
Install Water Saving Fixtures
Reducing water wastage is easily achieved by installing water fixtures to reduce the flow of toilets, showerheads and taps. Encourage clients to purchase eco friendly products by calculating their future water savings.
Think About Geothermal Heating
A geothermal system harnesses temperatures below ground to warm residential homes or businesses. Pipes under the ground are led to a heat pump to either warm or cool the building. The relatively new technology only needs a small amount of electricity to run, saving owners money and energy.
Determine WhetherProperty Can Be Run On Solar
Solar power converts the suns radiation into energy. Installing solar panels may be expensive, but in the long run saves a lot of money and energy consumption. However, to take advantage of solar power, location must be considered, as well as the positioning of solar panels. Estimating software assists in determining how much power can be collected and saved.

Indian RTI expert praises Sri Lankas law
The beauty of Sri Lankas Right to Information Act is that it is free, Indian Express Senior Editor Shyamlal Yadav said at a press briefing on Wednesday.
Yadav, a veteran journalist at the Mumbai-based newspaper, said he had filed over 7,000 RTI requests in India since the law went into effect in 2005.
Sri Lankas RTI law was came into effect in February of last year. He encouraged the Sri Lankan journalists and citizens to initiate the use of it as much as possible.
Yadav said that in India, the effect of the law was widespread. It has opened up the mindset of the government machinery, he said.
At present, according to him, government officials are more wary of what they do in their official capacity.
Corruption could not be completely wiped away from the government anywhere, he said, adding, that they were afraid now.
India's law, unlike their counterpart Sri Lanka's, requires the people to pay a fee of Rs.10 as an application fee to request for information from a government body.
Nevertheless, Yadav said that it had emboldened ordinary citizens throughout the country.
According to him, people could leverage the law against obstinate government officials. They could say, I will destroy your career with ten rupees, he quipped.
Interestingly, the bulk of Sri Lankas RTI requests also come from rural areas such as Matara, Hambantota and Polonnaruwa, according to Sri Lanka's RTI Commission.
Yadav said that journalists have a duty to use the RTI to expose corruption. He has used RTI requests to expose wide-scale government malpractice in India, such as showing how banks used 1 - rupee deposits to help make Prime Minister Narendra Modis Jan Dhan bank account scheme look more effective than it actually was.
But he warned that most requests he files are ignored or rejected.
As you are learning to collect information, the officer on the other side, they are learning to deny the information, he said. According to him, an informed, active citizenry was the only way to make sure the law works.

Delivering a statement on behalf of the President of the General Assembly, Ambassador Perera reflected on the legacy of slavery and underlined its lasting impact on present day social and economic inequalities. Discrimination, racism and xenophobia continue to plague our world. People are still stripped of their humanity - exploited and abused for economic gain. Divisive and dehumanising rhetoric is on the rise. Minorities and the vulnerable are targeted as the cause of problems. We must look at these warning signs and take corrective and preventive action, he stated.
These sentiments were echoed by UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, who reiterated the importance of education and outreach, commending programmes such as the UN's Remember Slavery Programme and UNESCO's Slave Route Project. He acknowledged that the Transatlantic Slave Trade was the largest forced legal movement of people in history and asserted that the way to honour the lives of its victims would be to ensure that all people live in dignity.
The keynote address of the event was delivered by former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Panama, Graciela Dickson. As a young woman of African descent and the great granddaughter of a former slave growing up in Panama, Dickson emphasized that the descendants of slaves are the living testimony of the triumphs of their ancestors and the resilience of black African women.
Statements were also delivered by the Permanent Representatives of Qatar on behalf of Asia Pacific States, Gambia on behalf of African States, Belarus on behalf of the Eastern European States, Uruguay on behalf of Latin American and Caribbean States, Israel on behalf of Western European states, as well as the Permanent Representatives of the United States, Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, Cuba and Brazil. Representatives additionally commended the efforts by the UN in commemorating the victims of the transatlantic slave trade, including through the permanent memorial The Ark of Return set up by Haitian American architect Rodney Leon at the visitors plaza of the UN Headquarters in New York.The meeting was followed by a cultural and culinary experience at the United Nations Visitors Lobby, featuring fare from a number of member states, including a Sri Lanka Tea station.

Arjun Aloysius FR petition:
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena declines to take Bench
Supreme Court Justice Prasanna Jayawardena yesterday declined to sit on the Bench regarding a Fundamental Rights petition filed by Arjun Aloysius, the Chairman of W.M. Mendis & Company Limited, challenging the Central Banks decision to impose restrictions on his companys bank accounts.
When the petition came up before Supreme Court three-judge-Bench headed by Justice Sisira de Abrew, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena declined to sit on the bench since he served as a member of Presidential Commission to inquire into Central Bank bond issue.
This petition was fixed for support on April 3.
W.M. Mendis & Company Limited and its Chairman Arjun Joseph Aloysius had filed this petition seeking an interim order directing the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to release forthwith the funds required by the company to meet its day to day operational expenses and obligations.
The petitioners cited the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, Central Bank Deputy Governor C.J.P. Siriwardana and three others as respondents.
The petitioners state that they were shocked and surprised when on January 26, 2018, W.M. Mendis & Company was informed by its parent company, Perpetual Capital Holdings that the 1st Respondent has on or about 26.01.2018, purported to restrict the accounts of W.M. Mendis & Company maintained in licensed banks. The petitioners state however that to date the 1st to 4th Respondents have failed and refused to release the funds required to meet the expenditure and obligations and keep afloat the Companies including the 1st Petitioner who are subject to the said restriction, despite it having been undertaken by them at the meeting held on 30.01.2018, that expeditious release of such funds would be made.
The Petitioners reiterate that the 2nd Respondent also mentioned at the said meeting held on 30.01.2018, that the said restrictions have been imposed under and in terms of the provisions of section 15 of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act No. 6 of 2006 and that the same would be extended by an Order of the High Court.
The Petitioners state however that the 1st to 4th respondents failed and refused to release the requisite funds to keep inter alia the Petitioner Company afloat, despite agreeing to do so at the meeting held on 30.01.2018 and the CEO of the 1st Petitioner by letter dated 14.02.2018 addressed to the CG Governor, stated inter alia as follows: 18 days have lapsed since all the Companys bank accounts were restricted and frozen. The company has not been served with any correspondence or Court Orders setting out the basis for the restriction. There is no direction as to how the Company can carry out its day to day operations. The company is getting harassed by banks, suppliers and employees on a daily basis with respect to payments.
Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana with Navin Marapana under the instruction of counsel Sanath Wijewardena appeared for the petitioner. Senior Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda appeared for the Attorney General.

Language is s ' war zone'

Ngugi wa Thiongo would not be happy to see me writing about him in English. He would have preferred if I wrote this article in Sinhala first, and then, translated it into English. Even though his first novels were written in English, ever since he was imprisoned by the Kenyan government for writing the play Ngaahika Ndeenda (I Will Marry When I Want) he started to write in Gikuyu, his mother tongue.
The first novel he wrote in Gikuyu was written during his year-long imprisonment in 1978, when, after being arrested in the middle of the night, he was held without trial, in a maximum-security prison in Kenya. The reason for his arrest was his role in the writing and staging of Ngaahika Ndeenda, produced by and starring local peasants, reflecting the inequalities and injustices in Kenyan society. He continued to resist the activities of the government even while he was jailed. He wrote a novel Caitani Mutharabaini, translated into English as Devil on the Cross from his cell on the only thing availablesquares of toilet paper. As he was never charged, tried or sentenced, he had no way of knowing how long he would be held captive. The novel was a form of spiritual survival, he says. It was fun writing when I did not have paper. All I had was toilet paper. But occasionally I got a pen from the prison authorities if I said I was writing some kind of confessionI dont know what there was to confess.
It was his decision to stop writing in English while he was imprisoned that many people still question. And the answer he gives is simple; If I meet an English person, and he says, I write in English, I dont ask him Why are you writing in English If I meet a French writer, I dont ask him, Why dont you write in Vietnamese But I am asked over and over again, Why do you write in Gikuyu For Africans, the view is there is something wrong about writing in an African language.
He thinks the so-called developing countries should invest in ones own culture and resources and say no to the language of the colonizers. He believes the colonizers weaponized native languages and used it against the natives. If you know all the languages of the world and you dont know your mother tongue or the language of your culture, that is enslavement. But if you know your mother tongue or the language of your culture and add to it all the languages of the world, that is empowerment. Monolingualism is the carbon monoxide of civilization. Of course, there are communities whose right to their language  as in the case of enslaved Africans  was taken away by force of law and violence. But they did create new languages. Those languages are languages in their own right, and they, like African languages, are not a lower rung on the ladder to an English heaven. I think African people, Latin American people, Asian people, must find a way of relating to each other a bit more and being able to say one thing: let us make things with our resources. And then exchange with others on the basis of equal give and equal take.
A novelist, playwright and essayist who sits alongside the likes of Nigerias Chinua Achebe and Wole Soyinka in the modern African pantheon, Ngugi wa Thiongo has been a perennial favourite for the Nobel Prize in Literature. A Nobel, he says in one interview, would be validating but not essential. Several years ago, he shot to the top of betting on the day the result was to be announced, only for one of his daughters to call and tell him that Perus Mario Vargas Llosa had won. He recalls the faces of the photographers who had gathered outside his home in anticipation of his victory: I was the one who was consoling them!
Ngugi was born in 1938 in Kamirithu, a village north of Nairobi, one of 28 children of a mercurial father with four wives. In the 1950s, his older brother, Good Wallace, joined the Mau Mau uprising against a ruthless British occupation whose prison camps were described by the then-solicitor general as having been distressingly reminiscent of conditions in Nazi Germany or Communist Russia. The British response to the rebellion was brutal and relentless. It even extended to weaponising language itself, says Ngugi. The British gave it the name of Mau Mau because its meaningless  as if to say it was a meaningless movement. If they had said, Land and Freedom Army, as [the fighters] called themselves, then they would be articulating the aims of the movement, he explains. Ngugis half-brother Gitogo was shot in the back and killed for refusing to obey a British soldiers command. Gitogo had not heard the command because he was deaf. His mother, who is the driving force behind his work, was detained in solitary confinement for three months.
And yet, Ngugi survived. He points to his mothers influence as the reason he never succumbed to the obstacles in his path. She could not read or write, but she sent me to school. She constantly pushed him. Even when I got 100 percent in anything, shed still ask me whether that was the best I could do, he says. In every situation she comes to my mind, whether I am trying my best in whatever circumstances I might be in, whether in jail or in exile, or under attack.
The results of his determination to do his best blossomed when in 1962, he was invited to a landmark symposium of African writers working in English, including Achebe, Soyinka, and the South African Lewis Nkosi. Everything seemed possible, he recalls. We could sense a new world was coming to be. Yet, this elation was short-lived. When he read a critique by Nigerian poet Obi Wali, who lamented the fact that, for an African writers conference, there wasnt a single text, not a single writer who wrote in an African language Ngugi realized things should change. He used this insight to overturn the Kenyan academia proposing African literature be taught in universities  and act which would eventually lead to his exile.
In 1982, Ngugi was in London when he was warned that if he returned to Kenya he would receive a red carpet welcome, of the bloodthirsty kind. He lived in exile for the next 22 years, while his children and their late mother in Kenya endured periodic abuses from the authorities. In 2004, two years after Moi was defeated in democratic elections, Ngugi returned. It was to be a triumphant homecoming for the countrys most celebrated writer, as he launched Wizard of the Crow, an 800-page allegorical magical realist satire that he had written in Gikuyu. He has said that the most beautiful line in the English version that followed is, A translation from Gikuyu by the author.
Asked when he was growing up if he ever thought he would become an internationally renowned author and that his stories of Kenya would be translated into 60 different languages, Ngugi who now lives in the United States said, No, never, not even that I would ever become a writer. The struggle to ensure that one seized whatever educational opportunities came ones way was hard enough. The competition for places in the few schools and colleges available was fierce. From elementary schools to colleges, every two years were terminal exams.
There were hardly any second chances. Once you got off the train, for whatever reason, you hardly ever got on it again. But I always wanted to read. My ambition, on entering a library for the first time in my life, was to one day be able to read all the books in the world. Reality would soon clip the wings of that ambition, but the desire to read remains.

Lets get this straight 
One of the solutions to a perfect, problem-free hair would be to go in for straightening. This gives you the added advantage of letting your hair fall straight, effortlessly, hardly ever knotting up. Be it thick, curly or frizzy hair, going for the poker straight look has been the answer to many hair woes for decades. Not only do you get to flaunt straight and manageable locks but it also promises silky, shiny, and sleek hair.
Meaning of rebonding hair
Rebonding is a chemical hair treatment that makes your hair straight, sleek and shiny. It is a permanent procedure
Each type of hair has a natural bond. Curly or wavy, are the results of natural bonds that give the hair its physical quality. The cream softener or relaxant used in the rebonding treatment breaks the hair structure. Then a neutraliser bonds the structure again and makes hair straight.
Why you should rebond your hair
If you have curly, frizzy, or unmanageable hair, you may have opted to have your hair straightened permanently. Straightening hair is increasingly common among women today.
Hair rebonding process
First the hair is washed with a mild shampoo. Conditioner is not applied. It is then left to dry naturally or is blow dried.
Then the stylist divides the hair into sections depending on the texture and volume. A relaxant from the hair bonding kit is applied while the hair is held straight with the help of thin plastic boards. The stylist takes care to apply the relaxant so that it coats every strand.
The relaxant is then left on for 30 to 45 minutes depending on the texture of the hair. Next the stylist proceeds to wash and dry the hair.
The hair is straightened with a flat iron. A ceramic flat iron is used to do this. A neutralizer is applied to secure the bonds and left on for 30 minutes. It is then rinsed out with cold water. Lastly the hair is blowdried.
Time
Hair rebonding is an elaborate process that incorporates the use of chemicals and heat to alter the structure of your hair. Depending on the length of your hair, the treatment can take from three to eight hours.
Colouring and rebondingat the same time
Wait for at least two weeks to colour your hair after a hair straightening treatment. You should wait at least two weeks to give your hair a chance to stabilize in its new straighter shape before colouring.
Difference between hair
straightening and hair rebonding
Hair straightening can be classified in different categories such as chemical hair straightening, thermal hair straightening, hair straightening through hot irons, using hair serums, etc. Whatever the process selected, the hair stylist uses the method only on a small section of hair at a time and then repeats it on the whole length of hair.
Rebonding is one of the special techniques of hair straightening that has the potential to transform the looks of a person if she has curly hair and desires to have straight hair like many Caucasians. As the name implies, the chemical bonds in hair follicles are broken and rearranged to make hair straight. In rebonding, hair straightening is achieved using strong chemicals. These chemicals go inside the inner layers of hairs and alter the structure to make them straight on a permanent basis until the new hair re-grows.
Side effects of hair rebonding
After rebonding, your hair requires utmost care and maintenance since it becomes fragile after the treatment.
Regular touch ups need to be done to maintain the texture and quality of the hair after the procedure. Since it is a permanent procedure, the effects are long lasting and there is no turning back to your natural hair once it is done.
Washing hair after rebonding
Do not wet your hair for three days after the procedure. You can then wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner. Leave the conditioner on your hair for a few extra minutes. Also, ensure you condition your hair every time you shampoo it.
Lasting period
If done correctly the rebonding can last for about six to seven months. However, once your hair is straightened you have to touch up the new growth every three months, six months or a year, depending on your growth.

Minister Harison says he is against relaxing ban on Glyphosate
The Minister of Rural Economic Affairs P. Harison, said that he was completely against relaxing the ban on Glyphosate. Relaxing the ban would be an act of digging our own graves, he said.
The Minister made this statement at the Rural Economic Development programme in Colombo, recently.
Coconut harvest has decreased during the last two years as we did not receive enough rain, causing a drought situation, he pointed out. Areas such as Kebithigollewa, Padaviya and Horowpathana are still suffering from the drought, he further said.
Nearly 7,000 coconut trees had been destroyed in 32 farms that belonged to the National Livestock Development Board. Partitioning of lands in areas such as Gampaha, had also affected coconut harvest, he pointed out.
From the Yala season, we are ready to give every farmer Rs. 500 for fertilizer. I personally opposed Glyphosate. I dont like to see little children stuck with kidney diseases. In the Padaviya area, most of the people were suffering from kidney diseases, the Minister added. He further said that ,We were distributing Agro equipment, Mechanical equipment and self employment equipment under this Rural Economic Programme.
If any of the equipment that we had provided has been sold, the Divisional Secretary should punish such person who had sold the property under the Property Act.
Under this programme, 7.15 million rupees worth equipment were distributed for 743 beneficiaries in Ipalogama.
The Secretary of the Ipalogama Local Council M.S.S. Sageethdraban, Director of the Rural Economic Affairs Ministry Pushpa Ranjani Abewardana and others participated at this programme.

NBT Act has removed NBT exemption on liquor
The Draft Amendment to the National Building Tax Act No 9 of 2009 (NBT Act) has removed the NBT exemption on liquor and provided exemptions to sporting goods, coconuts and agriculture machinery.
The Draft Amendment Bill prepared according to the 2018 Budget proposals, was approved by Cabinet on Tuesday.
Whilst there was controversy over changing the tax structure for hard and soft liquor in the 2018 Budget, this NBT exemption was unanimously approved - increasing prices of liquor across the board. NBT exemptions would soon be applicable to: non-motorized equipment and accessories for water sports such as Kayaks, Canoes, Kite Surfing and Diving, gem stones for cutting and re-exporting purposes, non-powered equipment and accessories for aero sports such as Hang Gliding, Ballooning, Dirigibles, Parachutes and Para-gliders, equipment that enables advanced technology agriculture practices, including greenhouses, poly tunnels and materials for the construction of greenhouses, coconut oil and other coconut related products and the service provided by the Sri Lanka Deposit Scheme.
These NBT exemptions are expected to benefit mainly the agriculture and adventure tourism industry in the country.

NCM, an utter failure - Kiriella
The No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will be defeated on April 4, Minister Lakshamn Kiriella said.
The most obvious flaw of this whole act is former President Mahinda Rajapakasa opting not to sign the No-Confidence Motion which he himself submitted together with other Joint Opposition supporters, Minister Kiriella pointed out.
Public Enterprise and Kandy Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella made these observations at the oaths taking ceremony of Kandy Local Government Council members of the United National Party.
As the Leader of the House, I proposed to sign a letter of confidence in support of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. 85 MPs signed the proposed letter only 15 minutes.Fifteen MPs who were abroad, expressed their confidence via email and Whatsapp. So it is very evident that this a No Confidence Motion will be an utter failure. We will definitely defeat this No Confidence Notion on April 4, Minister Kiriella said.
Addressing the newly elected councilors, Minister Kiriella said that Local Governemnt councillors should make this opportunity to lay a strong foundation to their future political careers. Referring to LG Councils to be the cradle of politics, Minister Kiriella pointed out that great political figures such as former Presidents J.R. Jayewardene and R. Premadasa began and built their political careers at grass rotts level.
Some LG councillors try to solve national issues. But your responsibility is to solve issues at rural level. They should learn how to treat people with dignity and respect. It is important that all of you understand your responsibilities as representatives of the village, Minister Kiriella said.

## Title: A new beginning

A new beginning
Most of the 8,000 councillors elected to local bodies around the island on February 10, 2018 have now taken oaths. Once the local bodies are properly constituted, it will be time for them to work. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, addressing some of the UNP councillors has advised them to work for the betterment of their villages and residents and not think of becoming rich through politics. This is a timely advice for all the newly elected members from all parties, not just the UNP.
Local politics is rife with people who have literally ridden into town on ramshackle bicycles and now ride in super luxury tax free cars and live in palatial mansions. How they acquired these riches is a mystery because their pay is certainly not sufficient to purchase such luxuries. Some of the new councillors too must certainly be having such dreams. But politics should not be thought of as a lottery win.
It is all too easy to get trapped in the web of corruption at local body level, where a lot of infrastructure contracts are given. The usual kickbacks for tenders system is mostly prevalent at local body level. The Government must close all loopholes that enable councillors to exploit the tender procedures to find a quick way to riches.
Another unfortunate consequence of the LG election is that many parties fielded candidates with less than stellar track records to make up the numbers. They will try to do their shady businesses from the local bodies but this should be prevented. The voters should observe how their representatives behave and reject any undesirable elements.
As mentioned in the beginning, there will now be more than 8,000 local councillors, double the precious number. They will paid by the taxpayers around the country who now have to raise twice the previous amount for pay and facilities. Thus the Provincial Councils and the Central Government must ensure that all 8,000 of them work tirelessly for benefit of the public. Otherwise the extra outlay will be a total waste. The local bodies must not be mere talk shops bur rather work-oriented institutions where decisions are implemented swiftly. It is quite acceptable to go on foreign study tours once or twice, but the councillors must use the knowledge gained during such tours to improve their areas. They should not be fun and shopping tours undertaken at public expense.
For the first time, more than 2,000 women have been elected to local bodies. This is a significant development. From an 18-year-old schoolgirl elected to the Nattandiya Pradeshiya Sabha to veteran politician Rosy Senanayake, the first-ever woman Mayor of Colombo, the woman councillors represent our best hope and best chance for reinvigorating the local bodies. It is a matter of shame that it took so long to address the gender imbalance in politics, but a start has nevertheless been made.
Women have a very good grasp of grassroots issues in their villages and towns and are also much less likely to be corrupt or violent. They also have a better understanding of domestic-level issues and will be able to tackle issues such as domestic violence, sexual abuse at village level. The male colleagues must extend their fullest support to the female counterparts and all should work together to uplift their areas.
There are many pressing issues such as garbage management and energy use that are common to both the city and the village. Garbage has become a major issue everywhere thanks to changing lifestyles. Innovative solutions will have to be found, such as the proposed garage-powered power stations. There should also be more emphasis on renewable energy. For example, local bodies can insist on backup solar power and net metering systems for large residential and commercial constructions.
If you catch a news bulletin on any TV channel, it will highlight a village which does not even have a proper access road or bridge. They have to transport patients through perilous jungle treks. The local bodies must identify such shortcomings and build the necessary roads and bridges without delay.
The opposite is often true in the cities, where the streets are chocked with traffic. Congestion has become a vexed issue in Colombo, Kandy and other major cities with no immediate solution in sight. Since most of the roads cannot be widened anymore and overpasses are highly expensive, improving public transport is the best solution. Colombo will get a Light Rail Transit (LRT) system over the next few years. Since this cannot be replicated everywhere, the next best solution is improving the bus services. The Government plans to import electric buses to strengthen the bus fleet, but the key is to get motorists to keep their cars at home and ride the bus at least to their workplaces on weekdays.
Let us not forget that todays young local councillors are the MPs, Ministers and leaders of tomorrow. Serving the public with integrity and dedication will take them higher up the political ladder and possibly create a new generation of politicians devoid of corruption.

No provisions in Constitution to bring NCM aimed at only removing PM - Vajira
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena yesterday said that there is no provisions in the Constitution to bring a No-Confidence Motion at only removing the Prime Minister.
He said Article 48(2) of the Constitution provides for a No-Confidence Motion against the Government and not the Prime Minister, if Parliament rejects a Statement of Government Policy or the Appropriation Bill that the Cabinet of Ministers shall stand dissolved, he added.
Minister Abeywardena said the Prime Minster Ranil Wickremesinghe had said that he will face this as it has been forwarded under the traditions of British system despite no provisions in the Constitution for it.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, the Minister said the Presidential Commission Investigating the Treasury Bond issue has already dealt with all the allegations in the charge sheet containing in the No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister.
Therefore, this was the action of a certain deranged group to bring such a suggestion despite the Prime Minister being cleared of any misconduct or wrong doing by the Presidential Commission investigating the Treasury Bond issue, Minister Abeywardena said.
Eventhough this is baseless, we as a government will bravely face it and defeat it in order to consolidate public confidence on the government, he said.
According to the Constitution, this motion can not be taken for the debate. There is no moral validity on it as it has been brought against the peoples mandate given to Prime Minister. The PM can be removed only through a referendum, Minister Abeywardena added.
The Presidential Commission investigating the Treasury Bond issue has clearly stated that no politician has been involved in the bond issue. The Commission report has clearly mentioned the culprits and legal action has already been taken against them. If any issue is before Courts,it cannot be debated in Parliament.So, it is evident the motion has been brought to sling mud at the PM, he said.
The Minister further said although other Central Banks in the world follow rules and regulations regarding Bond auction procedure, our Central Bank did not follow such rules for the last 35 years. It was Prime Minster Wickremesinghe who introduced such rules and regulations on regarding Bond auction and obtained Cabinet approval at the end of year 2016.
Due to the lack of rules and regulations, several companies have made disproportionate profits through the Bond auction. Before, we came in to power, around eight private banks were involved in this process under private placement. Due to irregularities in the system, we opened the process to the world. However, no action can be taken regarding the Bond issue taken place during the period of 2008 to 2015 as there are no adequate laws enacted in the Bond auction process, Minister Abeywardena said.
The Minister further said the recent Local Government election was a national crime. The government has to bear an unnecessary burden due to the large number of members appointed to the Local Bodies.
Eventhough if any political party has won the majority in a particular Local Government body, ultimately it has to loose the power of it when Mayors and Chairman are appointed. This is totally an abnormal system which should be changed soon, he added.

No secret vote for NCM
Standing Orders are clear that there cannot be a secret vote for a No-Confidence Motion (NCM), Deputy Secretary General and Chief of Staff of Parliament Neil Iddawala said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday he said secret votes can be requested only on two occasions as per the Standing Orders, that is when selecting the Speaker and when appointing a President if the position suddenly fell vacant.
Parliament Assistant Director (Administration) Janakantha De Silva pointed out that there had been no instance in Parliament history where a secret vote was taken on a no-confidence motion, and no such provision is provided in the Standing Orders.
He pointed out the last secret vote was taken in April 2004 to elect the Speaker when the names of both W.J.M. Lokubandara and D.E.W. Gunasekara were proposed for the post.
The sittings went on around 11 pm and three rounds of vote had to be conducted as it was a tie at the previous two occasions, he recollected.
He pointed out the vote on No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister scheduled for April 4 would be taken by name or by row.
The Party Leaders who met yesterday decided not to use the newly installed electronic voting system during the NCM against the PM due to its technical faults experienced in Parliament last Friday.
A special Party Leaders Meeting chaired by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was held at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday to discuss about the NCM.
It was decided at the meeting to revert to the old system of voting till the technical errors of the e-vote system are sorted out. According to the agreement at the Party Leaders Meeting, the United National Front will receive 40 percent of the total time allocated for the debate on the NCM, while the UPFA, TNA and JVP will receive 60 percent of the total time.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella had pointed out that the person holding the position of Deputy Speaker must act independently as per the Westminster parliamentary tradition, but going against this tradition Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala had made media statements on the NCM. Kiriella had raised concerns over the recent media statements by the Deputy Speaker.
Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera, who took part in the meeting, had stated that the JOs NCM as printed in the Order Book is not only against Prime Minister Ranil Wicrekremesinghe but also against the Government.
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala, Minister Mano Ganesan, MPs Ravi Karunanayake, Dinesh Gunawardena and Anura Kumara Dissanayake also took part in the meeting.

One-day games produced good cricket
The three one-day school games played between traditional rivals last weekend all produced good cricket.
Sylvestrians pocket the Mediwake trophy
Much was expected from Vidyartha College like in the big match but they failed at Asgiriya. Batting first they were bundled out for 130 runs in 42.2 overs. Chathuranga Dilsha did well to score 30 runs and Dunidu Imasha 20, Pasan Hettiarachchi bowled to a good line and length to take 3 for 25and there was two wickets each from Nimsara Attanagalla and Nadeera Balasuriya.
Sylvestrians, too started badly but managed to reach their target scoring 131 for 5 in 25 overs to win the match and the Nilagoda/Mediwake trophy.
Nirmalan Pavithran who scored a century in the big match scored an unbeaten 50 in 49 balls Nimsara Attangalla too did well with an unbeaten 35, Sanjaya Seneviratne took 2 for 18.
Trinity win Richard Aluwihare trophy
Hasithas Boyagodas spectacular hundred and superb all-round performance helped Trinity to a five-wicket victory over St Anthonys at Katugastota. The Antonians suffered one of their worst one day slumps since this one day was introduced being dismissed for 156 to hand to Trinity a 149-run win. Most of the cricket loving Antonians indicated that players needed to take responsibility for their poor performance. The cricket presented by the Antonians was not in the correct format. They did not play well, they failed to put it all together on the one day and there has been something lacking. In the two day games they did extremely well to win six games.
In this 38th one dayer much was expected from the Antonians at their home venue but they were rattled by Boyagodas brilliance. Trinity raced to 305-7 in 50 overs with Boyagoda contributing 109 off 111 balls with 12 fours and four sixes. Thisaru Dilshan too did well with the bat to score an unbeaten 47, Hasintha Jayasooriya scored 41, Ashok Kumara 46 and Pubudu Bandara 29. Off-spinner Kalhara Senaratne was the only bowler to do well to take 4 for 47.
St. Anthony's in their turn failed to do well, at their own den and were bowled out for 156 in 41 overs. Navodya Vijekuma made 37 and Kalhara Senaratne 31. Ruvin Peris, Hasith Boyagoda and Kavinshka Senadheera took two wickets apiece. It was Trinitys 18th win of the series out of 38 games.
At the end Trinitys match winning captain was presented with the man of the match and best batsmans award, Antonian Kalhara Seneviratne won the best bowlers award and Thisaru Dilshan the best fielder.
Rajans win Winston Hoole trophy by 5 runs
Dharmaraja College who won the toss and batted first in the annual one-day game against Kingwood College piled up 214-7 in 50 overs with Dulaj Bandara contributing 67 and Mathjila Gayeshan 31. Placeman Utpala Jayalath took 3 for 40 and off-spinner Saumaya Piyasena 2 for 48.
Kingswood College were never really in touch and were dismissed for 209 runs in 48.1 overs. Ganidu Kaushalya made 33, Hashika Gamage 29 and Deegaye Bandara was not out on 25. Navindu Dilshan, Yasitha Samararatne and Upendera Warnakulasuriya took two wickets each.
60th Battle of the Babes a draw again
The Vidyartha-St. Sylvesters 60th Battle of the Babes played at Pallekelle Stadium ended in a draw with Sylvestrians taking the major honors. Sylvestrians who won the toss and invited Vidyartha to bat dismissed them for 229 runs in 74 overs. Pulina Gunathilake scored a century. Kasun Karunathilake and Gihan Jayasekara were able to score 28 runs each. In bowling Nadeera Balasuriya and Husindu Nissanka took 3 wickets each.
Sylvestrians in their turn went on to score 300 for 6 in 84.5 overs. Manoharan Pavithran scored a superb century and Pasan Hettiarachchi 88. Nimsara Atharagalla was the most successful bowler to take 3 wickets for 53 runs.
In their second innings Vidyartha were struggling at 111 for 7 wickets in 29 overs. Pulina Gunatilake batted well to score 42, Ravishka Upananda made 36. Nimsara Atharagalla took three wicket and Nadeera Balasuriya two. So, once again the Rev. Fr. Don George trophy went in favor of the Sylvestrians.

Pakistan Women in nail-biting win
After a clean-sweep in the One-Day Internationals (ODIs), Pakistan Women started the Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is) series with a nail-biting one-wicket win over Sri Lanka Women at the SSC grounds yesterday.
The bowlers restricted the hosts to 124 and the in-form Javeria Khan scored her third T20I fifty to seal the victory.
Pakistan won the toss and Bismah Maroof inserted the home side into bat. The opening bowlers - Diana Baig and Sana Mir justified the decision by running through the top order. Sri Lanka found themselves reeling at 38 for 5 before a partnership between Anushka Sanjeewani and Nilakshi de Silva bailed them out of trouble.
Having lost their best batter and captain Chamari Atapattu cheaply, the onus was on Sanjeewani to carry the batting burden. She did not find an able ally until de Silva walked in at number seven. The pair started the rebuilding process in a steady manner before gathering steam towards the end, a 58-ball 61 from Sanjeewani and the 84-run partnership which took just 68 balls gave Sri Lanka a competitive total.
Pakistan did not get off to the best of starts either - losing their openers inside four overs and the score reading 19. However, the experienced duo of Maroof and Javeria counter-attacked to take the momentum away from the hosts.
The 60-run association came in quick time and had brought the asking rate below run-a-ball.
Sri Lanka fought back by sending Maroof to the hut and picking wickets at regular intervals, but Javeria held one end up as Pakistan slipped from 79/2 to 96/5. Sugandika Kumari, who had picked up two wickets, came back to trap Javeria LBW off the penultimate ball of her spell and Mir was run-out, the very next ball.
The match headed towards a nail-biting finish as Sri Lanka needed three wickets while Pakistan still had nine runs to chase, with three overs remaining. The 18th and 19th over yielded only five runs and the visitors lost a wicket as well.
The nerves got to the Pakistan lower order as they lost another batter through a run-out. With four needed off four, Ghulam Fatima collected a brace and a boundary off the fourth and fifth ball to seal the victory in favour of Pakistan.
Scores:
Sri Lanka Women 129/6 in 20 (Anushka Sanjeewani 61, Nilakshi de Silva 35; Diana Baig 2/18, Sana Mir 2/25)
Pakistan Women 133/9 in 19.5 overs (Javeria Khan 52; Bismah Mahroof 42, Sugandika Kumari 3/23)

Pandemonium reins at Maskeliya Pradeshiya Sabha
Police had to be summoned to restore order to the inaugural meeting of the Maskeliya Pradeshiya Sabha held at the Ambal hall to elect the Chairman and Vice Chairman, which ended up in a clash between the Ceylon Workers Congress supporters and Jathika Kamkaru Sangamaya supporters outside the venue, yesterday.
When the meeting started, presided by Central Province Local Government Commissioner Menaka Herath, all 7 CWC members and 6 of the 7 UNP members were present. The CWC proposed G. Sembalawalli for the post of Chairman and she was elected uncontested as no other names were proposed for the post.
Thereafter, the SLFP appointed member P. Periyanan Pradeepan was elected uncontested as the Vice Chairman as no other names were proposed. Thereafter, the six members of the Jathika Kamkaru Peramuna representing the UNP submitted a letter to the Local Government Commissioner protesting against the election of the Chairman alleging that one member appointed to its list from the UNP had been abducted by the CWC group and the election was illegal. However, the Commissioner maintained that the election was legal as 8 members were present to fulfill the quorum.
Thereafter, members of the Jathika Kamkaru Peramuna conducted a protest campaign outside the 'Ambal' hall with their supporters obstructing the access road to the Maskeliya town and the Maskeliya-Samimale road.
This led to a clash between the CWC supporters and Jathika Kamkaru Sangamaya supporters hurling bricks and stones against each other. Several people were injured in the attack.
A police team deployed by Hatton SP Ravindra Ambepitiya managed to restore order. Several police teams were also deployed in the Maskeliya town to maintain law and order.
The national organiser of the Kamkaru Jathika Peramuna Kanapathi Naguleswaran speaking to the media said they would go to Courts and seek a remedy against the injustice caused by certain politicians.

Parents must pay more attention to children - President
A special programme will be introduced for parents urging them to pay more attention to their children, thereby protecting them from various forms of harassment and child abuse, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President was speaking at the centenary celebration meeting of Fathima Muslim Ladies College, Colombo at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre yesterday.
President Sirisena added that it is the duty of parents to take measures to protect children from falling victim to various forms of dangers.
Under this move, the Government has decided to conduct awareness programmes for parents, the President noted.
The President said, it is reported that a number of Grade Five students, who fail at the Grade Five Scholarship Examinations are harassed by their parents. That is because some parents are unaware of what the Grade Five Scholarship Examination is really all about.
I firmly believe that the Grade Five Scholarship Examination is not the turning point of a students academic career, President Sirisena noted.
The President further said that students should qualify not only by overcoming various academic barriers and passing examinations, but should also achieve success in the journey of life.
One of the prime objectives of the Government is to provide maximum educational benefits to students, President Sirisena said. The President said that measures will be taken to offer a plot of land belonging to the Urban Development Authority to Fathima College for the schools further expansion.
President Sirisena said large budgetary allocations for education and health should be considered as an investment. Millions of Rupees is invested annually to develop health and education facilities.
The President said education is not merely gaining qualifications but inculcating citizens with human values for the benefit of the country.
President Sirisena said students have to use modern technology as part of their progress.The President requested students to make the best out of modern technology in a productive manner.
Facebook and some other forms of social media have become a hindrance to ethnic harmony,the President said.
We temporary banned Facebook with the recent incidents in the Kandy district. The decision was highly condemned by a few. But most of the people in society including parents and elders highly appreciated that decision saying that it was a timely and valuable one required to protect the countrys good name, he said.
President Sirisena said several foreign organisations,which work on monitoring and evaluating social media and websites have praised the Governments decision to protect ethnic harmony.

'Poaching continues unabated'
Poaching continues unabated at forest reserves of the Hambantota district, residents of the area said. They added that poachers set up traps with the use of cables or by poisoning small bodies of water from which wild animals quench their thirst. Residents said a body of a pregnant deer was discovered in the Panwewa area. It had been caught in a trap. Even wild elephants often fall prey to those traps, they added.
As such traps had also claimed the lives of cattle that stray into forest areas, the curd industry in the district currently faces hardships as well, they added. Poaching activities had been on the rise, owing to the high demand for wild animal meat from star-class hotels and restaurants in the district.

Politically charged sensationalism
We are inclined to believe that the present political drama is, in part, a creation of the lopsided and skewed media culture that we now witness. In general, the present day media are accustomed to highlighting and blowing all the negative issues out of proportion at the expense of countrys economy, development efforts, ethical and value systems.
They seem to have mastered Gobellism and Sensationalism more than following media ethics and are hell-bent on bloating a bunch of unreliable, political liars who have no principles, values, ethics or morals, with their main headlines and prime time news.
Positive thinking and patriotism
They aggravate political rivalry and add fuel to fire without dwelling on conflict resolution. They hold their microphones to talkative, egoistic politicians who seek nothing but power and publicity. Some channels engage in ugly personal vendettas and witch hunts.
In the process, they make demigods of satanic politicians. They hardly highlight the exemplary deeds and acts of other personalities worthy of emulation. Can children and simple citizens look up to any of the present day politicians to develop positive thinking and patriotism
We are at a loss to understand why the media is brazenly continuing to force-feed the people with liberal doses of unbalanced, political bunkum and blood-curdling incidents and accidents that will never help to develop this country or build a patriotic citizenry.
Even developed countries do not resort to this so-called liberal media culture that makes scapegoats of simple people who are compelled to feed on and digest this unbridled news fodder!
Freedom of expression
If our country is to emerge out of this pathetic morass, our present political and media culture should undergo a paradigm shift, in order to prioritize and highlight more positive facets of life that promote country's development efforts and value systems for the people.
Since freedom of expression is projected as an undeniable right, we exhort on intelligent, patriotic media and citizens with the country at heart to facilitate this much-needed change by setting an example and applying relentless pressure.

Programme to donate organs of brain dead patients to be introduced
The government has taken steps to introduce a national programme to allow brain dead patients donate their organs for transplant purposes.
Brain dead patients who are on life support, could donate their organs for organ transplant operations for those in need. This system has been in operation around the world. Kidneys, hearts, liver, lungs, sections of the bowel, sections of the eye, skin, veins, tendons, bones, valves in the heart and pancreas, are all possible organs that could be donated. A Cabinet Paper put forward by Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, however, asked that a national programme and mechanism be set up to permit citizens to express whether they wish to become organ donors after their death.
The Minister had earlier proposed that people be allowed to state whether they are organ donors or not when obtaining ones drivers license and that would be indicated in ones license. This however is a voluntary gesture and officials at the Motor Traffic Department have been known to make no effort to inform applicants of this option. At present, close to 750 - 1,000 people die each year, without their organs being harvested for better purposes. Motor vehicle accidents which have a high rate of brain dead patients, have approximately 2,500 people die of accidents in Sri Lanka every year.In countries such as Australia, France and Lebanon, a national database of donors have been set up, permitting hospitals quick access to organs when they are ready.
They also allow people to register with this national database through the internet, phone and SMS services.

Sixty Lankan smokers die daily
Sixty Sri Lankans die daily due to smoking while annually 15,000 to 20,000 Sri Lankans die due to various health complications developed due to smoking, a Senior Lecturer in Health Promotion attached to the Rajarata University said.
Addressing a meeting held at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka in connection with Sri Lanka Laryngectomees Association yesterday, he said that annually six million people in the world die due to various health complications caused due to smoking.
This is a significant threat to the health of all people living in the world.
According to Dr. Fernando, cigarette smoke contains 30 cancerous substances while alcohol contains one cancerous substance. Aginomoto contains one cancerous substance.
Therefore, there is no other substance in the world as dangerous as cigarette smoke.
According to the Head of the ENT Unit of the Colombo National Hospital Dr. Chandra Jayasuriya, people who smoke, alcoholics, traders, bus conductors, school/tution class teachers, lawyers etc are at risk of developing Larynx cancer.
"Persons with Larynx cancers should undergo surgery in order to avoid further complications and to save lives. After surgery they can use an Electro Larynx or a Tracheo Oesophageal Speaking Valve to speak," she added.

Smiths legacy undone by improper sticky tape
JOHANNESBURG, Wednesday - A photograph posted on Twitter of Steve Smiths autobiography The Journey in the True Crime section of a Brisbane bookstore cruelly sums up the spectacular self-destruction of one of modern crickets most illustrious careers.
Irrespective of whether he dons the fabled baggy green cap again, Smith has already checked in at Australian crickets hall of shame next to Trevor Chappell, whose underarm delivery in 1981 is considered the nadir of the game Down Under.
Few expected the career of Australias Ashes-winning captain to unravel in such spectacular fashion but signs of a demise had already been evident last year when Smith underwent what he called a brain fade in India.
The visiting captain triggered a storm by looking towards the Australian dressing room in the second test in Bengaluru, seeking guidance whether to review his lbw decision in a clear breach of the players code of conduct.
The bad blood it created overshadowed the series but even that indiscretion paled in comparison with what transpired in Cape Town on Saturday, where Smith presided over an orchestrated attempt to both tamper with the ball and the spirit of the game.
Both incidents illustrate Smiths desperation to win at all costs, a philosophy that eventually cost him what otherwise would have been a great legacy of Australias Ashes-winning captain.
For in Smith, Australia boasted a stirring leader who was also their batting mainstay  two roles the 28-year-old juggled with ridiculous ease.
Many even found inspiration in how a player selected as a leg-spinner who came in at number eight on his test debut eight years ago emerged as arguably the best batsman of his era.
I do feel for Steve Smith, former Australia captain Michael Clarke told Australias Channel Seven. Hundred percent he has made a major mistake and he and a lot of other people I think are going to have to suffer the consequences.
Thats fair enough. But I think its important that we do over time forgive as well, said Clarke, whom Smith succeeded as Australia captain.
Forgiveness may not come easy, though.
The scandal has already forced several sponsors to review their association with Australias favourite pastime and infuriated Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and other less prominent fans.
In a single, ill-conceived stroke, Smith has ensured that his 31 international centuries, stints at the top of the batting rankings and inspired leadership in a successful Ashes campaign will not linger in public memory.
Instead, a second brain fade ensured Smith would be remembered more as the architect-in-chief of a dirty trick using dirt and some sticky tape, which only succeeded in causing the downfall of someone who put winning above everything else.  Agencies

But as a result of the war, the education sector in the North was paralyzed largely due to the lack of physical resources and valuable human resources, the Prime Minister said.
He further said that the entire education system in Jaffna had completely collapsed. Therefore, we have to take basic measures to uplift Jaffnas education sector. It will take nearly 10 years to achieve this target. A special education mechanism should be introduced for Jaffna with the assistance of retired teachers and principals.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said the government wants to improve the countrys education system without any discrimination. During the past few years, a number of measures had been taken to solve major issues such as teacher shortage and the lack of physical resources in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
When the present government came in to power in 2015, only 60 percent of the countrys schools had electricity and we have been able to increase it up to 98 percent. School sanitary facilities have also been improved. Measures have also been taken to ensure 13 years of contributory school education and also to introduce 26 vocational subjects, Minister Kariyawasam said.
He further added that a revolution is happening in countrys education under the present government.
State Education Minister V.S. Radhakrishnan, Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray, Ministry Secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi also participated.

Traditions, Warriors and April priorities
The schools rugby season rolls on at its own furious pace ...pushing everything and anyone out of its packed path. Mesmerized media types rub shoulders with our resident experts/pundits...hoping for some sprinkling of Intel, relevant facts or development regarding players and their closest..
Potentially that spring is always flowing and full of huge opportunities for those who thrive on claptrap!
Traditionally its April and time to establish our playing pedigree based on pure performance in the early encounters, especially the big cup games ...either home or away.
Good to see the skills and level of work that stand the top teams apart from the others in the initial rounds, struggling to contain the more fluid front-runners...
Royal will be tested to the core by the Josephians, looking to set up their best season ever, and seem to have the class to do it......Havelock Park will burst at their seams ...a full house expected, both teams free of major injury concerns and hungry to get down to dominating play. Both unbeaten and fancy their chances to lead group 1A.
Friday 6 April @ Havies Stadium 4.30pm kick off.
The other humdinger is on Saturday, also at Havelock Park...where the green machine line up the Bamba brigade...for a traditional smash and grab affair....Isipatana v St Peters, both unbeaten and desperate to be the leader in group 2A.
Saturday 7 April @ Havelock Park 4.30pm kick off.
Early parking is advised, as the rush will be buzzing and thankfully the traffic wont be an issue to consider.
Arguably the Trinity v S. Thomas match should also sparkle beyond the touchline ...expect a bit of a trek, but well worth the trip to Pallekelle...Saturday 7 April, 4.30pm.
Lets leave the great expectations on hold and dive into some performance stats between the big 6 ...holding their own in the Singer league 2018 so far.
Great to see the Joes step up beyond conventional traditions and crunch a few acceptable standard results...especially their win against Trinity in Kandy...and spontaneous reactions under pressure.
Trinity for their unit work, looked solid in both the sets and in the open. Statswise pretty even on form ...but the telling lack of kicking and lapses in defence got Sheiks Lions into their first difficulty ...and the toughest pill to swallow at home.
But the result not isolated either...when a jubilant Kingswood held on for a win against Trinity and form last week 28-21...sheer disbelief.
Royal are into their stride, controlling play and dominating territory as per their set plan ...but all of that calm clear clinical set play, may be undone at the seams, and a less structured Joes get down to upsetting that Royal control in the middle.
Lewke will expect his boiler house boys to grind them in the front row and joy for cauliflower ears as proof ...in fact badges of courage for both front rows
Royal will want to slow things and use their superior weight to max use all over the park.
Joes and Nilufer as coach, have seen them crash thru sides this season....can they maintain that momentum against a bigger and more rugby ready side like Royal....Will they ignore the traditional form over so many years ... Can their backs step it up and shine slice their opposite numbers from set play... Do Joes have the pace to outrun Royal Burning questions indeed!
Experts please stand up and roll those pundits knowledge dice ...tell us who will be buzzing on Friday, tell us how effective their game plans will be and is it all about strategy...or down to sheer heart and will to succeed.....Reid avenue v Beira boys on a steamy Friday in the city by the sea at the Havies cauldron of pain....What a match it promises to be ...70minutes of absolutely no love lost and everything on the line ...rugby hearts, warm up and strength for the occasion!
Patanas green machine is all on traditional inspiration and whatever they are up against....an example of dedication and commitment that has been jealously guarded over many decades....
History will dictate that to play them and beat them is a massive task and always an achievement.
But Peters are buzzing this season and pre season prep with coach Martis, quite the thing to incite furious speculation.
Have they been tested ...Is Patana quicker in the loose Game plans and SPC discipline v Patana heart and hunger ...
Either way its down to a 100% commitment from both units and full on pace from kick off to full time - 70minutes of oxygen friendly bubbling adrenaline to fuel the mind and body.
Spectators be warned, its not going to be smooth passage either way ...its all or nothing, and down to the wire.
What a fabulous break for our island schools warriors this weekend as April announces its arrival and the Singer league takes a weeks break.
Ideal time for teams to assess their performance, check on positions, efficiency, stats and strategy....most importantly, time for those injuries to heal plus some more time for recovery and rehabilitation.
One cannot emphasize more about the need for players and injuries to have their time on the table ...rest, recover, heal, ice bath, release, massage, switch off, recharge, revive and back in the middle...fresh and hungry ...Good calories and mind clear for maximum intensity.
School rugby is certainly our flagship and beacon of interest for fans, school kids, old boys and families to fanatically follow the code...if in doubt....zip along to Havelock Park for big leader clash groups 1A Josephs vs Royal......then 2A  Peters vs Patana.
The atmosphere is certainly beyond conventional and closer to electric for sure.
About time school rugby was eased away from the traditional stable of Ministry scrutiny and given a total professional overhaul from head to toe .....Sri rugby a bigger stake in the game and its future direction.
School rugby needs to evolve and give our warriors a fair shot at Asian domination for starters....the time has come, the walrus said ...
Enjoy the break islanders, stretch the mind, rest the body and muscles ready for the absolute intensity of matches lining up in April.
Its an all or nothing theory...so pressure up for max confrontation...
Stay strong, mind up and hearts on fire.
Blessings and rest to all players this weekend.
Cheers islanders...Bula Bula Sri!

Turnaround Management a contemporary tool for business revival
Majority of businesses face business turbulences frequently and are subject to many hardships and challenges to reach their corporate goals and long term vision. These challenges will come from both internally and externally to businesses and at times come from the negligence of directors, management, staff, workers and suppliers. Some businesses are family owned ones and have no future vision at all. Unlike foreign business ventures Sri Lankan business ventures neglect their priorities in the wake of a large number of holidays enjoyed by the state, banking and private sector. This is a major drawback for especially the private sector of this country. Overall Productivity levels of the country is at a low ebb when compared with other developing countries. Often, work targets are not specified and the work loads are not demanding ones.
Some of the drawback factors are enumerated below:
* Loss of market shares and the absence of continuity of markets
* Cost escalations of resources
*State legislation and local by-laws
* Unexpected competition from both local/overseas business houses
* Plant and Machinery breakdowns
* Higher distribution and marketing costs
* Trade union action
* Acis of God
* Internal and external whistle blowing
* High labour and staff turnover especially the skilled ones
* High fixed overheads and escalation of same
* Lower profit margins and contributions
* Disruptions to Infra Structure facilities frequently such as power failures
* Internal disputes among the directors and management
* Intra-Individual & inter group conflicts
The directors and the management may not know the problems within their organization until embarrassing situations surface at a much later date. However, if there are solid good governance measures in force, the turnaround management will come from within from the directors, Top/Middle/Lower level management or based from the suggestions of others like suppliers and customers. In the absence of good governance measures, the turnaround management is most likely to come from an external source, either from an external organization, from a team of turnaround consultants or from a single turnaround specialist.
Turnaround management could be defined as the regaining of former business position which is directed towards corporate renewal. It employs Analysis and Planning to save troubled companies and bring such companies back to solvency and also identify the reasons for business failures with a view of rectifying them.
Turnaround Management involves:
* Management Review for the last 5 years at least
* Root Failure Cause Analysis
* Swot Analysis based on present business platform
* Assessment of key and contributory factors for Revival
* Reaching consensus on reforms needed and the time table for same
After this, a long term plan takes shape and will be documented with Short/Medium/Long term targets and execution of plans.
Turnaround professionals/Managers play a vital part in the preparation and execution of all plans until goals are achieved. Adjustments to plans are devised from time to time based on current business environment. Usually, Turnaround Management takes place until a business returns to normalcy and solvency. Turnaround managers are often called Turnaround specialists or practitioners and often work on Assignment basis and their contract period can take from 2 to 24 months. However, the time period depends on the complexity and urgency of the job, parameters involved and size of the organization & geographical dispersion.
Turnaround Management is also closely associated with:
* Change Management
* Transformation Management
* Post-Merger Integration Management
Commonly, the present Turnaround Managers provide a one- stop-shop service and arrange much needed funding also for the Turnaround Assignment. They work closely with Banks/Financial Instituitions and Private Equity Funds, Unit Trusts, Venture Capital Companies and also arrange syndicated loans spreading the risks. They also arrange ancillary professional service providers such as Corporate Lawyers and Insolvency Practitioners to have direct access to a wide and complete range of services which may be required for the assignment taken over by them.
In a more practically oriented format, Turnaround Management will include the following stages:
*Examination, Assessment and Evaluation Stage
* Assessment of core areas and key factors
* Restructuring Stage
* Stabilization Stage
* Re-Vitalization Stage
* Review of Success
* Making additional inputs to the systems and corrective action
* Feed Back and innovation
Turnaround Managers/Practitioners will take over the management and decision making control and virtually function as Chief Executive Officers until the assignment is complete depending on circumstances. Alternatively, they can advise the same management that failed before that invited them.
One of the most difficult tasks for Turnaround Managers will be to get rid of the existing executives/staff/workers who have put the company into the present position as they will resist change for their own financial/other benefits which they now enjoy at the expense of the company.
They may well be employed in fraudulent practices and sometimes are closely connected to the directors/management. Directors who have direct and indirect interest in contracts of the company may also be an obstructing force as the directors gain at the expense of the company. Success of a business rests entirely with the directors & top management. They should devise contingency strategies to avoid losses which affect the  Going Concern Concept of a corporate entity. The shareholders should remove the offending directors with the interest of a long term vision. The suppliers of a company can also create havoc in a company in the long term by over-pricing of the products/services to the company, possibly in collusion with company staff members. This will result in profit leaking in a company.
Given below is a check-list of points for scrutiny by the Turnaround Managers:
* Present and Past profit margins & contributions
* Fixed Overhead Analysis over the years
* Perusal of Directors/Shareholders minutes over the years to ascertain the decisions taken
* Tax files of the company to ascertain taxes paid, matters in dispute and future liabilities
* Credit control measures and credit periods
* Cash Flow statements
* Audited Accounts & qualifications of Auditors
* Latest draft Accounts with all Balance Sheet Schedules with an Age Analysis
* Fixed Asset Utilisations/Acquisitions/Disposals
* Stock Levels maintained and stock records
* Market shares for products/services with a present survey on customer preferences
* Ascertainment of excess/unproductive staff after a Time study and a Work study exercise
* Perusal of minutes of all management meetings to identify responsibility centres
* Internal Audit reports
* Review of all incentive schemes employed and in force
* Attendance Records and meetings with HR manager
* Ascertainment of present liability of staff as to the benefits accrued
* Checking of industry statistics as to staff/worker remuneration, productivity, profitability, etc
* Log sheets and costs of transport division
* Instances of non compliance with local government by laws and penalties paid
* A ratio analysis of expenses and profit margins and a comparison with the industry
* Evaluation of cost control measures
* Level of Budgetary/Financial control exercised over the years
* A present SWOT Analysis vis a vis the main competitors
* An energy consumption & energy cost audit
* Technical standards and accreditations for products/services
Above are only a few points and the evaluations will vary based on gravity of matters involved.
The Turnaround specialists must within a short period of time analyse the requirements of the Assignment and plan their work accordingly and inform the management and discuss terms for completion of assignment. A Preliminary evaluation report will prove useful in this context.
Turnaround Specialists/Managers have following courses of action after the preliminary evaluation:
* Decide on a working plan and a time table to resurrect the company
* Sale of the business/company as a going concern entity
* Negotiating a Management Buy-Out
* Selection of additional funding modes
* Decision on Liquidation---voluntary/compulsory
* Merger with another business entity
* Strategic Alliance with a local/foreign company
* Handing over the entire management to an investment fund or similar organisation
Whatever the decision, it should be first approved by the board of Directors and then by the shareholders by resolutions at meetings.
Let us now consider a few practical issues for arising of need for a Business Turnaround. Some business enterprises fall into difficulty in trying to expand, diversify, innovate the existing products or increase the product range.
A classic example of a business of such nature is where in a family owned business, the children taking over the business from their father, run into difficulty due to loss of market shares. The chidren possibly with overseas education may try to innovate and break into the export market or to expand local market shares without carrying out extensive research. This process will involve substantial new capital. In the absence of liquid funds within the company, the children may go in for debt at substantial interest. If they fail to get customer acceptance/approval for the innovated product locally and/or they fail to capture a sizable market share overseas, the company will not be able to recoup the additional capital costs incurred on new plant/machinery and promotional costs and will not be able to service the debt.
As a result, the unpaid interest and debt capital will mount possibly putting pressure on the assets pledged and/or guarantees given by the company. This may well include the personal guarantees given by the directors. After some time, being unable to come to terms with the situation, the board of directors may well call for external Turnaround consultants to reverse the trends with mounting pressure also from the bankers for repayment of borrowings.
A Substantial part of the Turnaround costs will include the retrenchment costs of staff possibly with a VRS scheme (Voluntary Retirement Scheme) This will also come in for pressure and opposition from the trade unions with the backing of area politicians. Recruitment of new staff should be postponed until the excess/unproductive staff members/workers are properly retrenched. Otherwise, they may well create a chaotic situation by forcing the new workers to resist from exercising their official duties properly by misleading them or by using physical force.
Repositioning
This activity will be preceded by extensive research on all key factors such as customers, markets, profit margins, taxes, product innovations, decisions on new debt/equity capital, introduction of new incentive schemes, marketing strategies. are planned, executed and solid results are achieved.
The companies should aim for Repositioning on a medium term basis with the hard work coming in the short term.
Additional funds if needed could be found by listing the shares in the stock market. If the turnaround process is successful, the company could well pay off additionally borrowed funds with improved turnover, higher profits, an IPO (Initial Public Offering) and through rights issues later through the stock exchange.

When evil prevails
Jesus had not had any rest nor had any food for some time when he was unjustly arrested, judged, sentenced to death on a cross and then stripped of his clothes, scourged, crowned with thorns, spat upon, mocked and made to carry the cross to Golgotha to be crucified. The agony preceding his arrest, the unbearable sufferings he underwent, the degrading crucifixion, death and resurrection became the foremost events that occupied the minds of his twelve Apostles and the first disciples.
They became the prominent elements of their first proclamations on Jesus. As such the last days of Jesus preceding his death have got recorded in some detail in the New Testament the reliable historical witnesses to the harrowing events of the suffering and the crucifixion of Jesus. Crucifixion was a form of punishment taken over from the Persians by the Romans who added to it further forms of torture to make it more painful and heinous.
Not only the New Testament writers, but also non-Christian Romans and other Jews have testified to the death of Jesus by crucifixion and the worship given to him by his followers, the Christians. Among them is Josephus the Jewish historian who around 93 AD stated that Pontius Pilate had Jesus, a wise man to whom was attracted both Jews and Gentiles, put to death by crucifixion at the instigation of the chief men in our midst.
NOT WHETHER BUT WHY JESUS DIED
It is therefore unreasonable for anyone seven centuries later or in our own day to say without reliable evidence something that is contrary to history and as to what actually happened and presume to say that Jesus of Nazareth did not die crucified on the gibbet of the cross. Today, most scholars do not question whether Jesus died on the cross. In fact at the end of a dialogue among Jews, Muslims and Christians in Ramallah just four years ago, Prof. Ravi Zacharias in the company of a prominent Sheik asserted that we are standing not far from the place where Jesus was crucified and died and it is time that we give up asking whether he died by crucifixion and began asking why he died so. The Sheik did not contest that. And there are many other Muslim scholars today who do not deny the death of Jesus by crucifixion.
TO SERVE, NOT TO BE SERVED
Jesus, when he said, I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full (John 10.10), The Son of Man came not to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many (Mark 10:45), I have come to cast a fire on earth, and I wish it were already burning! (Luke 12.49), he proclaimed the meaning of his life as a life meant to give a new meaning and a fullness of the life of others and to imbue it with the richness of selfless love. Until the world discovers the fire of love that Jesus brought to earth that extinguishes all manner of torching, arson and scorching, mankind will from time to time envelop itself in devastating conflagrations.
Explaining Jesus attitude to life, Paul said to the Philippian Christian followers Jesus, being in his very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to cling to, to be used to his own advantage; instead, of his own free will he gave up all he had and took the nature of a servant. He became like a man and appeared in human likeness. He was humble and walked the path of obedience all the way to death  his death on the cross. (Pauls Letter to the Philippians 2.6-8). Jesus did not count equality with God as something to be tightly grasped and held as a privilege of immunity from want, deprivation, tiresomeness, hunger, thirst and every human limitation.
Even in the midst of suffering, he did not revile anyone; he only prayed to God saying, Father, forgive them for they do not know what they do (Gospel of Luke 23.34). Jesus, though he had committed no sin, suffered an agony and died because sinful men plot to destroy good people not being able to tolerate what a good person does.
MANY SLOW TO LEARN
Today, how many would grab and cling to privileges denying even human rights of other people The powerful men of today too refuse to learn what the Noble Teachers of old have taught. The world including the nations with Christian roots have not learned the lessons of the Cross and have not only sacrificed millions of human beings in internecine warfare for power, position and prestige, but they together with many other nations are also spending trillions of dollars for training and preparing for war saying they are just being ready for defence.
The intelligence of the power gets devoted to inventing more sophisticated instruments, stratagems and tactics of war. Training for the war conducted in military academies in all rich and poor nations is a constituent part of all governments. And Field Marshalls, Five-star Generals, Air Marshalls, Admirals are dressed up in glamorous uniforms as leaders of war, as if warring, destroying by bombing whole cities and annihilating whole nations a very honourable and respectable profession; so much so that men in the armed forces are supposed to wear their warrior uniforms even to celebrating their very important festive day, the day of their wedding. Nevertheless, the commanders who lead men to war have a nagging in their heart that many of the men they send will be killed.
Human beings capacity for unheard of evil lay before our eyes in the ways of causing hunger, thirst and malnutrition among millions of people, displacement and homelessness among other millions, the senseless devastation of property and annihilation of the innocent and the readiness to destroy the planet earth itself. But leaders of humanity have not yet begun even to explore the many dimensions and possibilities of living in a community of love. Humanity has not yet begun to sufficiently explore the many dimensions and possibilities of love.
They gather as United Nations, Commonwealth, Organizations of Non-Aligned Nations, African States, American States, Davos Group and other groups with various names only to make some make-shift arrangements over problematic relations among nations, trade and commerce, banking and finance, economic recession and growth. Military build-ups and production of means of mass destruction contradict the policies regarding education, health, agriculture and productivity and progress of nations.
Those at the summits of power have neither begun to understand the meaning of human civilization nor ventured sufficiently to explore the possibilities of international peace and peace within nations. Probing and investigating elimination of hate and the many dimensions of education in cooperation, solidarity and love are furthest from their minds whereas they remain the basis of human survival.
UNDERSTANDING THE GREAT TEACHERS
Neither Jesus Christ nor Gautama Buddha came or went about dressed in military or imperial attire. Not having properly learned and understood what they taught, many things have not only got cockeyed within our countries but gone wrong with the human race itself. Humankinds governing powers have not yet learned that when even a small group of men do not stand to reason, they could descend to the depths of evil and drag many to despair and even crucify God himself as the mob led by chief priests did that Friday in Jerusalem. They have also not yet learned that Jesus love could be so boundless that in spite of the malice, wickedness, corruption and sin of the human beings, he remains forgiving, compassionate, faithful and loving to the very end of his life. It is for this reason that the Cross has become a sign of Gods unfathomed love and the possibility that love conquers even death.
A man should learn that in every human being, love remains a living divine spark within, capable of being fanned into a flame that could not only absorb without even a murmur every torture, evil, sin and death itself but express a genuine undying love, like the love of Jesus crucified. When humanity learns and understands that lesson, that will be the day of peace and true victory not just for the privileged under a so-called superpower but for all mankind.

To win 2020 Presidential election:
A young common candidate must be groomed: Champika
Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Patali Champika Ranawaka said that a young common candidate should be nominated for the 2020 Presidential election to win the election.
The Minister said so addressing the gathering at the sworn in ceremony of the newly elected Local Government Councillors yesterday, at the Mahaweli Centre in Colombo. He said the votes of the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party(SLFP) broke away during Local Government elections as the people were disappointed with the present government.
According to the electoral results, it clearly shows that the people have given less importance to main parties and have chosen other parties instead, while now there was a tendency of new people being chosen by the public, he said. The Minister further said that Mahinda Rajapaksas vote base was reduced in the recent Local Government election, compared to the elections held in 2005, 2010 and 2015.
He noted that the government while changing its ways of conduct, should also take immediate measures for the development of the country.
Minister Ranawaka said that if the UNP did not take progressive decisions, it would end up as Communist and leftist parties in Sri Lanka.
Communist and Leftist parties were unable to survive after the demise N. M. Perera, Colvin R de Silva and Bernand Soysa. They kept on talking about their successful past and never took any initiative to safeguard their party or the country, he said.
The Minister said that they would take initiatives to make necessary changes if the UNP failed to do so.
If the UNP does not take measures to change not only their political policies, but also the economic perspective, we would take initiatives to create a change, he said.
Minister Ranawaka insisted that all parties, including the SLFP and UNP, should handover the responsibility to young people to take decisions and to witness a positive change in the country.
He said that the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU), was not a party that gave false promises to the people.
It proved its ability through action and requested the councilors to continue to serve the people.

Reverend Warners heavy price for win at all costs preaching
JOHANNESBURG, Wednesday: Damned as the chief plotter in the Australian ball-tampering scandal, David Warner has been sunk by sparking one controversy too many.
The man who made headlines in 2009 by becoming the first player in 130 years to represent Australia without having featured in a first-class match was heading home from South Africa in disgrace on Wednesday, friendless and with his reputation, already bruised by numerous run-ins, shattered.
Along with skipper Steve Smith, the 31-year-old Warner was banned for a year by Cricket Australia for his part in the third Test scandal in Cape Town that saw Cameron Bancroft use sandpaper to illegally scuff up the ball before a laughingly crude attempt to conceal the evidence down his trousers.
"He (Warner) spoke with Cameron (Bancroft) in the change room while Smith was otherwise engaged, seemingly with a lot on his mind," a Cricket Australia source told AFP, recalling Saturday's events at Newlands.
"I believe Smith knew something was going on, but did not try to find out exactly what."
For many in the game, Warner's involvement as the instigator of the lunchtime plot is hardly a surprise.
"David Warner is a hard man to keep quiet. If his bat isn't doing the talking his mouth probably is, and either way you can expect an assertive approach," is how respected website cricinfo opens its biography of the opening batsman. In June 2013, Warner was suspended and fined for punching England's Joe Root in a Birmingham bar on the eve of the Ashes.
"I'm extremely remorseful. I have let my team-mates, Cricket Australia, the fans, myself and my family down," said Warner. Two months earlier, he was similarly contrite after an ugly Twitter spat with two Australian journalists.
"I could have chosen my words better and I apologise for any offence that my language may have caused," wrote Warner. But his trademark combative nature never dimmed.
Last year, he was the team's unofficial shop steward as Australian players and governing body Cricket Australia found themselves at loggerheads over a pay dispute.
The row, played out in the public arena, even briefly put the Ashes in doubt. Warner defended his style, which even then hinted at an ability to shout louder than the boyish-looking Smith, who preferred quiet diplomacy.
"The way he (Smith) went about it (talks between the players and CA) was how he wanted to play it and I was always going to come out and be vocal and sticking up for the players," Warner told Australian media.
Hardly surprising then that Warner, who was vice-captain to Smith with the national team, has been nicknamed 'The Reverend'. Not that there was any indication of anything holy about him as he led Australia's assault on the current, doomed South African tour.
In the opening Test in Durban, he and home wicket-keeper Quinton de Kock squared up.
Warner claimed De Kock had made "vile and disgusting" remarks about his wife Candice.
Warner was fined 75 percent of his match fee and De Kock 25 percent.
The Cape Town scandal has already brought Warner financial misery, his $1.8 million (1.45m euros) deal with Hyderabad Sunrisers in the IPL cancelled. When his ban ends, his dream of captaining Australia will also have died. Whether or not he will be considered too toxic to add to his 74 Test appearances and 6,000-plus runs will be a factor weighed against him.
'The Reverend', it appears, has become 'The Unwanted'. - AFP

## Title: Schoolboy Cricketer title, dream of all school cricketers

Former award winner Sanath Jayasuriya pays rich tribute to Mega Show:
Schoolboy Cricketer title, dream of all school cricketers
Ex-Sri Lanka captain and former Chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriya said an outstanding youngster winning the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title stands a big chance of playing for Sri Lanka after their school career.
The Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award would elevate young players, giving them a greater chance of playing for Sri Lanka once they leave school. Winning that award is no easy task, score over 1000 runs or capture over 100 wickets. When you see the star schoolboy cricketers who had won this prestigious award in the past, it is evident that most of them have ended up with the national team and underlined their supremacy in the international arena. This title takes talented schoolboy cricketers a step towards a place in the Sri Lanka team, Jayasuriya said in a recent interview.
Paying a rich tribute to Lake House for conducting the event for 40 long years, the explosive former Sri Lanka batsman said the mega title he won in 1988 as an emerging player from St. Servatius College, Matara was a great source of encouragement and inspiration.
Jayasuriya recalled his early days as a schoolboy cricketer at St. Servatius, Jayasuriya, adding that the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title has remained the dream of every schoolboy cricketer from the good old days.
When I won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year outstation title, I thought I should stand a greater chance of playing for Sri Lanka, if I continue to focus on the game with dedication and devotion. It inspired me to go places, Jayasuriya recalled.
Once you win this coveted title, you only need commitment and dedication to find a place in the Sri Lanka team, told the Daily News in an interview.
Jayasuriya said that the countrys school cricket structure, once considered to be the best in the world, needs a complete overhaul to meet todays challenges.
The winner of the prestigious Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year (Outstation) award in 1988, Jayasuriya said the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) and Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) should make a joint effort to uplift the standard of local school cricket.
The master blaster who was adjudged the Most Valuable Player of the Series in Sri Lankas 1996 World Cup triumph said the new Under-19 tournament structure of the SLSCA should be reviewed to focus more on producing quality cricketers to the national pool. In our era, we only had 12 first X1 inter-school matches. But now, some schools play over 20 inter-school matches in each season, including their third term matches. Thats too much. Scoring 1,000 runs in 20 to 24 matches in not a big deal, compared to the 10 to 12 matches most school played in the past, he warned.
Im not saying the present tournament structure is bad. It has given an opportunity to some top school teams in the outstations to play against the leading Colombo schools. Thats a positive sign. But at the same time, I have some concern about the competitiveness and standard of cricket that is dished out in some matches, he said.
We see too much of school cricket now  so many matches for a team to honour during a season. That does not sound good for the game. I think the school cricket authorities have been working on to overcome these problems. They have a big responsibility and a big role to play to further improve our school cricket standards, Jayasuriya said.
However, the former chief selector said the standard of the countrys school cricket has not dropped. I dont think that the standard has dropped. It has not improved from the level it was, compared to other teams in the world. It has stagnated, instead of going further up from the point we were. We must pay attention to that, he added.
When Sri Lankas school cricket structure and the standard was considered to be the best in the world a couple of decades back, India was far below us. But now, India has a good under-19 structure. A couple of other Test nations have made vast improvements in their youth teams. We need to change our strategies and restructure our tournament to meet the future challenges in cricket, Jayasuriya said.
Paying a glowing tribute to the Sunday Observer and Lake House for conducting the countrys first-ever school cricket awards show for four decades, Jayasuriya said every schoolboy who wins the prestigious Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award stands a good chance of representing the country, if they continue the game with dedication.
If you win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award, you stand a big chance of playing for Sri Lanka in the near future. It is not easy to win that award, score over 1000 runs or capture over 100 wickets. When you see the star schoolboy cricketers who had won this prestigious award in the past, it is evident that most of them have ended up with the national team and underlined their supremacy in the international arena. This title takes talented schoolboy cricketers a step towards a place in the Sri Lanka team, Jayasuriya said.
Jayasuriya, who has aggregated 13,430 runs including 28 centuries and 68 fifties and captured 323 wickets in 445 ODIs, said the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title is something unique and a cherished moment that any schoolboy cricketer could ever dream of.
It has remained the dream of every schoolboy cricketer then and now. Everybody knows that this award would make a schoolboy cricketer take a giant leap forward. It inspires you to do well when you step into club cricket from school level and to the national team thereafter, said the star batsman who had made an immense contribution to Sri Lanka cricket.
The 48-year-old one dashing dashing opener, who introduced the art of pinch -hitting during the 1996 World Cup tournament and underlined his supremacy as one of the best batsman in world cricket, has proved his class at Test cricket as well. Apart from his grand triple of 13,430 runs, 323 wickets and 123 catches to become probably the best ODI all-rounder ever in world cricket,
Jayasuriya had also been a classy batsman in the five-day Test game.
With a career-best innings of 340 against India, Jayasuriya has aggregated 6973 runs in 110 Tests, scoring 14 centuries and 31 half tons.
Meanwhile, voting for the most popular segments of the 40th Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest, conducted under three divisions, has reached its final lap with the traditional big match season. Voting coupons for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy
Cricketer of the Year contest continue to appear in the Daily News, Sunday Observer, Dinamina and Thinakaran.
Sri Lankas national mobile service provider, Sri Lanka Telecom Mobitel continues to provide that smart connection to the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest for the 11th successive year. Under the directions of the Chairman of Sri Lanka Telecom and SLT Mobitel PG
Kumarasinghe, the Chief Executive Officer of SLT Mobitel, Nalin Perera has made a lavish contribution towards the success of the event during the past decade.
Thanks to the longstanding association of the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA), the Sri Lanka Cricket Umpires and Scorers Association and Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), headed by Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala, the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest has gone from strength to strength.

Aged couple forced to make cave their home
An elderly couple, R.B. Dharmadasa and his wife J.H. Bandara Menike, have been living in a cave for the last 27 years for want of a house of their own.
The cave is situated near a chena named Konaneyaya in the Serathkada grama niladhari division in the Padiyatalawa DS division, nearly 8 km off Serathakada.
Dharmadasa said the wattle and daub house they were living in was destroyed during heavy rains in 1992 and since then they shifted into this cave, as they did not have funds to build a new house.
They have no income at present and make a living with the meagre Samurdhi allowance of Rs. 2,000 per month. Very often they had to skip meals due to their penury. Archaeology authorities have requested them to move out of the cave, but they are unable to accede to this request as they have nowhere to go.
They appeal to the public or social service organisations to provide a house for them.

Architecture is science
Imagine you're dashing through that lively spell of energy, in the blaze of the city, hearing dozens of elevator rings and expecting to grab a cocktail and jump into a big, comfortable bed at the end of the day.
A place for such rest and a getaway in the busy Colombo metropolis is Mvenpick hotel. Archworld spoke to Architect Murad Ismail, whose vision brought the 24 story hotel into life.
Mvenpick was originally designed for an apartment complex. It stands on a 90-perch, linear plot of land. It is a mid-riser building in the world's view and a high-riser in Sri Lanka.
"The view of the Northern side had to be blocked because it looked directly into Temple Trees," said Ismail. "And we concentrated on making the bedrooms remarkable -bathrooms with a view and corridors that meander around rather than thin and lengthy ones. We made the bedrooms with quite a large expanse of view -the sea view and city view," he said.

"What we're trying to create is a five plus standard hotel," said Ismail. It's a city hotel on a very small plot, going upward. It consists of a smaller reception and lobby area,and caters to three restaurants which, together with rooftop bar, invite not only in-house guests but guests from outside as well.The interior of the hotel was designed by a foreign interior design firm, together with the operators.
Mvenpick is a city business hotel. Basically, you need to be able to access the hotel, get into the lift, and go to your bedroom, explained Ismail. "Because you're not spending the time in your bedroom but in the city. When you come to the room, how comfortable you find it, how you enjoy the view in the morning is what counts."
"We tried to blend it with the fast developing Colombo skyline," said Ismail. "Colombo is a country within a country and it's going to be that way for a long time. There's an influx that's coming into Colombo. Population is going to increase and like in all cities, there's going to be high-rises and mid-rises around Colombo metropolis.
And if we did anything less than what we have done with Mvenpick, it wouldn't be worth having that 90 perch plot of land because of its cost."
"Once the building has to go up, you have to be very careful because we cannot lose our identity," stated Ismail. "Sri Lankan architecture is a mixture of farmer's hut and Dutch architecture. We are accepted around the world for our simple designs. And it's about keeping it simple and elegant."
Moving to a more tranquil picture, imagine yourself unpacking in a serene evening as the calming hum of wildlife whisper around you. You've shed the hustle and bustle in the city and entered the transforming wild -a swim in the sea, a sunset and a nap in the fresh wind.
Murad Ismail's imagination brought to life Jetwing Yala, a resort nestled in the charming wild.
Jetwing Yala is built on a linear strip of 38-acre land. It was built in 2004 after the tsunami devastation. "And due to reservations conferredat the time, 125-meter gap had to be left between the hotel and the beach," said Ismail.
"The situation of hotels in Yala is that, the guests cannot walk around the hotels after dark," noted Ismail."When designing Jetwing, I decided that it must be something of unique nature that also allows the guest to walk to the bars, restaurants, hang outs, balconies and terraces anytime of the day."
"We wanted the animals, including a family of leopards, to come into the gardens of the hotel from the scrub jungle," stated Ismail."And we have not disturbed the elephants from coming to the sea or right up to the dining area."
The expectation is to transform one or two night tourism and to make it a destination, creating a holiday for the guest that lasts more than a couple nights, said Ismail. "We concentrated on designing elegant bedrooms and a good dining experience with room in restaurants, terraces or in the lawn."
"It's not about just going to Yala; it's about going to spend time in a 38- acre property," explained Ismail. The spa is small but you could get massaged anywhere in the jungle. The beach is expected to be used for weddings and a nook has been allocated as a swimmable area and there is also a large swimming pool in the premises.
When you visit Jetwing Yala, "you may go to the game park and you also have tented camps on the side of the hotel," Ismail pointed out. If you're a guest and need privacy, the farthest, linear block of rooms allows you to drive your vehicle up to the entrance.
"People did not understand what we were doing," said Ismail. "They questioned about how environment-friendly it was and why chalets weren't designed."
"I moved away from the norms of chalets when designing Jetwing Yala because when you consider destination tourism as opposed to wildlife tourism, the guests prefer to walk around the hotel in the night, to have a drink and look at the sunset, and chalets restrict them from these activities," Ismail explained.
"Chalets are independent and would look environment friendly because they're small but the whole land would have needed to be cleared to build them in order to be able to walk from and to each chalet and the sides would have to be cleared for safety.So I stepped away from the idea to minimize the damage."
Environment-friendly moves together with sustainability. There's no point in building something for 50 years, with material that lasts for five years, remarked Ismail. "And spend so much chemical, material and human labour to maintain it. It is important to have sustainability with the lowest amount of maintenance to make the building last through its lifespan."
Jetwing Yala is a building that takes up 1/10 of its land. "We did not disturb anything there except where the building was coming," Ismail explained."We have replaced whatever had to be uprooted in shrub form. The plants are replaced on the building itself."
We meandered around trees and stilted the entire building and used the contours of land, he said further. All the rooms are designed to be looking through a gap between the dunes to the sea.
Jetwing Yala has sustainable energy. It makes its own energy with solar panels and cinnamon ferns.
"The one question I keep asking myself and answering is -forget the cost, forget the material- but why would someone come back here again for their next holiday" pointed out Ismail.
How would you achieve it "When you go to a hotel or a resort to relax, you should not spend more than five minutes to learn how to operate your room. It has to be as simple as possible in terms of the mechanism used," Ismail elaborated.
