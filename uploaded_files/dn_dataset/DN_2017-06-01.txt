Moody's raises outlook for Singapore banks to stable
Moody's Investors Service raised Singapore banks' outlook to stable from negative yesterday (May 31), citing stabilizing commodity prices and improving growth conditions.
The ratings agency said deterioration in the asset portion of balance sheets had peaked, particularly among oil and gas exposure.
"Economic growth in Singapore is picking up and growth is also picking up in other parts of Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), so this is positive for the banks," Eugene Tarzimanov, a senior credit officer at Moody's, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Wednesday. "Another factor is we think new NPL (non-performing loan) formation, or the rate that banks get new problematic assets: This rate is decreasing.
So that's a good thing. Banks will get less problematic assets this year and next," he added.
Tarzimanov said bank profitability was also expected to improve "mildly" as net interest margins (NIM) could rise as interest rates increase, in line with monetary tightening in the U.S., and the amount of provisions needed should decrease. (http://www.cnbc.com)

More trains to operate on Kelani Valley line
The number of trains running on the Kelani Valley railway line will be increased from five to eight to meet the increasing demand of passengers travelling daily from Padukka to Colombo Fort.
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said, the government has planned to lay a double track from Padukka to Colombo Fort as well.
Accordingly, a socio-economic survey will be carried out in the surrounding areas of the Kelani valley railway line by an independent organizationUN HABITAT. It will be engaged in the task for at least six months.
We have allocated Rs.1,000 million to build new railway stations as well as purchasing and installing high quality sleepers on this line, the Minister said.
An awareness programme to educate politicians in the area regarding the survey was conducted recently at the Ministry Premises under patronage of Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva.
There have been a large number of unauthorised structures along the Kelani Valley railway line for the past 25 years.
This threatens the lives of train passengers as well as residents of the unauthorised constructions. The former regime and its politicians should be responsible for these unauthorised erections.
Proper decisions have not made in the right time due to the political influences. So, we had to face severe problems as a result of this, he said.
The people of these houses
will evacuate without harming
their livelihoods. They will be provided with new houses or compensation.
A programme will be implemented in collaboration with the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry to distribute houses for these people in a section wise.
It will be positive to bring a very large number of people from Padukka to Colombo after improving the infrastructure facility.

New Bill to protect university standards
A new Bill regarding the protection of standards in universities will be presented to Parliament, said Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella.
"New technology faculties will commence in universities to suit the modern world," he added. The Minister stated these views attending the foundation stone-laying ceremony for a new hostel to be constructed under the 'Sarasavi Medura' hostel project.
There is a great demand for students with technological knowledge; therefore, new technology faculties will be commenced in universities to suit the modern world. Plans have been made to introduce a Faculty of Medicine at the Wayamba University and Sabaragamuwa University, as well as a Faculty of Engineering at the University of Colombo and University of Sri Jayewardenepura.
"This is our government's policy. We have provided autonomy so that universities could produce graduates without any political interference. The reason for foreign universities to flourish is because of this autonomous concept. Each university has its own tradition; the traditions in the University of Colombo are different from the University of Sri Jayewardenepura," he said.
Commenting on the present flood situation in the country, the minister said, the Ministry of Higher Education and Highways has informed provincial directors, officers and district secretaries across the country to assist those in need as well as restore damaged roads.
Private contractors as well have volunteered to help in the removal of sand mounds, felled trees etc.
The hostel project inaugurated by the minister consists of three stages and will be constructed at the Pitipana premises of the University of Colombo hostel complex. Two hostels consisting of four storeys, each will be constructed at a cost of Rs. 488 million.
The hostel complex will comprise 200 rooms providing accommodation for 800 students annually.
the minister added: "our government is constantly involved in the development of universities as well as the accommodation of students. We have increased student grants and will solve hostel related problems by the end of 2018."

The Flood Protection Ordinance No 4 of 1924 is to be repealed and replaced with a new Flood Management Act.
The Ordinance at present allows the minister to declare any area to be a flood prone area and allows the Director General of Irrigation to take proactive measures.
Irrigation and Water Resources Mangement Minister Vijith Wijayamuni Zoysa who proposed the change said the Ordinance was only amended once and there was a need for a new Act to make provisions to protect lives and properties from floods considering the social, economic, environmental and institutional changes that have occurred over the years.
Co-cabinet spokesperson Gayantha Karunathilaka explained that the government in future will take action to relocate all who have built their homes on flood prone areas.

The Government has opened bank accounts to facilitate cash donations to help disaster victims from local and foreign donors to contribute in cash to the recent natural disaster relief activities. Those willing to donate in foreign currencies can remit their donations to one of the following account numbers maintained at Sampath Bank under the SWIFT code: BSAMLKLX

A new frappe range from Barista
Baristas latest initiative is the introduction of an all new frappe range. Frappes have gained immense popularity around the world. It has become a trending beverage that many look for and being an iced drink, it is perfect for the extremely warm weather in Sri Lanka these days, stated Barista, Training and Development Manager, Damith Dalawella in a press release. They now serve three frappes, the Espresso, Caramel and Mocha. The Espresso Frappe is perfect for the coffee fanatic as it is purely based on coffee with an added crunch. Caramel has always been a flavour that is much loved with coffee and the Mocha Frappe is ideal for those who need their dose of chocolate.
Barista, having first established in Colombo in the year 2002, now has twelve outlets and a growing number of coffeeholics patronising their finely brewed Italian coffee. Coupled with delicious food and friendly service, Barista has reached the peaks of the caf scene of Sri Lanka for their innovativeness and new initiatives that keep their patrons coming back for more.
To serve all these and more, to the largest possible number, Barista has spread itself across the island in central and convenient locations in Colombo such as the National Museum outlet near Nelum Pokuna, Laksala outlet at Thummulla, at the World Trade Centre in the heart of the business district and in Bambalapitiya where most of the younger generation hangs out. Outside Colombo, Barista ensures their signature coffee and the best service can be enjoyed at key holiday destinations such as the Peradeniya Gardens in Kandy, at Galle Fort, Ella and Mirissa. The outstation outlets specifically attract many international visitors who look for a familiar brand during their travels. Our skilled baristas are our biggest pride. What makes Barista stand out from other coffee shops is the culture that we create of a home away from home, said Dalawella about their passionate staff and the high quality service that they deliver. Every barista is initially given full-fledged training of two weeks where they are taught of the different blends and coffee varieties.
This includes in-class and on the job training. However, the training does not stop there. The new staff members are rostered together with a senior, called a pal-trainer, for however long it takes, to observe and guide the junior until he or she has truly mastered the fine art of making the perfect cup of coffee.

Out of debt, out of danger
The magnum opus entitled: The Law Relating to Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No. 2 of 1990 as amended (Sanshoditha 1990 Anka 2 Darana Naya Apasu Ayakaragenim (vishesh vidividan) panathata adala neethiya) written by Senior Counsel J. M. Ranjith Perera Attorney-at-Law assisted by H. M. Sisira Kumara Bandara Attorney-at-Law was released recently. This opus is indeed a rare invaluable addition to the legal literature of Sri Lanka.
Though the law relating to the Debt Recovery was introduced to us well over two decades ago apparently it is widely considered that it contains merits and demerits in our law.
It was way back in the year of 1938 that first book of the law in the Sinhalese language emerged entitled: My Lawyer (Mag Neethgnay) written by B. J. Fernando a then Proctor of the Supreme Court of Ceylon. This book ran into several editions; in 1939 the second edition, the third edition in 1950 revised fourth edition was done by his wife Lakshmi Fernando a Proctor of the S.C. with a forward written by Dr Colvin R. de Silva, that eminent Advocate of the day. The book is now unheard and unknown apparently buried in the whirligig of time.
Sinhalese language
However, this was not the first occasion that law was made known to the public in the Sinhalese language. Advocate Herbert Sri Nissanka later Kings Counsel pioneered in releasing a Sinhalese journal entitled: Raja Niti (Raja Neethi) in 1925 where extracts of some of the statutes were translated into the Sinhalese language.
There was phrase coined in the legal area as like Silindhu that in the double murder committed by villager Silindhu aptly based on the Bloomsbury group English novel Beddegama by Leonard Woolf, that well known Colonial Civil Servant, stood at the Defendants dock mum, were unable to understand the happening of the Court of Law where he was unaware of the procedure that he was sentenced to death.
Though the Extraordinary Gazette bearing No. 1/6 dated 07th September 1978 it was allowed the use of English Language to maintain any record and conduct in any court of law in the country.
The books on Sinhalese and Tamil languages have since Sri Lanka was made a Republic it became a sine qua non in our original courts of law.
The reviewer finds a large amount of Sinhalese law books are released day by day. Some of these books are written by Attorneys-at-Law and laymen alike. But how many of these books are written by legal practitioners. This reviewer is of the fervent opinion that most of these books are mere compendiums. How many of these could make an impact towards the legal system of the country
Legal practitioner
J. M. Ranjith Perera a Senior Counsel  a busy eminent practitioner in law ably assisted by H. M. Sisira Kumar Bandara Attorney-at-Law has filled the void that hitherto existed on one of the most abstruse parts of civil law namely the Law Relating to Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) No. 2 of 1990 as amended. His path-breaking opus is not a mere book it is an eminent commentary/ study on the subject.
The reviewer read and re-read this indispensable book, found replete with thirty-six reported and unreported judgements pronounced by the Superior Courts with an easy reference index guide culled with pertinent extracts of the Sinhalese statute and more appropriately from the English statute.
The book spans 191 pages of pure bliss for the legal practitioner.
The books contain the extract from Hansard of the Parliament which the intention of the legislature is found and where there were hue and outcry from the members of the Parliament introducing this statute was a draconian piece of legislation.
Senior Counsel A. M. Ranjith Pereras treatise on Law Relating to Debt Recovery Act No. 2 of 1990 as Amended has trailed the blaze by his maiden book in not only educating the layman, law students and further for the busy legal practitioners, this reviewer advocates that the book would be an essential guide. Undoubtedly this book would serve as a vade mecum for all these wide arrays of readership.

Paris climate deal: EU and China rebuff Trump

Chinese and EU leaders are to agree a joint statement on the Paris climate agreement saying it is "an imperative more important than ever".
A draft of the document, seen by the BBC, stresses the "highest political commitment" to implement the deal.
It will be widely seen as a rebuff to the US, as President Trump prepares to announce yesterday if the US is withdrawing from the accord.
The joint statement will be published today after a summit in Brussels.
For more than a year, Chinese and EU officials have been working behind the scenes to agree a joint statement on climate change and clean energy.
The document highlights the dangers posed by rising temperatures, "as a national security issue and multiplying factor of social and political fragility," while pointing out that the transition to clean energy creates jobs and economic growth.
"The EU and China consider the Paris agreement as an historic achievement further accelerating the irreversible global low greenhouse gas emission and climate resilient development," the draft document says.
"The Paris Agreement is proof that with shared political will and mutual trust, multilateralism can succeed in building fair and effective solutions to the most critical global problems of our time. The EU and China underline their highest political commitment to the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement in all its aspects."
Both sides say they will step up action to and "forge ahead with further policies and measures" to implement their national plans on cutting carbon. Significantly, both the EU and China agree that they will outline their long term low carbon strategies by 2020.
The document outlines other areas of co-operation including on the development and linking of carbon markets. There will also be bilateral work on energy labelling, energy performance standards and the performance standards of buildings.
"The EU and China are joining forces to forge ahead on the implementation of the Paris agreement and accelerate the global transition to clean energy," said EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias Caete.
"No one should be left behind, but the EU and China have decided to move forward."
What was agreed in Paris
Climate change, or global warming, refers to the damaging effect of gases, or emissions, released from industry and agriculture on the atmosphere.
The Paris accord is meant to limit the global rise in temperature attributed to emissions.
Countries agreed to:
Keep global temperatures "well below" the level of 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and "endeavour to limit" them even more, to 1.5C
Limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the same levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between 2050 and 2100
Review each country's contribution to cutting emissions every five years so they scale up to the challenge
Enable rich countries to help poorer nations by providing "climate finance" to adapt to climate change and switch to renewable energy
To date, 147 out of the 197 countries have ratifiedthe accord, including the US, where the accord entered into force last November.
The increased co-operation between the EU and China comes as reports indicate a further cooling in the US towards the Paris accord.
Several sources, quoted by US media, suggest that President Trumpis set to pull out.
This comes after the President failed to find common ground with other global leaders at G7 summit in Taormina, Sicily. In the wake of that meeting, German Chancellor Angela Merkel vented her frustration with the US position.
"The entire discussion about climate was very difficult, if not to say very dissatisfying," she told reporters.
"There are no indications whether the United States will stay in the Paris Agreement or not."
The new move by the EU and China was warmly welcomed by environmental campaigners, rattled by the prospect of the world's second largest emitter of carbon pulling out of the globally supported agreement.
"If US-China climate cooperation gave birth to the Paris Agreement, now it is up to EU and China to defend and enhance it," said Li Shuo, from Greenpeace.
"The pair has the potential to become the new driver for international climate diplomacy."

The first ever recipient of the mega title - former Royal, NCC and Sri Lanka captain RANJAN MADUGALLE says that the Lake House and the Sunday Observer should be complemented for keeping the show going for all these years.
Sponsors are essential to keep the show going. In the past, most of the winners of the top awards came from Colombo and its suburbs, but now, the outstation schools have come in a big way and it is a positive sign for the game. May the show continue for many years to come, says the ICC Chief Match Referee.
Sri Lankas world cup winning captain ARJUNA RANATUNGA, who had won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year twice in 1980 and 1982, said it is the dream of any schoolboy cricketer to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award. Its great to conduct the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Contest since 1979 to encourage the budding schoolboy cricketers. I was particularly happy to see that the Northern Province joining with the others in the competitions at the contest, he said.
I am happy at the improvement of outstation cricket as the game has spread far and wide in the country. Many Sri Lankan cricketing giants of the past and the present are those who have either won the prestigious and coveted Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Award or won other awards at the contest, Ranatunga added.
Former Nalanda captain tuned Sri Lanka cricketer ASANKA GURUSINHA, the winner of the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in 1985, had this to say: When Roshan Mahanama won this award twice in 1983 and 1984, I felt how prestigious it is to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award. It is not an award that everybody could win. One has to perform exceptionally well and be consistent right throughout a season to win that  work really hard to reach the pinnacle of school career.
The Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year show has not only produced top cricketers but some international level umpires such as Kumar Dharmasena who serves in the ICC elite panel Gurusinha said.
The architect of Sri Lankas 1996 victory SANATH JAYASURIYA, who had won Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year  Outstation title in 1988 said that it is hard to express that great feeling. Not only me but also my parents, brother, relatives, coaches and school masters, they all enjoyed that cherished moment. It was a great feeling. All past winners before me, be it the All-island or Outstation, had made their mark in Sri Lanka cricket. So, when I won the title, I felt that I am getting closer to earning a place in the national squad, Jayasuriya said.
ICC Elite Panel umpire, KUMAR DHARMASENA, the winner of the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award in 1989, said that it was one of the greatest moments in his career as a cricketer. Winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title was a big inspiration. That helped and encouraged me to play for Sri Lanka. Winning such a mega award gives a huge image and confidence to a schoolboy cricketer to go places. We were determined to reach the top of the ladder and did so with dedication, the former Sri Lanka all-rounder said.
Former Sri Lanka captain MARVAN ATAPATTU, who won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in the very next year after Dharmasena, said that he considers the mega title he won in 1990 as a certification or a guarantee that he would play for Sri Lanka.
When I had been performing well and scoring constantly for Ananda as a schoolboy cricketer, many considered me as a future Sri Lanka prospect. Although I too had felt that I had a chance, there was no guarantee. All those who had won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title before me had gone on to play for Sri Lanka with distinction. So, when I won the title, I knew that I too could join that select band, he said.
NIROSHAN DICKWELLA, who is currently touring England with the Sri Lanka team for the ICC Champions trophy won the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in 2012. He feels proud to step into the big league though the Mega Show.
It gives me great pleasure to learn that the contest has lasted for nearly four decades. This has produced a bunch of some great cricketers in the All Island and Outstation competitions. Most of the recipients are doing well in their chosen professions may be cricket or otherwise. My best wishes for a successful run of the contest in future. Winning the award was a great encouragement for me, Dickwella said.
The national mobile service provider, Sri Lanka Telecom Mobitel continues to provide that smart connection to the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Contest, which continues to enjoy the longstanding association of the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) and the Sri Lanka Cricket Umpires and Scorers Association under the blessings of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC).

A race to Heaven: Ananda Wedisinghe 1970-2017
Motocross star Ananda Wedisinghe has been laid to rest in his hometown of Kurunegala after losing his life following an accident at last months Nuwara Eliya Road races.
Ive raced with Ananda for many years and I would say he is Fast, fearless and unforgiving on the racetrack. Ananda was the most generous person Ive ever known and his personality completed the image of a motorsport maverick.
The 47-year-old sadly joins many of those from an earlier time who paid the ultimate price for pursuing their motorsport dreams. One glance at Ananda indicated he didnt live an ordinary life, unlike most of us; the big hearted Lankan also made a close connection with fans around the country and definitely was the most popular character in the racing arena.
My two sons were also privileged to race against Ananda, and often told me that he would attack each corner like he was trying to go faster than ever before and battled furiously for every position. Nothing was given away and every chance was taken on gravel as well as road racing circuits.
The downside was he had too many accidents and had many pins and plates attached to his bones and never wanted to give up racing.
Anandas demise would not be easy for us, and I feel so sad about his beloved wife, 4 kids and the 4 grand children he leaves behind as he rides off to heaven.
Enjoy your ride Bro.

SLs demand for real estate in huge upward curve - Krishan Balendra
The demand for real estate is in a huge upward curve in Sri Lanka and this trend is likely to continue, said Executive Director, John Keels Holdings, Krishan Balendra.
Speaking at the Sri Lanka Investment and Business Conclave 2017 organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce yesterday, he said that around a decade ago some 200 apartments were sold in Colombo per annum and this has now increased to around 2,000. We see the demand further increasing.
He said that space in Colombo is being taken for development and people who are living in large areas with gardens are now looking at selling them and moving in apartments. A new apartment living culture is now being created.
This has also resulted in land prices sky rocking and more apartments being built.
He also said that outside Colombo this demand is more on to the beachfront properties and they see a tenfold increase in land prices. Most of the lands are being used for hotel projects.
Chairman Jetwing Hotels, Hiran Cooray, said that today they are witnessing the second birth of the tourism sector after the ending of the war. He said that during bad times the hotel sector was driven by around five or six companies and in contrast today many new players have come in to the industry.
I think Sri Lanka should be better positioned and projected. As and when this happens all the hotel rooms can be filled.
Meanwhile in the earlier session, the new Minister of Foreign Affairs said Ravi Karunanayaka said that several meaningful steps were taken during his time to correct some of the issues in the financial sector and these would help investors to look more positively at Sri Lanka.
He said that since day business registrations, long-term business visas, and land ownership are now in place. He also said that investments to be made in Sri Lanka are steady and they would not be tampered with for at least for another 30 years.
The Minister added that it was because the international community was satisfied with the progress that was made by the government in all sectors that the GSP Plus was re-awarded to Sri Lanka.
Minister Karunanayaka also added that they have not signed any agreements for the Hambantota Port projects. Sri Lanka only has two options . One is to let the Hambantota Port continue as a loss-making venture and pay its losses and debt from the Colombo Port profits. The second is to go in for the Debt to Equity Swap option which China.
He said that the second option is what the government is aiming at.
Minister of Megapolis Development and Western Development Champika Ranawaka said that development is not taking place and investors too are being looked as especially for the Light Rail link. We are also looking at improving the waterways and canals in Colombo and also one from Mattakkuliya to Hanwella has being identified.
The new Deputy Foreign Minister, Eran Wickramaratne, who attended the event as the former Deputy Minister of Public Enterprise Development, said that today there are signs of a reversal of the brain drain.
This is because Sri Lankas can find equal job opportunities in Sri Lanka.
He also said that the government is keen to pursue more private public partnerships and invited companies to explore this possibility. (See page ii)

The SLMC is challenging the Court of Appeal order to register a student of South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) in Malabe as a medical practitioner in terms of section 29(2) of the Medical Ordinance.
When the appeal was taken up before three-judge-bench comprising Justice Sisira de Abrew, Justice Anil Goonaratne and Justice Vijith Malalgoda, the matter was fixed for today and to be heard before a bench presided by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep.
Justice Vijith Malalgoda yesterday declined to sit on the bench to hear the case since he had given an order regarding this matter while functioning as Court of Appeal President .
Through this appeal petition, the SLMC sought an order to set aside the judgment dated January 31 by the Court of Appeal.
The SLMC sought an interim order to stay the operation of the judgment made in the writ application bearing No.CA Writ 187/2016 by Court of Appeal.
Delivering its judgment on the writ petition filed by a MBBS graduate of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM), the Court of Appeal on January 31 held that SAITM is empowered to grant MBBS degrees and further held that he has legal rights to register at the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) as a medical practitioner in accordance with the Medical Ordinance.
Court of Appeal Justice Vijith Malalgoda (President) and Justice S. Thurairajah had observed that the petitioner, a MBBS graduate of SAITM has no obstacle to register at SLMC as a medical practitioner in terms of the section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance.
The Court of Appeal observed that on or around August 30, 2011, the former Higher Education Minister recognised SAITM as a degree awarding institute in terms of section 25 (A) of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978.
The Court of Appeal further observed that the Higher Education Minister has not taken any steps to revoke the concerned decision in terms of the section 27 of the said Act. The SAITM is empowered to grant the MBBS degree, the Court observed. The Court of Appeal observed that the SLMC has no power to take over the functions of the Higher Education Minister and further observed that the SLMC had acted in violation of section 19 of the Medical Ordinance when making regulations relating to SAITM.
The Court further held that the SLMC had acted in violation of the Medical Ordinance without having any power to do so.

Sri Lankan arrested for pretending to blow up plane [Video]

A Sri Lankan national living in the Melbourne suburb of Dandenong was charged with allegedly threatening to blow up a plane.
The man allegedly tried to enter the cockpit while claiming to have a bomb shortly after takeoff on a Malaysian Airlines flight from Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur late last night.
The 25-year-old is facing two charges against the Crimes Aviation Act, but Victoria's Police Commissioner Graham Ashton said they are not treating it as a terrorism incident.
Ashton revealed the man is believed to have checked out of a psychiatric facility in Melbourne earlier yesterday.
Because he was in the facility voluntarily, there was nothing to stop him leaving.
He is expected to face Melbourne Magistrates Court this afternoon.
Malaysia Airlines confirmed the incident on flight MH128, which left Melbourne at 11.11pm before performing a small loop and landing again at 11.47pm.
The passenger was overpowered by the plane's crew and later arrested at Melbourne's airport, Malaysia's Deputy Transport Minister Abdul Aziz Kaprawi told AFP.
"It is not a hijack. One disruptive passenger tried to enter the plane's cockpit," he said.
"The passenger... claimed to have a bomb. But it was not a bomb but a powerbank (battery charger)."
Ashton also defended the long wait passengers endured on the tarmac before police came on board to arrest the man.
"In some of thosecircumstances, if we had an incidentwhere there were further explosives that were triggered, we could havehad a mass casualty incident," he said.
"Therewere 337 passengers on that plane,plus crew, and we could have had avery serious incident.
"That wasavoided through having a properapproach to getting the passengersoff."
Police said the suspected bomb was just a speaker wrapped in plastic.
Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said his staff had reached out to Malaysia Airlines to offer counselling support.
"I want totake this opportunity to thank thecrew and those very brave passengers who actually subdued this person,and indeed thank every singlepassenger for their patience, and you can imagine how traumatic thatwould have been to go through thatexperience," Andrews said.
Andrews said the arrested man had been Australia on a student visa studying to be a chef.
"His history would appear to have mental illness, we do not believe this is terrorist related at the moment," Superintendent Tony Langdon told reporters on the tarmac.
"It's quite heroic for the passengers and crew to restrain this person," Superintendent Langdon added.
Malaysian Airlines said in a statement this afternoon that technical and cabin crew on the flight will not operate until further notice.
Among the passengers who subdued the man was Arif Chaudery, who sprung to action after a female crewmember raised the alarm.
"Families, kids, they were very scared, and some screamingso three or four guys, we jumped as quickly as possible," Chaudery told Today.
"We just put him on the floor and finally staff brought the belt, so we handcuffed him and tied his legs and put his face on the floor.
"We thought he was drunk or on some drugif he's a bum, how did the person get on the flight
"This could be worse, I can tell you that now, but that's 300 people who are safe."
Former Melbourne footballerAndrew Leoncelli told 3AW the man was threatening to "blow the plane up" after being told by flight attendants to return to his seat.
"I was sitting in business class and I could hear this idiot saying he wanted to go in an see the pilot and staff were saying sit back down," Leoncelli said.
"He said 'I'm not going to sit down, I'm going to blow the plane up' (and) an air hostess yelled out for help.
"I approached him, he ran down the side and two lads grabbed him and bashed him  took a giant black thing out of his hand.
"I've never seen anything like it."
Leoncelli said the object seized from the man was the size of a watermelon and had "two wire things coming out of it".
"I think the guy was just an idiot," he said.
"He ran literally down the other end of the plane and got restrained.
"We sat for an hour and 20 minutes waiting for the police to come.
The man has been arrested by Australian authorities, who stormed the plane after it landed at Tullamarine.
Malaysia Airlines said the captain turned the plane back to Melbourne after being alerted by a cabin crew "of a passenger attempting to enter the cockpit".
In air traffic control audio, a male voice can be heard saying: "We have a passenger trying to enter the cockpit."
About three minutes later the same male voice can be heard saying the passenger was "claiming to have an explosive device, tried to enter the cockpit, has been overpowered by passengers".
Passengers started leaving the plane about 1.30am.
All other flights were diverted to Avalon, near Geelong, with Melbourne Airport in lockdown at the time.
Melbourne Airport has now re-opened and is accepting arriving and departing flights on the east-west runway. The north-south runway remains closed
Airport workers are being allowed to return inside.
The incident came just months after Canberra called off the search formissing flight MH370carrying 239 passengers and crew, after a vast underwater hunt off Australia's west coast failed to find the plane.
 MH370 disappeared in March 2014, while anotherpassenger jet, MH17, was shot down in July of the same year while flying over Ukraine in twin tragedies to hit Malaysia's national carrier.

Strauss says more England gain than pain in IPL
London: Andrew Strauss believes letting England stars such as Ben Stokes play in the Indian Premier League is worth any potential injury risk.
All-rounder Stokes, paid a record $2.16 million to take part in this years IPL, was named the tournaments most valuable player after helping Rising Pune Supergiant reach the knockout phase in the cash-rich Twenty20 competition.
He returned to hit a match-winning hundred as England clinched a one-day international series victory over South Africa at Southampton on Saturday.
But he only bowled five overs in two matches against the Proteas and was rested from Mondays seven-wicket defeat at Lords with a knee injury, having already had surgery last year.
Chris Woakes, also recently returned from the IPL, missed both the Southampton and Lords matches because of a thigh muscle problem, although he and Stokes, together with Moeen Ali (groin), are all expected to face Bangladesh in Englands Champions Trophy opener at the Oval on Thursday.
England and Wales Cricket Board director Strauss is well aware of the already packed schedule confronting players who remain solely on international duty, but said what those who appeared in the IPL learnt outweighed the chance of an injury.
That is the slight risk you take when you make people available for a chunk of cricket that is outside the international schedule, he explained.
Injuries are part and parcel of the life generally, but on one hand you weigh up the potential risk and on the other you ask what they can potentially gain from that experience.
Strauss played down concerns about the fitness of Stokes and Woakes by saying: Thankfully I dont think any of those injuries are of massive concern at this stage.
With white-ball cricket an early season priority given England are hosting the Champions Trophy, the ECB changed course this year by letting star men take part in the IPL.
But former England captain Strauss said he would be reluctant to let senior players go to the IPL if it meant they were unavailable for Test duty.
When you get to the stage where youre missing Test matches to play in IPL that sends out a very strong message about where your priorities are -- and I would be uncomfortable with that.
Strauss said trying to balance a players commitments was no simple task in an era of franchise cricket.
Its not an easy one to navigate our way through, he admitted.
I think the players who have gone over (to India this year) and played a number of games have benefited massively from the experience.
(But) weve always got to balance that great opportunity for them with the schedules and workloads and the importance of us peaking for important series as an international team.
England have never won a major one-day international trophy but Strauss, who has put a renewed emphasis on white-ball cricket since taking up his ECB role, was upbeat about their Champions Trophy chances.
Weve match-winners from one to seven, so I think other teams will look at us and think theyre up against dangerous opposition, he said.
But one thing we do know about the Champions Trophy is that theres no margin for error.
You cant afford any bad days, so youre a little bit in the lap of the gods.
Monday saw England collapse to 20 for six at Lords as South Africas pacemen made the most of cloud cover.
But former opening batsman Strauss was happy with the dynamic way England have played the 50-over game under white-ball captain Eoin Morgan since a woeful first-round exit from the 2015 World Cup When youre trying to play a high-tempo, more positive, aggressive style of play, at the back of your mind, you almost have to accept youre going to get it wrong now and again and youre going to have some bad days along the way, he said.

Swaminathan blames Negombo prison officials over escape
Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M. Swaminathan conducted a sudden observation tour of the Negombo Prison on Tuesday to investigate the incident of the escape of four inmates of the Negombo Prison.
The Minister stated that he was surprised at the way the prison officers discharged their duties until the inmates dug a hole in the wall and escaped. He said all officers of the Negombo Prison should accept the responsibility of this incident as it was a lapse on their part.
After the sudden tour of the prison, the minister expressed suspicion whether the prison officers had aided the prisoners to escape.
He called for n immediate report regarding this incident. He said the Commissioner General of prisons should have acted more responsibly, pointing out that he had failed to even visit the Negombo Prison until the minister had gone there himself in the evening to investigate.
He warned that action will be taken to make certain changes in high ranking positions in the Prisons Department and all positions in prisons islandwide.

Taking stock post disaster
The government has acted prudently in cancelling all luxury vehicle imports for ministers, secretaries and government officials for the current year in the wake of the flood disaster. Parliamentarians have also decided to donate one months salary towards relief assistance which though a pittance, given the magnitude of the disaster, is none the less a welcome gesture.
Speaking at an emergency Cabinet session on Tuesday the President opined that top priority should be given at this stage to assist the stricken flood victims to the exclusion of all other matters. It has to be conceded that the import of luxury vehicles for use by ministers had been a sticking sore point with the public all along and such extravagance at a time of natural disasters resulting in a large scale loss of life and destruction to property, needless to say, can only exacerbate the ill feelings. Hence the government's energies should be fully focused in proving succour to the affected victims at this moment of calamity.
The President has also instructed that all officials circulars and red tape be dispensed with in providing relief to the victims while Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne announced that no official will be taken to task for acting out of the box in delivering emergency relief to the victims. Hence it is inexplicable why the personages of the Joint Opposition keep harping on the matter when the Head of State, no less, has given this assurance to the officials unless of course the JO has seized on the natural disaster to fish in troubled waters. JO stalwarts Udaya Gammanpila and Bandula Gunawardena who disappeared from the public eye in the midst of the disaster have suddenly emerged out of the woodworks to proffer gratuitous advise to the government on how to deal with the situation. What is more, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has taken upon himself the task of instructing officials to ignore government circulars in getting about their business, perhaps still entertaining delusions of grandeur while Wimal Weerawansa, true to form, has placed the blame for the floods and landslides squarely at the doorstep of the government. This frivolity at a time of a natural disaster of the worst kind where one in 40 Sri Lankans have been affected.
It is time that all parties shelve their differences and act in concert to assist the unfortunate victims who are crying out for help. In this respect the GMOA has to be commended for coming to the assistance of the government with which it had been at loggerheads over the SAITM issue. A similar response is expected from others too who wield influence. Politics should not be brought to the fore at a time of national calamity. All should join forces in empathy with the stricken victims. It was this spirit that prevailed during the Tsunami catastrophe when, then Opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe joined CBK in a vigil ceremony at the Vihara Maha Devi Park on behalf of those who perished. Though not on the scale of the Tsunami the current disaster has wrought massive destruction to life and property and warrants equal attention by all.
The government has offered compensation on behalf of the dead and the damage to homes and businesses. A sum of Rs. 2.5 million will be granted for each damaged home while Rs. 2 billion will be given for businesses destroyed, by way of a soft loan. However restoring homes alone would not suffice. The government will have to assist the victims in rebuilding their lives. It is not just their homes which had got washed away in the deluge but also lifelong possessions, their livelihoods and much more. To begin with, the government will have to directly involve itself in the whole process of restoring the lives of these unfortunates given the trauma they had undergone. The issue of schooling of the children displaced must also seriously engage the attention of the authorities lest social problems emerge when the flood waters recede.
Be that as it may, contingency plans should at least now be put in place to mitigate flood disasters. Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne wants prevailing laws amended to draw up such contingency plans for the future. He has also called for a geological survey to be carried out to study the soil types in the landslide prone areas to explore the possibility of a solution. Of course work towards the flood control task would entail monumental funds which the country can ill afford at present. What is needed therefore are measures to mitigate the damage during floods and earth slips. Tough and unpopular measures will have to be taken and the public educated in this regard. While natures fury could not be fought by man there are things that could be done to minimize death and destruction such as clearing people from landslide prone areas and the eviction of squatters on river banks. A political will too will be needed to implement these measures.

Unilevers Project Arunella works with communities on Sustainable Waste Management
The Arunella Waste Management project spearheaded by Unilever Sri Lankas Ceytea in and around the Kothmala Oya in the surrounding towns of Dayagama, Agarapathana, Gleinline, Holbrook and Nagasena.
A joint initiative of Unilever,the Nuwaraeliya Pradeshiya Sabha, the Agarapathana and Dayagama Police and members of the local community, this marks a watershed moment for community based waste management projects in the country.
The Kothmala Oya has always been one of our key sources of water with over 1,500 families living in the area depending on it. The dumping of waste in and around the river had polluted it,making the water unfit for consumption.
The Arunella Waste Management project was launched in August 2016 with the aim of turning this situation around. With zero waste now being dumped into the Kothmala Oya, over 20,000 people from our communitycan begin using the river water once again, said Vidura Sampath, Assistant Commissioner of Local Government.
The Ceytea factory team started the project with a series of awareness sessions covering all towns in the area with the support of the Nuwaraeliya Pradeshiya Sabha and the Agarapathana Police. Dedicated garbage bins for segregating biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste were distributed to the community. The Nuwaraeliya Pradeshiya Sabha processes biodegradable waste at the Pathana Composting plant with non-biodegradable waste being recycled. Coming in as the law enforcement partner, the Police ensure that the communities abide by their commitment to the project.
Environmental committees comprising of members of the local community were constituted to make the initiative self-sustainable. These teams of volunteers monitor the situation on ground and ensure proper segregation, collection and disposal of waste. Working closely with the Nuwaraeliya Pradeshiya Sabha, the Agarapathana Police and the Unilever Ceytea Factory, they meet once a month to discuss the progress of the project.
At Unilever we seek to grow our business whilst decoupling our environmental footprint from our growth and increasing our positive social impact.
In line with this, we are delighted to work with the Nuwaraeliya Pradeshiya Sabha, the Agarapathana Police and members of the local community on the ongoing Arunella Waste Management initiative, said Carl Cruz, Chairman, Unilever Sri Lanka.
Launched with the aim of supplementing waste management efforts of local civic bodies, we have, together, been able to bring about positive and sustainable change to the towns in the area. The dedication of the people on the ground inspires us and reinforces our commitment to our core purpose of making sustainable living commonplace.

United ranked as Europes most valuable club
London, Wednesday: Manchester United have been rated as Europes most valuable club by a new report into the financial muscle of the continents top teams.
The report by professional services firm KPMG looked at the finances of 39 clubs based on their popularity on social media channels, revenues for the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons, and success in European competitions.
The clubs were then ranked by enterprise value, an accounting measure used to assess how much it would cost to buy any given club or company as it includes a businesss total debt, with KPMG using its own formula to reach these valuations.
Despite two relatively disappointing seasons on the pitch between 2014 and 2016, Uniteds value surged clear of Real Madrid and Barcelona last year, becoming the first club to break the three billion euros (2.7 billion, $3.4 billion) mark for enterprise value.
Bayern Munich remain in fourth place, while Manchester City edge past Arsenal to take fifth spot, both with enterprise values of just under 1.7 billion.
Chelsea, Liverpool, Juventus and Spurs fill the next four positions, which means six of the 10 are from the Premier League.
In a statement, KPMGs global head of sports Andrea Sartori said: The aggregate value of Europes leading football clubs suggests that the overall value of football, as an industry, has grown.
While this is partially explained by footballs broadcasting boom, the internationalisation of the clubs commercial operations, their investment into privately owned and modern facilities, and overall more sustainable management practices are also key reasons for this growth.
In terms of media rights value, the English Premier League sits comfortably at the top of European leagues, although other major leagues have outlined well-defined strategies to compete for the attention of global fans. AFP

Washed away
Every part of Sri Lanka is at least exposed to one of the natural disasters, be it a flood, landslide, cyclone, Tsunami, and if not to drought. In the recent past, there is a trend of increasing number of flood and landslide disaster events and their severity with the time. In Sri Lanka, the data between 1990 and 2011 indicates this trend particularly after 2003 (DMC 2012).
A number of deaths, causalities, and the damage caused by floods and landslides have sharply been increasing as obvious from the past few years. It is related to not only the increasing frequency and severity of the floods and landslides but also the higher exposure of people and infrastructure to disasters with unplanned human settlements and infrastructure, people living in highly vulnerable areas in a rapid urbanising Sri Lankan context.
Last year, in the same month of May, torrential rain across Sri Lanka, caused floods and landslides which affected half a million people and the death toll was around 100 people with 100 more people went missing. Same scenario of 2016 floods and landslides have repeated again in 2017.
Administrativedistricts
Floods are the most frequent and annually recurrent disaster in Sri Lanka and only a few areas in Sri Lanka can be called entirely flood-free. The highest number of flood events were reported from high rainfall areas; Ratnapura and Kalutara since 1999 (DMC 2012). Most of the floods in Sri Lanka are flash floods and riverine floods. Although there is enough lead time to issue an early warning for evacuation of the population in times of riverine floods, flash floods arrive with little warning and become destructive.
The occurrence of landslides and their reactivation have become a frequent phenomenon in the hill country causing severe damages to life and property. The Hazard Profile of Sri Lanka (DMC 2012) identifies nearly 13,000 km2 (20% area of the country) in ten administrative districts of Sri Lanka are considered to be landslide prone. These districts include Badulla, Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Kandy, Kegalle, Ratnapura, Kalutara, Galle, Matara, and Hambanthota. 19% of Badulla, 10% of Kalutara, 27% of Kandy, 36% of Kegalle, 12% of Matale, 22% of Nuwara Eliya, and 34% of Ratnapura land area are demarcated as hazardous area in the Landslide Hazard Zonation mapping in the central highlands of Sri Lanka (DMC 2012 Hazard profile). The above area is categorised as landslides are most likely to occur, and the higher level of threat to life and property exists, where no new constructions should be permitted.
South-Westmonsoon
Additions to the existing structures may be allowed only after thorough site investigation by the specialists. Records of National Building Research Organization (NBRO) highlights that between 1975 and 2000, Sri Lanka witnessed disastrous landslides almost every year killing over 108 people in 24 fatal landslides. However, landslides in Sri Lanka in the last few years were disastrous, claimed more than 100 lives in one incident.
The deadly landslide hit the Meeriyabedda tea plantation in Haldummulla, Badulla in September 2014, followed by another deadliest landslide in Aranayake in May 2016 ploughed the entire village, killing 100 people and leaving another 100 missing. We are now witnessing the third surge of deadliest landslide since 2014 during South-West monsoon consecutively. Generally, there are three broad approaches to encounter floods and landslides: Prevention, Mitigation, and Preparedness. For the flood protection and flood risk reduction measures, it is either the floods to be prevented from reaching people or people need to be removed from floods. When both options fail, preparedness becomes the only option.
However, flood protection measures in rapidly urbanising countries like Sri Lanka, which are largely structural measures are not simple to get them done than said, because of many factors of sustainability, cost-benefits, and environmental implications need to be duly considered.
Therefore, we need to resort to flood risk management with very high importance to preparedness measures. Are we equipped with enough flood preparedness mechanisms at local authority level Do our people and village based organisations from the areas exposed to floods, have enough resources to respond in such calamities People and community-based organisations are the first respondents to disasters, and they naturally come together leaving differences to take control of the situation, but often the severity of the disaster overwhelm their capacity to effectively manage the situation, hence demanding a timely multi-stakeholder response.
In order to reduce the risk of landslides, proper planning of human settlements, new infrastructure, and other development activities have been sought in the disaster risk reduction plans of the landslide prone areas. Existing guidelines needed to be strictly adhered to, when any development is planned within each landslide hazard zone, supported by the existing landslide hazard zonation maps to start with.
Climate changeand disasters
In the midst of many disaster risk reduction initiatives island-wide, are we still prepared enough to face the enormous challenges created by climate change and disasters Are development plans climate smart and disaster risk-sensitive Has Sri Lanka done sufficient investment to enforce the integration of disaster and climate risks in development activities amidst the boost of multimillion dollar development projects across the island Do we have policy lags for promoting and enforcing risk-sensitive development planning and implementation Can we be satisfied with our national and local policy makers and local authorities in terms of proper risk-sensitive development planning Do our public care about what is happening in their surrounding or what they are doing on their own  that do not lead to disasters and contribute negatively to climate change Public also need to take responsibility for risk-informed development along with the local authorities.
The change cannot be expected only from the national and local policy makers, but we as citizens of this country need to take responsibility and leading role in solving our own problem, rather than just contemplating in the blaming game and finger point everything to authorities. The public can make the authorities work in the right path if due pressure given on the right time, at the right place.
We have much more crises in the pipeline to solve, drought and chronic kidney diseases in addition to completely human-made waste disposal disasters, as recently seen in the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapse. Every year we have many unfortunate stories and current disaster situation is another reminder of Sri Lankan societys tragic loss, without forgetting the losses and remnants due to three decades of war. Let us pray the floods and landslides wash away our differences, not our lives and belongings.
Floods and landslide never see the difference of race, ethnicity, caste, culture, economic status, and colour of people. Time has come to work together, building trust among the communities, and with the state and local authorities, so that a conducive environment exist for multi-stakeholder collaboration to build a safer Sri Lanka.

We need better technology to accurately predict disasters: Minister
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa yesterday admitted that Sri Lanka did not have the technology to predict disasters accurately, especially in the face of climate change.
The Meteorological Department can predict that rains would occur in certain regions, but they cannot give an accurate measure of it, the minister said as he addressed the weekly Cabinet briefing yesterday.
He explained that the government had been working on a programme with the World Bank and the Japanese government to get a Doppler radar system and satellite technology which would give more accurate climate information.
We have started negotiations with Japan to allow us to access one of their satellites which orbits this region and to provide us with satellite technology,he said and stressed that as disasters increase in frequency the government would need to be prepared to spend more money on such technology.
Responding to questions on why the governments early warning system for disasters was not effective, he said,
In Sri Lanka we have a problem with quick reporting and warning of disasters. Even when warned people do not like to leave their homes.
We should at least have a law to force people to come out of their houses in such times,the Minister said.
He also explained that the government had to reach out for basic supplies during the disaster as the Disaster Management Ministry did not have the capacity to stock up on supplies and in the event of emergencies they receive funds from the Treasury to purchase the emergency relief items and such.
Metrological Department Director Sarath Premlal in the meantime explained that even if they were to have the technology, the accurate amount of rainfall could only be predicted once the clouds have formed.
We have numerical weather predictions and model them to predict rains but we cannot tell people that it would cause floods, he said.
Co-Cabinet spokesperson Dayasiri Jayasekara said that while the government had identified the disaster prone areas, the issue was not having a proper evacuation plan for the people to follow.

We will click at the right time - Tharanga
Sri Lanka batsman Upul Tharanga believes there is no better opportunity for his teams youngsters to stand up and show the world what they are about than the ICC Champions Trophy.
Defeat to New Zealand at Edgbaston on Tuesday ended Sri Lankas preparation, though it put up plenty of runs as Tharanga made a century, while Kusal Mendis and Dinesh Chandimal chipped in with 50s.
And with South Africa to come just at The Oval on Saturday, the 32-year-old is confident his side now has the right mentality to show what theyre made of on the global stage.
This is the place and the tournament where everyone has to put their hands up, the whole world is looking, and if you can perform really well in this tournament then you get a huge amount of confidence, he said.
It is exciting, a few of the players have played these tournaments before, but then youve got guys like Kusal Mendis, Niroshan Dickwella, who are playing their first major ICC competition.
This is the place where you can show the world that you can be the best.
We havent done well over the past 18 months, weve had it very up and down, but weve got a very good side. We click at the right time, since weve come to the UK, our confidence is really high.
Sri Lanka comes into the tournament as one of the underdogs, an attitude the 2002 co-winner is looking to thrive on when it takes to the field.
And with four games worth of practice in the country now done and dusted, Tharanga has noticed an improvement match after match, culminating in his own 110 off 104 balls.
He added: These games are about getting confidence and back into form, the batsmen have done really well in this game and the last as well, but the bowlers have had a tough time with the short boundary.
Our fielding has been really good, its good to continue doing those good things really well, maybe we have to be a bit more skilful with the ball in the last ten overs, but overall it has been good.
Before the tournament, getting into form and getting some runs is really important, hopefully I can continue this form into the first game.

Wickramarachchi celebrates 40 years serving nation
The pioneers of Cochlear implants in Sri Lankan J.M. Wickramarachchi and Company celebrated 40 years of selfless service to the nation recently.
The company which has branched out into being the market leader for vision and hearing care services in Sri Lanka, continue to assist those with hearing and vision impairment.
The company hosted a celebration to introduce new possibilities in terms of technological advances available in the field of audio sciences.
The event held at the Wickramarachchi Institute of Speech and Hearing auditorium was graced by President Maithripala Sirisena, as the chief guest.
Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Dr. Rajitha Senaratne and the Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training Mahinda Samarasinghe were also present.
A special tribute to commemorate the services rendered to the nation by the founder of J. M. Wickramarachchi and Company, Mihira Wickramarachchi also took place.
Mihira Wickramarachchi as a single person has contributed immensely towards making a difference in the lives of all those with a handicap in either their visual or hearing capabilities.

The Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to initiate a training programme on auditory science during the celebrations.
The signatories of this agreement were MihiraWickramarachchi and Major General (Retd.) Gamini Hettiarachchi, Chairman of the Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka (VTA).
This partnership will pave the way for the introduction and training of professionals in the field of auditory sciences.
They also established yet another training programme for the public and private sector healthcare professionals on how to help people with hearing impairment and speech problems through speech therapy. It is also in the process of opening a training centre for audiology and speech therapy in Galle.
The company has continuously been involved in research and development, through which, it has been instrumental in introducing new hearing and visionary technology to this country.
They were the first to import microscopes and other advanced equipment from Germany, intended for technological use and were also the first company in Sri Lanka to introduce long-vision optics and the revolutionary German contact lenses.
The WISH Foundation was founded in 2006 by the company to provide funding for people with hearing and speech impairments and a percentage of the organizations profits are allocated towards this foundation.
It has also employed several disabled individuals as a part of its social obligation towards the betterment of the nation.

Womens cricket gets shot in the arm
30 players offered annual contracts:
Sri Lanka Cricket announced the formation of a Womens National Development Squad where 30 hand-picked players were issued contracts.
The players were selected based on their performance at the recently concluded inaugural womens under 23 Provincial tournament by the Womens National Selection Committee headed by former captain  Rasanjali de Alwis.
The squad which consists of talented young women from across the island were issued the contracts by SLC at a simple ceremony attended by the players and their families who were greeted by SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala and vice-president in charge of Domestic Cricket K. Mathivanan. SLC has given new impetus to womens cricket in the past year, with an entire structure being developed for the enhancement and proliferation of womens cricket throughout the island.
The project which is administered by Ms. Apsari Tillakaratne, convenor for womens cricket saw an innovative program being carried out throughout the island over the past 18 months.
We conducted talent search camps throughout the island, where we identified the best players from each of these camps, and then conducted an under 23 District tournament, said Ms Tillakaratne.
This led to the first ever under 23 Provincial tournament, and 68 of the best players from this tournament attended a training camp in Colombo. The national selectors have selected the most promising 30 players from that evaluative camp. These 30 players will train under the Provincial coaches of their particular province under a structured 6 month program, after which they will be evaluated again and the squad whittled down to 20.
Womens cricket in Sri Lanka which had reached an all-time low was given a new lease of life by the Executive Committee, and has seen a national level plan implemented with the intention of giving womens cricketers incentive to engage in a sport they are passionate about.
SLC vice president K. Mathivanan who heads the pillar of Domestic Cricket under SLCs corporate governance structure was justifiably proud of the progress that this particular area of cricket has made and paid tribute to the efforts of Ms. Tillakaratne and her team.
I must commend Apsari and her team for their efforts in getting this programme running. It was not an easy task to travel to 25 districts across the island and convince young women to follow their passion when it presents so many challenges, but this team has managed to do exactly that. I am happy to see the progress we have made in these few short months, the face of womens cricket is changing and the recent school Big-Matches that conceptualised by SLC will prove that both at a domestic level and at international level Sri Lankas womens cricket is going places said Mathivanan.
He further added, These 30 young players were today given an additional boost when SLC signed contracts with them, giving them a sense of security and stability without which they cannot engage in playing cricket, as it is not economically viable to them. Under this contract, SLC will provide each player a monthly allowance of Rs. 12,000/- to assist with their travel, nutrition and sports equipment.

Zverev crashes as Murray, Wawrinka move on
Paris, Tuesday: Alexander Zverev, the man seen as a potential French Open champion, crashed out in the first round Tuesday as world number one Andy Murray and former winner Stan Wawrinka moved through.
Zverev, just 20 and fresh from his sensational Rome Masters demolition of Novak Djokovic, slumped to a 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 defeat to Spain's Fernando Verdasco, 13 years his senior.
"I played absolute shit, that's why I lost," said Zverev bluntly.
"But life goes on, it's not a tragedy. In Rome I played fantastic, I won the tournament. Here I played bad, I lost first round. That's the way it goes."
In a match controversially suspended on Monday at one set each, Zverev was defeated in a fog of mistakes and despondency.
The beanpole German committed 50 unforced errors and drew jeers from the Philippe Chatrier court crowd when he took out his frustration by hammering his racquet into the clay.
Left-handed Verdasco, playing his 14th Roland Garros and 56th consecutive major, had lost to Zverev in the first round on clay in Madrid earlier this year.
But he is an experienced Grand Slam competitor, making the last 16 in Paris on five occasions.
"I practised really hard before this match against a great player like Alexander," said Verdasco who next plays France's Pierre-Hugues Herbert.
"Maybe it was my experience. You have to be ready emotionally and physically because it can be a long match."
Murray, the 2016 runner-up to Djokovic, shrugged off a second set wobble to defeat Russia's Andrey Kuznetsov 6-4, 4-6, 6-2, 6-0. "He goes for his shots, he plays very aggressively and quite close to the baseline. He hits the ball pretty flat," said Murray, who showed few effects of the fever he carried into the event.
Top seed Murray will play Martin Klizan of Slovakia who was accused a faking an injury in his five-set win over French wildcard Laurent Lokoli.
Lokoli was so angry at Klizan's actions on court that he refused to shake hands.
Third seed and 2015 champion Wawrinka was an easy winner, defeating Slovakian qualifier Jozef Kovalik 6-2, 7-6 (8/6), 6-3.
Wawrinka saved two set points in the second set tiebreaker before going on to down the 152nd-ranked qualifier.
Juan Martin del Potro marked his return to the French Open after an absence of five years by defeating Argentine compatriot Guido Pella 6-2, 6-1, 6-4.
"I love to be playing this tournament again after five years," said 2009 US Open champion Del Potro, who reached the quarter-finals in his last appearance in Paris before blowing a two-set lead against Roger Federer.
Japanese eighth seed Kei Nishikori was also a first round winner, beating unranked Thanasi Kokkinakis of Australia 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, 6-4.
In the women's event, Romanian third seed and 2014 runner-up Simona Halep cruised to a 6-2, 6-3 win over Slovakia's Jana Cepelova.
Halep, who had described her chances of playing in Paris as "50-50" due to an ankle ligament injury, will face Germany's Tatjana Maria for a place in the last 32.
Taiwan's Hsieh Su-Wei, the world number 109, stunned seventh seed Johanna Konta 1-6, 7-6 (7/2), 6-4. Konta is the second top 10 woman to lose in the first three days after world number one Angelique Kerber was dumped out in the first round.
"I tried very hard and gave myself a big chance. Every time I tried to run as fast as I can and get the ball back," said Hsieh, who won for the just the second time in seven trips to Roland Garros.
Konta has yet to win one match in the main draw in three attempts.
There were no such problems for fifth-seeded Rome champion Elina Svitolina as the 2015 quarter-finalist defeated Yaroslava Shvedova of Kazakhstan 6-4, 6-3.
Canada's Eugenie Bouchard, a semi-finalist in 2014, shook off a right ankle injury to recover from 0-5 down in the first set to beat Rise Ozaki of Japan 2-6, 6-3, 6-2.

Little Kalu   Cricketing  Craftsman from  Moratuwa
When he got going he was dynamite. Bowlers could not find the right line or length to bowl to him, as with classy footwork and strokes all round the wicket he tore into the bowlers with disdain to accumulate his runs that flowed like the Duninda Falls
That was ROMESH SHANTHA KALUWITHARNE who took to the game when he was knee high to a bat at the school in Moratuwa St.Sebastians College.
He came under the care of high class coaching by Brother Gurusinghe. Bro. Gurusinghe, a cricket fanatic and who had the knack of spotting an uncut cricketing gem when he saw it, quickly spotted the young man and quickly cut and polished it . The outcome was a gem of a wicket keeper/batsman in KALUWITHARNE.
Moratuwa is a town famous for wood craftsmen and pop singers. But KALUWITHARNE was a different kind of craftsman. He was a magnificent craftsman with bat in hand and would cleverly and craftily cut and destroy bowlers with stroke play that was lapped up by those watching with awe and admiration.
Fantastic and promising
After a fantastic and promising career in school scoring heavily in interschool cricket, he walked into the Sri Lanka team as a wicket keeper batsman in 1992 when 'Captain Cool' Arjuna Ranatunga was at the helm of affairs and immediately served notice of the talent that was oozing in him by slamming a magnificent unbeaten 132 with 26 boundaries against Allan Borders Australians at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground in a Test match on debut in 1992.
I was present at that match and watched in amazement the dash and daring of the young man as he walked in like a General and began to heap misery on bowlers of the caliber of Craig McDermott, Mike Whitney, Shane Warne, Greg Mathews and Border. Here he was cutting, driving and lofting in an innings that he will not probably repeat. The spectators and the writer were lucky to enjoy and bask in the sunlight that Kalu dazzled us with.
That Test was nicely poised for Sri Lanka to wrap up a memorable and exciting victory, thanks to this great knock from KALUVITHARNE. But it was inexplicable the ugly manner in which the batting crumbled in the second innings when chasing a comparatively easy target.
Victory written all over
Going into the final day, there was victory written all over it and I wrote my COMMENT column headlined  A game is not won or lost till the final ball is bowled  reminding the cricketers about this axiom. And that the Sri Lanka cricketers just collapsed in a heap to hand the Australians a victory that they were convinced was not going to be theirs was to say the least inexplicable and unacceptable. What was also memorable in that Test was that it was in that game that the famous leg spinning sensation SHANE WARNE launched his phenomenal career.
Another unforgettable knock that KALUWITHARNE produced was in Carisbrook, Dunedin, New Zealand in 1997 when he made 103 against New Zealand. I was there covering that series too for the 'DN' and 'SO' in the company of cheer leader Lionel Navaragodagedera the legend and did not Lionel cheer himself hoarse proudly sporting the Lion Flag urging the little dynamite to keep exploding and bashing the Kiwi bowlers. Seeing this gallant innings from  Little Kalu, coachformer Australian off spinning all rounder Bruce Yardley described it as a gem and that he was fortunate to watch it being played.
To veer away and a little anecdote about Lionel. Exhausted after vociferously cheering KALUWITHARNE, Lionel found a cosy chair for a little rest and unknowingly fell asleep. An alert photographer from a leading newspaper in NZ got a picture of Lionel snoring away and the pic was carried the next morning with the caption Lionel the legend caught napping  This copy was shown to us by our Tea Commissioner in New Zealand Mohammed Iqbal and did not everyone enjoy a hearty laugh. Lionel looked embarrassed worried whether the local papers would repeat that picture.
Dash and daring
KALUWIHARNE was all dash and daring in on-day game. With Black Superman Sanath Jayasuriya he formed a feared opening pair and was at his best in the 1995/96 World Cup when the pair slogged and slaved all bowlers and added a new dimension to the game by going over the top in the first 15 overs and collecting a harvest of runs which paved the way for the winning of the World Cup.
Teams playing in that World Cup were flummoxed and watched helplessly as the pair put on show their heroics.
As a gloveman he was second to none. He had quick reflexes took the snicks that came be it off the pacemen or spinners and batsmen who ventured out of the crease were stranded as KALU whipped off the bails like lightning.
His career was cut short when another legend Kumar Sangakkara began taking centre stage.
KALUWITHARNES career  TESTS 49 RUNS 1933  HIGHEST 132 no  HUNDREDS 3 - FIFTIES 9. ODIs 189  RUNS 3711  HIGHEST 102  HUNDRED 2  FIFTIES 23.

Dazzlers pf the caliber of ' LITTLE KALU' are hard to find. Even rarer are cricketers who though their legendary performances stay in our minds decades later.

Meanwhile, Water Supply and Drainage Board Assistant General Manager S.C Ratnayake told the Daily News that there would be sufficient drinking water supply to the Anuradhapura city and the suburbs, including the sacred city during the Poson season.
He said although water levels are decreasing at Nuwarawewa and Basawakkulama tank, Poson devotees will not face a water shortage.
The water level of the Nuwarawewa tank is 9,200 acre feet out of 36,050 acre feet capacity. The present water level of the Basawakkulama tank is 250 acre feet out of 1,910 acre feet capacity. The water level of Tisawewa is 1,000 acre feet out of 3,500 acre feet capacity. Ratnayake said steps will be taken to get additional Mahaweli water to Nuwarawewa, Tissawewa and Thuruwila tanks to ensure uninterrupted water supply. District Secretary Wanninayake said if the drought continues, it has been planned to implement alternative water supply systems such as construction of 500 tube wells.

Better late than never
Often, the calibre of a government is tested by the manner in which it faces challenges and right now, the government of National Unity is confronted with many. Causing the most concern are the floods and landslides that have led to hundreds of deaths with thousands more displaced.
As the government and its agencies struggle to cope with the ongoing natural disaster, questions have been asked about its preparedness for such an eventuality. While the opposition will attempt to utilise every opportunity that presents itself for political gain, it goes without saying that the government cannot be blamed for natural disasters. However, where it can be found fault with, is in its response to the crisis- especially if it is found wanting.
Even as most ministers and agencies of the government were busy grappling with this issue, another matter was also earning the attention of government authorities: the action of the extremist Buddhist organisation, Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) and its firebrand General Secretary, Venerable Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera.
That Venerable Gnanasara Thera was a rabble-rouser is well known and the BBS had been in an existence since 2004. However, it was during the tenure of the Rajapaksa administration that it first grabbed national headlines. Indeed, although formed in 2004, it was not a very active organisation at the height of the battle against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). It was only after the conclusion of the Eelam war that the BBS and Venerable Gnanasara Thera began their campaign in earnest.
Throughout, the BBSs theme has been that Sinhalese Buddhists are being marginalised. It has focussed its attentions mostly on the Muslim community and Islam although other communities and religions have also been targets from time to time. Neither the BBS nor Venerable Gnanasara Thera seems concerned about the fact that theirs is a racist campaign intent on creating communal disharmony- in fact, they appear to thrive on it.
In 2012, the BBS was creating unrest in the country, carrying out various campaigns against other communities and religions, so much so that it attracted the attention of the then government. As a result, President Mahinda Rajapaksa and government ministers met with the BBS in January 2013. After the meeting, the President issued a statement which urged the BBS and other monks to avoid conflicts with other religious communities. A month later, the BBS also formally met with the United National Party (UNP), which was then in the opposition.
Muslim communities
Despite these meetings, the BBS did not abate its campaigns. In February 2013 the BBS started a campaign against the halal certifying system in the country and the All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama (ACJU) which carried out the certification, leading to the government announcing changes to the process of halal certification. The BBS claimed its first victory.
The BBS next hit national headlines in June 2014. Seizing on an incident at Dharga Town in Aluthgama in the Kalutara district, Venerable Gnanasara Thera made several inflammatory speeches in Aluthgama, Beruwela and Dharga Town, all of which have sizeable Muslim communities.
That led to widespread rioting that left at least four people dead and 80 injured. Hundreds were made homeless following attacks on homes, shops, factories, mosques and a nursery.
An estimated 10,000 people, both Muslims and Sinhalese, were displaced by the riots. The BBS denied any involvement in the riots and was not charged for inciting racial hatred.
At the time, there was the criticism of Rajapaksa and his government for not cracking down on the activities of the BBS and on Venerable Gnanasara Thera in particular. The monk was acting with impunity, making a mockery of the law in staging his protests and campaigns- without any consequences for his actions.
This was the time the country was inching towards a presidential election. No doubt Rajapaksa was aware of the potential political consequences of such a course of action. Never being popular among the minority communities in the country, Rajapaksa relied heavily on the Sinhala Buddhist vote as his political base, a tactic that served him well in the 2010 presidential election.
Therefore he did not wish to be seen as being harsh on the BBS, an organisation that claimed to save Sinhalese and Buddhists. In hindsight though, it was a costly error in political strategy. In the absence of a government crackdown, the BBS stepped up its rhetoric against the minorities which completely alienated them from Rajapaksa.
The results of the 2015 presidential election show that, outside of the North and East, Rajapaksa did firmly well in other areas. However, the swing against him in the North and East was so massive that it completely offset the victories in the rest of the country and handed President Sirisena a comfortable victory by almost a half a million votes.
Since the advent of the National Unity government, it has not been all plain sailing for the BBS and Venerable Gnanasara Thera. The monk has been charged, produced in court and remanded. In May 2015, he was arrested for defying a court order and staging a protest but was released on bail shortly afterwards.
In January 2016, the Homagama Magistrate ordered Police to arrest and produce Venerable Gnanasara Thera before the court. The Magistrate issued the order against the monk on three charges, including obstruction of court proceedings after he defamed the court by allegedly threatening Sandhya Ekneligoda, the wife of missing journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda, whose case was being heard in the court. Venerable Gnanasara Thera was arrested and remanded but that led to more demonstrations and protests outside the court.
Racially inflammatory statements
More recently, in April and May this year, the BBS has again stepped up its campaign against minorities, leading to a spate of attacks, mostly on the Muslim community and mosques by the BBS and its followers. In parallel, Venerable Gnanasara Thera has been making racially inflammatory statements.
Last week, the courts issued an arrest warrant on Venerable Gnanasara Thera. The Thera has now gone into hiding and the government has announced that several Police teams are on a manhunt for him. That has however not deterred Venerable Gnanasara Thera from speaking out. Providing a newspaper interview purportedly from his hideout, he claimed that his life was under threat and that there was a plan to assassinate him after his arrest. He went on to make more inflammatory statements in the interview, mostly against Islam and the Muslim community.
While there is general agreement within the government that Venerable Gnanasara Thera must face the consequences of his actions and that the BBS must be subjected to the rule of law, ministers are also very aware of the politically sensitive nature of the issue. If the matter is mishandled- or indeed, perceived by the public to be mishandled - it could face a backlash from the majority community. That would only play into the hands of the opposition which is hell bent on courting the majority community on a nationalist agenda anyway.
On the other hand, to ignore the BBS and the antics of Venerable Gnanasara Thera would only aid and abet the creation of more racial tension and disharmony in the country. Indeed, if Sri Lanka is perceived to be a country that is anti-Islam, it could even potentially be a breeding ground for Islamic terrorism, which the country has been spared of thus far.
The government is conscious of the sensitivity of all this but is at the same time determined that it should not create conditions that encourage unrest in a particular community, as it happened with disaffected Tamil youth forty years ago. Therefore it has decided that the BBS and Venerable Gnanasara Thera should be dealt with according to the letter of the law- and is bracing itself for the consequences should the monk be arrested.
It is the correct course of action- and it is a pity that such action was not taken years ago when this matter could have been nipped in the bud and the BBS would not have grown into the enfant terrible it is today.

CEB to act when flood water recedes
Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) maintenance teams are readied to spring into action and restore electricity supplies to affected households and institutions the moment flood waters recede, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
The minister made this observation at a conference at the Matara Electricity Grid Station and Consumer Service Centre on Tuesday.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said: "CEB employees have worked as a team to restore electricity supplies to affected consumers. I am thankful to everyone of them for their devotion to duty during this national emergency."
The minister said nearly 625,000 consumers lost electricity supplies due to disconnections carried out for security reasons during recent landslide, flood and gale conditions.
This had reduced to 177,775 because the rest have been restored with the return of normalcy in certain areas, he said.
This meant that only 28.4 percent of the people who faced the disaster situation were now without supplies.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said a large number of CEB offices in the Matara, Ratnapura and Galle districts were submerged by flood waters. The worst affected were those in the Matara district. He said maintenance teams had been strengthened by posting workers from unaffected areas to the affected areas.
The minister said the CEB had announced a relief package to disaster affected consumers. If electricity lines and metres had been broken, they would be replaced free of charge. Consumers had been given a grace period of six months to settle arrears of electricity bills for May and June in installments.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said when people whose house were fully destroyed are re-settled, they would be provided with electricity connections free of charge and exempted from paying arrears of electricity bills. Owners of small scale business and industrial ventures would be given six months to pay arrears of electricity bills in installments. He said distressed people can contact telephone number 011-3030303 to get their electricity needs attended.

Citizens' Mail
Hats off to Parliamentarians!
It is heartening indeed to be informed that the Cabinet of Ministers has decided to CEASE further vehicle imports for their use till the end of 2017. At long last, our servants have realised the folly of spending our money on their luxurious lifestyle. We fervently hope that these elected servants of ours will be further prompted by their conscience to cut down on their ostentatious lifestyle. To spend Rs 140 million to redecorate/ partition rooms of a ministry, Rs 5 million to renovate a Governor's residence, Rs 70 million on a car for a ministry, were the most recent requirements, but fortunately, sanity has prevailed and this allocation of precious money belonging to the people, has been cancelled or temporarily terminated Better late than never!
We will admire them if they will continue this trend of thinking and action. Will they have the sacrificial nature to curb their greed that has no boundaries Can they ever live up to the statesmen like ministers of some 50 years ago
John F Kennedy's famous phrase "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country" is very relevant in this situation.
It is quite clear that in Sri Lanka it is those in power that have to be disciplined at present to be examples to the general public.

The Finance Minister will introduce a common policy on purchasing vehicles for ministries and ministers in the next Budget, State Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickremaratne said.
Addressing a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday, Wickremaratne said the Finance Minister will come up with this policy after discussions with the President and the Prime Minister.
Purchasing vehicles must be based on the requirements of each ministry. It should not depend on the Minister who holds the portfolio. At a time we are facing a disaster, we need to identify our priorities. I hope the new Finance Minister will do so, he replied.
He said the Ministry Secretaries should be permanent in their positions and should be bound to carry on the Government policy despite who comes to power.
We, politicians, take political decisions, but the public officials must take operational decisions. The bureaucracy needs to be efficient and knowledgeable, he said.

Coyle salutes PM and government on re-gaining GSP Plus
The Chamber of Young Lankan Entrepreneurs (COYLE) expressed their appreciation on the re-implementation of GSP Plus by the EU this year stating that it presents both opportunities and challenges for Sri Lankan exporters.
Chairman of COYLE Kushan Kodituwakku said, COYLE hopes to take full advantage of the untiring efforts of the Prime Minister and the Government in the pursuit of this facility to encourage its members to stamp a global footprint on its businesses. COYLE believes in the abilities of its members and in a spirit of brotherhood, envisions in fulfilling the Governments 2020 economic vision by targeting 100 of its member companies to eventually grow into global billion dollar companies.
GSP Plus rules shall facilitate Sri Lankas access to the EU market, speeding up industrialisation, creation of jobs, improvement of income and contribution to economic growth.
Besides the advantages of regaining GSP Plus, it will definitely create new avenues for out-of-the-box thinking and require businesses to have long-term vision and business strategy to take maximum advantage of this facility. It would also be imperative that it be done in a sustainable manner with emphasis on quality and compliance with the EUs requirements and standards on a number of products, he added.
COYLE which has and always will be a forerunner in business and economic development has taken serious note in promoting its members to fully understand and exploit the opportunities offered by the EU-GSP Plus and will in a spirit of brotherhood continue to provide businesses throughout the country with information on the EUs regulations applied to developing countries, including Sri Lanka.

Current exports can be increased by Euro 2 bn - Dr Harsha
The National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) which is the only private sector Chamber exclusively serving Sri Lankan Exporters, has identified the importance of dissemination of information related to GSP+ concessions to the Sri Lankan Exporter community to make best use of the concessions.
Accordingly a Forum to disseminate information on the benefits of regaining the GSP+ facility was conducted by the Chamber on the 22nd of May 2017 in Colombo, following the confirmation of the regaining of the GSP+ concessions by Sri Lanka.Over 200 member exporters of the Chamber, non-members, as well as service providers to exporters participated at the Forum.
Dr Harsha De Silva, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Paul Godfrey, Counselor /Head of Political, Trade and Communications Section of EU delegation, Sonali Wijerathne, Director General of the Department of Commerce, Jeewani Siriwardane, Director General of the Export Development Board and Suresh Perera, Principal of KPMG were present on invitation and led the discussions. They were assisted by Ramal Jasinghe, the President of the NCE and by Shiham Marikar, Secretary General of the Chamber.
Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva, outlined the success of the Government in regaining the GSP+ facility due to its own efforts related to the improvement of human rights and labor rights etc. and the right to obtain information made as an election promise, and not due to pressure from the EU or any other external agency as perceived by some.
He also stated that the current exports of 2.3 bn Euro can be increased by a further 2 bn Euro by the end of this year with proper effort. His address also highlighted the importance of Sri Lankan Diplomatic Missions focusing on Commercial Diplomacyand stressed that Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have been given to related staff in missions to perform, and also that training on market intelligence has been provided to Heads of Missions and Commercial Counsellors to derive optimum benefits from the concessions.
Paul Godfrey in his overview related to the concessions, mentioned that assuming Sri Lanka will reach upper middle income country status by the end of this year, Sri Lanka will have till the end of 2021 (including the grace period of one year) to benefit from the GSP+ facility, and that around 6,000 product lines will benefit under GSP+ with zero import duty.
He also mentioned that the government should ensure export friendly policies to exporters to reap the benefits, and also stressed on the demand for high quality products to meet EU standards, and particularly the demand for organic products.
Sonali Wijerathne Director General of the Department of Commerce which was the focal point organization in the process of regaining GSP+ concessions by Sri Lanka, made a detailed presentation on the GSP+ application process up to the approval of the GSP+ concessions.
The presentation covered valuable technical information related to the GSP+ concessions, particularly in regard to the Value Addition criteria and Cumulation of Country of Origin Processes for the eligibility of products to enjoy the benefits.
Jeewani Siriwaardane Director General of the EDB briefly outlined EDB assistance to exporters covering exports to EU countries with cost sharing up to Rs.2 mn per company for product diversification, and up to Rs. 500,000 per company for market development activities on reimbursement basis, to encourage and support the exporters.
Suresh Perera Principal of the KPMG, stated that current Government Policy does not provide for tax holidays, but provides accelerated depreciation on expenditure related to machinery and equipment etc. as investment incentives. He also highlighted the 300% tax incentive on expenditure incurred for Brand Development and Brand Promotion which will aid in developing products for export to the EU. He suggested provision of tax incentives to promote quality improvement of products and services to enter EU markets to make better use of GSP+ concessions.
A panel discussion and Q&A session following the presentations, moderated by. Shiham Marikar, Secretary General and CEO of the NCE, enabled clarifications of queries by participants.

Dambulla cave temple and Galle Fort are at a risk of losing the World Heritage Site status: Akila Viraj Kariyawasam

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said UNESCO has recently warned that Dambulla cave temple and Galle Fort would have to be removed from the World Heritage Site list considering the deterioration of their conditions.
The Minister made this revelation while addressing a press conference at Sirikotha today.
The negligence of Archeological Department has contributed to this state of affairs. It has not taken adequate measures to conserve them during the previous reign. Now we have taken urgent measures to improve their conditions and conserve them. We have also sought the help of international experts in this regard, the Minister said.
Minister Kariyawasam further said that law has not been implemented by the previous government for the illegal settlements in these heritage sites. And Department has failed to identify the archeological sites and mark their boundaries in the East after the war ended.
Now the law is strictly implementing and illegal settlements are not allowed in reservation areas the Minister added.

Drug probe doctor altered athlete medical records
The doctor at the centre of the Nike Oregon Project (NOP) drugs investigation altered athletes medical records before handing them to anti-doping authorities, according to new disclosures.
Dr Jeffrey Brown, along with controversial NOP coach Alberto Salazar, has been under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada), since the BBCs Panorama programme and ProPublica alleged doping and unethical practice at NOP in 2015.
The elite endurance camp is funded by Nike and led by Salazar, who has coached Britains double Olympic champion Mo Farah since 2011.
Both Salazar and Dr Brown strongly deny any wrongdoing.
In February this year, an interim report by Usada investigators into the NOP claims was leaked by the Russian hacking group Fancy Bears. Details of various alleged anti-doping rule breaches outlined in the report were published by the Sunday Times, the BBC and the New York Times.
Usada has yet to formally charge anyone in relation to its investigation.
Now, new disclosures seen by the BBC and ProPublica further implicate Dr Brown, a Texas-based endocrinologist who has treated many of Salazars athletes and has been previously accused of prescribing thyroid medication (which is not banned under World Anti-Doping Agency rules) to athletes to boost performance. Dr Brown denies this.
Dr Brown, who is Salazars personal physician, handed to Usada the medical records of certain athletes, including Steve Magness, then also Salazars assistant coach.
But Magness, a central contributor to the BBC/ProPublica investigation in 2015, says his medical notes have been altered by Dr Brown.
He says he asked for a copy of his notes to be provided to him in August 2015, before he signed a release form to allow Usada to recover them from his former physician.
One note shows details of an infusion of a controversial but legal supplement L-carnitine carried out by Dr Brown in his office in Texas, on the instructions of Salazar, in 2011.
The note on the left is, according to Magness, his copy of the note of the infusion, a medical procedure that involved Dr Brown putting him on a drip for more than four hours. In the same note later provided by Dr Browns office to Usada, on the right, and seen in the Usada report, various additions appear to have been made.
A number of ticks seem to have been added under EXAM options, including General, Lungs, Thyroid, CV (cardio vascular), and Neuro, suggesting a full health check has been carried out by Dr Brown on Magness.
Magness, who left NOP in 2012 and is now a coach at the University of Houston, says those checks were never done.
He says: I do not recall these being done. I wasnt even in a patient room, but instead in his office during this visit. I do not recall him going through his normal checks of my thyroid or [anything else].
My only speculation is that [those boxes were ticked] to make it look like care for the patient had been given. He might have realised after the fact that when you have a patient, your doctoral duty is to the health of that individual.
And that without the proper checks, it might look like he was prioritising a company, Nike, Salazar, that was paying him over the health of his patient. Dr Brown had been my physician since the age of 16. BBC

Easy NO! Worth it  Absolutely!
As we celebrated 'World No Tobacco Day' (May 31), it is important that we look at the implementation of the WHO-Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) which is included in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that world leaders adopted in September 2015 at the UN General Assembly.
It is recognized as one of the "means of implementation" to reach the overall health goal (SDG3) and a target on non-communicable diseases (NDCs). It is a huge achievement. Governments have agreed to support mechanisms to raise awareness and mobilise resources for FCTC implementation. It is also agreed that governments should increase tobacco taxes in order to address the NCDs and tobacco epidemics and mobilize additional resources for development.
Several other achievements have been accompanied by many other commitments on health and development, including a call to set national spending targets for health, education, sanitation and other public services.
However, we have a role and duty to ensure that governments know that the world community has endorsed the FCTC and its measures, and how effective they can be.
Tobacco control advocates need to play a huge role in awareness raising - Goal3, to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages (3.4) and reduce by one third, premature mortality from NCDs through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being (3a).
The SDGs represent a global consensus on how to achieve a sustainable future for everyone. All countries are expected to be guided by the goals when preparing their plans and policies for the next 15 years.
It is important that the international community including United Nations agencies, the World Bank and regional development banks and public and private donors to assist governments to reach the SDGs
Tobacco use naturally undermines public health and sustainable development in a country. Almost 70 percent of global deaths are caused by non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic lung diseases. These diseases have one major risk factor in common- tobacco use. Over 1 billion people use tobacco today and unless we take action now, tobacco will cause 1 billion deaths worldwide this century and 80 percent of this would occur in low and middle-income countries.
Tobacco use also costs national economies enormously through increased healthcare costs and decreased productivity. It is estimated that over the next 20 years, the economic loss associated with tobacco related disease will be US$12 trillion.
Tobacco use also worsens health disparities and aggravates the problem of poverty since the poorest people spend less on essentials such as food, education and healthcare.
Pricing mechanisms
In this context, there is a clear roadmap for effective, feasible and globally endorsed action. The World Health Organization's WHO - Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) has been recognised in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a critical tool to help achieve well-being for all - at all ages.
The FCTC is one of the only three international conventions explicitly referenced in the SDGs appearing as target 3a - "a means of implementation" for Goal 3.4 on NCDs.
Tobacco control is inexpensive and highly effective. At an average cost of US$.05 per person to implement in low-and middle-income countries, tobacco taxation is the least costly of all tobacco control policies. And tobacco taxation creates more revenue for governments than it costs to implement. Similarly, raising tobacco taxes is the single most effective way to reduce consumption of tobacco products and in turn it diminishes detrimental effects of tobacco use on health and development.
Globally raising the tax on a pack of 20 cigarettes by the equivalent of one dollar would increase average price by 42 percent and results in 81 million fewer deaths. Higher taxes also discourage minors from taking up smoking in the first place.
While increased tobacco taxes boost good health, they can also provide governments with significant additional revenue. It is estimated that a global increase in tobacco tax of the equivalent of one dollar would result in an extra US$141 billion in revenue for governments. The extra revenue generated by tax increases can, in turn, be used to finance other development priorities. In fact, tobacco taxes are a key tool to finance Sustainable Development Goals.
Tobacco control is also a good way to build capacity to deal with other development challenges. As a relatively simple form of tax, involving a small number of taxpayers (tobacco producers and importers), implementing and administering tobacco taxes can help pave the way for taxes on other unhealthy commodities, or for other more complicated forms of tax such as value-added tax (VAT).
Evidence suggests that the availability of single cigarettes poses a potential threat to public health because they may be more affordable and accessible than packs especially to youth and people with fewer resources. As countries implement tobacco-control policies, proven to reduce tobacco use, the availability of single cigarettes could potentially undermine the effectiveness of strong policies.
Although Sri Lanka has fully implemented Article 11 of the FCTC, since 2015, there is no evidence however, that PHWs have contributed significantly to a reduction in the consumption of cigarettes. The impact of PHWs cannot be estimated because concurrently there has been a sharp increase in the tax on tobacco products. Informal evidence suggests that in Sri Lanka very few purchase cigarettes as packets. Therefore, PHWs cannot significantly influence the reduction of smoking cigarettes, where people mostly purchase cigarettes in singles. Single sticks are often displayed, sold and consumed without consumers ever having been exposed to warning labels placed on the pack. As such, people who consume single cigarettes may be less likely to be exposed to graphic warnings. Consequently, the whole purpose of using Pictorial Health Warnings (PHW) in cigarette packets is lost.
Single stick facilitates smoking among regular youth users and may encourage youth non-smokers to experiment with smoking.
On this World No Tobacco Day, we urge the Sri Lanka government to ban single cigarette and mini pack (less than 20 cigarettes) sales as well.
----------------------------------------------

The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control
The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) is the first treaty negotiated under the auspices of the World Health Organization. The WHO FCTC is an evidence-based treaty that reaffirms the right of all people to the highest standard of health. The WHO FCTC represents a paradigm shift in developing a regulatory strategy to address addictive substances; in contrast to previous drug control treaties, the WHO FCTC asserts the importance of demand reduction strategies as well as supply issues.
The WHO FCTC opened for signature on June 16 to June 22, 2003 in Geneva, and thereafter at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the Depositary of the treaty, from June 30, 2003 to June 29, 2004. The treaty, which is now closed for signature, has 168 Signatories, including the European Community, which makes it one of the most widely embraced treaties in UN history.
The core demand reduction provisions in the WHO FCTC are contained in articles 6-14:
 Price and tax measures to reduce the demand for tobacco, and
 Non-price measures to reduce the demand for tobacco, namely:
-Protection from exposure to tobacco smoke;
-Regulation of the contents of tobacco products;
-Regulation of tobacco product disclosures;
-Packaging and labelling of tobacco products;
-Education, communication, training and public awareness;
-Tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship; and,
-Demand reduction measures concerning tobacco
dependence and cessation.
The core supply reduction provisions in the WHO FCTC
are contained in articles 15-17:
-Illicit trade in tobacco products;
-Sales to and by minors; and,
-Provision of support for economically viable
alternative activities.

England and Bangladesh aim to banish batting blues in Trophy opener
London: Spectators have long been advised to get to sporting events early and they could miss the key part of Thursdays Champions Trophy opener between England and Bangladesh at the Oval if they arent in on time.
Even in June, early morning cloud cover that aids swing is often a key part of English cricket conditions.
The proof came as recently as Monday when, across London at Lords, England collapsed to 20 for six in five overs -- the worst start in one-day international history -- against the South Africa new-ball duo of Kagiso Rabada and Wayne Parnell.
A green-tinged pitch did not find favour with England captain Eoin Morgan but even on more placid surfaces the issue of how best to bat under grey skies, which can often set in all day in England, as many a cold fan knows, remains.
Bangladesh highlighted the issue in dramatic style by collapsing to 84 all out in reply to Champions Trophy title-holders Indias 324 for seven in their final warm-up match at the Oval on Tuesday.
Defeat by 240 runs was certainly not want Bangladesh wanted any more than England, a much-improved one-day side since the Tigers knocked them out of the 2015 World Cup, wished to see their top order suffer such a spectacular slump against South Africa, even if they were already 2-0 up in the three-match series.
Yet it says something about Englands current white-ball approach that Jonny Bairstow, their only batsman to make a fifty at Lords, may not play at the Oval if all-rounders Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes are fully fit.
I havent seen a team win a global tournament playing defensively, said England coach Trevor Bayliss.
Its always a team that backs itself and plays bold cricket, added the Australian, looking to guide England to their first major ODI title.
From that point of view the message wont change, insisted the former Sri Lanka coach.
Bangladesh collapsed to 22 for six in 7.3 overs against India, not as bad as England on Monday, but concerning all the same.
But Mehedi Hasan, who top-scored for the Tigers with 24, said they still believed they could beat England
Yes. We have done well in our last few matches against England and we are confident, he said.
Bangladesh coach Chandika Hathurusingha tried to minimise the impact of Tuesdays reverse by saying: Obviously it affects the confidence a little bit, but this is a practice game.
Its a big game for us, the first game of the Champions Trophy.
But our preparation was good apart from this game so we are confident anyway, added the former Sri Lanka batsman, with the Tigers having beaten both New Zealand and Ireland in a triangular warm-up event in Dublin this month.
The Champions Trophy opener is set to feature several survivors on both sides from Bangladeshs 2015 World Cup win over England, when a hundred from Mahmudullah and aggressive seam bowling propelled the Tigers to a memorable success at the Adelaide Oval.
Whatever you have done in the past gives you a little bit of confidence, but then you have to start again, said Hathurusinghe.
So whatever we do first against England, we need to start well and thats what we are focusing on. Match time 3.00pm SLT. AFP

Fazil Marija will be missed
Kandy Sports Clubs cup winning fly-half Fazil Marija has retired from international rugby news that will sadden his legion of fans. His record - he played for the country for 14 years, considering that rugby is a rib bruising game it was admirable that he ran in amazing tries for club and country. His last game for Sri Lanka was in the final defeat to Malaysia at this years Asia Division I championship in Malaysia.
Marija was born on 2 December 1985, though he said good bye to national rugby he will be playing for his favorite club Kandy SC for one more season. Fazil as he is popularly known is easily the best rugby sevens and fifteen game player produced by the country in the last several years.
Fazil hails from a famous Malay sporting family, who are rugby crazy. His father Abdul Rasheed Marija played sports for Police. Mother Fareeda Sherifdeen participated in sports at Kandy Good Shepherd Convent. It was she who encouraged Fazil to take up rugby.
His uncles Tuany Amidon played football and rugby for Army and was an All-Ceylon football player and one of the best dribblers in Asia. Kamil Roy Amith played for Kandy S.C., T.M.N. Sherifdeen - Navy SC, Fazils cousins Ibrahim brothers Raja, Roy, Ronnie, Rinnie and Nilifer, Buks brothers Ansar and Amjad all played for Kandy SC, Dev Ananda played for Navy SC, his brother Faizal is with Kandy SC. Except for Tuany Amidon, the others are products of Kingswood College.
Fazil first donned the Sri Lanka rugby jersey in 2003 and has since been an automatic choice for the national team bringing honor and fame to his motherland with his scintillating displays on the rugby field. He is not only an attacking player but also a tireless tackler who makes him a complete ruggerite who can find a place in any Sevens team in the world.
Fazil was rated as the best fly half in the country; he dedicated himself to rugby and spent a lot of time learning the finer points of the game. in the rugby circle he is almost a house hold name, he has been formidable figure from the day he started playing club rugger.
Fazil is a player, leader, creator and altogether a fine example for all the rugby players. He is a ruggerite with plenty of ideas and ambition and certainly a knowledgeable player. Fazils capabilities and his potential cannot be matched by any of the fly halfs today.
He is a play maker and a fine place kicker maybe two different characters but his motivation is one that is success on the field. It is his excellent combination that kept his club Kandy SC flying high. He has already etched his name in the Kandy SC rugby history book as one of their most dedicated players.
A product of Kingswood College, the school which is situated close to his house he has played the game at all age level teams and led the senior team in his last year of school rugby. He was first coached at senior level by former Army SC and Sri Lanka winger G.B. Gunadasa and later by his cousin Ronnie Ibrahim, a master technician. Fazil as a schoolboy was spotted by Kandy SCs godfather Malik Samarawickrema in the match between Kingswood and Royal, and was invited to play in the Clifford Cup knockouts and today he is a legend in the game of rugby.
In 2010, he led Kandy SC to win the triple and was crowned as the most Popular Club ruggerite in the Caltex Sunday Observer competition. He also led the country at the Tri-nation championship in which he did well as a player and captain. He also led the club in 2015 to win the league and knockouts.
Fazil has helped his club in a big way and in the last couple of years, he carried his club single-handedly. This is something not easy in a game of rugby but this simply proves his determination. Fazil has led the Nittawela club from the front, in an exemplary manner. Fazil is a player who is able to breach the defence and executive ploys such as dummy pass, scissor pass, reverse pass. We havent seen a player of his caliber for some time. He is an extraordinary person, with huge talent who reads the game cleverly in making changes on the spot.
Fazil should be thankful to his mother Fareeda she is the one who encouraged him during his school days. The Kandy SC Committee and the fans backed him immensely and he was also supported by that great benefactor Mr. Rugby Malik Samarawickrema. Thanks to Malik, Fazil got the opportunity to play for a New Zealand Club  Northland Rugby Club, where he played five matches in that season.
For Fazil to hang up his boots and watch from a distance will obviously be frustrating. Hes a total legend on and off the pitch, always had time for everyone. Everyone who has played with, coached and watched Fazil play should feel privileged to have been involved with him. Hell be remembered for a lot of good reasons by the national team.

Few parliamentarians willing to donate allowances to flood victims
No parliamentarian, in writing, has expressed their willingness to donate their monthly allowances to flood victims, said Accountant and Finance Director of Parliament K.G.M. Jayashantha yesterday.
He said, if any minister or parliamentarian had the desire to donate their allowance to help the flood victims, he or she would have to inform parliament about it in writing. Kandy District Parliamentarian Lucky Jayawardene has informed the parliament in writing to donate his monthly salary to the flood victims.
Two parliamentarians have so far expressed this desire verbally to parliament. They are S.M. Marikkar and Sirinal de Mel.
A minister and state minister receives a monthly salary of Rs. 65,000. A deputy minister gets a monthly salary of Rs 63,500. Fuel, transport, telephone and office allowances and daily attendance payments of parliamentarians, as well as ministers, deputy ministers and state ministers, are paid by parliament. If any MP or minister desires to donate his or her monthly allowance now, only their June allowance would be deducted.
The Speaker, however, has donated his entire salary of Rs 68,500 and allowance for this purpose.
The UNP, UPFA and the JVP decided to donate the monthly allowance of parliamentarians and ministers towards disaster relief.
Parliamentary staff numbering 1,100 have taken steps to hand over yesterday's noon meals to the Elpitiya Divisional Secretariat for distribution among disaster affected people in their area.

Forty four schoolchildren die, eight missing
Forty four schoolchildren have died and eight are reported missing due to the adverse weather conditions experienced a few days ago, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
The most number of students deaths was reported from the Ratnapura district amounting to 15. As a province the largest number of student deaths was reported from the Sabaragamuwa province amounting to 17. Of the 44 student deaths, six cases were reported from the Matara district while four from the Hambantota district.
However, no students death is reported from the Galle district despite most parts of the district being badly affected by floods. A significant number of students are still at welfare camps.
The Minister said dry rations and items including study materials are collected at every national school countrywide to be handed over to the needy people especially to students.

Gnanasara Thera admitted to hospital
Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera was not present in Court yesterday regarding a Contempt of Court action filed against him over his alleged offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrates Court and the Court was informed that he is currently receiving treatment at a hospital.
President's Counsel Manohara de Silva, appearing on behalf of Gnanasara Thera, tendered a medical certificate to Court, informing that Gnanasara Thera is still being treated at a hospital for an illness.
The Court of Appeal Justice Kumuduni Wickremesinghe observed that the Court wanted the accused to be present in Court on June 12.
This case is to be taken up for argument before two-judge-bench comprising Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena on next hearing date.
At a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal decided to overrule the preliminary objections raised by Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera against the amended charge sheet. Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake had referred this Contempt of Court action to the Court of Appeal since it is vested with powers to inquire such a complaint. At a previous occasion, the Attorney General filed the amended charge sheet comprising four counts, alleging that the accused had committed a punishable offence which comes under Article 105 of the constitution.
At a previous occasion, a charge sheet signed by Court of Appeals President Judge had been served on the accused.
In a surprising turn of events, on January 25, Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over. Later on, Gnanasara Thera was arrested by police on the charges of contempt of courts, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant.
Through this contempt of Court action, the Homagama Magistrate has sought Appeal Courts jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behaviour and utterance of Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court. He further sought Courts jurisdiction to take necessary legal action against Gnanasara Thera if the charges levelled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.
Deputy Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysuriya appeared for the Attorney General.

Just as they did after the floods of 2016, the Israeli people show their solidarity with the people of Sri Lanka in words and deeds.
From as early as 1958 - when the young, emerging State of Israel sent supplies during the Ceylon Floods - and to this day, Israel has continuously demonstrated its longstanding friendship with the Sri Lankan people.
Carrying a letter from the President of Israel Mr. Reuven Rivlin to the President of Sri Lanka Mr. Maithripala Sirisena, expressing Israels sympathy with the people of Sri Lanka, Ambassador of Israel Daniel Carmon said:
Last week, celebrating Israels National Day in Colombo, I stated that Israel is Sri Lankas all-weather friend. Unfortunately, these are storm ridden days. I am proud to be able to provide these supplies to our Sri Lankan friends. I am convinced our partnership will continue to grow when the clouds have cleared.
Ambassador Carmon delivered the supplies and the letter from President Reuven Rivlin to Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake at the Foreign Affairs Ministry.The emergency supplies provided by the Israeli Embassy include strong power generators, drinking water, high power light sources, and other emergency first response supplies. The generators, which were in high demand, were immediately taken to the affected areas which have sustained the worst damage by the floods and landslides in South Sri Lanka.

IN LOVE WITH DESIGNS
Humans are defined more than anything by one goal. And that goal is to give a greater meaning to their lives. Like other animals we also look to the survival of our species. But if that was our sole desire we would all be still living in mud huts. But we aspire to a more refined and magnanimous existence. Otherwise how else could one account for creations of superior craftsmanship Take our Sri Lankan Civilization and for example the Egyptian Civilization, situated in two continents yet sharing similar genius - the Pyramids and Sigiriya. Arch World speaks to Dr. Janaka Wijesundara on adapting to the climate yet being of one mind.
As people change their way of dressing, their way of eating, their way of driving and their living, they are also responding to the climate/ environment which is one of the determinant factors of architecture. The outside conditions with extreme cold or hot may be not conducive for living in certain times of the year, and the architecture responds accordingly. Yet the connection with the outside or nature is maintained simply because people cannot live without connecting with the nature- visually. However people in some countries tend to depend on the artificial lighting and ventilation a lot during certain periods when they get less sun during the day. The interior aspects are given much priority, as living is restricted to a closed and controlled space during those periods. The extra efforts are taken to receive the roof sun light to interiors, said Wijesundara
In Western Countries designing a home that the occupants will fall in love with and creating designs that will interact with the occupants and feel differently morning, afternoon, evening and night is the general idea.
The priority is given for interior arrangements and artificial lighting and inside air control is heavily used. Sometimes the window blinds are needed to be on during the early and very late sunny periods. On the other hand, the house in western societies seems like a more functional commodity as an electric gadget in the market. Since the houses are built as mass housing, people in those countries fall in love with the neighborhood or the street more than their individual houses, stated Wijesundara
Timeless beauty
Whether it is western or eastern, any skillful architect would be able to create a work of timeless beauty. We can enjoy such good works irrespective of the regional, cultural, ethnic, continental boundaries. It is like western or eastern music that can be enjoyed by anyone if done well. Such architecture is created, catering for the human psychological and physical needs employing the aesthetic and spatial organizing principles, pointed out Wijesundara.
At all times in our history there have been certain patterns of architecture
Though the technology, material used and forms have changed through the ages, the essence of architecture is same. When the built and spatial forms cater for the essential needs- both psychological and physical of humans, they become well accepted and that architecture lives forever. That means architecture repeats. Some architecture just pops up, and diminishes after a short period of time. Like some music styles, added Wijesundara.
Concept of sustainability is universally accepted and in each developed civilization or society irrespective of the geographical locations throughout history, it has been practiced as the utmost responsibility of the individuals and communities.
Initially nature and resources were well regarded and consumed by self -limitation of needs. Therefore according to their environmental settings and available resources, the western countries also have practiced the key sustainability concepts so as in Sri Lanka. However with the industrial revolutions, people began to produce and consume more and more natural resources, and gradually they started to disregard nature and started to work against it. The western countries have been the first to be like that. Therefore today sustainability regards only the technical aspects such as energy efficient equipments, public care accessories, building systems, service systems etc and tropical countries also getting used to follow the same. Many other silent aspects of sustainable living such as socio-cultural values, human wellbeing, happiness, psychological comfort, social security, community identity have become much neglected aspects, informed Wijesundara.
Trends
Trends of course differ in various parts of the world.
In North America, average middle income house owners cannot afford their personally designed houses whereas in Sri Lanka, still the majority middle or upper middle income people hire their own architect to design their houses. In some western countries the house has become a commodity that they buy, like one buying a refrigerator or an air conditioning system. The house in our societies is much more than that, and lots of other sentimental and personal values are involved and added, added Wijesundara.
Depending on the type of buildings, today apartment buildings in Sri Lanka are not very different to apartments seen in other western countries.
In general European architecture responds to the existing settings and historical context while maximizing the building densities. One example is that when you consider urban design, colder countries try to place the building so as not to create shadows .However in tropical countries shadow is promoted as a positive factor to get away from the sun, explained Wijesundara.
According to Wijesundara life will definitely change in a few decades.
Acquiring skills
Living will be restricted to extremely tight spaces, people more spend time/live in common areas, streets, plazas (as it happens now in western countries- they come out to eat, recreate, etc), people work and live in the same place, working and living become one (as seen in our ancient societies), travel may not be very much required- even for that the public transit will be used, the remaining nature will be precious and protected strictly. There will not be any ethnic, religious, or social boundaries/separations as seen today, pointed out Wijesundara.
All architects are going through a 7 years of tough training to become a qualified architect.
Therefore it is the responsibility of the architect to understand the deeper needs/aspirations of the people while providing the basic needs and providing functional living spaces. The architects are supposed acquire skills to observe and understand the humans feelings and expectations with regard to their shelters and bring the most appropriate solutions for peoples needs.
In this the spatial forms, textures, materials, light conditions, are appropriately employed with the natural resources and context settings. However in the future the individual identity of cultures will in a way disappear, explained Wijesundara.
For example we feel very calm and serene in temple environments, whereas a feeling of subservience in the kings palaces.
Though the basic components are included in both cases - for example floor, walls, roof, the manipulation of various ingredients, their combinations are quite different. For certain rhythmic compositions of them, varied emotions are generated, said Wijesundara
Sensitivity is very important for architects. And in order to de-stress oneself, Wijesundara feels that the answer is experiencing and enjoying sensitive architecture of others. Experiencing and enjoying the beauty of nature.
At the same time, they should be able to be strict, firm and accurate especially when the architect becomes the leader of the team, in guiding all other professionals involved, managing the construction teams, and specially handling the difficult clients to deliver the job in the correct and appropriate manner. Generally as an architect, I see that the creative part of architecture is always enjoyable - it is contemplation - hence it de-stresses, summed up Wijesundara.

Making a splash!
The process of becoming a champion diver does not happen overnight. It takes a good amount of time and effort. It is a natural progression which starts with learning the basics and then plunges onto the more complicated flips and twists.
Dulanjan Fernando took Sri Lankan diving to the international level when he was adjudged the Champion Diver at the Seventh Singapore National Diving Championships that was held in Singapore in 2016. He won three silver medals in the Group A boys category in the Springboard one-meter and three-meter and Platform events.
He is among the top eight divers at the Asian Championship. The talented youth, a grade 12 student of Royal College, Colombo, won a silver medal and a bronze medal at the South Asian Aquatic Championship last year.
I started off my tryst with water sports by taking up swimming. When I started coming to the pool for swimming lessons I saw some of the other students practicing their diving skills. This enthralled me and I too wanted to try out the sport. So I took to diving when I was in grade four. Since then I havent looked back. It has become a passion as well as a challenge, Dulanjan said.
The sport of diving is fairly simple. It is one of the original extreme sports and gives a great adrenaline rush to anyone who engages in it. If you can swim, like heights and are utterly fearless, then diving might be the sport for you. The main objectives are consistency and trying to score the highest number of points you can per dive. It has traditionally been an individual sport, but both mens and womens synchronised diving was introduced to the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.
Having mastered the skills of swimming and diving, Dulanjan wanted to try his luck at water polo as well. He became involved in water polo when he was in grade nine.
My uncle, Mahinda Liyanage, encouraged me a lot. He is a water polo and aquatic coach. I was a bit scared to take on diving at first because I feared the deep end but he put my fears to rest. He is someone whom I really look up to. He was the Royal College water polo captain and diving captain in 1989. He is also a national swimmer. There is even a trophy titled the Mahinda Liyanage Challenge Trophy, named after him for the under 15 championship in water polo where Royal College plays against S. Thomas College, Dulanjan said adding that he is into gymnastics too. He has started off gymnastics in grade three and this had come in handy when he took up diving.
One of the most important skills in diving is the ability to master your takeoff from the board. A good takeoff will provide you with the height, control, and speed you need to perform your best. Focusing on this can be a great strategy to improve your diving.
Hard work counts a lot. You cannot cool your heels and expect good results. We do not have many facilities like Dryland Training to really pursue this sector. I practice three to four days for two or three hours per week, Dulanjan expressed.
All competitive diving is done from springboards set at 1m and 3m above the surface of the water. The height of the platforms varies according to the diving technique. You get five meters, 7.5 meters and 10 meters high platforms. The divers need to do six dives each from 1m, 3m and platform. You are expected to do nine or ten dives from each at school tournaments.
Queried on what is the toughest out of all the sports he engages in and Dulanjan replies that diving is the most challenging out of the lot.
It is a bit risky to perform and you need to get your somersaults right. There are five different types of somersaults: Forward, Backward, Reverse, Inward and Twisting. The Armstand is used exclusively in platform diving and is a combination of the somersaults and twists. The body can adapt to four positions in the air during a dive: Tuck, Pike, Straight and Free. I started off with the jumps and now I do three and a half somersaults forward. I do the same number backwards as well. I manage two and a half inwards, Dulanjan noted adding that Olympians do four and a half somersaults forward or three and a half somersaults in the pike position.
Dulanjans first national tournament was the National Aquatic Championships in 2013. He won two bronze medals at the event. His first international tournament was the Asian Age Group Championships which was held in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2015. He clinched sixth place from platform at the event. He has also represented Sri Lanka at the Asian Championships in Tokyo, Japan, and the South Asian Aquatic Championships which was held in Sri Lanka.
Recalling his experience at the Singapore National Diving Championships Dulanjan said that there were only around six or seven divers who had qualified for the finals. Around 99 diving participants have taken part in the championships representing nine countries. He noted that taking part in the Asian Championships is memorable for him because he has met many well known divers who have represented their countries at the Olympics and the Commonwealth Games.

A lot of children took up diving but they stopped their lessons half way. I too had the feeling that I would not be able to succeed whenever I took on a new dive. However experience has taught me that this is a lie. These thoughts motivate me now and I put in my best efforts each time I hit the pool. It takes the desire to get better and the willingness to put in that extra effort to improve your skills, he concluded with a smile.

Many countries adopt forceful evacuation when facing natural disasters: Yapa
Many countries have adopted forceful evacuation as a safety measure when facing natural disasters. Sri Lankans are usually not very responsive to warnings issued by the responsible officials. It is high time we bring in new legislation as to fill such gaps, for the safety of our own people. Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said yesterday.
All the deaths caused by this disaster were unfortunate and unnecessary. While we grieve these deaths, we should establish a firm framework regarding evacuation methods followed in a disaster situation. We can compensate any property damage happened in a natural disaster,but, we cannot compensate human lives, Minister Yapa further said.
A Cabinet proposal will soon be presented to bring in new legislation for disaster management, he said. The planned new legislation will be similar to the laws adopted by foreign countries on disaster management, the Minister said.
Minister Yapa said that new legislation will have to include forceful evacuation as a measure to minimize deaths caused by natural disasters.He pointed out the lack of adherence, from the part of the public, to evacuation warnings issued by the government, is a main cause behind the high death toll.
Stern measures will also be taken against illegal constructions, Minister Yapa also said. He also said Sri Lanka should minimise human activities that compromise natural habitats.
We may not be able to stop natural disasters, but we can refrain from activities such as constructing houses on river basins, cultivating on mountains and causing rain water blockages. Minister Yapa pointed out.
If you take the Samasara landslide for example,there were no landslides reported in the area where there are forests.But, a number of landslides were report from the area where there were a number of human activities, Minister Yapa pointed out.
The Minister requested the public to pay more attention to weather reports and warnings as a measure to minimise the damage caused by disaster situations.

Massive Kabul truck bomb kills scores, damages embassies
AFGHANISTAN: Over 100 people were killed and scores more wounded Wednesday as a massive truck bomb ripped through Kabuls diplomatic quarter, shattering the morning rush hour and bringing carnage to the streets of the Afghan capital.
Bodies littered the scene and a towering plume of smoke rose from the area, which houses foreign embassies, after the blast blew out the windows in a number of missions and residences hundreds of metres (yards) from the epicentre.
Witnesses described dozens of cars choking the roads as wounded survivors and panicked schoolgirls sought safety, with men and woman struggling to get through security checkpoints to search for loved ones.
It was not immediately clear what the target was, but the attack underscores spiralling insecurity in Afghanistan, where a military beset by soaring casualties and desertions are struggling to beat back the insurgents.
Over a third of the country is outside government control.
More than an hour after the explosion ambulances were still taking the wounded to hospital, as firefighters struggled to control blazes in several buildings.
Health ministry spokesman Ismael Kawoosi said around 90 people had been wounded in the blast, as well as the nine killed, but he cautioned the toll could rise.
They are still bringing bodies and wounded people to hospitals, he told AFP.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the attack came as the resurgent Taliban are stepping up their annual spring offensive.
The Islamic State group has also claimed responsibility for several recent bombings in the Afghan capital, including a powerful blast targeting an armoured NATO convoy that killed at least eight people and wounded 28 on May 3.
Najib Danish, an interior ministry spokesman, said initial findings showed it had been a truck bomb.
Manpreet Vohra, Indias envoy to Afghanistan, told the Times Now television channel the blast hit around 100 metres as the crow flies from Indias embassy, one of several in the area.
We are all safe, all our staff, all our personnel are safe. However, the blast was very large and nearby buildings including our own building have considerable damage in terms of broken glass and shattered windows and blown doors etc, he said.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted: We strongly condemn the terrorist blast in Kabul. Our thoughts are with the families of the deceased & prayers with the injured. The explosion also shattered windows at the Japanese embassy.
Two Japanese embassy staffers were mildly injured, suffering cuts, a foreign ministry official in Tokyo told AFP.
Pentagon chief Jim Mattis has warned of another tough year for both foreign troops and local forces in Afghanistan.
Afghan troops are backed by US and NATO forces, and the Pentagon has reportedly asked the White House to send thousands more troops to the country to break the deadlocked fight against the Taliban.
US troops in Afghanistan number about 8,400 today, and there are another 5,000 from NATO allies, who also mainly serve in an advisory capacity -- a far cry from the US presence of more than 100,000 six years ago.
The blast was the latest in a long line of attacks in Kabul. The province surrounding the capital had the highest number of casualties in the first three months of 2017 thanks to multiple attacks in the city, with civilians bearing the brunt of the violence.

Mathews unlikely for Sri Lanka's tournament opener

Sri Lanka captainAngelo Mathewsis likely to miss his team's Champions Trophy opener against South Africa on Saturday due to a calf injury. Vice-captain Upul Tharanga is the likeliest candidate to lead the team in Mathews' stead.
Mathews has not played internationals since January because of ahamstring complaint, and had also missed a tri-series in Zimbabwe late last year because of "multiple injuries" in his legs.
"Mathews had complained of stiffness and pain, prompting the team management to conduct radiographic investigations, which revealed a strain on the muscle," an SLC release said. "He will engage in supervised recovery over the next few days but will most likely sit out the first group stage match."
Mathews' absence would be a substantial blow to Sri Lanka, who rely on him to bring balance to the XI - he often delivers 10 overs in ODIs in addition to batting at No. 5.
Mathews had also appeared to be in good batting form, having struck 95 off 106 deliveriesagainst Australiain Sri Lanka's first warm-up encounter. He didn't play the second practice match against New Zealand.

The projects will be completed between 2019 and 2025 and will see the addition of 800 star-class rooms to the island's hotel stock.
These properties strategically located in the heart of key tourist destinations of Kandy, Yala, Kosgoda, Nuwara-Eliya, Colombo and Negombo will allow them to reap the full benefits of the burgeoning growth in tourism in Sri Lanka. We are pleased to be working with a partner of the experience and standing of Melwa Hotels and Resorts to advance our footprint within this dynamic country, Guy Phillips, senior vice president, Development  Asia and Australasia, Hilton said.
