People need accountable leaders for peace
If accountable leaders come forward, then people can live peacefully without any fear, said Jamath-e-Islami Deputy Leader and Country Affairs Officer-in-Charge Asheik M. H. M. Usair.
He was addressing a political guidance conference that was organized by the Jamath-e-Islami Puttalam branch office, collaboratively with Paffrel, the March 12 movement and CaFFE. It had been organized for the upcoming local council election, under the theme Beautiful, Peaceful, and Healthy Puttalam.
The conference was held under the chair of Jamath-e-Islami Puttalam Branch Head Asheik Abdhul Kahhar at the Puttalam Hudha Masjid premises. At the inauguration of the conference, the National Anthem was recited in two languages. Afterwards, a welcome speech was delivered by Suggestion Board member Asheik H. M. Minhaj. Many candidates who are to contest in the upcoming local council election also participated.
A political manifesto which included seven main features, was published during this conference. Asheik M. H. M. Usair presented a copy of this newly-published manifesto to Paffrel Planning Officer Sritharan Sabaanayagam. Subsequently, opinions of the Puttalam Jammiyathul Ulama president, Puttalam Muhiyadheen Jumma Masjid administrative officer, and many local council candidates, were also screened.
While addressing the event, Asheik M. H. M. Usair (Islahi) said, These days, good people live as the majority in the country. If we need the good governance to exist in our motherland, then changing our minds is vital.
Whether the election candidate is a parliamentarian or a provincial councillor or local council member, he is, however, a peoples representative. But now, the roles have reversed and the people have become the representatives of the politicians. This situation should be changed, he said.
Puttalam is a place where Buddhists, Hindhus, Christians, and Muslims live in harmony. Therefore, those who are against extremism and racism, should be selected as leaders, he added.

Thats our  George!
In 1901 Ceylon was firmly in the grip of the British empire. Some might even say - comfortably so. For, unlike over the Palk Straight in India, where the colonial government was dealing with an increasingly violent rejection of their rule, here on the little island, the resistance had all but snuffed itself out. The elite of the country had settled down into a cosy and lucrative co-existence with their masters, while English language and culture dominated the social scene.
So it was when George Percival Henry Keyt was born on the 17th of April 1901. His parents - Henry and Constance were of gentile Dutch Burgher heritage and firmly embedded in the upper crust of Ceylonese society. They lived in Kandy. Like their peers they spoke English at home, professed the Christian faith, embraced Victorian style and sent their children to English missionary schools. When it was time for George to go to school, Trinity College Kandy would have been an obvious choice.
George might not have been alone in being bored and frustrated with school, but at the age of sixteen when he flatly refused to attend; the rebel in him had already sprung. This is not to say that George was uninterested in learning. He would remain a lifelong student. The young Keyt was, in fact, a voracious reader and perhaps recognising the fact, the famous Rev. Fraser allowed him the use of the Trinity College Library long after he ceased to be a student of the school.
By the time he was twenty, his mind was already a vast repository of knowledge and his skill at drawing was beyond doubt. But circumstances would conspire to set his life upon a different course. Living in the neighbourhood of the Malwatte Viharaya, it was inevitable that he would stumble upon the world of Buddhist philosophy and art. The results of that encounter are plain to see right throughout his life. He was captivated by the Buddhist monk and scholar  the Ven. Pinnawela Dhirananda who opened his eyes to the art, literature and history of Sri Lanka. The temple paintings, the countryside, the people, all came to inspire him and leave an indelible mark on his work.
He translated several ancient Sinhala and Pali texts, was published frequently in the Buddhist Annual of Ceylon and wrote extensively on art, customs and Buddhist philosophy. He embraced the Buddhist way of life and was an advocate of the Sinhala Nationalist cause. His talents and his interests could have steered him in any number of directions, but by the time he was 26, it was clear to him and to those around him that painting was his calling in life. And so burst forth the artist who played no small part in dragging Sri Lankan art out of the Middle Ages.
When George Keyts career as a painter was taking off he was not often compared with other local artists, but rather with his great contemporaries - Matisse, Braque, Picasso and sometimes Gauguin. He did in fact employ a range of techniques that were similar, but no more so than these great masters had themselves taken inspiration from Renoir, Van Gough and Cezanne. What he really emulated was their propensity to push the boundaries of art. Throughout the 1930s George was crafting his unique style of cubism into something tangibly Sri Lankan. His subjects were often ordinary local folk. In his compositions youd regularly find his own surroundings. But as works of art, his paintings were admired around the world.
The Nobel Prize winning poet Pablo Neruda was in Sri Lanka as the Consul for his country in 1929/30. He put it most eloquently when he declared - Keyt, I think is the living nucleus of a great painter. Magically though he places his colours, and carefully though he distributes his plastic volumes, Keyts pictures never-the-less produce a dramatic effect particularly in his painting of Sinhalese people. These figures take on a strange expressive grandeur and radiate an aura of intensely profound feelings.
The famous art critic Dr Klaus Fischer said when abstracting more and more from naturalistic form he is following ancient artistic ideas of East and West.; the fact that he applies techniques developed in the West shows him to be a citizen of the modern world.
George Keyt married Gladys Ruth Jansz in 1930. They had two daughters whom he was devoted to, but their marriage didnt last the decade. Pilawela Menike was his second wife. He had two more children with her and withdrew into quiet country life at Sirimalwatte  a rural hillside village off Kandy. Then on a trip to India he met Kusum Narayan. They were married in 1973. This, the third and final marriage was to last the rest of his life. George and Kusum travelled extensively, including a visit to London at long last. They even visited Pilawela Menike at Sirimalwatte where they received a warm welcome.
George however did have another great love affair, one that would last longer than any other. India. Keyts first trip to India was in 1939. Finally, he was face to face with the glorious realm of Hindu mythology he had read so much about. He could see, hear and feel everything that had inspired him from afar. He would return time and time again for varying periods of time to nourish himself on her ethereal energies.
In 1940 he completed his most famous work  the murals at the Gothami Viharaya in Boralla which tell the story of Lord Buddhas life. It is a grand combination of all his learning and skill that cemented his place as one of the true greats of eastern art. Later, in the 1940s he produced his famous translation of the Sanskrit classic - Jayadevas Gita Govinda. The series of line drawings that accompany it are considered to be some of the finest in that discipline.
The chief mover and shaker of the local art scene in the 1940s was the magnificent Lionel Wendt who set about organising the cream of local artists into a school of art that would spur Ceylonese painters into the modern era. Considering his stature as an artist, it was only natural that Keyt would play an integral role in that great gathering that came to be known as the 43 Group. There, he was in the elite company of his brother-in-law Harold Peiris, Justin Deraniyagala, Ivan Peries, George Beling, L.T.P. Manjusri, George Claessen, Aubrey Collette and Richard Gabriel among others.
Most artists paint to live, but George Keyt belonged to the rarer variety of artists who lived to paint. Indeed he continued working right up until his death in 1993. In that time he created a vast body of work which is now in public and private collections all around the world. In their timeless excellence they prove his own point  Good art is always new.
The 25th anniversary of Kala Pola, Sri Lankas celebrated open air street fair presented by The George Keyt Foundation and the John Keells Group, takes place on February 25 along the sidewalks at Ananda Coomaraswamy Mawatha. Free of charge and open to the public, it opens at 8 am and continues until 9 pm.

1958 under fire
The story of the race riots of 1958 is a story of violence, un-reason, jealousy, anger, fear, suspicion, vengeance and many other states of heart and mind which the people of Sri Lanka experienced. Many LankansSinhalese and Tamils lost their lives in the May riots. Many of them lost their kith and kin, properties, their means of livelihood. The worst affected areas were, Colombo, Jaffna, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Baticaloa, Eravur and Kurunegala where the two communities clashed leaving ugly scars.
There is no sense in putting the blame on one ethnic group or the other. A race cannot be blamed for the brutality of a few, but the self-seeking attitude of politicians. Niether there is any sense in trying to find who started it; was it the Sinhalese or the Tamils Answer depends totally on how far back in actions you want to go a never ending and un-rewarding pursuit.
The riots that erupted on May 22, 1958, lasted until June 2, although intermittent disturbances happened even after the pronouncement of emergency on June 1. The estimates of the range of loss of life based on recovered body count exceeded 400. Most of the fatalities, say 80/85 percent were Tamils; some Sinhalese civilians and their possessions were also affected. Sinhalese hooligans attacked those Sinhalese who offered refuge to Tamils as well as in retaliatory harassment by Tamil gangs in Jaffna and Batticaloa. This being the first major race riots since 1915 Sinhala-Muslim clashes in the country, the events of 1958 shattered the trust the groups of people had in one another leading to further dispersion of people. Arson, rape, pillage and murder extended across the country.
The state police was blamed of being complicit or even fanning the clashes in several places. Quite a few Sinhalese did try to look after their Tamil neighbours, often jeopardizing their own lives to protect them in their homes.
Eastern Tamils carried out a few attacks as vengeance. In Eravur, Sinhala and Tamil fishermen fought on the seashore. Tamil mobs set up roadblocks, beating up motorists thought to be Sinhalese. In the Batticaloa district 56 cases of arson and attacks were recorded. In Jaffna district no deaths were reported, but some Sinhalese businessmen had their warehouses burned. A Tamil gang destroyed the Naga Vihara temple, which was rebuilt later.
Communal tension
In a strange distortion of logic, SWRD Bandaranaike, PM tried to explain a situation by substituting the effect for the cause. He said:
An unfortunate situation has arisen resulting in communal tension. Certain incidents in the Batticaloa District where some people lost their lives, including D.A. Seneviratne, a former Mayor of Nuwara Eliya, have resulted in various acts of violence and lawlessness in other areas-for example Polonnaruwa, Dambulla, Galawela, Kuliyapitiya and even Colombo.
The murder of Seneviratne on May 25 was officially affirmed to be the cause of the unrest, although the riots had begun on May 22 with the attack on Polonnaruwa Station and other incidents. No explanation was presented by the Prime Minister for mentioning Seneviratnes name from the large number of people who lost their lives during the riots. The PMs sudden decision on April 9 to abrogate the Banda-Chelva Pact, set the pendulum of reputation swinging back in favour of the Federal Party which appeared in public as the aggrieved party. Chelvanayakam was considered as a victim of the Governments duplicity. It was under this atmosphere that the Vavuniya Conference was organised. Arrangements were made for the transport of supporters from every part of the island.
On May 22, over five hundred thugs and hooligans invaded the Polonnaruwa station, and smashed up the windows of the Batticaloa train in their frantic search for Convention-bound Tamils. Telegraph wires were cutpassengers entraining from Batticaloa were anxious at threats that hooligans was to attack them as they misunderstood that most of the passengers were on their way to the Federal conference at Vavuniya. At Welikande, all the passengers got off the train in fear. Thus a national disaster was averted.
In 1956 election platforms speeches by members of the SLFP and UNP the Sinhalese were told that they had to protect the Sinhalese, their language and their religion from the Tamil enemies. The UNP degraded into a communal Party too; they were planning to play out the SLFP by being more communal the best method of deceiving the Sinhala masses. The party which was going to harm the Tamils most will have the support of the Sinhalese masses.
The Federal Party started the anti-Sri campaign with tar and brush and obliterated the Sinhala Sri. That was complete defiance of law and order.
Colombo city was on fire. The goons set fire to several Tamil shops in the Pettah and a row of stalls in Mariakaday. Looting went on a massive scale in Pettah, Maradana, Wellawatte, Kalutara, Kurunegala, Panadura, Weligama, Badulla, Galle, and Matara.
Law and order
Bandaranaike then invoked the Public Security Ordinance and declared Emergency. Army and Naval Forces were mobilized to restore law and order. An island-wide curfew was imposed, and the situation was brought under control by the disciplined action of security forces. 20,000 Tamils had become homeless refugees - in Colombo. Realizing the danger from the mobs, they were sent away by ships to Trincomalee and Jaffna.
The transformation came on May 28. By then stories of what had supposedly been done to Tamils in the south had reached. As with all rumours which increased during this time, many were totally baseless. What lastly unleashed the anger of the Tamils in Jaffna was the talerepeated in a variety of forms by people-of the fate of the Hindu temple and burning alive its serving clergyman at Panadura. At market squares and street corners the crowds began to assemble. The petty local thugs obviously found in this circumstance a golden occasion for display their authority. They declared, that it was their duty to retaliate what had been done to their kith and kin in the south. The goons in the mob, always on the look-out for chances to display their skills, agreed.
What is lacking is conscientious leadership among both groups of people and statesmanship at the centre of administration. The cost of delaying decisions and surrendering miserably to political convenience when problems, which often flourish on neglect, presume massive proportions. The anti-Tamil riots of 1958 were minor compared with the 1983 pogrom; the reason for this is that the left-wing political parties which at that time led the working class were able to control the destruction. Unfortunately, they, in 1983 did not enjoy leadership among workers.
During the sixties and seventies, the Marxist parties compromised their ideologies by involving in coalition politics with the SLFP, a bourgeois party which supported Sinhala chauvinism. Hanging on to Sari-pota the traditional Left abandoned its policy on national issues. Thus the Communists and the LSSP, which campaigned for parity between the Sinhalese and Tamil languages, later switched to accept the SLFP/UNPs Sinhalese Only. These leanings separated the Tamils from the main left-wing parties compelling them to accept Tamil chauvinism.

Amazon raises monthly Prime price in US
Amazon has raised the price of monthly Prime memberships in the US by $2 to $12.99 (9.40), in a bid to push more people to an annual plan.
The annual cost of Prime, which includes two-day shipping and video streaming, was unchanged at $99.
Amazon said the change does not affect the UK or other countries.
Amazon has focused on boosting Prime subscribers, which its chief financial officer has called its "most important customer base".
Prime subscribers tend to do more shopping with the company. The service is available in 16 countries.
While Amazon has declined to say how many members it has, analysts estimate that it boasts almost 90 million in the US and has rapidly growing international numbers.
Amazon said it has invested in making Prime more valuable to its members, making more items eligible for Prime shipping and increasing the video offerings.
The firm has said its monthly Prime memberships, which first became available in 2016, are a good way to introduce people to the service.
About a quarter of Prime members opt for the monthly service, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimated last year.
The new monthly price went into effect on 19 January for new members. It will phase in on 18 February for existing subscribers.
In addition to the $2 hike to monthly plans, Amazon increased the price of its monthly student plan from $5.49 to $6.49.
The rise may be a sign that companies are becoming more confident that customers can bear higher prices.
Video streaming service Netflix raised prices on its offerings last autumn.
Analysts said they did not expect the change to hurt Amazon. The firm's shares rose briefly on Friday morning before easing back.

ARTISTIC EXPRESSIONS  OF WIMALARATNE
The forthcoming exhibition of paintings by Bartholameuze Wimalaratne done in the past months was held at the Lionel Wendt on January 13 and 14.
Wimalaratne hails from Kalegana a small town in the Galle district. He was educated at PiyatissaMahaVidyalaya and entered the University of Colombo in 1965. After six months he left the University and joined the Peoples Bank and retired as a manager.
His passion for art was displayed in 1973 when he exhibited 30 water colour drawings and sculptures done in wood at the Samudra Art Gallery, Colombo. The success he achieved at this maiden exhibition made him to hold his art cum sculpture exhibition at the Lionel Wendt Art Gallery in 2003, in which he displayed 18 paintings and selected sculptures.
His third and fourth exhibitions followed at the same venue. The fifth exhibition was held with a difference, exclusively with sculptures at the Alliance Francaise de Colombo, Barnes Place. The present exhibition, his sixth consisting of 36 paintings done in oil on canvas has been titled INSIGHT painted in the abstract style. He does not want to be trslistic following the pictorial style of painting his figures, instead he wants to convey his ideas and feelings in a suggestive manner. Hence, one sees coloured patterns but a discerning observer can notice the message he tries to convey.
Wimalaratne captures beauty with his brush and paint imaginatively evolving a distinct personal style over a period of four decades.His sculptures in wood he did earlier Crucifixion, Ecstasy, Disaster, Collapse, Family, Oppression and Self mortification bear testimony to his ability in creating his ideas into art form. Without following a course of art he had created notable exhibits at public buildings. The best example is the mural done in wood 8x16 feet on display at the Head Office of the Peoples Bank Colombo, on the 5th floor. The figures in the mural appear three dimensional harmoniously blending western and eastern art forms done with dexterity to bring out his figures in the form of a panorama.
He is a seeker of social justice. In conveying his ideas based on this theme, he has portrayed mans oppression by the society and nature and his struggle to achieve against all odds. In painting, he has chosen sober colours like green, yellow, white and their shades from the wide spectrum of colours. This gives a soothing effect to the eye of the beholder.
The essence of his artistic expressions show Wimalaratnes effort in mastering his medium of expression, of his deep seated ideas in the form of abstract art. He has evolved as a major artist in Sri Lanka

Hemas Holdings PLCs (AA-(lka)/Stable) acquisition of a controlling stake in Sri Lankas leading school and office stationery manufacturer, Atlas Axillia (Private) Limited, will bolster Hemas defensive operating cash flows, Fitch Ratings said.
Fitch says it believe the acquisition has no immediate impact on Hemas rating because they expect the transaction to be largely funded by cash at hand without a material increase in debt. Fitch views this acquisition as in line with Hemas strategy of using its significant cash balance to expand its core businesses through M&A.
Atlas stationery business broadly fits into Hemas fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) segment, which includes the manufacture and distribution of homecare and personal care products, and contributed to around 38%of Hemas EBITDA in the fiscal year to end March 31,2017.

Sri Lanka smash Kenya by record margin of 311 runs:
Boyagoda makes highest-ever U19 ODI score
CHRISTCHURCH, Tuesday: A dominant batting performance from Sri Lanka, built around a staggering 191 from Hasitha Boyagoda, saw them record the highest U19 ODI score in their history, and the fourth-highest for all teams, to help them crush Kenya by 311 runs, the joint-second biggest winning margin in Under 19 ODI history
It would be remiss to start anywhere else than with Boyagoda, whose innings broke Jakob Bhulas record for the highest score in an Under 19 ODI, made just six days previously against the same opposition.
From a proper cricket point of view, it was as close to a perfect innings as youll see. The pacing was sublime, Boyagoda first taking advantage of the PowerPlay restrictions, racing away to his half-century in just 39 balls, then taking stock in the middle overs, before accelerating towards the end, and the technique too was up there with the best weve seen this tournament; despite the strike-rate, this was no mad dash or slog-fest  indeed, he struck just two sixes  with Boyagoda instead relying on the virtues of timing and placement, his off-side front-foot strokeplay catching the eye in particular.
Support wasnt in short supply either, with all of Sri Lankas top six making at least 29 and striking at above 100. Nishan Madushkas 60 was the next top score, but the most attention-grabbing period came after Boyagoda was dismissed as captain Kamindu Mendis and Nawanidu Fernando added 80 runs in just under six overs. Mendis especially was exceptional, bringing up his fifty from just 21 balls on the last ball of the innings, his knock containing one absolutely enormous six which flew miles over midwicket.
For Kenya, this was a fourth chastening stint in the field in succession. They have been on the receiving end of five centuries, two of them world record innings, two 400-plus scores, a 40-ball 90, and a 21-ball 53. They could have been forgiven for throwing away their wickets in a bid for an early finish and in the face of an impossible target, and it is to their credit that, for the fourth time in a row, they didn't choose to.
There was never any pretence of trying to chase the runs as Kenya chose the deadbat route, but Sri Lanka stuck at their task manfully, eventually dismissing their opposition for 108 after 36 overs of toil, securing victory and passage to the Plate Semi-Final to face Zimbabwe.



Sri Lanka, Australia smash U19 World Cup records
The best figures and the highest individual score in U19 CWC history we're taken yesterday. Here are the key stats from a record-breaking day.
* 8/35 - Lloyd Pope's figures against England, the best-ever in an U19 CWC, surpassing Jason Ralston's 7/15 against Papua New Guinea, remarkably taken in Australia's last game in the tournament just four days ago. They are the second best figures in all U19 ODIs, behind Irfan Pathan's 9/16 against Bangladesh in Lahore in 2003.
* 127 - The second lowest total Australia have successfully defended in an U19 ODI; they successfully defended 122 against New Zealand in the 2000 U19 CWC. It is seventh on the list overall.
* 191 - Hashitha Boyagoda's innings against Kenya, the best in all U19 ODIs, surpassing Jakob Bhula's 180, made just six days ago against the same opposition for New Zealand.
* 30 - Boundaries in Boyagoda's innings (28 fours, two sixes), the most in any U19 ODI innings.
* 252.38 - Kamindu Mendis' strike rate during his unbeaten innings of 53 from 21 balls, the third-highest in an U19 ODI for a score of fifty or more. Top of the list is Rishabh Pant's 24-ball 78 against Nepal during the 2016 U19 CWC.
* 419/4 - Sri Lanka's team score against Kenya, their highest, and the fourth highest in all U19 ODIs.
* 311 - Sri Lanka's margin of victory against Kenya, the joint-second highest of all time, along with Australia's victory over PNG just four days ago. The highest is Australia's 430 run victory over Kenya during the 2002 ICC U19 CWC.
* 10.83 - Jasraj Kundi's economy rate against Sri Lanka, the third-worst in a spell of six or more overs in the U19 CWC. Sachin Bhudia's economy rate of 10.50 puts him seventh on the list.
* 279 - The target chased by West Indies, their second-highest successful chase in an U19 ODI, behind their pursuit of 292 against Sri Lanka in New Zealand in 2010.

Capitol TwinPeaks displays impeccable faade
The under-construction Capitol TwinPeaks is evolving into a design marvel that will prove to be the jewel in the crown of new developments in the area.
Certain design features are special to Capitol TwinPeaks and residents can take pride in discovering some of the design highlights of their future home. The project earns its name from the buildings interlocking cubic silhouette of glass and aluminum faade which makes it an architectural icon. The facade or the outer appearance of the building exudes urban chic at its best. Palmer & Turner from Singapore are the creative minds behind the architecture of Capitol TwinPeaks. This faade showcases a unique design concept whereby each tower has a revolving stack of extruded curtain wall glazing in blue tone. This adds a shade of new dimension to the building outline which highlights its edgy cubic form. This design aesthetic is unique to Capitol TwinPeaks.
The faade also features the sky-lounge at the 50th level to present unobstructed views from the skyline towards the ocean, Beira lake, and city. This is a unique vantage point exclusive for residents and visitors of Capitol TwinPeaks.
While aesthetics take prime importance over the faade, the performance and safety aspects of the faade are also taken care by Sanken, Design & Build construction partner of Capitol Developers. The faade is a composition of aluminium extrusion and glazing material along with other accessories. The full-height windows are a contemporary feature which gives the feel of warmth and allows maximum natural light permeation.
Technically, the faade of TwinPeaks is known to be a unitized pressure equalized system. It means the feature will be bespoke in terms of design, fabrication and installation. Design, production and assembly of the faade will be undertaken off-site under strictly controlled factory environment and later shipped to site for installation. Off-site production allows Sanken to do parallel production of the faade while site is busy with its construction schedule. This will help the construction giant to deliver the project on time, keeping to its good reputation on all past projects. The other main advantage of a unitized faade is the fact that it allows the faade to be produced in a stringent environment (in terms of quality) at the factory. This helps to ensure precession of engineering, zero defects, and perfection over the end product. This next-gen technology ensures the faade of TwinPeaks is made to world class standards. Safety with regard to fire is another important performance measure in the facade. Sanken, in collaboration with think tanks and technical minds, has developed a fool proof design solution to ensure that buildings perimeter fire containment system is fire rated as per fire codes. These systems provide confidence that the materials used for perimeter fire containment remain in place for specific duration of the required rating in the event of a fire.
The faade system is structurally designed to withstand wind pressure and this was ascertained through a wind tunnel test which was done in an accredited lab in Sydney, Australia under the guidance and supervision of Prof. Priyan Mendis (Professor of Civil Engineering at The University of Melbourne & Chairman of Sri Lankas leading Structural design consultancy firm Civil & Structural Engineering Consultants (Pvt) Ltd.). This test along with design studies over the external environment ensures that the faade design has accounted for lateral wind loads, sway effect that could occur in both towers, and of course seismic loads.
Moreover, each and every material component of the TwinPeaks faade is sourced from the best suppliers around the world and most of them are eco-friendly, green, durable, safe, requires less maintenance and 100% recyclable. The design, materials, workmanship of the faade contractor has been put under scrutiny by various testing methods in line with stringent standards. The faade developed for TwinPeaks will be tested in an accredited lab by simulating the harshness of nature, which will include wind, water and turbulence. Upon successful completion and satisfactory results of the tests, only faade system production will commence. This assures that the faade of Capitol TwinPeaks is developed in line with world-class standards with no room for any error. Lighting up this magnum opus  Capitol TwinPeaks adds another dimension to the faade system. Projected cubic curtain walls of the building will light up with strip lighting around the silhouette to make the buildings glow from within at dusk.

China eyes more tax cuts to sustain economic recovery
BEIJING - With the economy on a firm footing and fiscal revenue increasing, China will continue its efforts on tax reduction to lower business costs and sustain the strength of economic recovery, economists said.
Government at all levels may maintain and expand the scheme of cutting taxes and administrative fees this year to support the real economy, said Wang Yuanhong, an economist at the State Information Center, a government think tank. In the latest move, Shaanxi unveiled 30 policies, including lower corporate income tax rates for high-tech firms and exemption of certain administrative charges, to support the real economy for the next two years.
Jiang Zhen, an associate researcher of the National Academy of Economic Strategy, expects this years policies to be more targeted - reducing business costs while addressing problems emerged during economic restructuring. The government should also move to streamline administrative procedures and push forward taxation system reform, Jiang said.China pledged to implement the proactive fiscal policy in 2018. Improving economic momentum and rising fiscal revenue have provided more room for policy makers to maneuver.
The countrys economy expanded 6.9 percent in 2017, with the pace of growth accelerating for the first time since 2011.
Fiscal revenue rose between 7 and 8 percent year-on-year in 2017, exceeding the governments annual target of 5 percent and up from 4.5 percent posted in 2016, according to Ning Jizhe, head of the National Bureau of Statistics.

Cisco unveils strategic initiative to deepen Lankas digital transformation drive
Cisco deepened its commitment in Sri Lanka with the launch of Cisco START- a new initiative specifically designed to help Sri Lankan SMBs build their digital foundation and become globally competitive.
This initiative is a demonstration of Ciscos commitment to accelerate Sri Lankas digital transformation and showcase how digitization can fuel economic growth, world-class innovation, sustainable competitiveness, and prosperity.
A digitized country aims to drive GDP growth, create jobs and foster innovation, enhance research and education, stimulate entrepreneurship, accelerate business innovation, develop economic cluster initiatives, and support infrastructure.
High-speed broadband coverage, rising adoption of mobile devices, proliferation of data, improving quality of connectivity as well as the expansion of logistics services and networks are breaking the geographical market barriers for Sri Lankan businesses and opening up new opportunities.
Cisco recognises that Sri Lankan small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are a critical industry which will accelerate Sri Lanka s digitization and create vast opportunities for economic competitiveness and job creation.
SMBs and midmarket account for almost 52% of Sri Lankas GDP and employ a workforce of over a million people making it one of the most critical high-growth segments in the country. With Sri Lanka looking to drive growth through digitization, SMBs have become an essential component of the countrys digital transformation journey.
However, SMBs face challenges such as access to right technology, lack of skill sets as well as high entry cost that limit their ability to scale and seize opportunities provided by digitization.
Cisco START aims to make it easy for SMBs and midmarket customers to embrace digitization by providing them with access to a suite of simple, secure and smart enterprise-class technologies, specifically tailored to their needs.
As part of Ciscos commitment to accelerate Digital Sri Lanka and support skill development, Cisco Networking Academy is engaged with several leading universities, the government, and Sri Lankas defence establishments.
Sudhir Nayar, Managing Director, Commercial Sales, Cisco India & SAARC said: Sri Lanka is an important market for Cisco. The launch of Cisco START demonstrates our commitment to accelerate digitization of SMBs in Sri Lanka. SMBs play a vital role in driving Sri Lankas growth in this digital world.
He further added Digitization has emerged as the most transformative means to ensure growth and balance the socio-economic divide. It creates economic competitiveness, employment, increases GDP, improves public services, and enhances the quality of life of citizens. In Sri Lanka, we are partnering with leading service providers, banks, healthcare providers, as well the government in their digitization efforts.
He also said that digitalisation also helps to reduce corruption due to its transparency.
Cisco is also streamlining the processes and incentives for its vast partner and distributor network in Sri Lanka. Commenting on the topic, Mukundhan Manimandiran, Director, Cisco said Cisco is a 100% partner-led company, and we have over 100 partners in Sri Lanka. They significantly expand Ciscos customer reach around Sri Lanka and Maldives with innovative solutions and services based on Cisco technology.

Promises kept upright
If keeping the election promises are a hurdle, the incumbent Yahapalana government has achieved that. They have delivered the promises. The executive presidency, though not abolished, is diluted and is not almighty as it used to be. A flyover has been introduced to the bottleneck traffic of Rajagiriya. A reservoir has been given to the public in Moragahakanda. And now it is up to the general public to pay gratitude in the forthcoming election without falling for the false promises of other parties.
Addressing rallies in Elpitiya and Godakawela in support of the UNP candidates contesting the forthcoming local government elections, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that legislation would be in place soon to ensure speedy and equitable justice was delivered, without letting cases drag on for long periods.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is a man of words. And we fervently hope he will keep this promise as well. This is something that should have been done about 15 years back. The previous governments failed to execute this. The Yahapalana government  we keep our fingers crossed  will attend to this significant task without fail.
The politicians are notorious for being concerned only about their duty-free vehicles, luxury pension schemes, luxury houses, high salaries, benefits and allowances. They failed to look into basic problems of the ordinary poor people. We are happy that the Yahapalana government has reversed that trend.
Therefore, the government does not have to depend on direct foreign investment. We have enough capable and clever lawyers to work on this. What is necessary is the will of the politicians and others in power. And that is a certainty we can look forward to with the incumbent government.

CPC steps up raids; another fuel station sealed
The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) issuing a communiqu said that the underground petrol storage tanks and fuel pumps of the fuel station at Gamsabha Junction in Nugegoda had been sealed on Monday night, based on a raid carried out by the CPC investigation team.
The raid was carried out based on complaints made by consumers that Kerosene was being mixed with the petrol and sold to consumers. The CPC said samples of the fuel had been obtained from the particular petrol shed and sent for laboratory testing. Based on the results of the tests the CPC said further action would be initiated.
Meanwhile, the sudden raids team had also intercepted a fuel bowser transporting furnace oil from Kolonnawa to Colombo Galadari hotel and upon testing the fuel samples, determined that the furnace oil was of low quality.
It is suspected that during transportation, the furnace oil may have been mixed with a low grade oil. CPC sources said suspicion had been raised as the relevant bowser had not travelled on the assigned rout and had shown a long stop at a particular location, where it is suspected that the fuel could have been missed. Further investigations are being carried out by the CPC investigations unit.
Meanwhile, Petroleum Minister Arjuna Ranatunge said the number of sudden raids have been stepped up to prevent the misappropriation of fuel and irregularities. In the event there is any suspicion of contaminated or mixed fuel, Minister Ranatunge appealed to the public to call the nearest Police station or dial 0728870624/ 0777748417 and notify the raids team.
Speaking to the Daily News, the Media Secretary to the Petroleum Minister, Thameera Manju said so far petrol stations in Naula, Nawala and Nugegoda had been raided and sealed for storage and distribution of mixed fuel.
In addition to the bowser that was apprehended last week another bowser from the Udugampola area was also seized and their license suspended for having mixed kerosene with petrol which was being transported from Muthurajawela to Kurunegala.Test results had confirmed that the fuel in two of the compartments had been mixed with Kerosene.

The  dancers move
The role of personality in dance is an important factor. In any dance form, whether it is a modern dance form, folk dance form, fusion dance form, a classical dance, or even if it is a ritual dance form to some extent, the personality plays an important role. For dance body and personality are the part and parcel of the art. In any dance form, the body is an instrument.
Make-up enhances the personality of the dancer. Hence maintaining the figure is an important factor for dance. Each dance form has its unique make-up and distinctive costumes. Most of the oriental classical dance forms, folk dance forms and ritual dance forms have their old age links, traditions and historical background and religious affiliations. To enhance the personality of the dancers they should put suitable makeup, despite their natural beautiful features. It is very much needed for the classical dance artists. Any performing artiste, whether it is a dancer, drama artiste, teledrama artiste, or silver screen artiste the personality plays an important role.
Ritual forms
However, for drama artistes, teledrama artistes, or silver screen artists, the selective role and the makeup factor are chosen according to the need and necessity of the character. However, the oriental classical dances, folk dances and ritual dance forms have the selective and distinctive make-up of their own. The folk dance forms and the ritual dance forms belong to Desi dance forms.
That means it is confined to a particular limited Pradesh or area. Yet most of these dance forms do not gain the worldwide recognition.
The folk dances and ritual dances are mostly performed in open air theatres. In these folk and ritual dance forms, the personality of the artists is not considered serious. But on the other hand, any classical dance form, in spite of its distinctive make-up and costumes, has certain basic personal qualities needed for a classical dancer.
The classical dance form is much more polished by numerous factors as well as by sophisticated techniques which have gained worldwide recognition. The basic attraction for these classical dance forms is the dancers personality. Numerous ancient dance scripts still describe and provide the aesthetic values and guidelines to the classical dance forms.
Well defined
Among the instructions given in the ancient scripts the quality and the duties of the teachers and nature and the personality of, the students are well defined. The professional performers are less, as compared to the stage dance performers. Today the students are mostly stage performers. Hence, the stage performers must have a suitable figure for the dance. The type and the nature of the personality of the dance students are given in the ancient dance scripts.
According to the ancient spiritual dance scripts, the dancer must be of fair complexion. The face must be beautiful like a lotus flower. She must not be too fat or too thin. As for the intelligence, the dancer should be very sharp. Further, she should have a thorough knowledge of the theory and the practical side of the dance, mainly about the Thala (rhythm), Kala (speed) and Layla (balancing the Thala and Kala) scales.
The dancer should be very obedient and able to interpret the meaning smoothly through hand gestures and facial expressions. The dancer is supposed to have a good voice and knowledge in the classical vocal music. She must cultivate and inherit such good qualities and habits such as humility. She must be polite and respect God, guru, elders and hermits.
The first appearance of the dancer should be very attractive to the audience like a full moon with brightness. These qualities are given in the ancient dance scripts but today one cannot expect all these qualities and guidelines given in the age-old scripts.
Pancake makeup
Unfortunately, today parents and students are involved in dance, without considering their personalities. To a certain extent, numerous pancake makeup and colour base can improve basic complexion.
However, the size of the figure cannot be changed. It is necessary that whether a dancer or dance teacher must maintain their figure throughout their life. Personality is the part and parcel of the art form.

Does debt pay China and the politics of investment in Sri Lanka
Last month, the Sri Lankan government formally handed over control of the port of Hambantota to Chinese interests on a 99-year lease.
The price was over one billion dollars, but this came mostly in the form of a reduction in the enormous debt burden to Beijing that is crippling the island nation's economy. Strategists warn that by giving up control of the port, a strategic asset straddling Indian Ocean shipping lanes, Sri Lanka is sacrificing its sovereignty and succumbing to what one Indian analyst has labelled creditor imperialism by China.
If China's motives are indeed imperialist, is this form of economic diplomacy effective In a recent article, we explore the sources and impact of Beijing's financial leverage over Colombo. For more than a decade China has been increasing its use of credit abroad-provided on both concessional and non-concessional terms-to facilitate both the international expansion of Chinese industry and the cultivation of influence with recipient governments.
Beijing's signature international initiatives in recent years-the Belt and Road Initiative and its components such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank-are similarly based on the provision of financing, demonstrating that China has the resources to wield significant power and influence on the world stage. Moreover, they create the perception that Beijing is ready and willing to take an active leadership role.
The Sri Lankan case offers an illustrative instance of how the Chinese model of debt-driven infrastructure financing plays out. Needing to jumpstart economic reconstruction following the end of a brutal civil war, Colombo eagerly accepted close to $15 billion in Chinese money between 2005 and 2017, largely to facilitate the construction (by Chinese companies) of large infrastructure projects including a power plant, an airport, an extension of the existing port at Colombo accompanied by a brand-new financial district called the Colombo Port City, and an entirely new port at Hambantota.

The resulting scenario provides important lessons for governments lured by the promise of China's famous no-strings attached infrastructure financing. The power plant suffered numerous outages, the airport became the world's emptiest, and the Hambantota port was a commercial failure, getting hardly any ships. Commercial failures, meanwhile, meant that insufficient revenue was generated to cover loan repayments, creating distressed assets. For the debt-addled Sri Lankan government, the prospect of renegotiating these often-onerous loan agreements was hampered by a lack of transparency surrounding the precise terms of the original contracts, which removed the possibility of external checks and balances to hold the government accountable for negotiating good commercial deals. This in turn created the conditions for pork-barrel politics, in which projects were pursued not for the long-term economic benefit of the country but for political or personal benefit-building bridges where there were not rivers.
Unsurprisingly, these dynamics generated political tensions, and corruption allegations featured prominently in the 2015 Sri Lankan presidential election. The incumbent Rajapaksa administration was sensationally defeated, with the incoming government promising to extract Sri Lanka from the worst excesses of its China ties. Political will, however, could not overcome economic reality. By themselves, the under-performing projects may have been manageable, but combined with the overarching weaknesses of the Sri Lankan economy they became a crippling burden. A deteriorating balance-of-payments and falling foreign currency reserves were forcing authorities to rely on foreign financing to cover budget shortfalls and achieve economic growth. Amid such fragility and a lack of alternative sources of liquidity, the new government had little choice but to seek accommodation with Beijing, despite its political desires and commitments.
China's debt-financing has therefore yielded at least two strategic benefits: the Hambantota port itself, and more broadly the willingness of an otherwise skeptical government to maintain and even build upon positive bilateral relations. However, two major countervailing factors make it unlikely that these outcomes will translate into substantial gains on the security front. First, domestic sentiment in Sri Lanka has been increasingly hostile to Chinese finance. As with Chinese investments in many African countries, Sri Lankans have begun to resent Chinese state-owned enterprises for using predominantly Chinese labor and technical skill to build poorly-performing assets. In early 2017, for example, violent protests greeted Colombo's decision to clear land and resettle communities in the Hambantota port region in order to create an industrial zone for Chinese firms.
Second, Sri Lanka's neighbor to the north, India-a rising major power and regional competitor to China-plays an outsized role in Colombo's security calculations. New Delhi has long sought to keep external powers out of South Asia, and although this stance is currently changing, Beijing is not on the guest list. In fact, China is the cause of India's more active neighborhood diplomacy, including efforts to undermine Chinese influence in Sri Lanka; for example, by offering to buy the virtually defunct Hambantota airport and pushing to invest in the Eastern Container Terminal of the Colombo Port. Given Sri Lanka's historical, cultural, and social ties to India-there are at least 60 million Tamils in India and four million in Sri Lanka-it is unlikely that Colombo will make policy concessions that are overly prejudicial to New Delhi's interests.
Instead, we find that the Sri Lankan government has sought to maximize the benefits it can gain from the competition for investment and influence between China and India. Sri Lankan leaders have declared an omni-directional foreign policy that seeks to accommodate the interests of both great powers and in the process secure the best deal possible for Colombo's development plans. While infrastructure projects may struggle or fail and Beijing may lap up a distressed asset or two in the short term, the odds of this type of economic diplomacy successfully driving a wedge between India and Sri Lanka on the security front remain minimal.
Indeed, history shows that imperialism-of the creditor variety or otherwise-is a fraught and often unprofitable enterprise.

Drastic reforms to police force  Sagala Ratnayaka
Making a shocking revelation, Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development Sagala Ratnayaka admitted on popular social media platform Twitter that fundamentals on quelling tensions and operating guidelines may have been compromised during the Kataragama shooting.
The Minister was referring to an incident where a motorcyclist was shot dead by a police constable on Wedihitikanda Road in Kataragama town for allegedly failing to stop the vehicle for inspection. The incident sparked protests resulting in the arrests of several individuals. The shooting prompted a probe directed by Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundera who ordered a special team from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to investigate the fatal shooting.
Police themselves are subject to law. When quelling a tense situation or an unruly demonstration, justifiable force should be used, in strict adherence to operating guidelines. It appears to be that these fundamentals have not been followed in relation to Kataragama incident, the Minister said yesterday.
Inferring reforms of Sri Lanka Police, the Minister went on to add that the Kataragama incident is not an isolated one. This stems from lack of training and professionalism. Failure to address core issues diligently will throw us into similar situations time and time again. So, drastic reforms will soon be introduced to Police with help of foreign experts.
The Minister also added that he has communicated to the Secretary of the Ministry and IGP at a special meeting for action to be initiated against those responsible for the Kataragama incident.

The Supreme Court yesterday dismissed five writ petitions filed by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) or the Pohottuwa party.
The party challenged the Election Commissions decision to reject nomination papers for the Panadura and Weligama Urban Councils, Agalawatta Pradeshiya Sabha, Mahiyangana Pradeshiya Sabha and the Thirappane Pradeshiya Sabha.
The three-judge-bench of the Supreme Court comprising Justices Buwaneka Aluvihare, K.T. Chitrasiri and Vijith Malalgoda dismissed the petitions citing that there is no reason to grant relief on merit.
The writ petition filed by SLPP in respect of Maharagama Urban Council was also dismissed by Supreme Court last week.
The nomination papers handed by the SLPP in respect of Panadura Urban Council were rejected on the basis of a clerical mistake of non-insertion of a date and the place of attestation of the signature of the Secretary of the SLPP, in terms of section 28 (5) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance.
The petitioners including SLPP Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam had cited , District Returning Officers, Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and two other members of Election Commission, SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake, UNP General Secretary Kabir Hasheem, JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva and several others as respondents.

Heres Brazils  sand king!
For 22-years beach monarch Marcio Mizael Matolias has avoided high rents in an upscale district of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil by living in a sand castle. But his unusual home has not stopped the 44-year-old, known affectionately by locals as The King from pursuing his three passions: reading, golf and fishing.
Matolias has no trouble putting on a regal air and happy to pose on his throne in front of his castle, scepter in hand. However, unlike other monarchs, King Marcio is personally responsible for conducting repairs to his palace, whether its the dungeons or a door.
He also has to constantly water his home to keep it from collapsing, Lavoixdunord.fr. reports.
Despite this, Matolias says he would not have it any other way.
He said: I grew up in the Bay of Guanabara, I always lived on the beach. People pay exorbitant rents to live in front of the sea, I do not have bills and here I have a good life.
While grandiose on the outside and with views of the pricy beach area, his house is just three square metres and full of books.
Matolias, who is single and childless said there is just one drawback to his peaceful existence: The sand holds all the heat, so sometimes at night I can not sleep here, Ill spend the night at a friends house, but I prefer it here even if I have to lie outside by the sea, he said.

How can economists contribute to business strategy
The traditional role which has been played by economists, has been restricted to forecast economic issues, outline the ways in which they can be economically tackled and finally contribute towards economic policy-making.
Hence, one can criticize that economists play an advisory role rather than actively contributing to the production process in the economy. Furthermore, when other professionals work hard to produce whatever goods or services, economists keep advising how to do things. However, that era has gone away. Economists are required to not only forecast the economy but also contribute to business strategy.
Currently, economists business involvement has been limited to banks and finance companies. Many commercial banks have dedicated one of their board seats for economists.
Their duty could be to analyze investment opportunities, especially at stock market and bond market, minimize the risk which could be caused by government's economic policies such as budget and monetary policy. However, we can find out very rarely business organizations in which economists involvement is highly considered.
Relevance
Any business has to be operated in the economy, cannot avoid economics and its impact. Large corporations which are very sensitive to economic trends, have no economists on their board. Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy, governor of the Central Bank, served as a non-executive director at John Keells Holdings, Deshal De Mel, an economic advisor at the Finance ministry, was senior economist at Hayleys, can be considered exceptional examples where conglomerates in the country were concerned on the contribution of economists.
Economics trains people to see the big picture as well as divide that into parts and analyze through macroeconomics and microeconomics respectively.
Economics, being one of the oldest management subjects, laid the foundation for plenty of modern management theories such as consumer behavior.
Philip Kotler, considered the father of modern marketing and holding both master's and doctorate in economics, saw marketing as an essential part of economics, emphasizing that demand is influenced not only by price but also advertising and sales promotions.
Every subject and business is interrelated in this globalized world. Hence, let me explain how an economist can contribute to business strategy in the areas of marketing and human resource management.
Marketing
The study of consumer behavior is a big part in both economics and marketing. Economics is concerned as to why consumers buy products. Almost every marketing theory is based on utility theory which says consumers buy products to maximize their satisfaction.
Economists have to be good marketers that know how to maximize consumers satisfaction. Any product or service that is below consumer's budget line and generates lower utility than money, will not be bought by consumers.
Marketing strategy means the plan set by the company to reach the target customers based on market segmentation and turn them into consumers that buy company's products frequently. Economists should be able to make this marketing plan viable by introducing utility-maximizing products.
HRM
Labor is one of the production factors discussed in microeconomics. What Human Resource Management (HRM) is concerned is how labor can be trained to deliver the best service for consumers. Labor economics looks at supply and demand at the labor market and understands patterns of wages, employment and income.
The quality of labor which is caused by training and motivation can increase the quality of products, meaning that more cash inflows will ensure more productions and employments in the economy.
Human resource strategy means a set of traditional HR functions such as recruiting, training and succession planning to strategically contribute to the goals and future aspirations of the company, further creating comparatively advantageous workforce for the company. Economists should be there to advice on labor market trends, wages and any policy related to HRM.
Way forward
Experts are extinct in multi-disciplinary business environment, making the place for generalists.
Hence, economists also have to go beyond traditionally demarcated boundaries which can be said to have lowered employability of economists.
Business economics should be made popular in order to enable economists to contribute towards both policy-making and business strategy.

On the hunt for potential
I like to focus on we, rather than I. We, is a power word says Head Girl of Devi Balika Theshani Weligamage. Perfect Prefects Weligamages authority and vision depend on this core belief. She is ambitious, yet her ambition is for herself and for others. She and her fellow prefects are stronger together.
I always believe in humility and I like to be humble. I like to focus on us, rather than I. We is a power word which is why I like to focus on working together as a team because that is so important. I like to focus on that. Through that, I radiate positivity and get the work done. Apart from that I really believe in being committed, said Weligamage
Weligamage feels that Prefect-ship is such a great opportunity for a school student because when it comes to school life, it is not just about studying and excelling in academics. School life is one of the most important phases of your life.
Enriched life
It is where you acquire the knowledge that you need to win the world. You are able to cultivate good qualities. Prefect-ship is one of the key positions you can receive in a school and gives you a great opportunity to uplift yourself and improve yourself. I am really happy to be the Head Prefect and it has really enriched my life a lot, stated Weligamage.
Weligamage feels that it is important to have the heart as well as being intelligent. I like to be friendly and I want to be an accessible person. I also want to be compassionate. The sisters look up to me and my prefects. So it is important to set an example to them, said Weligamage.
She has greatly benefited from being educated at Devi Balika. It is where she has received opportunities to explore her potential.
I think joining the drama club has really given me great opportunities and broadened my horizons. I joined the English Drama Circle and the Sinhala Drama Circle and we have entered so many competitions and registered a lot of victories. That was a fun time and a time when I developed many good qualities and it was a great learning experience.
I still am a member of the media unit. I did some sports as well, such as rifle shooting, getting a sharpshooter badge. For three years in a row, I became a sharpshooter in rifle shooting. I took part in basketball, handball and netball. I was a member of the school choir. I was a member of the English Literary association as well, explained Weligamage.
She points out that when facing a problem, it is important that you do not lose your faith. You have to be dedicated and motivated and you have to hold on. That vibe of positivity is there when she faces obstacles.
Motivated patience
There are times when you feel down and your crew feels down, but you still need to be positive because your crew looks to you for some sign as to what to do, and you need to be strong for them. You need to believe that every problem has a solution. You also have to be patient. I believe in having patience because I need to motivate those under me, and make them feel positive, and make them feel we can succeed. I need to encourage them, added Weligamage
Weligamage believes that in order to see a change in the world, you need to be that change.
I like to make a difference in the world with what I am doing right now. How I behave and what I do, the example that I set is important. Because I believe that if you want to see a change in the world you have to start with yourself. In society, there are so many different people. We see a lot of problems in society. To make a difference you need to take a risk. You need to be who you want to be, said Weligamage.
Ambitious yet well grounded, Weligamage believes in herself and believes when selecting a job you need to learn your passions and potential. There is no rule that you need to be a doctor or engineer. Understand yourself and choose your profession.
So now I am doing languages at Devi Balika, I want to study well, but at the same time, I want to do extra-curricular activities and lead a balanced school life. And I want to be a good role model. I am interested in doing Law in the future and I am interested in foreign affairs, international relations and international law. I also am interested in the United Nations so I would like to step into that kind of field. Because all the fields connected to the UN seem very interesting to me. Even WHO is also a field that really interests me. I did SLMUN once, explained Weligamage.
Innocent crowd
The choices we make in life may have lifelong consequences. Which is why you need to think very carefully. Your choices will have an impact on your private life and sometimes it may have an impact on society. Sometimes youth tend to go to extremes. If they encounter an extremist, they might be attracted to these ideas and will go to a really dark and destructive place. Their lives will end in tragedy and along the way, they will hurt a lot of innocent people.
When you are a young person there is the possibility of you being brash. So before you take a choice you need to think if what you are trying to do is right or wrong. You need to be conscious of what you are doing. Many young people do not realize the potential within themselves. They need to power up this potential and unleash these talents. Young people have the power to radiate compassion, empathy and positivity. Those are much-needed qualities in the world. By being kind you can really make a difference in one persons life. You need to be careful about who you select as a role model because not everyone makes the world a better place, said Weligamage
Weligamage is very mindful of human rights. The safety of women is a human right. Education is a human right and is vital to the lives of young people.
But even today we see a lot of human rights violations. I would really like to talk about human rights violations and this applies to many societies in this world. Because this is what is lacking. To become a leader you need to be dedicated, you need to be able to delegate and you need to be an effective communicator. Be patient and whatever happens, carry on. And also be strong. I admire leaders like Abraham Lincoln and Barack Obama. Before being a leader you need to be a follower first. You need to be able to listen. So the right combination of charisma and those qualities can make you a leader. But to be a leader that actually does some good to the world you need to have the heart. That will make you a balanced person and a good leader, pointed out Weligamage
Good qualities
An only child in the family, her beloved father works abroad. Her mother gave up her job to be with Weligamage and took care of her. School is an important place in her life points out Weligamage. The people she has met in school and the situations she has encountered in Devi Balika have moulded her and helped develop her good qualities. She is who she is today because of her parents, school and friends.
At the same time, I really like my pastimes such as travelling, drama and reading books. At the same time, I approve of doing charity. I want to become a great asset to my country. These days I am reading a book by Ann Brashare  The Whole Thing Together. I also like to read Sherlock Holmes. I like books where the plot is mysterious. And I like suspense as well. I do like Adventure/ horror movies. I was a fan of Teen Wolf and Harry Potter as well! summed up Weligamage

I am against corruption - President
President Maithripala Sirisena requested Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to support him to bring culprits of the bond issue to book.
He was addressing a United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) rally in Kandy on Tuesday.
The President said those members of the G L Peiris party were saying that the scam has happened from 2015 to 2016, but he knew what those members did then and asked the Premier and his party members not to weaken him in the move to take measures against those who had misappropriated public money.
President Sirisena said the G L Peiris party members should not forget that the Supreme Court judges had clearly stated in the report that the fraud had been committed since 2008. He said that a forensic and audit reports had been called for this reason. He said what is needed at the moment was to punish all those involved in the racket.
The President said it was fair to follow lions rather than leading a pack of dogs. He said all who defrauded public money should be penalised.
That money should have been used to facilitate the poor. Although Mahinda Rajapaksa had requested people to join him as the government and opposition has proved a failure, he himself had failed at three occasions, the President said.
He said Mahinda Rajapaksa held the Presidential Election two years earlier since he failed to run the economy. He lost the election and the August election as well, President Sirisena said.
The people supported me against the corruption and I won on January 8, the President said.
President Sirisena said Mahinda Rajapaksa did not vote for the no faith motion against Ravi Karunanayake brought by the Joint Opposition, but he congratulated Ravi when he won it.

JVP lashes out at Rajapaksa
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) lashed out at former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on what it called a media statement which was full of lies and wrong interpretations released by Rajapaksa.
The remarks made in a media statement by the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his corrupt clan reflect the unfortunate political situation they are in, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) issuing a special statement said yesterday.
Referring to a media statement released under the signature of former President Rajapaksa, on January 21, the JVP said it is a case of undressing ones self in a glass box.
The JVP points out that the said media statement which was full of lies, wrong interpretations and allegations shed light to former President Rajapaksa and his clans political nakedness.
The JVP observes that Rajapaksas allegation that the certain committees to investigate into corruption to be under the monitoring of the JVP leader MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake to be completely baseless. If we were given such a power to investigate into corruption taken place in the country, former President Rajapaksa and his clan would not be leveling allegations at others.
The statement further points out that Rajapaksa needs to have a look at the website that monitors members of the parliament to figure out who properly fulfill the role of Opposition. It observes that JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake to be the most effectively active MP at the parliament where as Mahinda Rajapaksa listed at 184. The JVP questions as to who then fulfill the role of an active Opposition party, Rajapaksa or the JVP. They also points out that former President Rajapaksa always evades from being present at the parliament or refrain from voting whenever there is an important matter comes under the spotlight.
The JVP also states that it is their party who took the initial legal steps against Sunami Sahana Mandalaya and fought against the Cease Fire Agreement in 2002, not Mahinda Rajapaksa.
JVP refuses Rajapaksas allegation that Uma Oya project was implemented by the JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake when he was holding the position of Agriculture Minister. The statement points out that it was Rajapaksa who high handedly carried out the project without a Environment Impact Assessment while granting the contract to the project to an incapable Iranian company.
JVP also observes that such a statement is unbecoming coming from a former President of the country.
The present government has not outlined a new constitution as yet. We believe if we can pass a new constitution in parliament which will assure the rights of all the people in the country, strengthen democracy and abolish the executive presidency it would be a great achievement.
We know that we cannot defeat the attempt to divide the country cannot be nullified until we accept the rights of all ethnic communities and establish peace. the statement also said.

At least 22 dead in twin Benghazi car bombs

At least 22 people have been killed in two car bombs near a mosque in the Libyan city of Benghazi.
Varying reports say 20 to 30 more were wounded by the blasts, which took place within minutes of each other.
The first vehicle blew up in front of a mosque in the central al-Sleimani neighbourhood, as worshippers were leaving the building after evening prayers.
A second car exploded soon afterwards on the other side of the street.
Both military personnel and civilians are among the victims. The number of fatalities may rise, a spokeswoman for the local al-Jala hospital told AFP news agency.
It is not yet clear who was behind the bloodshed. The BBC's North Africa Correspondent Rana Jawad says many bombings of this kind go unclaimed in Libya.
A shocking night for Benghazi residents
A video showing the aftermath of the scene of the first explosion has been broadcast by a Libyan channel. You can see the debris outside the mosque, patches of fire, and men in civilian clothes frantically putting lifeless bodies onto the back of a police pick-up truck.
Amid this chaotic scene, we also see a dazed and seemingly injured man sitting amid the debris. Not far away from him are what look like other dead and injured people.
No one has claimed responsibility for this latest attack, but speculation is rife over who could be behind it. Though there have been deadly bombings in Libya in the past, this latest twin attack, with blasts 15 minutes apart, is not a common occurrence there. It appears to have aimed for a high civilian death toll.
Libya has descended into turmoil since the 2011 overthrow of its then-leader Muammar Gaddafi. Two rival parliaments and many powerful militia groups have battled for dominance, and the disruption has allowed the Islamic State group to gain a foothold in the country.
The city of Benghazi has seen conflict between Islamist militias and the self-styled Libyan National Army, headed by military strongman Khalifa Haftar.
Haftar announced the "total liberation" of the city in July 2017, after three years of fighting with jihadists there.
Nonetheless, clashes and violence have continued to plague Benghazi.

From Lincoln to Twain, Thurber and you
What is humour Asked the English teacher from her students. The students tried their best to respond by coming up with various responses.
Humour is one form of making people smile or laugh.
Good, said the teacher, adding: What more
Humour is a way of saying something in a witty manner.
Humour is a form of comedy or farce or a situation created in order to express something in a lighter vein.
Humour anthology
All these go to say that the term humour or as it is spelled in the UK as humour embraces various forms. We come across humour in the form of poems or limericks, dramatic situations, comical or comic forms, jokes and wise cracks, satire and a few other forms. Humour has come to stay as a literary form which expresses to prove a point to answer a question and just for the fun. Once the American writer Beatrice Shenk de Regniers in 1965 brought out an anthology of humour titled as The Abraham Lincoln Joke Book. Lincoln had said to himself: I laugh because I must not cry.
Lincoln had the saddest face I ever tried to paint, said Francis Carpenter, an artist. Carpenter lived in the White House while he was painting President Lincolns portrait. The artist cum painter Carpenter noticed that when the President fell saddest he would try to get relief by telling a joke or reading a book of humorous stories. As the compiler notes, Lincoln believed that jokes are good for children too. He thought that jokes and riddles were good fun and helped sharpen the wits.
Lincoln once agreed with a friend who said it was as important to teach jokes and riddles in school as it was to teach reading and writing and arithmetic. Walking along the area of shop soiled and second hand book stalls in Londons well known street, Tottenham Court Road, I once picked up a fascinating book titled as Composing Humour: Twain, Thurber and You (1972) compiled by Jean Sisk and Jean Saunders. As a reader, I was spellbound by the similarities and the dissimilarities of the two great humorists, Mark Twain (1835  1910) and James Thurber (1894  1961). Who is the better humorist may not be the question a reader would ask. But who is second to the other in their humorous expressions would be the question. Both of them, as humorists, excelled and taught the English-speaking world of their period of existence the most intelligent social lessons.
The anthology of humour compiled by Sisk and Saunders is meant to address the teacher and the student who so wants to understand teach and learn the literary genre humour taking into account two significant writers Twain and Thurber. The compilation is segmented into 12 short chapters clarifying basically the definition of wit and humour, examining the salient qualities that go into the making of humour. That is followed by an inquiry into the forms known as tales, jokes, jests and tall tales. In the case of Twain, some of the earliest narratives in and around Mississippi are taken into consideration the phases of getting to know the commonest masses who used humour as a form of expression to get rid of tiredness and anxiety. In this direction, the sayings of various groups of people living in the same social matrix are brought to light.
Print medium
In the case of Thurber, the creativity lies basically in the use of the print medium of the newspaper and the periodical with a mixture of the cartoon. Thurber in many ways resembled Twain, but the latter excelled in the use of humour as a social comment addressing the political issues indirectly.
Having laid down the spirit of humour in both Twain and Thurber, the two compilers raise a question from the reader. If someone were to ask you: Do you have a sense of humour, who would you say Your immediate response would almost inevitably be of course, doesnt everyone have a sense of humour
Well, at least everyone thinks he or she has. And yet you must have had the experience of watching others laugh hilariously at some joke you didnt think was funny, or worse still, of telling a joke that fell flat because no one laughed. Reading through the material as laid down on the subject of humour, one feels that humour is something that one should cultivate in order to get rid of various forms of ailments and anxieties caused as a result of stress, strain and tension. It is not easy as one imagines, coming back to Lincoln the President, once someone asked him who would be the next President.
He is supposed to have said:
I cannot say for certain who will be the peoples choice for President. But to the best of my belief, it will be the successful candidate.

On making a  Dictionary
Have our readers ever heard of Simon Cassie Chetty (1807-1860) Possibly not because he belonged to the 19th century, He was a Lankan belonging to what we call the Colombo Chetties originally from the Puttalam District. Their ancestors, like many of our ancestors, hailed from Southern India. But he was a pioneer in many fields contributing to varied aspects of literature.
We learn from Prof S Thillainaathan that this scholar was a linguist having known Sanskrit, Sinhala, Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Portuguese, and Dutch besides English and Tamil.
Gnanam Balachandran, a young independent researcher has codified different strings relating to the attempts made of making Dictionaries undertaken by Simon Cassie Chetty. Balachandran gave a speech on the subject at the Kolumbu Tamil Sangam two years ago and that is now available in a book of 52 pages priced at Rs 200. His father T Gnanasekeran edits a literary magazine called Gnanam. He in his foreword says:
Cassie Chetti was engaged in compiling dictionaries relating to medicine, books in Tamil, bilingual writing and on, borrowed words and classical words
The book is in Tamil and titled Saimon Cassie Chttyin Akaraathi Muyarchikal - Attempts at compiling Dictionary Simon Cassie Chetty.
Here are some main points from the book to persuade you to do your own research on Simon Cassie Chetty as a pioneer Lankan, who brought fame to this country,
u He was born on March 21, 1807, in Kalpiddy in Puttalam district.His fathers name was Gabriel Cheddi. He joined the Public Service as a translator and later admitted to the Administration Service. He was the first Lankan to be admitted as such an officer and the first Lankan District Judge to be appointed.
u He was also the first Lankan to have written a book in English. He was the author of the Ceylon Gazetteer in 1834. He was also the author of Tamil Plutarch
uAn excerpt from the foreword written by him for Ceylon Gazetter is as follows:
Before I conclude my prefatory remarks, I feel it necessary to entreat the indulgent public generously to make every allowance for any faults in composition which may appear in the following work: for I am sensible that I cannot stand the test of criticism, particularly as it regards, a knowledge of which language I possess very imperfectly; but as I have never received any systematic education, I trust it will improve. An apology for all errors
u Simon Cassie Chetty compiled a Medical Dictionary called Malaiyaha Aharaathi.
u His essay written in 1849 was titled An Outline of Natural History. This was published in the Journal of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol ii, No 5.
uHe died on May 11, 1807,
Gnanam Balachandran should be encouraged for his attempt to place the pioneers who have contributed to the evolution of Lankan Tamil Literature in a larger context of Tamil Studies. He can be contacted on 2586013.

Melodies for Colombo folks
Folk music when coupled with innovation evokes pleasant sensations and sheds light on the conservation of this art of heritage by way of attracting the new generation.
Jaffna Music Festival and Galle Music Festival conducted for the last nine years fostered the unique Sri Lankan folk music traditions, bringing together artistes of this sort scattered all around the island to a common platform. These twin music festivals were unveiled during a time when certain folk musicians had performance space only within their communities, and others barely had sufficient instruments and costumes to perform.
Thus Jaffna and Galle music festivals were conceived as a vehicle to enable Sri Lankan folk musicians to revitalise their music traditions and also to perform on a shared stage with international artistes. This endeavour enabled many artistes to receive acclaim for their work.
Some artistes who have first performed in these twin events now do public shows here and abroad.
With a view to taking this hale and hearty culture to more heterogeneous markets (new and smaller locations in the country), the organizers eventually have designed a new compact program branded as Melodies of Folk.
Melodies of Folk 2018 with its line-up of folk musicians reflect the diversity across ethnic groups and folk music traditions and contemporary musical innovations.
The maiden show at the Vihara Maha Devi open-air theatre on January 28 at 6.30pm will showcase a cross-section of Jaffna Music Festival and Galle Music Festival to astound the Colombo crowd. Some of Sri Lankas outstanding folk musicians will perform here.
Sri Lanka Norway Music Cooperation aka SLNMC presents Melodies of Folk 2018 and entrance is free for the general public.
SLNMC is funded by the Royal Norwegian Embassy and implemented by Kulturtaken, Norway and Sevalanka Foundation partnered with the Folk Music Conservation Centre of the Department of Cultural Affairs.
The event will feature Ravibandu Drum Ensemble, Naadro and nATANDA, Baliphonics, Sandasi Drummers, Miyesi Jana Sangeetha Kandayama and Tamil Murasu and international folk sensation Chirkutt from Bangladesh.
Going hand in hand at the same venue is Music is for All mini-event starting at 9.30 am, which is a festival for children and families that create spaces for children to interact with folk musicians of Islamic Social Heritage Cultural Association.
The line up for Music is for All include, (Sufi) from Akkaraipathu, Portuguese Burghers from Batticaloa, the Ceylon Kaffir from Sirambiadi, Saranga Rookada Group from Ambalangoda, Parai Melam from Batticaloa, Mullaitivu Kalaimakal Kala Manram Valankum Karakaddam and Kudamothal Kummi from Mullaitivu, Sandasi Beat Drummers from Colombo, Sulochana Dissanayake from Power of Play and Music Maters and plenty of other child friendly activities.
With Sri Lanka, Norway Music Cooperations artistic director Dr Sumudi Suraweera and Sulochana Suraweera we did three School events (Paasal Charika) and all these events will be included in the morning session, said Sevalanka Foundations Director, Kaushalya Navaratne.
She further commented, We constantly meet at Jaffna, Batticaloa, Colombo and Peradeniya universities to discuss on conservation and innovation of folk music. At these Musical Meeting Places university students get-together to discuss, practice and innovate folk music. We will showcase the outcome of this in the morning session. Anusha Gokula of Folk music conservation centre too is actively present in this endeavour.
The legendary local artiste Dr Arunthathy Sri Ranganathan said, Art and culture could bring diverse communities together. In my whole life I have worked on bringing artistes together. Classical music is from the West and Oriental music is from India. But folk music is deeply rooted with our own culture and heritage. We are happy to see the new generation learning and researching on folk music that sheds light on festival songs, ritual songs, Nadagam Gee and musical dramas.

A move Sri Lanka may rue
Wins by the Sri Lanka cricket team in the one-day format have today become so few and far between that any win is looked forward to with eager and anticipation that with it the side would come out of the rut it has fallen into. Two back to back defeats in the ongoing Bangladesh one-day Tri-series was not the ideal start for the New Year for Sri Lanka who had gone through a rather lean period in 2017 losing 23 of the 29 ODIs played. However with their backs against the wall and facing an early exit after the two defeats, Sri Lanka had a must win game against Zimbabwe on Sunday to stay in the tournament.
They came out with all guns blazing to beat Zimbabwe and keep their chances of qualifying for the final alive. However the manner in which they got about winning the match was far from convincing. Having restricted Zimbabwe to a total of 198, Sri Lanka were well on course to knock the runs off inside 40 overs and earn a bonus point as well with the win and thus put themselves in a position to qualify for the final. But from a position of strength at 103-1 in the 22nd over Sri Lanka stumbled to 117-4 in the 26th in what has now become an all too familiar middle order collapse. They lost the wickets of two set batsmen Kusal Perera and Kusal Mendis who had put on 70 for the second wicket, and Niroshan Dickwella for 14 runs within the space of 22 balls.
At this point if Sri Lanka had played their cards right they could have still grabbed that extra bonus point and at the same time pushed their net run rate to the plus mark had they sent the inform Thisara Perera ahead of Asela Gunaratne to join the captain Dinesh Chandimal. Gunaratne coming at this stage was a very bad tactical move by the team management. He was totally out of touch and wasted 21 balls for 9 runs and during his period at the wicket Sri Lanka managed only 28 runs off 55 balls. If Sri Lanka fails to qualify for the final they would rue that move. As it was, Thisara Pereras arrival at the wicket saw Sri Lanka knock off the required runs of 57 in 10.1 overs. The question that begs to be answered is what role was Gunaratne playing  was he played as a batsman or an all-rounder He bowled just one over for four runs.
BOYAGODA PROVES A POINT TO TOUR MANAGEMENT
Sri Lankas exit from the ongoing ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup Super League in New Zealand could easily be put down to bungling team compositions that saw them lose to Afghanistan and Pakistan and being demoted to play in the Plate Championships for places ninth and below with countries like Kenya, Canada, Papua New Guinea, Namibia, Ireland, West Indies and Zimbabwe. Sri Lanka had only one win in the group matches where they got their combination right and beat Ireland by seven wickets, but after that for no apparent reason they dropped their key opener Hasitha Boyagoda from the next two games against Afghanistan and Pakistan and played an extra fast bowler instead and paid the penalty. Boyagoda was Sri Lankas match winner against the eventual winners Afghanistan in the Under 19 Asia Cup scoring a brilliant half century but in the U19 World Cup practice match against New Zealand he was sent to bat at number 8 and yet made a half century. However his failure to score runs against Ireland saw him being dropped for the next two matches which was crucial to Sri Lankas chances of playing in the Super League. Sri Lanka played an unchanged side against Afghanistan and Pakistan - two teams they met in the U19 Asia Cup, and lost to them both. The team combination for these two games was to say the least appalling. It seemed that Sri Lanka had not learnt their lessons from the U19 Asia Cup. Against Pakistan who had a surfeit of left-hand batsmen in their line-up they failed to play an off-spinner who could spin the ball away from the bat. Boyagoda was one of three openers selected for the U19 World Cup the other two being Dananjaya Lakshan and Santosh Gunathilaka. But in the U19 World Cup, they promoted Nipun Dananjaya who had never opened for his school as opener against Afghanistan and Pakistan and the results were disastrous. He failed to get into double figures in any of the matches. To prove a point to the tour management (that comprises coach Roy Dias, manager Mahinda Halangoda, fast bowling coach Chaminda Vaas, fielding coach Upul Chandana and selector on tour Graeme Labrooy) Boyagoda who was recalled to the team for the Plate quarterfinal match against Kenya yesterday hit a staggering 191 off 152 balls to record the highest ever Under 19 ODI score.
Then there was the case of all-rounder Jehan Daniel who bats regularly at no. 6 or 7 being pushed up the order to no. 4. What the team management failed to understand is that an important event such as the U19 World Cup is not the place to experiment with positions. The players should have been told what their roles and positions are very much prior to the event which in this case was sadly lacking. Further, the individuals who were in a better position to help decide the team compositions were the junior selectors who had followed the players right from the initial stages, and should have gone on the tour as one of the tour selectors. Where Sri Lanka erred was when Sri Lanka Cricket decided to shift the balance of power of under 19 selections from the junior selection committee to the senior selection committee. The senior selection committee has hardly any time to follow the under 19 cricketers and therefore were not in any position to take decisions concerning team combinations. In that aspect it is hard to understand why SLC decided to send a member of the senior selection committee to accompany the Under 19 team to the World Cup rather than a junior selector who could have given more inputs into team combinations.
By such thoughtless thinking the SLC has let slip another golden opportunity of winning a junior cricket World Cup. The nearest Sri Lanka has come to winning one was in 2000 when they finished runner-up to India when it was hosted in Colombo and reached the semi-finals on two other occasions in 2010 and 2016.

MRs selective amnesia
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, these days, is so engrossed in the pohottuwa election campaign that he is given to laspses of memory. Addressing an election meeting in Mahaiyawa, Kandy, Rajapaksa accused IGP Pujith Jayasundera of supporting the Yahapalanaya election campaign. Basing his conclusion to a comment made by the IGP during an address to police officers in Vavunia, Rajapaksa accused the police chief of implicitly urging his officers to vote for the Yahapalanaya at the mini-poll. He charged the IGP for doing propaganda work for the government.
If what Rajapaksa says is a fact it behoves the authorities to bring this matter to the notice of the IGP and warn him against such improprieties. There should be no room for tampering with the electoral process under Yahapalanaya. Safeguards are already in place to keep all irregularities in check. After all, we now have a fully functional Elections Commission which is acting impartially and has inspired the confidence of all political parties. Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya has even gone to extent of putting on notice government politicians who flout election laws.
Openings of so called development projects have been put on hold, or done with an explicit proviso that it is public funds that are being utilized on such projects and not those of the government ministers. Strict surveillance is also being done on the distribution of freebies to influence voters- a far cry from the Rajapaksa days when dansal hosted at Temple Trees were the order of the day, in the run up to elections. This was in addition to the abuse of state resources and the deployment of Samurdhi officers for election work.
It would be appropriate here to refresh the memory of Rajapaksa, who is complaining about the involvement of the IGP in the current election campaign, on the scenario with regard to the last Provincial Council Election, held for the Northern Province. Rajapaksa, who, subsequent to his presidential election defeat claimed that he was done in by the Tigers, thereby branding all Tamil voters as LTTEers, had no compunction in utilizing the services of Retired Major General G.A. Chandrasiri, who was his handpicked Governor for the Province, to openly address political rallies in the north, in violation of election laws. In accusing the IGP, it was the position of Rajapaksa that the police chief had no right to engage in politics, and, that, his primary duty is to ensure law and order and security in the country.
It is regrettable that Rajapaksa dispensed with all such lofty ideals as to the specific duty assigned to a Governor of a Province, at the time, when he allowed Major General Chandrasiri to address the voters in the north, from a political platform. One also recalls how former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa openly addressed election rallies in support of his elder brothers candidature, at the last presidential election. Nay, special interviews were given by Rajapaksa junior to selected private television channels wherein he hailed the leadership given to the war victory by his brother and the looming threat of a reappearance of the LTTE should the result go in favour of the Common Candidate. Mahinda Rajapaksa, on all those occasions, had no qualms whatsoever in shamelessly using a state official, who happened to be his sibling, to do political work on his behalf. Now, by taking up cudgels against the IGP, the former president is only demonstrating the selective amnesia that often besets politicians when painted into a corner.
Rajapaksa, has, also, in his speech, at the election rally, striven to extract maximum political capital out of the shooting incident in Kataragama, where, a youth, fleeing police orders to stop, at a security check point, was gunned down by a police constable. In yet another attempt to give the incident a communal colouring, as is his wont, Rajapaksa claimed that while youth were being shot dead in the south by the police those in the north were given the kid glove treatment, implying that the government, while accommodative of the Tamils, were discriminating against the Sinhala youth. He said; police were killing people in Kataragama and they were not doing it in Jaffna, as quoted in an English daily.
Here too, Rajapaksa needs a jogging of memory, which, one suspects, is shrinking away due to advancing years, or, the whole exercise is a deliberate ploy to win votes by playing the communal card.
It was hardly six months ago that a similar incident took place in Jaffna, where, both, a motorcyclist, and a youth on the pillion were killed, when police manning a road block shot at the fleeing duo. Rajapaksa could not have been unaware of the conflagration that ensued in the north, where there were massive protests, and the policeman concerned arrested, like the PC in Kataragama has been arrested.
What makes Rajapaksa think that the two incidents are poles apart Is it because he feels that Basil Rajapaksas efforts to create a political presence for pohottuwa in the north had come a cropper and it was best that he (MR) places all eggs in the southern basket

New spider species  named after literary  characters
Scientists in Brazil have discovered seven new species of spiders and named them after characters from literary classics - including Lord Varys from the Game of Thrones and Aragog from the Harry Potter series.
The Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion, H P Lovecrafts The Call of Cthulhu and the childrens favourite Charlottes Web and Little Miss Spider also inspired the names of small cave-dwelling six-eyed spiders inhabiting northern Brazil.
The new species, discovered by scientists from Instituto Butantan, Sao Paulo, all belong to the same Neotropical genus Ochyrocera.
While all seven previously unknown species prefer staying in the shadows underground, none of them has the adaptations characteristic for exclusively cave-dwelling organisms, such as loss of pigmentation and reduced or missing eyes.
They are classified as edaphic troglophile species, which means that they are capable of completing their life cycle away from sunlight, but are not bound to the deepest recesses.
Often crawling near the surface, they can even be spotted outside the caves. To describe the species, the scientists collected about 2,000 adult specimens following a five-year series of field collection trips.
The list of fantasy spiders begins with Ochyrocera varys named after Lord Varys from George R R Martins book series A Song of Ice and Fire, which inspired the popular TV series Game of Thrones.
Lord Varys is also known as the Spider because of his manipulative skills and ability to weave and command his networks of eyes-and-ears across two continents.
Two species are named after spider characters from the classic works by J R R Tolkien. Ochyrocera laracna is a species named after the well- known giant spider Laracna (Shelob in English) who attacks main characters Frodo and Sam on their way to Mordor in The Lord of the Rings second volume  The Two Towers.
On the other hand, the Brazilian spiders sibling - Ochyrocera ungoliant - is linked to Laracnas mother. Ungoliant appears in Tolkiens book The Silmarillion, whose events take place prior to those of The Lord of the Rings second volume The Two Towers. According to the story, Ungoliant translates to Dark Spider in Elvish.
Another staple in the 20th-century fantasy literature, the Harry Potter series, written by J K Rowling, enjoys the attention of the researchers.
The species Ochyrocera aragogue is an explicit reference to the talking Aragog, who lives in the dark recesses of the Forbidden Forest. In the second volume of the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, he confronts Harry Potter and Ron Weasley.
The name of Ochyrocera atlachnacha refers to the Spider God Atlach-Nacha from the universe created by H P Lovecraft. Atlach-Nacha is a giant spider with a human-like face which lives in the caves beneath a mountain and spins a web believed to link the world with the Dreamlands.
The authors do not fail to pay tribute to much less violent spiders known from popular children books. David Kirks Little Miss Spider inspires the name of Ochyrocera misspider.
The Ochyrocera charlotte species refers to Charlotte, the spider from E B Whites classic Charlottes Web who befriends the main character - Wilbur the pig.

Party Leaders Meeting to decide Treasury Bond debate date
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said the date for the debate of the Treasury Bond issue will be fixed today at the Party Leaders Meeting.
It has been scheduled to hold the Party Leaders Meeting today under the leadership of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya aiming to fix a date for the debate of the Treasury Bond issue.
The Minister was addressing media at SLFP Headquarters, yesterday.
He added that Parliament has received the full report of the Treasury Bond issue and there are no missing pages. The Parliament received the full report, which contains 963 pages, apart from several annexes. The entire report with all the annexes can be obtained through the mediation of the speaker if any parliamentarian wants to have it.
All the annexes can be obtained by the Speaker if needed, he added.
Unlike during the previous regime, the judiciary of the country is now impartial. It is so powerful and strong, the Minister said while speaking on the reason why the President called for the Supreme Courts determination on his term.
Unlike during the last regime, President Maithripala Sirisena never threatens the Chief Justice after summoning him to Temple Trees. He never interferes with the judiciary, Minister Samarasinghe alleged.
The independence of the judiciary is evident when considering the Supreme Courts decision on the Presidents term.
The Minister further added that the judiciary has the freedom now unlike during the previous regime.
The Minister recalled how former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake was removed from her post by leveling baseless allegations and a case filed against her husband during the previous regime.
The Supreme Courts decision on the Presidents term symbolizes that there is an independent judiciary in the country, he noted.
Minister Samarasinghe said President Sirisena is enriched with diplomatic qualities than with those of a politician.
The Minister highly condemned the behavior of the former Uva Chief Minister in connection with allegations connected to the Principal of a girls school. An impartial investigation in to this matter is ongoing, he said.
Speaking on the Trade Union action of the Hambantota Port employees, who lost their jobs with the transshipment of management to a Chinese Company, the Minister said that of the 464 employees, 135 will be recruited to the Port Authority while the others will receive a compensation over Rs one million each.
Each employee except the 135 persons, who are going to be recruited to the Ports Authority, will receive compensation amounting at least Rs 1 million. The 135 persons will be selected through an impartial, transparent interview process. Right after the election, measures will be taken to recruit those 135 persons, he said.

PM lauds FTA with Singapore
Shortly after the government signed a new Free Trade Agreement with Singapore, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka must make even more deals to its economy to grow.
For every foreign investment, there are Sri Lankan rupees earned, he said. There is a lot of hope in this agreement, the Prime Minister said
The Prime Minister was speaking at the 59th Annual General Meeting of the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka at the Kingsbury Hotel last evening.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that the government was already negotiating a new Free Trade Agreement with India.
The main point is the removal of non-tariff barriers, he said.
Another trade deal with China is in the works, the Prime Minister added.
(There) is a market of over 3.5 billion people at our door step, he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that in order for businesses to succeed there must be a paradigm shift to make our economy more outward-looking. He added that politics should not get in the way of development.
This government finally wants Sri Lanka to be successful, he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that the Anti-Dumping Bill, which would ensure that best practices are implemented in following free trade agreements, would appear in Parliament this week, and that he expected it to pass.
The government had originally wanted the bill passed before signing the deal with Singapore, the Premier said.
Speaking of last years deal to lease part of the Hambantota port to China, the Prime Minister said the Port had been a white elephant.
Now weve come to a joint venture agreement,the Hambantota harbour will be taken over, he said. Of the $1.3 billion repaid, we have already been paid $200 million  and additional $600 million has been requested.
If the deal sparks new developments like an oil refinery, in the end, you yourself will be compensated, he said.

PM requests Bohras help for investment conference in Mumbai
Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe has asked Syedna Aaliqadr Mufaddal Saifuddin, the 53rd Dai-Al-Mutlaq and current leader of the Dawoodi Bohra community, to help the Sri Lankan government hold an international investment conference in Mumbai in September this year.
The Premier made this request to the Spiritual Leader, who was on a visit to the island country, when he called on him in Colombo on Monday.
Saifuddin assured his fullest support to the Prime Minister and his government.
The Dawoodi Bohras, a global community of Shia Muslims whose spiritual center is in Mumbai, are a thriving business community.
Wickremesinghe described Bohras as a business community which minds its business and lives in peace and harmony with other communities in Sri Lanka and elsewhere in the world.
You have played a significant role in the economic development of Sri Lanka, the Prime Minister said.
On his part, Saifuddin pledged the communitys support to Sri Lankas development, and wished the Prime Minister continued success in serving the people of the island nation for many more years to come.
The meeting between the Prime Minister and the Spiritual Leader was meant to mark the 70th year of Sri Lankas independence and the 40th year of the Prime Ministers political life.
Sri Lankan Bohra Community officials who were present at the meeting told the Prime Minister about the local communitys desire to hold the next Moharram in Colombo on a massive scale with 40,000 to 50,000 participants from abroad and sought the governments help to organize it. The Prime Minister said that he would certainly extend all help.
The Syedna also told the Prime Minister of his communitys desire to work for the development of war-devastated Jaffna and the Northern Province which had a strong resident Bohra community before the war started.
Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin has visited Jaffna three times and has helped renovate the Bohra mosque on Hospital Road in Jaffna. He is keen that the Bohra community should go back and endeavor to re-start or start new businesses and entrepreneurial activities there.
The Prime Minister welcomed the idea of increasing investments in Jaffna. He also thanked the Spiritual Leader for visiting the island country.

PRECIFAC recommends filing indictment against MR
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) has recommended filing indictment against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa over the non-payment of money to the Independent Television Network (ITN) for his campaign advertisements in the run up to the 2015 Presidential Polls.
PRECIFAC has held him responsible for committing one or more offenses of corruption, conspiring for corruption and encouraging corruption.
In its final report, it has recommended filing indictment on former ITN Chairman Anura Siriwardena, former ITN Deputy General Manager (Marketing) Upali Ranjith, former ITN Assistant Manager Dilip Wickramasinghe, and former President Rajapaksa for committing the above offences.

The Commission has also held them responsible for non-recovery of Rs.2.4 million owed to the ITN from Special Solutions which handled Rajapaksas campaign advertisements. It had also held them responsible for charging double amount for campaign advertisements of Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena.

Railway Drivers Union Secretary Indika Dodangoda speaking to the Daily News said they had resorted to such action over technical issues in the Chinese trains and the termination of employment of contract workers for having participated in their previous strike in December 2017.
We have constantly complained to the authorities that there are technical faults in the Chinese trains. There are break defects but as of recently, they have started to penalize the drivers for the breakdowns in the trains. We have proof that this is due to technical problems and they need to be fixed, but the General Manager is not prepared to listen, Dodangoda explained.
Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry Secretary G.S. Withanage however noted that the unions wanted the re-employment of retired workers who were on contract basis, Whether extensions are given to retired employees is dependent on the requirement of the railways. It is an administrative decision, how can a union demand that, he asked.

Remembered  with affection
Why would anyone get into the hearty, yet heartbreaking, singing business There must be times when all the agony pays off  when, for instance, you get to stage a strange local ballet without betraying yourself. Rukmani Devi is best known as the local nightingale.
What the majority of the younger generation would not know is that Rukmani Devi was not much conversant in Sinhalese though she voiced lyrics of that language. That remains not to be a talent, but a legacy. Probably why the younger generation still follows her songs knowingly or unknowingly.
A big secret is that singing quietly requires just as much air as singing loudly. Singing quietly is also a lot harder to sustain than singing loudly, because for loud sounds you can use projection to make your voice carry. With singing quietly, you have to sustain your voice with breathing and air supply rather than projection. So during a quiet passage, or in a more tender song like a ballad, make sure you remember to breathe!
Rukmani Devi had the best technique and most consistent live vocal performances. You may have listened to many older, revered solo artists, who may have incredible expression and great technique as well, and other current solo artists and groups, but Rukmani Devi is still better vocally. Her technique and resulting sound is consistently on pitch, resonant and free of strain. Her warm timbre just makes everything that much better.
She had amazing pitch control and good vocal range, but most importantly it is her diction and pronunciation of words that Rukmani Devi stand out, never slurring or pronouncing them in a strange manner.
A grand musical concert was organised at the Tower Hall to commemorate Rukmani Devi recently. Sri Lanka Sakala Kala Association President Sriyani Disanayaka has now made it a custom to organise a concert, on an annual basis, in memory of the legendary songstress. Dissanayake, herself a veteran dancer, singer and actress sang about 25 songs of Rukmani Devi. She was accompanied by H R Soysa, Upali Kannangara, Ishak Beig and Extreme Youth Association Maharagama. Amali Star Dance Guild was responsible for choreography. Priyanka Perera and Sri Mal Liyanage compered the event.
The proceeds of the concert will be channelled to the neglected, disabled and forgotten soldiers, underprivileged children, and to repair the Rukmani Devi monument. A standing ovation was delivered with a thundering applause from the audience when the song Nili Rajina Kokilawi Tribute was sung by Sriyani Dissanayake, of which the lyrics were composed by Dr Ajantha Ranasinghe.
The silent, yet mesmerized, audience really enjoyed the soft singing, music and heart-soothing lyrics voiced by Sriyani Dissanayake. These songs were indeed meaningful in contrast to noisy songs and music heard in todays platforms.

Results of SL economic reforms to show from 2018 - Economist
The results of the economic reforms adopted by the government would start to show from 2018 and Sri Lanka could look at a 5% economic growth this year said, Economist, South Asia, Standard Chartered Saurav Anand.
Speaking at an interactive media roundtable following the banks 2018 year a head briefing and the publication of Our Global Focus he said that revenue-led fiscal consolidation too is continuing but at a slower pace.
We expect growth in the US and euro area to exceed 10-year averages, although this is not a particularly high bar.Growth in India should recover but we think expectations of rate hikes in 2018 are premature. In the ASEAN region, Thailands growth could positively surprise after years of underperformance.
David Mann, Chief Economist, Standard Chartered said that they expect solid global growth of 3.9% in 2018, similar to 2017.
He predicted that China will likely contribute 62% of global growth in 2018.
Chinas growth is likely to slow, but not aggressively. We expect the tightening of financial-sector leverage to continue. The market has finally adopted a two-way risk mentality on the direction of the exchange rate.
Commenting on the ASEAN region he said that economies with proactive government investment in infrastructure projects including Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand should be supported, even if external demand is softer than in 2017.
Sarah Hewin, Economist, Europe, Standard Chartered said that the Euro area is likely to experience strong growth as the region puts crisis years behind it on the back of buoyant domestic demand and accommodative policy.
Politics will be in focus, with risks around Italys election and Brexit negotiations, he said.

RESURRECTING THE RUSSIAN GREATS
Recalling such experience is so fresh in my mind and no doubt fascinating when the London Philharmonic Orchestra turned eight at the South Bank Centre with Russian classics under the baton of Vladimir Jurowski.
The LPO and Russian music are inseparable and who but Jurowski can resurrect such composers from their graves like he did from the land fabled for its snow-covered winters and a history rich with drama and literature.
The variety of riches that Russian music offers the world from the Romantic passion of Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov along with the brilliance of Stravinsky and Prokofiev among the many greats that have come under the baton of Jurowski is simply marvellous. His passionate orchestral works extend not only to Russian spirit but rest of the other great composers. Jurowoski provides the Russian style in his own inimitable way on equal terms to the greats of Great Britain and all countries in the region but remain more identified as the great translator or the Russian classics.
Incidentally, he told us all that over a decade ago before the PLO reached seventy-five years of age how the Seventh Symphony of Shostakovich was premiered.
The kind of orchestration involved in this composers magnificent symphony gripped the music world as no other at that time and ten years later, Jurowaski stood on the same spot to wield the baton on the Seventh Symphony.
SEVENTH SYMPHONY A some-what confused composer especially traced in most of his symphonies other than in Symphony No. 10 in E minor, because he worked on a personal monogram that was compelled after Stalins death that reflected the passing of the dark ages in Russia. It was not meant that way though acclaimed as his finest achievement.
That cannot be said of the Seventh Symphony that Jurowski elected to play as a tribute to the Russian masters. During the 1941 siege of Leningrad by the Nazis he completed the Seventh Symphony. From the sublime to banal, he used dissonant harmonies. His worst music is full of cliches and however much he tried to conceal the hidden codes is a matter of conjecture.
Perhaps a Russian master like Jurowski can unravel the secret dissidents and probably did when he conducted the Seventh Symphony. I must admit those intricacies were beyond my musical knowledge and Shostakovich was never my favourite. I still cannot fathom his music except Symphony No. 13.
From Shostakovick, he took charge of Stravinsky, Prokofiev, Tchiakovsky among others after a run-up to ORANGO, an unfinished opera which was recently discovered scored by Shostakovich.
Jurowski is the life and soul of the London Philharmonic Orchestra as the Principal Conductor and Artistic Advisor at the South Bank, brings more intensely Romantic music from his country. But his genius is not only confined to Russia, he puts every representative country whose music comes under his direction, the same passion and loyalty. He adores classics of Great Brittain.
This night, I heard him play Benjamin Brittens SINFONIA da REQUIEM and Vaughn Williams SYMPHONY No. 6 which I thought was better that Shostokavich Symphony No. 6. Today, it was also different because for the first time Jurowski combined The London Philharmonic Orchestra with the Russian National Orchestra. He also announced that the RNO to be the leading Russian Orchestra at the time.
What would the LPO have done without Jurowski to Russian music
Not much I believe. His passion for his country ; the love for her classical music is his priority wherever he performs. By the time LPO reached eighty years, Jurowski was such an integrate part of it that the Telegraph remarked Under Jurowski the LPO has become a fabulously refined instrument
Very keen to bring to London one form or another in A FLORENTINE TRAGEDY, an operatic master piece by Alexander Zemlinsky which he did on a later date, revealed his extraordinary talent renowned for his thought provoking and beautifully crafted programmes. I also missed THE RITE OF SPRING by Stravinsky and some works of Richard Strauss. All the Strauss clan are my firm favorites among Vienese composers. I am an addict to Vienese waltz and they are brilliant at it and famously played in all ball-room floors.
In between Tchaikovskys Sixth Symphony, PATHETIQUE was gloriously conducted to a highly appreciative audience. PATHETIQUE was scored in 1893 and Tchaikovsky was invited to Cambridge to receive an Honorary Doctorate of Music. Here, it must be elaborated that PATHETIQUE No. 6 in B minor, Op. 74 is still the greatest of this genre.
Exactly why the composer chose not to divulge the programme was in his own words Let them puzzle their heads over it Later we were to learn the psychology behind it when Havelock Ellis, famous for his STUDIES IN THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SEX called the score a homosexual tragedy and became a lament for woe especially in the final Movement.
The pessimistic utterance in all music proves this. PATHETIQU is a proof that Tchaikovsky was happiest when sad. No doubt, the score lived up to its name.
And Jurowski brought out the essence of this tragedy, live to music lovers and enhanced their ardour towards Tchaikovsky.
Jurowski was also billed to perform the following day combing the LPO with the London Philharmonic choir because the extraordinary symphonic music of British tradition to be followed. WAR AND PEACE was on top of the series.
What does Jurowski do to be what he is today
Plenty: study the creators works or the composers notes and attempts to become the voice of the creator. He tries to inspire and encourage the audience and create an environment for his musicians to be at their best. It is far more complex role than most of us see sitting and watching him move arms. He makes most instruments in his orchestra sing or sound like singing the score that is being played.
That is the genius of Vladimir Jurowski and tonight Russian music became the winner.

SAITM: SLMC to discuss recommendations on Jan 26
The Attorney General yesterday informed Supreme Court that a nine-member committee appointed to look into the progress of implementation of the recommendations made by the Presidential Committee has submitted its report pertaining to the SAITM issue.
"Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) will hold a meeting on January 26 to discuss the recommendations made by a nine-member committee," Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam said.
Additional Solicitor General Rajaratnam appearing on behalf of the Attorney General made these remarks when the appeal petition pertaining to the SAITM issue was taken up before Supreme Court.
On a previous occasion, a majority of a divided three-judge Supreme Court Bench granted special leave to appeal with a petition filed by Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) challenging the judgement of Court of Appeal to register a student of South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) in Malabe provisionally as a medical practitioner in terms of Section 29(2) of the Medical Ordinance.
The Supreme Court three-judge bench headed by Justice Eva Wanasundara fixed the matter for argument on January 29. On a previous occasion, the Supreme Court had allowed Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) to intervene into the appeal filed by the SLMC. Through this appeal petition, the SLMC sought an order to set aside the judgement dated January 31, 2017, by Court of Appeal.
The petitioner further sought an interim order to stay the operation of the judgement made in the writ application bearing No.CA Writ 187/2016 by Court of Appeal.
Delivering its judgement on the writ petition filed by a MBBS graduate SAITM in Malabe, the Court of Appeal on January 31, 2017, held that SAITM is empowered to grant MBBS degrees and further held that the petitioner has legal rights to register at the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) as a medical practitioner in accordance with the Medical Ordinance.
The Court of Appeal had observed that the petitioner, a MBBS graduate of SAITM, has no obstacle to register at SLMC as a medical practitioner in terms of the Section 29(2) of the Medical Ordinance.
The Court of Appeal observed that on or around August 30, 2011, the former Higher Education Minister recognised SAITM as a degree awarding institute in terms of Section 25 (A) of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978.
The Court of Appeal further observed that the Higher Education Minister has not taken any steps to revoke the concerned decision in terms of Section 27 of the said Act.
SAITM is empowered to grant MBBS degree, the Court observed.
In its judgement, the Court of Appeal observed that the SLMC has no power to take over the functions of the Higher Education Minister and further observed that the SLMC had acted in violation of Section 19 of the Medical Ordinance when making regulations relating to SAITM.
The Court further held that the SLMC had acted in violation of the Medical Ordinance without having any power to do so.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for the SLMC. Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva with Sugath Caldera appeared for the respondent. Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam PC appeared on behalf of the Attorney General.

The second law of CEO communication
The second law of CEO Communication is for the leader to connect emotionally with her audience. This is generally done by telling stories or anecdotes.
The best recent example of this is Oprah's acceptance speech at the Golden Globe Awards. In a speech of less than 9 minutes, she used 4 stories and anecdotes to illustrate her points. The result People start to view her as a possible contender for the US Presidency in 2020! Such is the power of stories.
In 2004, a totally unknown provincial politician by the name of Barack Hussein Obama delivered a speech at that year's Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Boston, Massachusetts.
Four years later this very same unknown politician became the President of the United States, beating the much better known candidate Senator John McCain. What did the trick Obama's defining speech at the 2004 DNC convention.
The speech was a series of stories and anecdotes in which headeptly weaved his own life story with that of the American Dream,and the values that sustain it. The upshot His ability to tell stories put Obama in the White House.
In fact, the common denominator of most great leaders has been their ability to tell stories - and thereby connect emotionally with their followers.
From the great religious leaders to Mahatma Gandhi, from Abraham Lincoln to Winston Churchill, from JFK to Reagan, from Henry Ford to Steve Jobs, from Richard Branson to Elon Musk - all have been ableto connect with their audiences and achieve great things by telling stories. In other words, a hallmark of outstanding leaders is great storytelling.
Great companies are places where their culture and ethos are carried from generation to generation through stories and anecdotes of their own leaders. Leadership and Executive Coach, Mentor, and Consultant Ronnie Peiris says such corporate storytelling is like Greek myths - they sustain corporate culture and values over the long haul.
Top CEO Communicator Giam Swiegers says, if I can give leaders one bit of advice about improving communication skills: spend a bit of time understanding how you tell stories.
Today,workplace employee engagement is at record lows worldwide, therefore leaders at every level need to use every single tool in the CEO Communication tool box to engage employees to achieve outstanding results.
The ability to connect with audiences emotionally by telling stories and anecdotes is one of the best tools CEOs have to inspire their people to achieve great things. As the Native American proverb goes,Tell me the facts and I'll learn.
Tell me the truth and I'll believe. But tell me a story and it will live in my heart forever.
As a CEO on a quest to build a great company or team, you want your people to remember, hopefully forever, what you say.

Shakib inspires Bangladesh to crushing win over Zimbabwe
DHAKA: Star allrounder Shakib Al Hasan smashed a half-century and claimed three wickets as Bangladesh thrashed Zimbabwe by 91 runs in a tri-nation one-day international tournament in Dhaka on Tuesday.
Chasing 217 for victory, Zimbabwe were bundled out for 125 off 36.3 overs after Shakib took 3-34 with his left-arm spin for the hosts.
Shakib and opener Tamim Iqbal, who top-scored with 76, set up the win as they shared 106 runs for the second wicket after Bangladesh elected to bat first.
Zimbabwe skipper Graeme Cremer claimed four wickets to restrict Bangladesh to a modest 216-9 despite a strong start provided by Tamim.
The left-handed Tamim registered his third half-century in as many matches, becoming the first Bangladeshi to amass 6,000 ODI runs in the process. He was also named man of the match.
Bangladesh collapsed from 147-2 to 170-8 with paceman Kyle Jarvis grabbing three wickets for 42 runs.
Number-10 batsman Mustafizur Rahman struck an unbeaten 18 to take Bangladesh past the 200-run mark and complete their full quota of 50 overs.
Zimbabwe were dealt early blows as Shakib and Bangladesh skipper Mashrafe Mortaza tore through the opposition top order.
They were unable to overcome the damage despite middle-order batsman Sikandar Raza's gritty 39 off 59 balls -- the highest of the innings.
Mustafizur (2-16) ended the resistance of Raza, who dragged a short-pitched delivery onto his stumps.
Mortaza and left-arm spinner Sunzamul Islam also took two wickets each.
Zimbabwe still has a chance to join Bangladesh in the final on January 27 provided the hosts beat Sri Lanka by a good margin in the final league game on Thursday. AFP

SLSFTA to renew trade relations with Asia
Sri Lanka will sign a Free Trade Agreement with Singapore aiming at reforming of Sri Lankas trade and trade related policies.
The Sri Lanka Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA) is a land mark agreement as it is the first trade agreement that Sri Lanka is signing in over 10 years and it is the first comprehensive agreement for Sri Lanka beyond Trade in Goods.
According to a statement issued by the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, negotiations of SLSFTA commence in August 2016 after signing of the joint statement of Singapore and Sri Lanka during the official visit of Sri Lankas Prime Minister to Singapore.
The SLSFTA is part of a broader strategy of looking East to renew Sri Lankas trade relationships in the process of diversifying our markets towards Asia and focus on plugging in to Asian supply chains. This is the first agreement that Sri Lanka is entering into with a South East Asian nation and it would help close integration with ASEAN.
Singapore is at present the seventh largest investor of Sri Lanka having invested (FDI) around US$ 658 million during 2005  2017 through over 119 Singaporean companies operating in Sri Lanka. The sectors which attracted investments include IT, real estate, manufacturing construction renewable energy and pharmaceuticals.
The full statement issued by the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade.
Sri Lanka Singapore Free Trade Agreement: Gateway to integrate with advanced economies
1. Policy
The development policy of the government aims primarily at maximizing the economic benefits through integration in to global economy, attracting Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) in strategic sectors and improving export competitiveness.It is widely understood from the beginning that this requires policy, legal and institutional reforms in line with the todays global trends. One of the pillars of this strategy is establishing effective partnerships with strategically selected economies.
Lack of a clear vision and coherent trade policy that provides benchmarks to govern and guide the administration and conduct of international trade has resulted in the development of ad-hoc and often conflicting rules, regulations and practices that affected adversely on the expansion of trade. Therefore, government adopted a New Trade Policy bringing different elements of trade policy into one platform essentially with reforms connected to increase competitiveness, expand market access and trade facilitation, create macroeconomic balance, bring policy and institutional coherence and adjustment of firms and people.
The Cabinet approval was granted to the New Trade Policy on the basis that it gives precedence to unilateral reforms, makes trade agreements consistent, gives emphasis to reduce protection rates and reduce their variance and given the challenge of increasing exports rapidly, assures existing barriers to private sectors adjustment and access to needed inputs are assured and trade policy making institutions are strengthened with competent and sufficient staff.
Accordingly, the government started negotiations with three key economies namely Singapore, China and India. Sri Lanka expects to foster freer trade flows and create stronger ties with these trading partners, eliminate para tariffs, promote regional integration, enhance the competitiveness and deliver enhanced trading opportunities.
2. Process
The negotiations of Sri Lanka  Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA)commenced in August 2016after signing of the joint statement of Singapore and Sri Lanka, during the official visit of Sri Lankas Prime Minister to Singapore in 18-19 July 2016. Eight Rounds of Negotiations have been completed and as a result, the agreement has come to the final stage in January 2018.
The Ministry has taken every effort to ensure the process of negotiations to be transparent, inclusive and incorporates the interest of all stakeholders as well as to secure the national interests.
The negotiations were done through a Trade Negotiations Team approved by the Cabinet and it was supported by subcommittees appointed, covering all the areas under the SLSFTA and they provided technical level inputs during the negotiation process. The Sub Committees were comprised of all relevant government agencies responsible for each subjects. Further, steps have been taken to have an observer representing private sector to participate in trade negotiations.
In addition, the ministry obtained views of various stakeholders such as professional associations, chambers from private sector through consultations and with reference to policy, technical and regulatory aspects, the respective government agencies were consulted. More than 15 consultative meetings with private sector representatives have been conducted since August 2016 and wide range of subjects coming under each area and specifically on the adjusting domestic regulatory framework to secure national interests has been discussed.
Although there was a policy decision taken by the government not to take any commitments or any opening in relation to Free Movement of Natural Persons, yet there were concerns expressed by stakeholders that lack of regulatory mechanism domestically would create possible negative effects on domestic labour market. The United Professional Movement (UPM) assisted the process by submitting a comprehensive proposal on National Policy Framework and National Registration Process identifying the major legal shortcomings in the Sri Lankan legal systems in terms of liberalization. It included large number amendments to Acts and enactments of new acts in a wider range of areas/subjects. However, considering the mandate and the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Development Strategies & International Trade, the consensus was reached to prioritize the amendments to address the concerns in phased out manner through short-term and long term measures.
The initial study on the domestic regulatory mechanism revealed lacuna in the existing regime and identified that addressing the Immigration and Emigration laws as a requisite in order to have a streamlined transparent process with respect to foreigners coming into Sri Lanka. A special team of senior officials from the Attorney Generals Department was appointed for this purpose and consultations were held with the professional associations and chambers, covering wide sphere of sectors on the present regulatory mechanisms in Sri Lanka.As a short term measure, from trade remedies side for the protection of industries perspective it was focused on submitting a Safeguard Bill to prevent the companies from the sudden surge in imports due to fluctuation in the world market and the Anti dumping & Countervailing Bill to protect local industries from possible unfair trade practices due to dumping (selling at artificially low price) and subsidies given by other countries. These two Bills will be hopefully tabled at Parliament for approval in the next few days. In terms of professional services, the final clearance is awaited for the new immigration regulations drafted to address the current procedure which was claimed to be ad-hoc andnot transparent. Through the new regulations it is expected to create a transparent and balanced immigration procedure for foreign workers. However, in the longer term, a complete overhaul of the Immigration Act is to be done hopefully by early next year.
The National Human Resources Development Council Sri Lanka (NHRDCSL), which is the central entity endowed with National Human Resources Development Council (NHRDC) too would play a major role in relation to foreign employees. The above team is in the process of finalizing the necessary amendments to the Act of NHRDC and handed over the drafted amendments to the NHRDC for further comments.These enactments would provide required legal background to streamline the processes in labour market, foreign employees in Sri Lanka in particular, which in turn facilitate the operationalization of Free Trade Agreements, once these are in force.
3. Scope
SLSFTA includes several provisions aiming at reforming of Sri Lankas trade and trade-related policies or systems that will help in showcasing the trade-friendly framework of the government internationally. These will provide for modernization of different systems, anchoring of external investment in the country, and better and more predictable policy environment. Therefore, SLSFTA is a way to demonstrate Sri Lankas openness to investments internationally and domestically. This will also help to encourage the growth, development and nimbleness of Sri Lankas private sector.
Sri Lanka- Singapore FTA is a landmark agreement as it is the first trade agreement that Sri Lanka is signing in over 10 years and it is the first comprehensive agreement for Sri Lanka beyond Trade in Goods. SLSFTA basically covers the areas of Services, Investment, Sanitary &Phyto  Sanitary (SPS) measures & Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), Trade Remedies & Dispute Settlement, Customs Cooperation & Trade Facilitation, Economic & Technological Cooperation, Government Procurement, E  Commerce and Intellectual Property Rights as well.
Opening up the services market, absorbing the international best practices in the area of trade and facilitating the process of attracting investments are the major drives for negotiating a free trade agreement with Singapore which is unilaterally 99% liberalized goods market. In 2016, bilateral trade volume (goods) stood as high as US $ 1.15 billion and there is a great potential for further expansion benefitting both countries. In the area of Trade in Goods, Singapore has already applied zero rate of duty to 99% of their tariff lines.
The Singapore-Sri Lanka FTA is part of a broader strategy of looking East to renew our trade relationships in the process of diversifying our markets towards Asia and focus on plugging in to Asian supply chains. This FTA is our first agreement with a South East Asian country  and we envisage this as a first step towards closer integration with ASEAN, and potentially be part of the RCEP  Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership in the future.
Singapore is Sri Lankas 20th export destination and 08th trading partner. In terms of trade in goods, Singapore is not a significant export market of Sri Lanka. But, being an important member of the ASEAN with a high trade to GDP ratio (168.5% worlds highest whereas Sri Lanka ratio is 24.7%), FTA with Singapore will provide Sri Lanka a gateway to larger ASEAN market as Singapore has so far signed 21 free trade agreements with 32 trading partners.Currently Sri Lankas exports to Singapore is limited to Electrical & Electronic Products, Parts & Machinery, Petroleum Products, Apparel, Food, Feed, Beverages & Tobacco.
There is a greater potential for Sri Lanka to export certain products such as t-shirts, mens & womens suits, jerseys, new pneumatic tyres of rubber, mens suits, pepper, light-vessels, fire-float, articles of vulcanized rubber and precious stones & semi-precious stones. Both countries will mutually benefit with greater investment from Singapore in these sectors.
Singapore is at present the seventh largest investor of Sri Lanka having invested (FDI) around US$ 658 Mn during 2005-2017 3rd Q. through over 119 Singaporean companies operating in Sri Lanka. The sectors which attracted investments include IT, real estate, manufacturing, construction, renewable energy and pharmaceuticals. It is expected that the protection to be given under SLSFTA to investors and to their investments will result in substantial increase in FDI from Singapore by Sri Lanka offering good potential for Singapore companies looking to tap opportunities in new markets. It would result in the opportunities in Sri Lanka to Singapore companies and international companies based in Singapore. Sri Lankan companies who have invested more than US$ 120 Mn in Singapore will also benefit.
Entering into a FTA with Singapore, being the most liberalized economy in the region, will give a positive note on Sri Lanka as it demonstrates that both countries are open for business and encourage investments. Partnering with such an economy which is rule based, globally dynamic and with advanced managerial/institutional competencies will obviously trigger and contribute healthy reforms which in turn will move the country to the next level of economic development.

Solanra Solar panels contributes to national electricity grid
Solanra Pvt Ltd, the sole agent for German made Jurawatt Solar panels contributes to the national electricity grid with 1000 kilowatts power in 2017
SolanraPvt Ltd has met their target of contributing to the national electricity grid with 1000 kilo watts powerwithin one year usingGerman made Jurawatt solar panels. Solanra commissioned in 2012is the sole agent in Sri Lanka for Jurawatt solar panels, world's number one German solar panelfor tropical countries and geographical locations with desserts.
SolanraPvt Ltdrecently held a felicitation ceremony at Grand Monarch hotel, Thalawatugodato appreciate its loyal customerstowards the object of adding 1000 kilowatts electricity to the national gridbefore end of 2017. The event was graced bySolanra Company's CEO Mr. Kingsley Jayawardene, who is a senior electrical engineer and anexperienced consultant in renewable energyfor European countries.
Each Jurawattsolar panel installed by the Solanra has a 35 year warranty. These solar panels are the most suited ones for extram climatic and geographical conditions that prevail in Sri Lanka. Jurawatt solar panels have many unique attributes that other solar panels being used in the country do not have. Its core competency is it has 125 centigrade Maximum Absorb Temperature. Usually in Sri Lanka absorbed solar panels temperature increasesabove 80 centigrade. Solar panels with the capacity to absorb highertemperature fail in functioning as a result and reduce their lifetime by years.
In addition, the Austrian made Fronius Inverter used with Juarawatt solar panels has the ability to generate power even at a time when there is very little sunlight. It generates power from 6am to 6pm. Thus it is super flex design and perfect answer to irregularly shaped or different roof orientations and Fronius inverter has WLAN or Ethernet internet connection to monitor remotely..
Jurawatt solar panelalso has self-cleaning mechanism to clean bird droppings and dust plusthe strength to safeguard its components against animals like monkeys that intrude.
Shirley Jayawardene, Managing Director, SolanraPvt Ltd commented, Jurawatt solar panel sold by our company is the best product for tropical countries and it is already endorsed by our loyal customers and service providers who are being felicitated today.
He added, We constantly receive new orders for Jurawatt solar panels due to referrals by our existence customers. They spread the good news about our product amongst their peers. Our CEO,Mr. Kingsley Jayawardenewho is the founder of the company is a senior electrical engineer and a senior consultant in renewable energy for European countries, UK ,Germany ,Sweden, India and China. He is an expert in the sphere who knows what product is best for Sri Lanka. Hence our customers could rely on Jurawatt solar panels and they could consider themselves as winners.
Common solar panels in the marketplace could absorb only a temperature of 85 centigrade. But in many seasons we experience temperature rising to greater levels. You can experience that by touching the body of a vehicle parked in the hot sun. Hence a solar panel that has the capacity to absorb temperature up to 125 centigrade is the ideal one for the Sri Lankan context.

Spanish women want Woody Allen statue removed
SPAIN: Woody Allen's affection for New York is well known. But over the years, he's celebrated other cities, too. The director has spent several weeks in the city of Oviedo, in northern Spain. He described the city as delicious, exotic, beautiful, clean, lovely, tranquil and pedestrianised, and even set his 2008 film Vicky Christina Barcelona there.
The city has returned the favour. The Princess of Asturias Foundation (previously the Prince of Asturias Foundation) awarded him Spain's most prestigious arts prize, the Prince of Asturias, in 2002. The awards are presented in Oviedo, the capital of the Principality of Asturias.
A year later, officials installed a life-size statue of the director on a shopping street. The bronze statue was designed by Spanish sculptor Vincente Menendez Santarua. Allen has even dropped by to take photographs with his metal doppelganger.
Now, though, a prominent women's group want the statue gone. It is petitioning city hall to remove the statue in light of allegations that Allen molested his 7-year-old adopted daughter. In a letter, the Asturias Feminist Organisation argued that the statue of Allen honours an abuser and pervert. Oviedo officials say they'll consider the proposal during a forthcoming meeting.
The group is responding to allegations - first levelled decades ago - that Allen molested Dylan Farrow, the daughter he adopted with ex-partner Mia Farrow, when she was 7 years old. (Allen has denied the allegations and suggested that Dylan Farrow and Mia Farrow fabricated the claims because of a bitter custody battle.)
In 2014, Dylan Farrow wrote about her experience in the New York Times. In that piece, she explained:
When I was seven years old, Woody Allen took me by the hand and led me into a dim, closet-like attic on the second floor of our house. He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother's electric train set. Then he sexually assaulted me. He talked to me while he did it, whispering that I was a good girl, that this was our secret, promising that we'd go to Paris and I'd be a star in his movies.
I remember staring at that toy train, focusing on it as it travelled in its circle around the attic. To this day, I find it difficult to look at toy trains.
Dylan Farrow and her brother Ronan Farrow have asked actors and actresses not to accept roles in Allen's films, a campaign that's taken off thanks to the #MeToo campaign. Several actors - including Greta Gerwig, Ellen Page, Colin Firth, Mira Sorvino, Natalie Portman and Reese Witherspoon - have said they believe Dylan Farrow and would not work with Allen again.
Others, including Rebecca Hall and Timothee Chalamet, have donated the salaries they were paid working on Allen's films to campaigns targeting sexual harassment.
The backlash has gotten so strong that it's unclear whether - and how - Allen's latest film, A Rainy Day in New York will be released.
Working with Allen is extremely toxic, and why would you want to surround yourself and your career with potential damaging consequences Danny Deraney, a Los Angeles public relations executive who does crisis communications for celebrities, told the Guardian.
I don't think your performance will be taken seriously. Everyone will be looking at: why did you do it

SRI LANKA - THE GATEWAY TO SOUTH ASIA
COLOMBO: With more than 40 years in Sri Lanka, Singapore brand Prima is a household name in the country.
The company, which entered the country in 1977, started out as a flour mill but has since grown from strength to strength, expanding into baking industry training, feed milling, commercial poultry farming and even IT services.
Today, it is one of Sri Lankas largest foreign investors. When it first tried to make inroads into the country, Primas group General Manager for Sri Lanka Tan Beng Chuan recalled that people felt it was a risky venture.
We were the first one from Singapore to come in, he said, explaining how they had entered at a time when the countrys economic policies were becoming more open.
We had already been supplying flour to the country, and we knew the Sri Lankan market for a long time.
Through this time, we knew the government has never defaulted on their commitment.
Over the years, the 71-year-old Tan has borne witness to Sri Lankas development  and the emerging opportunities the country offers for Singapore companies.
There are many more skyscrapers now and construction going on in the last few years, he said. It is very much the same as in Singapore, in the old days.
Over the years, more Singapore companies have been venturing into Sri Lanka. Today, there are about 90 Singapore companies in the country.
An upcoming Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which is due to be signed by Singapore and Sri Lanka over the course of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loongs official visit to Sri Lanka from Monday (Jan 22) to Wednesday, is a boon for these companies, and an encouraging development for those looking to enter.
A GATEWAY TO THE REST OF SOUTH ASIA
When looking to expand its anchor brand Pasta Mania into the South Asia region, Singapore-based investment company Commonwealth Capital opted to open its flagship outlet in Sri Lankas commercial capital Colombo.
Describing the country as the gateway to South Asia, the companys Executive Director of International Business Wilson Lim explained that Sri Lankas per capita income is double that of India and triple of Bangladesh.
With a population of more than 1 million people, Colombo also serves as a very good test bed for us to bring in our concepts and acclimatise our brand before expanding into the larger South Asian nations, he added. 
It helps us to understand the cultural nuances of the South Asian countries, and localise the menu to get it right.
The same goes for the founder of the Star Anise Boutique Hotel Vigneswaran Mohan, who saw a niche in the Sri Lankan market for accommodation catering to luxury backpackers.
When I came here six years back, I saw there were bunk beds catering to the low-end backpackers, and the high-end hotels, he explained. This concept was doing quite well in Singapore, so I thought, why not
Established in 2016, his capsule hotel can accommodate up to 44 guests and boasts clean toilets and comfortable beds.
Vigneswaran said, he sees about 90 to 95 percent occupancy on average and the business is on track to break-even in July. Together with his Sri Lankan business partner, he hopes to set up two more hotels, a travel agency and a Singapore-style hospitality corporate training institute.
Sri Lanka is booming, and there are a lot of opportunities here to try out a new industry, he said, pointing out that infrastructure in the country has improved significantly since the end of the civil war in 2009. Its strategically located between Southeast Asia and the Middle East, and in a way, it reflects South Asia generally, but with less red tape, he added. So if you want to do something in India, try it in Sri Lanka.
WORKING AROUND THE CHALLENGES
The companies also highlighted the challenges they faced.
Commonwealth Capitals Lim pointed out the high tariffs and copious amount of documentation required to import food items into Sri Lanka.
What is in the food, do you have this test report So you really need to have strong local business partners who can help smoothen the whole process. To that end, Lim has been working around the challenges by looking at what ingredients can be sourced locally.
We are looking at leveraging on local ingredients, vis-a-vis proprietary items like pasta and tomato sauce, he said. Sri Lanka is very rich in seafood items, so why cant we work on a pasta thats related to say, Sri Lankan crabs
Meanwhile, Star Anises Vigneswaran described getting skilled labour as a very big problem, recounting how, three months after he opened, he had to fire his entire housekeeping staff when he caught them stealing from the guests.
He explained: Quite a bit of the Sri Lankan population is overseas, and people here arent fully trained, especially in the hospitality industry. Thats why we want to set up the institute to train people to work at different levels, whether its hospitality, tourism, office or admin.
Nonetheless, the companies are looking forward to the upcoming signing of the FTA.
Singapore businesses will be at an advantage compared to others, said Star Anises Vigneswaran. The Chinese and Indians are also here. If we have an FTA, Singapore businesses can come in, and theres also an incentive for local businesses to work with them.
From the perspective of reducing taxation, customs duties and tariffs for our food items coming into Sri Lanka, thats going to be highly beneficial for us, added Commonwealth Capitals Lim.

Sri Lanka to hold World Health Day 2018
The World Health Day 2018 will be held in Sri Lanka under the theme 'Universal Health Coverage (UHC)'.
Director General (DG) of the World Health Organization (WHO) Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced the decision in Geneva during the 142nd Session of the Executive Board of the WHO yesterday.
The DG congratulating Sri Lanka, which celebrates its 70th Independence Anniversary next month, said, "there is no more fitting place for this event, as you know, Sri Lanka has a long history of providing free healthcare for its people.
In response Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, who is attending the WHO Executive Board as a Member, thanked the Director General of the WHO on the selection of Sri Lanka to celebrate the important event. He said Sri Lanka looks forward to welcoming Dr. Tedros and high-level officials of the WHO including the Regional Director, SEAR to the event.
The Minister said that Sri Lanka was considered by most experts as a low cost, high impact, model of health care in South East Asia and the world. "My country has eliminated malaria, filariasis and neonatal tetanus as public health problems. Good achievements in maternal and child healthcare, high life expectancy, and near universal child immunization coverage were also achieved, the Minister said.
Minister Dr. Senaratne highlighted the challenges countries like Sri Lanka face - fast ageing populations, very high burden from NCDs, minimal and often inadequate elderly care packages and services and inequitable access to services for the disabled and vulnerable populations. He said these services need to be strengthened.
Sri Lanka urged the DG/WHO to sustain strong political advocacy at global level for UHC and also to consider putting together a binding international convention on improving coverage, access, financial protection and quality of care in support of UHC.
The Sri Lanka delegation to the 142nd Executive Board of the WHO includes Sri Lanka's Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva Ravinatha Aryasinha; Dr. Anil Jasinghe, Director General Health; Dr. Palitha Abeykoon, Chairman, National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol; Dr. Champika Wickramasinghe, Deputy Director General/Non-communicable Diseases;, Dr. A.I. Jagoda, Director Health Information, and Dulmini Dahanayake, Second Secretary of the Sri Lanka Permanent Mission to the UN in Geneva.

Sri Lanka, Singapore FTA sealed
Sri Lanka entered into a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Singapore at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday (23), making it the first trade agreement that Sri Lanka has signed in the last decade.
This was the key event of the three day official visit of Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong who is in the country on the invitation of President Maithripala Sirisena.The signing of the agreement was preceded by bilateral talks held between the two countries.
The FTA will boost trade between the two countries and will be the first comprehensive agreement for Sri Lanka beyond the trade in goods.
It covers the areas of services, investment, sanitary and phyto-sanitary (SPS) measures and technical barriers to trade (TBT), trade remedies and dispute settlement, customs cooperation and trade facilitation, economic and technological cooperation, government procurement, e-commerce and intellectual property rights.
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister, Malik Samarawickrama and Singapore Trade and Industry Minister, S. Iswaran signed the Free Trade Agreement on behalf of their respective Governments, in the presence of President Sirisena, Prime Minister Lee and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.
This is also the first FTA with a South East Asian country and according to the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, it is part of a wider Look East strategy. While Singapore is not a major trading partner of Sri Lanka, it is believed that it will provide the country with a gateway to other ASEAN countries and their markets.
Negotiations for an FTA with Singapore started in August 2016 in the wake of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes official visit to the country in July of that year.
In 2016 bilateral trade volume (goods) stood at USD 1.15 billion and it is hoped that the FTA would expand this further, accruing benefits to both countries.

Toddy tappers FR petition dismissed
The Supreme Court yesterday refused to grant leave to proceed with a Fundamental Rights petition filed by a toddy tapper.
Gamaralalage Siril Kumara of Kitulgala challenged the activities of Kitulgala police in producing persons who refuse to comply with their demand to provide free toddy, before Courts on illicit liquor offences.
The Supreme Court two-judge-bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep and Justice Sisira de Abrew refused to grant leave to proceed with the petition, citing that there is no legal basis to proceed with the petition.
Siril Kumara filed this petition along with two other his relatives.He named Inspector Chanaka Wijeratne, the OIC of Kithulgala Police Station, SI Gunasena, SI Senaratne, Sergeant Sandamal, Sergeant Guanwardena of Kitulgala police station and IGP Pujith Jayasundara as respondents.
The petitioners stated that officers of the Kitulgala Police engage in the wrongful and illegal practice of requiring persons engaged in the lawful business of toddy tapping in the Kitulgala area to bribe the said officers with quantities of toddy for their consumption.
They said Kitulgala Police engage in the wrongful and illegal practice of producing persons who refuse to comply with the demand to provide toddy free before courts on charges of brewing illicit liquor to meet prosecution targets set by the superior officers.
Such persons prosecuted in such a manner are compelled to plead guilty for the possession of illicit liquor and pay penalties ranging from Rs.1,000 to Rs.15,000. The failure to comply with such illegal demands results with further harassment and intimidation by the police officers, they alleged in the petition.
The Petitioners stated on July 28, 2017 at around 4.30 pm the 3rd and 4th Respondents arrived at the 1st Petitioners residence and took into possession a small quantity of toddy which was lawfully tapped by the first petitioner and claimed that the 1st Petitioner has illegally tapped toddy.
They further sought Rs.5 million as compensation from the respondents.
The petition had been filed through counsel Thisya Weragoda, Iresh Seneviratne and Niluka Dissanayake.

UK government borrowing nearly halved in December from a year earlier, helped by a rebate from the European Union.
Public sector borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, fell to a lower-than-expected 2.6bn last month, a 2.5bn fall from December 2016.
The UK received a 1,2bn rebate from the EU due to a reduction in the bloc's budget and changes to contributions.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also noted the collapse of Carillion could affect public finances.The ONS said that the government had stated it would provide funding required by the Official Receiver to maintain public services.

Uva Chief Minister chamara surrenders, granted bail
The Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dassanayake who surrendered to the Badulla Police yesterday through his attorney was later granted bail after being produced before the Badulla District Court.
He was facing charges of having made the Badulla Tamil Maha Vidyalaya Principal kneel before him, for not accepting a letter given by him for the admission of a student to that school.
He surrendered to the Badulla Police last morning and was produced before the Badulla District Court yesterday afternoon.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has instructed the Education Secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi to conduct an investigation into the incident on the manner in which the zonal education officials and the principal had acted with regard to this issue. He also ordered an investigation into the actions of the Chief Minister and whether he had put pressure on education officers.
The Minister noted that initially with the said principal denying these allegations it had seemed like a political incident, but with the information into the incident coming to light, the need for a comprehensive investigation had arisen.
Therefore, the Education Minister had instructed his Secretary to investigate allegations leveled against the Uva Provincial Education Secretary and other education officials for having tried to hide the incident and the manner in which they had acted and give him a detailed report pertaining to this incident.
Ceylon Teachers Union General Secretary, Joseph Stalin expressed objection to the Chief Minister being granted bail. The Ceylon Teachers Union staged a protest in Armour Street, Colombo in protest of the leniency shown towards the Chief Minister.
This is a complete drama and we are totally against the Chief Minister being granted bail. Further, none of the education officials including the Provincial Education Secretary, Director and others were penalised for having tried to cover up this incident.
"They should have been removed for having acted in this manner, but nothing was done, he told the Daily News.
Stalin warned that they would continue their action until those responsible for this incident are punished accordingly.

Great many students, parents, teachers and other literary enthusiasts who came to me the other day wanted me to air their views in the national press on the above matter of national importance without delay due to many a reason. Immediately after my return from Australia after my sojourn there, they were troubling my life out to register their protest against an injustice they had had to endure in silence as most of the English teachers who handle the subject at the school level seem to be unable to write to a national newspaper on behalf of their children. Therefore the writer thought of writing to the newspaper with the largest readership to take this crucial matter for discussion across the country. In a sense, I have the right to do so as I have perpetually pointed out many a defect in question paper methodology since the new syllabus came into effect in 2011.
One such article written by me is on sidelining of John Dryden and Alexander Pope in the A/L question paper since the beginning of the syllabus, because of that they had given a context question on Drydens poem for eight marks where they could easily do justice to the above poets by setting an essay type question. They had given Shakespeare a number of times, the same question projected in round about ways.
I sincerely hope that the relevant authorities would wake up from their slumber and come forward for a national debate on this matter giving an opportunity to the victimized parties to submit their diatribe to have a redress. The million dollar question is that why the veteran teachers are keeping silence when their students are getting deprived of the opportunity of entering the university in an age the country needs more and more English graduates and anglophiles.
English writers
In the wake of the colonial rule Queens lingo became very popular among the locals for many a reason. The first and the foremost was that it was the passport for white collar jobs. The administrative machinery demanded efficient administrators with a sound knowledge in English. English language became the lingua franca in the postmodern Sri Lanka in course of time. English literature acquired its due place in the national curriculum with the passage of time. Passage to India became our constant reader and thus English Literature enjoyed pride of place in the society even though it took some time to come to the rural schools.
The results of English Literature at the G.C.E. (O/L) examination marked a steady progress through the years and the newly passed out English trained teacher from the teachers colleges and the few graduates from the universities took the task as their national responsibility paving the way for a new set of writers in English.
I personally feel unhappy about the tragedy of the low past rate of students as the rural students seem to have been affected deplorably. It seems a sudden phenomenon. Galle and Matara districts which could boast of a number of A passes during the last decade have not scored a single A pass this time. Why is the sudden downfall Have those veteran teachers who had been leaving no stone unturned to guide their students to score A passes been suddenly transferred to Colombo and Kandy districts I heard on the school grapevine that the marking panels had been consisted of only university dons, not the practicing A/L classroom teachers. I do not have the slightest hesitation that their standard of English could have been lower, they are the masters. There are some veteran professors that even by reading the prescribed texts before one week could produce marking with surgical accuracy. Yet, new brooms sweep well, old ones know the corners! The sudden downward trend of the results away from the capital and salubrious Kandy spontaneously raises our eyebrows.
Equal opportunities in education
The tragic fall would compel the students to go to other subjects. The number of ordinary passes at the periphery would not augur well for the future of the subject. Under these circumstances a fair and impartial investigation into this matter would encourage the rural children to learn English literaturefor their degree at the university.
Teaching and learning English literature gathered momentum during the last decade as it took the childrens future to dizzy heights. Most of the students who offered English literature became attorneys at law, diplomats, writers, critics and good translators to meet the demand of the nation. Equal opportunities in education are a fundamental right in a just society.
I wonder how the curve of the unusual behaviour of the A/L English literature results been given in the final analysis of the data for future purposes. It seems the time is ripen to reconsider the question paper methodology and marking pattern of this subject for the good of the students, leniency towards them is not unjustifiable.

Woman power
We take immense pleasure and pride in producing the world first female Prime Minister Srimavo Bandaranaike in 1960 and her daughter Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga the first female president in 1994. It is ideal now to explore the history of female participation in Sri Lankan politics in the past to have a clear picture.
The establishment of universal suffrage in Sri Lanka in 1931 offered women the right to vote on the same basis as men. Just three years later, women in Great Britain and rightly more than a decade in the United States obtained this right. Ceylon was the first British Colony to achieve universal suffrage and no woman contested the first elections to the State Council.
However, in November 1931, following the death of her father, Adeleine Molamure contested the Ruwanwella seat and won with a majority of over 9,000. Naysur Saravanamuttu was the second woman to be elected to the State Council from Colombo North. At the first Parliament post-Independence, in 1948, only two women were elected, both from Lanka Sama Samaja Party. The percentage of women in parliament between the 1930s and the present has never exceeded 5%.
Women representation in LG elections
In this context, the present government has reserved 25% for women representation in the local government elections. The women all over the world demand equal rights. In the meantime, in our Constitution, Chapter 12 (1) and14 (1) G women have been sanctioned equal position. Unlike the previous governments, the present government is considering about women and their participation in politics and other core activities of the country. In this regard, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe plays a vital role in providing them with a due place in every sector. To give more emphasis on the women participation he has nominated Rosy Senanayake as a mayoral candidate to Colombo Municipal Council.
But there are still some practical problems which thwart womens involvement in politics. There is a tendency among Sri Lankans that women cannot involve in politics without the support and back up from men.
In practical Sri Lankan politics, women need a sort of bravery and boldness to contest and win the election. That era has been changed by the incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Moreover, the percentage of womens population is nearly 57% and their percentage of participation in politics is merely 5%. This is illogical and unfair thus the women should take more interest in politics because they can bring their problems to the limelight and obtain justice and solution for their problems.
It goes without saying that certain category of women in society hides and suppresses their problems because of the chauvinistic attitude of men and leads a life with a lot of grievances.
Contribution to economy
Women are innately kind and honest in their work and their contribution is significant to the economic growth and development of the country. Thats why the former President Chandrika Bandaranaike once quoted the Kenyan Bishop Ndimbes memorable words: Train a man, you train an individual, train a woman you build a nation. This is the same as saying that the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world. Although the government made compulsory every party and Independent group should include 25% women in their respective nomination list it will not bring real and realistic women participation unless/ until they make 25% in the selected members of the local government members.
This is also notable among the female Prime Ministers in the SAARC regions. Sheikh Hasina is the present Prime Minister of Bangladesh and in the past, Benazir Bhutto was the Prime Minister of Pakistan and Indira Gandhi was the Prime Minister of India. The female rulers show the real and active participation in the region. Besides, there are women in the world blessed with highest and responsible positions. There is always a discriminatory factor that always keeps women suppressed but now they have overcome all kinds of hurdles.
A classic example is Susanthika Jayasinghe who brought glory and credit to the country by winning a bronze medal in Olympic. She is one only woman athlete who won the medal in the history of the sport of Sri Lanka. One more rare achievement recently made by Jayathma Wickramanayake by being elected youth Secretary to the Secretary-General of United Nations Organisation. There is a possible way to increase the membership of women in the Local, Provincial and Parliamentary Government by prioritising the national list representations.
