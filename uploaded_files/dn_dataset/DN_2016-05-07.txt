Beck grabs first round lead at Yokohama Classic
LOS ANGELES, FRIDAY: Laetitia Beck fought off difficult windy conditions to card a seven-under 65 Thursday in the opening round of the LPGA Tour's Yokohama Classic.
Beck, who missed the cut in her previous three LPGA tournaments, took a two-stroke lead over American Annie Park and Australian Lee Min-Jee.
The first Israeli to qualify for the LPGA tour, Beck took the lead by completing a bogey-free round at the Prattville, Alabama course. She rolled in birdies on the fourth and fifth holes as well as at No. 16 and 17.
The conditions are great, she said. The greens are softer than what I played last year. They were softer so we can attack more. So I think that's why it's a scoreable course, especially because we can just go for it, especially with having short irons.
Beck finished with her lowest round of the season and took an opening round lead for the first time in her career. Her round also was one shy of her career best.
I think here on this golf course it's all putting because it's a very score-able course and hitting a lot of greens, hit the right part of the green and I think I was doing well making putts, even though I did miss birdie opportunities, Beck said.
But I made good putts for birdies and just kept going.
Park finished the round with birdies on five of the first seven holes but also double-bogeyed at No. 8. She also had birdies at No. 11 and 17 but bogeyed No. 15.
Alejandra Llaneza of Mexico shot four-under 68 for fourth while Morgan Pressel finished three-under 69, putting her in a three-way tie with Candie Kung and Vicky Hurst.
Michelle Wie shot a one-under 71 while defending champion Kris Tamulis finished at four-over 76.

Join us, deputy minister tells SLFP MPs in JO
The SLFP MPs in the Joint Opposition are not with the racist sections in it. We invite them to get back with the SLFP, Judiciary and Buddhasasana Deputy Minister Dushmantha Mithrapala said.
He was addressing the media at the Government Information Department Auditorium yesterday. Mithrapala said the Joint Opposition was cultivating racism freely.
Now all ethnicities are with the SLFP as the President is not a racist. Over 24 leaders from other ethnic groups participated in the SLFP's Galle May Day rally. This is the first time they participated in a SLFP May Day rally, he said.
"We will not let anybody break the SLFP," the deputy minister said.
Finance State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana said the country and the government will protect all leaders in the country and no leader will be discriminated when it comes to security.
The current President has the biggest threat as the LTTE tried to kill him on five occasions, he said.
Holding a May Day rally with Douglas Devananda does not mean that the President approves a federal state.
The President clearly rejected the idea of a federal state and dividing the country, he said.
Talking about the exchange of blows in Parliament and the vote on the Supplementary Appropriation Bill, he said when the media shows the people how their representatives behave in Parliament, the public will take a decision on them.
A well organised group which met in a house at Madiwela, waited for the 'correct time and stormed into Parliament and pick pocketed the vote on Supplementary Appropriation Bill. It is duty of all MPs to be in Parliament during the two weeks of each month and do their duty without wasting public money, Abeywardana said.

Some trying to make political capital out of MRs security issue
If any one tries to make political capital by raising an issue over the security of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa when the government has already guaranteed his security, it cannot he condoned at all, Liberal Party Leader Dr. Newton Peiris said.
If police personnel are deployed to replace the withdrawn Army personnel, there is no problem about security because it is crystal clear that no reduction of security has been made to the former President, he said. Addressing a press conference at Queens Hotel, Kandy on May 5, Dr Peiris said there is no Emergency declared in the country and terrorism had been totally eradicated.
Therefore, it was unfair on the part of the former President to ask for Army security which was denied to even the incumbent President and the Prime Minister, he added.
If former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had any problem with security he should discuss and settle this issue with President Maithripala Sirisena, but trying to create a violent situation over it could never be approved,Dr. Peiris said.
The Liberal Party Leader said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had been decisively defeated and rejected by the masses at the last Presidential Election and he should accept the decision taken by the people with humility.
He also said that there was a grave shortage of doctors in the country today and as such, the setting up of Private Medical Universities was no problem.
Liberal Party Vice President Dunstan de Silva, Treasurer Ratnasiri Kottage, Executive Committee member Ajith Prasanna and Tarindi Kahawita were also present on the occasion.

Over Rs. 400 m saved from Presidents Office expenditure
President Maithripala Sirisena has already made significant sacrifices and saved over Rs. 400 million from his office by cutting down expenditure from Rs. 800 million to Rs. 330 million. Therefore, following his practical example, the ministers also can save money without putting pressure on the people. A written request has been sent to the President proposing him to release a circular for Ministers in connection with cutting down their expenses, Finance State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana said.
Addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday, he said that in the letter to the President he has requested the President to intervene to cut down on many unnecessary expenses make by ministers. They should use the business class when traveling by air and not first class. All who travel abroad using state money should use economy class air tickets. They should use the cheapest rooms when stay abroad. They should limit their delegations and they should try to get the service of diplomats at Sri Lankan missions abroad.
According to the State Minister, the letter also requests the President to issue a circular limiting the number of foreign trips of Ministry Secretaries and other officials for only essential purposes. The Ministry Secretaries should formulate a system to educate all ministry officials on ministry expenses and fund management of the relevant ministry.
All Ministries should obtain vehicles on leasing. The Ministry Secretaries will not ignore these rules and regulations and they will violate those because nobody wish to go to various commissions and give statements or being questioned. If the President can save funds, the ministers should also do the same, he added.
