COLOMBO PORT to touch  7 MN TEU LANDMARK FOR 2018
The Colombo Port is on the brink of the 7 million TEU container throughput landmark for 2018.
We are almost there, which will also be the highest and best ever performance of the Colombo Port, an upbeat Chairman of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake told Daily News Business yesterday.
He expressed confidence that the landmark was within reach despite the head winds which usually prevail at this time of the year, which could have an impact on the docking of vessels in the Colombo Port.
He also said that one of the worlds largest shipping lines which patronizes the Colombo Port Maersk Lines which accounts for 20% of the business of the Colombo Port, had assured the Government that they would increase the volumes to Colombo on a year on year basis.
This assurance was provided to the Government when former Minister of Ports and Shipping Mahinda Samarasinghe and I paid a courtesy call on the A.P. Moller Maersk Lines Group Transport and Logistics CEO Soren Skouand it was he who provided us with that assurance, the SLPA Chief said.
Maersk is one of Sri Lankas biggest shipping clients and it was indeed important that we pay them these courtesy calls at the highest level.
This is also the second time in 15 years that a Sri Lankan Shipping Minister and I paid a courtesy call on Maersk since 2003, he explained.
They are fully committed to the Port of Colombo and they will undoubtedly keep increasing the volumes in and out of Colombo, he said.
This was a courtesy call to solicit their support and that was what we achieved, he said.
Dr. Dissanayake also said that the cause of the Colombo Port was further evidenced and buttressed by that it was adjudged as the fastest growing port in the world and even ahead of competing ports such as Singapore which was the second best, the ports of Dubai, Fujairah, Salalah in the Gulf and Tanjun Pelepas in Malaysia in the first half of 2018 and that was also due to head winds that affect all global ports and economies, he asserted.

Dont get public officers involved in political battle
MP Patali Champika Ranawaka recently threatened ministry secretaries that they would punish them for their failure to comply with the resolution passed by the Opposition suspending expenditure headings of certain ministries, UPFA Parliamentarian and Pivithuru Hela Urumaya leader Udaya Gammnapila said on Monday.
He attempted to instill fear in public officers. In a way, I am glad that he did not threaten that they would disappear like Ekneligoda, would be subject to electric shock treatments like Suki Thilakasiri, would be disabled forever like Sandeep or would be subject to thuggery like Marasinghe, Gammanpila said.
As we have repeatedly said, there is no legal basis for the so-called resolutions passed in Parliament in respect of suspending ministry expenditures. We can explain the legal basis. However, we cannot provide a brain for MP Ranawaka to understand the legal analysis, he said.
For the benefit of the public, I will explain the applicable law again. Ministries are provided with funds for 2018 in terms of Appropriation Act No 30 of 2017. If somebody wants to suspend the allocations, it can be done by bringing an amendment to this Act. It cannot be done with a motion.
Further, according to Article 152 of the Constitution, financial motions can only be brought by a minister with the approval of the Cabinet. Because of their ignorance, they have brought a financial motion being in the Opposition. They now blame the educated public officers for not following a motion which has no legal effect.

$500m WB loan for dairy, livestock
The World Bank (WB) approved a $500 million loan to help improve livestock and dairy production to meet the growing demand for egg, meat and milk and raise nutritional intakes of the Bangladeshis.
The assistance will improve agricultural productivity and market access of two million small household farmers and small and medium-scale agro-entrepreneurs, the WB said in a statement.
It is anticipated that by 2021 there will be annual shortages of 1.5 billion eggs, 0.5 million tonnes of meat and over 5.9 million tonnes of milk, it added.
Young children, pregnant women and new mothers are particularly vulnerable to nutritional shortfall.
The project aims to provide food safety information through training, mobile applications, and other multimedia tools.
Livestock development also has the potential to create more and better jobs for women, youth, and the vulnerable in rural areas, said Qimiao Fan, WB country director for Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal.
According to the global lender, the livestock sector employs 14 percent of the labour force while over 70 percent of rural households were also engaged.
Currently, 68 percent of the agricultural labour force comprises women, mainly involved in livestock and poultry production.
Climate change impacts on livestock production threaten to hamper the development of livestock, said Manievel Sene, WB team leader for a livestock and dairy development project.
Rural households livestock assets are highly exposed to risks, including loss of livestock, associated with natural events and major disease outbreaks, he said.
Mitigating risks by creating an enabling environment for livestock insurance will reduce the vulnerability of smallholder farmers as well as enhance productivity, he added.

Advantis aids Lady Ridgeway Hospital  with innovative space solutions
Advantis Engineering, a subsidiary of Hayleys Advantis Limited, recently completed the design, construction and furnishing of a lobby area for patients awaiting heart surgery at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children (LRH).
The team at Advantis Engineering, who have been working with the staff of LRH for many years, identified the need for a lobby that would help sooth a scared child who is on the way for a surgery.
The new lobby is furnished with comfortable seating, colorful walls, plenty of toys, a fish tank, and a TV to keep the children entertained and distracted whilst they await their surgery.
Commenting on the upgraded lobby Dr. Shehan Perera said, The newly gifted Cath-lobby is a fantastic addition to the hospital, especially to the kids who are undergoing heart catheter procedures and their parents at the Heart Centre at Lady Ridgeway Childrens hospital. In the past, children were lined up in a busy, noisy and crowded corridor, with no space to breathe ormove around. They were terrified at awaiting their turn to be taken for the procedure.
Now the Cath- Lobby provides them with a fairytale like space where they completely forget about the scary procedure that they are to undergo. The kids who come now do not want to leave the lobby because they feel so comfortable and happy in it.
Dr. Shehan Perera extended a very big thank you to the Advantis team for the wonderful gift of an out-of-this-world Cath-Lobby. He commented, Seeing the relieved faces of kids and their parents is an absolutely heartwarming experience, and any expression of gratitude from kids as well as parents for such a beautiful place is worth more than a thousand words.
This was the second phase of Advantis Engineerings ongoing work with LRH which began in 2016 when the company stepped forward to construct the storage area for the HOPE Operating Theater. This first phase of development, enabled the hospital to open up space for another operating theater which added to their capacity to save lives. Ultimately, this helped the hospital to perform two to three additional surgeries per day.
Commenting on the project, Kamal Wimalaratne, General Manager, Advantis Engineering, said, As a company that always puts the community first, we at Advantis Engineering are proud to be able to assist LRH in the great work they are doing through the use of our innovative space solutions. We hope that this new lobby with its enjoyable features will continue to create a better environment for the children preparing for treatment, and reduce the stress-levels of parents in the waiting room.
Founded in 1895 the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children is Sri Lankas premier pediatric hospital and is considered amongst the largest pediatric hospitals in the world with a bed-strength of over 900.
Advantis Engineering, a fully owned subsidiary of Hayleys Advantis Limited, constantly strives to provide innovative accommodation solutions for a wide variety of industries.

The monsoon rains in the Anuradhapura district was currently limited to few intermittent showers in several locations, irrigation officials said. Anuradhapura government Agent R.M. Wanninayake, referring to the 2018/19 Maha seasonal cultivation progress, said that the water levels of 3,000 tanks in Anuradhapura including the 13 major reservoirs, were at 75 percent capacity.
The capacities of the Rajanganaya and Padaviya tanks, Nuwara wewa, Hurulu wewa, Nachchaduwa and Whalkada tanks, Abaya wewa, as well as the Mahawilachchiya, Mahakanadarawa, Angamuwa, Thuruwila and Manankattiya tanks is 447,715 acre-feet; the current water levels in those tanks is 375,290 acre-feet, he said.
Wanninayake said that the water levels were satisfactory for the 2019 Yala cultivation as well. During the ongoing Maha season, around 325,000 acres have been used for paddy cultivation and a record 350,000 metric tonnes of paddy was expected, he added.
He said the water levels of the Kala wewa reservoir under the Mahaweli Development Authority was at 100,000 acre-feet, and that 50,000 acres of paddy fields were being cultivated with its water in the Mahaweli H zone.

Arvind Subramanian says Indian economy is in for a slowdown
Former chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian warned the Indian economy was in for a slowdown for some time as agriculture and financial system were under stress.
Speaking at the release of his book, Of Counsel: The Challenges of the Modi-Jaitley Economy, he said both demonetisation and implementation of GST have resulted in moderation of the economy and the budget estimate of revenue collection from the Goods and Services Tax (GST) seems to be unreasonable.
To judge the GST by what the budget demands of the GST, is unreasonable. I will say it frankly, the budget has made unreasonable demands on GST. It has asked for 16-17 per cent (increase), he said.
He also said that GST design could have been much better and there should not be more than three rates going forward.
The current rates are 28 per cent, 18 per cent, 12 per cent and 5 per cent.
With regard to the economy, he said, we have to brace ourself for a slowdown for some time. I say that for a combination of reasons. First of all, the financial system is under stress, financial conditions are very tight. This is not conducive for rapid growth.
The agriculture sector remains under stress, he said, adding international environment is getting much softer.
Europe is slowing down, Japan is slowing down...there are political calenders. It is easier to do things at some moments than other moments. I think to expect huge reforms that will perk up the economy at this stage would be somewhat ambitious.
For the combination of all these reasons I think we should brace ourselves for a period of slowdown. Then we have to see what policy actions are taken, how external environment changes, then we can think about real perk up in the economy, he said.
He also predicted that Universal Basic Income (UBI) would find space in the election manifestos of various parties next year.
Every major party manifesto will have some kind of universal basic income in it. I think it will happen, he remarked.
Many chief ministers have liked this idea not for populist reasons but for good reasons, he said, adding the UBI will help plug leakages.
He, however, said, If the Centre wants credit for this and it promises UBI on its own then fiscal space would be a serious issue.
Subramanian said that the autonomy of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) should not be undermined.
However, he said there were excess reserves with the RBI which can be utilised for the recapitalisation of public sector banks and not for funding the fiscal deficit of the government.
First, it can only be used for something say recapitalisation of banks and recapitalisation of banks only happen when there are reforms in the banking system in place, which the government should initiate. So it can be a nice cooperative bargain with the RBI.
Second, it cannot be a unilateral process, the RBI has to be a part of this. The government cannot do it alone. Third, any idea that this could be used to finance regular deficits or other expenditures, I would be totally against it. Because that would amount to a kind of raiding the RBI, he said.
Speaking about the revised GDP data released by Niti Aayog recently, he said the new series has created a lot of questions.
If you look at the other indicators during that period, you see a big difference between those indicators and the recent back-series. It demands an explanation.

Filing a motion in the Supreme Court, Attorney-at-law Aruna Laksiri said that President Maithripala Sirisenas alleged decision urging the Chief Justice to deliver judgment on the dissolution of Parliament without delay, was detrimental to the independence of the judiciary in the country.
The alleged decision taken by the President is detrimental to the countrys independent judiciary. I urge the Supreme Court to deliver the final judgment regarding Fundamental Rights petitions after perusing relevant facts presented before courts, Laksiri said.
He was of the view that the President could not make such a request since he did not file an application in terms of Article 129 of the Constitution.
He further said that the media had reported the fact that President Sirisena had made a request through the Attorney-General, urging the Chief Justice to deliver judgment on the dissolution of Parliament without delay.
Aruna Laksiri is one of the petitioners who filed a Fundamental Rights petition challenging the dissolution of Parliament.
He also filed an application in the Supreme Court on Monday, requesting that a charge sheet be filed against Speaker Karu Jayasuriya for contempt of court in terms of Article 105 (3) of the Constitution.

Big data, data analytics vital for work efficacy - Peter Carey
To keep up with the ever-changing technological advancements in the world, accounting professionals need to utilise big data, data analytics in improving the efficacy of their work.
Emerging technologies such Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain today are likely to reshape many aspects of accountancy profession and at the same time, the relevance of the role of accountants in the financial markets is more important than ever before. Hence it is essential to incorporate or respond to these technologies as they become significant, said Peter Carey, Head of Accounting, Deakin University- Australia at the 15th graduation ceremony of Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka (CMA), held in Colombo yesterday.
If you dont do that, you will risk losing your relevance in market place, he said. He also noted that professional accountants must maintain integrity, transparency and independence to serve the public interest by delivering more insights and value to the users of the financial information and statements.
Technical competence is also important and critical for accountants. Hence it is essential to focus on developing technical competency of accountants. A creative person is someone who can look at a problem and find a unique way to solve that problem. He or she should be creative and innovative in dealing with day to day problems, thats the real creativity. Accountants also need to be vigilant and constantly enhance their own creativity to address problems in day to day work, Carey noted.
Chief Guest of the event, Bryce Hutchesson- Australian High Commissioner in Sri Lanka speaking at the event noted that in Sri Lanka and Australia, management accountants are recognized and respected for the key role they play in government and private sector in enabling good governance, focused expenditure and strategic decision making. He said Sri Lanka has immense potential to grow, for that he noted that Sri Lanka needs highly talented, bright young professionals to realise the goals of countrys development agenda. Furthermore, he reiterated the Australian governments willingness to provide fullest support to realise the goals of economic agenda of Sri Lankan government.
President of CMA, Prof. Lakshman R Watawala delivering the welcome address at the event said it is essential to further develop knowledge and skills of accountants to ensure that their client or the employer receives a competent professional service based on current developments. Professional accountants should be straight forward and honest in their professional and business relationships, Prof. Watawala stressed.
Speaking on new reporting concepts in annual reports, he said that integrated reporting brings together the material information about an organizations strategy, governance, performance and prospects in a way that reflects the commercial, social and environmental context within which it operates. It provides a clear and concise representation of how an organization demonstrates stewardship and how it creates value, now and in the future.
Today we find very large reports. But no one reads them. But integrated reports put everything in a condensed format so that any shareholder will be able to read it. Prof. Watawala said.
He also said that two decades ago, global accountancy professionals including auditors and professional accountants as well as governments and businesses have supported the fight against bribery.

Ceylinco Life donates new classroom buildings to schools
Ceylinco Life helped move students from temporary shelters to purpose-built classrooms when it donated buildings to four rural schools in four districts in a single week at the end of November, stepping up the pace of one of the Companys principal community initiatives.
The Welideniya Kanishta Vidyalaya in Wanduramba Galle District, the Kirinda Vidyalaya, Nikaweratiya Kurunegala District, the Hulandawa Dakuna Maha Vidyalaya in Hulandawa (Moneragala District) and the Konketiyawa Vidyalaya, Bogahawewa Anuradhapura District were the recipients of the 71st, 72nd, 73rd and 74th school buildings donated by Ceylinco Life under this program.
The first of this latest batch of beneficiary schools, the Welideniya Kanishta Vidyalaya, has 270 students and 15 teachers and had converted its library into a classroom due to a shortage of buildings that had compelled several classes to be accommodated in temporary shelters. The classroom built by Ceylinco Life will be used by the students of Grade 11.
The 60 year old Kirinda Vidyalaya, with 310 students and 20 teachers had been in the same plight, with several classes being housed in unsafe temporary shelters. Nevertheless, the school has achieved a 75 per cent pass rate at the GCE (Ordinary Level) examination and sent some of its students to all-island sporting events. The new classroom donated by Ceylinco Life has been earmarked for students of Grade 5 of this remote school.
Although its students had achieved the best results in the Uva province at the GCE Ordinary Level examination of 2015, the Hulandawa Dakuna Maha Vidyalaya (302 students, 29 teachers) had also faced space constraints and converted the school hall to classrooms when Ceylinco Life stepped into help with a new building that will accommodate the schools dance classes.
The final beneficiary school, Konketiyawa Vidyalayahad several temporary shelters with mud flooring, wooden poles and tin roofs for classrooms. Students of Grade 2 of the school, which has 221 students and eight teachers, will move in to a new purpose-built classroom donated by Ceylinco Life when the new school year begins.
Commenting on Ceylinco Lifes schools infrastructure programme, the Companys Managing Director and CEO Thushara Ranasinghe said: Education has always been a primary focus in our community efforts, and we have been building classrooms around the country for the past 14 years. In many areas, students undergo extraordinary hardships due to the lack of facilities. We consider it our duty to help create a more conducive environment for children to study even under challenging circumstances and conditions.
The opening ceremonies for the four classrooms donated by the Company in the last week of November were conducted with much enthusiasm by parents, teachers and students of the respective schools.
Commencing with a classroom built for the Tissa Primary School in Lunugamvehera in 2004, Ceylinco Lifes schools infrastructure project has traversed the length and breadth of Sri Lanka, assisting schools in diverse locations such as Jaffna, Vavuniya, Trincomalee, Mutur, Batticaloa, Sittandy, Mollipatana, Ayithyamalai, Embilipitiya, Nivitigala, Beligala, Avissawella, Deniyaya, Kamburupitiya, Bandarawela, Haputale, Rambukkana, Kandy, Pilimatalawa, Madulkele, Rikillagaskada, Rajawella, Matale, Galgamuwa, Padaviya, Boraluwewa, Anuradhapura, Moneragala, Anamaduwa, Matugama, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Wellawaya and Talawa and Chilaw.

Germany opposes excluding suppliers  from planned 5G networks



Germany opposes excluding any manufacturers and technologies from its planned construction of 5G mobile networks, a spokesman for the interior ministry said, sounding a note of support for Chinese suppliers led by Huawei Technologies.
U.S. allies such as Australia, New Zealand and Japan have restricted Huaweis access to their markets and the companys chief financial officer has been arrested in Canada facing possible extradition to the United States.
We dont foresee the legal exclusion of specific suppliers or specific products, the spokesman told a regular government news conference on Friday, restating Berlins existing position.
We are of the view that the security and privacy of the network infrastructure that is deployed should be ensured.
Meng Wanzhou, Huaweis CFO and daughter of its founder, was arrested on Dec. 1 in connection with a U.S. investigation into an alleged scheme to use the global banking system to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran.
Earlier, U.S. officials had lobbied allies regarding the need to shut Chinese suppliers out of their networks citing the risk that Beijings intelligence services could obtain covert access through so-called backdoors.
Germany has debated the issue, but the countrys telecoms industry has defended its longstanding relationship with Huawei. Market leader Deutsche Telekom runs a 5G project in Berlin with the Shenzhen-based market leader.
Germanys network regulator has set the ball rolling to auction 5G mobile licences, with a deadline for submissions set for Jan. 25. The auctions should take place in early 2019.

GMOA urges President to suspend all FTA plans
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) yesterday asked former Minister Patali Champaka Ranawaka as to why he failed to bring former Development Strategies and International Trade Ministry Secretary Chandani Wijewardene before the Parliament Privilege Committee for drafting the Singapore - Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA).
Dr. Nalinda Herath of the GMOA said that parliamentarian Ranawaka, who is pretending to be patriotic, had failed to bring former Ministry Secretary and other officials in the Ministry for drafting an agreement which is detrimental to the country.
Parliamentarian Ranawaka is reportedly planning to bring Ministry Secretaries before the Parliament Privilege Committee for their decision during this period, he said, adding that the SLSFTA had betrayed the country and an environment was created for foreigners to exploit national assets.
Government Medical Officers Association Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge urged the President to immediately suspend the previous governments plans to forge trade agreements with other countries in the region, considering the recommendations of the Expert Committee Report on the SLSFTA.
He said that striking bilateral trade deals without having a proper national trade policy was harmful to the country, and that the previous governments plant to have agreements with Indonesia and Thailand should be suspended.
He added that the country needed a national trade policy and that priority should be given for the formulation of this national policy by the President.
He said that the World Trade Organisation had also recommended that Sri Lanka should have a national trade policy
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Office in Colombo, Dr. Aluthge said that President Maithripala Sirisena gave them an assurance that he would not sign any agreement betraying the countrys independence and sovereignty.
Former Minister Malik Samarawickrama was so powerful that he was able to sign this agreement disregarding the Presidents vision, he said
The SLSFTA is more detrimental to the country than the Kandyan Convention in 1815 signed between the Kandyan chiefs and British colonials.

Govt. expenses to be met through special provision - Yapa
Due to the absence of an Appropriation Bill, the government may decide to raise loans in Sri Lanka or from overseas to meet the countrys operational expenditures through a special provision for loans under an Act of Parliament.
UPFA MP Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said that the country would have to face a crisis if it does not raise enough funds before the new financial year.
We have no desire to either burden the public, avenge them, or strip them of their salaries, pensions and Samurdhi benefits. Due to the absence of a budget, we may decide to borrow under this special provision to meet the countrys operational requirements, he said.
Under the Loans (Special Provisions) Act (No. 40 of 1982), the government has the authority to raise loans for the service of the government during any period commencing on the first day of the financial year.
According to the Act, this is possible if there are no appropriation acts passed by Parliament at such time. Based on the text of the Act, it cites that without prejudice to any other law authorising the raising of loans for and on behalf of the government, any expenditure of the government, for which provision has been made by, or lawfully authoritised, for any period commencing on the first day of any financial year of which no Appropriation Act has been passed by Parliament and ending on the date of commencement of the Appropriation Act for that financial year, may be met from the proceeds of loans which are hereby authorized to be raised, whether in or outside Sri Lanka.
Yapa said the aggregate of the loan raised in any of these three months will not exceed one-fourth of the total amount of loans authorised to be raised for the preceding financial year. He said loans can be raised to meet the countrys expenditure or provide for matters connected or incidental.

Hold referendum, if dissolution case is lost - Dr. Amarasekara
Federation of National Organisations Convener Dr.Gunadasa Amarasekara called on President Maithripala Sirisena to hold a referendum if the Supreme Court rules against the dissolution of Parliament.
Addressing a press conference in Rajagiriya, Dr.Amarasekara said referring the matter to the people would be wiser than referring it to the SC judges.
He argued that the President has the powers to call for a referendum to seek public opinion on any matter which has national importance.
He recalled how the people in the UK voted in favour of Brexit at a referendum when authorities hesitated to take that decision.
I am not an expert on the law, but I am of the opinion that the Presidents decision was Constitutional. During Local Government polls in February, the people clearly rejected the Government which then prevailed, he commented.
Dr.Amarasekara said the 19th Amendment to the Constitution must be immediately done away with. Even though 1978 Constitution contained excessive executive powers, there were no overlapping provisions.The 19th Amendment is overwhelmed with overlapping provisions and is only good for lawyers to continue arguing. We need a new Constitution, he added.
Dr.Amarasekara commenting on the Presidents recent remark that the current crisis is an outcome of a clash between local thinking and anti-national thinking, said that he is happy that the President has grown wisdom at least now.
Dr.Wasantha Bandara said the President should immediately declare a General Election if the SC ruling was in favour of his decision and if not he must call for a referendum. He asked the President to get all nationalist forces together to make a broader alliance to contest for the elections and to protect the unity between the President and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Japanese STEM group robotics at 19+ Vocational, Career Trade Exhibition
The Ministry of Education in Sri Lanka organized the 19+, Educational, Vocational, Career guidance and Trade exhibition 2018 recently at the Kuliyapititya Central College.
This exhibition was specifically targeted towards students of grade 9 and above but was open to all. A dedicated Japanese STEM group lead by Renaya Kikuchi of SCCIP Japan attended to provide invaluable insights into Robotics, STEM related technologies and teaching techniques.
SCCIP has been providing STEM educational know how for the last 20 years and as of October 2018, has successfully deployed its services to over 50 schools in India, and 16 schools in Thailand. It is engaged in over 22 after-school classroom programs in Japan and 26 in the United States of America. A characteristic attribute of SCCIP is its emphasis on Hands-on authentic learning, project based learning and context based learning methods.
The SCCIP stall and its workshop on Robotics and STEM has been well received by the public and witnessed the attendance of a large number of students. Upon completion of the workshop the student received an internationally recognized certificate offered by SCCIP.
This was a rare and valuable opportunity for Sri Lankan students to obtain an internationally recognized certificate at no cost.
STEM emphasizes the practical applications of its individual elements through critical and analytical thinking, problem solving and innovative thinking.
Sri Lankas Science and technological sector is in dire need. Our country is currently ranked 88 on the Global Innovation Index and the GDP share for the industry sector has only increased by 3.9% from 2010 to 2018. This is a worrying situation as 60% of the Global job market is expected to be comprised of STEM related jobs by 2030.
To face this reality and the entire education system of our country needs to be rethought, revaluated and completely overhauled.

WHO Representative Dr. Olivia Nieveras said the WHO selected Sri Lanka to hold the World Health Day this year in recognition of the significant health achievements in Sri Lanka.
The social investments such as female education in Sri Lanka has helped the country to achieve good health outcome, she said.
Sri Lanka has achieved a good progress in controlling Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), mother and child care, but need to be focused on rapidly aging population. Sri Lanka has one of the fasted aging populations in the world, she added.
A total of 20.8 percent of the Sri Lankan population will be over 60 by 2031, National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) Chairman Dr. Palitha Abeykoon said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) Auditorium in Colombo yesterday he said that by 2031, the percentage of below 20 population in Sri Lanka will be 25.8 percent. Around 90 percent of health expenses occur in human life during the last two to five years. At the moment Sri Lankan people spend around 40 to 45 percent of their health expenses out of pocket.
According to Dr. Abeykoon, the out of pocket health expenses of a country should be reduced below 25 percent. Only Thailand and Bhutan in the region has achieved this target and the out of pocket expenses for health in those two countries are around 25 percent. Health coverage should reach the poorest and the most vulnerable population. Full range of essential services should be made available to the people.

Macron promises wage rise to defuse crisis
FRANCE: Embattled French President Emmanuel Macron Monday announced a series of financial measures, including a minimum wage rise and tax concessions seeking to defuse the yellow vest revolt that has triggered violent protests in cities across the country.
In a 15-minute televised speech from the Elysee Palace, a sombre-looking President told the nation, I accept my share of responsibility for the crisis.
The former investment banker struck a more humble tone than usual as he sought to address criticism of his style of leadership.
I know that I have hurt some of you with my statements, he said.
Macron stressed, however, that the protests by mostly low-income people in small town or rural France were the result of long-term problems.
Their distress doesnt date from yesterday. We have ended up getting used to it, he said.
These are forty years of malaise that have come to the surface. Among the measures Macron announced was a 100 euro ($113) monthly increase in the minimum wage as of next year, for which businesses would not have to foot the bill.
The minimum wage was set at 1,498 euros a month pre-tax in 2018 and 1,185 euros after tax.The minimum wage would increase by 100 per month from 2019, he said.
Macrons government had previously suggested that any increase in the minimum wage would destroy jobs rather than help create them.
But the protests, which have seen rioting in Paris and other cities and taken a heavy financial toll, are the biggest challenge for Macron since he came to power in May 2017 promising to revitalise the economy.
Since then his popularity has fallen with critics saying he favours the rich and alienates people struggling, especially in provincial France.
The 40-year-old centrist also announced he would roll back most of an unpopular increase in taxes on pensioners introduced by his government. Macron, who has been in power for the past 18 months, on Monday held four hours of crisis talks with government ministers, parliamentary leaders, business and labour representatives and regional officials.
He had previously vowed that unlike his predecessors he would not be swayed by street protests.
But in an initial attempt to quell the revolt now in its fourth week, the government agreed last week to cancel a planned increase in anti-pollution fuel taxes -- the spark behind the yellow vest protests in car-dependent rural and suburban France.
But the move was seen as too little, too late by the protesters, who held a fourth round of demonstrations on Saturday to press for further concessions on reducing inequality.
The campaign of nationwide road blockades and weekend protests in Paris and other cities over four consecutive weekends, which degenerated into destruction and looting, have taken a toll on the French economy.
Nationwide an estimated 136,000 people turned out for the protests last weekend -- the same number as a week earlier.
Since the start of the protests, more than 4,500 people have been detained, police said. Reactions to his speech from the yellow vests were hard to judge as the movement is leaderless and has refused to come under the sway of political parties or trade unions.
Some protesters, interviewed on French television, acknowledged that Macron had made some concessions, but added that these were insufficient to call the protests off.
This time, there really is some progress. My smile got bigger and bigger as he spoke, said Erwan, one of the movements spokesmen in the northwestern town of Rennes.
But, for Pierre-Gael Laveder, in the eastern town of Montceau-les-Mines, Macron hasnt taken the full measure of what is going on.
Everyone of his announcements was booed and the first overall reaction was he thinks we are fools, Laveder added.
Right-wing opposition leader Marine Le Pen, Macrons rival in last years presidential run-off election, welcomed some of the tax measures announced, but accused Macron of being the harbinger of savage globalisation. - AFP

Microsoft launches Future Ready Program
As part of its ongoing efforts to close the digital skills gap, Microsoft has kicked off Future Ready, a program run in partnership with non-profits and schools to generate interest amongst students to learn computer science and empower teachers with skills to teach computer science.
The company is committed to helping students learn computer science to unlock future economic opportunities. By embracing computational thinking, students acquire fundamental skills for the 21st century such as creativity and problem-solving.
To close this skills gap, students need teachers who understand the value of computer science and are trained on delivering high-quality and inclusive curricula, something which most students in Asia-Pacific desire. According to the STEM Education in Asia Pacific survey commissioned by Amgen and the Global STEM Alliance, 93% of Asia-Pacific students like Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)-related subjects, but fewer than 50% say they are receiving the STEM resources they need.
In Sri Lanka, Santhusha Jayathilake, a teacher and an Ambassador for micro:bit SLUG, set up a coding center to help shift parents and other teachers perception on STEM education. He has conducted coding workshops using micro:bit for students across Sri Lanka and is now advising schools on introducing computer science in the classroom. His students, meanwhile, get hands-on practice with location-specific challenges.
I use the micro-bit, a pocket-sized computer that students can code to solve real-world problems, with simple visual programming, he says. When my students coded an earthquake warning system, I could see how they improved their critical thinking.
Together with nonprofit partners, Microsoft will help teachers co-create and leverage curricula that is inclusive, culturally relevant and gender-responsive, to benefit youth who may be underrepresented in computer science education such as young women, youth with special needs, and those living in rural areas or indigenous communities.
Underpinning its commitment even further, Microsoft will also provide cash grants and technologies to build the capacity of nonprofits to teach high-quality computer science education to underserved youth via its digital skills program.

Norway, Canada, Germany continues to violate Vienna Convention, says Intl Law Professor
The heads of the Canadian High Commission, the Norwegian and German embassies in Colombo are directly violating the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, a former judicial officer of the European Court of Law yesterday pointed out,judicial officer and Law Professor Dinesh K Gunasekera said.
The heads of missions from these sending States have acted in a manner ignoring their obligations under the Vienna Convention not to interfere in the domestic affairs of the receiving country. Some diplomatic agents were seen hooting in the Sri Lankas Parliament recently, he said.
Prof. Gunasekera said the first such instance related to the Canadian High Commissioner violating the Vienna Convention was he started tweeting about MP Namal Rajapaksas doings.
The Canadian High Commission has run the gamut of violating the diplomatic relations by criticizing a statement made by the President of Sri Lanka to its nation, he explained.
This diplomatic agent did not stop there, he said, He had taken the liberty to visit a mass grave in a formerly terrorist held area and acted in the most unfitting way to a diplomat.
The heads of German and Norwegian mission in Sri Lanka acted in a similar fashion, he said.
However, some countries like France did not act like this interfering in the internal matters of the country, Law Prof. Gunasekerasaid said.
He asked why that Sri Lankas Foreign Secretaries do not seem to call those diplomats for questioning.
I do not know whether theses diplomats were ignoring their duties as the heads of diplomatic mission to their receiving states because they had thought of this country as a colony that they once controlled he asked.
This should not be tolerated and allowed as the previous government under Ranil Wickremesinghe has allowed, he said.
Ranil Wickremesinghes habit of running into foreign embassies to speak out his predicament whenever there is a problem, has created this climate of vulnerability to other nations, Prof. Gunasekera said.
A sovereign nation is expected to act against the diplomats who violate the Vienna Convention, he stressed.

Oceanfront Condos launched in Galle
Building on the success of Nilaveli, ICC has chosed Galle, the largest city on the southern coast, and the center of beach tourism in Sri Lanka for the second development Oceanfront Condos.
Enter through classically styledarchway, designed to celebrate the architecture of Galle, and step into the courtyard which features the secluded pool. Walk down to the beach or head into the apartment which features double height views of the ocean from the living rooms. International Construction Consortium brings reliability and peace of mind to your weekend getaway home.
The largest city on the southern coast of Sri Lanka, strategically located for maritime operations, and once a stronghold of the western colonial powers, Galle is now the epicenter of beach tourism in Sri Lanka.
The era of making Galle a road trip is over. Gone are the days of being stuck in traffic from beach town to beach town, dodging high speed intercity buses and cursing at tuktuks. Hop on the Southern Expressway and wiz past lush fields of paddy and rubber plantations, before you know it youre in Galle. For those who reminisce a tea stop at the Monis bakery, fear not, they have found their way to the rest stop.
Galle seems to find a calling for everyone. Drive through the arches of the fort and youll realize you have left the 21st century behind.

Petition challenges Ranils MP ship
A writ petition was yesterday filed in the Court of Appeal seeking an order in the nature of a writ of quo warranto declaring that UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe be disqualified to be a Member of Parliament.
This petition was filed by Sharmila Roweena Jayawardene Gonawela, a member of the Colombo Municipal Council representing Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna.
Gonawela cited UNP General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Secretary General of Parliament Dhammika Dassanayake, the Bank of Ceylon and Peoples Bank as respondents.
The petitioner alleged that first Respondent Ranil Wickremesinghe held, as at the time of the Parliamentary Elections held on August 17, 2015, a financial interest in several contracts entered into by public corporations on behalf of the Republic of Sri Lanka with his family company Lake House Printers and Publishers PLC, by virtue of his having been a major shareholder of the said company.
The petitioner stated that first respondent Ranil Wickremesinghe has been declared elected as a Member of Parliament from Colombo District at the Elections held in 2015, and to sit and vote in Parliament. The Petitioner states that the first Respondents election was illegal for the reasons set out below and is thus an usurper of the authority of a Member of Parliament and is not qualified to hold the office of an MP.
The Petitioner states that Article 91(1)(e) of the Constitution of the Republic bars individuals who hold any interest in public contracts from being elected as a Member of Parliament.
The Petitioner states that as held in Dilan Perera vs Rajitha Senaratne(2000 (2) SLR 79),that under prevailing law, Article 91(1)(e) of the Constitution disqualifies a person to be elected as a Member of Parliament or to sit and vote in Parliament if he, directly or indirectly by himself or by any person on his behalf or for his use or benefit, holds, or enjoys any right or benefit under any contract made by or on behalf of the (Republic of Sri Lanka) in respect of the Government of the Island for the furnishing or providing of money to be remitted abroad or of goods or services to be used or employed in the service of the (Republic of Sri Lanka) in the Island.
The Petitioner states that came across a cheque drawn on an account at the Bank of Ceylon. On the said cheque leaf, the petitioner noted the words Lake House Printers and Publishers PLC Tel:2302139 printed vertically in small-point sans-serif typeface, implying that the cheque book from which the cheque was written was printed by the said Lake House Printers and Publishers PLC.The petitioner observed that the identical print was printed in cheque issued by the Peoples Bank.
The Petitioner recalled that the first Respondent who for the past twenty-four years has been the Leader of the said UNP, was a shareholder in a group of companies carrying the, Lake House Printers and Publishers PLC. As an Activist in Social and Political activities, the Petitioner was aware that any interest in the business of cheque printing for public banks by a company owned by the first Respondent and his family would disqualify the first Respondent from being elected as a Member of Parliament.
The first Respondent is described as a Major shareholder of Lake House Printers and Publishers PLC, in its Annual Reports issued for the years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, each of which describe him as the ninth largest shareholder of the company, holding 38,964 shares of the company or 1.33% of the total outstanding shares, the petitioner said.
She further said over 90% of the remaining shares of Lake House Printers and Publishers PLC are held in the name of close kin of the first Respondent Ranil Wickremesinghe.

trade union action in tea plantations
RPCs claim colossal losses
Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) are losing over Rs. 200 million per day and a collective loss per month of Rs. 6.25 billion due to the ongoing trade union action in tea plantations, said Planters Association Ceylon spokesman, Roshan Rajadurai.
Rajadurai said that while the trade unions are demanding a minimum wage of Rs. 1,000 per day RPCs were proposing a Revenue Based model where the tea plucker could earn more. We propose Rs. 46 per kilo which would make the worker more active and in turn would help to increase productivity.
Currently over 1,500 are working in RPCs and there are 1.5 million dependents.
It was also pointed out that in contrast to Sri Lanka, tea pluckers in Assam India are paid Rs. 350 and they pluck more than local pluckers. He explained that the industry would collapse if RPCs were forced to pay the wages proposed by the unions. The 20% increase demanded by union would cost the RPCs Rs. six billion each year and another Rs. three billion in gratuity payments and the total impact would be Rs. nine billion a year.
Global tea prices too have taken a dip and the US Dollar appreciation too has not helped RPCs. In addition due to the Glyphosate fertilizer ban and due to other high production costs, Sri Lanka is now losing its competitive edge to both India and Kenya in the global tea market. Worker migration too is an issue.
He said that the issue has been going on for some time where they do not see a Silver Lining soon. Currently we are only seeing stars! he quipped.
He said that the creation of RPCs several decades ago has helped the government to save a lot of money, as the government was spending around Rs. 400 million per month to up keep tea plantation industry before privatization.
He also appealed form the government to provide adequate security to RPC officials as they face issues.

Carbon Efficiency points (EPs) of SriLankan Airlines declined to 55.6 points in 2018 from 56 points in 2017 according to the atmosfair Airline Index which ranks and compares the carbon efficiency of the 200 largest airlines of the world.
The British TUI Airways was placed first in the ranking as in the previous year, reaching under 80% of the feasible optimum of low CO2 emissions. Fourth place went to its German counterpart TUIFly. The German airline has consistently been at the top in the atmosfair ranking since 2012. With Condor another German holiday flier made it into the top 10 (72 out of 100 efficiency points).
This tool enables passengers to compare airlines offering flights to particular destinations and choose the airline that produces the least CO2 emissions.
The formula contain for every flight the aircraft type, engines, winglets, seating and freight capacity as well as load factors for both passengers and co-loaded freight.
Carbon emissions from airlines grew by about 5% last year, while the number of kilometres flown increased by 6%, according to atmosfair, showing that much more needs to be done to ensure aviation does not take up an unsustainable amount of the worlds remaining carbon budget.

Investigation into attempts at bribing MPs :
TISL urges CIABOC to consider Presidents statement
Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) called on the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), to consider President Maithripala Sirisenas statement in its ongoing investigation into allegations of attempts to bribe parliamentarians.
The Presidents acknowledgement in an interview with the Daily Mirror last week, that money had been solicited and offered to MPs in exchange for their allegiance, underscores the importance of a comprehensive and timely investigation by CIABOC. TISL has formally provided the recording of the Presidents statement to CIABOC.
On November 28, TISL provided a detailed statement to CIABOC pursuant to a complaint regarding alleged attempts to bribe MPs, highlighting that the contents of telephone conversation recordings shared with the media recently by MP Palitha Range Bandara, clearly indicate an offence under Section 14 of the Bribery Act.
Speaking on the most recent development, TISL Executive Director Asoka Obeyesekere said, The remarks made by the President during this interview give weight to the initial complaint filed by TISL. Whilst the President states that he will never support the bribing of politicians, he acknowledges personal knowledge of bribes being demanded, which is indicative of a potential pattern of criminal activity involving politicians and clandestine political intermediaries.
TISL calls on the President to voluntarily provide a statement to CIABOC, thereby upholding his own commitment to transparency and accountability. Furthermore, during the interview, the President also alleged that attempts were made in the past to undermine investigations undertaken by Commissions of Inquiry.
If such an obstruction has occurred, the President, as the appointing authority of these Commissions of Inquiry, must inform law enforcement agencies; for them to investigate and take the necessary steps to ensure the integrity of the Commissions, Obeyesekere added.

US envoy called upon to exercise diligence - Cabraal
The comments made by new American Ambassador Alaina B. Teplitz that Sri Lankas economy is in bad shape after October 26, is erroneous and damaging, said former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal.
He hoped that the foreign mission will be magnanimous enough to correct their statements. I dont think its a fair comment to make.The new ambassador does not know much. They should have had the care and foresight to refer to previous reports that also emanated in the country in this respect. If they had done so with due diligence, if they had done their homework they would have noticed that this complex situation did not arise overnight, Cabraal said.
He said that the economy had been deteriorating over four years and that this was not a sudden development.Neither did it arise from the political crisis. He added many people including himself had articulated this position and foresaw the economic crisis that the country was heading into but no measures were taken at the time to address those issues.
It is unfair to mention that it was sudden, it was in the offing. I hope the US Embassy will take steps to correct their own version, comments like these can have a tremendous damage to the countrys forward march, he said. US is a friend and friends must take due care that other friends economies are not hindered by these comments. If they carry out due diligence, they would see that those comments were erroneous. Hope they will be magnanimous and conscientious enough to understand and make that correction.
UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena said the Ambassador had made erroneous comments blaming the economic crisis on the political crisis, after her visit to the pay respect to the Mahanayake thero.
We value the respect the new ambassador has for keeping to cultural norms by visiting the Mahanayake theras, but we wish to point out that the comments she made to the media about the economy is inaccurate and uncalled for, he said.
He added that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa took over the Premiership knowing very well that the economy was already in dire straits. We knew the economy was collapsing, we had predicted this many months ago.
We said that the economy was crumbling and that the Rupee was depreciating, he said adding that the former president took it over to help revive, support and promote Sri Lankas primary industries and businesses.

Waiting for Judgement Day
There is a clamour from several quarters within the political spectrum and outside for the Supreme Court to deliver its verdict on the dissolution of Parliament without delay. These individuals and groups rightly claim that any delay on the part of the SC to pronounce judgement would place the country in further jeopardy. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has taken the lead in calling for a speedy judgement from the Supreme Court in order to resolve the stalemate now entering its second month.
Party Spokesman and Senior SLFP member Nimal Siripala de Silva, addressing the media said; We know the Supreme Court has challenges, but we expect the decision will come soon as it is essential to get the country back to normal. He also said that President Maithripala Sirisena is on record stating that he would accept whatever verdict handed down by the Supreme Court and would act accordingly.
The President too is keen for an early judgement and was due to communicate his intention to the Attorney General yesterday for this to be apprised to the Court. In addition, an organisation named Yatharthaya (Reality) which is collective of a group of clergy representing all religions too has called upon the Supreme Court not to delay the judgement considering the consequences on the country.
Its General Secretary the Ven.Kiri-Ibbanaare Vijitha Thera said: The masses of this country, the Maha Sangha, the members of the Christian order, Hindu and Muslim priests and political leaders are waiting in expectation of obtaining a verdict from the Supreme Court about the Presidents dissolution of Parliament, within the course of this week (the Court vacations is due to begin on the 14th).
The Presidents concern in this regard is understandable. He had already promised the nation that he would end the crisis within one week. Yesterday marked the end of that period with no solution forthcoming. The country is, in the meantime, drifting aimlessly with the State machinery virtually in a state of paralysis. It was reported in the media that Secretaries of Ministries have stopped releasing money for Ministers which means that work in these ministries has come to a standstill. Things can only get worse with the Supreme Court putting off hearing the Writ case calling into question the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister and the Cabinet, until January 7. Adding to the confusion, the Speaker had summoned the Secretary to the Prime Minister and others over their alleged failure to comply with the Parliament motion suspending all expenditure to ministries. In any case there will be no funds to run the State after January 01, in the absence of a budget and even a Vote on Account is contingent on the Supreme Court ruling in favour of the dissolution.
Perhaps, the President had factored in all these obstacles in wanting a speedy verdict from the Supreme Court, for the country cannot remain in a state of limbo indefinitely. The Political temperature is bound to rise in the coming days creating further chaos. The UNP is planning a mass rally at Galle Face on the 17th while the SLFP/UPFA/SLPP combine too is talking about counter events.
The unrest is bound to dovetail into Christmas signalling a somewhat bleak yuletide for Christians. His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith when questioned about such a possibility said he too was awaiting the Court verdict before deciding on the next move. Perhaps, the Most Ven. Mahanayake Theras, the Heads of Anglican Church and leaders of other faiths should combine to work a way out of the impasse. This was very much in evidence during the tsunami tragedy that hit the country exactly 14 years ago where not only members of the clergy of all religions but also politicians belonging to all parties rallied together at a time of grave peril in a rare show of unity.
What is on display at present is as grave, if not worse, than the giant Boxing-Day tidal wave that would require the efforts of all parties to subdue. It is hoped that the warring parties, even at this late hour, will put behind them their bitter feuding and reach a consensus on resolving the current imbroglio. In both camps there are mature politicians with long experience in the field who could come forward rising above petty differences to resolve what is certainly the gravest crisis to hit the country since independence. After all, they owe the people that much.
Both sides should stop their grandstanding and think about the harm caused to the country. Vituperative language that has been the stock in trade of Lankan politics since independence should be toned down. The political debate should be centred on finding a way out of the present impasse. Already the economy is taking a severe beating, with the massive flight of foreign capital and the runaway depreciation of the Rupee against the US Dollar. With no Finance Minister following the Interim Order restraining the functioning of ministers, things could only go from bad to worse. This is another reason why a speedy solution matters.

Kurunegala-Habarana new railway line:
Work to commence next year
Preliminary work on the Kurunegala-Habarana new railway line continues and the work will commence in 2020, sources said.
Project Director V.Amarathunga told Daily News that the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB) has completed the pre-feasibility study of the project and the preliminary survey of the rail track was completed up to Dambulla by the Survey Department now. He said the land acquisition is carried out in the Kurunegala and the Mallawapitiya Divisional Secretariats.
The length of the track from Kurunegala to Habarana via Dambulla is 86 kilometres. An additional double track of four kilometres runs to the Dambulla Economic Centre. Six main stations lie at Ibbagamuwa, Melsiripura, Galewala,Dambulla, Sigiriya ( Inamaluwa) and Habarana with sub-stations at Thorayaya, Gokarella, Thalkiriyagma and Digampathana, he said.
Three tunnels will be constructed at Ibbagamuwa, Polgolla and Omaragolla and several bridges, viaducts, overpasses and underpasses will be designed at several locations.
The underpasses are especially for the elephants for them to move since the track will runs through jungle.
Under the 5-year plan of Lets Awaken Polonnaruwa District Development Programme (2016-2020), the rail track from Kurunegala to Habarana via Dambulla has been identified as a priority, he said.
The Habarana railway line will run across Dambulla and Sigiriya in the North Central Province providing convenient transportation for the people in the Eastern and North Central Provinces.
The project is funded through a loan from the EXIM Bank, China.
