Thera calls for genuine interest in development
Malwatte Chapter Anunayaka Ven. Dimbulkumbure Wimaladhamma Thera stated that most of the politicians launch development projects as if they had spent their own money and spends a similar amount in launching the project than it took to construct it.
He stated that the development projects carried out from the money of the public does not even need name boards of politicians. The Thera was addressing the ceremony held to mark the completion of three years of the Nelligala International Buddhist Institute, under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena on Duruthu Poya Day.
The roads leading to the Buddhist institute and the higher storey garden was open by the President.
The President had stated that Rs. 350 million was provided for the development of the institute which was the money of the general public which the Thera appreciated. He advised politicians who launch development projects as if they had spent their own money to take the President as a role model.
The President was born as a son of a farmer and started from the smallest place and rose to the top. He has a vast knowledge of the problems of the society and a wide experience.
Former President R. Premadasa similarly started from the smallest place and rose to the top. He was a practical leader. There is no doubt that President Sirisena has a good awareness of the problems of the people.
S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike once stated that a mans duty is to serve mankind and our president serves the public despite caste, colour or parties, stated the Thera.
Nelligala Buddhist Institute Ven. Wathkubure Dammarakkitha Thera, Central Province Chief Minister Sarath EKanayake and MP Mayantha Dissanayake also spoke. Central Province Governor Niluka Ekanayake, Sri Dalada Maligawa Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela also participated.

Vidarbha bag maiden Ranji Trophy title
INDORE, Monday: Led by a superb all-round display, Vidarbha capped off their historic run in Ranji Trophy 2017-18 season with a crushing win over Delhi in the final at the Holkar Stadium in Indore on Monday (January 1). The Faiz Fazal-led side beat Delhi by nine wickets to win their maiden Ranji Trophy title.
There were several players who stood out for Vidarbha at various stages in the final - in both batting and bowling. What began with debutant teenager Aditya Thakare striking a blow in the first over of the game, was followed by Rajneesh Gurbani's hat-trick on Day 2. While Faiz Fazal and Wasim Jaffer stroked crucial fifties to lay a solid platform for Vidarbha's response with the bat, it was a timely maiden first-class ton by Akshay Wadkar, ably supported by half-centuries from Aditya Sarwate and Siddesh Neral, which put Vidarbha in the driver's seat
Even as Vidarbha were in their maiden Ranji final, the youngsters in the side were ably guided by the experienced Wasim Jaffer, who had come into the game with eight Ranji titles to his credit. He was constantly communicating with the bowlers and batsmen and directed them at various stages in the game. He was even proactive in setting the fields. This was possibly the biggest difference between the two sides. Delhi were outclassed in experience, planning and application. One team had arrived for the occasion, the other hadn't.
Delhi 295 (Dhruv Shorey 145; Rajneesh Gurbani 6-59) and 280 (Nitish Rana 64; Akshay Wakhare 4-95)
Vidarbha 547 (Akshay Wadkar 133; Navdeep Saini 5-135) and 32-1.

Relatives of Samurdhi, Agri. Research Officers contesting polls
The UNP Chief Organizer for the Pelmadulla Electorate and Deputy Minister of Disaster Management, Dunesh Gankanda yesterday, complained to the Elections Commission that relatives of Samurdhi and Agriculture Research Officers were contesting for the upcoming polls. He pointed out that this had resulted in government officers directly participating in campaign activities on many occasions, violating the conditions of a free and fair election.
The minister addressed the media having made the complaint to the Commission at Rajagiriya.
Certain government officials have put forward their wives, brothers or close relatives and are exerting pressure on the voters in their areas. Samurdhi beneficiaries who depend on these government officials are especially vulnerable to these threats, he said.
He highlighted an example of the Pelmadulla Pradeshiya Sabha which consisted of 21 divisions, where five candidates are relatives of Samurdhi officers or Economic Development Officers. These officers have threatened the people that they would withhold their Samurdhi benefits if they did not vote for their relatives, said the minister.
He added that these five candidates belonged to the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna or the Pohottuwa Party.
He further informed the media that the Chairman of the Elections Commission had informed them that they had taken steps to issue a circular for government servants on how to act in such circumstances. Gankanda had requested that the Elections Commission decree that if a relative of a government servant was contesting for the election within the same division, that the government officer be transferred to another division and that transfer be effective for the next four years.
The Chairman of the Elections Commission had assured Gankanda that he would discuss his proposal at a meeting to be held with the Elections Commissioners today (3).

SP has risen to top in promoting education
Even at a national level, the Southern Province (SP) has risen to the top in all educational promotion activities, Southern Provincial Education Minister Chandima Rasaputhra said.
He made these views addressing as the guest of honour at a felicitation ceremony held in honour of the recently-retired principal Bengamuwe Wimala Thera of the Thihagoda Junior School.
There are some politicians who are inciting acts of thuggery and violence to gain their malicious political objectives. As a veteran and an experienced politician, I would never resort to such malpractices. Voters should be allowed to decide the future of a politician based on people-friendly services performed by him, Minister Rasaputhra said.
It is hardly possible to run a school while satisfying politicians, parents, etc. It is also difficult for a Buddhist monks with an abundant sense of kindness and compassion, to carry out the duties of a proper school adminstrator. Bengamuwe Wimala Thera was appointed principal of this school by me. The principal Thera maintained a proper administration in the school to the satisfaction of all, the minister added.
Minister Chandima Rasaputhra said that there is an excess of teachers in some schools, while other schools in remote rural areas in the region have a shortage of teaching staff. In spite of all these obstacles, he expressed his deep sense of gratitude to both teachers and students for making better academic achievements and bringing a honour to the Southern Province.
A recent survey carried out in the South has revealed that the lack of a proper and healthy atmosphere for children, poverty, and disruptions of families, had led to the decrease in examination results of some children.
The SPC Education Ministry is also exploring the possibility of getting these children going through difficulties and economic hardships, admitted to childrens homes to afford them quality education. Advanced countries in the world have adopted these strategies, he said.
He said children are the asset of the country. Financial allocations for them would not be an invaluable investment for a bright future, and not a mere expenditure and waste of money. He added that affording a sound education to every child in the Southern region would be the cherished aim of his ministry.
Minister Rasaputhra said that in the national educational development process, the study of Engineering Technology has been prioritized. Proper facilities have to be made for students for studies in that field.
Plans are afoot to further boost the academic attainments and examination results of all students in State schools in the Southern Province. Speedy measures have also been initiated to enhance physical and human resources in all schools in the Southern province he said.
The educational development of the children would be the vision and mission of the SPC Ministry of Education he further added.
Retired principal Bengamuwe Wimala Thera and several higher education officials also addressed the meeting.

100 and counting
It is not always that you find a newspaper celebrating one hundred years. In this competitive age where newspapers are struggling to survive against the electronic and social media getting to a hundred is quite an achievement. It is like grinding your way towards a hundred in Test cricket against one of the best bowling sides where no quarter is asked nor given.
Today (January 3, 2018) the Daily News completes one hundred years and joins its two other sister papers the Sunday Observer (183 years) and Dinamina (108 years) as the only three newspapers in the country to achieve this unique milestone in the history of the newspaper industry in Sri Lanka. No other rival newspapers come within touching distance to this long dynasty which the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited (Lake House) and its founder the late DR Wijewardene has created in the newspaper industry and set a glowing example for other newspapers to follow.
The history of the Daily News is replete with many individuals who had walked the corridors of Lake House and shaped the newspaper for what it is today. Some of them have served Lake House for as many as 25, 30, 40 and even 50 years giving their entire life to the institution in different capacities. Such was the impact that Lake House made on the reading public that the newspapers the institution produced shaped the lifestyle of the people.
The Daily News continues to serve the reading public even today and there is a common saying that people brought the paper to read the sports pages and the obituary advertisement page, which even in this competitive world still holds good.
At an age when rival newspapers struggle to compete with established papers the Daily News continues to move ahead stronger than ever as it looks towards another century.
CRICKET IN 2017
For those who say that Test cricket is dying because of the poor turnout at matches stats prove otherwise. The year 2017 shows that the longer format of the game was far from extinction. In fact the last four years have proved so. In 2017 of the 47 Tests played during the year 40 ended in wins with 7 draws, similar to 2016. The years 2014 and 2015 also show encouraging results with 33 wins from 41 Tests and 34 wins from 43 Tests respectively.
Although it was a year to forget for Sri Lanka, other nations like Bangladesh, India and Australia prospered. Bangladesh cricket came of age winning Tests against Sri Lanka and Australia while also being competitive in New Zealand and in India. India extended their domination as a world cricket power by winning nine successive Test series since 2015 under Virat Kohli to equal Ricky Pontings Australia between 2005 and 2008.
They also hold the unique record of holding the rubber against all nine oppositions since they beat Australia at home in March.
Steven Smith and Virat Kohli emerged as the batting giants of the year while spinners proved dominant. A dream run with the bat against England in the ongoing Ashes series enabled Smith to take his Test career average to 63.66 surpassed by only the great Sir Donald Bradman (batsmen with a minimum of 20 innings). In fact Smith ended 2017 as the leading run-getter in Tests with an aggregate of 1305 to pass 1000 runs in a calendar year for the fourth consecutive time.
Kohli ended as the top batter in ODIs with an aggregate of 1460 and in Tests scored 1059 runs to round up a good year for him as captain where India ended as no. 1 in Tests and no. 2 in ODIs.
Spinners dominated the list of leading wicket-takers for 2017 occupying six of the top eight positions. The ever improving Australian off-spinner Nathan Lyon ended the year as the leading wicket-taker with 63 scalps thereby becoming the first Australian spinner other than Shane Warne and Richie Benaud to top the wicket chart in a calendar year. Another off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin of India became the third bowler to take 50 wickets in three successive calendar years after Warne and Sri Lankas Muthiah Muralitharan.
Another Lankan bowler Rangana Herath became the first left-arm spinner to take 400 Test wickets while Pakistan leggie Yasir Shah became the first spinner to take a five-for in five consecutive Test matches.
It was also a good year for South Africas Keshav Maharaj who became his countrys most successful spinner in a calendar year with 48 scalps, ten more than Hugh Tayfields 38 in 1957.
The Test cricket fraternity welcomed Ireland and Afghanistan as its 11th and 12th Test-playing nations with both countries slated to make their debuts in 2018.
With the political climate undergoing a major change in Zimbabwe one hopes that cricket which has suffered much in the past 15 years following the exodus of white players will get back to normalcy and this once proud nation will become a strong force again.

Ambalantotas development plans still remain idle
Rays of development have not fallen upon Ambalantota with the coming of successive regimes. Plans were drawn up by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) for the development of Ambalantota several years ago, but the implementation of the plans still remains a dream, residents said. Ambalantota is the main economic hub in the Hambantota district.
The vehicular traffic congestion in the heart of Ambalantota prevails during pola days on Mondays and Thursdays. The Waduruppa road that runs from the heart of the town also gets congested with vehicles.
It is a narrow road; two vehicles cannot pass at at a time. The existing bus stand is situated on a small plot of land. It is insufficient for commuters to take shelter during rainy days.
The weekly pola is congested, and as such, consumers cannot move about freely to make their purchases. The Ridiyagama road is used as a bus stand for private and Ceylon Transport Board (CTB) buses, causing hardships to vehicular traffic.
The three-wheeler park on the Ridiyagama road is a hindrance to pedestrians. The clock tower in the heart of the town is used for propaganda by businessmen and politicians. The drains in the heart of the town remain clogged with garbage and refuse water. Certain businessmen throw refuse into the drains instead of dumping refuse in waste paper baskets. These drains pose a threat to the health of citizens.

Indices recorded a turnaround during the year to end in positive territory. The ASPI gained 2.26% while the S&P SL 20 gained 5.01%.
The Colombo bourse enters 2018 at the back of a turnaround year in 2017, where the country experienced improvements in many fronts with relation to the performance of the market.
Both the All Share Price Index and the S&P SL 20 index closed the year in positive territory after a lapse of two years and saw an improvement in trading activity. 2017 also brought about a record breaking year for foreign investment and for capital raising through rights issues.
While the market is encouraged by this performance, the CSE together with its stakeholders will continue with initiatives to develop the market in key areas of strategic importance, including in market development, product diversification, governance, and market infrastructure and risk management, said Rajeeva Bandaranaike CEO of Colombo Stock Exchange.
The extensive awareness drive, which saw capital market promotions in key foreign markets and in key towns around the country which was conducted in association with the SEC in 2017 will continue this year as well.
The Stock Exchange will also see a number of new listings in the coming year, some of which would be through new avenues.
We aspire to open the local market for foreign listings this year, at a time when business operations and capital flows are becoming increasingly globalized, and as Sri Lanka aspires to develop into a new center of economic strength and innovation. More emerging and growing businesses, especially across Asia today are considering the pros and cons of accessing public capital in a foreign market and are looking beyond their mature domestic markets.
This we believe, presents the CSE with an opportunity to attract such businesses to list in Sri Lanka.
We will also introduce a dedicated listing platform for our local SMEs - the core of the Sri Lankan economy. SMEs will therefore commencing this year, have the opportunity to raise capital and benefit from the Sri Lankan stock market and investors will have the opportunity to participate in this exciting and dynamic sector of the economy. e expect to make other key development related and stakeholder focused announcements as the year progresses.

A brief history of local and foreign newspapers
The Colebrooke-Cameron Commission appointed by the then British government to report on the affairs of administration of Sri Lanka in April 1829, recommended, in addition to the legislative reforms, the necessity of starting newspapers to restrict the powers enjoyed by the British governor. They also stressed that the non-existence of newspapers was the main reason for the boundless powers of the governor. Governor Wilmot Horton took serious note of the recommendation made by the Commission, when he arrived on October 23, 1831. He was notified to commence a newspaper.
As a consequence and under the auspices of the Colonial Government, the Colombo Journal was published 186 years ago on January 1, 1832. It was discontinued on December 31, 1833 to allow private enterprises to run newspapers. However, the true reason for the closure was that the Colombo Journal severely criticised the British government of the day.
English newspapers in 20th century
There were 13 English newspapers in the island at the beginning of the 20th century. The Ceylon Mohamdam (1900-1917) was the first newspaper to be published at the turn of the 20th century. It was followed by The Ceylon Standard in 1908, a paper published by a group of wealthy Sinhalese during the first decade of the nineteenth century. Don Richard Wijewardene, a dynamic young man and a Cambrian, made his entry as an entrepreneurhe was convinced that one of the most influential instruments in an independence struggle was the forceful might of the press: the print media. The Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited symbolizes, therefore, the intellect of this great man.
The Observer and Commercial Advertiser was the result of a joint venture by two Colombo-based merchants, G. Ackland and E.J.Darley, which was first published on February 4, 1834. The Observer and Commercial Advertiser later transformed into Ceylon Observer. Under the editorship of Christopher Elliott, a surgeon who turned journalist changed its name to Colombo Observer. The Observer severely criticized the government especially during the time of the 1848 rebellion. Elliott wanted the British rule in the island to end soon.
The colonial governor in an attempt to counter the harsh criticism wanted to commence another newspaper; the result was Ceylon Chronicle, edited by Rev. Samuel Owen Glenie, the Colonial Chaplain, which was issued in May, 1837. When the Bishop of India objected to this appointment, he was replaced with Postmaster General George Lee. There was a severe competition between the newspapers with the Governor and members of the civil service contributing to the Colombo Chronicle, while the Chief Justice and Auditor-General supported the Observer. The Weslyan press published Ceylon Advertiser and General Intelligence in September, 1845, which ceased in April, 1850. By then, the Observer newspaper was passed into A. M. Ferguson. Legislative Councilor John Ferguson was a prolific writer. R.H. Ferguson sold the paper to a syndicate of the European Association who in turn sold it to D. R. Wijewardena in 1923.
It would be interesting to note that at a time, the English papers were edited by full European boards, a Sinhalese named Miguel Silva who studied English, Logic, Latin, and Christianity at Wesley College became deputy editor of Observer in 1840s: Miguel was none other than Migettuwatte Gunanada Thera of Panaduraa Vaadaya fame.
A bi-weekly newspaper called the Kandy Herald printed in the office of the Times of Ceylon was published by some planters in the year 1864. A Local newspaper entitled Jaffna Freeman commenced publication in 1862, until it was closedown in 1879. The Catholic Messenger,which commenced publication in 1869, voiced the opinion of the Catholics for 150 years.
The Ceylon Independent, edited by George Wall, saw the light of the day in July 1888. The editor agitated for a more responsible form of government to the island. Later, it was passed into the hands of Sir Hector Van Cuylenburg and subsequently, A. E. Bultggens, who was a staunch Buddhist involved in the Buddhist revival movement. Under the editorship of great teacher and historian L. E. Blaze, operated the Ceylon Independent, which ceased its publication in 1937.
The Morning Leader newspaper was purchased by the de Soysa family. Sir James Pieris, Charles Pieris, and W. A. de Silva, the Sinhala novelist owned this newspaper. The Morning Leader was responsible for moulding the public opinion when it was being edited by Armond de Souza. From 1907-1921, which covered the Sinhala-Muslim Riots of 1915, a crucial juncture of our modern history. Morning Leader played a vital role with Armond de Souza criticizing the Martial Law proclaimed by the governor. After the death of de Souza, Prof J. C. L. Rodrigo became its editor. Its publication ceased in 1932.
Ceylon Daily News
D. R. Wijewardena, the newspaper magnate of Sri Lanka, commenced the Ceylon Daily News on January 3, 1918. Wijewardene fought for independence from the British rule. The Ceylon Observer [Sunday] commenced on February 4, 1923. The Ceylon Daily News was edited in its initial stages by distinguish editors such as S. J. K. Crowther, H. D. Jant, F. A. Martinus, A. V. Kulasingham, and E. T. de Silva. Silva was a pioneer and activist in the national movement.
During the latter part of the 20th century, Samasamajist, the journal of the LSSP (1937); Sun (1964); Siyarata, UNPs news sheet (1963); Weekend (1965), Ceylon Daily Mirror (1961), Island (1981), became prominent papers. The Times, which existed for over 130 years, was taken over by the government in August, 1977. The Times newspaper group was liquidated, paving the way for Ranjith Wijewardena, owner of Wijaya newspapers and the son of newspaper magnate D. R. Wijewardene, to purchase it in 1987. The Sunday Times commenced republication in June 1987. The controversial Sunday Leader commenced publication in June, 1994, and became competitive in the field of reporting political news, until its Editor Lasantha Wickrematunga was brutally murdered.
D. R. Wijewardene and his brother, Don Charles Wijewardene, bought the rights of the Sinhala newspaper, Dinamina and transformed it into a dynamic daily in the Island. In 1918, motivated by this success, D. R. bought an English paper, the Ceylonese. He paid Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam, the founder owner, Rs.16,000 for the paper, press, and goodwill. D. R. changed its name to Daily News, which is now a century-old and a household name in Sri Lanka.
In 1926, D. R. Wijewardene formed the company, the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd. By then, he had shifted his papers and their premises from the old, poorly-ventilated bungalow in Colombo 10, into Baillie Street, the very heart of Colombo-Fort. He had also purchased a prime block of land on the borders of the Beira Lake. In 1929, Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited moved into Lake House.
History of worlds newspaper publishing
The newspaper is a European invention. In Venice, as early as the 16th century, there had been wide circulation of handwritten news sheets filled with news on politics and wars in Italy and Europe. The first printed paper was published in Germany in 1609. They were heavily censored by the government and reported mainly only foreign news, current prices, etc. Newspapers flourished in London after the English government withdrew censorship in 1695. Low cost daily papers appeared in cities by the 1830s after the high speed presses commenced printing thousands of copies cheaply. By 1900, advertising revenues encouraged more important than party support. The New York City newspaper circulation reached the level of a million copies a day.
There was a small impact with the rise of radio in the 1930s, but television from the 1950s had a major impact on the industry. Afternoon papers suffered most. In all parts of the globe, the growth of the internet after 2000 and sophisticated mobile phones after 2010, proved financially disastrous to newspapers as advertisers deserted and subscriptions plunged. It is strange that this phenomenon did not affect the newspapers of Sri Lanka.
Changing the look of English news printing, on November 7, 1665, The Oxford Gazette began publication. It decisively was a two column, a clearly-titled and a clear-dated news sheet.
The first newspaper in the American colonies was the Benjamin Harris published Publick Occurrences, in Boston in 1690.
Germany, France, China, and Japan
16th century Germany also saw handwritten news subscribed by government officials and also merchants. With literacy growing sharply and the demand for news led to modifications in the physical size, visual appeal, war reporting, writing style and reporting. London set the pace before 1870. The paper was renamed The Times in 1788. In 1817, it was edited by Thomas Barnes, a sharp reviewer of parliamentary hypocrisy and a defender of freedom of the press.
The first newspaper in France was the Gazette de France, which was established in 1632 by the kings physician Theophrastus Renaudot, with the patronage of Louis XIII. Newspapers were subject to strict censorship and served as tools of propaganda for the monarchy.
Dissidents used ridicule and veiled meanings to spread their political condemnation. Between tyrannical rulers and a low-rate of literacy, Italy had little in the way of a serious newspapers. Gazzetta del Popolo (1848), was the leading voice for an Italian unification.
In China, during the late Han dynasty [3 AD], Bulletin of the Court was published for government news; a handwritten on silk and was read by government officialsperhaps the oldest. Robert Knight founded two English language daily papers, The Statesman and The Times of India, in Calcutta and Bombay, respectively, in early 19th century. Japanese newspapers began in the 17th century as yomiuri , meaning to read and sell or kawaraban, referring to the use of clay printing blocks, were printed handbills sold in major cities. The Japan Herald was the first modern newspaper that was published bi-weekly in Yokohama, by an Englishman named A. W. Hansard from 1861.

Catalonia crisis: Economy minister puts cost at 1bn
Spain's Economy Minister Luis de Guindos has put the cost of the Catalan independence crisis at around 1bn (890m; $1.2bn).
He told Spanish radio that it was due to the slowdown in the Catalan economy after the unauthorised independence referendum on 1 October.
Madrid's warnings about economic damage were a big part of its campaign against Catalan separatists in last month's regional election.
But this is the highest estimate yet.
de Guindos said growth in Catalonia had slowed from 0.9% to 0.4% in the fourth quarter.
"Catalonia used to have growth above that of Spain, it was one of the drivers of the Spanish economy," he told Spanish radio.Some 3,100 firms have moved their headquarters elsewhere as a result of the uncertainty.
Far from resolving the crisis, December's election highlighted the even nature of the region's split into pro-independence and unionist sides, and set the stage for further confrontation.
The separatists are best placed to form a new administration, with separatist groups winning 70 of 135 seats in parliament. However, the Ciudadanos (Citizens) party won the popular vote.
The region's former leader Carles Puigdemont - who is in self-imposed exile in Brussels - leads one of the separatist parties. His erstwhile deputy Oriol Junqueras - who is in jail in Madrid - heads another.
de Guindos urged the separatists to abandon the "unilateral way" and focus on the "basic necessities" of Catalan society.

CB to take regulatory action against ETI Finance and Swarnamahal
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka yesterday decided to take regulatory action against ETI Finance Ltd and Swarnamahal Financial Services PLC due to weak financial performances, CBSL Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy yesterday said.
Accordingly the CBSL has imposed several directions on the business of these companies and on their Board of Directors.
Governor Dr. Coomaraswamy expressed his confidence that the regulatory actions along with a potential local incorporate company to take several of the company subsidiary companies will turn the tide for these two bodies, which have been struggling in the business for several years.
He reassured the market and the depositors in ETI Finance and Swarnamahal that while there is a problem, it can be overcome. This is not a case of insolvency but a matter of illiquidity, he also pointed out.
Governor Coomaraswamy while observing that the depositors concern over the situation said that there is no need to panic about the situation.
He said that there will be no curtailment of interests and the interest payments will continue to be paid.
He said there will be several restrictions on placing some restrictions of capital repayments. There cannot be early redemption. In addition on maturity, the deposits are going to be rolled over for a period of six months.
The company gets about an inflow about RS. 1 billion and if we can curtail outflows for about few months, we can very quickly build up the liquidity and restore normalcy, the Central Bank Governor further said.
In consequent to the regulatory action, the Monetary Board has appointed a panel of three which will take over these companies which will run the business until the companies are stabilized. The panel includes retired CBSL Assistant Governor Sepala Ratnayake, the retired Deputy General Manager of the Bank of Ceylon C.A. Lionel and H.N. Tilakaratne, the former Assistant General Manager of the same bank.
Term of reference to this panel will be to revive these companies. There is already a business plan put forward by the existing directors. The panel will basically run the company and it will be responsible to make sure the CBSL directions given to the company will be properly applied, Governor Coomaraswamy explained.
Governor Coomaraswamy also said that in order to make sure the enforcement of the directions given to the company by the CBSL, six central bankers from the Non-Banking Financial Department are currently posted to the two finance companies. The said Central Bankers will be onsite for several weeks until the situation is stabilised.
Speaking on the Monetary Board directions on constraining the business of the said companies, Governor Coomaraswamy explained that They are restricted from disperse any loans, Credit facilities any other type of financial accommodations except with the prior written approval of the CBSL Non-Banking department or the management panel appointed to overlook the business affairs of this company by the CBSL.
They cannot invest any money in anything other than government securities and fix deposits, nor can they enter into any businesses other than financial services. Nor can they have any transaction with their holding company or its subsidiary companies. Governor Coomaraswamy said.
The only power the board of this company has to act as a liaison on matters related to depositors. They should also ensure effective recovery from the present financial Situation and look for potential investors. he added.
The ETI finance and Swarnamahal accounts for about 0.03% within the total assets of the banking and services sector, it was also pointed out.
Thus, Governor Coomaraswamy said that the systemic importance of the matter is less than negligible.
Asked how confidence the CBSL is about the stabilization of the two companies, Governor Coomaraswamy said the direct interference of the Central Bank in the matter will assure a positive outcome. He also pointed out that there were drastic mismanagement recorded by these two companies and negligence shown on CBSL directions to them as well.

CEA to strictly enforce polythene ban
The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) reiterated the complete ban of manufacturing, selling, possessing and using polythene food wrapping sheets, bags and rigifoam boxes, which came into effect on January 01 this year.
The CEA will thereafter take strict legal action against persons who are involved in the using of polythene products in order to support the government's endeavour of creating a polythene free environment.
Accordingly, consumers should use pollution free compostable and biodegradable food wrapping sheets and bags that get composted within 180 days in an industrial composting unit.
Speaking to Daily News Business, CEA Chairman Prof. Lal Dharmasiri said although the decision of banning the use of polythene was taken by the government last September, it was postponed for another three months due to several requests made by manufacturers.
Dharmasiri said as the initial step, from now onwards the CEA will check polythene manufacturers, distributors and persons who are keeping large stocks of polythene products in their possession.
Our officials will also visit traders, hoteliers, grocery shops, pharmacies and restaurants who defy the law by keeping polythene wrapping papers and bags in their possession."
Meanwhile, a compostable and biodegradable film manufacturer, Plastic Pakaging Chairman Dr Mervyn Dias said his company welcomed the government's decision and said it helps to create a polythene-free environment in the country. We are happy about the government's decision to ban the use of polythene bags and food wrapping sheets which pollute the environment, he said.
He said his company manufactures only the UK approved EN 13432 standard compostable and biodegradable papers to cater to both local and overseas markets.
Polythene papers take over 500 years to degrade and such a situation badly pollutes the environment and causes heavy damage not only to human beings and other living beings but also to fauna and flora, he said. When contacted All Ceylon Restaurant Association senior official Asela Sampath said he would bring this matter to the notice of relevant officials in due course.

A centurys fruition
The centenary that the Ceylon Daily News celebrates this year is also a hundred years where this newspaper, newspapers in Sri Lanka and indeed the media, in general, have metamorphosed several times over, serving different roles depending on the needs of the day.
A hundred years ago, in 1917, the Ceylon Daily News was born when Don Richard Wijewardene (known as DR to all), took ownership of The Ceylonese and re-christened it the Ceylon Daily News. Wijewardene was involved in the movement to gain Independence from Britain and was not shy to use his newspaper for that purpose. In that sense, the Ceylon Daily News had an enmeshed roe in the countrys politics from its very inception.
Four years earlier, in 1913, Wijewardene had been elected secretary of the Ceylon National Association, an organisation formed for the purpose of agitating for constitutional reform and self- rule. Its President at the time was James Peiris.
In 1919, the Ceylon National Association amalgamated with the like-minded Ceylon Reform League to form the Ceylon National Congress (CNC). Working with those who agitated for the countrys independence in the CNC brought DR into contact with those who would later become political heavyweights in the lead up to Independence. These included the likes of F R Senanayake, D S Senanayake, D B Jayatilaka, E W Perera, C W W Kannangara, Patrick de S. Kularatne, H W Amarasuriya, W A de Silva, George E de Silva and Edwin Wijeyaratne.
D S Senanayake was to later leave the CNC in 1943. In1946, he formed the United National Party (UNP). Wijewardene too gravitated towards the UNP and was particularly close to the father of the nation, D S Senanayake and his son, Dudley. As a result, his newspapers were increasingly identified as UNP newspapers.
DR passed away two years after the nation gained Independence leaving the company he founded, the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited (ANCL) to be run by his sons-in-law. By this time, DRs sister Helenas son, J R Jayewardene had also emerged as a leading figure in the UNP. Jayewardene was close to Esmond Wickremesinghe, DRs son-in-law who for all intents and purposes ran ANCL after DRs demise.
Lake House group
Therefore, it surprised none that the Lake House group supported the UNP and as the country was emerging as an Independent nation, it played a significant, if slightly unabashed pro-UNP role in moulding public opinion in what was already a highly politically literate electorate.
Lake House was not alone in this. Their erstwhile rivals, Independent Newspapers Limited, or the Davasa group owned by the Gunasena family, with relatively fewer links to political families but with the dynamic D B Dhanapala at the helm, was not averse to endorsing some of the policies of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
Matters came to a head in 1964. Even then, the Lake House was identified with the UNP and the government of Sirima Bandaranaike attempted to take over Lake House by introducing legislation in Parliament. The directors of Lake House, led by Esmond Wickremesinghe, ever the shrewd strategist, worked tirelessly around the clock lobbying SLFP parliamentarians to vote against the proposed Bill.
Thirteen of them did. They included the then Deputy Leader of the SLFP, C P de Silva and Mahanama Samaraweera, father of Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera. The vote was lost by one vote and led to the fall of the SLFP dominated government. Among those who could also claim credit for this were two others who voted against the proposed Bill, S Thondaman and Speaker Hugh Fernando, the latter an SLFP parliamentarian at the time, who had the casting vote with the votes tied for and against the Bill.
If Mrs Bandaranaike was thwarted then, it didnt stop her, nearly a decade later. After her return to power in 1970, the United Front government introduced the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited (Special Provisions) Law No. 28 of 1973 to nationalise 75 percent of the ownership of ANCL and the takeover of Lake House followed soon after.
The Davasa group which by then had fallen out of favour with the Bandaranaike government was sealed a year later in 1974 under emergency regulations which were initially enacted to quell the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna led an insurrection in 1971.
With Lake House under firm government control and the Davasa group out of circulation, media freedom became a crucial issue for the UNP-led opposition which called for a boycott of Lake House newspapers. It would have been a factor- among many other issues- that led to the downfall of the SLFP led coalition in 1977, with the UNP returned to power with a record majority.
State media
The UNP lifted the restrictions on the Davasa group which resumed publication but did not reverse the nationalisation of Lake House which remains under state control to this day; forty years later under successive UNP and SLFP led governments.
Interestingly, D R Wijewardenes son and heir, Ranjit, instead of reclaiming Lake House, has gone on to acquire the publishing rights of several other newspapers. These publications, including The Sunday Times, Daily Mirror and Lankadeepa have now established themselves as being relatively independent, publishing under the banner of Wijeya Newspapers Limited.
Nevertheless, the state media is not what it was a few decades ago. If media was restricted to one radio station, the state-run Radio Ceylon and a few newspapers four decades ago, it has now evolved into a mammoth network of a multitude of radio stations, television networks and newspapers, a few of them still run by the state but the others all privately owned and operated.
The last decade has also seen the exponential growth of social media, powered by that ubiquitous vehicle, the internet. Now, the news is available to the public as instantly as events occur and with practically everyone possessing a smartphone almost any incident has someone covering it with video footage.
It was not long ago that governments in this country appointed a censor who would edit sections of news reports and leave newspaper editors tearing their hair in agony. Today, in an era driven by electronics and technology, censorship has become redundant. Instead, governments have to compete with private media organisations to get their message across to the public. Arguably, this has become the main objective of the state-owned media.
Even so, it has had to evolve with the times. Newspapers are no longer the broadsheet that one held with both hands while being sprawled in an armchair. They are now read electronically, not only on computers but on handheld mobile phones. Therefore, a web edition is a must for a newspaper, if it is to remain viable and it goes without saying that these editions must render live information.
Even in countries with advanced technology and mature democracies such as Britain and Australia, the newspaper as we know it, has died. It is no longer printed on paper, nor is it delivered at the doorstep. It simply arrives in the e-mail and is accessed through a subscription. Sri Lanka, blessed with a slower paced society still honours the concept of a newspaper printed on paper but only time will tell whether this will survive as the world hurtles through the information revolution.
Increasingly competitive market
In the present day and age, can a state-owned newspaper survive, being a vehicle for what many perceive as government propaganda Will there be a demand for such a product in an increasingly competitive market where the axiom that news is what needs to be suppressed, all the rest is advertising, holds true more than ever Obviously not.
If so, what should government-owned newspapers- and other media too- do to remain viable Do they cease being His Masters Voice as the Lake House was once famously derided How does it strike that delicate balance
In such an environment, government-owned newspapers- and indeed television stations- have to do more than their rivals to stay competitive. It may have the financial resources of the state to expand and innovate but it may not have the license to publish and be damned. Thus it has to tread warily, toeing that fine line which is to be objective, critical but not too offensive, all at the same time. In many ways, therefore, it is harder to be a journalist in a state media outlet now than it would have been, say, forty years ago.
The Ceylon Daily News has not only survived through all these changes, it has also evolved and prospered. The edifice that DR built, the Lake House building at the heart of the city still houses it. It still commands a substantial circulation and is the leading resource for advertisers. DR, had he been around, may recognise only the stylised masthead of the Ceylon Daily News, but it is more than likely that, surveying the changes that have been wrought in the institution that he created, he would surely commend, rather than condemn.

Also in 2017, to combat dengue problem, the CSSL partnered with Nantang University Singapore, Skoll Global, Colombo Municipal Council and University of Colombo School of Computing to develop a digital solution to manage the environment and all relevant aspects better. This project was fully foreign funded, international relations supporting CSSL being nationally impactful.
In 2017, to support new innovations and emerging IT professionals, the CSSL supported a hackathon event together with Garnes Labs. Australian Computer Societys Digital Assets platform was made available for CSSL members at a discounted rate. CSSL IT Mastermind was organized for the 6th year, while CSSL Tech Talks, CIO Forum and CSSL ICT Awards were also organized successfully enriching the IT sector. The organization has made major strides in making their degree accreditation process globally acceptable by entering into the process of becoming a signatory of the global standardization scheme, Seoul Accord.
At the AGM held this week, CSSL President while thanking his broad membership for re-electing him as well as his executive council once again, pledged that the executive council will expand its work in 2018.
He stressed the importance of younger IT professionals joining the professional body and he will take lead in implementing strategies to achieve this.

Daily News chalks up 100 years
The Ceylon Daily News, or Daily News, to our readers, chalks up 100 years today.
This is a rare milestone in any field of activity, more so for a newspaper whose survival depended on the marketability of the product and the goodwill of the readership.
It has been a rewarding journey, though not without its own share of obstacles restrictions and setbacks.Being a state owned newspaper it had been a careful balancing act that the Daily News had to perform if the credibility of the newspaper were to be preserved and the faith of the readership retained . That it has fulfilled this task with success is borne out by the response received from the readership and in the healthy statistics in our circulation.
This , in the face of stiff competition with other publications which practise the trade in a less restrained environment and are more at liberty to venture out into controversy and sensationalism.
A century is a long time in the existence of a newspaper.Even in the liberalised West we hear of newspapers folding up due to dwindling readership and financial restraints .The long running BBC recently laid out staff and cut down on its programme content due to reasons of financial instability .In that sense how the Daily News survived for 100 long years with only a miniscule fraction of the population comprising the English readership should provide an interesting study.
That it has withstood the test of time and emerged to the fore as the leading publication in the country among the English speaking readership is a testament to its resilience and dynamism that any newspaper could be proud of.
The newspaper ,no doubt, owes its success to the giants in the field of English journalism of the past whose skills with the pen took the paper to the far reaches across the country and went onto earn a niche for itself as the leading publication of the day.
The Daily News even today boasts of a skilled and enterprising staff who endeavour to provide our readership with a quality newspaper at all times.It has evolved over the decades whereby product has improved with the introduction varied topics and features catering to a diverse and critical readership.
The newspaper strives to provide a balanced coverage on all subjects and controversial topics, and, though a state managed entity, always provides space for the other side and accommodates views that are critical of the government.
As it steps into the next century, the Daily News will endeavour to maintain its quality and excellence and provide our readership with absorbing news, feature articles and material on diverse topics and entertainment.

Daily News pioneers Business news in Sri lanka
With the open economy being introduced in 1977, Sri Lankan enterprises started to open up to the world and new lines of enterprises and entrepreneurs were created. With the closed economy being something of the past, the exports sector started to open up and more aggressively imports started to boom which resulted in the expansion of the corporate sector.
It was during this backdrop that the Daily News which commenced publishing on January 3, 1918, decided to publish Sri Lankas only dedicated Business section in early 1980s under the then Editor Manik De Silva who is considered the father of business journalism in Sri Lanka.
The pages were first published every Tuesday and soon a Thursday edition too was introduced making Daily News Business the first business section in the history of Sri Lankan journalism.
Mohan Samarsinghe, Chithra Weerasighe, Elmo Leonard and Preethi Kodagoda were among the first contributors to the Business section. The first business editorial was written by Arjuna Ranawana who was also a one-time Daily News Editor.
Later the Business section became a daily pull out and it was headed by Nishtar Cassim, Chandani Jayatillike, Ravi Ladduwahetty, Lionel Yodasinghe, Channa Kathurisinghe, Shirajiv Sirimane (present), Anjana Samarasinghe and Lynn Ockersz. Some of the longest serving sub editors in the Business section with over 10 years at the desk were Dudley Jansz and Pravin Mendis.
Today the Daily News Business section is published from Monday to Friday. The present team includes Shirajiv Sirimane (Editor), Fizel Jabir, Indunil Hewage, Sandra Thalgahagoda, Diresh Jayasuriya, Anusha Wickramasekara and Manuela Motha.

Before the digital boom swept the newsroom
I was ushered into the newsroom of the Daily News in the mid-1960s by D. J. (Ira) Ameresekere, the then Chief Administrative Officer, (CAO) of Lake House. I had faced a panel of journalistic heavyweights only two days before. The panel included the chain-smoking CAO Ira Ameresekere, Bonny Fernando; his deputy, Ernest Corea, the Daily News editor; and Denzil Peiris, the mercurial editor of the Observer and Sunday Observerall living legends in the realm of the printing word.
The avuncular CAO virtually handed me over to the charge of the editor Ernest Corea, who promptly assigned me to the news and sports desks. Newsrooms in their heyday were rough and ready places, and the Daily News editorial was no exception. I was fortunate in that I had had a short stint as a free-lancer on the rival newspaper the
Daily Mirror, so the rowdy ambience did not hold any sort of culture shock as far as I was concerned.
The Daily News, when I joined it half a century ago, was what could aptly be described as a staid old maid, because of its traditionally remarkable and often stifling structure, with neither much latitude nor encouragement for creativity. Reporters and feature writers were seldom rewarded with by-lines and its headlines were unexcitingly bland. The writing style and page make-up were lacklustre, but it was a paper read and consulted by decision-makers in government and merchant princes in the private commercial sector. Styling itself on the ultra-conservative London Times, it was the diametrically opposite of its sister paper, The Observer, an afternoon broadsheet which gave its writers frequent by-lines and was bright, breezy, and audacious in comparison.
But all that was to change almost a decade later in the 70s when bolder and visionary editors took charge of the morning daily and gave it a more spirited character in format, headlines, and writing style. In those early days, everybody, well, almost everyone, was a manjournalism was basically a male preserve. Sub-editors handling general news worked with pencil and paper. Their desk was horseshoe-shaped and occupied by older fogeys, rim men who sat around the outside. The guy in charge, the crusty old chief-sub, sat in the
slot so he could reach all the rim guys when he needed to hand out stories to work on. Many of them were stodgy veterans of their craft who did not take kindly to females on the desk. Nor were they tolerant of cheeky young male recruits. There were few women on the roll when I was assigned soon after my stints on the news and sports departments to the foreign desk.
I recall vividly, some of them including Vijita Fernando, who edited the womens pages. Vijita was a sister confessor of sorts who always lent a willing ear to those troubled colleagues who sought her advice. Her memorable acts of kindness will never be forgotten by those who sought her out during times of distress. I recall some of the other attractive feminine colleagues, draped in sarees, who lit up the editorial landscape by their mere presence. They include Mallika Wanigasundera, Yogarani Devadason, and Indres Alalasunderam, attached to the features department, all very competent journos who were aces at their demanding craft. Others who stood out for their beauty and intellect, who worked alongside me on the Foreign Desk, were Rosemary Moonemalle and Swarnapali Wijesiritwo of the most loyal and vivacious colleagues. It had been my good fortune to have known them in my long and varied journalistic career. Rosemary, as a gorgeous young undergrad at Peradeniya University, had been once deservingly crowned Campus Queen.
In those heady days of journalism, the paper was populated by a tribe of information hunters looking askance at the rest of the world. And very often, the culture of that tribe was literally funny, because the mostly eccentric scribblers loved to laugh. We are among some of the last surviving links of that gloriously brave era.
Humour is both a weapon and a tool in the newsroom. If you did not have a sense of humour at the time, you would have been given a by-pass to set it flowing like a faucet.The newsroom was largely about momentum and conflict, and what environment presents more opportunities for both than a buzzing media centre where everyone was chasing down stories, conjuring up headlines, rewriting copy, making phone calls, and having loud opinionated conversations The newspaper then had its own stable of colourful characters who enlivened and adorned the atmosphere with professional panache. As one who has had a merry run in a varied and unrestrained journalistic career, both here and overseas, I have encountered my share of the most improbable personalities who ever put pen to paper.
But for sheer audacity, ebullience, and charm, none could have matched the irreverent bunch of newspapermen who strode the expansive corridors of Lake House with a haughty vivacity. But that was in the mid-60s and late 70s, a phase in the profession which many regard as the Golden Age of Sri Lanka journalism.
The newsrooms then were a citadel of power and a sanctuary for madcap antics.
They were also a bundle of contradictions, full of noise and bursting with mayhem. Their denizens were swaggering with certitude, yet sometimes endearingly insecure, cynical, but inextinguishably idealistic. Many were loud, cocky, and rowdy. Typewriters clattered, teletype machines buzzed, and phones rang incessantly.
Reporters badgered sources over heavy, old-fashioned rotary dialling phones with hopelessly twisted cords. Editors and desk heads yelled expletives. Liquor bottles leaked from desk drawers as cigarette butts smouldered in ash trays. Everything happened at a hectic pace. Pranksters letting off steam and the duelling of witty repartee were the order of the day. They say its the adrenaline that kept it all going. Every day, this place called a newsroom brought together the thrill of the hunt and a race against time.
The editorial was a study in personalities. It was full of diverse faces, old faces and young, but all exuding character. All around you were both enemies and friends. Usually, we worked together for the common end. No one came into journalism or a newsroom in those days unless they had enough of an ego to fend for themselves and to fight battles. Shrinking violets in this game got trod upon.
As a stripling, I did my share as an all-round journalist in those hallowed journals. I was privileged to have worked with some of the greats of the era. For that I am grateful, because the experience has served me in good stead in the newsrooms of a diversity of capitals in the Asian region.
It was a time when the massive presses rumbled beneath the editorial floor competing with the maddening din of the newsroom with the steady beat of the afternoon edition, giving a sense of ominous doom to the fast approaching late-night deadline for the morning paper. Today, the deadline is 24/7. What is a deadline, you may ask Unless you still work in a daily newspaper you probably dont have one.
Noisy mechanical typewriters created a racket, while staffers bellowed into bulky black Bakelite telephones with short cords anchoring them to their wooden desks and a haze of cigarette smoke filled every corner of the room. The newsroom was crowded with journos frantically scribbling or hammering away at stories, frantic sub-editors conjuring up headlines, teletype machines click-clacking away, copyboyswe called them peons thenrunning here, there and everywhere to carry stories to the printer and do odd jobs.
There is a wide streak of sentimentality running through old journalists. We tend to go all misty-eyed when they describe the Linotype machines in the printing room spewing out their slugs of hot metal and the building shuddering slightly when the presses started up. While longing for the rollicking flavour of old newspapering, I consider myself fortunate in having straddled the decades of change for the system to move from hot metal to cold type, and on to the manual cutting and pasting, to be finally eliminated in favour of digital pagination. Through it all, with drunks not being tolerated anymore and smoking disallowed on the premises, it still remains the same game in so many ways. The method may be cleaner and more efficient, but the deadlines, the breaking news, the front page felonies, and the banner headlines have not changed.
As the media landscape evolves with bewildering rapidity, only one thing is certain for newspaper editors and all journalists: journalism is changing, and they must change with it if they are to successfully confront the new challenges. But dont forgetit doesnt matter how good the technology is, you still need to find and tell a good story. The technology is helpful but you have to have the mind of a reporter. You have to understand how to tell a story.

Eluding the clutches of cardiovascular disease
As the new year dawns, it is important that we take a minute to assess our health and understand one of the most common causes of deaths in Sri Lankacardiovascular diseases (CVD). There are two types of heart diseases related to a process called atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a condition that develops when plaque builds up in the walls of the arteries. This build-up narrows the arteries, making it harder for blood to flow through. If a blood clot forms, it can stop the blood flow. This can cause a heart attack or stroke.
A heart attack occurs when the blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked by a blood clot. If this clot cuts off the blood flow completely, the part of the heart muscle supplied by that artery begins to die. Most people survive their first heart attack and return to their normal lives to enjoy many more years of productive activity.
An ischemic stroke happens when a blood vessel that feeds the brain gets blocked, usually from a blood clot. When the blood supply to a part of the brain is cut-off, that part of the brain will die. The result will be the inability to carry out some of the previous functions as before, such as walking or talking. A haemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel within the brain bursts. The most likely cause is uncontrolled hypertension.
CVDs are the number one cause of death globally: people die annually from CVDs more than from any other cause. An estimated 17.7 million people died from CVDs in 2015, representing 31 percent of all global deaths. Of these deaths, an estimated 7.4 million were due to coronary heart disease and 6.7 million were due to stroke. More importantly, over three quarters of CVD deaths take place in low and middle-income countries.
Out of the 17 million premature deaths (under the age of 70) due to non-communicable diseases in 2015, 82 percent are in low and middle-income countries, and 37 percent are caused by CVDs. Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.
People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management using counselling and medicines, as appropriate.
No matter what your age, everyone can benefit from a healthy diet and adequate physical activity.
Choose a healthy eating plan
The food you eat can decrease your risk of heart disease and stroke. Choose foods low in saturated fat, transfat, and sodium. As a part of a healthy diet, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, fibre-rich whole grains, fish (preferably oily fish-at least twice per week), nuts, legumes, and seeds and try eating some meals without red meat. Select lower fat dairy products and poultry (skinless). Limit sugar-sweetened beverages and red meat such as beef, lamb, and mutton. If you choose to eat such meat, select the leanest cuts available.
Be physically active
You can slowly work up to at least 2 hours (150 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity (e.g., brisk walking) every week or 1 hour and 15 minutes (75 minutes) of vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity (e.g., jogging, running) or a combination of both in every week. Additionally, on two or more days a week, you need muscle-strengthening activities that work all major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms). Children should get at least 60 minutes of activity every day.
Looking out for the warning signs
Its never too early or late tolearn the warning signs of a heart attack and stroke. Not everyone experiences sudden numbness with a stroke or severe chest pain with a heart attack. Heart attack symptoms in women can be different than men.
If you start getting smart about your heart in your 20s, it will put you far ahead of the curve. The things you do and dont are a tell-tale sign of how long and how well youre going to live, said Richard Stein, M.D. Theres no one I know who said: I felt better being sedentary. I felt better eating a terrible diet, said Stein, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at New York University School of Medicine further. All these things actually make you feel better while they help you.
Find a doctor and have regular wellness exams
Healthy people need doctors too. Establishing a relationship with a physician means you can start heart-health screenings now.
Talk to your doctor about your diet, lifestyle and check your blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate, blood sugar, and body mass index. You may also need your blood sugar checked if you are pregnant, overweight or have diabetes. Knowing where your numbers stand early makes it easier to spot a possible change in the future.
Quit smoking and avoid sedentary smoking
If you have been addicted to smoking as a teen, its time to quit smoking. Even exposure to second-hand smoke poses a serious health hazard. Non-smokers are up to 30 percent more likely to develop heart disease or lung cancer from second-hand smoke exposure at home or work, according to a U.S. Surgeon General report.
Make heart-healthy living a family affair
Create and sustain heart-healthy habits in your kids and youll reap the benefits too. Spend less time on the couch and more time on the move. Explore a nearby park on foot or bike. Shoot some hoops or walk the dog. Plant a vegetable and fruit garden together in the yard, and invite your children into the kitchen to help cook.
Know your family history
Shake down your family tree to learn about heart health. Having a relative with heart disease increases your risk, and more so if the relative is a parent or sibling. That means you need to focus on risk factors you can control by maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, not smoking and eating right. Also, keep your doctor informed about any heart problems you learn about in your family.
Tame your stress
Long-term stress causes an increase in heart rate and blood pressure that may damage the artery walls. Learning stress management techniques not only benefits your body, but also your quality of life. Try deep breathing exercises and find time each day to do something you enjoy. Giving back through volunteering also does wonders for knocking out stress.
If even at 40, heart health hasnt been a priority, dont worry. Healthy choices you make now can strengthen your heart for the long haul. Understand why you need to make a lifestyle change and have the confidence to make it. Then, tackle them one at a time. Each success makes you more confident to take on the next one, said Stein, an American Heart Association volunteer.
Watch your weight and Body Mass Index (BMI)
You may notice your metabolism slowing down in your 40s. But you can avoid weight gain by following a heart-healthy diet and getting plenty of exercise. The trick is to find a workout routine you enjoy. If you need motivation to get moving, find a workout buddy.
Have your blood sugar level checked
In addition to blood pressure checks and other heart-health screenings, you should have a fasting blood glucose test by the time youre 45. This first test serves as a baseline for future tests, which you should have every three years. Testing may be done earlier or more often if you are overweight, diabetic or at risk for becoming diabetic.
Dont brush off snoring
Listen to your sleeping partners complaints about your snoring. One in five adults has at least mild sleep apnea, a condition that causes pauses in breathing during sleep. If not properly treated, sleep apnea can contribute to high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke.
Unlike the emergence of wrinkles and grey hair, what you cant see as you get older is the impact aging has on your heart. So starting in the 50s, you need to take extra steps.
Follow your treatment plan
By now, you may have been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes or other conditions that increase your risk for heart disease or stroke. Lower your risk by following your prescribed treatment plan, including medications and lifestyle and diet changes.
With your 60s comes an increased risk for heart disease. Your blood pressure, cholesterol, and other heart-related numbers tend to rise. Watching your numbers closely and managing any health problems that arise along with the requisite healthy eating and exercise can help you live longer and better.
Have an ankle-brachial index test
Starting in your 60s, its a good idea to get an ankle-brachial index test as part of a physical exam. The test assesses the pulses in the feet to help diagnose Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD), a lesser-known cardiovascular disease in which plaque builds up in the leg arteries.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe Message
Enforcing a culture of independence
It is humbling to reflect on the fact that it has been one hundred years since my grandfather, Don Richard Wijewardene, published the first issue of the Daily News on January 3, 1918. The newspaper began, as did its sister paper Dinamina, as a champion of the national independence movement and as an instrument to educate and activate the public through facts. My grandfather believed, as I do, that a vibrant national press would be foundational to any real democracy.
Indeed, in the past one hundred years, Sri Lanka has had several English newspapers rise and fall while overcoming civil unrest and a war against terror, while the Daily News alone has stood the test of time and remained a fixture in households and offices across the country. Its history is not without blemish. The newspaper, like many others, has seen dark times.
Political agendas and fiction have triumphed over facts, and management turned a blind eye as journalists across the country were abducted, beaten and killed.
It is with this perspective that the present management deserves commendation for enforcing a culture of independence and balance in the newsroom. Indeed, some of the most incisive coverage of many stories perceived to be critical of this government, have reached the public through the pages of the Daily News. On behalf of all Sri Lankans, I salute the journalists, editors and administrators of our nations oldest English-language newspaper, and wish them yet another one hundred years of service to the very fabric of our society.

Expiration of US GSP, routine issue - Ramal Jasinghe
The expiration of US Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) for Sri Lanka is a routine issue and not a politically motivated move said Chairman, Sri Lanka National Chamber Exporters (NCE) Ramal Jasinghe.
He said some of the exports, such as apparel, tea, rubber and coconut based products would not be affected but nearly 3,000 other products would have an impact. He said that these include packaging material and plastic accessories as well.
The US Embassy in Sri Lanka said on December 29t hat the United States Congress did not re-authorize GSP before adjourning for the year.
Jasinghe said that they were confident that the expiration of US Generalized System of Preferences would soon be settled. The GSP entitlement for Sri Lanka and other beneficiary countries could be renewed and returned as soon as the US Congress re-authorises it at any time. However what we are worried is the time it would take to put it right, he cautioned.

Former Navy Spokesman further remanded
Former Navy Spokesman Commodore D. K. P. Dassanayake and five others arrested on the charge of aiding and abetting the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009 were yesterday ordered to be further remanded till January 16 by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
The Court had earlier refused to grant bail on the suspects citing that there is no exceptional circumstances to release the suspects on bail. Six suspects including former Navy spokesman were produced before Court by prison officials.
The Court yesterday recorded a statement from a witness in the case following a request by the defence. On a previous occasion, the Court had issued an order directing the Superintendent of the Welikada Prison that former Navy Spokesman Commodore D. K. P. Dassanayake be transferred to the Prison Hospital from the Welikada Navy Hospital.
The Magistrate made the order taking into consideration a request made by by the prosecution and the aggrieved party of the case alleging that 7th suspect D. K. P. Dassanayake was enjoying special privileges while being at Welisara Navy Hospital contrary to the normal prison procedure.
On July 12, the CID arrested the former Navy Spokesman at the Sri Lanka Navy base in Welisara, following an investigation into the incident. On a previous occasion, the CID informed Court that the 11 persons who were abducted by unidentified groups in Colombo and the surrounding areas in 2008, had been taken to underground detention cells at a Navy camp in Trincomalee which were supervised by a Navy Lieutenant Commander.
The missing persons had been abducted by an unidentified group at Dehiwala, Battaramulla and Wattala in 2008 and 2009. Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara with OIC of the CIDs Gang Robbery Unit-Inspector Nishantha Silva prosecuted. Counsel Achala Seneviratne appeared for the aggrieved parties.

The Yahapalana Government will strictly comply with all election laws at the upcoming Local Government Elections 2018, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Premier Wickremesinghe made this observation at the signing of the proposed criteria for media for a free and fair election. The event was held at Temple Trees yesterday morning.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the government began New Year 2018 with signing the proposed criteria for media which will soon be tabled in Parliament.
As a government, we are dedicated to abide by the law. We will comply with all election rules at the upcoming elections. It is an achievement of this government to introduce a new electoral system to the country as well, he said.
The criteria for media is introduced to ensure the impartiality of media by the strict compliance of guidelines.
He pointed out that the new system allows voters to elect a candidate from their own electorate and it also creates space for a 25 percent female representation as well.
This new electoral system, whereby a candidate is not elected although a large number of votes are received by a party, allows electing a candidate on a ratio basis, he pointed out.
We will apply the new electoral system this time as a part of good governance, Premier Wickremesinghe said.
The Election Commission published 32 criteria to the media, through a gazette notification on December 4 for which the Cabinet approval was granted.
The guidelines have been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers and Parliaments approval is sought in order to make the document legitimate. All media divisions will be bound by the criteria and it is their responsibility and duty to abide by them.
Minister Vajira Abeywardena, Minister Sagala Ratnayaka, Minister Rauf Hakeem, Minister Mano Ganeshan, State Minister Palitha Range Bandara, Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and Prime Ministers Secretary Saman Ekanayake also participated.

ANCL Chairman Krishantha Cooray's Message
A historic milestone
It has been my privilege to play a role in the journey of the Daily News and to steward its exceptional team through this historic milestone in the life of our nation.
For one hundred years, this newspaper has been held in the hands of our citizens, and keeping them abreast of what is happening in our country through sun or rain, curfews and failed coup de tat.
As my friend Lasantha Wickrematunge wrote in his own obituary shortly before he was slain, the free media serve as a mirror in which the public can see itself sans mascara and styling gel. From us, you learn the state of your nation, and especially its management by the people you elected to give your children a better future.
While those were not our finest hours, it is our duty to reflect on and learn from such episodes, and forge a culture and systems into our institution that ensures a level of journalistic integrity and balance that can withstand whatever challenges the future presents.
In that regard, I could not be prouder of the example set by our Editor Mr. Lallith Allahakkoon and the entire editorial team, who strive every day to do justice to the public trust and ensure that the citizens of this country get the news that matters to them, with the level of detail they require to fulfill their own civic duties, whatever they may be.
It is no coincidence that the revival of this newspapers independence came under a government distinguished by a President and Prime Minister who both worked at Lake House before entering politics, and a Media Minister with a unique intuition for the media. It is in this context that I join the leaders of our country in doffing my hat to the Daily News team, and looking ahead to the next chapter in our journey together.

A HUNDRED YEARS THAT FULFILLED A NATIONAL OBLIGATION
A hundred years in any field of endeavour is a unique achievement indeed. Doubly so for a newspaper which has withstood the passage of time and going from strength to strength in catering to the needs of its readership.
The Ceylon Daily News, which chalks up its centenary today, can look back with pride to where it has reached and what it has achieved after its long and chequered journey. Tribute is due to all those who toiled to make the newspaper what it is today, during its evolutionary stages.
The Daily News, over the years, has brought historical and groundbreaking events, upheavals, wars, plagues, and famines, both in this country and abroad, to the attention of the public through the pens of professionals in the field that the Daily News was famous for, in those halcyon days.
The newspaper continues to strive to maintain this quality in catering to its vast readership to the best of its ability. The feedback we get is encouraging indeed. It boasts of a fine team of journalists who strive for excellence and report events and incidents accurately. The newspaper has the capacity to meet the demands of its vast and diverse readership through its special segments.
During the war against terrorism, the Daily News was one of the few newspapers which reported the action from the battlefront and gave the news as it happened. It was the same in the thick of events in the political battles as well, providing balanced reportage, although we are a state-owned entity. The Daily News is no stranger to both bouquets and brickbats which we take in our stride as journalists who are impervious to such matters but continue with the job of providing news and entertaining reading to the public.
The insurgency in the late eighties was a hard time for the Daily News as for its sister publications. The ban imposed by rebel elements on all Lake House newspapers saw a drastic drop in circulation.
There were even death threats on Lake House staff including journalists of the Daily News. However, the newspaper was published without interruption and the staff worked round-the-clock to bring out the paper disregarding the danger, as true journalists who are equipped to defy the odds.
Times have changed. From being a monopoly in the field of publication to meeting the vast competition in the modern day, the newspaper has stood stolidly and striven to provide the best to its readers.
It was not always plain sailing. The Daily News, with its sister publications, had to face many challenges and vicissitudes during its long journey. There was the infamous takeover of Lake House by the then government which was a major setback and saw the content and the quality of the product take a beating.
However, it still managed to retain its vast readership, chiefly due to the rare skills of the journalists the newspaper is able to boast. Its editorials were made standard reading to students by their parents and teachers for the unique quality of the prose of the now long-departed stalwarts.
The Founder of the Lake House Group, the late D. R. Wijewardene recognised the need for reaching out to the public with information at a time the independence movement was gathering momentum. The Daily News, it must be said, fulfilled this role admirably, providing the English readers the opportunity to be up to date on the ongoing developments.
In its long journey, the newspaper was brought out in various forms, formats, and styles and is, today, produced by the state-of-the-art technology by a fine production team, in a way that appeals to readers.
The Daily News has fulfilled a national role in keeping the public informed of matters over its century-long journey and while we turn a new page into the newspapers next landmark, we hope to receive the same support and patronage of our beloved readership which we received in ample measure over the years.

Icon of nationalism
The physical presence of the Lake House building is enough to awaken a sense of awe in all those who behold it. The building commissioned by D.R. Wijewardena, is a white colossal monument that has dominated the landscape, housing some of the most revered newspapers in the world.
Department of Architecture University of Moratuwa, Senior Professor of Architecture, Prof. M S Manawadu was involved in the construction of the Eastern Wing which had been commissioned to the architectural firm he was working for in 1978. Somewhere in 2000, the management wanted to do an interior refurbishment for the building and Manawadu was invited. Since they wanted more space he proposed a Mezzanine floor in the frontal wing, just above the counters.
Lake House was designed by Architect Sir Oliver Weerasinghe, a key figure when it came to the profession of architecture in Sri Lanka. He studied in England, came here and practiced as an architect. There were family ties involved in building Lake House, Manawadu shared his views on the architecture of Lake House.
Though the building was designed by a foreign educated and experienced architect, he has introduced traditional building elements in decorating the facade.
If you take the twin pillars of Lake House and they have been borrowed from the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa architecture. There is an inverted lotus bud. If you take the Kandy Council chamber, in the wooden building next to the Dalada Maligawa, you get twin columns. And when you look at the independence hall there are twin columns again, he explained.
The individual column heads resemble pillars from the Anuradhapura period, and the brackets derive from Kandyan Pekada (of timber). The only difference is that at Lake House it is in concrete.
The floral designs are derivative of Araliya flowers. Araliya flower is unique to the Sri Lankan architecture. Lake House is a unique building with a hybrid of local and foreign traditions. Architectural characteristics are mainly local, but the style is true European Colonial. That was the period where the British architects were trying to copy the Sri Lankan traditional architectural elements into their buildings. The nationalist fervor was there. The architects were responding to those requirements. So the British buildings appeared with Pseudo architecture traditions with elements borrowed from the Sri Lankan traditions, said Manawadu.
Anyone who has been in Lake House for the first time knows how confusing it is to navigate this labyrinth. There are so many interconnecting corridors. Even one who has worked there for many years do not know its secrets! It is absolutely serpentine!
Most of the unplanned designs are simple insertions between the well planned building complexes, and now it has become really difficult to distinguish between the original and subsequent additions. Most of the present buildings display characteristics which are alien to the concept and master plan of the original building. This is because, as the number of papers grew and the organization grew in terms of logistics. Additions had to be made and hence the intersecting corridors and the various offices situated in the heart of the building. It is very difficult to anticipate/ pre design for a rapidly expanding newspaper company with new publications. I mean the Daily News is 100 years old today. Just think then and now! The company has grown rapidly, Manawadu expressed.
The building was completed/ inaugurated in 1929. Originally The Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited (ANCL) was incorporated in 1926 and was accommodated in a hired villa in Maradana. Commencement of the new building was subsequent to that, and therefore the Lake House building could be considered as a custom designed building for the newspaper company. The building was built in very prime land.
The main building has a touch of a great architect. The technology and construction dates back to the Colonial era. It can certainly stand for many years. There are no major defects in the main building despite being subjected to heavy traffic and the railway, stated Manawadu.
There was a certain vision behind the construction of Lake House. The vision behind the designing of the building is to accommodate the main functions of the newspaper company with nationalistic thinking. So the architecture of the building has taken this into consideration.
The designing of Lake House was not done all at once. Based on the requirements it has been developing over the years. Some of the additions were planned. Others were unplanned and chaotic. We were involved in preparing a Master Plan. We prepared a measured drawing which indicates how most of the buildings were added unplanned. However there is one good aspect which is the hap-hazardous developments are at the rear wings, and at lower elevations, and thus cannot be seen from D.R. Wijewardena Mawatha. Thus the value of the building and the architectural characteristics are preserved well, Manawadu pointed out.
There were some prestigious buildings in the vicinity of Lake House which were designed by Colonial architects either from England or India. However in the building of Lake House the architect has taken the challenge to design a building with a truly nationalistic concept.
In the history of Lake House, there have been many refurbishments and most of them unplanned. There was a recent program to refurbish the building, bringing back its glorious past. However that was interrupted abruptly, said Manawadu.
Lake House is a seriously large place! One would think that creating the piping systems and electricity for this large building would have been a mammoth task. Yet Manawadu pointed out that at the time of the founding of the building, it was a large building and the technology and planning infrastructure facilities were not that sophisticated.
However since it had been planned by a renowned architect, who had overseas experience and education, it was handled quite well, stated Manawadu.

President Maithripala Sirisenas Message
Journalism close to my heart
It has been almost fifty years since I began my professional career as a provincial correspondent at Dinamina, the Sinhala language sister-paper of the Daily News.
Having written to newspapers from my childhood up until the time I entered politics, I feel personally proud to congratulate the Daily News as it marks its 100th anniversary as Sri Lankas English-language newspaper of record.
Having written as a journalist during a period that saw a civil insurrection, the birth of a new Constitution, and the inception of the national struggle against terrorism, I have a special appreciation for the role of a vibrant national media espousing a diverse range of views that form the basis of informed public debate on all issues of national importance.
While our vision of a clean and disciplined nation cannot be fulfilled should journalists feel cowed or intimidated into blindly supporting the government of the day, I believe that a national newspaper plays a critical role in ensuring that the citizens of Sri Lanka can reach informed opinions in the public debates that impact their lives and the lives of our children.
This is a responsibility that I am proud to say that the Daily News has fulfilled with conscience and dignity under the stewardship of its current editorial team and management, and I encourage them wholeheartedly to continue to hold the interest of their readers above all others. In times of challenge, we must never forget the memories of those Sri Lankans who have sacrificed their lives in service to this sacred duty, and our own duty to honour them by ensuring their sacrifice was not in vain.

Journalism when terrorism reigned in Sri Lanka
I have been part of the Daily News team for the past ten years. However, being a news editor (last 2 plus years) has spoiled the discovery thrills I earlier had as a reporter.
The writers job is not to look through the window someone else built, but to step outside, to question the framework, or dismantle the house and free whats inside, all in service of making visible what was locked out of the view the guy from the 'Bamba' flats Buddy Guneratne told me while editing my first news feature based on a trip to the then war ravaged east in 2006.
As a rookie reporter, then, I kept Buddys inspiring words close to my heart and tried to follow his advice as much as possible, when both the newspaper and my conscience allowed it.
Journalism, provided me with valuable insights into how the world turns, how power works and how the powerful tick, political power games, social issues and how disputes arise and play out.
Starting with checking vegetable prices at the Manning Market in Pettah on my first day at the Daily News, I have gone on to cover almost all areas in the news section, affairs of the President, Prime Minister, Courts, Parliament, economy, political and foreign affairs, the war etc.
As Samangie Wettimuny, our features editor has asked me to concentrate a bit more about my experiences related to war reporting for this article, I thought I will start with that subject.
Memories of War
Although I have spent a considerable time in the war front, the most suited person to write about the war for the Daily News left us forever a few months back. The late Ranil Wijeyapala, our former defense correspondent spent months at a stretch at the war front in the company of the likes of our photo journalist Rukmal Gamage. If Ranil was alive today he would no doubt have written a comprehensive article about the war for this centenary supplement.
It was my former Editor Bandula Jayasekera who sent me on my first mission to the war front in May 2006, just one month after I joined this great newspaper. I was asked to go to Trincomalee where tensions had mounted with a series of conflicts following the construction of a Buddha statue in the midst of the town.
One of my first sightings when I approached the conflict-ridden area was a scared looking boy (close to 10 years) clutching the gate of a School and looking forlornly at the oncoming vehicles. However, the gate and a small fence was the only thing which was standing in that School premises as all other buildings had been erased to the ground, a result of the ongoing battle. War reporting has changed my thinking and perception of life. I have seen firsthand how war adds on human misery, the bravery some people show when faced against extreme odds, supreme sacrifices, and others who seek petty mileage at the expense of peoples anguish.
When it comes to the military and the media the question here arises, who needs whom Military wants to win the war and the media wants to tell the story. Does the media need the military or does the military need the media
Answer to this question is not that simple. Disputes and clashes are inevitable. Both the media and the military have been at the receiving end due to such disputes during the war. However, on my part, I found out during the conflict that the military handled the media matters quite satisfactorily. I cannot remember the military barring us unnecessarily from going places in the two provinces where the battle was raging those days. As a national newspaper, we have tried to cover the war while respecting our boundaries and responsibilities. On the question of military vs media, the military, too will benefit immensely due to the media as it plays a pivotal role in shaping public perception during a period of war. During the three-decade war against LTTE terror, the media it must be said played a pivotal role in galvanizing support for the military effort.
Suffering of Innocents in War
The sufferings of people during the war period were immense. Some of these which I witnessed remain as lasting memories. I still vividly remember my visit to the strategically important Vakarai soon after the military regained the area from the LTTE in early 2007. My first sighting after crossing the make shift bridge built by the Army across the lagoon, as the original one was completely destroyed by the fleeing tigers was a group of small girls waving for our vehicle to stop. They were hiding something in their slightly inverted frocks. When we went close, they took out what they were hiding - small prawns which they had caught from the lagoon using their frocks. They were trying to sell it to us. Tears sprang to my eyes, the oldest among the group may have been 7 years old.
The war has been especially harsh on children and women. I have seen elder children trying to teach younger ones at School as there were no teachers in some war ravaged areas. When I visited some eastern areas soon after they were liberated from the LTTE, a strange sight greeted me. There were rows of foreign liquor bottles placed on wooden tables in front of some makeshift houses with mostly women sitting behind them. As soon as a vehicle approached, they tried to stop them in a bid to sell their liquor. These they said had been gifted by some NGOs working in the area. Fortunately for them, there were no excise officers in those areas during the time to stop them engaging in their business. I still vividly remember going to cover the first cabinet of ministers meeting at former LTTE administrative capital at Kilinochchi on July 14, 2010. Following the meeting of the ministers, a meeting was held for the public in the area under the patronage of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The meeting was held at the Kilinochchi ground and seating arrangements were in place for the large gathering of public. The former Prime Minister D. M. Jayaratne was one of the first to arrive at the meeting and he went to each and every row of seated people to greet them. However, the people who had been under the LTTE clutches for the past 30 years did not recognize the person who was greeting them with a broad smile and a warm handshake. A handful of people who had recognized him were trying to tell the others that it was the Prime Minister of the country, but they were a very small minority and did not have much impact. This brought me the realization to what extent the LTTE had controlled the public and kept them in the dark while under their control.
The war coverage of ours was not confined to the North and East and it was very much alive in Colombo as well. The Capital was under constant attack by terrorists and especially suicide bombers. This writer was in close proximity when a female suicide bomber blew herself up at the Fort railway station on February 3, 2008 where several baseball players from the D. S. Senanayake College, Colombo were among the victims. The following is a part of a news feature this writer wrote for the next day's paper under the headline;
Abominable terror that snatched young lives in their prime
Date: February 3, 2008
Location: Colombo Fort Railway Station
Time: 2.10 p.m
The highly active Fort Railway station is somewhat deserted with an extended weekend holiday in the offing. It is unnaturally calm in this normally busy transport hub. On this lazy Sunday afternoon, gun totting security personnel at every entry/exit point remind the travelers of the troubled times they are going through.
Security has been beefed up and troops are on red alert, with Sri Lanka at the doorstep of another landmark in its annals, in the form of their 60th independence anniversary which is to be flagged off with a grand celebration in a few hours.
Sixty years since the struggle by our forefathers to gain freedom from the clutches of colonial rulers, another struggle is being waged, this time to free the nation from the clutches of terrorism.
In this backdrop the Fort Railway station and the general area resembles a mini fortress with armed guards at every nook and corner. The time is 2.05 p.m, the train from Kandy arrives at the station and among the crowd are seven young baseball players and their coach from D. S. Senanayake college in Colombo, returning after a club match in Kandy.
There are heavy bags on their backs and menacing looking baseball bats in their hands. The young men in the prime of their lives move to the exit point, at the corner of the number three platform, laughing and joking with each other.
They either did not see or did not take any notice of, a young woman who had a deadly secret: a suicide jacket strapped to her waist. In their eyes, she could have been just another passenger waiting to disembark. But she had no plan of ever going home.
The big clock overhead turns to 2.10, and stops its tick, tick as crows are the first ones to take flight in unison with the sound of the deadly blast, sending its shock waves on unsuspecting, innocent bystanders.
The clock which stopped at 2.10 p.m would be repaired in the near future and its hands would weave back and forth once again. But those young hearts which stopped ticking at 2.10 p.m on February 3, 2008, would never tick again. The life journey they began with so much hope and dreams is shattered so cruelly, on the concrete floor of a railway station to appease the blood lust of terrorists.
Heroic sacrifices
Some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference in the world. I am sure that our men and women in their uniforms do not have such a question to raise in their lives.
Thousands of the nations sons and daughters have served honourably, wearing our nations military uniforms. Of those, many have made the ultimate sacrifice with their lives, and have been wounded for life in combat, in defence of freedom. From the former Defence Minister RanjanWijeratne, General Denzil Kobbekaduwa to Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and numerous other leaders of our nation have made untold sacrifices for the freedom of the nation. Their service and sacrifice should be never forgotten by the media.
The Daily News - Next Stage
When I look around Daily News I see three kinds of people  those who hate their work, and complain bitterly, those who just tolerate their work and see it as a paycheck and arent looking for more, and finally, those who love their work, and relish it. I hope the third category keeps growing at a time when the Daily News completes 100 years and looks forward to scoring another century.

Kirama Divisional Hospital short of staff, facilities
The Kirama Divisional Hospital is currently facing various shortages.
According to hospital sources, there is an acute shortage of doctors, nurses, and minor staff at this hospital, and there is no place to keep the deceased.
The bodies have to be kept in the wards besides patients, until they are removed by the kith and kin of the deceased.
The well from which drinking water is pumped to the hospital also remains polluted. There are no facilities to perform postmortems, and as such, bodies have to be transferred to the Katuwana and Walasmulla Hospitals.
The hospital has no proper kitchen; cooking is done in a small hut that is similar to a cattle shed.
Most of the above above facilities are not provided to a central dispensary. This hospital was previously a central unit, but as it is now a divisional hospital, it needs a proper mortuary.
Plans are underway from the World Bank in order to allocate funds to set up a mortuary and kitchen.

Market leader Maruti Suzuki and Honda Cars posted double-digit growth in domestic sales last month compared with a year earlier, while the increase for Hyundai Motors was marginal. On the other hand, Mahindra & Mahindra saw a decline of 7% in sales of passenger vehicles in December, which is considered to be a relatively slower month for the auto industry as people prefer to buy vehicles registered in the new year.
Maruti Suzuki India sold more than 1.18 lakh passenger vehicles in the country during the last month, a growth of 11.4% from the more than 1.06 lakh units sold in December 2016. The company also sold in excess of 700 units of its light commercial vehicle Super Carry and exported 10,780 vehicles, taking the total sales in December 2017 to more than 1.30 lakh units, a growth of 10.3% year-on-year. However, the exports declined by a little over 6% from 11,494 units.
In a statement, the company said sales of mini segment cars, which include the Alto and the WagonR, grew 2% to 32,146 units during December, while sales of its mid-sized sedan Ciaz declined by almost 36% to 2,382. Sales of compact vehicles (Swift, Ritz, Celerio, Ignis, Baleno, Dzire and Tour S) grew 23% to 53,336 units, while those of utility vehicles (Gypsy, Ertiga, Vitara Brezza and S-Cross) rose 19.9% to 19,276 units. Sales of vans (Omni and Eeco) increased by 23.8% to 11,420 units in the last month.
December sales for Hyundai Motor India, which recorded its highest annual domestic sales in 2017, rose marginally. It sold 40,158 vehicles in December 2017, compared with 40,057 units in the year-earlier period.
The calendar year 2017 has been a year of performance ... registering highest-ever domestic volume of 5,27,320 units, a growth of 5.4%, helped by the positive momentum in urban and rural retail sales, along with strong after-sales service and low-cost of ownership, YK Koo, MD & CEO, Hyundai Motor India said. Its exports rose 32.9% to 22,741 units in the month, taking total monthly sales to 62,899, a growth of 10%. The Hindu News

Mathews to be handed back ODI captaincy
The national selectors are seriously considering bringing back all-rounder Angelo Mathews as captain of the Sri Lanka one-day international team for the upcoming tri-nation one-day series in Bangladesh starting later this month.
We have been discussing it but we have not finalised anything yet, said chief selector Graeme Labrooy.
At the same time we have not ruled out Thisara Perera the present captain either. We also have two other contenders for the captaincy. We dont want to rush it right now but give enough time for the new coach Chandika Hathurusingha to spend with the players, he said.
Although according to the Sports Law Hathurusingha cannot be part of the national selection committee provisions can be made to value his input and according to the SLC constitution he can be appointed to be part of the group when finalising the playing eleven.
Mathews has led Sri Lanka in 98 ODIs winning 47 and losing 45.
Mathews at present is recovering from a hamstring tear that he sustained during the second T20 international against India at Indore on December 22 and is expected to undergo a fitness test on January 7.
Along with him leg-spinner Jeffrey Vandersay will also undergo a fitness test the same day after straining a thigh muscle playing for SSC in a Premier league match.
We are selecting the team on January 5 and if these two players are picked their inclusion will be subject to them successfully getting through the fitness test on January 7, said Labrooy.
Labrooy stated that the squad will be picked with replacements for Mathews and Vandersay.
Mathews resigned as captain across all three formats following Sri Lankas stunning 2-3 ODI series loss to Zimbabwe in July last year that prompted him to make the remark, It's one of the lowest points in my career, and a hard one to swallow."
Mathews resignation left Sri Lanka without a proper leader in the ODI format and resulted in the team being captained by four players Upul Tharanga, Chamara Kapugedera, Lasith Malinga and Thisara Perera at different times resulting in 12 losses and one win in their last 13 ODIs.
Labrooy also stated that Mathews role as a bowler has also to be seriously discussed.
Mathews has continued to suffer injuries to his leg whenever takes on the task of bowling in one-day matches and as a result the team has lost out on his experience as a top order batsman.
Mathews playing as an all-rounder balances the team nicely, but if he is to be played only as a batsman he will have to fight for his place with the other top batters in the side, said Labrooy. The Sri Lanka team is due to leave for Bangladesh on January 13 and participate in a one-day tri-nation tournament with Bangladesh and Zimbabwe starting on January 17 before moving on to play a series of two Tests and two T20 internationals.

MCG pitch rated as poor
The International Cricket Council yesterday announced that the pitch for the fourth Test between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground has been rated as poor under the ICC Pitch and Outfield Monitoring Process.
ICC Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle submitted his report to the ICC expressing the concerns of the match officials over the performance of the pitch which saw Australia scoring 327 and 263 for four declared, and England scoring 491 in their only innings.
This report has been forwarded to Cricket Australia, who now have 14 days to provide their response.
Madugalle said: The bounce of the MCG pitch was medium, but slow in pace and got slower as the match progressed. The nature of the pitch did not change over the five days and there was no natural deterioration. As such, the pitch did not allow an even contest between the bat and the ball as it neither favoured the batsmen too much nor it gave the bowlers sufficient opportunity to take wickets.
The MCG Test was the last Test to be rated under the current ICC Pitch and Outfield Monitoring Process, with a revised process coming into effect in mens and womens international cricket from Thursday, 4 January 2018, following the conclusion of the New Zealand versus Windies T20I series which ends in Mount Maunganui on Wednesday.
The major change in the revised ICC Pitch and Outfield Monitoring Process is to the sanctioning system for venues which present substandard conditions for international matches. If a pitch or outfield is rated as being substandard, that venue will be allocated a number of demerit points.
One demerit point will be awarded to venues whose pitches are rated by the match referees as below average, while three and five demerit points will be awarded to venues whose pitches are marked as poor and unfit, respectively.
When a venue accumulates five demerit points, it will be suspended from hosting any international cricket for a period of 12 months, while a venue will be suspended from staging any international cricket for 24 months when it reaches the threshold of 10 demerit points. Demerit points will remain active for a rolling five-year period.

NCE calls on state research institutes  to play direct role in NES
National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) President Ramal Jasinghe called on state research institutes to move out of their comfort zones and play a direct role in the national export strategy.
Jasinghe said that while public research institutes such as the Industrial Technology Institute are doing good work, their present research focus is on local industry. However, as Sri Lankas is an export-driven economy, these research institutes have a pivotal role to play in the strategic vision the government has for export growth, viz., Sri Lanka as an export hub driven by innovation and investment. "Thus far, it has largely been the private sector which has undertaken research for the exports sector, buoyed by tax concessions offered."
Innovation and R&D
Commending the ongoing effort of the Ministry of Development Strategies and Industrial Trade and the Export Development Board to chart a national export strategy (NES), he underscored the need for innovation and research and development (R&D), which is where the research institutes have a positive role to play. "At present, there isn't sufficient research into the markets to which we plan to export."
The NCE President said innovation and R&D need to focus on the six priority sectors that the NES has identified, viz., ICT, wellness tourism, spice concentrates, boat building, processed foods and beverages and electronics, electrical goods and machinery.
Innovation and R&D is in fact one of four trade support functions (TSFs) that the NES steering committee has outlined to sustain and grow the priority sectors, the other three of which are national quality infrastructure, logistics and trade promotion.
A small state like Sri Lanka faces issues of scale which must be countered with the uniqueness of quality of its products such as tea and spices, Jasinghe went on say. We need to exploit the positives of our tea and spices and other products and be innovative in our agricultural and marketing practices to seize global opportunities which would otherwise be lost.
Our cinnamon, for instance, is perhaps the worlds best. Some countries are marketing a cinnamon substitute, cassia, which is however known to be carcinogenic. We need to use such market information to effectively counter competition and sell our products.He said an innovative approach to export growth would cater to market trends such as the present global demand for ethnic foods. "Market trends could impact us positively or negatively and we need to be geared for that."
Marketing
Underlining the need for using the tools of marketing to develop the exports sector, Jasinghe said, at present, although Sri Lanka has enviable marketing brains among academics and professionals, market information in the exports sector is sadly at a low level and is not organized. The resources of the marketing dons in academia and professional bodies need to be mobilized to ascertain the marketing mix and best strategies and tactics for value chain development in the exports sector.
Strategies in the export sector should dovetail on a national export and branding strategy which in turn should be built in line with Vision 2025.
Jasinghe also said that any effort towards growing the economy cannot be undertaken solely by the government or solely by the private sector; it has to be a public-private partnership such as the current 'think tank' on the NES.
FTAs and para-tariffs
"Thus far, we are happy that the state has been engaging and listening to exporters. We don't want any surprises because at the end of the day we need to protect our entrepreneurs, our farmers and our manufacturers."
Referring to the free trade agreements (FTAs) the government is negotiating with some countries, Jasinghe said the NCE is happy that protection will be afforded by the proposed anti-dumping legislation.
He also said that although an FTA may allow certain exports, the laws and regulations of a particular state in the other country may hinder their entry into that state. "Such non-tariff barriers need to be addressed right at the start."
Further, regarding the relaxing of para-tariffs, Jasinghe said thus far they have had no untoward issues. "We are not asking for a cess to be retained forever. But if the government is taking off a cess, we request that it be done gradually, to give that particular industry sufficient time to adjust to the market and grow."
Infrastructure
The NCE President said Sri Lanka needed the requisite infrastructure to drive the national export vision and power generation was one such sector which needed urgent development.
Export growth also needs to be driven by sustainable initiatives and NCE is part of the efforts of the National Cleaner Production Centre to ensure globally accepted sustainable manufacturing practices that will in turn ensure that Sri Lankan exports have continued access and acceptance in international markets.
Human resources
Speaking of Sri Lanka's future human resources development, he said today's youth are drawn to becoming 'tuk tuk' drivers because of the relatively easy method of earning a good income. "This is largely a result of a lack of skills development and vocational training, right from school level."
"The Ceylon-German Technical Training Institute in Moratuwa used to attract a number of youth, many of whom are now abroad. Likewise, the National Diploma in Technology was an attractive qualification to possess. Now the 'tuk tuk' is the biggest threat to Sri Lanka's ensuring it has technically skilled manpower."
"The NCE has taken up this issue with government ministers who agree there is a problem."
"We need a concerted strategy to restore the dignity of the blue collar job and the cultivator as well. We need to show youth there is power in such professions."
He said as workers' remittances to Sri Lanka have been dropping, Sri Lankans returning from the Middle East should be channelled to entrepreneurship or the manufacturing and export sectors.
Summing up
Jasinghe said a holistic view of the national export strategy is necessary where all stakeholders and every citizen of Sri Lanka participates.
"For instance, we are working on a project with the ILO which brings the cultivators of the North with the entrepreneurs of the South. We hope to replicate this inclusion in other provinces creating cross-province engagement in the exports sector."
He said such initiatives are or will be funded by the ILO, ITC and foreign governments.
As opposed to say five years ago, there is now inclusion, an open environment and room for discussion and disagreement on national economic issues which are essential milestones for development.

NCP gets special ayurveda centres to treat kidney diseases
A special kidney disease treatment centre and a clinic will be set up this year at every ayurveda hospital in the North Central Province.

Bandara, Provincial Health Secretary Saman Bandulasena, and Provincial Ayurvedic Commissioner Dr. Kumara Alwis.The centres will treat patients in accordance with the ayurveda treatment methodology being used at the CKDu Care Project Clinic and Treatment Unit that has healed CKDu (Chronic Kidney Diseases of Uncertain Aetiology) patients and other types of renal ailments during the past two years. Western and Ayurveda doctors led by Dr. Nishantha Kumarasinghe, a senior lecturer at the Kotelawala Defence University will monitor the projects.
The treatment methodology has been taken from ancient prescriptions that Dr. Kumarasinghe inherited from the late Ven. Waharaka Abhayarathanalankada Thera, a renowned ayurveda physician. Dr. Kumarasinghe highlighted the bona fide of the medicine at a recently held meeting in the province.
He said the same would be introduced to the 45 ayurveda hospitals and Provincial Ayurveda Commissioner Dr. Kumara Alwis would coordinate the programme. Provincial Health Secretary Saman Bandulasena said the treatment would be promoted assisted by Dr. Nishantha Kumarasinghe and his colleagues.
The Padaviya, Rambewa and Anuradhapura Ayurveda General Hospitals and the Thambuttegama Thelhiriyawa Provincial Ayurveda Drugs Manufacturing Plant were entrusted to produce medicine using 23 rare herbs and other ingredients.
The project will cost Rs. 2.5 million apart from the infrastructural aspect, the Provincial Health Secretary said.

Negative impact on apparel  exports to USA unlikely
Sri Lankan apparel exports will not be negatively affected by the expiry of the United States Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program for Sri Lanka and other GSP beneficiary countries.
The expiration of the program will not have any negative impact on Sri Lankan apparel exports to the US, since local apparel exports are not eligible to receive the US GSP concessions, The Joint Apparel Association Forum Former Secretary General Tuley Cooray told Daily News Business.
The U.S. Embassy in Colomboin a statement said, United States Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program for Sri Lanka and other GSP beneficiary countries will expire on December 31 after which exports will be subjected to non-preferential duties.
The United States Congress did not re-authorize GSP before adjourning for the year. The immediate effect of GSP expiration is GSP eligible imports to the United States from Sri Lanka and other GSP beneficiary countries and territories will be subject to non-preferential duties beginning January 1, 2018, the Embassy said
According to Cooray, other products, exported by Sri Lanka under the US GSP scheme will experience some sort of negative impact if the scheme is not extended to Sri Lanka again. This is not a new or unusual scenario; people make contradictory views when there is a delay in granting the concession. In the meantime, National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Affairs Dr Harsha de Silva said that the expiration of US GSP concessions cannot be expected to make a significant impact to Sri Lankas exports to the US, especially given the countrys concentrated export basket.
Sri Lankas apparel exports to EU have increased by only 2% from January to September 2016 in comparison to the same period in 2015. As a result of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes efforts, after receiving EU GSP Plus, Sri Lankas apparel exports to EU from January to September this year compared the same period last year at US $ 1.5 billion, has increased by a huge 11.3% to US $ 1.67 billion.
Even though US market is not connected to EU GSP, Sri Lankasapparel exports to US too has increased this year by 12% to $ 1.8 billion during the periodJanuary to September.

New State Minister pledges to render yeoman service
The newly sworn-in Law and Order and Southern Development State Minister Piyasena Gamage, requested the support of the ministry staff to render a great service to the country in 2018, in accordance with the wishes of the good governance government.
He added that President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, as the pioneers of the good governance government, expect the maintenance of peace in the country and the development of the South.
The President insisted that I look into the development of the Galle district since Minister Sagala Ratnayaka could attend to the Matara district development, State Minister Gamage said.
He made these observations yesterday morning after assuming duties at the Ministry in Suhurupaya.
He said he was pleased to work with Minister Ratnayaka since they were friends coming from the adjoining villages of Deniyaya and Hiniduma in the Southern Province. He added that he got a great opportunity to serve the people under the President and Prime Ministers good governance government after being neglected as a senior minister during the previous government.
He said after he swore-in as a Member of Parliament on November 10, the President instructed him to work as the State Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development.
I was reluctant as it was a State Ministry and requested to remain as a member for some time, said State Minister Gamage.
But later, he insisted me to take over a responsibility and take over this State Ministerial Portfolio. Then I took over last Thursday.
Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, Deputy Minister Nishantha Muthuhettigama, Provincial Councillor Randima Gamage, Law and Order and Southern Development State Ministry Secretary Pathmasiri Jayamanna, IGP Pujith Jayasundra also participated.

No political influence in future, Govt. assures CBSL
The government has given an assurance to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka that there would be no political influence over any of its functional responsibilities, Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy yesterday said.
Dr. Coomaraswamy was speaking at a press brief held at the CBSL premises yesterday evening.
Responding to a question on the delay of the regulatory performance by the Central Bank over certain matters, Dr. Coomaraswamy said most of its failures are not a fault of the institution, but the prolonged political influence over it.
Often in this country, delays are caused by political factors interfering into the workings of the authorities. That had happened in the past, which we have pointed out, Dr. Coomaraswamy said.
We have been criticized for our regulatory performances. We have made a point that the main problem was not the CBSL regulations. In response to that, we were told that politics would not be a problem anymore and that we should go ahead and do our work, he pointed out.
Asked when this reassurance was given, Dr. Coomaraswamy said that they received it Over the last four or five months.

Digital payments, digital data, digital customer service,  payments through new  platform, along with real-time  analytics are becoming entrenched in the  World Economy
Paving  the way  for a  Digital  Economy
The new Economy have greatly changed our economic environment in relation to how the government and businesses operate and provide goods and services and the structure of the labour force.Prosperity in the new economy involves more than capitalizing on knowledge assets. Prosperity involves increasing employment in those industries that are growing.
Digital payments, digital data, digital customer service, payments through new platform, along with real-time analytics are becoming entrenched in the world economy.
These elements will forever change consumption from because of the effects of many governments push towards a cashless economy. Little over a year ago India in an effort to move to and combat corruption, tax evasion and counterfeiting, all 500 and 1,000 rupee banknotes were withdrawn from circulation. Many international bankers argue that India failed miserably in their demonetization effort.
The Modi governments publicly declared demonetization objectives publicly was that the government wanted to transform the economy into a digital economy. We know we cannot completely transform an economy to a digital economy over night, there are various social classes, example a waiter or steward receive tips, a household worker gets some extra money for a job well-done, parliamentarians get political funds, even some professionals have foundations to earn their donations and sales from books, parliamentarians or politicians have their own Foundations established to get donations and then Politicians partly use those money to uplift certain communities, even clergy use money they receive to uplift social standards of communities and to look into the welfare of them, if you take an establishment such as the Roman Catholic Church it has over US $ 60 billion real estate assets around the globe in the name of Church Lands, Missionary Schools that was purchased from the money that they got from Devotees which went to clergy and The Vatican. Just imagine what happens if Citizen Fernando has to donate money by a mobile app that sometimes is not even properly working to transfer money to a temple, kovil, or church, or even a mosque. There will be hell to pay all round.
Demonetization
In the Indian Demonetization effort, If the real objective was to attack black money, stored by the political and business elite it has failed. Around ninety percent of the demonetized notes were returned to the banks, far more than the government expected. This means, as the Guardian explained, with its sense of British understatement, that either the Indians concealed less wealth from taxation than was thought, or that money has been preserved in the form of goods or gold rather than cash. In fact, according to economists, very probably less than three percent of black money is held in currency. In an Indian context it is still big money. Almost all of it is either converted into gold (it is said India has by far the largest private gold reserves in the world), or put into purchases of jewellery, real estate, or land, when it is not put into financial investments.
Then when all that money goes into their bank accounts or other establishments that money too comes to the so called White system... Gambling (Casinos) is said to be one of the world's biggest industries that create wealth among various social classes and there Gambling Moguls around the world who own Banks, Finance Companies, Real Estate, even in USA there are poker players who become rich overnight and then their wealth transfer into various other establishments when they start using that money. One such example is a spa owner their extra earnings transform to various other business establishments when they purchase goods and services.
Drive away
A full digital economy can drive away lots of people and perhaps increase the poverty if digital transformation is done by creating limitations and wealth limits, although India implemented practices of demonetization if you watched NDTV and other TV News, listened to Indian Radio in the last few months you will clearly understand that certain new gray economical activities started as a result of the moves, there were Indian banker families or officials, new brokers who started taking thousands of Indian rupees worth Kick-Backs from common people to deposit the money under various other names and newly created accounts in India as there were new taxes for deposit limits. Many people faced identity theft as a result too, India being the world's largest democracy has the most business savvy politicians, but even they are people who transform wealth to various other business, religious and social establishments.
Mass adoption
Several top Economists have said globally that what India did was a failure and it only hugely troubled poor families and specially older people's savings. India is the largest Gold consumer and India's activity in impacting Global Gold Prices took a different turn because of Demonetization, it enabled the digital currencies such as Bitcoin to overtake the Gold price in international markets in the last three months and even if you take Bitcoin, people trade in those digital currencies and their capital gains are transformed to other asset classes in the real world finally resulting in the real economy losing. Banks and companies will need to work with each other dynamically along with using digital payments. They can help many small SMEs with digital payments and to crunch stock-keeping data over the cloud.
This can enable SMEs to raise working capital loans from banks and the country who can benefit from going digital. Every Businessman has a smartphone and only needs technology to be proliferated through marketing. The problem is discovery today. The next three years will see a mass adoption of digital technologies. However, though digital technologies are spreading across the globe, many people in the country still do not have access to the Internet.

Peru Pasamayo: Dozens killed as coach plunges off cliff

At least 36 people have been killed after a coach plummeted 100m (330ft) down a cliff and landed upside down on a beach in Peru, officials say.
The health ministry said six survivors had so far been pulled from the wreckage and taken to hospital.
The accident happened on a notorious stretch of road known as Curva del Diablo (the devil's bend) in Pasamayo, north of the capital Lima.
A transport official said the coach was carrying about 50 people.
The winding Pacific Ocean road is considered one of the most dangerous in Peru.
Peru's President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski said it was "painful for the whole country to suffer an accident of this magnitude".
He sent a message of "deep solidarity" to the families of the victims.
Images from the scene showed rescuers surrounding the wrecked coach while people on the road above looked on.
Peru transport chief Dino Escudero said an investigation had been launched but it appeared that the coach had been in collision with another vehicle, causing the driver to lose control.
A helicopter was helping in the rescue operation.
The coach had been travelling to Lima from Huacho, about 130km (80 miles) north of the capital.
Correspondents say road accidents are common in Peru. In 2016, 493 people were killed in more than 3,800 accidents, according to official figures.

Policeman killed in Iran protests
IRAN: Fresh protests broke out as night fell in Iran Monday with reports of a policeman shot dead, as the authorities moved to crack down on days of unrest across the country.
There was a heavy police presence in Tehran as small groups of protesters ran through the city centre shouting anti-regime slogans, local agencies reported.
Some arrests were made before calm returned to the capital, reports said.
State television said one policeman had been killed and three others wounded by fire from hunting rifles in the city of Najafabad in central Iran.
The latest demonstrations came despite President Hassan Rouhanis vow that the nation would deal with rioters and lawbreakers.
Media cited Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Irans Supreme National Security Council, as blaming the violence on social media.
Hashtags and messages about the situation in Iran come from the United States, Britain and Saudi Arabia, he said.
What is happening on social networks concerning the situation in the country is a proxy war against the Iranian people.
US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticised Tehran over four days of demonstrations, said it was time for a change and that Irans people were hungry for freedom.
Irans intelligence ministry released a statement saying rioters and instigators have been identified and will be dealt with seriously soon.
The Revolutionary Guards published photos of three wanted people and called on the public to report any seditionist elements.
The deadliest night yet was on Sunday, with state television reporting six people killed by gunfire in the western town of Tuyserkan, and a local lawmaker saying two people had been shot dead in the southwestern town of Izeh.
Two others, including a teenage boy, were run down and killed by a fire engine protesters stole in the western town of Dorud, the state broadcaster said. The total death toll linked to the protests currently stands at 13. Rouhani tried to play down the unrest, which began in second city Mashhad last Thursday and quickly spread across the country to become the biggest test for the regime since mass protests in 2009.
This is nothing, Rouhani said in a statement on the presidency website. Our nation will deal with this minority who chant slogans against the law and peoples wishes, and insult the sanctities and values of the revolution.
Pro-regime rallies were held across several towns and cities.
Reporting restrictions remained tight, but videos on social media showed seemingly widespread anti-government protests, with attacks on government buildings and a school for clergy in the northwestern town of Takestan on Sunday. - AFP

The 533-metre long Rajagiriya flyover construction commenced on April 19, 2016 and it cost Rs. 4,514 million. Rajagiriya is the main entry point to the Colombo City and its suburbs, Kollupitiya, Welikada, Nawala and Borella.
A huge traffic congestion was evident during the office hours wasting man hours of working people, loosing billions of rupees of income to the Gross National Product, he said.
The 883 metre-long Polgahawela flyover cost Rs.2,203 million. It will greatly benefit Polgahawela and Kurunagala (A 19) road users.
The town is the entry point to a number of cities.
It comprises a two-lane carriageway and two pedestrian ways on either side. The 504-meter long Ganemulla flyover cost Rs 1,768 million. Around 87 trains travelling to and from Colombo, Badulla, Kandy, Jaffna, Trincomolee, Mannar and Batticaloa pass the Ganemulla railway station causing the closure of the rail gates as frequently as 90 times per day resulting severe traffic congestions. "After the flyovers are commissioned, the long standing problem will be resolved," he said.

## Title: Serendib Horticulture makes key  contribution to emerging export product sector

Serendib Horticulture makes key  contribution to emerging export product sector
Serendib Horticulture Technologies (Pvt) Ltd, one of the leading horticulture companies in Sri Lanka, is looking to expand its local and global presence, sharing local knowhow and knowledge with foreign governments, while supporting agriculture research and export production in Sri Lanka.
Located in Kalagedihena in Gampaha, Serendib Horticulture Technologies is a leading company in plant bio-technology, where many varieties are produced through tissue culture technology.
The plants include ornamental plants, such as banana, pineapple, potato and strawberry and the company is committed to produce superior quality plants with timely delivery.
The company currently exports flowers, fruits and vegetable plants to Holland, Denmark, Japan, USA, Germany, South Korea, Bahrain, Qatar and UAE, etc.
In an interview with Daily News Business, Serendib Horticulture Technologies Chairman and CEO Dilip de Silva shared his views on the companys success story, its contribution towards the Sri Lankan exports sector, future plans, etc.
Q: What progress has been made by the company since inception in Sri Lanka and how has your brand been accepted by both local and international customers
When I took over the company from Ceylon Tobacco Company in 1999, its production was very small, something close to 300,000 plants per year. But over the years we expanded our markets and product range. In the first few years we participated in many exhibitions internationally and we had a very aggressive marketing strategy. That really paid off. I exposed some of my staff to international markets.
Q: What factors have contributed to the overall performance of the company over the years
The main contributory factor was the dedication of the staff. I have very experienced staff who have been with me through all the difficult periods we have faced. We need to be technically competent in addition to managerial competencies. Running a commercial tissue culture lab successfully is not as easy as one would think. A slight mistake can ruin your production. Its very sensitive to chemicals, temperature, etc. The staff have to be at it all the time. So its the staff, managerial competencies and aggressive marketing that contributed to the success of the company.
Q: What are your plans to expand the companys presence in the region Could you brief us on the companys upcoming and ongoing projects both at home and abroad as well as main exports markets
I had plans of expanding in Sri Lanka. But I have temporarily suspended them. This is because we are working on many international projects. The biggest project that is being done is in Rwanda where we will be setting up a tissue culture lab for approx. 2.0 million plants per year for a Rwandan company.
I had meetings with the investors, DG of the Department of Agriculture, CEO of the Rwandan Development Bank, Mayor, etc., on this project. Its amazing how very supportive the Rwandan government is for this project. This is a three-year project for us. During this period, we will establish the lab, train the staff and produce their requirement of fruit plants. Training will be done by my staff at Serendib. They will be in Rwanda for three-month periods. It would be great exposure for them as well.
The next project we have is in Iran, where we will transform an R&D facility into a commercial entity. This is a consultancy for one year. We will be starting this project this month. I'm happy as a Sri Lankan that we have been called by a country like Iran which is technically well advanced.
The next project we are working on is in Pakistan. Once again we will be setting up a tissue culture lab to produce their local fruits. This project is also supported by the government of Pakistan.
So, with all these projects, we are working to capacity.
Our main export markets are Holland, Japan, USA, Australia, Pakistan, Denmark, Rwanda, Iran, Germany and Korea. We have a very wide presence, except in Russia.
Q: How is the local horticulture industry faring in the current context
If you look around when travelling in the island, you will see many small flower shows. This implies that there is a lot of potential in the local market. People, mainly women, are getting more into the plant and flower business. This is a very good sign. But we need to see how we could sustain the industry. Most of the plants, especially orchids, that you see in the market are all imported from Thailand.
This is a trend we have to stop. For many years, orchids were allowed to be imported with coir fibre blocks. Bringing in coir products to Sri Lanka is banned due to our coconut industry. But they allowed orchid imports with coco chips. Look what has happened to the coconut industry in Sri Lanka. It has been devastated with various pests.
Coco chips could have very well been imported from Thailand with the orchids. After a lot of lobbying we have succeeded in allowing only bare rooted orchid plants to Sri Lanka with no coco chips. But if you go around and ask people who grow Thailand orchids, most would say that they die after 1-2 years or that they give deformed flowers. But if we are to stop this, we need to produce our own orchids. This is what the tissue culture labs in Sri Lanka should be trying to do. This is where government intervention is required.
Q: What challenges and opportunities do you see in the local horticulture industry What suggestions do you have for the betterment of the industry
Sri Lanka has a growing middle class. This means that people will have more disposable income. Sri Lankans are also very conscious about the environment and the greening concepts. Sri Lanka has very good potential for horticulture.
When we talk of horticulture, it includes fruits, vegetables and flowers. We need good planting material. This could be produced after indexing for diseases. Fruits such as banana, pineapple and strawberry could be produced on a mass scale through tissue culture.
We need to look at commercial cultivation models for exports as well as models where cooperative systems are worked out throughout grower schemes. This would generate more employment and the village economies would prosper.
Government agencies should support exporters in their endeavour to reach markets. Archaic regulations of import and exports should be looked into on a case by case basis. For example, my company has been striving for nearly three years to export an ornamental aquatic plant called Cryptocoryne which is produced through tissue culture.
This plant species is found all over the world. But our authorities say it is endangered and it is on the red list prohibiting the export. This has deprived my company and the country of hundreds of thousands of dollars in foreign exchange.
If the government institutes are more amenable to producers and exporters of horticulture products, most of the challenges could be overcome and the opportunities could be made into reality.
Q: Does your company continuously engage in innovating horticulture products and services and how has it impacted your overall business
Innovation in our company is through selection. We look at plants that could have an export potential and we develop the protocols for its propagation. Sometimes it could be just a plant or two that we may get. But we work on it and try to make it into a product that our markets would accept. Samples are then sent to the market to test its acceptability. Generally it takes about a year or two to get a positive feedback from the market. We have introduced several varieties to the global market through these innovations.
Q: In the face of global economic turmoil and civil unrest in various countries, fuel prices are going up. This has resulted in increased air transport charges. How would this impact the growth aspirations of the company in the near and mid-term
Increases in fuel prices will certainly have a negative impact on the market. Firstly, our production costs will go up and then the costs of our customers who have greenhouses which need heating will also have a higher bill to pay. We need to be very mindful about the cost. If the market is going to stagnate or decline, then expansion of business will have to be put on hold and we would concentrate on existing orders.
Q: In spite of invaluable contribution to economic growth, farmers in developing countries often lack tools, money and skills to respond to agricultural development changes. How do you view this 
Unfortunately, research and development has been very weak in Sri Lanka. This is not because we do not have researchers to carry out research but because they do not have a focus on application. Research should be focused on application. If a specific research application could result in a farmers yield increasing by a certain percentage, then its a research that's valuable. But unfortunately most research in Sri Lanka is done for the purpose of publishing papers. The good projects that are done are not continued to a commercial application stage. There is a gap between the researchers and the implementers. This has to be bridged if we are to come out with quality research.
Q: Deforestation is a global issue. How does a company like Serendib help fight deforestation
We have already identified the problem the country is facing regarding the loss of forest cover. We have identified a variety for which we have already developed the tissue culture protocol. We will soon be doing a pilot project in the dry zone. If permission is granted and accepted, it will make a great impact on the reforestation program. At this moment, I cannot reveal details of this project, but soon we will make it public.
Q: How does Serendib help build food security and nourish growth
We are working on staple crops for the government of Rwanda. At the moment, the stocks are being built up and by early next year the production will begin in Rwanda under our management.
Q: What trends and innovations can be identified in the horticulture industry both at home and abroad
Medicinal plants have a huge demand globally. The field of medicine is changing to drugs made of medicinal plant extracts. Sri Lanka is a bio-diversity hot spot. We have many plant species that have been used in our traditional medicine. Such remedies are being researched in many countries. This is an industry that we should focus on. We need to identify plant varieties with medicinal properties, develop protocols for propagation and cultivate them commercially. This field will have a growing demand during the next decade.
Q: How does your company make a responsible commitment to the wellbeing of the local farming community in Sri Lanka
We do a lot of propagation of banana, anthuriums, orchids, etc., for local farmers. Our responsibility does not end after we sell the plant.
We visit our farmers to inquire about the product and discuss any problems they have and collectively, we try to find solutions. This gives them a lot of encouragement to continue with their farming. We are working on expanding our engagement with the farming community we have developed over the last two years with increased production of the varieties they require.
Q What sort of investment plan does your company have in mind in Sri Lanka
There is a good demand in the future for horticulture in Sri Lanka. Expansion could be justified due to the increase in demand.
With the present responsibilities I have on overseas projects, it is difficult for me to handle them by myself. Hence I'm looking for an investor or investors to partner with me, to take this industry to a higher level. We now have the technology, markets and trained staff that could make a difference to the horticulture industry in Sri Lanka.

SLTA, first in South Asia to Digitize administration
The Sri Lanka Tennis Association announced a new tennis development initiative for 2018, which aims to completely automate the SLTA administration introducing a cloud accessed digitized platform for its stake holders.
The digitization process commenced on December 27 when SLTA President Iqbal Bin Issack inaugurated the SLTA Players Registration System at the SLTA Office.
The step taken by the SLTA is in keeping with the 2020 vision document of the International Tennis Federation (ITF), which aims to encourage its member National Federations bring in digitization of national sports structures, leading to better services.
Digitization of SLTA administration is the brain child of Suresh Subramaniam, Vice President of the SLTA who is also the Vice President of the Asian Tennis Federation (South Asia).
Having earlier served two successive terms in the Professional Tennis Committee of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and now serving his second successive term in the Juniors Committee, it was the vast experience and exposure of Suresh Subramaniam at the top most level of the game, which made him grab this opportunity for his organization.
This step has firmly established SL Tennis Association as the first sporting organization in the country to completely digitize every aspect of administration of the game.
Sri Lanka Tennis Association would also become the first tennis National Federation in South Asia, and second National Federation in entire Asia to have taken steps towards complete indigenous digitization of its administration.
Iqbal Bin Issack, President SLTA thanked his colleague and VP Subramaniam for putting SLTA firmly in the forefront of digitization program currently being observed in most developed sporting associations around the world. The digitization process in successive stages would completely automate the administration of the SLTA introducing the following, over the next year (to name a few).
1. SLTA Players Registration System, 2. Automated launch of SLTA Tennis Tour and SLTA Club Tennis Tournaments, 3. Online entry and withdrawal for players via their personal players zones, 4. Automated 52 Week Rolling Rankings (Updated every Monday), 5. Automatic Tournament Draws, 6. Live streaming of matches and scores on SLTA Website, 7.
New exciting formats of weekend tournaments for the junior and club circuits, 8. New digitized mobile compatible SLTA Website, offering ease of access, 9.

Media Minister Mangala Samaraweeras Message
Stood the test of time
I am honoured to extend my best wishes and gratitude to the staff and management of the Daily News, as they celebrate one hundred years of continuous publication, as Sri Lankas longest standing English language newspaper. Much has changed at the paper since the Daily News first came under my purview as Media Minister in 1997.
Over the last several years, the paper has transformed from Sri Lankas printed publication of record, into a multimedia powerhouse with a vibrant web site, apps for Android iOS and Windows Phone, and a fledgling online video arm. The Daily News stood the test of time, and has thrived in an era where newspaper circulation has decreased almost everywhere in the world except Sri Lanka, as more citizens consume their news through television and the Internet.
As venerable an accolade it is for The Daily News to have flourished over the past century, we stand united in taking the seeds of the late D.R.Wijewardenes vision of a trusted and ubiquitous source of detailed and accurate news reporting well into the 21st century, and indeed, centuries thereafter.
