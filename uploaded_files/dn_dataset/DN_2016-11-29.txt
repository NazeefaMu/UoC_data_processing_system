Charming and non-formulaic
If this past springs Zootopia saw Disney shake up its standard formula in service of what was more or less an unusually well-made crime procedural featuring cartoon animals, Moana sees the Mouse House working in a more traditional mold. And to the films credit, there are moments in which Moana feels just as fresh in different respects. Yet its a traditional kind of Disney movie, a whole-family crowd pleaser with a few earworms on its soundtrack and an endearing pair of mismatched leads on an impeccably animated adventure.
Even allowing for its recognizable traits, Moana is as much a treat to watch as any recent Disney outing. Despite ostensibly being a Disney princess film (more on that shortly), one of the films more immediate predecessors seems to be Hercules, in its mix of lighthearted conflict and real menace. It also recalls that films message about predetermined expectations, as the film begins with a phenomenally animated prologue explaining how the young Moana, the future chief of a Polynesian island, was summoned by the sea as an infant to return the Heart of Te Fiti (Mother Earth, essentially) to its rightful place, after it was stolen years earlier by Maui, a storied demigod.
Non-viable ways
PrincessMoana
Moana eventually grows into the kind of Disney heroine who cant accept the life thats been decided upon for her. While shes good at the kind of protective work shell have to do as a chief, she cant help but be called back to the ocean, despite the fears of her father, the gruff Chief Tui. Her Gramma Tala, however, encourages Moana to mind her father, but also listen to that other voice inside, the one that accepts change when her village so easily chooses to remain set in its increasingly non-viable ways.
Moana eventually decides to set sail on her own, against her fathers wishes, when the fish begin to disappear from the waters near their beloved Motunui and a legendary, sootlike darkness begins to claim more and more of the islands lands. After all, if she can find Maui and force him to return the Heart of Te Fiti, the world will go back to normal, right Well, not if Maui (Dwayne Johnson) has anything to say on the matter. Moana finds the demigod on a secluded island, lacking both his all-powerful, god-given fish hook and any motivation to help Moana fix the islands woes.
Familiar story
From there, you can guess much of the rest: Moana and Maui meet gruff, go on adventures, encounter singing villains, and learn about the virtues of leadership and forgiveness. Yet whats most exciting about Moana isnt that familiar story, although it tells it effectively and with an engaging charm. Its the films remarkable visuals that situate it a cut above many of its peers. Though a substantial amount of the film is spent at sea, on or around its heroes modest sailboat, Moana manages a number of memorable setpieces. One thrilling action sequence sees the duo facing off against a battalion of small but vicious pirates clad in coconut armor, racing around their mothership alongside Moana. In another, an attempt to reclaim Mauis hook pits them against the giant crab Tamatoa (Jermaine Clement, whose villain ballad Shiny is a highlight), and Tamatoa attempts to turn the tables by bathing himself in hideous fluorescent light; the resulting battle is unsettling by Disneys standards.
Recent years
Moanas world is vividly realized; though its not the first Disney outing in recent years to push the difficult art of water animation forward, its nevertheless breathtaking to see how far its already come. (Credit is owed here to the films many helmers, with billed directors Ron Clements and John Musker and co-directors Don Hall and Chris Williams all helping to realize whats at once a narratively simple and visually complex feature.) In all of its general familiarity, Moana manages to dazzle with one setpiece after the next even in a marketplace now saturated with visually impressive, fast-paced family movies.
It also makes modest attempts to shake up the unlikely hero triumphs over evil trappings of its story, although Jared Bushs screenplay (with seven other writers credited for the story as well) does occasionally rely on gags that seem a little beneath Disneys standards. (Pee jokes and a barrage of sass are incongruous as Dreamworks touches in an otherwise charming movie.) In Moana, the film finds a heroine who only begins to realize her true power when she starts ignoring everybodys plans for her, and in Maui, a hero who has to be dragged kicking and screaming into heroism.
Its hardly subversive, but Moana is nevertheless the sort of rebellious heroine that feels more honest for a lesson-minded family movie in the modern age.
Its an effective riff on the princess formula that manages to preserve that traditions more beloved aspects.

Rowling (in her screenwriting debut), and based on Rowlings book of the same name. It is screened in Majestic and Empire Cineplex, starring Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, Colin Farrell, Carmen Ejogo, Samantha Morton, Ezra Miller, Ron Perlman, and Jon Voight.
It is a must for all movie-goers as the film will be the first instalment of a series of five movies; showcasing different genres and depicting fascinating cultures, time periods, political conflicts and wars in various wizarding societies around the globe.

The film took a total of 15.3m. It is the third highest opening weekend from the JK Rowling series, behind the two final Harry Potter films. Warner Bros executive Josh Berger said: We are thrilled with the huge response from British and Irish audiences.
The film also worked its magic at North American cinemas, taking an estimated $75m (61m) over the weekend - more than the rest of the US box office top 10 combined. -BBC News.
Bustling 1920s New York is gorgeously realized by a judicious teaming of regular Potter designer Stuart Craig and urban dystopia specialist James Hambridge (Hellboy, The Dark Knight), while four-time Potter director David Yates transitions effortlessly from Hogwarts to the wider world, thanks in part to a deft screenplay by JK Rowling.  The Guardian
The new movie Fantastic Beastsand Whereto Find Them is the first full-length Harry Potter franchise story that leaves behind childhood adventure and teen angst, and expressly deals with adult characters living in an adult world.  The Verge
This time the wizarding world isnt about a boy on the verge of manhood, but a man idling in boyhood.  The New York Times
Comments on Rotten Tomatoes website: Yates has fresh tricks up his sleeve as he preps for four more planned films. Five years after the last Potter movie, his 20-something fans can age alongside wizards and witches again. Its Purely Magical.

Deepika is marriage material!
During the rapidfire round on Koffee With Karan, Ranveer Singh was given a choice between Anushka Sharma, Katrina Kaif and Deepika Padukone in the kill-marry-hook up section. While Ranveer said he would marry Deepika as he thinks shes marriage material, he chose to kill Anushka as shes very mean to him for no reason.
Lastly, he said he would hook up with Katrina, softly saying sorry to his fellow couch member and Kats ex, Ranbir Kapoor!
Incidentally, Ranbir and Ranveer also spoke about wanting to star in a film together.
Temporarily called Project X, the film would be directed by the Kapoor scion. The actor duo offered host Karan Johar a chance to produce the film.
Ranveer said, This is a great opportunity for Karan as leading actors rarely agree to do two-hero films these days! Wonder, if Karan will take up the offer.

How Natalie Portman became Jackie O
Its not easy being Jackie.
Until her deat h in 1994, former first lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis was one of the most famous, photographed women in the world. Every outfit was obsessed over; every facial expression - indeed, each word she said - analyzed. This was never more true than during the time period following her husband John F. Kennedys assassination in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, when she impressed the world with her graceful stoicism. The new biopic Jackie, by Chilean filmmaker Pablo Larrain, stars Natalie Portman in the lead role.
The film focuses on the week after the assassination, alternating between the day itself, the state funeral, occasional flashbacks and the interview Kennedy gave to Life magazine in Hyannis Port, Mass., one week after the assassination.Dont let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot, she said in that interview, consciously planting the seeds for a presidential myth.
There will be great presidents again. But there will never be another Camelot.
So how to become Jackie, a role that has been played over the decades by dozens of actresses, from Katie Holmes to Jaclyn Smith, Ginnifer Goodwin to Roma Downey
For one, theres the voice: Kennedy had a distinctly patrician, unusual accent. She has that breathy, almost girlish sound, but with an affected air of calm, said dialect coach Tanya Blumstein, who worked with Portman.
A lot of the girls went to Miss Porters [the Connecticut boarding school Jackie attended], and they were forcibly lady-fied. Jackies accent is mid-Atlantic but peppered with L ong Island.

Delbonis seals Argentinas maiden Davis Cup title
ZAGREB, sunday: Federico Delbonis swept aside Croatias Ivo Karlovic 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 in Sundays deciding rubber as Argentina clinched a first Davis Cup title with a stunning fightback in Zagreb.
Juan Martin del Potro, cheered on by Argentine football legend Diego Maradona, staged an incredible comeback from two sets down to beat Marin Cilic in the opening reverse singles to level the tie at 2-2.
Left-hander Delbonis then tamed the big-serving Karlovic as Argentina, runners-up on four previous occasions, became just the 15th country to lift the trophy in 116 years.
Argentinas Juan Martin del Potro celebrates after winning the Davis Cup World Group final singles match between Croatia and Argentina on November 27, 2016 at the Arena hall in Zagreb. AFP
This is one of those dreams that has come true, said Delbonis.
I tried to keep focused to do what I had to do, thats all I could think because if I thought about anything else it would be a disaster.
Argentina coach Daniel Orsanic added: The guys were amazing today. Juan Martin won an incredible match and Federico played the match of his life. Delbonis was beaten by Cilic in five sets in Fridays first singles match but blew away the 37-year-old Karlovic, an opponent ranked 21 places above him, in just over two hours.
The world number 41 broke Karlovic -- the oldest player to feature in a Davis Cup singles match since 43-year-old Australian Norman Brookes in 1920 -- four times to help Argentina banish the memories of losing finals appearances in 1981, 2006, 2008 and 2011. But much of the credit will go to Del Potro after the Olympic silver medallist, who missed the majority of 2014 and 2015 through injury, outlasted Cilic in an epic five-hour battle of former US Open champions. I was positive all the time and did not let my head drop after going two sets down, said Del Potro. This was an emotionally exhausting match and one of the biggest wins of my career.
Unprecedented recovery
Del Potro had defeated Cilic in eight of 10 previous meetings, but Sundays clash was the first since 2013 and the Croat was invigorated by an animated Zagreb Arena crowd.
Sixth-ranked Cilic dominated a first set tie-break, winning the first five points to seize control, and then broke Del Potros serve twice in succession in the second set to move Croatia within sight of a second title.
But Del Potro, who rallied from behind to overcome Andy Murray in a five-set epic in the semi-final, displayed more remarkable resilience and produced an outrageous tweener to begin the third set.
Cilic fought off two early break points but then succumbed to nerves as the finish line approached, falling 0-40 behind on serve at 5-6, and Del Potro pounced at the third opportunity to reignite his countrys hopes.
Del Potros blistering forehand piled the pressure on Cilic, and the Argentine sent the match to a fifth set by converting his third set point after his opponent again faltered on serve at 5-4.
Del Potro committed a costly double fault to gift Cilic the advantage at the start of the deciding set, but the world number 38 hit straight back in the following game to level.
The Argentine then conjured up a pair of break points at 4-3 with a miscued forehand from Cilic paving the way for Del Potro to complete a stunning fightback -- his first ever from two sets down -- in four hours and 53 minutes.
Its a very hard defeat to take, said Cilic.
I am very disappointed but I have no regrets because I gave all I had and it was just one of those days when it didnt come off. AFP

Ton-up Taylor keeps focus to set Pakistan big target
HAMILTON Sunday: Ross Taylor shrugged off his eye problems to score a superb unbeaten century as New Zealand set Pakistan a formidable 369-run target to win the second Test on Monday Taylor finished 102 not out despite only being cleared to play two days before the Test after scarring on his left eye grew bigger and threatened his vision. He is due to have surgery on Wednesday.
New Zealand declared late on the fourth day in Hamilton at 313 for 5 and Pakistan were one without loss after facing three overs before stumps. The tourists will have to better the record fourth-innings succesful run chase at Seddon Park of 212 for 4 by Australia in 2000 to win on Tuesdays final day and save the two-Test series.
The highest fourth-innings total on the ground is 344 for 6 by Sri Lanka in a drawn Test nearly 26 years ago.
New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson called the innings to a close after a trademark cut to the boundary from Taylor took him to his century. Earlier Tom Latham laid the foundations for the declaration with a battling 80 in a welcome return to form and Williamson made 42.
Pakistan made an early breakthrough when they dismissed Jeet Raval for two with the New Zealand score on 11, but they struggled to assert themselves despite the wicket continuing to show life.
Williamson and Latham fell in the middle session, and Henry Nicholls (26) and Colin de Grandhomme (32) went after the tea interval as the target for Pakistan continued to grow. New Zealand, having won the first Test, need only a draw to beat Pakistan for the first time in 13 Test series dating back to 1985.
Latham on the edge
Taylor and Latham had both struggled for runs through the recent South Africa and India tours as well as the first Test against Pakistan.
Taylor showed no sign of his vision problems when he opened his account with a four off Imran Khan, setting the tone for an innings that contained 16 boundaries. He survived an lbw appeal on 16 in what was otherwise a chanceless knock, placing the ball with precision, particularly with his cut stroke.
Latham lived on the edge. He survived a runout appeal and had a moment of apprehension when the big screen mistakenly put up the word out.
On 41 he was dropped by Sami Aslam and he made his way through lbw shouts.
But his luck deserted him when he tried to fend off a Wahab Riaz bouncer and the ball looped off his glovers to Sarfraz Ahmed behind the stumps.
Wicketkeeper Ahmed was also in the action to remove Williamson who feathered a good-length Imran delivery in the third over after lunch to break a 96-run stand with Latham. De Grandhomme contributed a whirlwind 32 off 21 balls to a 35-run partnership with Taylor while BJ Watling was not out 15 at the close. For Pakistan, Imran was the most effective bowler with three for 76 while Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz took a wicket each. AFP

Sarath Silva the elegant left-hander
Visiting his Borella residence I found Sarath Silva, one of the most talented batsmen produced by Nalanda College. As a young kid he used to play softball cricket at Campbell Place. He did not have any high ambitions of playing serious cricket at that time. Sarath also states that he played cricket just for fun. Mr Kandaswamy who was the Prefect of Games was a tower of strength at Nalanda. He spotted this slip of a lad, whose talent he recognized. Mr Kandaswamy immediately invited him to attend first eleven practices.
Sarath states that he did not even have a pair of longs at the time. Anyway he fitted into the setup smoothly at the tender age of 14 years and 3 months. Sarath reiterates that he was selected to bat at no 3, and in the Big Match he carried his bat to score 66. His innings was filled with strokes of sheer elegance.
As far as he can recollect he played for 4 years in the Ist eleven team and has scored hundreds in each of those years. Sarath adds that in his last year he scored four hundreds, they were against Dharmapala, Royal, St Anthonys and St Benedicts. Also in that years Big Match he got twin fifties.
Sarath recollects, immediately after leaving College he joined SSC and in his first season he got 96 not out. In the next season scored over 500 runs and the late F.C. de Saram paid the highest accolade to Sarath saying that he was the most talented left-hander he has seen.
However Sarath adds that F.C. de Saram also mentioned to him, that he was not showing much interest in the game. Briefly he was a wayward genius.
Sarath Silva, the lanky left-hander was billed to open for a Sri Lankan representive eleven in 1961. The tall West Indian pace man Wesley Hall was at his peak, in that team which toured Sri Lanka. He relates that Wesley Hall had such a long run up, nearly reaching the ropes. When he took stance, to face Hall running up to bowl, he lost his concentration and in the fifth ball he was completely bamboozled and was yorked, lock stock and barrel and clean bowled for a duck. When Richie Benauds team toured Sri Lanka, Sarath states he was billed to play and at the last moment for some unknown reason, he was not included, which remains a mystery to this day.
When asked about the best batsman, he has ever played against. Sarath was quick to point out that it was none other than C.I. Gunasekera, who according to Sarath was better than Sanath Jayasuriya. His pick as the best bowler he faced was Sonny Yatawara, he was explosive off the wicket, states Sarath.
He picks F.C. de Saram as the best captain, whom he says never lost control of the game he was handling. Sarath is of the opinion that the elite who managed the game then, were pure poppycock because they had never played the game.
These were Saraths own words. He recalls that Gerry Gooneratne picked his talent well and Chandrasiri Weerasinghe who never hooked the ball in the air was the best bat he saw concludes Sarath.

Coutinho blow a test for Liverpool - Origi
LONDON, Sunday: Liverpools Divock Origi says his team-mates must step up in the absence of Philippe Coutinho as they prepare to face Leeds United in the League Cup quarter-finals on Tuesday.
The influential Coutinho sustained suspected ankle ligament damage during Liverpools 2-0 win over Sunderland on Saturday and could now be out until next year.
After replacing Coutinho, Origi scored Liverpools opener and the Belgium striker believes there is sufficient quality in the squad to compensate for the unavailability of their Brazilian talisman.
Its unfortunate with Philippe because everyone knows how good a person he is and I think he was in top form, so I hope its not too bad, Origi told the Liverpool website.
But Im sure he will come back stronger and I always said that we have a strong group. Everybody has to help each other.
Im always ready. I believe I can help the team a lot this year and I believe I have the qualities to start in this team.
With Adam Lallana and Daniel Sturridge doubtful and Roberto Firmino unlikely to be risked after taking a kick to his calf against Sunderland, Origi seems certain to start against Leeds.
Sturridge scored twice as Liverpool, who lost to Manchester City in last seasons final, overcame Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 in the fourth round.
Leeds, fifth in the second-tier Championship, overcame Norwich City on penalties and are the lowest-ranked team left in the competition.
There could be an upset on the cards in Tuesdays other fixture, where Premier League strugglers Hull City entertain Rafael Benitezs Newcastle United, who are flying high at the Championship summit.
Newcastle saw an eight-game winning streak ended by a 1-0 loss at home to Blackburn Rovers after Benitez made a raft of changes and he called on his team to raise their game for the trip to the KCOM Stadium.
I think we have to take the positives. We were so good for so many games and that has to be the way to go forward, said the Spaniard.
We have to analyse quickly what we did wrong and be ready for the next game in three days. That is a positive thing.
Manchester United will hope to shake themselves out of their domestic torpor on Wednesday when West Ham United return to Old Trafford just three days after the sides 1-1 Premier League draw there.
United have drawn their last four home league games and have scored just four goals in their last five domestic fixtures on their own patch.
Speaking after the draw with West Ham, in which United manager Jose Mourinho was again sent to the stands, midfielder Ander Herrera expressed disbelief at the teams current woes.
Were playing the right way and doing things the right way, said the newly capped Spain international, whose side beat holders City 1-0 in round four, in a Sky Sports interview.
I think West Ham are a good side and they didnt get the ball for more than one minute (at a time), so its unbelievable that we arent winning these games.
Its the first time in my career that Ive felt something like this.
United will be without midfielders Paul Pogba and Marouane Fellaini through suspension.
Having started on the bench against West Ham on Sunday, Wayne Rooney will hope to return to the starting XI as he chases a record-equalling 249th United goal.

Draw a miracle from worst Barca display - Luis Enrique
MADRID, Sunday: Barcelona boss Luis Enrique lamented what he described as the worst display of his time in charge as the Catalan giants escaped with a 1-1 draw at Real Sociedad on Sunday.
Barca have now failed to win in their last eight visits to San Sebastian, but for once the slip-up felt like a victory as Sociedad dominated from start to finish. The draw is positive because we take a point from a match in which it was practically impossible to take a point, Enrique told BeIN Sports Spain
Real Sociedad were infinitely better than us with and without the ball. They won all the battles. It is almost a miracle that we took a point.
Barca avoided defeat at Anoeta for the first time in five seasons, but fall six points adrift of La Liga leaders Real Madrid ahead of their meeting in El Clasico next weekend.
As almost always happens here Real got the better of us and if someone was watching the game without seeing the colour of the shirts they would think the other team was Barca, added Enrique. AFP

Ashwins triple strike leaves England reeling
Mohali: Ravichandran Ashwin rattled Englands top order with three wickets to leave them reeling on 78 for four at stumps on day three of the third Test on Monday, still trailing India by 56.
The visitors had earlier conceded a 134-run first-innings lead after Indias lower-order batsmen gave the hosts control of the game in Mohali.
At close of play Joe Root (36) and nightwatchman Gareth Batty (0) were at the crease. Ashwin drew first blood, getting England skipper Alastair Cook bowled for 12. The England skipper had been living dangerously, with two lbw calls against him going for reviews, first by India and then by the batsman himself. But he survived only to see his stumps shattered later on.
England were already hurt by the absence of teenage opener Haseeb Hameed, who is in danger of missing the series with a hand injury and has yet to bat in this innings.
Ashwin kept up the pressure from his end as he bamboozled Moeen Ali (5) with a flighted delivery, causing the batsman to give away a catch to mid-on.
Root, who opened in place of Hameed, tried to steady the innings with Jonny Bairstow, but the wicketkeeper-batsmans resistance did not last long.
Off-spinner Jayant Yadav got Bairstow, who top-scored with a dogged 89 in Englands first innings of 283 but this time was caught behind for 15. An unrelenting Ashwin, the worlds top-ranked Test bowler, soon trapped Ben Stokes lbw for five as the visitors slipped further.
Earlier the Indian innings saw five half-centuries before the hosts, who resumed the day on 271-6, were bowled out for 417 in the afternoon session.
Ravindra Jadeja top-scored with a dominant 90 while Jayant Yadavs 55 -- his maiden fifty in only his second game -- gave the England bowlers a frustrating two sessions of play.
Seam bowler Stokes claimed his third Test five-wicket haul while leg-spinner Adil Rashid took four wickets. Jadeja, who registered his career-best Test score surpassing his 68 at Lords in 2014, fell 10 runs short of his maiden Test ton. But his 80-run stand with Jayant Yadav underpinned Indias impressive lower-order performance.
The left-handed Jadeja, who started the day on 31, took over responsibility for piloting the innings after the fall of his overnight partner Ashwin for 72.
Ashwins wicket ended a 97-run seventh-wicket stand between him and Jadeja. The pair had lifted India after the loss of four wickets in the final session on Sunday. AFP
