Big Maple Leaf gold coin stolen from Berlins Bode Museum
The 1.18-inch thick coin, with a diameter of 20.9 inches, has a face value of 1 million Canadian dollars ($750,000).
By weight alone, however, it would be worth almost $4.5 million at market prices.
Its gone, museum spokesman Markus Farr said Monday.
The museum says the coin is in the Guinness Book of Records for its unmatched purity of 999.99/1000 gold. It has a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II on one side and maple leaves on the other.
The coin was issued by the Royal Canadian Mint in 2007.
It was loaned to the Bode Museum from a private collection in December, 2010. Police said it was probably stolen by a group of thieves who entered the museum undetected through a window, possibly with the help of a ladder.
Based on the information we have so far, we believe that the thief, maybe thieves, broke open a window in the back of the museum next to the railway tracks, police spokesman Winfrid Wenzel said. The coin was secured with bullet-proof glass inside the building. That much I can say.
The Bode Museum has one of the worlds largest coin collections with more than 540,000 items. -NBC News

PickMe, Good Place to Start
PickMe; Sri Lankas home grown technology based taxi hailing service is well into its second successful year of operations. Whilst they have expanded their network and introduced more user friendly features to their app, their success story lies not just in their daily increasing fleet but their young and dynamic staff. PickMe is the ideal place for techno geeks i.e. app developers to let loose their skills.
The Company is constantly on the lookout for talented young people who can find ways to make their App even smarter. As a tech based operation PickMe, gives priority to young people who are skilled in developing software.
When the Company first launched the hailing service with their app, there had been only 15 people on their staff and they achieved the goal of becoming a credible, established service in a very short time.
Another significant aspect about PickMe is that they are not looking for highly qualified app developers when they are looking to recruit. According to CEO, Zulfer Jiffrey all comers are welcome provided they make the cut.
Some of the PickMe staffers were eager to speak about the opportunities they had to advance themselves within the Company. Rishoban Jeevamohan, who started out as a beta passenger, joined PickMe as a Customer Communications Executive.
According to Keshan Fernando who is a software engineer, PickMe for a one year old start-up has grown rapidly. We keep working towards taking the Company to the next level. We are given many opportunities to grow with the company. Regular appraisals and the training we get help us to succeed in our career. Zulfer says that there is a common misconception that PickMe is a place for tech-wizs and IT professionals. That is far from the truth, technology plays only a 50% role in the business. Operational activities are of equal importance.
This is further confirmed by staff members who say that company operations are a nice mix. They believe that the success of their app is due to giving the operations side of the business equal importance, as the satisfaction of their passengers and drivers has helped the PickMes rapid growth.
Given the relaxed yet lively office atmosphere, all of PickMes employees seem to love their jobs. I want to work here for as long as I can, says Neerja Vimaleswaran, a Software Quality Assurance Engineer. She says as a woman in what is considered a male dominated industry; she does not feel unequal to her male co-workers. I dont feel any gender inequality here; everyone is just equal.

Request for Hybrid Court due to lack of trust in judicial system under former govt.
Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samararaweera said the only reason for many people to request for a Hybrid Court was that they had lost the trust in the judicial system under the former government.
Minister Samaraweera was speaking in response to a question raised by a journalist that the majority of the people in North and East want Hybrid courts to be established.
However, under the present government we have an independent and accountable judiciary in Sri Lanka. We will do justice to all the Tamils who supported us,he said.
He further said that not all Tamils want Hybrid courts to be established. It is only the request of a few extremists.
When asked about the future plans of the government with regard to the two year extension by the UN, the Minister said at present, the government is working to implement the truth seeking mechanism.
"Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has been consulting different experts. One of our priorities will be to get Cabinet approval for Truth seeking commission.We need to talk to all the leaders and work out a road map,"he said.
When was asked whether he emphasised on a referendum for a new Constitution in Geneva and whether the President and Prime Minister are of the same opinion, Minister Samaraweera said the mandate given to us by the people of this country on January 8, 2015 was to bring a new Constitution which will celebrate the diversity of our country.
I personally believe that a referendum is a risk that we have to take,he said.
He further said that it is not a risk as many people say and the President and the Prime Minister will want to keep to the promise given by the government to the people.

Unable to protect those found guilty of killing media persons or sportsmen: President

President Maithripala Sirisena said today he was not prepared to make any war hero a suspect in the charges leveled against the armed forces and the government on the alleged violations of human rights during the war against terrorism.
However, he said he was unable to protect those found guilty of acts not connected to national security and those guilty of killing media persons or sportsmen. 
He made this statement at the opening of the newly constructed three-storeyed building at the Defence Services School in Kurunegala today.
The President pointed out that it is the duty and responsibility of the government to protect war heroes who fought for the motherland.
He assured the audience that he would always fulfill his responsibility to the country as the President and Defence Minister and would always take the fullest responsibility on behalf of any problem face by the officers, staff members and war heroes who fought against the LTTE.

Unbelievable India thrash Australia to maintain Test run
Dharamsala: India thrashed Australia by eight wickets on Tuesday to seal a Test series marked by outbursts and controversies 2-1 and underline their status as the world's number one side.
Chasing 106 on the penultimate day of the fourth Test, opener Lokesh Rahul hit 51 not out in Dharamsala as India seized back the Border-Gavaskar trophy from Australia.
India's stand-in skipper Ajinkya Rahane (38 not out) hit two sixes in a row off Pat Cummins en route to the comprehensive win, as fans waved giant India flags and danced in the stands.
India have now won seven Test series win in a row, a run that kicked off with their triumph in Sri Lanka in 2015, and includes victories over New Zealand, England and Bangladesh in an extended home season.
Skipper Virat Kohli, who was forced to sit out the final Test with a shoulder injury, said the hard-fought win over Australia was the most satisfying of the recent run.
"Unbelievable. This is the best series win so far," said Kohli, who received the Test mace on behalf of India for ending the season as the world's top side.
"The way the Australian team gave us a fight was really amazing, but the way the guys kept bouncing back showed the true character of the side."
Australia captain Steve Smith apologised for letting emotion get the better of him. On Monday, footage indicated he called Murali Vijay a "cheat" for wrongly claiming a catch on Monday.
"I have been pretty intense throughout this series. I really wanted to do well for the team. At times I have been in my own bubble and have let my emotions slip. I apologise for that," said Smith.
It was one of several incidents during the bad-tempered series, including Kohli accusing Smith of systematically abusing the decision review system during the second Bangalore Test.
In the maiden Test played in Dharamsala, India scored 332 in their first innings in reply to Australia's 300, before the tourists collapsed for just 137 on the third day.
On day four, India lost Vijay to fast bowler Cummins and Cheteshwar Pujara to a run out, but they were the only scares for the hosts who reached their target in less than 24 overs.
India owed their win to all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, who top-scored with 63 runs in the first innings before taking three wickets with his left-arm spin during Australia's second knock -- and was duly named man of the match and man of the series.
"The way the guys handled situations and the way Ajinkya led was outstanding. But the maturity and the responsibility shown by all the guys in the team was pleasing to see, especially from the outside," said Kohli.
The contest will also be remembered for the form of Aussie skipper Smith, who amassed 499 runs with three centuries, becoming only the sixth visiting batsman to hit as many tons.
Kohli, who was disparagingly compared to US President Donald Trump as he came under fire from Australian media, had a series to forget, scoring only 46 in the first three Tests. - AFP

Abject state of SPC councillors hostel, disgrace to members dignity
Southern Provincial Councillors who occupy the councils hostel complex at Labuduwa, Galle have to undergo immense hardships due to numerous shortcomings. Especially sanitary facilities and water supply to toilets are substandard and unsatisfactory. Due to the inferior and unhygienic situation of the hostel premises, the councillors go through innumerable inconveniences and the pitiful situation of hostels is a humiliation to the dignity of the councillors, chief whip of the ruling coalition Councillor Ajith Rajapaksa alleged.
He made the allegation at the council meeting held yesterday at the Council secretariat at Kalegama, Galle. Chairman Somawansa Kodagoda presided over the meeting.
The councillors from Matara and Hambantota districts come to Galle one day prior to council meetings and stay at the hostels to attend the meetings. The councillors who stay there suffer greatly owing to the various deficiencies prevailing at council hostels, the councillor further said.
Rajapaksa urged urgent attention of the authorities and swift action taken to rectify the complications of the hostel complex. Opposition Leader Tennakoon Nilame also supported the allegations levelled by councillor Rajapaksa.
In response to the councillors charges Chairman Somawanasa Kodagoda said a suitable land for the construction of a new hostel complex for the councillors had been acquired and necessary building plans had been prepared and duly sanctioned by the Southern Province Engineering Services Department. Now all measures have been taken for the construction of a new hostel complex for councillors. At present we are waiting to receive the necessary funds. As soon as we get the funds, the work on the proposed project would commence, the Chairman assured.

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said that moves were taken to issue the G.C.E Ordinary Level examination 2016 results within a short period compared to the previous years. He said that he is happy about it as it saves the valuable time of students. Owing to the delay of issuing results, it has been noticed, that students had to wait for a long period to receive the results.
The valuable time of students can be utilised to further their education when results are issued without delay. Having taken this situation into consideration, the Education Ministry took a policy decision to issue Ordinary Level examination results on March 28 from this year. The Minister said that he was informed by the Examinations Commissioner General that the pass rate of the Ordinary Level examination 2016 is higher when compared to previous years. It has been observed that the pass-rate in Mathematics is also high. This can be considered as a fruitful indication of the quality improvement of the countrys education sector, he said.

All set for a galloping April
Track conditions are going to be firm and if there are heavy showers the track would be good going. The track conditions will suit 99 percent of horses which are based in Nuwara Eliya as per their breeding and their past record in Indian racing.
This good news comes from veteran horseman, Acting CEO, Clerk of the Course, Stipendiary Steward and Jockey Trainer of the RTC, Sinclair Marshal. He further stated that the days leading up to April 2 race date would see some light showers, creating the expected conditions. The meteorological department forecasts slightly cloudy but bright weather on April 2, April 16, and April 29 race dates ensuring excellent racing conditions throughout the season.
Event Coordinator and Stipendiary Steward RTC, Nikhil Punna, stated that the competition this season is expected to be fiercer than the seasons gone by, due to the Selvaratnam Challenge Trophy Class 1 race to be held on April 2, in addition to the usual Royal Turf Club, signature race RTC Magic Million that is to be held on April 16, both which offer a Rs 1 Million stake to the winner. An International Jockey Competition which is currently in the organizational stage, is targeted for April 29. Punna stated that the demand for tickets for all three events, have been huge, but a certain number of tickets have been reserved for those who wish to purchase tickets at the gates on race days to ensure no one is disappointed.
The Selvaratnam Trophy is supported by a family of exemplary Horsemen, Hailing from Nuwara Eliya, Renga Selvaratnam and sons Gopi, Karthik and Druba Selvaratnam. Trained under the tutelage of legendary Sri Lanka Trainer Renga Selvaratnam, Druba has trained Sheikh Ahmed bin Rashid al Maktoums horses for the past 27 years and was the Prime Mover behind the creation of the Dubai Race course. He easily sailed past his 1,000-win Mark in 2006 and has never looked back since. The RTC is looking forward to his advice and support in the coming years.
Speaking to Punna, Senior Trainer Jayantha stated that he has a few good runners this season, including Champion Honorius who shook the race course by winning his first ever race in Sri Lanka. Owned by Fearless Stables belonging to Eresha Weerasinghe, Honorius is targeted to win the Class 5 races with Crimson Quest owned by Gamini Jayaratne and his wife and trained by veteran trainer Madialagan being the main Challenger.
Champion Trainer Raju stated that he has a good string of horses especially for the Class 1 Races and stated that Alcazaba and the RTC Governors Cup 2016 winner Roswell owned by Deepthika Jayakody are in peak condition, whereas others are moderate in performance.
He stated that their main challenger is Meheran owned by Gamini Jayaratne who has been in top form recently. Trainer for the Jayaratne Stables, Indian Trainer, Manish Raj Sethi stated that he had not had much opportunity to train Meheran for the Class 1 Race to his satisfaction, but nevertheless he hoped to challenge both Alcazaba and Roswell for the Million races. He is also confident he will pick up some smaller races for his stable. Trainer Madialagan was not available for comment at the time of going to press.
Event coordinator Punna was also excited about the other treats organized for this season which include performances from a number of celebrity singers to the accompaniment of well known bands such Flame and Misty, plus fashion shows that are expected to rock the race course.
As always animal welfare is uppermost with the RTC, who have started a Pony Welfare Fund for around 115 Ponies registered with RTC. Dr Balaji Consultant Medical Officer for RTC stated that, RTC has set up a free medical scheme for these ponies owned by low income groups and the unemployed Youth of Nuwara Eliya. The scheme would ensure that the Ponies would be vaccinated periodically and their general health condition monitored from time to time.
RTC has introduced a Raffle for this season to finance the scheme where on course spectators would be able to purchase Raffles Tickets for their favorite horses and a draw will be held among the tickets sold for each winning horse plus the horses that are placed second and third. Prizes are Rs 10,000 for the winning horse, Rs 5,000 for the second horse and Rs 2,500 for the third horse.
President RTC Panduka Keerthinanda stated that the RTC has further enforced its commitment to animal welfare by importing a state of the art Equine Ambulance from the United Kingdom at considerable cost.
Dr Balaji stated that this is not only the only Equine Ambulance in Sri Lanka but that it has the most modern, up to date features such as two adjustable partitions with breast and breeching bars, front and side ramps for the horses to enter and exit comfortably, two privacy screens complete with vinyl bags for mounting externally, as well as an electric winch mounted internally with winching attachments.

BASL to take up Kannans appointment at next General Meeting
The controversy surrounding the appointment of R.Kannan to the High Court is to be taken up at the next General Meeting of the of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) on April 1,BASL President U.R.De Silva.
This would be the first General meeting the new BASL President would chair since taking over office earlier this month. De Silva has also asked for an appointment with the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) to discuss any grievances they might have, I am expecting a reply from the JSC and thereafter I will go with executive committee to meet them. Then we have to put forward our suggestions,he said.
The BASL President added that the BASL would take a stance on Kannan after the General Meeting and having been made aware of the concerns of the JSC.
The appointment of Kannan to the High Court caused a stir within judicial circles when the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) opposed the appointment by President Maithripala Sirisena. The President in turn stated that the appointment was based on the recommendation made by the BASL. Since then however, the BASL has denied making such a recommendation,
We have categorically denied that we have made any recommendations with regard to R.Kannan. There has been a misunderstanding as it was only the President of the Association (Geoffrey Alagaratnam) on his own and not by the decision of the Executive Committee or Bar Council,sent some letters to the President. When it was brought to the notice of the Bar Council, he admitted that he never got permission from the Bar Council to send such a letter using the Councils letter head,explained De Silva.
We informed the Judges Association that we never made any recommendations to the President with regard to Kannans matter.The Judicial Services Association having considered our letter have informed the JSC that this what the BASL said and that there was no recommendation made by the BASL. The JSC in turn informed the President that the BASL has nothing to do with appointment,he added.
The new BASL President also stated that he would inform the JSC of their stance once a decision has been made on the appointment at the upcoming General Meeting.

Bikkhus on the war path
A group of Bikkhus, known for their rabid pro-Rajapaksa affiliations, and, since the day the new government was elected to office, were going all out in conducting virulent anti-regime campaigns, on Monday, vowed to step up their agitation, to force the government out of office, even if it means shedding blood in the process. Forming themselves into a collective of nationalist and Bikkhu organisations, who have banded themselves against the government, the pack, led by the Ven Muruttettuwe Ananda thera, of Abayaramaya fame, claimed at a media briefing that, this time around, they are set for a do or die battle until they see the last of the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe regime and has even called on the Mahanayakes to join in their project. The agitation, the monk said, will be centred on the governments sale of national assets, the incarceration of the countrys war heroes and the new constitution that is aimed at dividing the country rata bedana viyavasthawa.
Ven Muruttettuwe may still be smarting by the failed nurses strike he spearheaded the other day against the SAITM and may be planning to hit back this time around bringing with him all Bikkhu organisations and so called nationalists who have been spewing racist venom all along to incite the majority populace since the ouster of Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The mother of all agitations, to be launched by these chauvinist elements, is slated for August. The reason, as proclaimed by the Ven Muruttettuwe; they dont want to drag the people out onto the roads during the intervening Avurudu and Vesak. Perhaps the Ven Thera may have made allowance for Poson, which falls in June, and set apart July for the grand rehearsals for the agitation to end all other agitations.
But what is not mentioned by the Ven Muruttettuwe is the Provincial Council elections, to three provinces, is due in September. What better time to stage a massive anti-government protest than by targeting the Political Council elections Not to be outdone, the GMOA too has given a weeks ultimatum to the government to disband the SAITM or else. .No doubt the doctors strike and the anti-SAITM agitations staged by the medical students will be timed to dovetail into the massive protest of the pro-Rajapaksa Bikkhu front, with the sole purpose of creating an anarchic situation in the country to make the government unpopular and thus advance the agenda of the Rajapaksas.
The Bikkhu organisation, which describes itself patriotic nationalists, formed to save the nation from impending catastrophe, by the sale of national assets, was very much alive and kicking at the time Mahinda Rajapaksa invited the Chinese to virtually takeover the country by handing over the key economic projects to the Asian Dragon and plunging the government to astronomical debt. Large swathes of land from Hambantota were given away to China for the purpose of building the port. Large scale evictions too were carried out to facilitate the venture, where, long time inhabitants of traditional land in Hambantota were whisked away to make way for the Chinese projects. Ven Muruttettuwe and his band of patriotic Bikkhus were nowhere to be spotted. Ditto for the arrest of war heroes which the Bikkhu front has cited as another theme in their agitation.
None of these patriots, or the jathika balavega, took to the streets when the war winning former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka was dragged away and thrown behind bars. Nor were they anywhere to be seen when he was jeered at and humiliated when brought before court for hearings of the numerous cases manufactured against him. Where were these patriots, when Karuna Amman, who was responsible for the massacre of a bus load of novice monks, and the gunning down in cold blood of nearly 600 policemen in the East, when this notorious mass murderer was invested with ministerial office by Mahinda Rajapaksa that required he receives the salutes of the army and police. As for the constitution, nothing has so far been finalised, as attested to by even the Mahanayake of the Malwatte Chapter. Besides, inputs to the proposed new constitution was also made by members of the Joint Opposition who functioned in the various committees, although they later pulled out, but not before all the major tasks had been completed as stated by Minister Lakshman Kiriella. Besides, a good majority of the protesters at the grand agitation will no doubt be those who will not even have an inkling about matters in relation to constitution making but composed of the riff raff that one usually sees on any May Day in highly inebriated states.
The government should do well to see through the project of the combined Bikkhu front, which is clearly aimed at causing anarchy on the streets with the help of likeminded nationalist organisations and student fronts, reminiscent of the ugly days of the second JVP insurrection in the late eighties. It should be prepared to deal with mischief makers who are no more than foot soldiers of Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Bob Dylan finally agrees to accept Nobel Prize for Literature

Bob Dylan will finally accept his Nobel Prize for Literature in Stockholm this weekend, the academy has announced.
The American singer was awarded the prize in October but failed to travel to pick up the award, or deliver the lecture that is required to receive the 8m kroner ($910,000) prize.
The academy said it would meet Dylan in private in the Swedish capital, where he is giving two concerts.
He will not lecture in person but is expected to send a taped version.
If he does not deliver a lecture by June, he would have to forfeit the prize money.
A blog entryfrom Prof Sara Danius, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, said: "The good news is that the Swedish Academy and Bob Dylan have decided to meet this weekend.
"The Academy will then hand over Dylan's Nobel diploma and the Nobel medal, and congratulate him on the Nobel Prize in Literature.
"The setting will be small and intimate, and no media will be present; only Bob Dylan and members of the Academy will attend, all according to Dylan's wishes."
Prof Darius said taped lectures had been sent by other winners in the past, including Alice Munro in 2013.
Earlier this week she had said the academy had had no phone conversations with Dylan and that he had until 10 June to perform the lecture in order to receive the money.
"What he decides to do is his own business," she had said.

Brother complains of foul play
A brother of a woman expatriate worker named Subramaniam Palaniyandi Katpagavalli (41) whose body arrived at the Katunayake Airport from Saudi Arabia on March 25, has lodged a complaint to the Katunayake police saying his sisters death aroused suspicion.
The brother. Paramasivam, requested a fair investigation into her death and if any foul play is revealed, to take legal action against the culprits involved and ensure that compensation and the insurance claim be paid to her next of kin.
Paramasivam said his sister, a mother of three separated from her husband, left the country on October 12, 2015 for employment in Saudi Arabia through an agency. Although they communicated with her for about six months, since then they had lost contact.
On November 1, 2016, they got a WhatsApp message from a Sri Lankan woman in Saudi Arabia saying that his sister died after languishing in the Oleya Baba Detention Camp in Riyadh in a serious conditions.
On November 8, 2016, the Sri Lanka Embassy in Riyad confirmed his sisters death.
They were able to get down her sisters body four months later on March 25 with the intervention of the Foreign Employment Ministry. Paramasivam said his complaint to the Katunayake police holds the number CIB 197/219 - 25-03-2017.

Cancellation of Rajinikanth's SL visit : Protests in Jaffna
Hundreds of people, on Monday, rallied in Sri Lankas Jaffna to protest against Tamil Nadu politicians under whose pressure Rajinikanth cancelled his visit to the country.
He was scheduled to hand over houses to displaced ethnic Tamils.
Protestors belonging to different parties, including the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), gathered near Jaffnas iconic Nallur Kovil, raising slogans against politicians in Tamil Nadu.
The 66-year-old actor was scheduled to hand over houses built by Lyca Groups Gnanam Foundation for displaced Tamils in the decade-old separatist war in northern Jaffna.
He had cancelled the visit following mounting opposition from Tamil Nadu politicians.
Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) and Tamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi (TVK) had urged the actor to not go ahead with his two-day visit.
The actor had said he took the decision after founders of Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) and VCK, Vaiko and Thol Thirumavalavan respectively, and TVK leader T. Velmurugan asked him to consider withdrawing from the event.
However, senior TNA leader Suresh Premachandran said Mr. Rajinikanths visit was a corporate advertising effort to use the Lankan Tamil issue.
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksas son Namal, an opposition legislator, had slammed Tamil Nadu politicians for forcing the actor to cancel his visit.

HAVE DENGUE DAY EVERYDAY
I have been a doctor working in Sri Lanka for more than 53 years. In the old days there were major epidemics of Smallpox, Malaria and Polio. Despite not having all the facilities that the present generation have  like transport, communication and modern technology these illnesses were totally eradicated. Fortunately, vaccines for Smallpox and Polio contributed greatly to eradicate these illnesses.
They did not have Smallpox Week, Malaria Week and Polio Week once in two or three months to eradicate these illnesses. All steps were taken daily in all corners of the country to eradicate these illnesses.
I wish to request the WHO, the UN Organisations, the Sri Lankan Government, the Ministry of Health, the Sri Lanka Medical Association and all the Medical Associations of this country including the GMOA to give the highest priority to find ways and means to eradicate Dengue as soon as possible.
I wish to make the following points:
1) For the prevention of Dengue, instead of having Dengue Week once in two or three months please have Dengue Day Everyday.
2) Early detection of Dengue -
Between 12 and 24 hours of any fever the Dengue Antigen Test must be done. This will give a warning to the doctor, the patient and the family. The Dengue Antigen Test is quite an expensive test ranging between Rs.1,500 to Rs.2,000 in the private sector. The private hospitals and laboratories must reduce this charge considerably to allow patients to get this test done. The Ministry of Health must provide all financial assistance to all government hospitals and laboratories big or small to have facilities to do this test for every patient in this country when requested by the doctor. Most patients do not know about this test and the value of this test. Many patients do not realize until the 3rd or 4th day that they are having Dengue Fever.
3) If the Dengue Antigen Test is positive, a Full Blood Count must be done everyday from the second day for 6 days to give an idea of the seriousness of this illness and to help in the treatment.
4) All doctors in this country, I am sure, know how to treat Dengue Fever if they have the warning that the patient may suffer from all the ill effects of this deadly illness.
5) The eradication of Dengue Fever must be given top priority above everything else in this country.

Construction of incomplete school buildings accelerated
There are a number of uncompleted school buildings in the North Central Province which are yet to be completed. the PC (NCP ) has been allocated around 7,000 million recently for attending to the shortcomings in 814 schools in the province. The half completed building complex of Anuradhapura K.B. Rathnayaka Vidyalaya , within a very close proximity of Anuradhapura city, is an example. The parents question the authorities as to when the long delayed construction of the building would start and endowed to the children. Also the special feature is that the K.B. Rathnayaka Vidyalaya is the only aesthetic school in the North Central Province. When inquired from Anuradhapura Provincial Education Secretary (Mrs.) Anoma Manel about this matter she said that construction of the particular school building began during the 2012 Dayata Kirula programe. She indicated that the Provincial Council has identified about 20 half constructed school buildings in the province and plans are underway to commence the construction work again in 2017. Anoma Manel stated that a sum of Rs. 19 million has been allocated to renovate the K.B. Rathnayaka Vidyalaya including the completion of the said building under this programe.

Contemporary knowledge via creativity
This reviewer is grateful for the arrival of this excellent book meant for teenagers, although adults like me could gain information on such subjects like ecology, peace and value of human qualities. The text is educative but presented in creative form with stories, anecdotes and the like thus evoking the interest of the reader. It is an easy and lucid style that the writer employs to make what he wants stress effectively.
The title of the book, I feel, carefully chosen- Blue indicates studies centering on the Ocean and Green indicates the Greenery in the Land. The importance of cherishing Human Values is the undertone of the writers intention. He succeeds in his effort. There are 12 topics he takes for elucidation. And under each subject thought provoking questions to answer relevant questions that could reinforce a total understanding of the subjects discussed.
These are the 12 topics inEnglish translation:
01. A Good World full of Blue and Green (Does the author also suggests the good governance envisaged by the two political parties at present using their party colours I dont know)
02. Beautiful Sea Coast in Moonlit Dusk
03. The Home Garden of Appan
04. Each drop of water is priceless
05. Making use of the Resources and practicing good Habits
06. Many usages of planting trees and make them grow
07. Living Beings that speak, sing and dance ( In this otherwise good printed book, a typo error has occurred in the word Uyirinangal
08. The beautiful hillcountry that is attractive make your body cold.
09. Resourceful desert jungles
10. Happy Life in a beautiful village
11. The Living Beings that live in jungles, the birds that fly in the sky, those beings that crawl on the land and swim in water are all our friends
12. Peace and Trouble Free World allover
What I like most in this book is how the fundamentals of good living are subtly given as a creative writing.
I must say something about the writer of this book. Hailing from Uduppiddy, an educated village in the north of the country, S.ThillaiNadaRaasa is a versatile man of many parts. I knew him as an actor on the stage and radio- an improvising actor, a creative writer with many books for children, a trilinguist ,a public speaker that adds personal anecdote sand make the audience laugh, a wonderful human being a well - known Public Servant.
It wouldnt be inappropriate if I give his credentials for file of record of a successful public servant among other things:

Counterfeit medicines  patients safety at risk
Counterfeit medicine has become a serious threat to patient safety. Everyday thousands of people die or suffer as a result of using counterfeit medicines. Commensurate rise in pharmaceutical counterfeiting is caused to increase the death rate potentially around the globe. World Health Organisation (WHO) says more than 120,000 people a year die in Africa as a result of fake anti-malarial drugs alone. In Singapore, four people died and seven suffered brain damage after taking counterfeit drugs to treat erectile dysfunction. It is said that 10 percent of worlds drug supply is counterfeit.
Counterfeit medicine is fake medicine that has been deliberately and fraudulently produced and mislabelled with respect to identity and source to make it appear to be genuine products. Any counterfeit pharmaceutical products might contain the right active ingredients which are of bad quality or in the wrong dose - either too high or too low. Some of the ingredients found in the counterfeit medicines included brick dust, paint, floor wax and pesticides. These products are mostly being supplied to the market proportionately to the genuine products with similar labels and logos. World Health Organisation (WHO) prefers to use it as substandard, spurious, falsely-labelled, falsified and counterfeit (SSFFC) medicines. Counterfeit pharmaceutical products are often produced in very poor and unhygienic conditions.
Growth of counterfeit medicines
Counterfeit medical products are manufactured in many different countries and in all regions. A number of factors have contributed to rise in pharmaceutical counterfeiting. Included among them are the growing involvement in the drug supply chain of under regulated wholesalers and re-packagers, the proliferation of internet pharmacies, advancement in technology that make it easier for criminals to make falsified medicines. In a statement in 2011, the World Health Organisation cited, increasing international trade of pharmaceuticals and sales via the internet has further facilitated the entry of counterfeiters. The record shows an enormous growth in manufacturing pharmaceutical products in less developed countries over recent years. China, India and Hong Kong are among the biggest manufacturers in pharmaceutical products with 68%, 28% and 1.5% respectively.
The European Commission Taxation and Customs Union says, these countries being predominantly the greatest exporters to the countries in the European Union. Paul Newton, a professor of tropical medicine and director of the clinical tropical medicine research group, the Lao - Oxford  Mahosot Hospital  Wellcome Trust Research Unit, based in Laos, says: the number of falsified medicines have risen in less developed countries due to lack of regulation for counterfeiters. However occurrences of falsified products in Europe, Australia and the United States, are relatively low when comparing with developed countries Paul Newton describes.
During the past decades counterfeit medicine has become a huge global issue. Because appropriate systems to identify falsified pharmaceutical products are not in place especially in less developed countries. It is easier for counterfeiters to market substandard medical products in less developed countries. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 10 percent of worlds drug supply is counterfeit. In 2005, the sales of counterfeit drugs amount to 39 billion US Dollars and in 2010 it was estimated at 75 billion US Dollars. It is an increase of 90 percent in five years. And 60 percent of counterfeit drug supply cases originated in less developed countries.
Impact of counterfeit medicines
Counterfeit medicines can cause serious health hazardous. For instance, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the patients were found with unusual symptoms such as protruding tongue, extended neck, facial cramps and contorted upper body after taking fake Diazepam to treat a wide range of illnesses, including malaria.
Diazepam is usually used to treat anxiety disorders, alcohol withdrawal and muscle spasms. Occasionally, doctors use it to try to control convulsions in people with malaria, if there is no alternative. The most affected people with counterfeit drugs are the poor living in developing countries. The shortage of medicines and poor access to health facilities in less developed countries causing to buy falsified or substandard medicines. For instance, the records show a higher death rate in African countries as a result of using falsified medicines.
Mick Deats, group leader at the World Health Organisation (WHO) on substandard and falsified medical products, says the clandestine nature of counterfeit medicine manufacture makes it difficult both to track down the perpetrators and quantity the extend of the problem.
Seizure of counterfeit medicines
UKs Medicines and Healthcare product Regulatory Agency (MHRA) seized 15.8 million Sterling Pounds worth counterfeit and unlicensed medicines and devices on May 18, 2015 as part of a global operation. It announced that it was the biggest recorded seizure to date in the UK. It includes huge quantities of illegally supplied and potentially harmful slimming pills, erectile dysfunction tablets, anaemia tablets and narcolepsy tablets. The UK operation also resulted in 1380 websites being closed down and 339 of which were UK websites selling unlicensed or counterfeit pills and tablets. The majority of the products seized in the UK originated from India, Hong Kong and Singapore. The MHRA said criminals were making money at the expense of peoples health and it was a growing problem. The seizures were part of Operation Pangea  an international clampdown on the illegal trade in fake medicines by 115 countries.
Sri Lanka customs destroyed 17 million Sri Lankan rupees worth contraband which included 68, 400 tablets of Rivotril imported from Pakistan and India.
In June 2013, two large boxes containing 150,000 packs of Postinor-2 were discovered at Lagos international airport by the Nigerian drug regulator. The product, a widely used emergency contraceptive containing levonorgestrel, contained no active ingredient. Similar batches have been detected in Ghana, Kenya and Angola.
But figures from the Pharmaceutical Security Industry (PSI), a US  based not-for-profit membership organisation dedicated to protecting public health, sharing information on counterfeit drugs and initiating enforcement action, suggest that no country is immune to counterfeiting. In 2015 the PSI found that while 1,100 incidents were reported in Asia, there were 779 in North America and 358 in Europe. An incidents means that a country has been identified as the origin, point of seizure or transit, or destination of illegal pharmaceuticals.
Some frequently cited statistics include the worldwide value of counterfeit medicines being around 75 billion US Dollars. According to the US Centre for Medicine in the Public Interest and a World Economic Forum estimate in 2011 that the impact on drugs manufacturers was around 200 billion US Dollars.
More recently, the European Union Intellectual Property office estimated that the EU pharmaceutical sector loses 10.2 billion Euros a year, or 4.4 per cent of sales, to counterfeit medicine. But intellectual property law expert Iain Connor of Pinsent Masons says: The value is at least 10, if not 100, times bigger than the reported figure. It proves how genuine legitimate pharmaceutical manufacturers are affected due to counterfeit medical products. Professor Paul Newton says, regulation has to improve to protect the reputations of legitimate pharmaceutical products manufacturers of both innovative and generic products.
Risk of online purchase
Counterfeiters use online marketing to sell their products at lower price mainly targeting less developed countries because, patients may be driven to purchase medicines online due to their affordability on the prices of medicine. Alastair Jeffry, the head of enforcement of Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says it is amazing to me that people will buy those types of medicines over the internet.
Technologies for patient safety
Many pharmaceutical companies implemented technologies for patient safety. For instance, Pfizer is the first pharmaceutical company to put in place this type of comprehensive programme focusing on EPC authentication as a mean deterring counterfeiting. Pfizer also uses radio frequency identification (RFID) tags on certain highly counterfeited products in order to further ensure patient safety in the United States. RFID technology enables pharmacies and wholesalers to track medicines from manufacturer to pharmacy by verifying the unique electronic product code (EPC) on the product packaging.
The governing body of Sri Lanka should take necessary arrangements to prevent the nation from counterfeiters by implementing regulations not only protect public health, but also to protect the reputation of legitimate manufacturers.

A countrywide dengue control programme will take place from March 29 to April 4 under the direction of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne. This mosquito control programme will focus on destroying all dengue mosquito breeding grounds located everywhere in order to control the increasing number of dengue cases, Health Ministry sources said.
According to sources, around 3,000 teams will take part in the National Mosquito Control week. Presidential Task Force members and health officers from the Health Ministry will be included in the teams. Entomology studies have revealed that schools, construction sites, religious institutions etc harbour most of the dengue mosquito breeding sites.
According to the Epidemiology Unit sources, 40 dengue deaths and 24,562 dengue patients had been reported during this year from all parts of the country. Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Galle, Matara, Hambantota, Baticaloa, Trincomalee, Jaffna, Kalmunai, Ratnapura and Kegalle districts have been declared as high risk districts.
Prompt medical treatment should be sought from a state hospital or from a qualified doctor if anyone has fever more than two days. No drugs other than Paracetamol should be used to control fever, the source added.

Current SL equity valuations attractive
Despite the general hawkish sentiment in the central banks of developed countries, equity markets hit record highs during February including emerging markets ,the Guardian Acuity Asset Management Equity Fund report for February shows.
The Colombo Stock Exchange also experienced a marginal recovery during February supported by positive earnings announcements.
The Central Bank keeping policy rates steady despite a gradual uptick in secondary market rates and also with Fitch rating revising Sri Lankas outlook to stable from negative.
Meanwhile foreign interest returned with a net foreign inflow of Rs 2.1 billion during the month with the notable inflows in John Keells Holdings, Hemas Holdings and Melstacorp Limited.
Accordingly ASPI closed the month with a marginal 0.03% gain. Corporate earnings releases for December quarter were encouraging with most of the counters we hold showing impressive net earnings growth, namely Sampath bank 67%.
Tokyo Cement 130%, Dialog Axiata 101%, Ceylinco Insurance 38%. Some of these stocks yet trade at low multiples and hence still carry substantial upside permitting investors who enter the fund now to secure good returns on market recovery.
Your fund recorded 0.16% return in the month of February and -0.16% year to date, outperforming the benchmark ASPI . Since the funds inception approximately five years ago, The annualised return (CAGR) was 10.75% by the end of February compared to benchmark ASPI (CAGR) return of 2.29% , amidst very subdued conditions,the report says.
Sampath Bank, Tokyo Cement, Chevron Lubricants, Dialog Axiata were the leading contributors to Funds positive return for the month whilst Aitken Spence Hotels , Hayleys Fabric and Ceylicno Insurance were the main detractors. Given the volatility in the market we remain focused on companies with substantial discount to their intrinsic value and stable growth in earnings. We expect the macro economy to stabilise towards the latter part of the year which should improve sentiment for the local investors . The report also says current drought experienced by the country and its impact on the economy, however current valuations level are very attractive compared to historical and peer countries multiples.
The Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by 1.2% against the US dollar during the year up to 22 March 2017according to the Central Bank.

Discussions on to bolster regulatory capital levels: Peoples Bank Group posts  Rs 18 bn profit in 2016
Peoples Bank declared an impressive financial performance for the financial year 2016, showcasing a striking upward trajectory in the Groups performance.
The Group posted a Profit Before Tax of Rs 25.4 bn, an incline of 5.4%. The Groups also posted a Profit After Tax of Rs 18 bn, inclining from Rs 15.1 bn .
Peoples Bank Group Chairman Hemasiri Fernando said the Groups results exampled the Groups astute journey within the fast-evolving financial services industry, maintaining an insistent focus on every stakeholder.
Our results are self-attesting to an unrelenting pursuit to add consistent value for the benefit of all our stakeholders. Needless be said, market circumstances in 2016 were challenging and from a macro-economic stand-point, these included, inflationary pressures and a tightening monetary policy which led to a rise in interest rates and high earnings pressure.
The total gross income reached all-time record performance at Rs 144.7 bn, a 16.9% growth compared to Rs 123.8 bn at end 2015. Net surpluses were well evident across all aspects of investment operations with revaluation and available for sale reserves posted at Rs 11.9 bn and Rs 0.3 bn respectively.
The Groups Return on Average Equity was 22.7% compared to last years 22%, while the total contribution via taxation, special levies and dividends reflect the integral role the Group plays in national economic development, with its Rs 22.9 bn contribution, once again considerably higher than last years Rs 19.5 bn. CEO and General Manager Vasantha Kumar says, Its been one of continuous positive improvement across several aspects of business operations both quantitative and qualitative.
It was a year that witnessed two LKR 1 Tn feats in a single year - the first for any Bank, a gross income generating capability cross the LKR 140 billion mark, a loan book composition further improved and a gross non-performing loan ratio reaching a ten year low - the latter evidencing a further improved risk management framework and collection & recovery process.
This is well evidenced in the ten year low Gross NPL ratio of 1.9% (which in 2015 was 2.4%) highlighting the hallmark consistency that Peoples Bank has continued to espouse and also a total asset base of Rs 1.4 Tn, which is an 11.6% growth over Rs 1.3 Tn at end 2015.
In analysing the Groups Capital Adequacy Ratio of 13% with a Tier I ratio or 11.1% and the Banks CAR of 12.1% and 9.8% respectively, Fernando clarifies that, In terms of near-term goals, bolstering our regulatory capital levels remains a priority and a work in process.
Ongoing discussions with the Public Enterprise Development Ministry and the recent cabinet approval received to amend the Peoples Bank act are viewed very positively in this connection.

Expack embarks on mission to  create social value
Packaging solutions provider, Expack aware of the important of creating social value beyond CSR has amplified its community engagement activities.
Expack has engaged with community leaders, religious leaders and public authorities to identify the needs of the community and understand what kind of challenges they face in the area.
Health issues and waste management were two recurring problems in the vicinity. Apart from its CSR projects, Expack embarked on long-term community engagement activities to help create shared value both for the community and for the business.
With the support of the community, Expack sprung into action. Expack Medi Care is one of its longstanding efforts and has been hailed with enthusiasm and gratitude by the residents in the area. For the past sixyears, this regular medical clinic has more than treated 30,000 patients and dispensed doctor's services and medicine, completely free of charge. Another issue which was earmarked was the issue of frequent flooding during heavy rain and waste management.
Expack sponsored a kilometre long drain to help the residents of Pattiwila avoid flooding during the monsoons. During the heavy floods, last year, Expack helped ease some of the effects by supporting the flood-affected community with financial assistance and dry ration provisions.
A community notice board and a waste management program to help keep the area clean were also community engagements efforts undertaken. Seeing the lack of a bus shelter in the locality, the company stepped in to build one for the ease of daily commuters who must brave the temperamental weather during their travels.
Robust community engagement practices help build public trust and a sense of civic consciousness and citizenship is vital for Sri Lankan businesses.Small steps to create social value have large ripple effects and businesses should avoid the insular mind set of focusing purely on profits and forgetting about the community it works in and dismissing what kind of social returns it gives back to the public.
Expack believes that the social progress of the community it operates in will ultimately create a better society at large and impact the business favourably.

Federer blows past del Potro into Miami fourth round
Miami: In-form Roger Federer powered his way into the fourth round of the Miami Open with a 6-3 6-4 win over Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro on Monday.
Del Potro always enjoys plenty of crowd support in Miami, which has a large Argentine community, and it was the same story again with football-style chants of support ringing out for the 28-year-old on a packed Crandon Park center court.
It was the pair's first meeting since 2013 and having won 15 of the previous 21 encounters, Federer was favorite - but the crowd factor gave the third round match an added edge.
"Shortly before I walked out to the court you could sense the atmosphere. That's when I told myself, Just be prepared for something different, you know. It was different," Federer said.
He was forced to save four break points in the first set but he got ahead with a thundering forehand to take a 5-3 lead and served out for the set.
The Argentine had a chance to turn things around when he had a break point when down 4-3 in the second set but Federer, moving well and looking full of confidence, held firm and wrapped up the match in one hour and 22 minutes.
"I felt like I was in control and I was able to generate more chances than he did," Federer said.
"I felt like he got his chances a little bit out of nowhere, maybe because I dropped my level ever so slightly and gave him few easy points, and that's how he sort of got more chances on my serve.
"I feel like I earned it more. I was more the aggressor. It was more on my racquet, and I like it that way," added the Swiss, who won his 18th Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January.
Federer, whose successful return from a six-month injury layoff has also included a win at Indian Wells this month, will face 14th seeded Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut in the next round.
Federer's compatriot and top-seed Stan Wawrinka defeated Tunisian Malek Jaziri 6-3, 6-4.
Wawrinka saved all six break points he faced and converted two of his four break opportunities and will now face Alexander Zverev of Germany in the fourth round on Tuesday.
Zverev pulled off a remarkable win over American John Isner, saving three match points as he came back from a set down to triumph 6-7 (5/7), 7-6 (9/7), 7-6 (7/5)
Czech Tomas Berdych, Miami finalist in 2010, defeated Gilles Muller 6-3, 6-4 while Australia's Nick Kyrgios held off a strong effort from big serving Croat Ivo Karlovic on the way to a 6-4, 6-7 (4-7), 7-6 (7-2) win.
Kyrgios will play Belgian David Goffin, who narrowly edged a three-set thriller against Argentine Diego Schwartzmann. - AFP

Fishermen Livelihood Support Society joins hands with HelpAge
In an effort to improve the health and eye condition of underprivileged elderly citizens living among fisher families in Negombo and Surrounding villages, the Negombo Fishermen Livelihood support Society (FLSS) extended financial assistance to HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) for conducting Mobile Medical and Eye Care Camps.
Accordingly, the HelpAge Mobile Medical Unit (MMU) which consisted with a doctor, an optometrist, a nurse and supporting staff conducted medical camps at Wellaweediya and Pitipana in Negombo and Dikkovita in Wattala during the past few weeks.
The medical camps benefitted approximately 453 elders who were between the age group of 55 to 81 years. They were mainly screened for non- communicable diseases, eye diseases and for various other vision disabilities.
Thirty one patients were directed to HelpAge Eye Hospital at Sinsapa Road, Wellawatta to undergo free cataract surgeries, while other patients received medicines for various eye ailments. Patients who had low vision received high quality bifocal glasses from the HelpAge MMU.
In addition, large number of elderly people had their eyes tested free of charge by the HelpAge MMU. Patients who were unable to visit HelpAge Eye Hospital at Wellawatta , were referred to Government hospitals in the Negombo area for treatments with grants given by the HelpAge.
Project Manager, Fishermen livelihood Support Society Ranjan Fonseka said over the years , HelpAge Sri Lanka extended immense support to Senior Citizens in the country as a responsible institution and his Society was pleased to be part of this worthy cause.
He said his Society donated funds towards the programme under its Corporate Social Responsibility Fund and wish to conduct more medical and eye camps in the years to come. A number of Society officials attended the camps.
While highlighting the free cataract surgery programme , HASL, Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge said over 27,000 elders in the country have already benefitted under this programme from the inception of HelpAge Sri Lanka.
He also thanked the Society for their kind gesture extended towards a valuable programme and said HASL always uses donations to conduct cataract surgeries, medical and eye screening programmes and also to provide free spectacles for needy Senior Citizens.
He said there is a marked improvement in contributions made by private sector and individual donors towards the countrys health and eye care sector and thanked Fishermen livelihood Support Society, Project Manager Ranjan Fonseka and the Society management for partnering in this worthy cause.

## Title: Food security in a global economy

Food security in a global economy
In April 2010 an Icelandic volcano that goes under the name of Eyfajallajokull erupted and wrought havoc in the airline industry. Hundreds of flights operated to and from Europe were cancelled or diverted elsewhere as flying was deemed too dangerous due to the thick smoke emitted by the volcano.
One effect of the cancellation of this air travel was the disruption caused by the eruption to global air cargo and particularly to the exports and imports of food products. Many African countries such as Kenya, Uganda and Zambia were badly affected, being unable to air freight their exports of vegetables to their primary markets in Western Europe. Britain and other developed nations also experienced shortages of fresh food while Persian Gulf nations who relied entirely on imports saw their stocks of food rapidly depleting.
This volcanic eruption provided an insight into the real risks faced by humanity if at any stage food security was compromised.
Surrender through starvation
The traditional view of what constitutes Security has always been dominated by military and strategic considerations. In fact, since the earliest of times, food has been considered a strategic factor which can determine the outcome of a conflict.
While it did not go under the name of food security in earlier times, siege warfare which was practiced all over the world and throughout history, was a way of preventing the other side from getting access to vital provisions, of which food played the most important part. The objective of this tactic was to force surrender by subjecting the opposing side to starvation.
In two world wars, Germany tried and failed to bring Great Britain to her knees by blockading the UK with an almost successful submarine warfare campaign. Had Britain surrendered due to the loss of food security and been reduced to starvation, the course of world history would have been any different.
Revolutions in Russia and China
What is therefore clear is that any country, even a world power, will need to achieve and sustain a certain quantum of food security to ensure that it has the capability of operating independently on the world arena. Food security is a very good measure of economic strength and political capabilities.
Economists and historians have long understood that there is a strong nexus that exists between food insecurity and political and social upheavals. Good examples of these including the many wars and revolutions that have taken place all around the world. Failure to ensure food security was a determining factor that led to revolutions in Russia in 1917 and China in 1949.
Around the early 1990s in the wake of the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, a new area of study called Soft Security was formulated which covered strategic concerns in areas such as information, knowledge and food security. The security rating of a country had moved away from a measure of how many tanks, bombers or missiles that a country could deploy, to one where economic considerations had become the main measure of power. In this light, food security had emerged as a major factor in assessing a countrys strategic power.
However, it can be argued that in today context, food insecurity represents a lesser threat than at any previous time in history. The Expo Milano 2015 which was held in that Italian city for six months, focused heavily on food security. Its central theme was feeding the planet.
Sri Lanka did participate at Expo Milan hosting a pavilion where leading State agencies held exhibitions to promote the country in the areas of trade, tourism and investment.
The importance of food security was highlighted and given much prominence by the Italian Government. In 2015 the United Nations General Assembly also identified food security as one of its key development goals.
The other development goals of the UN being for humanity to achieve at a global level universal primary education, gender equality, reduce child mortality, improve material health, combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, to ensure environmental sustainability and to develop global partnerships for development.
Climate changes and economic forces
New global considerations have arisen and the agenda on food security now covers such issues as the Right to Food and proper nutrition. In the context of globalization this will impact considerably on relations between states, since countries which have food security will be now compelled to help those that have not achieved that capacity.
Some of the mitigating factors that have positively impacted on food security are the many advances achieved in biotechnology which have given humanity the capacity to overcome challenges such as national limitation, climate changes and economic forces.
Some of the advances in biotechnology include the possibility of selecting and eradicating diseases affecting plants and protecting seeds with biological agents.
It is therefore gratifying to note that today most of the planet is fed and it can be said that food security has been achieved globally to a large extent.
Currently the FAO estimates that 842 million people in the world are underfed (12% of the global population). While this means that still 3.1 million children die as a result of malnutrition, and 300 million continue to go to bed hungry each night, the problem of food security has been largely addressed.
Food security is also a complex issue since even the most developed states have pockets of malnutrition. US authorities reported in 2012 that 85% of the American population was food secure, which would mean that the remaining 15% of Americans experience some form of hunger on a daily basis.
The Milan Charter was formulated and based on issues also discussed in the Expo Milano 2015. It placed considerable emphasis on bringing together the worlds citizens to re-examine issue relating to food consumption and food security.
The Milan Charter also called on the international community to address these problems and also to measure progress in improving the global food system.
The problem of food security today is not just about feeding the 800 million hungry people, but also to prevent future conflicts that may be caused by deprivation in food and nutrition.
Also experts need to make the Right to Food a universal value because currently many countries are not signatories to any treaty protecting that right.
To conclude it can be said that food Security is now an integral part of the agenda to achieve globalization and efforts should be made to tap the goodwill that exists to address whatever shortcoming that may exist in this area.

Foreign judges is neither the sole obsession of govt.nor intl community: FM
Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said having foreign judges to investigate alleged war crimes is neither the sole obsession of the government nor the international community.
He was addressing the media yesterday at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.We remember in 2014 when the international community decided to call for an international investigation in Sri Lanka, only 12 countries stood by our country. This time there was no division or accusations while country after country praised the government and 47 countries offered support to Sri Lanka,he said.
Minister Samaraweera said that the countries that spoke bestowing their trust in the Sri Lankan government include the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.
He further said that the election manifesto clearly states that a domestic inquiry will be set up to look into alleged crimes committed during the countrys civil war.
When the new government was formed, I requested the UN to allow us to have a domestic inquiry. We said we will produce the road map in September to show the way in which transitional justice will be implemented. They accepted our request and the plan. We are making a progress since October 2015. We again requested that we need more two years and they willingly agreed to it, he said.
When asked whether the new Constitution will allow the appointment of foreign judges, Minister Samaraweera said that Sri Lanka is not bound to adhere to the resolution as it is a sovereign state.
Under the system we promoted in 2015 as a sovereign country, the final decision is ours, the UN resolution is not something carved on stone. We will have to decide what we can do and what we cannot do. While taking such decisions, we have to keep the interest of all the stake holders, not only the victims and perpetrators,he said.
In the past, it was a straw that broke the camels back.We dont want this camel to break its back in the near future. We wish to continue to do the good things that we had been doing.
Speaking about President Maithripala Sirisenas recent visit to Russia, Minister Samaraweera said it is an important land mark in our diplomatic history where international relations are concerned under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He added that in Geneva, the Human Rights Council upheld and reaffirmed its trust and confidence in Sri Lanka to be in charge of its own reconciliation process.

Former CBSL Governor's reasons questionable
The reasons given to the Tender Board by former CBSL Governor Arjun Mahendarn on the decision to accept 10.5 billion worth bids at the questioned Treasury Bond auction is debatable, the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue yesterday observed.
This observation was made when Deputy Governor ex-officio Tender Board Chairman P. Samarasiri explained details on the Tender Board meeting which was held on February 27, 2015.
Samarasiri commenting on the observation said every economic theory in fact is debatable.
Samarasiri explained to the Presidential Commission the telephone conversation he had with the former Governor Mahendran during the said Tender Board meeting with which he sought Mahendrans reasoning to the questioned instructions.
The former Governor said, we are going to remove 5% penal interest rate, once this is removed the interest rate structure will be brought back to pre 2014 September level. These are very technical reasons.He also said there is a lot of liquidity in the market and that the government has a borrowing requirement, Samarasiri said.
Samarasiri also said when the Public Debt Department officials conveyed to him that former Governor Mahendran has instructed to accept 10 times the amount of bids advertised in the public notice, he felt angry.
Asked as to why he felt angry, Samarasiri said he felt angry because the other two Deputy Governors have accompanied the Governor to the PDD and have brought instructions to the Tender Board.
So I asked if a Governor can take decisions, what would be the purpose of having a Tender Board in the first place, Samarasiri said.
The Commission requested Samarasiri to explain his hypothesis as to why former Governor Mahendran did not directly communicate on the thirty year Treasury bond issuance to him, who happened to be the DG overlooking the PDD.
Samarasiri said during his long period in office as a public servant in the CBSL, he did not do morning visits to any Governors office. Maybe that is why I was communicated on this via another Deputy Governor, Samarasiri said to the amusement of the audience present at the Commission.
Meanwhile asked on the amendments he had done to the Monetary Board minutes prepared by Secretary to the Monetary Board H.A. Karunaratne, DG Samarasiri said he did make some changes in order to put the decisions and the Governor in a better light. Samarasiri said the amendments were done based upon the impressions that he had on the discussion.
He also said he found Karunaratnes minute keeping being not up to the standard.
According to the Monetary Law Act, the minutes of the Tender Board are the responsibility of the Governor. The Deputy Governors are there to assist the secretary to the Monetary Board to prepare minutes, he said.
Samarasiri was also asked whether the Tender Board decision was not a unanimous decision regarding the questioned Treasury bond issuance. He replied that unless the Tender Board members voiced their concerns, a Governors decision is the Tender Boards decision as well.
Additional Solociter General Yasantha Kodagoda asked if any member of the Tender Board voiced their serious concerns regarding Mahendrans decision, Samarasiri said there was not much confrontation apart from Dr.Asim and ASPD Mutugala who requested to contact Governor Mahendran on the matter.
ASG Kodagoda asked if AG S.S. Ratnayake voiced his serious concerns regarding the matter. Samarasiri said there was no such confrontation.
ASG Kodagoda then asked Samarasiri if S.S.Ratnayake said that it would have been better if they were shot at or they were pressed to walk naked than agreeing with the decision, Samarasiri said he was very sure that Ratnayake did not say anything as such at the said Tender Board meeting.
The Commission also asked whether Samarasiri was aware that the Perpetual Treasuries CEO Arjun Alosius was the son-in-law of former Governor Mahendran. Samarasiri said he did not know until the media broke the news after the questioned Treasury bond auction.
The Assistant Governor S.S.Ratnayake is to appear before the Presidential Commission today.
Additional Solociter General Yasantha Kodagoda and Senior State Counselor Dr.Avanti Perera led evidence.

Fulfilling prawn crazy cravings
Since opening up their doors to prawn lovers last year, ISSO has left its mark as a favourite go-to quick service restaurant in Colombo. Conveniently located down Sulaiman Terrace off Jawatta Road, this year, the restaurant celebrates its first anniversary in business. Their success as one of the most talked-about food joints is vastly owing to their unique menu offering which consists of all things prawn and is an ideal pick for those looking to indulge in mouthwatering prawn dishes.
Another aspect that adds to the uniqueness of ISSO is the option they offer its visitors to customize their order. Visitors can select the size and style of their dishes, and pick the carb of their preference to complete the combo. Additionally, each combo is also served with a complimentary salad to go on the side.
When we started ISSO last year, what we wanted was to offer a novel food experience to our customers; and ISSO being a prawn-centric restaurant was a first in Sri Lanka. We also wanted to make our menu intriguing by letting our customers choose their own combinations for their meals. So we came up with a few interesting variations under the size, style and carb options, allowing our customers have access to a wide number of combos which they can customize. Through this we have been able to tap into different palettes with a variety of cuisines successfully, Co-Founders of ISSO Apinash Sivagumaaran, Fawaz Fassi and Shuaib Yusoof said.
During the past year we have been able to progressively grow, improve and strengthen our relationships with our customers. I think its safe to say, we are happy with how far we have come. Going forward we want to introduce a menu that has been inspired by different cuisines to give our customers a taste of prawn dishes from all over the world, be it Sri Lankan, Italian, Japanese, Indian and so on they added.
The restaurant is also famed for its reinventions of traditional Sri Lankan foods such as the beloved local street food Isso Waday and the Jaffna Prawn Curry. ISSOs Sweet Potato Fries, which took Colombo by storm when introduced is its most popular side option.
ISSO, which has been ranked among the top 5 restaurants in Colombo for 2017 by TripAdvisor, prides itself on the quality of its food. The ingredients that are used to prepare the food are carefully selected and the prawns, which are only of export quality, are guaranteed to be fresh, succulent and appealing to taste buds.
The outlet ambience is ideal to grab a quick meal with friends or family, with both indoor and outdoor seating. Customers also have the convenience of a take-out option and ISSO also offers free delivery within Colombo city limits.

GMOA threatens biggest ever strike
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) along with 63 other trade unions will launch the biggest strike ever in the countrys history if the Government does not solve the SAITM issue by next Monday (April 3), GMOA Secretary Dr.Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that some Cabinet Ministers are misusing their official powers to safeguard certain people and not to safeguard the patients right to life. When the current President held the Health Minister portfolio, he clearly and firmly expressed his stand on SAITM and it is expected that he will do the same now. On January 8,2015 President Maithripala Sirisena promised to end bribery, corruption, malpractices, etc, the GMOA Secretary said. The Government, especially the Health Minister and the Higher Education Minister should take the sole responsibility for patients having to undergo various difficulties due to the strike because it is they who are responsible for failing to carry out their official duties to the letter and safeguard the lives of patients, Dr.Zoysa alleged.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr.Haritha Aluthge said the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) is the top Technical Committee in the country when it comes to setting the standard of medical education.

Gotabaya undecided on entering politics; says hes studying Trump
War crime investigations backed by some Western countries and the United Nations will exacerbate the differences between Sri Lankas two main ethnic groups instead of uniting them, former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa said.
Gotabaya made this comments four days after the U.N. Human Rights Council said Sri Lanka must make more progress towards meeting commitments to establishing a credible investigation into alleged war crimes during the countrys civil war.
The United Nations originally asked Sri Lanka to have foreign judges run the war crime probe focusing particularly on the last few days of the conflict. But President Maithripala Sirisena later said he would not agree to having foreign judges.
How can you talk about investigations and foreign judges at the same time bringing these communities together he told the Foreign Correspondents Association of Sri Lanka late on Monday.
By trying to do these things, you only try to bring people apart. If you think like that, there wont be reconciliation at all. After a war, what can we do Going back and harping on these things will never bring communities together. That will widen the gap.
He also said that when Tamils talk about war crime probes, ethnic majority Sinhalese speak of the massacre of Buddhist priests and police and the horrors they experienced during the war, and that that could slow the postwar healing process.
The government has already launched some related investigations into alleged war crimes, but ethnic-minority Tamils have complained about the sluggish pace of probes.
On allegations of huge casualties in the war, ranging from 40,000 to 150,000, Gotabaya said that empirical evidence does not support these figures. The Government Census Department had done a survey which revealed a death toll of 7,000 to 8,000. UNICEF had done an independent survey which did not support the allegations. Even the UN has not officially put out the figure of 40,000 killed.
Data available with the World Food Program and the District Government Agents had indicated a population of 300,000 in the war zone out of which most crossed over to the government side and were lodged in camps.
Asked about forced disappearances, he said that the allegations need to be investigated, and for that, people need to give credible evidence and identify the perpetrators, things which are lacking now. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the most influential government officer in the Rajapaksa government, also hinted at a possible entry into active politics in future.
I have not decided yet, he told foreign correspondents here, without ruling out the option. A few of his supporters have been floating the idea of his presidential candidacy in 2020.
If I can do something for the country, I will do that. I have that capability and I have proved it  whether during the war or in urban development. I did what nobody had done, said the brother of ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who led the armed forces against the LTTE.
He was willing to work with a leader whose policies were agreeable, he said.
With regard to allegations of top-secret death squads during the Rajapaksa regime, Gotabaya said there were no such units while claiming that a lot of things happened without my knowledge.
He added that he was working more at the policy and strategy-level and not on things at the tactical-level. Observing that he had never been a politician, unlike his family members who had been in politics since 1935, he said: But Donald Trump has come from business. We have to see.
Asked if he considered the U.S. President a model, he said: Yes, I am looking at him and studying him. The Hindu

An ideal human being
As a result of a series of discussions ensued between two scholars in India, there resulted a compendium of five brilliant research papers on the concept of man. The year happened to be 1995, and the two scholars Dr Sarvapalli Radahkrishnan and Dr P T Raja of Rajasthan University, Jodhpur in India. The concept of Man embraces five topics covered by the various aspects of human existence which goes as The Concept of Man in Great Thought as researched by Professor John Wild of Harvard University, USA, The Concept of Man in Jewish Thought, as researched by Professor A J Heschel of the Jewish Theological Seminary, New York, The Concept of Man in Chinese Thought by Professor W T Chan of Dartmouth University, The Concept of Man in Indian Though by Dr P T Rajan and in conclusion a summary of comparisons and reflection on the selected topics that go as the concept of the ideal man, the man, and nature man at society.
The reader gets a chance to obtaining a glimpse of the concept of man in the human existence. As the learned scholar at the outset points out, the Commonwealth of humanity has no written constitution, it is based on community of ideals, freedom and dignity of the individual, rule of law, economic opportunity for all citizens and love and peace. Radhakrishnan traces the various standpoints of human evolution in order to demarcate the concept of the accepted concept and thought and brought down the centuries human evolution.
The preparatory remarks of Radhakrishnan adds light to the articles that follow in the understanding of social, political and spiritual aspect of the man as a living being over a short span of life. The scholar Radhakrishnan attempts to uncover the genesis of such concepts of democracy, autocracy and aristocracy as against the various governing rules of law extended by the east during his life span.
In the research of John Wild on t eh concept of man in Greek though, a survey of view follows on the teachings of such thinkers as Socrates, Plato and Aristotle down the centuries. The influence of the thinking f these three thinkers had spread around the work to the extent that the same teachings have implanted a sense of existence in most countries in the research by A J Heschel on the concept of man in Jewish Thought, much material is drawn from his own three works which appeared as pioneer insights on the topic. They are Man is not alone, Mans quest for God, and God in search of Man. The most significant area in the research is the response to the head of god and the paradox of divine concern. Both centre round the mans quest for a better sense of living as against all conditions and cruelties that make the man miserable. It is debatable, whether the god could be believe as helpful or not whether the man could gain any higher standard of living via the praying conditions to god. Whatever it is the belief centres round quite a number of human standpoint.
W T Chan in his survey on the concept of man in Chinese thought states at the outset that whether a Chinese or a Confucisionist or a Taoist a conservative or a radical scholar or an illiterate he is a humanist. To him, man is the measure of all things. Man is made to believe in himself and not on any power struggle that lay beyond. As such initially an attempt is made to depict how the man becomes a strong image in his own living tradition and culture. While drawing material from quite a number of ancient Chinese songs, the scholar Chan drives a strong point on the man as the strongest and most knowledgeable living creations on the earth. This is followed by the concept of man in Indian thought by Dr Rajan. The scholar goes to the distant past to trace the standpoint of man in such civilizations as Mohendajaro at Indus valley bringing to light various factor pertaining to the topic, which cover the man in Vedic concept, Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism. The scholar Rajan tries to expose the image of man as taught by the Buddha in his sermons mostly retraced by later monks.
In Tripitaka, he compares the image of man as taught by the Buddha as the best example of creativity and skill that are born as a result of ones own diligence as perseverance, unsurpassable from other points of view. In conclusion he states that the missionary real of Buddhism had vision to the point that it resulted in the Bodhisatta ideal, the supreme state of the concept of the man in existence.
The man in Bodhisatva has to perform certain purifications called Paramita in order to achieve the highest goal in the existence.
In the concluding chapter titled as Comparisons and Reflections, the reader is made to feel that the concept of man as laid down by the greatest philosophers of the world go to state the dictum that goes as Man, know thyself.
This may be said to be the first advice of all human traditions.

India to focus on blue economy  during Bangladesh PM's visit
India and Bangladesh are expected to unveil a joint roadmap for cooperation in the Bay of Bengal region during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to India next month.
This is in keeping with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's initiative to develop blue economy partnerships with the littoral states of the Indian Ocean Region to harness maritime resources and ensure peace.
The two neighbours are likely to sign their first comprehensive defence cooperation agreement during Hasina's trip, from April 7 to 10, which will help maintain peace in the common maritime region in Bay of Bengal amid an increase in terrorism and presence of extraregional powers, people aware of the matter told ET.
"In the maritime domain, cooperation in the blue economy in the Bay of Bengal has opened new opportunities for both the countries. It is also the shared responsibility of both the countries that our common maritime region in the Bay of Bengal remains peaceful so as to harness the potential of blue economy," said one of the persons, who did not wish to be identified.
"India and Bangladesh can develop a joint roadmap of blue economy cooperation and help each other in developing capacity in this emerging field."
Prime Minister Modi's blue economy initiative launched in 2015 is a multi-disciplinary approach for the exploitation of hydrocarbons and other marine resources, deep sea fishing, preservation of marine ecology, mitigating climate change by addressing environmental issues and disaster management. With its advancement in science and technology, India is in a position to lend expertise in deep sea bed activities, hydrographic surveys and weather predictions, the person said.
The Bay of Bengal leads to the Indian Ocean Region, which has several vital sea lanes of communication passing through it from the Hormuz Strait to the Suez Canal, Red Sea, Persian Gulf and Malacca Strait, extending up to the South China Sea. Security partnerships among the countries in the region, therefore, assume importance. India has launched blue economy initiatives with Seychelles, Mauritius and Sri Lanka, among other nations in the Indian Ocean Region.
Last year, NITI Aayog had launched a consultation process for integrating defence and internalsecurity with a 15-year vision, and initiated a discussion to leverage India's status as a major maritime nation with a long coastline and the potential to become a significant blue economy.
India has more than 7,500 km of coastline, more than 2 million sq km of exclusive economic zone, more than 1,300 islands and network of rivers. Maritime trade accounts for about 75 per cent value and more than 90 per cent of volume of Indian trade, and the country is blessed with a strategic location within the Indian Ocean Region.(economictimes.indiatimes.com)

The presentation delivered a message of better returns in Sri Lanka compared to the ANZ and regional context, and helped address concerns overseas investors may have with regards to the ease of entry and exit into the Sri Lankan capital market. Stockbroking Firms and Unit Trust Companies present at the events further engaged and pitched capital market investment to participants who sought further clarity on the process of investing in Sri Lanka.
The capital market pitch was backed by a strong commitment made by the SEC to secure the complete trust and confidence of the issuing and investing public by creating a level playing field for all. SEC Director General Vajira Wijegunerwardane speaking at the events stated that far reaching reforms implemented by the SEC over the medium to long term are expected to reclassify Sri Lanka as a Modern Index Strategy Indexes (MSCI) emerging market from the present status of a frontier market, which would offer Sri Lanka broader visibility as an attractive portfolio investment destination.
He also went on to express confidence in the prospects for the market beyond 2017, and stated that the capital market of Sri Lanka has demonstrated its resilience time and again; whether in the face of sustained global economic and market uncertainty, or of divergent growth, volatility, or the many other challenges it has encountered in the past.
Eager to take part in Sri Lankan growth
Participants at both events were appreciative of the effort made by the organizers to present Sri Lankan opportunities and ways in which they could contribute to the countrys growth. Interaction before and after the events and opinions expressed by participants translated a keen interest in contributing to the development effort and an already strong association with the country. Several individuals with an investment and business interest across a number of industries in Sri Lanka, which also included Australian and other foreign nationals, endorsed the strong investment potential of Sri Lanka and called for added reforms to create a facilitative and business friendly environment to attract further investment going forward.
The events focused on Sri Lankans living in Melbourne and Auckland marked the final leg of the capital market investment promotion effort in Australia and New Zealand, and followed fund manager and Australian investor focused events conducted in Sydney and Melbourne.
The Sri Lankan delegation led by State Minister Niroshan Perera included CSE Chairman Vajira Kulatilaka, SEC Director General Vajira Wijegunerwardane, Fitch Ratings Lanka MD and Country Head Maninda Wickramasinghe, Dr. (Mrs.) Yuthika Indraratne, Central Bank's Economic Research Director, CSE CEO Rajeeva Bandaranaike and representatives of Sri Lankan Stockbroking and Unit Trust Companies.
The events also featured several leading Real Estate developments in Sri Lanka in the capacity of event sponsors, including the Colombo Port City (Platinum Sponsor) One Galle Face by Shangri-La Hotels & Resorts (Platinum Sponsor) and the luxury apartment development by Altair (Corporate Sponsor).

Jealousy amongst people prevents development: Duminda
The majority in this country listen to bana preaching on every Poya day and observe sil. Millions view dhamma programs through electronic media, but they are jealous of others and prevent the others becoming prosperous, Agriculture Minister and SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissananayake said.
He was addressing a public meeting following the commencement of the overall rehabilitation of the road running from track 6 Angamuwa up to Rajangane fishery village.
The minister said peoples jealously towards each other is the reason why the country is still under-developed and cornered among other nations. If a politician blocked development in a village just because a majority in that village were against his party and policies, it was not justifiable at all, the minister said.
He said he settled the personal issues with those involved in them and dedicatedly worked to upgrade the village infra-tructural facilities.
The minister said he would take steps to promote the Rajangane fisheries village on the concept of village with a tank similar to that of tank and the dagoba theory. Uncultivated plots of land are being distributed among the youths in Rajangane irrespective of their party politics to enable them to cultivate under a lift irrigation system. It is true that Mahinda Rajapaksha served the country immensely. But he is barred from contesting the presidential elections again in terms of the constitutional laws. Is it proper SLFP supporters to go after him for nothing
We shall definitely have a strong presidential candidates. The laws are not changed. In this background, it is fruitless to support to promote a person to be President not allowed in the law, the minister said.
Minister Duminda said those who were shouting with crocodile tears, pretending that they were the saviours of the people were opportunists and hypocrites. He asked people not to get misled or misguided by them.

Kerber books clash with Venus as Cibulkova, Muguruza ousted
Miami: World number one Angelique Kerber despatched Japanese qualifier Risa Ozaki 6-2, 6-2 to set up a quarter-final clash with Venus Williams Monday at the Miami Open.
Seven-time Grand Slam champion Williams fought past Russian seventh-seed Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) to reach the last eight.
Fourth-seed Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia crashed out to the Czech Republic's Lucie Safarova and ailing French Open champion Garbine Muguruza also bowed out in the fourth round.
Kerber took charge early, breaking twice to establish a 4-1 lead and she was in firm control from then on.
The German said that while her opponent may only have been ranked 87th she had studied Ozaki's game closely before the contest.
"She came through the qualies, she beat good players, so I was ready for it, Kerber said.
I talked with my team and I knew that she's moving good and bringing a lot of balls back. I was trying to play my game and be aggressive."
Williams cruised through the first set before Kuznetsova, a two-time Grand Slam champion and runner-up at Indian Wells last week, fought back to take the second set to a tie-break.
It was a fierce battle for the decisive points, Kuznetsova going 4-1 up, but after two lengthy rallies, both of which were won by the 36-year-old Williams, the oldest player in the tournament emerged victorious.
The victory, sealed with a delicate slice at the net, was Williams' first against a top 10 opponent since 2015. - AFP

Lankan cricket in shambles and the shame of the ICC
Sri Lanka cricket is certainly not going through good times especially on the cricket field and to make matters worse off it as well. It is a well known fact that if the national team does not perform well criticism will be leveled at the administration and issues which may not surface with a winning team will come to light when they are losing.
When Sri Lanka defeated Australia 3-0 in the Test series everyone thought that this rebuilding side was going to be the dream team that could go and win the World Cup in another two years. But the way things have been panning out that win now seems like a flash in the pan after what we have gone through since then.
A 2-0 Test win and emerging champions of the one-day tri-nations in Zimbabwe with a young side was overshadowed heavily when Sri Lanka were whitewashed 3-0 and 5-0 in the Test and ODI series respectively in South Africa. They managed to save some grace by winning the T20 series in South Africa and following it up with a similar victory in Australia.
But come Bangladesh the youngest Test nation to Sri Lanka and what have we Sri Lanka won the first Test at Galle convincingly and when everyone thought that they would wrap it up at the P Sara Oval, the visitors sprung a surprise with a stunning win  their first against Sri Lanka and thereby shared the two-Test series.
We currently have the three-match one-day series going and Bangladesh notwithstanding their maiden Test triumph over Sri Lanka have carried that momentum into the shorter version and taken a 1-0 lead with a crushing 90-run win at Dambulla thereby giving themselves an outside chance of creating history for the second time by winning a ODI series against Sri Lanka for the first time.
While all this has been taking place with the countrys cricket in a dilemma, comes the damning exposure of Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala trying to sneak in through the back door to fill in the vacancy created by the resignation of ICC chairman Shahank Manohar of India.
The over ambitions of the SLC presidents hands were glaringly exposed when he put his hat in the ring a move which the rest of the ICC full members objected to strongly.
Heres how Sumathipalas over ambitious move was reported by ESPN Cricinfo:
According to ICC rules, if an existing chairman quits before finishing his tenure, the board picks an interim replacement from among the directors. One man who put his hat in his ring was SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala. However, the rest of the board was firmly in opposition.
One director was surprised by Sumathipala's move. "It would have been terribly difficult for anybody, and what we did not want was to have a whole load of toxic electioneering which Sumathipala exemplified. His conduct actually brought the board very fast together."
A senior official from another Full Member board was concerned the board could not invest time in choosing an interim chairman when it was about to usher in such wide-ranging reforms. "This is what I was most concerned about: while we were discussing the changes, it was the wrong time to think of a new chairman because invariably that position has been fought for by people with aspirations. Then the horse-trading and everything else becomes a mess. We don't need that at this juncture. It is absolutely the wrong time.
"In the end you would get reforms with massive compromise because to get Member X's vote you need to forego this particular thing, to get Member Y you need to increase this, to get Member Z you need to do something else. Then you will get their support. That is not the way to run an organisation.
By this egotistical act to desperately get into the portals of the ICC, the SLC president has shamed the entire country by his act and become a laughing stock in the eyes of the entire cricket world.
As if the humiliation the country is going through on the cricket field at the hands of the youngest full member of the ICC Bangladesh is not enough, here we have an uncalled for situation which is only adding more salt to an already festering wound.
Its a case of one mans ego to take over and run the ICC like he is doing the SLC that is destroying the very foundations of the game at home. Thankfully the ICC escaped that from happening to them because saner counsel prevailed.

McLarens Group first to unveil strategic move to Microsoft azure disaster recovery
McLarens Group recently added to its track record as the first in Sri Lankas shipping industry to unveil a strategic move to cloud-based Microsoft Azure for their complete disaster recovery needs with leading enterprise IT solutions advisor, H ONE.
The best-in-class solution helps the Group avoid the hassles and hidden costs of tape backup and instead enables them to rely on Microsofts global network of cloud data centers to better protect critical business applications, speed recovery and restoration of services in the event of a site outage, and reduce data protection costs.
McLarens Group, which boasts a diversified holdings portfolio including hotels & leisure, property development and automotive products, is bullish about growth and opportunities, seeing the move to Azure as the next logical step forward for the business as they start rolling out several new joint ventures with leading enterprises. Commenting about the move, Joint Managing Director Shehara Jayawardana stated.
With potential comes risk, Group Head of ICT & Digital Business, Umeshi De Fonseka explains. We deal with demanding clients and time sensitive operations. If a system goes offline, we lose out on potential business opportunities. Every second counts. Soon after we started our move to Azure we learned that the competitor solution faced a four-hour outage. We cant afford that kind of downtime. he emphasized.Data security is another concern of ours, said de Fonseka.
Having evaluated on-premises options, the Group concluded that personnel, insurance, media and capex costs not only inflated maintenance operations, but also failed to afford the company the flexibility and scalability it required to divest or grow in line with the business.
To implement the Azure solution, McLarens Group turned to leading Microsoft Cloud Partner for South-East Asia New Markets, and Microsoft Partner of the Year for Sri Lanka - H ONE. Commenting on the cloud journey, H ONE CEO Samath Fernando said The Group began with their move of over 600 users to Microsoft Office 365 in 2016 which Im proud to say was executed in record time.

Mendis maiden century and Taskins hat-trick only bright sparks
DAMBULLA, Tuesday  A maiden One-Day International century from Kusal Mendis and a hat-trick from right-arm fast bowler Taskin Ahmed was the feature of the second one-day international between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh at the Rangiri Dambulla Stadium which ended in a no-result yesterday when rain washed out play during the innings break.
Dambulla expected to be a dry zone area experienced a rare occurrence of rain in late March soon as the Sri Lankan innings was terminated at 311, the last three wickets falling in a flurry to Taskin Ahmed who became the fifth Bangladesh bowler to perform the hat-trick in one-day international cricket.
Bangladesh never had a chance to commence their innings as it rained continuously forcing the umpires to abandon the match at 8.45 p.m.
Taskin had Asela Gunaratne caught by Soumya Sarkar at mid-off for 39 and followed it up with the wickets of Suranga Lakmal and Nuwan Pradeep off the next two deliveries to finish with figures of 4 for 47.
Before Taskin produced his magical spell in the final over of the innings Sri Lanka looked headed for a total in the range of 350 after winning the toss and batting first on a new pitch that had some grass and nice carry for the batters.
Sri Lanka captain Upul Tharanga playing in his 200th ODI set his team racing towards a substantial total when he hit a sparkling 65 off 76 balls with the aid of nine fours.
After losing his opening partner Danushka Gunathilaka for nine in the third over Tharanga joined by Mendis put together a century stand (111 off 133 balls) that laid the foundations for a big total.
Tharanga was in fine fettle playing some delightful cover drives that pierced the heavily guarded off side field and when a century was there for the taking he suffered what is now the buzz word in cricket circles  a brain fade and was run out needlessly.
Mahmudullah caught the Lankan captain napping with a smart piece of work to run him out off a no-ball. Tharanga strolled lazily for a single off a misfield by the wicket-keeper and found himself well short of the crease when Mahmudullah made a direct hit from short fine leg.
Mendis edgy at the beginning blossomed out gradually to play a delightful innings of 102 off 107 balls that contained a six and nine fours.
A few choicy words from the chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriya during practice put Mendis in the right frame of mind to make a contribution that was worthy of his talent.
Dinesh Chandimal, Gunaratne and Milinda Siriwardana all contributed with useful scores that set Sri Lanka racing towards the 350-run mark but successive run outs of Thisara Perera and Dilruwan Perera trying to sneak singles to wicket-keeper Mushfiqur Rahim who made direct hits to the wicket saw them falter.
Taskin ensured that Sri Lanka did not reach their intended target with a late spurt of fast-medium bowling that saw him join colleagues Shahadat Hossain v Zimbabwe (Harare) 2006, Abdur Razzak v Zimbabwe (Dhaka) 2010, Rubel Hossain v New Zealand (Dhaka) 2013 and Taijul Islam v Zimbabwe (Dhaka) 2014 who had performed the hat-trick for Bangladesh in ODIs before him.
Sri Lanka who are trailing 0-1 in the three match series rang in three changes to their side following Saturdays 90-run defeat with fast bowlers Nuwan Pradeep and Nuwan Kulasekara and off-spinner Dilruwan Perera replacing Lahiru Kumara, Lakshan Sandakan and Sachith Pathirana. Bangladesh remained unchanged.
The third and final ODI (a day game) will take place at the SSC grounds on April Fools Day (Saturday).

New Zealand rip out South Africas top order
Hamilton: Colin de Grandhomme fired with bat and ball to back up Kane Williamson's 176 as New Zealand tightened the screws on South Africa in the series deciding final Test in Hamilton on Tuesday.
At stumps on day four, South Africa were 80 for five in their second innings, still 95 runs short of making New Zealand bat again.
Faf du Plessis and Quinton de Kock were both 15 not out.
De Grandhomme, whose lower order 57 helped push New Zealand to 489, a lead of 175, struck in the sixth over of South Africa's reply with the wicket of Dean Elgar for five. He rounded off his day with a smart catch to dismiss Hashim Amla.
The Zimbabwe-born de Grandhomme was not required for the first Test when Elgar scored 140 and 89 but in four innings since he has removed the opener for scores of nine, 17, five and five.
The loss of Elgar should have signalled to South Africa it was time to dig in but instead wickets fell at regular intervals.
Theinus de Bruyn was run out for 12 in a bizarre mid-pitch collision after an Amla drive to mid off.
De Bruyn was keeping an eye on the fielder and veered into Amla, leaving the batsmen sprawled on the ground as Williamson threw to BJ Watling to complete the dismissal.
Amla, on eight then, progressed to 19 when he edged a ball from Jeetan Patel which rebounded off Watling's glove to the sole slip de Grandhomme.
Patel also bowled JP Duminy (13) and Matt Henry had Temba Bavuma caught behind for one to leave South Africa 59 for five before du Plessis and de Kock survived 12 overs to stumps.
Should New Zealand level the series it will be a remarkable turnaround from the eight-wicket, three-day hiding suffered in the second Test, and achieved without injured strike bowlers Trent Boult and Tim Southee as well as senior batsman Ross Taylor.
New Zealand started the day with a seven-run lead and added a further 168 with Williamson posting his third-highest Test score and de Grandhomme chipping in with his maiden half-century.
After Williamson and Mitchell Santner consolidated the innings with a patient 88-run stand for the fifth wicket, de Grandhomme finished the innings with a flourish, smacking five fours and two sixes in his 70-ball stay.
Williamson had looked assured throughout until he hooked Morkel to Vernon Philander at long leg after 449 minutes in the middle.
He faced 285 deliveries in the marathon innings which lasted more than seven hours and included 16 fours and three sixes.
When Santner went in the last over before lunch for 41, de Grandhomme joined BJ Watling to lift the pace.
From less than two an over the run rate lifted to four with Watling contributing 24 before he was bowled by Keshav Maharaj.
Henry added 12 and Patel five before the innings folded with de Grandhomme gloving a Morne Morkel flyer through to wicketkeeper de Kock.
Morkel took four for 100 and Kagiso Rabada four for 122 while de Kock held five catches behind the stumps. - AFP

Pakistan poised to become regional economic power
The 77th National Day of Pakistan was hosted by the High Commission of Pakistan in Sri Lanka on March 23, at Kingsbury Hotel in Colombo.
Public Enterprises Development Minister Kabir Hashim was the chief guest on the occasion.
The High Commissioner of Pakistan in Sri Lanka Maj. Gen. (R) Syed Shakeel Hussain said each year, on March 23, a yearning is reignited in the hearts of Pakistanis to nurture and uphold ideas and principles that enthused the Muslims of the Subcontinent to close their ranks in a remarkable act of unity becoming one entity to achieve their vision.
Shakeel Hussain highlighted that Pakistans economy is on the rise and is poised to become a regional economic power. China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project, manifestation of deepening bilateral relations between Pakistan and China will change the fate of the region in terms of socio-economic development. The mega project, once completed, will usher in prosperity and progress not only in Pakistan but also in the whole region including Sri Lanka, he underlined.
On Sri Lanka-Pakistan relations, he said that deep mutual love between our two peoples is the essential ingredient of this special relationship which is further cemented by the commonality of eternal values of universal peace and love espoused both by Islam and Buddhism. Hussain reiterated Pakistans continued commitment and support to the Government and people of Sri Lanka in their endeavours towards their march for achieving a bright and prosperous future of their beautiful country.
While speaking on the occasion, the Chief Guest Minister for Public Enterprises Development Hon. Kabir Hashim, said that Pakistan and Sri Lanka have always maintained close, cordial and mutually supportive relations which are broad-based and multifaceted. He thanked the government of Pakistan for providing most sacred Buddhas relics from Taxila for the veneration of Buddhists in Sri Lanka during the Vesak and Poson festivals. It was an honour for Sri Lanka to attend the first ever Vesak Festival in Pakistan from May 29 to 1st June 2016, he added.
Hon. Kabir Hashim expressed his gratitude for the support extended by Pakistan to the Government of Sri Lanka for grant of US$ 200 million credit facility, training to Sri Lankan armed forces, infrastructure development, relief assistance to flood and drought affected people, educational scholarships, training to Sri Lankan athletes, squash players and coaches etc. He expressed the confidence that Pakistan has been a true friend and the relations between the two countries will continue flourish for the betterment of our people.
During the event, a book titled Pakistan  Sri Lanka Relations: A Story of Friendship was also launched which is a joint publication as a sacred mission to bring both nations closer to each other by preserving the various pages from their modern history. The High Commissioner of Pakistan presented the first copy of the book to the chief guest.

Patali calls for amendment to university district quota system
Megapolis and Western Province Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka has asked that the 40-year-old district quota system for universities be amended instead of promoting SAITM as the solution for the problems caused by the district quota system.
The best solution to overcome the district quota system, he said would be to expand the existing government medical faculties and have a quota for fee levying students,
Those who have been disadvantaged through the district quota system can then get an education. If we open up at least 17 percent of the university for fee levying students, this could cover the capital expenditure of the expansion,the Minister said.
Minister Ranawaka was addressing a forum organised by the National Intellectual Council at the Mahaweli Centre yesterday.
Ranawaka also asked that SAITM be absorbed into the State University system or have its Medical Faculty taken in while letting it run its other courses independently.
SAITM was just a fore bringer of other private medical councils which the rulers of the previous regime wanted to open in Divulapitiya, Ratmalana and Suriyawewa. But history has shown us, with the example of the North Colombo Medical College that these dont work and that we cannot depend on legal solutions to solve the problem,he explained while observing that it was too risky to allow the private sector to handle medical education.
The Minister thus recommended that there be an immediate halt in the intake of new students into SAITM and to suspend its degree awarding status, We also know that almost 70 percent of SAITM students are qualified. To help them, the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) has the responsibility of arranging additional training and exams and allow them qualify as doctors. Those who are less qualified can be given the opportunity to be assistant medical officers. Those who fail, give them back their money and send them home, he added.
Ranawaka also believed that SAITM should not be allowed to function even if they were to implement the required minimum standards, given the manner in which they have acted, especially the recent actions of their own CEO, this is clearly a crooked enterprise, he said.
With regard to the district quota system, Ranawaka proposed that it be eventually amended to have 50 percent district quota and 50 percent merit. We also know that many students who come from the district quota find it hard to cope with requirements of the degree and often abandon it. We have to make the system based more on merit,he said. The issue of SAITM, Ranawaka explained has the potential to escalate beyond control and that it would lead to social unrest similar to that of the 70s and 80s.
We call on the parents to look into the actions of their children, because what started as a protest in the 80s over the North Colombo Medical College became a bloody revolution. Those political parties who arouse such protests do not want to solve the issue, they simply want to recruit more party cadres. We cannot let our children be sacrificed again, said the minister and added that while there were a few vocal ministers in support of SAITM within Cabinet, there was also a silent majority who have understood the brevity of the situation.
Medical faculties cannot be created on a whim, you need the right urban, middle class and educated to establish them. The ones in Galle, Peradeniya, Kelaniya, Jaywardenapura and Colombo have established well while in Anuradhapura it is failing. If they are to open more, the Western Province and Kurunegala are good places,he said.

This is the most prestigious award in the automotive industry as it is judged by a panel of 58 impartial, veteran motoring journalists from a multitude of countries" added Amerasinghe, he added.
The new Peugeot 3008 was named the 2017 Car of the Year (COTY) on March 6 in Geneva by a judging panel comprising 58 European journalists.

Queen Anula - The shadow of Cleopatra
In the new criticism , the moment where the characters achieve realization, awareness or a feeling of knowledge after which events are seen through the prism of light in the story is called epiphany. Mohan Raj Madawala uses the so called insight lavishly throughout his novel Rajina.
Queen Anula who reigned the country in 47BC is described as a murderous and lecherous queen who sought lustful companionship of a number of husbands. In any national historical legends that kind of branded vendetta can be observed. But most probably a sincere account of as to how such incidents occurred might not have been recorded. In reflecting this type of controversial issues availability of a penetrating vision on the part of an author plays an important role.
It is essential to perceive the traditional history in an anthropological view and on the other hand with a humanitarian vision . This concept, in criticism, is identified as New Historicism. Mohan Rajs Rajina , when looking at that perspective , could be categorized as a novel written in the light of New Historicism.
Prof. Vimal Dissanayake, distinguishing the New and Old History from New Historicism states that the Old History is based on chronicles and literature whereas the the New Historicism deals with the contemporary and also circumstantial documents as well. Mohan too seems not to have kept an absolute trust solely on the chronicles, but it is obvious that he has referred to the other contemporary historical documents as well as the history of Egypt and Cleopatra. It is a significant approach in creation of historical fictions
The name Anula, the queen, though considered as a nymphomaniac character by the common people, one might feel, when reading the novel Rajina that she is a very sensitve woman of humanitarian qualities blended with sensuality. It is according to the common practice of attributing the final responsibility of any diplomatic issue upon the ruler, that the queen Anula has been recorded in the history as a murderous and a Jezebel.
Each of Anulas husbands died as a result of insidious conspiracies in the state. Those who instigated such conspiracies were the representatives of various social forces of the time. But just because of the fact that it was Anulas husbands who were murdered, the blame easily fell on her.
According to Meda Midula by Senarathna Weerasinghe, a translation of George Bernard Shaws Days with Bernard Shaw (1949) it is evident that promoting or tarnishing an image of either of a historical or contemporary person occur based on social requirements. This reality seemingly has an impact on creating an unfavorable image on Anulas character.
Its true that Anula had to be the wife of many men. Her first husband was the King Mahanaga. Later on she was compelled to be the wife of someone else who uses her only to quench the thirst for lust. But Anula developed an attachment which would harmonize with internal sexual and emotional rhythm of each other.
It was a carter by the name of Thissa who subsequently became a minister of her court and later on the one and only love of her life. In D.H.Lawrences Fantasia of Unconcious this reality is described. According to Lawrence there is a tendency for those with equal sexual and emotional (mental) to amalgamate.
These relationships occur irrespective of the accepted religious, cultural or ethical values. It is not difficult for lay immature, ignorant people to come to conclusions about the lives of others. Thus the heresy about certain people would become popular topics for daily gossip. But actually speaking it is only by a mature sensible person with a broad understanding of humanity and knowledge of subtle epistemological nature, who could pass down to earth judgement over such issues. Dr. Philip C. Margo in his Life Strategies states that it is better to maintain silence on the part of those incapable, rather than voice their opinion on intricate and sensitive problems of people.
Mohan Raj Madawalas Rajina can be identifies as an attempt to cast epiphany in connection with the sensitive character of queen Anula, demolishing all the dark patches attributed to her by the people who are immature and of little education.

The car combines unbeatable best-in-class maintenance part costs, which reinforces the decision making process.

Schoolchildren have responsibility to win the next century  President
President Maithripala Sirisena said school children have the responsibility of winning the next century by building on past experiences.
Addressing the centenary celebration of Ferguson High School, Ratnapura, on Monday, where he was the chief guest, the President said, As evident, the history of a country is the foundation for what would happen in that country in the future. In this current era when everything depends on money, we should understand the challenge to win not only exams but also life, he pointed out.
The school children in Sri Lanka excel in passing exams, but we cannot be satisfied with their discipline, he said, citing several recent examples.
A souvenir stamp was issued to mark the 100th anniversary of the school. The President presented gifts to the students who demonstrated outstanding skills. He declared open the newly built indoor stadium of the school and visited the stalls of the exhibition, organized to mark the anniversary.
President Sirisena presented a plant to the Principal of the school, M. Galagama, symbolizing of the project to plant 4,000 trees, under the programme of Sustainable Schools.
He also presented a notice which was made by the Environment Ministry.
The notice which has been designed to raise awareness about the environmental protection will be exhibited at every school. Two students of the school presented an environmental-friendly bag to the President.
This bag has been produced by the Ferguson High School. The Principal of the school presented a souvenir to the President at this occasion.
Ministers Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, W. D. J. Senevirathne, Deputy Minister Dunesh Gankanda, Governor Marshal Perera and the Chief Minister of Sabaragamuwa Province Maheepala Herath were among those participated in this ceremony.

She stepped in where Angels feared to tread
Women today have progressed in a variety of fields and reached the pinnacle of achievement but yet when a girl informs her parents or elders that she would be travelling out of town, or even stepping out of the confines of her home, the first question everyone in Sri Lanka asks is Who are you going with Will you be safe Are you not scared The premise is that girls are not safe going out on their own and this is the question that Devika Casiechetty set to answer when she decides to walk around Sri Lanka alone. Her mission is, A Girl on a Solo quest.
Casiechettys idea was simple as it was to walk around Sri Lanka on her own to prove that Sri Lanka is the safest place to walk around solo as a woman but with the course of time, her initial plan begin to change.
I have now decided to not only explore whether Sri Lanka is safe to walk alone as a woman but also to ascertain whether it is unsafe and how we could make it safer for women, she said.
Hailing from Panadura, Modhara, Casiechetty said it was a huge challenge for her at the age of 38 to come to this decision even though she had always been interested in outdoor activities. While working for Uga escape in Yala as the Assistant Front Officer, she embarked on her first adventure with a hike to Kirigalpotha in 2011.
Before I went there, I was told that there would be nine guys and two girls including me. But, when I went there, the organizer informed me that the other girl had backed off and I was the only one. I was not scared, but felt excited to join a team with only guys. However, I felt very comfortable and it was real fun, she said.
Since then, she had trekked over 10 mountains. The solo trip according to her, was inspired by the movie Tracks in which an Australian woman undertakes a solo trip across the desert.
According to the movie, that woman did the solo trip in 1979. So I thought, why cannot a Sri Lankan woman do the same A few men had done solo trips before, but I have not heard of any woman doing so, she said.
She said that many people encouraged her to go on the trip, while some kept silant.
I have been trying to get a sponsor since 2015, but I was still unable to find one. I started my adventure in January this year, while spending all my savings on it. After trying so hard to find a sponsor, I simply abandoned the idea of wasting my time and began my journey using my savings, she said.
Prior to the quest this year, she had chosen to walk from Pettah to Warakapola with Asela who was one of her friends last year. They had walked 60 KM overnight in 22 hours.
This walk gave me insight. I saw it as an opportunity that made me realize my physical and mental strength, she said.
The walk
Casiechettys original plan was to walk around the country, a total of 1,268 KM in 55 days, but she was unable to do so as her mother fell ill.
I had to take care of my mother so I could not be away from home continuously for 55 days. Therefore I decided to cut down my plan in to several sections and do it one at a time, letting another Sri Lankan girl get the chance of doing the solo walk in 55 days, she said.
Casiechetty started her adventure on January 10, 2017 from Kirivehara to Kataragama.
The 1st phase was 10 - 14 January from Kataragama to Dikwella, the 2nd phase was from January 20 - 24 from Dikwella to Magonna, 3rd phase from January 29 to February 01 from Magonna to Madampe, 4th and 5th phases were on February 06 -15 from Madambe to Eluwankulama and Thalaimannar to Point Pedro, 6th phase from March 07 -09 from Daluwa to Kalpitiya and Marichchikadduwa to Mannar and the 7th phase would be in the first week of April from Point Pedro to Panama through the coastal road, she explained.
She said she would conclude her quest after walking through Yala during the Pada Yatra season.
After finishing the coastal road, I would have to wait for another two months to complete my quest, she said.
She has uploaded a GPS Tracking application that showed the places she had travelled, the speed and the time taken to keep track of her walk.
Cassiechetty said she had no option, but to trust Google Maps along her journey as she barely knew the route in many areas.
While I was walking towards Hambantota from Tangalle, the app showed it to be just 25 KM. It was only after I walked 15 KM that I realized that the road had been closed after new development projects. The app had not been updated, therefore I had to walk 5 KM to the town and walked another 15 KM around the Port. My initial plan to walk 25 KM ended up by me walking 36 KM! It was very challenging, but I am happy that I was able to do it, she said.
Overcoming internal challenges
All this would not have become a reality if she was not able to convince her parents to go along with her plan. As she recalled, the first time she informed her parents of her idea, she said they immediately panicked and refused to permit her to do so.
My parents did not like my plan at all, but I slowly convinced them. They later believed in me and let me take my decisions on my own. But, until I was 22 years, I was an introvert. I had social phobia and hardly moved with people, she said.
She further said that after 6 PM her father would not let her out alone, while she had only a very few friends to count on.
My father was in the hospitality field. So I also started my career in hospitality management. After my A/Ls, I worked as an accountants clerk and later joined the Hilton in Colombo. I have a feeling that it is that job and the field that fully changed my life. I began to learn new languages and most importantly, got over my fear of speaking to people. After that, I received a chance to go to Dubai and worked there for six years. In 2011, I returned to Sri Lanka, she said.
Having returned home from her stint in Dubai, she said her thoughts surprisingly shifted to her becoming a nun.
I do not know what exactly made me have thoughts of becoming a nun, but I badly wanted to do so. As my mother did not like it and strongly opposed it, I had to drop the idea of becoming a nun. However, after I joined Amran and their team to go hiking, things began to change, she said.
When she first mentioned to her friends her idea and the tag line A girl on a solo quest, they however, did not first believe that she would truly go for it.
Some of my friends teased me and said that I should call it an Aunty on a solo quest. But I preferred to call it girl. But, I want young girls to take this as an example to try challenging activities. However, I see more girls taking an interest in hiking and trekking these days. I have met many girls who love to do something adventurous. There are also girls who do not take part in such activities as their families do not want them to do something that would not be safe, she said.
Social expectations
Casiechetty said that some also have a feeling that women are not physically strong enough to do such activities, which was not true.
In foreign countries even a 16-year-old girl could go around the country alone. I think that many girls are coming on board to experience the adventurous life. I have a feeling that Sri Lankan girls and women are more independent when compared to other South Asian countries, but I know there are exceptional situations, she said.
She emphasized that men should respect women for thei6r strength as well as their weakness.
Girls also should seize the opportunities that come their way. Without missing such opportunities available, how could someone blame society Many people stereotype the role of women. They are not open minded people. Any decision that you take in your life has risks. If the roads are not safe for girls at night, we should find ways and means to overcome them. Where ever you go, you would come across psychopaths which is unavoidable. To overcome such situations, girls could learn martial arts. It might take some time but we can do it as society would change eventually, she said.
Having hiked throughout Sri Lanka for the past several months, Cassiechetty said in many ways, her faith in humanity had increased as she stopped by Sinhala Buddhist, Christian, Tamils and Muslim houses when she needed assistance of any kind.
After Puttalam, it was all Muslim and Tamil villages. I did not know Tamil and they did not know Sinhala or English. There was a huge language gap between us, but we were able to communicated with each other. We used sign language to express ourselves which was very effective,she said.
She added that she would start learning Tamil once she finished her journey.
When I went to Puttalam, I sought the help of the Mahanayaka Thero to look for a place to spend the night. Something very interesting happened then.
He introduced me to the Moulawi of that village who willingly offered me one the rooms in his house. His whole family was very nice to me. When you mingle with people, you discover how awesome they are irrespective of the culture and the religion they follow, she said.
Speaking further of her experiences, she recalled another character; a girl whom she met in Waduwa,
I met a girl who had lost both her legs as a result of a land mine. She was wearing plastic legs. When I was passing a village she came over to speak to me. She told me that she did notice me walking but was reluctant to talk at first, but had finally decided to talk to me.We did not understand each others language, but said I could read her mind, said Casiechetty.
My heart skipped for a moment when the girl told me that she wished she had legs so that she too could have joined me. She wrote in one of my note books I like you but I feel that she had more to say, she said.
People more than the road she walked on, have left a clear mark on Casiechettys life. All those whom I met along the way had beautiful souls, she said.
We live in a circle and we tend to judge the people whom we have never met or seen in our lives. Take a walk around and you will discover many more beautiful souls in your lives too, she added.
This is just the beginning for Casiechetty. Her next adventure seeks to be more ambitious and daring than those before. She plans on embarking on the Pacific trail next and there too she would be the first Sri Lankan woman to have done so.

SLFP May Day rally at Getambe
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party would hold its May Day Rally at Gatambe in Kandy by demonstrating its strength despite attempts to divide it by several groups Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody said.
He made this observation yesterday at a press conference held at the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry auditorium.
He also said that the Joint Opposition that attempted to divide the party is becoming weaker.
The failure of the JO was reflected at the Habaraduwa rally that was held recently, Minister Weerakkody said.
There was only 5000 to 6000 thousand people. The rally could not attract even 10 percent of the SLFPers in Habaraduwa. It is a pathetic situation and its failure affects both the JO and SLFP. He also said that they expect more and more rallies be organized by JO on monthly basis so that the fall of the JO could be visible clearly.
He also said that it was questionable if the JO had any pact with some other parties to divide the SLFP.
During the rally, the JO criticized only the SLFP and not the UNP. On the other hand the UNP also had not criticized the JO rally in Habaraduwa, Minister Weerakkody said however the UNP too would be pleased to see the SLFP being divided .
He also said that the people expect the SLFP and JO to join together and work for the country.

SLFP National Youth Convention on April 2
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) National Youth Convention will be held on a grand scale at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium on April 2 after a lapse of 13 years under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, the SLFP Youth Front Chairman Shantha Bandara said the convention will aim to resolve the 10 major issues faced by the youth.
We conducted an island-wide research and identified main problems faced by the youth in Sri Lanka for last two years. Most of these issues will be resolved on April 2. The SLFP Youth Front has been at the forefront in giving guidance for the future of the youth and resolving their problems, the Chairman said.
We do not need youth insurgences. Many young lives were destroyed in the 77, 88 and 89 insurgencies and also in the northern war. Who is responsible for those deaths Has the country benefited from them and the destructions, he queried.
Students will be enrolled through interviews on April 8 to the the Political Science College, which will be started soon.
Young people in the age group of 18 and 35 can enrol in the college without any political bias, he said.
Commenting on the media reports on insufficient security for the Commissioners appointed to probe bond issue, he said that the President should take measures to provide adequate security to the Commissioners probing the bond issue.
He said the Commissioners should be allowed to hold an inquiry impartially without any interferences. We will soon be able to know who robbed the poor peoples money, he said.

In Sri Lankas deep waters marine conservation goes hi-tech

As the midday sun rises higher over Gulf of Mannar, a drone hovers over the blue mass of sea water. Below, a motley crowd of fishermen gathers, straining their eyes at a drone.
A few metres from the crowd, conservationist Prasanna Weerakkody operating the drone raises it to 500 metres, before moving it slowly in different directions, allowing the device to film a large swathe of water.
One day, he believes, the roving camera of this drone will send images of one of the most elusive sea mammals in this ocean: the dugong.
Dugong usually swims at a depth of about 5-10 metres. Being mammals, they also come above water every few minutes to inhale fresh air. The drone has the capacity of rising one km high, but we usually operate it at 400-500 metres. This is enough to capture images of dugong, says Weerakkody, whose organisation  Ocean Resources Conservation Association (ORCA)  is a partner of the four-year Global Environment Facility (GEF) funded, multi-agency environmental initiative: theDugong and Sea Grass Conservation Project.
Saving the Oceans Most Vulnerable
The dugong  a manatee-like creature known locally as sea pig  is listed as vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which is also a partner in the conservation project.
The worlds only vegetarian sea mammal, the dugong lives at a depth of 5-15 meters, feeding on sea grass. Its natural habitat is vast  stretching from Eritrea in East Africa to Vanuatu in the Pacific. However, there is no documented information on their numbers in Sri Lankan waters. Very little is also known about their behaviour and movement, such as when and how they move, which part of the sea or grass bed they frequent and why, and which seasons are the most favourable. In short, most questions that one can raise about a dugong here are unanswered.
The main reason, says Arjan Rajasurya, Project Manager at IUCN Sri Lanka, is that the dugong is a very secretive animal which rarely shows up. There may be a dugong right under a boat, but you will not know of its existence because it does not jump through the water like a dolphin or squirt water like a whale, he explains.
The secretiveness is proven by the fact that none of the officials involved in the multi-agency conservation project has ever seen a live dugong.
And yet as many as 13 dugongs are known to have been killed in the past three years, many of them reported by the local media. Sri Lankas National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA)  a marine research organisation  has also carried out autopsies on some dead dugong.
Locals  especially fishermen whose gill nets catch and kill dugongs  are also tight-lipped and seldom come forward to share information on the sea mammal, probably fearing punitive actions by the government or backlash from other fishermen.
Besides gathering missing information on the mammal and its habitat and chalk out a strategy to protect both, the 4.88 million dollar Dugong Conservation project, which took off in mid-2015, also aims to curb illegal fishing and bridge the communication and awareness gap with the locals. To help achieve this, use of a drone was decided as a crucial component, say the project partners.
Killer War Tool as Marine life Protector
Technically, a drone is an unmanned aircraft with powerful cameras that capture images below. It can be either remotely controlled or fly on its own using software such as onboard sensors and GPS. Extensively used by security forces in war zones, the drone has lately gained a reputation as a dangerous killer machine that drops bombs on people  terrorists and civilians alike.
The most extensive  and controversial  use of drones has been in Pakistan and in the Middle East where the war against terror has been raging for years.
However, here in the deep waters of Sri Lanka, the technology is a last-mile effort to save critically endangered marine animals by monitoring their movement, studying their habitat and preventing their capture and killing by illegal fishers.
According to Weerakkody, who leads a dedicated team of marine life experts, this is probably the first time ever that drone technology is being used for marine conservation. This is a Phantom basic pro robotic machine fitted with a camera that can shoot over 2 K video, which is almost three times as clear as the picture on your HD TV..
Apart from the drone, the ORCA team is using a side-scan sonar device that captures echoes from an object on the sea floor and creates its images after measuring the strength of how loud the return echo is.
However, this device can only work if it is placed on a moving object  such as a boat or an underwater vehicle  which produces a sound. So, if a dugong is right next to the sonar, but the solar carrier is still, the device will not be able to capture its image. Also, given that the dugong is a shy and secretive animal, it will most likely swim away when it senses a moving vehicle nearby.
An Everymans Mobile App
While the drone and the side-scan sonar are handled by highly skilled experts like Weerakkody, the project is also designing technologies that are user-friendly and can be used by community members with little or no training.
Channa Suraweera, Project Manager at Sri LankasDepartment of Wildlife Conservation, demonstrated one such design to IDN: an application that can be used by locals to report sighting of a dugong or any other large sea animal.
Based on Smart Survey software, the app gives multiple options for a user to report what has been seen: a dugong, a dolphin, a whale or any other sea animal. In a few seconds, with a few clicks, someone can send a text and a photograph which will be stored at a government-run server. The department will analyse this information and add this is to a database on sea mammals which is currently being built.
As of now, we have very little data on dugong and we cannot build an entire database on our own. So we built this app to involve the general public in collecting information and sharing it with us, said Suraweera.Its very easy to use and any mobile phone user with an internet connection can provide us with data. Once we have enough data, we can create a concrete plan to protect the dugong. We can also use the data to popularise tourism in the country, especially in the southern part of the ocean where whales are seen.
Promoting Digital Communication
Suraweera explained that he mobile app is actually a part of a larger plan to build a fully computerised marine conservation coordination centre given the current communication gap among various government agencies, locals and civil society organisations on the issue of sea mammal conservation.
Once established, the centre will help loop in each of these agencies  including the Sri Lankan Navy and Coast Guard  and providing training in the latest digital technologies developed by the department. It will be a centre that will strengthen communication and also help create a robust digitised database on marine conservation, Suraweera predicted.
High End Technology for a Biodiverse Future
Mekala Christopher is a young boatman in Kalpitiya who often ferries officials and tourists to the high sea to see corals and dolphins. On several occasions, Christopher has seen a drone in the sky, but he says he has no idea what it is actually for and that he is also unaware of the massive conservation initiative to protect sea mammals such as the dugong.
According to Suraweera, if this conservation project is to succeed, members of the local community like Christopher must have a way to extend their support to it. This project can only create guidelines and a framework for action, but the real action can be taken only by locals. They need to take part in the information sharing system, he says, pointing at the fishermens village on the shore.
Veerakkody, on the other hand, hopes that the future will see deployment of more drones with more sophisticated features. The accomplishments of the drone in the projects first year have been satisfactory: images have revealed that the sea grass bed is largely fine, except for some sporadic damage caused by fishing trawlers. But a higher end drone with more advanced technology such as a 4k camera could help better monitor their movement and map the habitat. Those devices could decide the course of tomorrows conservation, he says confidently.

Sri Lanka Unites to fete eminent  persons on 10th anniversary
Sri Lanka Unites is a movement started by Prashan De Visser as he took the opportunity to replace a culture of divisiveness and conflict and be a voice for change, hope and reconciliation.
As the name suggests, SLU's vision was to unite the youth of all ethnic and religious groups across Sri Lanka, creating a peaceful and prosperous nation for future generations.
As the civil war drew to a close, the initiators of Sri Lanka Unites (SLU) recognized the need for reconciliation amongst the younger generation in order to ensure that the wounds of prejudice do not deem the country to be divided for years to come.
The movement began with a small team of volunteers but 10 years on, due to its growth and impact, SLU now has small team of full-time employees who work alongside to oversee projects throughout all 25 districts.
SLU describes the heart of their movement as the SLU clubs in schools throughout all districts, which now has 20,000 members of different gender, race, and religion, all working towards one goal; a united Sri Lanka.
Through events such as the Future Leaders conference, which brings together the top student leaders from around the country for 5 days, SLU catalyses the process of integration and reconciliation. The conference enables student leaders to meet their peers from various parts of the island and provide the students the opportunity to challenge the prejudices that they may have inherited, empowering them to be agents of change and be a part of the solution.
The recently established reconciliation centres in Mullathivu, Kalmunai, Matara and Moneragala aim to provide education to youth in these districts through Information Technology, language skills and entrepreneurial education skills.
Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama receiving a memento.
Providing counseling and career guidance, many of the graduate from these educational hubs go on to pursue higher education, creating employment opportunities, making them more employable and a symbol of hope and reconciliation in their own regions.
While celebrating their 10th anniversary, SLU will be recognizing the pioneers of who forged a path for reconciliation and peace in our beautiful nation.The 10th anniversary celebrations will include the acknowledgement of 8 key individuals who have made significant contributions to the cause of peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka by the awarding of the 'Outstanding Sri Lankan Role Model".
Among the 8 recipients of the award is Visaka Dharmadasa, Chair and founder of the Association of War Affected Women, Dr Jayantha Dhanapala, Former UN under secretary general for Disarmament, Kushil Gunasekara, founder of the Foundation of Goodness and Dr Selvy Thiruchandran Trustee and Board Member of the Women's Education and Research Centre (WERC).

## Title: Sriyani Amarasena: The Fragile Female

Sriyani Amarasena: The Fragile Female
Unlike the early Swarna Mallawarachchi and Veena Jayakody and the later Irangani Serasinghe, theres little (if at all) which distinguishes the first few phases of Sriyani Amarasenas career from her subsequent ones. I cant come up with a proper description of the characters that she played, but I believe Lester James Peries came closest to it: that most of the characters she depicted reflected her doll-like, fragile, empathetic figure and voice. This is not an assessment as such of Sriyanis career or life, rather a cursory sketch of how she figured in an era where the female in our cinema gained more representation and agency.
She was born Sriyani Weerakoon Kumarihamy in Meethotamulla to a fairly middle-class family. In her own words (I talked with her two years ago) she had a very secure and privileged childhood, largely protected by the income her father received from his job at the Colombo Municipal Council. Added to this was the fact that she was an only child, which meant that her education was received in comparatively good schools: firstly at Meethotamulla Vidyalaya, then at Museaus College and later at Gothami Balika Vidyalaya, the latter two in Colombo. She completed her studies until her SSC, during which time she also indulged in singing, acting, dancing, and drawing.
When I put to her that most girls her age, at that time, would have been discourage from pursuing the arts by their parents, Sriyani begged to differ and replied, Not my parents. From Day One, they knew what I was good at. Far from discouraging me, they actually took me to Siri Perera in the SLBC and put me in his Lama Mandapaya program. She was, she told me, about seven or eight at the time, young enough to nurture her talent at singing and acting so that in her teenage and adult years, she was aspiring for real performances. She got those through her first real figure of destiny, Dayananda Gunawardena.
Apparently her mother had answered a paper advertisement calling for a teenage girl for a stage drama called Thammanna. The role had been that of Kuveni. Because she was only 15 at the time, the director had turned down her application. Around the same time, however, Dayananda had seen her and had taken her in for his Nari Bana. She was the Gama Duwa, the girl who enraptures a wolf which kidnaps her to be its consort. While I have not seen Sriyani in Nari Bana I have seen subsequent versions of Dayanandas play, enough for me to surmise that Sriyani symbolised the pliable woman shed end up playing in the cinema.
In the late sixties, after her marriage to journalist and writer Arthur Amarasena, she was called in to act in Lester James Peries Delovak Athara by Tissa Abeysekara. Because she was pregnant at the time, though, she (and the other actress tipped to play the female protagonist in it, Anula Karunatilake), were not taken in. Anula would be featured in Lesters next film, Ran Salu, while Sriyani got to play the sister-in-law to Wickrema Bogoda in his very next film, Golu Hadawatha.
As Champa, the almost motherly figure to Sugath (Bogoda), Sriyani occupied no more than 10 or 15 minutes in the story. She comes across as a perfect yet subtle counterpoint to Sugaths lover, Dhammi. If Dhammi represents a talkative, freewheeling spirit, Champa represents stability, motherliness, protectiveness, and tradition. Her character is manipulated to appear rather too accommodating of Sugaths shifts of temper and anger, but in the second half of the story, Sugath is made aware of how similar to such an accommodative character even Dhammi is, so much so that she compels him gently to return to his brother (Wijeratne Warakagoda) and Champa.
The roles that Sriyani got to play after Golu Hadawatha (especially as protagonists) were static and refreshingly so, to say the least. Despite the differences in time and place, theres nothing much that separates Sundari in Desa Nisa from Vineetha in Ahasin Polawata (both of which were directed by Lester James Peries). The only difference is that in the former, we come across the Sriyani who compels men to take to her because of her compassion, only to be disconcerted once that veneer of empathy withers away. This is of particular interest to me, so I will explain it further.
In the final sequence in Desa Nisa (which was for some reason rather crassly cut), when Sundari is cured by the insidious hermit (Ravindra Randeniya), she finally comes across Nirudaka and understands why he was so unwilling to get her cured (because he is ugly). For a moment, both Nirudaka and his mother (Denawaka Hamine) are happy but on tenterhooks, expecting her reaction to his ugliness. When she does finally react, with a laugh that is at once sharp and ambiguous (does she laugh because she scoffs Nirudakas worries or because she dislikes his face), Nirudaka retires to the forest, defeated. That laugh, and that ambiguous reaction, brings up my point that because Sriyani was so driven by empathy, the moment she let her instincts take over her essential character, she jolted every man and woman beside her.
That is why she induces our unconditional compassion as Vineetha in Ahasin Polawata. That is also why, paired as she was with the tempestuous Tony Ranasinghe (who by then had entered his second career phase, depicting cruel and morally ambiguous men), she was completely herself there, a point Lester implied in a conversation I had with him some years ago. As Regi Siriwardena noted in his review of the film (which he did not like), however, there is absolutely nothing that rationalises Tonys dislike of his wife, save his irrational impulses, which in a way weakens the plot and which cant be salvaged even by an able supporting cast (Vijaya Kumaratunga, Ajith Jinadasa, Vasanthi Chathurani, D. R. Nanayakkara, and Shanti Lekha). In the end, Ahasin Polawata deteriorates into the same kind of maudlin sentimentality its director (Lester) had wanted to avoid.
On this count, it was Sriyanis character which substantiated those irrational impulses which Tonys character spouts. Tony is jealous, spiteful, and envious: he is driven by reason, not emotion, so much so that he refuses to deliver his own child. By her genuinely felt reactions to his flare-ups, she helps us the audience parse the plot (which was dependent on flashbacks, reawakening Tonys guilt at her death). The final sequence does not, to my mind, come together well (Vineethas sister Pushpa, played by Vasanthi, extends a hand to Tony, symbolising reconciliation), but the sequence before it, of Sriyani reflecting optimistically on her marriage, serves as a more coherent finale.
I have written a lot on Ahasin Polawata because for me, Sriyani came out best in that remarkable though flawed film. The films she got thereafter  barring a few against type performances in Sarungale (where was a hardy, chatty, and gossipy shanty woman) and a few other commercial flicks  accentuated the image of her as a fragile but determined woman, which put her opposite the likes of Swarna Mallawarachchi, Nadeeka Gunasekara, and Anoja Weerasinghe.
In the final analysis, with all those films and serials she got to act in, produce, and even direct, she merely reminded us that with that slender, graceful figure and voice of hers, she could portray women who neither crooned at nor rebelled against their cruel destinies, but rather opted to move along with the flow, retaining optimism in a world that was increasingly being occupied by cruel husbands, fathers, and lovers. It is from this point that I can conclude by writing that inasmuch as the agency of the female could be portrayed by depicting them as fighters and independent thinkers, Sriyani proved that even as a slender, fragile, and deeply thoughtful woman, she could just as ably reinforce that same agency.

Theresa May signs letter that will trigger Brexit

Theresa May has signed the letter that will formally begin the UK's departure from the European Union.
Giving official notice under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, it will be delivered to European Council president Donald Tusk later.
In a statement in the Commons, the prime minister will then tell MPs this marks "the moment for the country to come together".
It follows June's referendum which resulted in a vote to leave the EU.
May's letter will be delivered at 12:30 BST on Wednesday by the British ambassador to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow.
The prime minister, who will chair a cabinet meeting in the morning, will then make a statement to MPs confirming the countdown to the UK's departure from the EU is under way.
She will promise to "represent every person in the whole United Kingdom" during the negotiations - including EU nationals, whose status after Brexit has yet to be settled.
"It is my fierce determination to get the right deal for every single person in this country," she will say.
"For, as we face the opportunities ahead of us on this momentous journey, our shared values, interests and ambitions can - and must - bring us together."
Key events and possible timings
29 March, 2017- UK triggers Article 50
29 April- EU summit of the 27 leaders (without the UK) to agree to give the European Commission a mandate to negotiate with the UK
May- European Commission to publish negotiating guidelines based on the mandate the EU leaders give it. The EU might say something about possible parallel negotiation on a future EU-UK trade deal
May/June 2017- Negotiations begin

Between October 2018 and March 2019- The Houses of Parliament, European Council and European Parliament vote on any deal
March 2019- UK formally withdraws from the European Union (The Article 50 negotiations could be extended, but this is subject to the approval of the other 27 EU member states)
Attempting to move on from the divisions of June's referendum, May will add: "We are one great union of people and nations with a proud history and a bright future.
"And, now that the decision has been made to leave the EU, it is time to come together."
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party respected the decision to leave the EU and would hold the government to account "every step of the way".
He said: "Britain is going to change as a result. The question is how."
Corbyn warned it would be "a national failure of historic proportions" if May does not secure protection for workers' rights.

Tissa Attanayake seeks Court's permission to travel abroad

Former UNP General Secretary Tissa Attanayake sought Courts permission today to travel abroad.
His request will be considered on April 3 by the Colombo High Court.
 Filing a motion before High Court Judge Wikum Kaluarachchi, Tissa Attanayake requested to be allowed to travel to Australia to visit his daughter.
 Tissa Attanayakes passport was impounded by Court for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media during the last Presidential Election for the purpose of afflicting the result of then Common Candidate, Maithripala Sirisena.
 Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama informed Court that the Attorney General's opinion regarding this request will be informed at the next hearing.
Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa appeared on behalf of the accused.
 On October 19 last year, Tissa Attanayake was ordered to be remanded till December 5 for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media during the last Presidential Election by inciting racial or religious hatred among ethnic communities.
Attanayake is currently out on bail.
 The accused was charged under Section 3(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 of 2007. This is the first time in Sri Lanka an accused was indicted in the High Court by the Attorney General over an offence that comes under the ICCPR Act.
The Attorney General alleged that Tissa Attanayakehad publicly announced on December 22, 2014 that there was a secret agreement between the then Common Opposition Candidate Maithripala Sirisena and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.
 The Attorney General alleged Tissa Attanayake to have committed an offence under Section 3(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 of 2007 by inciting racial or religious hatred among ethnic communities.
 Section 3(1) of the ICCPR cites that no person shall propagate war or advocate national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to cause discrimination, hostility or violence.
 The AG further alleged that Tissa Attanayake has committed a punishable offence under Sections 454 and 459 of the Penal Code by forging a document and displaying it to the public as genuine and that the accused has also committed an offence under Section 80-C of the Presidential Election Act for displaying a fake document prior to an election, for the purpose of affecting the result of that election in relation to the personal character or conduct of any candidate.
 The AG has listed 15 persons including President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as witnesses in the case.

Touring ECB Bunbury XI loses opening match
The ECB Bunbury XI started their short tour of Sri Lanka with a six-wicket defeat at the hands of Sri Lanka Under 16 development squad at the Colts grounds.
Having elected to bat first the tourists found themselves under pressure through some excellent new ball bowling from Niduka Malshith and Ashan Dilhara (man of the match).
From 19 for 5 it took good application from the tourists to reach 134 with Hamidullah Quadri (Derbyshire) and Sean Sullivan (Essex) showing the way.
The tourists needed to be at their best with the ball to apply any pressure, and if a straightforward chance had been accepted at 55 for 3 it could have created some nervousness in the home dressing room.
This was not to be, and mature batting from Shamaaz and Umayanga guided the hosts to a comfortable and well deserved six-wicket victory.
The tourists, given this was their first outdoor experience for several months, will now know what is required to play against a well prepared opposition in challenging conditions.
This tour has been arranged to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Bunbury Festival, which since its foundation in 1986 by David English CBE, has brought together the best Under-15 cricketers in England and Wales.
The tourist are due to play three more 50-over matches at Colts, Surrey Village and Galle.
Scores:
ECB Bunbury 134 in 45.1 overs (Hami Quadri 37, Sean Sullivan 35, Malshith 2/15, Dilhara 2/24, Tharindu 2/19)
Sri Lanka U16 Development 136-4 in 31.2 overs (Perera 21, Mishara 24, Shamaaz 22 n.o., Umayanga 31 n.o.)

US vows to end Israel-bashing at UN
US: The US ambassador to the United Nations received a rapturous welcome Monday at Washingtons biggest pro-Israel forum, where she vowed never to allow Israel-bashing at the world body.
Nikki Haley was addressing the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) policy conference for the first time since President Donald Trump named her Washingtons UN envoy.
And she drew a clear line under the record of her predecessor, who in December abstained from a UN Security Council vote, thus allowing a resolution criticizing Israeli settlements to pass.
Haley described Resolution 2334 as a kick in the gut to all Americans, and warned other UN members that the United States would retaliate against any new attempt to isolate Israel.
Basically what it comes down to is that Im not there to play, and what I wanted to make sure of was that the United States started leading again, she told the lobby groups invitees. Never do we not have the backs of our friends. We dont have a greater friend than Israel, she added. And to see that happen was not only embarrassing it was hurtful. What I can tell you is that everybody at the United Nations is scared to talk to me about Resolution 2334, Haley declared, to warm cheers from the large pro-Israeli crowd.
And I wantedto let them to know that, look, that happened but it will never happen again. The days of Israel-bashing are over. Trumps administration has already made several gestures to reassure Israels government that, in Haleys words to AIPAC, a new sheriff is in town and US policy has changed.
Welcoming Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House last month, Trump did tell his guest that he would like Israel to hold back on settlements for a little bit. But he and Haley have repudiated the critical vote and he has appointed an ambassador to Israel -- David Friedman -- with a history of skepticism toward a two-state peace deal.
US officials still insist they support the eventual goal of Israel and a future Palestine living side-by-side within agreed borders -- but they will not pressure the Jewish state for concessions.
Israeli leaders, in turn, have expressed confidence.
Ambassador Ron Dermer told AIPAC: For the first time in many years... there is no daylight between our two governments. Now, Netanyahus government want Trump and Friedman to make good on a campaign promise to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which Israel claims as its undivided capital.
Such a move would dismay Palestinians and some Arab leaders, and US officials have not repeated the promise since Trump came to office, but Netanyahu alluded to it in his remarks to AIPAC.
David, I look forward to welcoming you warmly to Israel and especially to Jerusalem, he said, speaking by videolink to pass a message to the ambassador and his supporters. - AFP

Spotting the worlds largest animal can be a thrilling experience indeed. It is one of the most sought after experiences among the tourists who visit Sri Lanka. There are several spots around the island where you can do this, depending on the season. Mirissa, which is on the southern tip, is considered one of the best sites in the world to spot Blue, Sperm and Killer whales.
What is unique about the Blue whales around Sri Lanka are that some colonies remain in the same area throughout the year while most whales worldwide travel thousands of kilometers each year in search of food sources. Therefore whales can be seen throughout year in Sri Lanka but there are peaks months where the migrant whales join the feast.
The Blue Whales are seen in three locations off the coast of Sri Lanka: Mirissa, Kalpitiya and Trincomalee. Mirissa is the prime spot out of the three. The Mirissa sea is unique in many ways, being up to 300 meters deep within close vicinity to the shore. This specialty is what makes these waters well-suited for marine mammal watching. The success rate of spotting Blue whales is almost 100 percent. The peak seasons for whale watching is from November to April.
Now you can celebrate the festive season ahead with a ride on one of the yachts offered by, Sail Lanka, the pioneer in Sri Lanka yachting and coastal cruises. They have introduced an exciting new package - The Massage Cruise on one of their 53 - foot catamarans. This new offering of an once-in-a-lifetime romantic private sailing experience includes Ayurveda masseurs on-board to attend to their guests.

Where have thee sparrows gone world sparrow day was on March 20
The World Sparrow Day fell on March 20. Amidst the hustle and bustle of the daily life of humans, many of them had enough compassion to spare a thought for one of the littlest creatures that share this planet with them  the chirpy house sparrow, on World Sparrow Day, March 20. Sadly though, many humans were unconcerned and let that day pass. I say sadly, because the house sparrow or "ge kurulla" (Passer domesticus), which all Sri Lankans enjoyed seeing in our homes and gardens in our childhood years is flying into oblivion.
Let us examine why we see so few of the chirpy little birds these days. If we can understand the reasons for a once all too common bird to be so rare these days, then perhaps we can drag them from the edge of extinction.
I grew up in the verdant village of Kosgama in the Kelani Valley. My grandma used to hang on the outside wall of aunt Littys bedroom facing the broad compound, a small pot with a hole in the center for these birds to enter it and make nests, usually with straw. Indeed, these birds nests were a common sight throughout rural Sri Lanka. For, house sparrows were considered a symbol of good luck, plentiful harvests, bringing cheer and happiness to the household. I also remember, the bolder birds, hopping along the open verandah with their heads cocked to a side, looking for fallen grain or insects such as ants.
After the harvest in late March or early April, when sacks of paddy would be carted in from the rice fields, a host of in-house servants and village women would boil the grain with the husk intact and spread them on long wide reed mats on the compound for sun drying. It looked like an open invitation to a multitude of birds  sparrows, mynas, magpies, babblers and parakeets to descend on the mats to feed on the tempting feast spread thereon. My three playmates, Ran Menika, Karuna and Simon were placed at strategic positions to shoo the birds away, while I took aim at them, the birds, not the playmates, with a catapult. (For details, please read Flickering Fortunes in Changing Ceylon of mid-20th Century).
Such scenes are rare, if not non-existent in modern Sri Lanka as it is evolving from the old village based agrarian economy into an urbanized service based industrial economy. And, therein lies the cause of the vanishing sparrow  loss of habitat and food supply due to the spreading bane of urbanization.
Whereas in earlier times the birds would fly off in the morning to nearby feeding grounds such as grass fields, today they do not have even the extensive lawns of houses to forage for grass seed and insects.
Even the architecture of the houses is different today, many of them being sleek with straight walls and no curves or corners for the birds to anchor their nests.
Urbanization with no thought for the natural environment, has resulted, methinks, in the loss of the milk of human kindness for our avian friends, or in other words the human protection that ensured them food, shelter and housing, much the same as we humans need for our survival.
What can we do to help bring back these little creatures from the precipice Maybe, just maybe, commemorate World Sparrow Day by hanging a wooden bird house from the rafters, inviting them to nest there and keeping a supply of grain and water for their consumption. I remember the late Cyril Gardiner, then Chairman of the iconic Galle Face Hotel in Colombo, used to harbor a family of chattering sparrows building an ever-growing nest of straw on the huge wooden beams near the entrance to the grand ballroom. One day, after an early morning dip in the hotel swimming pool, I was rushing to my room upstairs, when I noticed a hotel worker cleaning the marble floor of what appeared to be bird droppings. When I paused to enquire, he pointed his finger upward and on looking up, I noticed the very happy family of sparrows that had taken residence in the legendary heritage hotel. At breakfast, I asked Cyril, why he was allowing wild birds to use his polished floor as a toilet. His answer revealed a very compassionate man worthy of emulation by us all. Said Cyril,"Lakshman, they are also Gods little creatures and have every right to be in my hotel"!! (From the book Soaring Spirits and Shooting Stars)
On the other hand, I was also witness to the massive "anti-sparrow campaign" in Maoist China in the late 1950s, when millions of the birds were destroyed as they were considered to be pests eating thousands of pounds of grain in the fields. The campaign ended in disaster as with the elimination of sparrows, the grain feeding insects increased, causing near famine in the farmlands.
Sparrows have lived with humans for thousands of years and are indigenous to Asia, Africa and Europe and introduced to America and Australia by settlers. They are among the few species of birds that engage in dust baths.
Sparrows were associated by the ancient Greeks with Aphrodite, the goddess of love, due to their perceived lustfulness, an association echoed by writers as Chaucer and Shakespeare in Hamlet. Jesus' use of "sparrows" as an example of divine providence in the Gospel of Matthew also inspired later references, such as that in the Gospel hymn His Eye Is on the Sparrow. Sparrows are represented in ancient Egyptian art rarely, but an Egyptian hieroglyph is based on the house sparrow: The symbol had no phonetic value and was used as a determinative in words to indicate small, narrow, or bad.

Why Sri Lanka needs reconciliation
It should have been a political bombshell of huge magnitude but it turned out not to be. It should have halted the Joint Opposition SLFP factions fascination with Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, but it did not. Recently in the course of case proceedings in the Mt.Lavinia Magistrates Court into the murder of Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), the countrys premier criminal investigative department of the Police, revealed in Court, that the Sri Lankan militarys intelligence apparatus had run a death squad operation, which was outside the militarys normal chain of command and directly overseen by the then President Rajapaksas brother and Defence Secretary Gotabhaya.
The next day as expected, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa issued the standard blanket denial, which was the hall mark of the Rajapaksa Administration, of any such role or responsibility for a military intelligence death squad. However, this piece of evidence by the CID raises serious issues for Sri Lanka and her democracy and require careful, fulsome and comprehensive public debate, which also cannot and should not be squashed through self-censorship and media manipulation.
1. It is CID evidence in court, not a political claim on a platform
WasimThajudeen
During the 2015 presidential election, the issue of the fear psychosis in Sri Lankan society, the brutality of the Rajapaksa Administration, the white van syndrome, abductions, the forced disappearance culture and the allegation that the national security apparatus which had been so effective against the LTTE was now being turned against democratic political opponents of the Rajapaksas had been alleged from the political platform. But it was two years later, that the credible information available at the time of the campaign had now translated itself into evidence acceptable in a court of law, under the evidence ordinance.
The CID was not merely repeating the claims made by the then Army Commander, about his intelligence wing, but had, we can safely assume, as is common in any investigation crossed checked with other witnesses, suspects and sources.
2. The Rajapaksas tried to politicize the military but failed
The Rajapaksas unsuccessfully sought to politicize the Sri Lankan military and use it as a political tool. By and large, Sri Lankas fighting forces, our best, resisted this effort and continued in the best traditions of a professional military which did not seek to bow to the illegal whims and fancies of a government of the day. In mid night attempts to use the military to suspend the results of the January 2015 election the Rajapaksas failed.
The postal voting from places such as Jaffna district where the bulk of the Army is stationed and postal voters are mostly the military, demonstrated that the military rank and file comprehensively rejected the Rajapaksas. It is perhaps only in the shadowy world of military intelligence in the capital Colombo and the south, that the lethal force of the States national security apparatus was turned on democratic political opponents.
Civilian control of the military is an essential feature of a democracy. What the CID evidence reveals in the Wickrematunge murder was clear, that the military apparatus headed by the Presidents brother operated as a law unto itself and was accountable to no one. Not only the military intelligence but from Avant Garde to Rakna Lanka, from the new Defense headquarters building fund to dalliance with violent extremist groups it is clear that the Rajapaksa defense set up was accountable to no one. Not Parliament, the Auditor General or any other statutory or state body.
During the conflict era, maximum operational leeway needs to be given a military to conduct operations and as former President Jayewardena famously quoted the ancient Roman Empire Eras Senator and philosopher Cicero, in the fight of good against evil, the laws are silent. However now, the evil threat of the LTTE to Sri Lanka was comprehensively eliminated on the banks of the Nandikadal lagoon in 2009.
We cannot and must not live in peace time, like in war time. We cannot have a war psychosis, which adds to the anxiety of the populace, negates the comprehensive nature of the victory won by the armed forces and significantly reduces the normalization of society and confidence in law and order required for investment, commerce and economic prosperity. The military intelligence must be held totally accountable to Parliament. Currently the worlds most powerful military, the US military and its civilian executive leadership holds itself accountable to a variety of Congressional committees.
3. Implications for the Thajudeen murder and other crimes
The existence of state controlled, military intelligence linked illegal armed assassins and hit squads have serious implications for the ongoing investigations into the murder of former Thomian, Havelocks and national rugby player Wasim Thajudeen, the abduction of editor Keith Noyahr, Poddala Jayantha and the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda.
The allegation during the 2015 election, (It was unsafe to allege anything before an election campaign, because any one alleging anything against a Rajapaksa, ran the serious risk of sharing the same fate as either Keith Noyar, Poddala Jayantha or the ultimate fate of Thajudeen and Ekneligoda among others), was that these were ordered and carried out by state actors under government orders.
The CID in the Lasantha Wickramatunge case, is now presenting evidence to corroborate this in court. It is in this context, that President Sirisena has stated that if he had challenged the Rajapaksas and lost, he would have been six feet under (killed).
Sri Lanka post the end of the war, must have a public life and social culture that is different from the national security state of the war decades. Our people demanded better in 2015 and our future generations deserve better. The CID evidence, is one more fact, which clearly reveals why Sri Lanka needs real reform, including security sector reform. Nationalist elements bristle when there is criticism of the Sri Lankan state and her institutions and through the Joint Opposition (JO) having been blocking every attempt at real reform.
Military intelligence death squads unleased against democratic political opposition in post war peace times, demonstrates exactly why Sri Lanka needs national reconciliation and deep social healing.

Wisdom mind power seminar trains life mastery skills
Everybody is now in a rat race to obtain higher level of qualifications, intending to get better jobs for higher remuneration packages and also for prestige. We see various institutes offering MBA s, MSc s and many other certificate level to post graduate level courses.
Thousands of people follow these and get certified and qualified. The question is whether they achieve the ultimate purpose of having such a certificate in their file. A very few individuals who have an outstanding personality would definitely achieve their targets.
Many others get frustrated by not reaching the next level in their life and profession, in spite of their paper qualifications.
How many of the adults passed out of the schools can face an interview successfully with confidence How many of the University graduates can do justice to their degree certificates when they face the job interview Although they have learnt English at school and university, how many can confidently speak the language fluently Some people know grammar very well but they mumble when they have to speak a few words because of too much of grammar consciousness or because of language phobia.
School leavers, graduates, professionals and business leaders are all in the same boat.
One may perform very well in some areas and do very badly in some other areas.One may lack confidence to go to a stage and make a presentation or a speech to an audience. One may have hesitation to have fellowship in a social gathering, to mix up with people.
For instance, you may have observed that some people enjoy to the fullest singing ,dancing, chatting and having fun with every one around while you confine yourself to one or two known friends and spend the whole time with no much fun. You may perhaps suffer from the fear to move around. You may overdo things at such places not knowing the standard etiquette (manners) to follow.
Why struggle in the same level of life for years and suffer In work life you may suffer with numerous communication problems, relationship issues, misunderstandings, not getting the promotion you want, earning too low when compared to the qualifications you have obtained. You may have studied overseas in a prestigious university and come back but you may have personality issues. You may be frustrated about life. You may be getting annoyed and angry for no big reason. You may lack people handling skills and therefore hate others while you are also being hated by others.
Trainer Kuma Iddamalena says the problem is not the problem but how you look at the problem. Whether it is a personal life problem, business or carrier issue the same theory applies. Learn to see the problem as it is, not bigger than that.
The mind power seminar on Empowered Living will help those in need.
