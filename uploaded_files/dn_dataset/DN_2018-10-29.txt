First ever TAVI performed at Durdans Hospital
The first ever balloon expandable transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) (without open heart surgery) was performed on an 82 year old patient with Ischemic Heart Disease and poor lung function by Dr Pandula Athauda-Arachchi Resident Consultant Interventional Cardiologist of Durdans Hospital. This was the first time that a procedure of this nature was done in Sri Lanka under local anaesthetic without any complications, with the patient being fully awake.
Previously, the patient had had a stent placed and undergone a balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) performed by Dr Athauda Arachchi which was a temporary solution to buy more time until long term treatment was made available. The continuing deterioration of the patients condition prompted Dr AthaudaArachchi to obtain permission from the ethics committee of the hospital (since it was a first time procedure) to implant a transcatheter aortic valve. Owing to the experience and TAVI accreditation gained by doctor as a Consultant in the UK this first time procedure was deemed possible along with the availability of the valve.
After conducting thorough TOE and CT assessments, the procedure, a minimalistic approach without any surgical input, was performed by inserting a catheter through the groin arteries under local anaesthetic only where the patient was awake for the entire procedure. Pre-dilation balloon expansion was administered, the aortic valve assembled through the aortic annulus and the valve implanted under rapid pacing. Resulting in a perfect aortic valve without any complications or bleeding during or after the procedure.
Immediately after the procedure the patient was able to perform activities such as eating, passing urine, etc and 12 hours after the procedure patient was able to get out of bed and mobilise. The results are comparable to patients I have treated similarly in United Kingdom, Dr said.
We want to get the technology in here because there are many heart valve patients who are declined surgery due to co-morbidity. These patients can be treated with this minimalistic approach. At Durdans, the presence of comprehensive heart teams with cardiac surgical/ cardiac anaesthesia backup helps cardiac specialists boldly perform procedures like this without hesitation, he added.

Former PM must vacate Temple Trees - Prasanna
Former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe could be taken into custody for misusing public property, retired Major, attorney Ajith Prasanna said.
Since the day President Maithripala Sirisena issued two extraordinary gazette notifications removing Ranil Wickremesinghe from the post and appointing Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new Prime Minister, former Prime Minister Wickremesinghe should vacate his official residence Temple Trees, but he has failed to do that.
Addressing media at the Prime Ministers office UPFA Kalutara District MP Piyal Nishantha charged that Rajitha Senaratne is a most powerful conspirator in this country and he, Patali and some other politicians who cannot engage in politics without power are misleading Ranil Wickremesinghe in order to fulfill their personal wishes. He further charged that powerful politicians were involved in the assassination plot of the President and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and the President is very well aware the entire conspiracy.

Fruit garden for every school
The Agriculture Ministry recently launched a programme to set up fruit gardens in schools and religious premises.
Under this programme, the setting up of fruit gardens in the Jayewardenepura Educational Zone was implemented in 89 schools on Friday (26).
The planting of fruit saplings at the M.D.H. Jayawardena College in Thalangama under this programme was held under the patronage of Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
The minster also granted hybrid jak saplings to the teachers and academic staff of the school.
Addressing the ceremony, the minister said that at present, a large number of fruits that could be grown within the country are being imported. But no one knows what the pesticides and chemicals used to preserve these fruits are. There is no inspection on this matter.
Sri Lanka is a country where rice and chili are popularly consumed. A majority of the local chili requirement at present is fulfilled with the imports from India or Pakistan. Last year chilies to the value of Rs. 1,800 crores were imported to the country. Now, it is our plan to curtail the imports and to grow them within the country itself, he said.
He also added that with the new programme launched on Friday, it was his intention to set up a fruit garden in each school of the island. The minister also expected the support of each and person to make that programme a success.
Principal of the school, officers of the Zonal Education Office of Jayewardenepura, teachers, and the students of the school participated in the occasion.
According to the Agriculture Ministry, this programme will be implemented through the environmental circles of each school and students will be assigned to look after each and every fruit sapling planted within the school premises.

Gardens ease distress and evoke memories
In the world of garden design, it seems we cant get enough of the dramatic, the breathtaking and that all-important wow factor. But when it comes to gardens that are good for mental health, theres a different kind of showstopper that can do us all a power of good.
Visitors to this years Bord Bia Bloom festival will have a chance to experience this for themselves with one of the shows highlights, a garden called Moments in Time designed especially for people with dementia.
Sponsored by the HSEs Understand Together team, the project is a collaboration between landscape gardener Clive Jones of Newtown Saunders, TrinityHaus research centre at TCD, and Sonas apc, a charity that provides training and support for people with dementia and their carers.
Its the second successive year the team has brought a dementia-friendly garden to Bloom, following the silver medal-winning success of their previous entry, set in an urban garden. This year theyre going for gold by turning their attention to public spaces.
We want to showcase how communities can create a garden designed to stimulate the senses for people with dementia, and provide a place where those with the disease and their carers can come together and socialise, says Clive Jones.
With a dementia-friendly garden, you dont want to overdo the bling. It has to be very calming and stimulate the senses in a deep, meaningful way, enabling people with dementia to access long-forgotten memories and reduce anxiety.
The Moments in Time garden is an oasis filled with different colours, aromas, sounds and textures, featuring a circular, weaving walkway with coloured concrete and brightly coloured handrails to encourage ease of access.
The walkway has a number of zones, each with raised beds filled with distinct planting to tap into the five senses and evoke memories, says Clive. Weve used more than 30 types of plants, flowers and shrubs, including lavender, wild grasses, hydrangeas, bright daisies, forest ferns and lemon thyme, which has a wonderful scent.
The idea of creating a dementia-friendly garden came to Clive almost by accident, during a casual conversation with Professor Mark Dyer, director of TrinityHaus.
He told me his team was researching how buildings could be designed for people with dementia, and I asked, What about the gardens he says. Further research between the partners led to Sonas apc coming on board. The team now designs gardens for nursing and care homes nationwide.
Its not a one-design-fits-all process, says Clive. We did a garden for a nursing home in Kinsale with a nautical theme. Each project has to reflect its own local history and heritage so that people can connect with it. independent

Get breathing space from that annoying office mate!
Whether you are an extrovert who will do anything for attention or the quietest introvert ever, attention does have its price. And unwanted attention comes with a very steep price, since it is usually more of a pain than flattery. Now, Im not talking about celebrities who spend their entire lives stabbing people in the back to be on the cover of People Magazine, only to hide behind sunglasses once they get there. What Im talking about is us regular folk who have to deal with unwanted attention at some point in our lives.
Which brings us to the annoying co-workers who are about as common as annoying meetings. No matter where you work, there is always going to be someone who could very well be the most annoying person that ever existed. And unfortunately, there is always one person that this annoying co-worker latches onto.
This person will spend too much time at your cubicle or office. They will always ask you to lunch (although youll never ask them). Theyll call and email you pictures or funny articles that arent funny and have nothing to do with work. If you are the one who attracts such an annoying co-worker, then Im very sorry for you. But have no fear because there is light at the end of the tunnel. Only just dont turn around because chances are that annoying co-worker followed you into that tunnel.
Because this is your workplace, you have to be careful about how you deal with a co-worker who gives you unwanted attention. You cant be as stern as you may be with someone in your personal life. Since you see this person every day and honestly, may even end up working directly with or even for them at some point, you dont want to burn any bridges. So straight-shooting and telling this person flat out to leave you alone is not an option.
Yes, there is one in every office, the loud talker, the cubicle invader or the perpetual procrastinator. Annoying co-workers can be an encumbrance, particularly when they interfere with your productivity.
There is the guy who points a finger at you in a gun motion and orders you to "smile," or the woman who stops by to chat about her six cats for 45 minutes. There's Giggles two cubicles away who thinks everything is funny and you can't escape overhearing how hysterical it is. Or Baby Talk who is constantly cooing to his girlfriend.
There are even more difficult colleagues particularly those whose personalities get in the way of your work. They are constantly on the defensive, scheming or rude. They include the aggressive types the passive-aggressive types, the whiners and the know-alls.
But annoying people can become toxic to your workday. Those small predicaments tend to build up, and can turn reasonable people into human land mines. Honest solutions to little problems can keep you from going off the deep end.
Before you erupt in rage over a co-workers annoying habits, consider these tips to improve the situation without getting written up by human resources or even worse, losing your job. One of the most common complaints from workers who spend their days toiling away in cubicles or open areas is lingering co-workers who drop by without an invitation.
They may be friendly enough, but not only do they invade your work space, they also tend to monopolise your time with endless banter.
Everyone can benefit from a knowledgeable co-worker, but the one that seems to have done it all or knows everything about anything can be downright infuriating. While it may be satisfying to tell that co-worker to shove it, that could land you in hot water with your employer.
The know-all has an opinion on everything and loves to tell you how to do your job better. The solution is to let it roll right off your back.
The more you ignore this person and dont let him or her get to you, the better. When they offer an unsolicited opinion, say: Thanks, I'll think about that. And if you find yourself getting frustrated, comfort yourself with the knowledge that this person is widely considered obnoxious. You definitely are not the only one being irritated.
When the co-worker offers unsolicited advice thank the offender and say youll consider it.
Then there is the loud talker. Despite sitting on the other side of the floor, you may know intimate details about a co-worker's life thanks to his or her lack of volume control.
Loud talkers are distracting, but in many cases they arent aware of how loud they are speaking. Or they could be suffering from a hearing difficulty.
Another variant on the loud talker is the co-worker who simply talks too much. A simple question can lead to a 20-minute conversation about non-work issues, setting you back in your work.
You have to be assertive in this situation and not let the person have so much power over how you spend your time. Tell the co-worker that you are on deadline.
If that fails simply say you need to stop talking and get back to work.
The blabbermouth goes on and on and on. He or she is especially talented at roping you into long conversations that never end when you are on deadline or trying to make a phone call.
In fact, with most types of annoying co-workers, the solution is simply to be straightforward and assertive. Not angry, not hostile, just direct.
But that is something that can make people anxious, so it is important to know that it's really okay to speak up for yourself in a matter-of-fact, professional way.
And if that fails, just be glad these people arent in your family.
At the end of the day, dealing with an annoying co-worker is part of office life and something that needs to be handled tactfully so as not to hurt someones feelings. After all, you may be committing some of the mentioned offences and not even know it. [emailprotected]

Governors extend support to President Sirisena
The Governors of all the nine provinces, after a meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena, have unanimously decided to extend their fullest support to the new government of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The Governors, addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, said as President Sirisenas representatives to the respective provinces, they would be with the President on any decision taken by him for the betterment of the country.
Addressing the media, Western Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara said the political instability that prevailed in the country, continuous depreciation of the rupee, recently revealed assassination plot on the President, and the scope of private and public sector investments that prevented foreign investment into the country were the causes for this new change in the countrys political arena.
Eastern Province Governor Rohitha Bogollagama said he agreed on the decision taken by President Sirisena as the head of the country, government, and the Cabinet of Ministers and would extend his fullest support on behalf of the people of the Eastern Province.
He said this decision, which is constitutional, was taken by the President at a time when the country was becoming unstable.
Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray in his remarks said the National Unity Government had led the country towards an unstable and anarchical era. It also failed to protect their slogan of anti-corruption while they were in power. Therefore, he said that he believed this new initiative would be the beginning of a stable era in the country.
North Western Province Governor K.C. Logeswaran said the decision by the President was based on a number of issues that came up during the previous regime. He said he recently found that the powers given to local government bodies in his Province had been completely derogated and that situation would not arise in the future.
Sabaragamuwa Province Governor Niluka Ekanayake said she expected that the newly appointed Prime Minister would work for the betterment of the country, people, race and the religion during his tenure.
The North Central, Central, Uva, and Southern Province Governors also expressed their views at this press conference.
Answering the questions raised by the journalists, Governor Nanayakkara said that the appointment of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new Prime Minister is a very clear process and is constitutional. But, some lawyers can express ideas according to their political or personal opinion.
He said adjourning Parliament till November 16 was due to two reasons. One is the new government has to get ready for a Vote on Account in the Parliament. The other is to appoint the Secretaries to the new Ministries, and to appoint the heads and board of directors to public sector institutions and the banks. Therefore, anyone can show the House that they have the majority in the Parliament even on November 16, the Governor said.

## Title: How import taxes drive up the cost of living
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

How import taxes drive up the cost of living
The Lanka Confectionery Manufacturers Association (LCMA) is actively seeking Government intervention to introduce a negative list of manufacturing to safeguard local firms engaged in the industry before opening up the economy to giants like India and China.
The above extracted from a financial daily is an illustration of a phenomenon that is common in Sri Lanka  an industry seeking protection from foreign competition. This protection generally takes the form of a tariff  a tax that is imposed on the imported product that is not applied to the domestic equivalent. In the above instance the LCMA is requesting that the existing tariff protection enjoyed by the industry is continued even if a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is signed. (An item in the negative list of an FTA is not subject to the FTA). For example imported biscuits are taxed at a total of around 107% of price, if biscuits are on the negative list this tax would continue, despite the FTA.
Although a tariff is imposed, this does not generally cause foreign exporters to reduce the price that they charge for the product. Therefore the domestic price of the imported product rises by the amount of the tariff.
Domestic producers competing with these imports do not have to pay the import tax, so have an advantage over the imported product. As the price of imported products rise, domestic producers have the opportunity to raise their own selling prices because competing imported products now cost more.
Will the domestic producer raise his prices Yes, it makes no sense otherwise. If the domestic producers were to set his prices at exactly the same level he would, if imports were not taxed there would be no point in seeking tariff protection from imports. The very purpose of the tariff is to enable the domestic producer to sell his product at a higher price. The domestic producer is thus better off as a result of the tariff.
What happens to consumers
Domestic consumers of the product are equally affected by the imposition of the tariff. They must pay a higher price for both imported and local products.
In other words, the protection for domestic industry is actually paid for by domestic consumers, in the form of higher prices.
What of the Government that imposes the tariff
The government collects tariff revenue, on whatever quantity is imported, although they do not collect it on the local product. The benefit that the Government creates for the local producer by raising the price of imports is collected by the producer. This surplus is called a rent.
We thus have two domestic winners (domestic producers and the government) and one domestic loser (domestic consumers) because of the imposition of a tariff.
Charge higher prices
The local producer who is able to charge a higher price from the consumer thanks to the tariff on competing imports is said to enjoy a rent. In economics, a rent, is an unearned reward. The producer is able to charge a higher price not because of superior quality or service but because a tax imposed by the Government.
If the producer was able to charge a higher price because of better quality, even while cheaper imports were available the producer would be earning the premium price. There is an important distinction here.
Consumers would only buy a more expensive product while lower priced products are available only if they valued what they were getting. The producer must do something extra to persuade consumers that his product is superior and worth paying a higher price.
When a tariff raises the price of imports, local producers are able to charge higher prices with no increase in value to the consumers. Given a choice consumers may well chose cheaper alternatives  but the tariff makes sure that the alternative is no longer cheap. Consumers are thus forced to pay a higher price, not because they want to but because there is no alternative. This is why the premium in this instance is said to be unearned. Consumers do not perceive better value but pay more.
Thus producers gain at the expense of consumers. As noted before, it is domestic consumers (not foreign producers) who pay for the protection of domestic industries. The net impact is a transfer of wealth, from consumer to producer that is facilitated by the tariff. Is this good policy
If it were confined to a handful of industries it may not matter much, but in Sri Lanka it is all-pervasive. Sri Lankas cost of living is so high. All necessities from food (fruit, meats, pasta, jams) to toiletries (soap, shapoo, toothpaste) to household products attract taxes from 62%-101%.
Sri Lankan consumers suffer a high cost of living in order to support domestic industries. There is an argument that supporting local producers to build an industrial base will accelerate growth in the long run.
Japan, Korea and Taiwan practised industrial policy (IP), but even proponents of the policy admit that care is needed to pick the right industries. In Japan and Korea the main industries were steel, ship building, heavy electrical equipment, chemicals and later cars. Taiwan had light manufacturing (electrical appliances, textiles) before moving to heavy and chemical industries and electronics.
Sri Lanka seems to want to emulate this in toiletries, household cleaning products and food: soap, shampoo, washing powder, floor polish, pasta, cheese and biscuits.
To succeed, industrial policies need to foster a structural transformation in the economy that leads to rapid creation of jobs, especially more productive and better jobs. Selecting the right industries is important.
It matters how realistically the target industries are selected in light of the countrys technological capabilities and world market conditions. (HJ Chang)
Krugman summarises some criteria advanced by proponents of IP in selecting sectors:
1. High value-added per worker. Real income can rise only if resources flow to businesses that add greater value per employee.
2. Linkage industries-such as steel and semi-conductors. Industries whose outputs are used as inputs by other industries can create a cycle of industrialisation. In Japan cheap, high quality steel gave downstream industries-ships, automobiles, rails, locomotives, heavy electrical equipment - a competitive advantage.
3. Present or future competitiveness on world markets. If the industry can meet this test, we can presume that resources are being allocated efficiently. Competitiveness is critical for linkage benefits to flow.
The selected industries need to target exports (albeit not exclusively)  to achieve scale economies and because it provides a tangible criterion for the policymakers to judge the performances of the enterprises promoted by the government (Chang). The failure to promote exports is the key reason for failure of industrial policy in Latin America. (Chang, 2009)
The exports focus also ensures competitiveness. The purpose of policy is not to protect inefficiency but improve productivity.
Therefore support for industry must be conditional-on meeting performance targets.
The results of industrial policy (or indeed of any policy in general) depends critically on how effectively the state can monitor the outcome that is desired, and change the allocation and terms of support in the light of emerging results(M. Khan)
Deliberation Councils were set up in Japan and Korea which would set targets together with industry. To ensure targets were stringent they also involved independent technical experts, academics and others.
Performance would be monitored and targets revised. Where a policy was seen to be ineffective it would be revised. Industrial policy is not only about picking winners but also phasing out losers.
The success of industrial policy depends critically on how willing and able the government is to discipline the recipients of the rents that it creates through various policy means (tariffs, subsidies, entry barriers). The point is that the suspension of market discipline, which is inevitable in the conduct of industrial policy, means that the government has to play the role of a disciplinarian. (Chang)
This requires a bureaucracy insulated from political pressure to take impartial decisions on the support to industry-and change or withdraw support, depending on performance.
How closely the government interacts with the private sector while not becoming its hostage is very important.(Chang)
It becomes clear that successful industrial policy is a sophisticated partnership between industry and state, governed by the underlying principles of competitiveness and productivity. Unfortunately what takes place in Sri Lanka is unlike that of East Asia but similar to Latin America.
Import substitution policies got a bad name, especially in Latin America, because the industries that were created often only survived as the result of protection. It was particularly costly when countries protected intermediate goods, because that made goods farther down the production chain less competitive. Countries often paid a high price for this kind of protectionism, and the maintenance of this protection was often associated with corruption. (Stiglitz)

India to become worlds third largest aviation market in 2024
New Delhi: India will become the worlds third largest aviation market around 2024 surpassing the UK, global airlines body IATA, as it projected total air passenger numbers to touch 8.2 billion in 2037. Releasing the latest update to IATAs 20-year Air Passenger Forecast, the grouping also cautioned that growth prospects for air transport and the economic benefits driven by aviation could be curtailed if protectionist measures are implemented by governments. The present trends in air transport suggest passenger numbers could double to 8.2 billion in 2037, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said. The Asia-Pacific region is projected to drive the biggest growth with more than half the total number of new passengers over the next 20 years coming from these markets.
The growth is being driven by a combination of continued robust economic growth, improvements in household incomes and favourable population and demographic profiles, it noted. According to the IATA, China would displace the United States as the worlds largest aviation market in the mid-2020s.Aviation market is defined in terms of traffic to, from and within a country, as per the grouping.
India will take 3rd place after the US, surpassing the UK around 2024. Indonesia is forecast to be a standout performer - climbing from the worlds 10th largest aviation market in 2017 to the 4th largest by 2030, it said. IATA Director General and CEO Alexandre de Juniac said a doubling of air passengers in the next 20 years could support 100 million jobs globally, adding that it is seeing a geographical reshuffling of world air traffic to the East.

Secretary of Law Students Association of IDM College of Legal Studies Kavindya Bopearachchi
because after considering other equivalent institutes, for me personally this institution stood out from the rest. Ive been studying here as a full-time student under the 2nd year of LLB (Hons) Degree programme and I can honestly say that it has always been up to the expectations and more. The lecturers are very friendly and well qualified industry specialists. Everything is taught in a way that keeps us engaged and active and they also give their best individual attention to everyone and never makes anyone feel left out.
They organise many events and activities to help us interact and introduce us to people from different fields to give us a better overall learning experience. The environment is very tidy and has all the required facilities. Based on my personal experience the main reason I absolutely love and adore IDM college of legal studies is because they always put the students first and never fail to live up our expectations. If anyone is looking for a college to pursue their dream as a lawyer I would greatly recommend IDM college of legal studies, it truly is the best environment for anyone to continue their higher studies in the stream of Law, Kavindya Bopearachchi said.

UNP MP and former Public Enterprise Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the UNP has sent a written request to the Speaker asking him to convene parliament immediately.
Speaking at a media briefing yesterday he said that the Speaker has the right to convene parliament as he is above all in terms of positions.
This decision by the President is against parliamentary tradition. In April Ranil Wickremesinghe defeated the no-confidence motion. Since April, there has been no change in the majority support. He said.
He said the UNP had faith that they would be victorious. The masses have accepted this decision as being unconstitutional. So we ask the Speaker to convene parliament immediately.
Opposition Leader R.Sampanthan has also written to the Speaker calling him to convene parliament and uphold the rule of law. I call upon yourself sir to summon parliament forthwith to enable parliament to perform its legitimate functions,"Sampanthan said.

Celebrating its 10th anniversary, the Lak FM radio channel launched an awareness programme on sound pollution caused by vehicle horns. It was launched on October 1 at Kiribathgoda and continued through Town Hall, Colpetty, Thunmulla and Battaramulla.
Lak FM staff conducted the programme for drivers while participating in a demonstration with placards, posters and handouts. Lak FM Chief Executive Officer Nalaka Sanath Kumara said that their Corporate Social Responsibility Eco-centric Programme promoted sustainability and peoples well-being.
Lak FM has always been a media establishment that stood for the right cause, despite whatever obstacles it faced. We have always worked for the betterment of our society,  he said.
This endeavour is more worthwhile than distributing presents to celebrate our anniversary. This is aimed at lowering sound pollution as well as lessening the stress people undergo everyday while travelling, Kumara said.
But this program does not stop there. We are urging for an attitude change. I should pay special tribute to Lak FM Founder Attorney-at-law Wasantha Perera and Lak FM President Ashika Edirisinghe for the guidance they provide us with for this task, he said, Our staff, despite their busy schedules, as well as the inclement weather, has been dedicated to this cause.

Landslide warning for five districts
The National Building Research Organization (NBRO) yesterday issued a landslide warning for several divisional secretariats in five districts.
According to the warning, the Walapone Divisional Secretariat and the nearby areas of the Nuwara Eliya district, Ukuwela DS Division in Matale, Gangawata Korale and Udunuwara DS divisions in Kandy, Elapatha, Ratnapura, Pelmadulla, Nivithigala DS divisions in the Ratnapura district and Passara and Lunugala in Badulla are prone to landslides.
Since the rainfall in the past 24 hours has exceeded 75mm, if the rain continues, the NBRO warned people to be watchful of the possibility of landslides, slope failures, rock falls and ground subsidence.
The people in those areas must pay attention to landslide signs such as development of cracks on the ground, deepened cracks and ground subsidence and slanting of trees, NBRO stated.
Attention should also be paid to electrical posts, fences and telephone posts, cracks in the floors and walls of buildings at slopes, sudden appearance of springs, emerging muddy water and blockage or disappearance of springs. People should immediately move away from the areas where they notice pre-landslide signs.
If heavy rain continues, people living in landslide susceptible areas should be vigilant and be ready to move quickly to safe places, the NBRO said..

Laugfs SuperMart joins CH17 Loyalty
The supermarket chain of Laugfs Holdings Pvt. Limited is the latest to join the popular welfare scheme owned and managed by CH17 exclusively for employees and staff in the mercantile and corporate sectors.
Perks at Work, Nucleus Loyalty, Ransalu Privilege are three of the popular programs implemented by CH17 Loyalty for staff and employees in different sectors that play crucial roles for the economy.
In 2013, the company launched its iconic welfare scheme exclusively for the workforce in the apparel sector. Today nearly 115,000 employees, majority of them belong to the skill set of this industry enjoy year round privileges and benefits from a number of retailers of consumer brands contracted by CH17 Loyalty.
Explaining the concept, Founder and CEO of CH17 Loyalty, Jumar Preena said, We have introduced to the market a single card that allows the holder to enjoy multiple benefits and facilities from a number of retail outlets throughout the country. This is a unique concept and a first in the market. Our task is to engage as many retailers as possible across multiple retail chain on to a single loyalty platform. They are selected based on demand by the membership and the brands popularity.
Jumar further explained that in todays situation the consumers wallet is filled with different loyalty/ privilege cards issued by various retailers and service providers.
They are bulky and most of the time occupy the space meant for other important cards like the NIC, DL, Health Card and importantly cash.
Frequency of usage of these retailers privilege cards are very low as well. So we came up with this idea of introducing a single card for multiple use, co-opting all the popular and important retailers into our system, Jumar said.
CH17 Loyalty Cards are issued only to the corporates and are not available for the general public. We know our membership, who they are and where they come from. Thats where true loyalty between the seller and buyer is established, Jumar further said.
We are delighted that Laugfs SuperMart have joined our vast retail network and have been generous in their offers to our card holders. Laugfs SuperMart is quite unique in its own way. Customer friendly service and quality of their products are two of their core strengths, which are essential to win customers, Jumar added.
Murad Rahimdeen, CEO of Laugfs SuperMart thanked CH17 Loyalty for inviting them to partner with this unique corporate loyalty scheme and promised to offer many more benefits to CH17 cardholders.
He announced that the company hopes to expand its outlets in the coming months so as to reach out to more consumers in different areas.

Need of the hour
One of the main drawbacks of having a Unity Government was the need to satisfy a lot of MPs from both sides who were together in a governing coalition. Almost everyone had to be offered a ministerial post, which swelled the number of ministers to more than half of the 225 Members in Parliament. This meant that billions of rupees had to be allocated yearly for maintaining the Ministers alone, inclusive of salaries, allowances, housing, vehicles, fuel and telephones. This is an unbearable cost for an emerging country like ours, saddled with a myriad of economic problems.
With the dissolution of the National Unity Government and the appointment of new Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, the country has received a fresh opportunity to appoint a new Cabinet mainly from a single party. Indeed, this union of the Executive and the Legislature was a dire need in our political landscape. The problem of giving ministerial portfolios to MPs from two political parties does not arise as both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Rajapaksa represent a single political party.
While details of the incoming Cabinet are still not clear at this stage, there have been several statements to the effect that it will not exceed 30 Members. This is more than enough for a country of 21 million. India, which has a population of more than one billion and is at least sixty times bigger than Sri Lanka, has less than 40 Union Ministers. Britain has only 21 Cabinet Ministers, for 66 million people. The USA has only 16 Members in the (Federal) Cabinet, despite having 325 million people. Malaysia too has less than 30 Members in the Cabinet for a population of 31 million. It should indeed be possible for a country like ours to manage with a 30 Member Cabinet.
There is a need to abolish meaningless ministries that are given just to satisfy MPs. Reading through the previous Cabinet List, it is clear that some ministries have no meaning and function at all. Thus there is a need to identify the most essential ministries that can take the country forward. Among them are Defence (normally vested with the President himself), Finance and Commerce, Foreign Affairs, Agriculture, Education and Higher Education, Lands, Health, Transport and Aviation, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Power and Energy, Youth and Sports, Media and Communications, Industries and Exports, Home Affairs and Local Government, Labour, Womens and Childrens Affairs, Tourism, Culture and Arts, Housing, Rural Development, Plan Implementation and Science and Technology. One has to remember that deputy ministers are also appointed for these ministries, which takes the total to well over 60. The Prime Minister is also traditionally entrusted with a number of ministries.
Keeping government expenditure down should be a major challenge for the Government. There has been a tendency in recent times for Government expenses to spiral out of control, with some ministers ordering super luxury cars worth over Rs.60 million. Many politicians also develop a penchant for selecting first or business class when they go overseas, which makes quite a dent in the national coffers. They should be told to fly economy whenever they can at least on short haul flights. Government Ministries, Provincial Councils and Local Bodies must always bear in mind that they spend peoples funds  the Western Provincial Council recently got a lot of flak for trying to order super luxury chairs and air freshener machines. One Ministry was spending Rs.20 million per month to rent a luxury building in Rajagiriya, while plenty of space was available in Government offices rent-free. If serving the people is the aim, such luxuries are not necessary.
Our Ministers and politicians must also give up the habit of going in convoys. Only the President and the Prime Minister should use motorcades for security reasons. All other ministers should be allocated only one vehicle and they should obey all road rules, just like other motorists. There is no need for them to use several backup vehicles in peace time. People are fed up having to give way to politicians in a hurry, whose security details shove the other motorists aside as they fly on the road. Stern action should be taken against any politician caught breaking road rules.
We have stated in these columns before the importance of MPs attending Parliament on session days. It is somewhat distressing to see row upon row of empty benches even when Parliament is debating an issue of national importance. Millions of rupees in public funds are used to maintain the MPs and the Parliament  they should make use of that opportunity to raise their voice on behalf of the public.
There are many other challenges before the incoming Government, but these are some of the people-friendly measures it could adopt without much trouble. Accountability and transparency should be the keywords as it seeks to shape the future of Sri Lanka.

Omelette bars
If you are a fan of eggs then listen up, as theres about to be a whole new way to eat an omelette.
You may think theres only one way to cook and eat the eggy snack, but thats about to change with the invention of Scramblers bars. A Kickstarter campaign has launched to secure the 11,570 needed to get the bars off the ground. With more than 10,000 pledged and nearly a month to go, we could be seeing these bars on supermarket shelves in the near future.
Described as the original omelet bar, they come in three different flavours  bacon and cheese, feta and spinach and spicy chicken sausage. And the company has claimed its bars have a 12-month shelf life, despite not containing anything artificial or preservatives.
Describing how, the Kickstarter campaign explains, Almost as if by magic, Scramblers bars keep for up to 12 months without refrigeration or chemical preservatives.
So if you forget about a bar at the back of the cupboard, its not a problem.
Theyre made by individually heat-sealing each bar in an air-tight tray, which can then be eaten at room temperature or heated up in the microwave.
And Scramblers said they are surprisingly moist. Theyre trying to use pasture-raised organic eggs, superior to other types of eggs on the market. Their list of achievements goes on, with the bars said to be keto-friendly, clean-label and shelf-stable, as well as being low-carb.
They said, One of the most original, innovative snacks in years, Scramblers bars are fully cooked, omelet-inspired breakfast bars. We use top-quality, transparently-sourced ingredients, like Organic, Pasture-Raised Eggs and Grass-Fed Ghee. We know how crazy mornings can be and how limited are the great tasting and healthy on-the-go options. People can pledge their support for the idea, and you can be among some of the first people to try the bars if they get funded. The Sun

President reveals of Ministerial hand to assassinate him
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday disclosed that there was the involvement of a Cabinet Minister in a plot to assassinate him and that there had been tremendous pressure on investigations.
There were instances of some responsible officers of the Attorney Generals Department evading investigation duties. Under these political problems, economic troubles and the strong plot to assassinate me, the only alternative open to me was to invite former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and appoint him as Prime Minister to form a new government the President said in a special address to the nation.
He said: Recently, a person called Namal Kumara came before the media and disclosed about a plot to assassinate me and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. I handed over the task of investigations to the Criminal Investigations Department. However, Inspector General of Police did not assign the investigations to the CID.
Instead he said it was given to another division. Then he (President)realised that there was an issue of trust about the investigations. Within 48 hours of the disclosure made to the media by the person called Namal Kumara and investigations could be commenced on the plot, Inspector General of Police made a statement stating that there was a doubt about the voices in the tape recording provided by that person.
I would like to raise the question, with respect, is it suitable for a Police chief to behave in such a shameless manner and express doubts about the recording, without seeking any technical expert advice on the tape recording, when there was a revelation that a plot was hatched to assassinate the President of the country
The President also said once forming the government, former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe arrogantly and stubbornly avoided collective decisions, and tended to take individual decisions. This behaviour led to many conflicts. Due to his lack of collective decision making through discussion, our country had to face harsh consequences when he used to take decisions with a group of his very close associates.
I suggested to him that we should take our decisions after proper discussion to achieve the goals of good governance. However, he ignored the aspirations of over six million and two hundred thousand people. I am very worried about that. I accepted the leadership of this country to ensure creative governance upholding the principles of good governance and that is free of corruption or fraud.
The President also said that the committee set up by Ranil Wickremesinghe to manage economy was totally fraudulent. The decisions taken by that committee were fraudulent. It was a major challenge to abolish it.
As an alternative to that Committee, I have established the National Economic Council. Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe has taken everything possible to weaken that Commission. The monthly emoluments for the economic expert, who was appointed the head of the Commission was paid by an international monetary institution respected by all of us. On Mr Wickremesinghes advise, that payment was stopped. Mr Wickremesinghe took steps to prevent the Commission from functioning. I clearly state that this crisis situation has emerged due to Mr Wickremesinghes stubborn decisions, the President said .
I believe that the result of the Local Government elections that was held last February was a warning by the people to correct the course of the government. At that moment, I called Mr. Wickremesinghe and other leaders of the UNP and explained People have taught us a lesson about the way we have governed, and we must correct ourselves now. And I told Mr Wickremesinghe; You have acquired my powers to do what you did, and I silently gave you that power in gratitude as you took leadership to bring me to power. As a result of my gratefulness, which is a noble human quality, the country had to suffer very bad consequences.
The President also said the former Prime Ministers political conduct was unbecoming of civilised politics and and Wickremesinghe and his group of closest friends, who belonged to a privileged class and did not understand the pulse of the people and conducted themselves as if shaping the future of the country was a fun game they played. I feel that Hon. Wickremesinghe grossly violated the very principles of good governance we pledged to uphold.
Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe and the UNP complain that the establishment of a new government and appointment of Mr Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister was contradictory to the provisions of the Constitution of Sri Lanka.
I categorically state that the appointment were made totally in accordance with the Constitution and the on advice of legal experts. No constitutional violation was done when appointments were made and removal was enacted. With all respect, I completely reject the charge that what was done was a violation of the Constitution.

Pros and cons of currency devaluation
There have been debates about the value of our rupee against the Dollar. The same is true in India. The piece today presents a few basics on the topic.
Ever since world currencies abandoned the gold standard and allowed their exchange rates to float freely against each other, there have been many currency devaluation events that have hurt not only the citizens of the country involved but have also rippled across the globe. If the fallout can be so widespread, why do countries devalue their currency
To Boost Exports
On a world market, goods from one country must compete with those from all other countries. Car makers in America must compete with car makers in Europe and Japan. If the value of the euro decreases against the dollar, the price of the cars sold by European manufacturers in America, in dollars, will be effectively less expensive than they were before. On the other hand, a more valuable currency make exports relatively more expensive for purchase in foreign markets.
In other words, exporters become more competitive in a global market. Exports are encouraged while imports are discouraged. There should be some caution, however, for two reasons. First, as the demand for a countrys exported goods increases worldwide, the price will begin to rise, normalizing the initial effect of the devaluation. The second is that as other countries see this effect at work, they will be incentivized to devalue their own currencies in kind in a so-called race to the bottom. This can lead to tit for tat currency wars and lead to unchecked inflation.
To Shrink Trade Deficits
Exports will increase and imports will decrease due to exports becoming cheaper and imports more expensive. This favours an improved balance of payments as exports increase and imports decrease, shrinking trade deficits. Devaluing the home currency can help the correct balance of payments and reduce these deficits.
There is a potential downside to this rationale, however. Devaluation also increases the debt burden of foreign-denominated loans when priced in the home currency.
To Reduce Sovereign Debt Burdens
A government may be incentivized to encourage a weak currency policy if it has a lot of government-issued sovereign debt to service on a regular basis. If debt payments are fixed, a weaker currency makes these payments effectively less expensive over time.
Take for example a government who has to pay $1 million each month in interest payments on its outstanding debts. But if that same $1 million of notional payments becomes less valuable, it will be easier to cover that interest. In our example, if the domestic currency is devalued to half of its initial value, the $1 million debt payment will only be worth $500,000 now.
The Bottom Line
Currency devaluations can be used by countries to achieve economic policy. Having a weaker currency relative to the rest of the world can help boost exports, shrink trade deficits and reduce the cost of interest payments on its outstanding government debts.
There are, however, some negative effects of devaluations.
Advantages and disadvantages of devaluation
Advantages of devaluation
1. Exports become cheaper and more competitive to foreign buyers. Therefore, this provides a boost for domestic demand and could lead to job creation in the export sector.
2. A higher level of exports should lead to an improvement in the current account deficit. This is important if the country has a large current account deficit due to a lack of competitiveness.
3. Higher exports and aggregate demand (AD) can lead to higher rates of economic growth.
4. Devaluation is a less damaging way to restore competitiveness than internal devaluation. Internal devaluation relies on deflationary policies to reduce prices by reducing aggregate demand. Devaluation can restore competitiveness without reducing aggregate demand.
5. With a decision to devalue the currency, the Central Bank can cut interest rates as it no longer needs to prop up the currency with high interest rates.
Disadvantages of devaluation
1. Inflation. Devaluation is likely to cause inflation because:
* Imports will be more expensive (any imported good or raw material will increase in price)
* Aggregate Demand (AD) increases  causing demand-pull inflation.
* Firms/exporters have less incentive to cut costs because they can rely on the devaluation to improve competitiveness. The concern is in the long-term devaluation may lead to lower productivity because of the decline in incentives.
2. Reduces the purchasing power of citizens abroad. e.g. it is more expensive to go on holiday abroad.
3. Reduced real wages. In a period of low wage growth, a devaluation which causes rising import prices will make many consumers feel worse off. This was an issue in the UK during the period 2007-2018.
4. A large and rapid devaluation may scare off international investors. It makes investors less willing to hold government debt because the devaluation is effectively reducing the real value of their holdings. In some cases, rapid devaluation can trigger capital flight.
5. If consumers have debts, e.g. mortgages in foreign currency  after a devaluation, they will see a sharp rise in the cost of their debt repayments. This occurred in Hungary when many had taken out a mortgage in foreign currency and after the devaluation, it became very expensive to pay off Euro denominated mortgages.
Evaluation of the impact of the devaluation
* It depends on the state of the business cycle  In a recession a devaluation can help boost growth without causing inflation. In a boom, a devaluation is more likely to cause inflation.
* The elasticity of demand. A devaluation may take a while to improve the current account because demand is inelastic in the short term. However, if demand is price elastic, then it will cause a relatively bigger increase in demand for exports. (See: J-Curve effect)
* If the country has lost competitiveness in a fixed exchange rate, a devaluation could be beneficial in solving that decline in competitiveness.
* Type of economy. A developing economy which relies on the import of raw materials may experience serious costs from a devaluation which makes basic goods and food more expensive.

Protecting the marine environment
Professor Atsuko Kanehara, Faculty of Law Sophia University in Japan was in Sri Lanka recently to deliver a special guest lecture on Japans Ocean Policy in the context of the Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy. She was the keynote speaker at the guest lecture and panel discussion on maritime security organised by the Department of International Relations, the University of Colombo in collaboration with the Japanese embassy. Professor Kanehara serves as the Councillor of the Advisory Council for the National Headquarters for Ocean Policy of Japan appointed by the Prime Minister of Japan. She was the chairperson of the subcommittee on maritime security under the Advisory Council in the year 2017. Professor Kanehara also is the Councillor of the Japanese Society of International Law (JSIL) as well as the International Law Association (ILA) Japan branch. She is also a member of Board of Governors of UN IMO International Maritime Law Institute
Professor Atsuko Kanehara
In an exclusive interview with the Daily News, Professor Kanehara expressed her views about the purpose of her visit, the importance of promoting the Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy, adoption of the Third Basic Plan on Japans Ocean policy, sharing knowledge and experiences with Sri Lanka, maritime security and harnessing the power of the Ocean.
Excerpts of the Interview:
Q: What is the purpose of your visit Your thoughts on the reaction of the audience to your guest lecture at Colombo University
A: I was invited to deliver a lecture on the Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy and Japans maritime policy at the Colombo University. There were so many students and academics beyond my expectations. There were a number of professors and diplomats too. There were many questions I had to answer. The most interesting thing was the number of questions and the high concern of the audience about China. When I delivered similar lectures in India and in Bangladesh recently, there were questions about China and Japans relationship with China. But in Sri Lanka, the concern was higher than in those two countries. Maybe it is because Sri Lanka is situated close to the South China Sea. I think that is the reason why Sri Lankan people and academics have a high concern about China. As a whole, I was impressed by the way the audience understood my presentation. It was a very satisfying experience.
Q: Can you briefly explain Japans Basic Act on Ocean Policy, its background and purpose
A: The enactment of the Basic Act on Ocean Policy took place in 2007. The aim was to find answers to a whole host of ocean-related issues that were coming to the fore at the time. The ocean was playing an increasingly important role in securing food, resources and energy, transportation, environmental protection and security among others. The Basic Act on Ocean Policy outlined guiding principles on ocean-related matters and set out the foundations for ocean policy, including the formulation of the Basic Plan on Ocean Policy. It also advocated the establishment of the Headquarters for Ocean Policy, headed by the Prime Minister, with the aim of comprehensively and systematically addressing ocean policy across all relevant government ministries and agencies. Before this act came to be in Japan there was no proper distribution of power among various ministries and agencies when it came to dealing issues related to the Ocean. But with this act, we tried to integrate and synthesize Japanese ocean policy among ministries and agencies.
The goal is to develop in a parallel manner, the integrative system with the Headquarter, on the one hand, and the individual system with the distribution of power among ministries and agencies, on the other hand. After the establishment of the Headquarters, an Advisory Council for the Headquarters was also formulated. Every two years councillors are appointed by the Prime Minister and I have served as councillor since 2016. These institutional developments and the legislative development tried to integrate and synthesize Japanese ocean policy. Earlier ocean policies were taken by each ministry and agencies, individually and separately. The basic plan was enacted in 2008. It should be renewed and updated every five years. So this year (2018) the Third Basic Plan was enacted.
Q: The second basic plan on Ocean policy I am told, focused on establishing Japan as a maritime country, including International cooperation and contribution to the international community, based on the philosophy, From a country protected by the Ocean to a country that protects the Ocean. What is the most prominent feature in the Third Basic Plan
A: The second Basic Plan on Ocean Policy was formulated in 2013. It set out a number of priorities aimed at establishing Japan as a maritime country, including International cooperation and contribution to the international community, Wealth and prosperity through ocean development and utilization of the sea.
However, in the third basic plan, the main pillar is comprehensive maritime security. In the act as well as the first and second basic plan maritime security was there but in a sporadic manner. But in the third basic plan maritime security is the main pillar. After the World War II, devastation, especially my parents generation was very sensitive to issues such as further militarization, national interests, security etc.
I feel that Japanese government until now has not dealt with military or the security issue in a comprehensive manner. So in the third basic plan of the ocean policy, it was the first time for the Japanese government to openly discuss security.
The salient point is maritime security has been explained in the third basic plan very widely and very broadly.
Not only the defence issues but also the law enforcement, disaster relief, managing resources, environmental destruction, illegal migration and smuggling, fishing etc. are broadly and widely explained under the subject of comprehensive maritime security.
In brief, we have tried to encompass maritime security on a broader scale while emphasizing that proactive measures have to be taken to guarantee safety and peace of mind for the people of Japan and safeguard the countrys marine interests.
Q: In post-war Sri Lanka more than the security concerns, Ocean is viewed as a resource for food, promoting tourism etc. Do you think a comprehensive Ocean policy similar to that of Japan will help Sri Lanka to harness the power of the Ocean in a more beneficial manner
A: Of course for Japan the food and natural resources are related to ocean policies. Japan has very little natural resources and Japan heavily depends on imports. So in that sense ocean policies should include policies for harnessing oceans resources. Also, Japan is a country surrounded by sea in all directions and in that sense Japan is similar to Sri Lanka. But in addition tourism too is important to your country and Sri Lanka too is a maritime nation.
Japan was in a similar situation where there was no proper coordination between institutions engaged in handling matters related to the ocean. As I mentioned earlier in 2007 the basic act was enacted and since then integration and synthetization of ocean policies among ministries and agencies have gathered pace.
It is showing very encouraging results. In your country too I believe it is preferable to have a system which integrates and synthesize different ministries and agencies in ocean policies.
However, Sri Lanka in this regard should identify their own priorities and aims. Maybe Sri Lanka too could have one institution like the headquarters in Japan to coordinate issues related to the Ocean. Unity is a powerful tool for success.
Q: Is Japan concerned about the growing influence of China in the Indian Ocean region
A: Japan is aware of Chinas growing influence in the Indian Ocean. But the more important matter for Japan is what is happening in the East and the South China Sea. Japan believes a free and open maritime order based on the rule of law is a cornerstone for peace and prosperity in the international community.
Q: What are your thoughts on current relations between Japan and Sri Lanka
A: The two countries have enjoyed excellent relations since ancient times. I think these are on the up viewing by the bilateral visits, cooperation and exchanges between the two nations.
Between Sri Lanka and Japan, there have been many cooperation on human resources development, law enforcement, disaster relief, counter-terrorism, fisheries sector and post-conflict reconstruction among others. I believe there is space for further growth.

Assassination plot against President, former Defence Secretary
Ranil, Fonseka gave instructions, alleges Namal Kumara
In a special media conference held yesterday (27), Anti-Corruption Force Operations Director Nalaka Kumara alleged that former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and former Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka are behind giving instructions to the assassination plot against President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. According to Kumara, DIG Nalaka Silva received instructions from Wickremesinghe and Fonseka to use Makandure Madush in the assassination plot.
Kumara requested President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa to offer a general amnesty to DIG Nalaka Silva after deriving evidence from him as to who the masterminds behind the assassination plot against the President.
Kumara pointed out that he does not have evidence against the accused, but said that he is revealing what he knows.
I did not speak a word of this even when I was at the CID. If I did, they would have asked for evidence. Everyone starts to ask for evidence. This is the sorry situation now in this country. When someone makes a revelation, they ask for evidence from us. Instead, they should be looking for evidence. Due to this very reason, a number of crimes go unsolved, Kumara pointed out.
Kumara made these observances at a press brief was held at his residence in Ampara, Mahaoya, Samagipura.
Kumara appeared for the press brief accompanied by his father and mother.
I am here to divulge an unsaid story of the assassination plot against the President and the former Defence Secretary. At the press conference, I held on October 24, I mentioned that I know of Sarath Fonseka being behind this assassination plot. I also requested the President to give me a chance to meet him privately for ten minutes. I told the media, that there are other parties involved in this plot. I said that I will speak of those, if the President wants me to speak. I also requested to meet the President for ten minutes. Why did I make such an attempt Now that proper proper background has been created, I can tell the whole country what I was going to tell the President privately, Kumara said.
I wanted to meet the President to tell him that it was Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who gave instructions to DIG Nalaka Silva about using Makadure Madush in this plot. I know this for a fact. I didnt have a chance to tell this earlier. If I said this, nothing would have come out of it since both law and justice were backing them. I dont have evidence to prove this. I asked for ten minutes from the President to tell what I know. But now, I can tell this to the whole country. I dont have to tell you what would have happened if I told this earlier. Now I know he is not in a position to attack me. Now I have no problem. I have said everything that was on my mind, Kumara further said.
Speaking further, Kumara observed that DIG Nalaka Silva was not involved in this assassination plot for personal reasons and pointed out that he was only a pawn in the game.
Remember this, when Nalaka Silva designed this plot and contacted Makadure Madush for this plot, he didnt do it for personal reasons. In my personal view, it is alright to give a general amnesty to Nalaka Silva if he can reveal as to who are really behind this assassination plot. After getting this evidence from Silva, I request the President, as a leader who promotes non-violence, and the Prime Minister to grant a general amnesty to Nalaka Silva after finding out as to who were behind designing this plot and bring those people to justice. I have nothing personal against Silva and have no intention of taking revenge against him, Kumara also said.

Reimagining oedipus
When I open the fridge my laptop is in there; the phone, the television remote. You shout for me in the middle of the night and when I come running you ask what Im doing there. You are not Gretel, you say. My daughter Gretel was wild and beautiful. You are not her.
Writes the heroine of Daisy Johnsons debut novel, Everything Under - Shortlisted for the Man Booker, 2018. (In spite of being the bestselling book on the shortlist and the odds in Johnsons favor the prize went to Anna Burnss Milkman).
It is natural if you feel skeptical when you read the blurb on the cover, written by author Celeste Ng because you would probably have read elsewhere that the story is a retelling of Oedipus Rex and you already know Oedipus is tragic but not too scary. As you turn the pages and step deeper and deeper into the story, however, some of your doubts will vanish like broken wine glasses in the dark and then are gone. True to Ngs words, this is a book  Weird and Wild and Wonderfully Unsettling.
Weird Undeniably. Wild Definitely. Unsettling Yes, a million times over. But, Wonderful I am not so sure. Especially if you go to bed with Everything Under on a stormy night such as the ones we are going through right now, with thunder and lightning and heavy winds thrashing on your window panes. If you hear strange noises outside, close your eyes and cover your head with a pillow. For all you know it might be Bonak trying to get in.
Bonak the monster. No, he is not in Sophocless Oedipus. Nor is there such a word in the Oxford English Dictionary or in any other English Dictionary for that matter. Nor would you have ever heard any of the following words either: harpidoodle, sheesh, duvduv, effie... You wouldnt know them because these are words Daisy Johnson invents for her characters - an attribute praised by Booker Prize Chair of judges, Kwame Appiah as a miracle of stylistic invention.
The protagonist of Everything Under is Gretel whose childhood is spent with her mother Sarah in an engine-less houseboat moored in a quiet part of the River Thames, sharing a private world defined by a vocabulary known only to the two of them. Not surprisingly Gretel grows up to become a lexicographer, and ends up spending her days alone, examining the various meanings for real words like break and dread. When the story begins, Gretel is coaxing Sarah into telling her life story  an endeavor made tougher by Sarahs dementia  vividly described in the opening pages as seen above.
If you feel Gretels relationship with her mother is unsettling wait till you read more, wait till Gretel comes across an old acquaintance, Marcus, who (as told in another thread, from his point of view) spent part of his youth on the boat with Gretel and Sarah, after committing murder while in the grip of a nightmare. If this is not enough to spin you around, you will soon learn Marcus was, to begin with, Margot. In other words there are no fixed categories of man or woman in this book. As the New Yorker pointed out, in Johnsons hands, masculine and feminine signifier slide around like raindrops on a pane of glass.
In such a setting its natural that Oedipus is not really Oedipus. Johnson transforms Oedipus into the girl Gretel who lives in modern Britain. In this new version of the Greek tragedy Johnson explores questions of fate and free will, gender fluidity, and fractured family relationships. She also focuses on womanhood as a trap.
There is no escaping... the way we will end up is coded into us from the moment we are born, Sarah tells Gretel. Any decisions we make are only mirages,ghosts to convince us of free will.
Johnson who became the youngest author ever to make the Man Booker prize shortlist, talking about the importance of classical mythology in a modern-day setting and the current trend for classical Greek literature to be re-written from a womans point of view says, This year has been a good one for retellings; theyre everywhere.
I think retellings have the power to talk about the world we live in from a different angle, to trick the reader into seeing through a lens. The classics often speak about universal things that affect us all. There is something, also, about the orality of them which I think speaks to writers.
When the New Statement asked her (before the Man Booker 2018 winner was announced), Are we all doomed she had this to say. Of course.
Even if we dont die from global warming or a nuclear event we are fast moving away from any sort of happiness that will enable us to exist without feeling we are living doomed lives.
This may not be the perfect way to begin your Monday. But lets look at the bright side. Somewhere out there Sophocles must be smiling.

Inaugurated in 1999, this is the only wind power project that the CEB owned.
He said that of five wind power towers, only three are functioning.
The CEB had decided to remove the wind power plant taking into account the expenditure it costs.
The CEB has called for tenders to remove the wind power towers and evaluated the proposals received and the most eligible company will be entrusted to remove the plant, he said.

SL to obtain Rs 310 bn loan for  Active Liability Management
The Parliament passed the resolution to raise Rs. 310 billion by way of loans in or outside Sri Lanka for Active Liability Management by the Government of Sri Lanka.
The Parliament on October 26 resolved under section 3 of the Active Liability Management Act of 2018 (ALMA) that a sum not exceeding Rs. 310 billion may be raised by the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) by way of loans, in or outside Sri Lanka for such purposes as specified in the provisions of the Active Liability Management Act No 8 of 2018.
The GOSL is fully cognizant of its outstanding debt liabilities denominated in foreign and local currencies. In view of the necessity for institutionalizing a legal framework for managing the countrys public debt profile in a prudent manner that brings debt sustainability and macroeconomic stability amidst potential impact of exogenous and endogenous shocks, the Parliament enacted the ALMA in March 2018.
The ALMA provides the legal framework for GOSL to raise loans in or outside Sri Lanka for management of public debt in terms of relevant laws, including the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949, the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance (Chapter 417), Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance (Chapter 420), and the Foreign Loan Act No. 29 of 1957. 2
The Active Liability Management framework of GOSL is focused on acting in advance, to re-finance and/ or pre-finance debt repayable beyond the financial year covered under the Annual Appropriation Act.
The Liability Management Strategy of GOSL is planned to be implemented to ease the repayment of debt in the future and ensure that such repayments are done at the lowest possible cost in line with the Governments cash flow, prevailing and expected interest rates and the future maturities of public debt.

Stress in middle age can make your brain shrink and make your memory worse
Stress in middle age can make your brain shrink and make your memory worse, scientists have discovered. The brain-reducing effects of stress, identified in people in their 40s free from dementia, were found to be triggered by cortisol.
The high levels of the stress hormone may be an early warning sign someone may end up with dementia, the research suggests.
Stress also made people's thinking skills worse, the Harvard Medical School study, published in the journal Neurology, found.
For the research, scientists led by Dr Justin Echouffo-Tcheugui studied 2,231 people with an average age of 49 and free of dementia.
He said: 'Our research detected memory loss and brain shrinkage in middle-aged people before symptoms started to show.
'So it's important for people to find ways to reduce stress, such as getting enough sleep, engaging in moderate exercise, incorporating relaxation techniques into their daily lives, or asking their doctor about their cortisol levels and taking a cortisol-reducing medication if needed.'
He added: 'It's important for physicians to counsel all people with higher cortisol levels.'
At the start of the study, each participant did tests on their memory and thinking skills. Then eight years later they repeated the exercises.
A subset of the group, 2,018 people, also had an MRI brain scan to measure the volume of their brain.
Once the results were adjusted for age, sex, smoking and body mass, researchers found lower scores on tests of memory and thinking in people with higher levels of cortisol than those with average levels.
In addition, people with higher cortisol levels had a smaller brain volume, with those with high cortisol having brains that were 88.5 per cent of the total cranial volume.
This was compared to 88.7 per cent of total cranial volume for people with normal levels of the hormone.
No links were found between low levels of cortisol and brain size. Cortisol, produced by the adrenal glands, helps the body respond to stress.
It can also help reduce inflammation, control blood sugar and blood pressure, regulate metabolism and help with immune response.
High cortisol levels can be caused by stress, medical conditions or medications.
Dr Echouffo-Tcheugui said: Cortisol affects many different functions so it is important to fully investigate how high levels of the hormone may affect the brain. -Daily Mail

Synagogue shooter charged with murder
US: A man suspected of killing 11 people in a synagogue in Pittsburgh has been charged with murder - in what is believed to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in recent US history.
Robert Bowers, 46, is accused of opening fire at the Tree of Life synagogue during its Sabbath service.
He faces 29 criminal counts, including use of a firearm to commit murder.
Federal prosecutors say they will also file hate crime charges, and the suspect could face the death penalty.
President Donald Trump described the attack as a wicked act of mass murder.
Six people - including four police officers - were injured in Saturdays attack. The suspect was also wounded in a shootout with police. Hundreds of people - from the neighbourhood and also all across Pittsburgh - later gathered for an interfaith vigil for the victims of the attack in the synagogue in Squirrel Hill.
Sophia Levin, a local resident and one of the organisers, told the BBC people wanted to be together, not alone, and the vigil would help heal the city.
President Trump said he would visit Pittsburgh soon. He also ordered US flags at government buildings to be flown at half-mast until October 31.
On Saturday morning, worshippers had gathered at the synagogue for a baby naming ceremony during the Sabbath.
Squirrel Hill has one of the largest Jewish populations in Pennsylvania and this would have been the synagogues busiest day of the week.
According to reports,Bowers, a white male, entered the building during the morning service armed with an assault rifle and three handguns.
The gunman had already shot dead 11 people and was leaving the synagogue after about 20 minutes when he encountered Swat officers and exchanged fire with them, FBI agent Robert Jones said.
The attacker then moved back into the building to try to hide from the police.
He surrendered after a shootout, and is now being treated in hospital for what has been described as multiple gunshot wounds.
The crime scene was horrific, Pittsburghs Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich told reporters. One of the worst Ive seen, and Ive [worked] on some plane crashes. Its very bad.
Hissrich said no children were among the casualties. What do we know about the gunman US media said he had shouted All Jews must die as he carried out the attack.
Social media posts by someone with the name Robert Bowers were also reported to be full of anti-Semitic comments.
FBI special agent Bob Jones told a press conference that Bowers did not appear to be known to authorities prior to the attack.
He said that any motive remains unknown but that authorities believe he was acting alone. - BBC

The United Nations celebrates (UN) its 73rd anniversary, marking the founding of its Charter which enshrines the UNs commitment to the people on Human Rights, Peace and Security, and Development.
Over the past 63 years of partnership with Sri Lanka, this commitment remains strong, as the UN continues to work to achieve the countrys priorities. The 2030 agenda, including the 17 Sustainable Development Goals means that everyone, including the youngest and most vulnerable, are taken into account in our shared journey ahead.
Inclusive development can be achieved when everyone is heard, including youth, and it is vital that they are given the opportunity to lead and create a sustainable Sri Lanka. Today there are 1.8 billion people between the ages of 10 to 24, making this generation of young people the largest in world history.
In Sri Lanka, the youth comprises nearly a quarter of the population. The UN encourages them to be changemakers and partners in achieving these goals.
Recognizing the tremendous potential of young people, the UN together with the Education Ministry launched the Sustainable Development Goals Action Campaign, aimed at supporting student-led initiatives towards achieving these goals.
The campaign continues this year, with UN Day being celebrated with schoolchildren from all parts of Sri Lanka in a special assembly. The UN, working towards equality, human rights and human dignity, is committed to doing things differently to support and invest in development, climate action, peacebuilding, policy and innovation to ensure that none is left behind.
The UN in Sri Lanka is guided by the overarching United Nations Sustainable Development Framework 2018-2022 and will continue to support the government to achieve peaceful, just, inclusive and equitable development.

Gross domestic product increased at a 3.5 per cent annualised rate also supported by a surge in inventory investment and solid government spending, the Commerce Department said on Friday (Oct 26) in its first estimate of third-quarter GDP growth.
While that was a slowdown from a 4.2 per cent pace in the second quarter, it still exceeded the economys growth potential, which economists put at about two per cent. But there were red flags to the economic expansion that is now in its ninth year and the second longest on record.
Business spending stalled and residential investment declined for a third straight quarter, signs that the boost from a US$1.5 trillion tax cut was fading and higher interest rates were hurting the housing market.
There will come a day of reckoning for the economy after the tax cut monies are all gone, but for today Washington really has something to crow about, said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.

World Bank buy-back project, money spinner for farmers
Agriculture has always been a paradox in Sri Lanka. According to World Bank Statistics in 2016, 81.59 percent, the majority population, live in rural areas. But only 27 percent (2017), just over a quarter of the Sri Lankan population is engaged in agriculture and the sector only contributes 6.9 percent to the GDP of the country. If you live in a rural area, the potential of your engaging in some sort of agriculture is high, and yet, more and more are moving away from it. Why The answer to this is simple: money.
According to the Agriculture Sector Modernization Project  a World Bank funded project under the Agriculture Ministry  an average farmer earns around Rs. 30,000 per month. The work a farmer puts into earning this paltry sum is back-breaking, the weather may be unkind, and the debts taken out for each season eat into any profit made.
Thus the five-year World Bankfunded project costing US$ 169.84 million working together with the Primary Industries Ministry and Agriculture Ministry (US$ 58.63 million) has sought to solve these issues by connecting farmers with technology and markets.
Project Director Thulani Weerakoon brought into the Agriculture Ministry to accelerate the programme which was signed in 2016 but lay dormant until last year has a Masters in Project Management and a Bachelors in Economics. With no agriculture background, she has managed to stir the project into action. Her progress thus far has been captured in the success of their pickled green cucumber pilot project launched in war-torn Vakarai in the Eastern Province.
Cucumbers to the rescue
This was an area where they had not engaged in any agriculture for a long time. In addition, it is a water- scarce region and there wasnt a reliable supply of electricity, said Weerakoon.
In May of this year, the project signed an agreement with Hayleys PLC for 500 farmers (starting with 70) to grow green cucumbers under a buy-back system. A project office set up at the location ensured that the farmers chosen with the assistance of the area Agriculture Instructor, based on 20 criteria, were given all the necessary support to make it a success. This included a grant of Rs. 400,000 to each farmer which included a diesel water pump, post-harvest equipment such as crates and sprinkler facilities for an acre which could be expanded later. The water pumps were designed to be able to be used for four to five acres. Thus farmers who wanted to grow more than an acre were helped in securing a Bank of Ceylon loan to expand the sprinkler facilities to cover a larger area.
This is given to them based on the money they earn through the project, so costs could be covered. We calculate the Return of Investment (ROI) based on the grant. Three to four years down the line, they have to replace the equipment and should have enough money on their own for that.
In addition, the farmers were also given soft skills training such as entrepreneurial and farmer business school training and technical training and training in other capacity-building courses.
In a matter of two months, the harvests were in and Weerakoon reported that farmers earned between Rs. 250,000  Rs. 300,000 in that one season. You need two months to grow it and one month to harvest. So a farmer can grow three seasons in a year.
With the buy-back programme in place, Hayleys purchased the cucumber at Rs. 27 per kilo and given that the cucumbers were being used for pickles, even damaged cucumbers were bought.
Every project has to be connected with a buyer; that is how you get a guaranteed buyer. And in our agreements between the company and the farmer, we look at what the company gives and what the farmer gives. Here, the farmer contributes, seed, fertilizer, land and labour and the company provides a guaranteed price, on ground technical support.
Hayleys, Weerakoon explained, also helped the farmer go through the banking system and take loans at an interest rate of 6.5 percent, so that they had the money to purchase the seeds and fertilizer sold by the company to the farmer.
The cucumber project which cost a total of Rs 200 million, has been worked out as a 60:40 percent partnership between the government and the farmer.
Hayleys which supplies the pickled cucumber to international food franchises has now decided to put up a warehouse in Vakarai to accommodate an expansion of the project after its initial success. The company is also planning to build a Rs. 400 million factory to process the cucumbers in Vakarai itself.
Building clusters
The World Bank in its overview of the project states that the main objective of it is to support increasing agriculture productivity, improving market access and enhancing value addition of smallholder farmers and agribusinesses in the project areas.
It proposes to achieve this through three main components: (1) Agriculture Value Chain Development (export-oriented agriculture and agri-businesses with financial support); (2) Productivity Enhancement and Diversification Demonstrations (modern agriculture technology parks and farmer training); and (3)
Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (Primary Industries and Agriculture Ministries to coordinate activities, procurement and social and environmental safeguards)
In keeping with the above requirements, the project was designed to form two or three clusters of high value fruits and vegetables in the districts of Batticaloa, Mullaitivu, Jaffna, Moneragala, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Matale. European Union funding slated for next year is expected to expand the project to Badulla, Ampara, Killinochchi and Vavuniya.
Clusters have to be at a certain location so that we can also provide all the other services. The warehouse, laboratory  we want to provide all the necessary things for the crop to succeed.
Overall, it aims to benefit 14,000 farmers directly and 30,000 farmers indirectly and at present 20 pilot projects similar to that in Vakarai are running with around 100200 farmers in each. In Jaffna, Matale and Moneragala mango clusters have been initiated, whilst Moneragala has also been given a pineapple cluster. Mullaitivu has a cluster of cashew, Anuradhapura  bitter gourd and Polonnaruwa  mushrooms, among many others.
Weerakoon explained that they chose projects based on their suitability for each district and more importantly, whether they would be able to churn out a net profit of at least Rs. 60,000 (double the average) per month. The project is about the market. We look at the market and if we have a market, we fund the project. That is how we have designed the pilot projects.
Value addition and markets
One of the most significant aspects of the project has been the emphasis on value addition and matching the product to a long-term buyer with international linkages for export.
When it came to cucumber, Weerakoons team had insisted that the farmers not just grow cucumbers but grow it for a specific purpose. Similarly, they have been asked by Ceylon Biscuits Limited whether a project could grow organic papaya. We know that they are established and need this for one of their products. So to grow produce for a readymade product is easier. We ask the private sector what they need, and work backwards, and see if the farmer can get at least Rs. 60,000.
Pricing backwards, Weerakoon said, is the safest way and it ensured the farmers a long-term market. Though there have been questions about the fixed prices determined by the buy-back agreements with the companies, Weerakoon said this was more stable for a farmer, rather than depending on a constantly fluctuating open market.
From the mango to cucumber, each project has had to be customised to suit local needs
Working out the details
At present, however, the projects are in their pilot phase and to formally launch it, Weerakoon and her team have to first procure an international consultant to design the clusters.
The agreement with the World Bank states that we need to get an international consultant to design clusters. We are still in the process of procuring a consultant, and because of the delay, we started pilot projects. We plan to have the consultant by the end of November. He is coming to develop, design and implement the whole project.
When asked why a foreign consultant was specified, she explained that the consultant would help in securing new technology from overseas for the project and bring in a new look to the agricultural system as stated in the agreement.
In the meantime, Weerakoon has had to be resourceful to get the government machinery moving at a faster pace than usual. Having hired the former Director General of the Agriculture Department, Dr Rohan Wijekoon, she had been successful building an active relationship within the various departments in the Ministry and Department.
I have also hired many personnel from the Finance Ministry to help me out with the procurements. At present, we have 180 procurement activities worth Rs. 2,500 million, as each pilot project is unique and complex; a normal road project will just have 10 procurements.
They have also asked the Agriculture Insurance Board to provide their farmers with a crop insurance scheme where the farmer also contributes to it. Agri-businesses are very risky so insurance comes up at a premium and no insurance company wants to touch it.
Funds from the project have also been used to conduct research studies on value addition for vegetables and fruits for studies on how to improve yields of native fruits and vegetables.
The project, in addition, also insists that all pilot projects employ 40 percent women and attract more youth into farming, We hope that the introduction of technology which would cut down on heavy labour would attract more youth.
For example, the project provided small thrashers to groundnut farmers which cut down production costs in half. In Jaffna, the mango farmers were given pruning kits and trained pruners to save labour costs. In both these cases, costs were also brought down by having machinery shared within farmer organizations.
We buy one tractor which is given to a cluster and the farmer pays for the number of hours the tractor was used. When it comes to the mango trees, we give the pruning kit to the farmer organisation, we train the pruner, and the pruners go from field to field and get a sum for doing it. Not all trees pruned at the same time, so two or three kits should be enough.
Despite these successes however, Weerakoon is aware that they would have to continuously innovate and adapt to keep the momentum going.
In the next three to four years, cucumbers in Vakarai will not as successful as soil conditions change, she observed, and thus the team is already studying the option of replacing it with Jalapeno chilli.
This is agriculture. Nothing is static so we too have to adapt, she said.

World Without Waste
Sustaining the momentum of its Give Back Life PET plastic recycling campaign from the recently launched Colombo - Katunayake Expressway project in partnership with the Road Development Authority, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd, has joined hands with Perera & Sons and recycling partner Eco Spindles. Give Back Life PET collection bins have been placed at the Perera & Sons Havelock Town and Dambulla outlets, while also supporting the waste segregation yard located at Pita Kotte, initiated by Perera & Sons.
This end-to-end partnership between the three entities is aligned to Coca-Colas pledge to work with a host of partners in the coming years to deliver its World Without Waste packaging vision, which includes collecting and recycling a bottle or can for everyone it sells globally by 2030 and its renewed focus on the entire packaging lifecycle. Coca-Cola is entering into such impactful partnerships and through the presence of conveniently located PET plastic collection bins spread the message to people - to hold onto their litter to be till it can be disposed appropriately for recycling, thereby generating an income and supporting the creation of new livelihoods.
This new value chain in Sri Lanka benefits not alone the environment but supports new livelihoods, industries and communities. All the collected PET bottles will be recycled by Eco Spindles to produce yarn, brushes, etc., thus utilising the maximum value of PET.
Commenting on this initiative, Executive Director, Perera & Sons Kamal Jaimon said, We are pleased to launch this partnership with Coca-Cola and Eco Spindles which is beneficial for the environment, while encouraging customers at our Havelock Town and Dambulla outlets to dispose PET plastic packaging responsibly into the Give Back Life bins, which we display proudly.
Coca-Colas vision is very much in line with Perera & Sons as since 2017 we began PET plastic recycling and these were the initial steps in our journey to todays waste segregation yard at our Pita Kotte branch.

World's oldest shipwreck
An ancient Greek trading ship dating back more than 2,400 years has been found virtually intact at the bottom of the Black Sea, the world's oldest known shipwreck, researchers said recently.
The vessel is one of more than 60 shipwrecks identified by the Black Sea Maritime Archaeology Project including Roman ships and a 17th-century Cossack raiding fleet. During the three-year project, researchers used specialist remote deep-water camera systems previously used in offshore oil and gas exploration to map the sea floor.
"A small piece of the vessel has been carbon dated and it is confirmed as the oldest intact shipwreck known to mankind," the project said in a statement.
The ship, which is lying on its side with its mast and rudders intact, was dated back to 400 BC - a time when the Black Sea was a trading hub filled with Greek colonies.
The team said the vessel, previously only seen in an intact state on the side of ancient Greek pottery, was found at a depth of more than 2,000 metres (6,500 feet). The water at that depth is oxygen-free, meaning that organic material can be preserved for thousands of years.
"A ship, surviving intact, from the Classical world, lying in over two kilometres of water, is something I would never have believed possible," said Professor Jon Adams from the University of Southampton in southern England, the project's main investigator.
"This will change our understanding of shipbuilding and seafaring in the ancient world," he said. Helen Farr, a project team member, said, "We have bits of shipwreck which are earlier but this one really looks intact. The project as a whole was actually looking at sea level change and the flooding of the Black Sea region... and the shipwrecks are a happy by-product of that. -AFP

President Maithripala Sirisenas address to the nation yesterday
I will always fulfill peoples expectations
I have decided to address the nation today in the context of the recent political developments in the country. I thought it was essential to clarify the path we have to take in the future and to describe the reasons and the background why the current political change was necessary. Today we are at the dawn of another year. On January 8, 2015, it was with so many expectations what nearly six million and two hundred thousand (6.25 million) people of my country chose me as their first servant and the leader of this nation. I wish to pledge that I will always fulfill the expectations and honour, the trust and faith you have placed on me even at the cost of my life.
Politicians like us who are committed to serve the people should always look at what is right for the people and will usher prosperity to the nation, instead of ones political affiliations. I believe that you remember the circumstances under which I became the common candidate in 2014 and the dangers I had to face in consequence. It was a risk and a challenge that no politician in the history of the country wanted to accept. I faced this challenge despite the dangers to me and my family. I hope you will believe that the decision I made on October 26, 2018, is a decision that is far more challenging and risky than the decision I made on November 21, 2014. I must state with respect, honour, and humility that I took both those decisions for the sake of the people and the country. However, Ranil Wickremesinghes political conduct was unbecoming of civilized politics and belittled the victory achieved risking my life in 2015. I believe that Wickremesinghe and his group of closest friends who belonged to a privileged class and did not understand the pulse of the people conducted themselves as if shaping the future of the country was a fun game they played. I feel that Wickremesinghe grossly violated the very principles of good governance we pledged to uphold.
Noble expectations
I am sure you remember that on the evening of January 9t, 2015, moments after taking oaths as President, I appointed Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka although he had only 47 members in Parliament. However, I am sure you know that Wickremesinghe destroyed the concept and the noble expectations of good governance by his actions during the last few years. Corruption and fraud spread widely in the country. Thereby, he destroyed the pure and noble expectations of the 49 political parties, organisations, trade unions, and civil society groups including the UNP, who signed an agreement in support of the common candidate. I hope you remember a statement I made recently at a Senanayake commemoration event. The political visions of great leaders such as D.S. Senanayake, Dudley Senanayake, J.R. Jayewardene, and Ranasinghe Premadasa made the UNP a mighty political party, enriched with indigenous thinking and our cultural heritage. They stood for the national identity and territorial integrity of the country. They were committed to protect everything what could be called ours. It is my sincere hope that the present leadership of the UNP be blessed with the wisdom of those great leaders to embrace a vision with noble objectives that can take our country to the new world.
Once in the government, Wickremesinghe arrogantly and stubbornly avoided collective decisions, and tended to made individual decisions. This behaviour led to many conflicts. Due to his lack of collective decision making through discussion, our country had to face harsh consequences when he used to make decisions with a group of his very close associates. I must state that, there was also a policy conflict between Ranil Wickremesinghe and I, during the last three and half years. Apart from a policy differences, I noted that there were also differences of culture between Wickremesinghe and I. I believe that all those differences in policy, culture, personality and conduct aggravated this political and economic crisis.
When many senior leaders were around, I have suggested to him to work together and work collectively. I suggested to him that we should make our decisions after proper discussion to achieve the goals of good governance. However, he ignored the aspirations of over six million and two hundred thousand people. I am very worried about that. I accepted the leadership of this country to ensure creative governance upholding the principles of good governance and that is free of corruption or fraud. I always tried to bring in past experiences to understand present challenges and build a better tomorrow that in terms of our noble expectations. I committed myself to them fully. However, I had to take a few steps back many times. As you have seen, I had to speak somewhat aggressively from time to time during the last three years. On such occasions, you may have blamed me, called me immature, or getting too aggressive. However, it is my conscience that best knows how much patience and tolerance I have practised in the internal discussions and at Cabinet meetings.
Betrayal
I made all those sacrifices for the sake of the people of Sri Lanka. However, you know how those noble expectations of the people who espoused the concept of good governance were betrayed even before three months elapsed since we were elected.
The robbery of the Central Bank dragged our country into a deep crisis. As you know, we had not heard about such a big fraud of public finances in the history of Sri Lanka. The Central Bank robbery was an abortion of the pledge of good governance we had given to the people to eliminate corruption and fraud. I remember that there came a lot of resistance and protests from people, opposition parties, political groups, civil society and responsible people in the society when the Central Bank robbery was committed. That led to a lot of tensions within the government. At that time, Wickremesinghe behaved very impatiently and restlessly. When I decided to visit the Central Bank and meet the staff of the Bank, I remember, he suddenly came to my residence and asked me, the Central Bank belongs to me, why do you want to go there At that moment, I told him, It is true that it has been gazetted under your purview, but as the President of the country, I have the right to visit that place. I told him that I was planning to go to the Bank in a while anyway. Wirckremesinghe left immediately. When I got there, Arjun Mahendran, who has been sent on leave pending investigation, came to welcome me with a bunch of beetle leaves.
I was surprised to see how he had got there all of a sudden. I saw how disturbed, restless and panicking they were. This shameless robbery led to a serious economic crisis and a political crisis. Then, I appointed a commission to investigate the Central Bank issue in response to peoples demand. When the Commission was carrying on the investigations independently, leaders of the UNP started pointing fingers at me. They asked why I appointed this commission. They considered this move was a disgrace to the UNP. But I assured them that the appointment of the Commission was necessary to clear those who are not involved and to bring to book those who were culprits. As you know, this robbery has dragged our country into deep economic crisis, from which it is difficult to come out.
I believe that the result of the Local Government elections that was held last February was a warning by the people to correct the course of this government. At that moment, I called Wickremesinghe and other leaders of the UNP and explained, People have taught us a lesson about the way we have governed, and we must correct ourselves now.
I told Wickremesinghe, You have acquired my powers to do what you did, and I silently gave you that power in gratitude as you took leadership to bring me to power. As a result of my gratefulness, which is a noble human quality, the country had to suffer very bad consequences. That was because I allowed him to conduct freely, sometime even acquiring my powers. I do not wish to go into a detailed account of the negative consequences of his tenure. I wish to explain those consequences to you from time to time. I would now like to explain the most proximate and powerful reason that made me appoint former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister and remove Ranil Wickremesinghe from the post of Prime Minister.
Conspiracy
My political life is now spans over 51 years. Recently, a person called Namal Kumara came before the media and disclosed about a plot to assassinate me and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. I handed over the task of investigations to the Criminal Investigations Department. However, the Inspector General of Police did not assign the investigations to the CID. Instead it was given to another division. Then I realised that there was an issue of trust about the investigations. Within 48 hours of the disclosure made to the media by Namal Kumara and investigations could be commenced on the plot, the Inspector General of Police stated that there was a doubt about the voices in the tape recording provided by that person. I would like to raise the question, with respect, is it suitable for a police chief to behave in such a shameless manner and express doubts about the recording without seeking any technical expert advice on the tape recording when there was a revelation that a plot was hatched to assassinate the President of the country
The reports provided by the CID and other investigating authorities including the Intelligence Bureau showed that this is a very serious matter. In this plot, there is a wide range of information which has not been disclosed to the public.
There is also an involvement of a Cabinet Minister in this plot to assassinate me. Furthermore, there has been tremendous pressure on investigations. There were instances of some responsible officers of the Attorney Generals Department evading the investigation duties. Under these political problems, economic troubles and the strong plot to assassinate me, the only alternative open to me was to invite former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and appoint him as Prime Minister to form a new government.
I extend an open invitation to all 225 Members of Parliament to join the new government. I do this with the pure intention of taking the country out of the present political crisis and economic problems. Now, the political crisis has been somewhat declined. I appeal to everybody to extend fullest cooperation to the new government formed by me with Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime minister to strengthen democratic governance and freedom of the people, human rights and fundamental rights and media freedom and take our motherland towards prosperity and make a better and decent society.
While referring to past bitter experiences, I wish to reiterate here that Ranil wickremesinghe must take the responsibility to bring Arjuna Mahendran to Sri Lanka and produce him before courts. That is because, as everybody knows, Arjuna Mahendran is a very close friend of Ranil Wickremesinghe. Local industries of the country were weakened in the last few years and for them to recover, the blessings from the government alone are not enough.
Central Bank Bond robbery
In the last few years, the economic policy kept the trust merely on foreign investments and that weakened our local industries. On one side, there were these weaknesses of the economic policy. At the same time, I ask you to examine what has happened to the amendments presented last week to the Commission I appointed to probe Bribery or corruption to bring to book those who are guilty of Central Bank Bond robbery. All those legal experts, Attorney-Generals Department, the members of the Commission on Bribery or Corruption and those who made investigations informed me earlier this year that it would take at least 15 years to punish the perpetrators of Central Bank Bond robbery under the laws in the country.
Legal experts explained that over 15 years will take to prosecute and punish the guilty and recover the money stolen by them. The Commission on Bribery or Corruption and Attorney-Generals Department recommended to make some amendments to the Commission Act, so that the guilty persons could be sentenced in one year and recover the huge amount of money they had stolen. Accordingly, we have drafted the amendments to the Act at the Presidential Secretariat and sent to Parliament six months ago.
However, the amendment was not submitted for five months. It got buried in the Office of the Leader of the House. I made serious inquiries into this. I asked the officials of the Commission on Bribery or Corruption. I asked the officers in the Attorney-Generals Department. Finally, the Amendment Bill to Act on Commission on Bribery or Corruption was presented to Parliament. I am sad to say that Parliament postponed the approval of the Amendments Act indefinitely. Why was it deferred For whose benefit Due to pressure from whom This will result in the country losing a large sum of money that belongs to the people.
It would take 15 to 20 years to mete out punishment to the guilty persons. That is why the Amendments Act was postponed indefinitely. You must have seen in the media about the monetary deal of the EAP company. That company was given to a foreigner. That deal was done fraudulently without calling for tenders. There will be a thorough investigation on this in near future. Many valuable assets were given to foreigners without tenders. Construction awards were also given without tenders. The emergency Cabinet papers were presented to award such tenders and massive construction awards were given despite objections at the Cabinet. One such example is the Kandy Highway Project. Another is the Land Ordinance Special Act, which was presented to the Cabinet last week. Then there was the paper on establishing a land bank. I lodged strong protests and postponed those Cabinet papers. A majority of Cabinet Ministers were against these proposals.
If the last weeks Land Ordinance Special Act was passed by the Cabinet and then by Parliament, all the lands of our Motherland could be bought outright by foreigners without any difficulty. All the agricultural settlements established by leaders like D. S. Senanayake, Bandaranaike and Gamini Dissanayake will be destroyed. This bill presented under the political and economic vision of Ranil Wickremesinghe to adversely affect the land rights of the country must be totally blocked.
National Economic Council
I must also tell you that the committee set up by Ranil Wickremesinghe to manage economy was totally fraudulent. The decisions made by that committee were fraudulent. It was a major challenge to abolish it. As an alternative to that committee, I have established the National Economic Council. Ranil Wickremesinghe has taken everything possible to weaken that Commission. The monthly emoluments for the economic expert, who was appointed the head of the Commission was paid by an international monetary institution respected by all of us. On Wickremesinghes advice, that payment was stopped. Wickremesinghe took steps to prevent the Commission from functioning. I clearly state that this crisis situation has emerged due to Wickremesinghes stubborn decisions.
Because of all these issues, the only alternative I was left with was to establish a new government with Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister.
Ranil Wickremesinghe and the UNP complain that the establishment of a new government and appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister was contradictory to the provisions of the Constitution of Sri Lanka. I categorically state that the appointments were made totally in accordance with the Constitution and on advice of legal experts. No constitutional violation was done when appointments were made and removal was enacted. With all respect, I completely reject the charge that what was done was a violation of the Constitution.
I wish to thank the people of the country, public officials, Police, security forces, the Army, Navy and Air Force and others for the support extended to me by strengthening law and order, strengthening democratic structure and facilitating the day-to-day needs of the people. While concluding the speech, I appeal to UNPers who made a broad commitment to make me President to jointly commit ourselves to achieve that beautiful vision for our Motherland.
I am confident that if a leader with a vision, who values what is local, who understands the common mans feelings, values the vision and policies of the Senanayakes, Jayewardene and Premadasa becomes the leader of your UNP in the future, we will be able to achieve those noble objectives. Finally, I appeal to the Maha Sangha, other religious leaders, politicians, all the public servants, and all the citizens to give your blessings and support to the political decision I have made on behalf of the country and the people to end the economic crisis and political turbulence and build a prosperous economy and a decent, spiritual, enlightened society.

Values eroded in Wickremesinghe era
The behaviour of certain politicians in the country has proved that men who are not nurtured by art and literature can commit any grave crime, said former Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Kumarasiri Hettige.
Hettige who said the entire social order is in a state of unrest today, added that a society of compassionate men and women should he nurtured to overcome this situation.
He was addressing the gathering at the Gee Rasa Dehena musical event at Laksara Grand Resort, Morawaka, on October 23.
Hettige said the former Wickremesinghe government was an era where social, cultural, political, and other values had declined.
When there are unpleasant happenings in the higher echelons of government, such things filtered down to the people at large.
This is a time when the country is headed by people who loved their motherland and the people at large. Music and literature can render a great service to the nation, he said.

Accepted post at a time of deep crisis - PM Mahinda
Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa said he accepted the invitation to take up the post of Prime Minister at a time when the country is in deep crisis because he is always prepared to perform his duties by the country and nation. He said he will confirm the confidence placed on him by saving the country from the crisis situation and steering it on the correct path. Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa gave the assurance before the Malwatte Chief Prelate Most.Ven.Thibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thera and the Asgiriya Chief Prelate Most Ven. Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Mahanayake Thera and members of the Karaka Sangha Sabhas in Kandy and receiving their blessings yesterday (October 28).
Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa who said that he commanded the majority support in Parliament added he would have never accepted the new post without the majority support in Parliament. He said President Maithripala Sirisena has appointed him as Prime Minister in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.
The procedure to be adopted in removing an incumbent Prime Minister and appointing a new Prime Minister in his place in clearly laid down in the Constitution.
On this occasion, President Sirisena had made a grave and important decision. A President would never act in an irresponsible manner in making such an important decision. As such President Sirisena had made the decision with clear understanding and responsibility.
Premier Rajapaksa said President Sirisena had made the decision after firmly establishing that it would gain the support of over 120 Parliamentarians. The person who has the majority support would be proved at the next Parliamentary sitting, Prime Minister Rajapaksa said.
The Prime Minister who said that the MoU between the two parties gets annulled the moment the UPFA withdraws from the National Government added that the Cabinet of Ministers too stands abolished the movement that happened.
As such his appointment as the new Prime Minister was legal and in keeping with the provisions, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa said, when he was the President, he relinquished all posts and left for his residence after handing over Temple Trees and all other privileges even before the announcement of the final election results. But there were no sings of Ranil leaving Temple Trees. It was regrettable to see Ranil Wickremesinghe insisting to be the Prime Minister when a new Prime Minister has been appointed according to the Constitution.
When the economy was cashing on one side the former government went on a spree selling all local resources to foreign countries, the Premier said.
Parliamentrian Keheliya Rambukwella, Lohan Ratwatte, Dilum Amunugama, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Pavithra Wanni Arachchi, Anrradha Jayaratne and Lakshman Vasantha were also present on the occasion.

ADB to donate US$ 200 mn for ESDFP
The Education Sector Development Program (ESDP) of the Ministry of Education which commenced in 2013 and implemented through the nine provincial education departments, Department of Education Publications and Department of Examinations is the first Result Based Lending (RBL) program by the Asian Development Bank in Sri Lanka.
Under the program costing US$ 200 million it was intended to introduce the Technology stream for GCE A/L, upgrade 250 1C schools (to include at least one school per Divisional Secretaries division) in the island were to be upgraded to 1AB (schools offering all streams for GCE A/L) status, develop teacher training, improve leadership and strengthen school management as well as introduce performance based financing to provinces.

Figures provided by the Ministry of Education also showed that there was an increase in the number of students who opted to follow the Technology stream for the GCE Advance Level. In 2015 when technology was introduced only 13,452 students had taken the challenge of following the new stream while 18800 students had enrolled in 2017.
Students who select technology have the choice of either following Engineering Technology (ET) or Bio System Technology (BST) and offer Engineering Technology, Information & Communication Technology (ICT), Science for Technology (ST) and Bio Science Technology (BST) as subjects for the Advanced Level examination. At present 25% of the marks is for practical projects and it would be increased to 40% in the future, said Rathnayaka Karunasiri, Program Head of the ESDP.
We would have had to face many problems if the Asian Development Bank did not support the initiative to introduce technology for the GCE Advanced Level, said Sunil Hettiarachchi, Secretary to the Ministry of Education. As the loan scheme is extremely flexible and is Result Based Lending (RBL) we have the freedom to set our own targets and funds would be released only if we achieve them, he added.
It is the Ministry of Education that has to present the Education Sector Development Framework Program (ESDFP) and the ADB and the World Bank has agreed to support it. In this instance the ESDFP was US$4.9 billion of which the ADB has agreed to give US$ 200 million and the disbursement would be achieving the key results, said Herathbanda Jayasundera, Social Development Officer of the Asian Development Banks Sri Lanka mission who is in charge of coordinating the program.
Increasing the performance at the GCE O/L and GCE A/L was one such goal and statistics made available by the Ministry Of Education showed that there has been a gradual increase in the pass rate each year, Jayasundera added.
Narandeniya Central is a mixed 1AB secondary school situated in Kamburupitiya in the Matara District and has 2340 students on roll and a teaching staff of 108. Of the 795 students enrolled to the GCE Advanced Level more than a third had opted to follow course of studies in the technological stream which was introduced to the school curriculum in 2013.
Narandeniya Central College was one of the schools that introduced the technological stream for the GCE Advanced Level when it was introduced and has been able to make remarkable progress as well as achieve commendable results.
Ishan Madhushanka and Prabodha Nishadhi were two among the many who excelled at the GCE Advanced Level in 2017. Ishan was ranked 2nd in the district while Prabodha was ranked third.
In the past five decades the ADB has provided US$ 12.5 billion in loans and grants to the education sector to assist its developing member countries achieve the goal of education for all and has agreed to provide another US$ 200 million to the Ministry of Education to support ESDP 2.

Amalgamation of tastes and talents
A gala event showcasing the musical and thespian talents of primary level students of one of Sri Lankas premier boys schools St. Peters College, got underway at the open air stadium of the school recently. The creative talents of students were unleashed at this event, that earned kudos of the large and involved crowds present.
Upwards of 5000 audience members were treated to a smorgasbord of culinary delights by Na Tree Caterers, a trusted name in the food and beverage industry in this country.
The innocence and guilelessness of childhood were celebrated. Beyond Imagination 2018 encapsulated, galvanized and enthralled the audience, and compelled them to recognize the limitless possibilities of childhood imagination. It definitely was a scintillating, exciting and a tantalizing experience transcending the immediate, engaging with the creative intellectual dynamism which is uniquely human. It created the possibility to go beyond human imagination, which in itself is a tangible experience of the transcendent, said the Rector Principal of St. Peters College, Rev.Fr. Trevor Martin, assessing the event that was an amalgam of the students talents,and Na Trees hospitality.
I congratulate St. Peters College for staging an event of this nature that brings out the innate talents and creative instincts of students. We are thrilled to sponsor this extravaganza.
Students of this day and age are stressed out and often do not come by their nutritional needs as a result. Since nutrition is a key component in their intellectual development, Na Tree caterers are mindful of nutritional aspects, no matter what type of food is being prepared for consumption by students, said the CEO of Na Tree Caterers, Viran Perera.No Tree caterers also provided hospitality to the media that covered this key event in the school calendar.
Na Tree caterers, 45 year veterans in the food and beverage industry, have earned a local and international reputation for providing quality, healthy food thats free of artificial additives.
Na Tree which participates regularly in vital Social Responsibility projects, hopes to organize some special events in the near future,focusing primarily on providing schoolchildren with a healthy and wholesome diet. -NP

[APPRECIATIONS - (22-10-2018)]
Prof. Gunapala Malalasekera
The doyen of orientalists
Professor Gunapala Malalasekera, the doyen of orientalists in Sri Lanka, passed away about 40 years ago at the age of 74. Dr. Malalasekera was an intellectual giant respected as an international scholar in the land of his birth and abroad. He was born in Panadura to a family of well-known Ayurvedic physicians.
He received his primary education at St. John's College, Panadura, between 1907 and 1917. He obtained the B.A. (London) degree in 1919 and became the youngest to pass the examination in Sri Lanka. He would not have achieved this success if not for the persistent encouragement of Anagarika Dharmapala; revivalist and reformer.
Dr. Malalasekera held the post of teacher, vice principal and acting principal of Ananda College from 1921 to 1923 and left the island to do his postgraduate studies at the School of Oriental Studies of the London University.
He was one of the Sri Lankans who passed the M.A. and PhD examinations simultaneously from the London University. On his return to the island, he found that the University College had a Faculty for Languages headed by Ven. Suriyagoda Sumangala Thera, who vacated this post after five years of service.
Dr. Malalasekera was the only person then suitable for the post as there was none to teach Sinhala, Pali and Sanskrit in the English medium. He held the post of the Oriental Studies Faculty's Dean at the Ceylon University, Chief Editor of the Encyclopaedia of Buddhism; Ambassador of Ceylon to USSR (1957 - 1961), concurrently accredited to Poland, Romania and Czechoslovakia (1959 - 1961); as well as High Commissioner in Canada (1961 - 1963) and Permanent Representative for Ceylon at the United Nations (UN) for three years from 1961.
After leaving the UN in 1963, he was the High Commissioner in the United Kingdom for five years. Dr. Malalasekera was appointed as Chairman of the National Council of Higher Education on his return to Sri Lanka after a dignified service as an acclaimed Diplomat. He devoted much of his time to organisations pertaining to religious, cultural and academic subjects.
He was the Joint-Secretary of the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress for three consecutive years from 1927 and Vice President for 19 consecutive years during the period of 1939 - 1957.
He was a gifted scholar and linguist who was well-versed in many languages such as Sinhala, Pali, Sanskrit, English, German and Russian.
It was a treat to listen to his intellectual and thought-provoking speeches at public meetings.
Dr. Malalasekera was a versatile genius and authority on Philosophy, Religion, Literature, Education and Arts as he was eminent in lexicographical work.
The English-Sinhala Dictionary composed by him is one of his masterpieces that has become indispensable for students and teachers. It is regarded as one of his great contributions to the literary field.
His achievements show that there are ample opportunities for capable men in Sri Lanka to rise from humble beginnings.
His last words were, Courage in adversity and humility in success.
Dr. Gunapala Malalasekera was the most attractive personality that Sri Lanka has produced in recent times.

Remembering Shabir
The beautiful, little flower in our family withered away after a few days of sickness. Born on September 13, 2017, to Shakir and Shafeena, Shabir passed away after living only for ten months.
Our memories of his ability to perceive family members and neighbours, as well as his smiling face, leave us in tears.
Darling Shabir, these memories will linger in our hearts forever.

Alec Robertson
Erudite scholar of Buddhism
Tomorrow is the 90th birth anniversary of Alec Robertson. His passing was lamented by all Sri Lankans, as well as his numerous foreign friends and acquaintances, who had at some time or other, benefitted from his guidance, friendship and exemplary lifeand more than anything else, from his deep understanding and propagation of the Buddha Dhamma.
Sri Lanka has no dearth of Buddhist scholars among both the sangaha and the lay persons, but not many would claim to have all those and many other attributes that were abundant in Robertson. The dilemma among many Buddhist scholars is that they are unable or do not make serious efforts, to live up to the expectations of those who listen to them. They are unable to balance their obsessions with the precepts with even minimum practice. How many of us, while claiming to be Buddhists (and even highly-critical of others for their shortcomings), pay scant attention to the most basic five preceptsnot to speak of a lesser pursuit of higher states of spiritual achievement.
My own association with Alec Robertson at a personal level, was short and would not go beyond his last years. On the other hand, as a longstanding Buddhist scholar, I have followed his politic at writings and radio broadcasts. His son Prashantha happened to be a close friend of our eldest son, and it was through this fortuitous circumstance that I was able to establish personal association with Prashanthas father.
On my few visits to his home, I observed the simple and modest life of the Robertson family. In my young days, I had aspired to a life of few worldly possessions, sans houses and property. Seeing the Robertson family, I felt envy, in having by choice and circumstances, changed my life almost irrevocably. In Robertson, I saw the epitome of a life of few worldly attachments, nevertheless living a life of contentment devoid of lobha, dosha and moha.
Looking back on Alec Robertson's life, one could assume that he had been fortunate in many ways: his long sojourn as a servant of the Buddha and the dhamma. His father, Christian-born, was working in Dodanduwa, in close proximity to the Dodanduwa Island Heritage, which was the reclusive abode of the Ven. Gnanatiloka and Gnanaponika Maha Theras. They were by birth, of German origin.
Young Alec had accompanied his father on his occasional visits to the hermitage, and these encounters had left an indelible impression on the son, perhaps more than in his farther. With that initiation to the dhamma, while living and working in Colombo, young Alec continued to seek the guidance of Maha Theras such as Ven. Pelene Vajiragnana, Ven. Narada, Ven. Piyadassi Kassyapa and Ven. Soma Theras, all from the Vajirarama in Bambalapitiya.
Alec was too young to have known and interacted with Anagarika Dharmapala (1864 - 1933), but his adult life seemed to suggests that at a later and more mature age, Anagarika may have stirred his feelings and even shaped his mission in raising the level of understanding and practice of the dhamma by his fellow men and women. Another person who may have drawn Alec into the dhamma discourse was late Prof. Gunapala Malalasekera, a Buddhist activist and doyen of Pali and Buddhist scholarship. Akin to Anagarika, Alec also had a remarkable ability to expand, through his efforts, his knowledge of the dhamma through the mastery of Pali and deep understanding of the three pitakas. His remarkable memory was the other forte that adorned him as an armour in his many engaging discussions on the dhamma, often in the company of others of greater eminence and erudition.
All who have penned their appreciations of Alec Robertson and assessed his many contributions in the service of the dhamma, have been emphatic on his dexterity in responding to probing questions and clarifications on the dhamma and the life of the Buddha.
What was most remarkable about Alec were his unhesitating responses and their clarity in delivery.
This indeed, was a rarity among many contemporary Buddhist scholars, who when confronted with such verbal challenges, would wonder as lost sheep, groping for credulous answers.
Only persons who are steeped deeply in the dhamma, based solidly on the pitakas in their original Pali rendering, could be in complete control of such situations. Among those living among us, Ven. Harispattuwe Ariyawan Salankara Maha Thera is one such person.
Let me end this short appreciation with the following quote by Asoka Jayasinghe (writing in 2005) who considered himself as an adult sishya of Alec:
We are left with the memory of this great Buddhist layman whose life was that of an ideal Buddhist; both in erudition and practice.
Sabbadanam dhamma danamjinati.

Prof. M.T.M. Jiffry
Man of integrity
The untimely demise of former Sri Jayawardenepura University Medical Faculty Senior Physiology Professor and former University Grants Commission Vice Chairman Prof. M.T.M. Jiffry on September 17, 2010, created a deep void and also irreparable loss not only to his kith and kin, but also to the country as a whole.
Prof. Jiffry hailed from a humble and respectable family in Matara. He received his primary education at the Matara St. Thomas College and later entered Ananda College, Colombo, where he excelled in his studies while winning many prizes and trophies.
Prof. Jiffry then graduated from the Peradeniya University Dental Faculty and became a lecturer there.
After completing his Postgraduate Medical Science Degree, the professor joined the Colombo Medical Faculty as an associate professor of Physiology. Thereafter, he received a transfer to the Sri Jayawardenepura University. There he became the Founder-Dean of the university's Medical Sciences Faculty.
Prof. Jiffry rendered yeoman service to the faculty. He executed his duties with honesty, integrity and dedication. His academic skills and erudition were praiseworthy.
I was close to Prof. Jiffry as his contemporary during his schooldays, and I found him quite studious and hardworking. He was modest and well-mannered.
Throughout his life, Prof. Jiffry epitomised kindness and integrity. He was respected by everyone.
Prof. Jiffry won many a fellowships from many foreign universities and only few knew the charitable acts he performed.
Dear Prof. Jiffry, our loss is Allah's gain, but he only takes the best.
May Allah grant him Jannathul Firdouse.

Dr. K. Rodney Fernando
He helped underprivileged students
My dear friend and colleague Dr. Rodney Fernando was called to rest on October 11. His sudden demise following a stroke shocked all who knew him and left us with a sense of irreparable loss.
Rodney, an old boy of Joseph Vaz College, Wennappuwa, graduated from the University of Peradeniya with honours in Chemistry. He temporarily taught at the University of Ruhuna before proceeding to The University of Otago, New Zealand, for his postgraduate studies. On returning to Sri Lanka, he joined the University of Kelaniya.
During this period, the country was experiencing much unrest and at Peradeniya, we were faced with an acute shortage of teaching staff. Dr. Fernando volunteered to help us by conducting visiting lectures, and this continued for several years. Subsequently, he took up an appointment at the University of Brunei Darussalam, where he served for over 20 years before taking up an appointment at the University of Ruhuna. He was a member of the teaching staff there until his unfortunate demise.
Rodney was a dedicated academic and a conscientious lecturer. He always went the extra mile to fulfil the academic needs of his students and they would vouch for the keen interest he took in their welfare. Wherever he taught, he endeavoured to help his students in obtaining suitable employment and positions for further training.
When he spoke to me a few weeks before his death, it was to express his concern for the denial of visas by the US embassy to 27 Sri Lankan graduates who had secured places for higher studies in the US. He had even made representations to a Minister visiting the Ruhuna University and was keen on seeing that the universities took concerted action in this regard. He helped underprivileged students with funds donated by friends and colleagues, especially by those in Brunei.
Whilst in Brunei, he was instrumental in reactivating the Sri Lankan Society of Brunei Darussalam and as its president, he was instrumental in narrowing the divisions within the expatriate community stemming from the political situation prevailing in Sri Lanka at that time. Whilst there, he also used his resources to help many Sri Lankans to find employment outside Brunei. When I fell ill in Brunei, Rodney was there to attend to all my needs. It is with sadness that I reflect on my not being there for him at his hour of need.
Rodney, like all of us, went through good times and bad. He faced bad times with equanimity and enjoyed life to the fullest when things were good. He will be sadly missed by all who knew him.
Goodbye, dear friend. May you rest in peace.

Total turnover value amounted to LKR 3.15Bn (cf. last weeks value of LKR 4.37Bn), while daily average turnover value amounted to LKR 0.79 (-10.09% W-o-W) compared to last weeks average of LKR 0.87Bn.
Market capitalization meanwhile, decreased by 1.13% W-o-W (or LKR 30.64Bn) to LKR 2,736.04Bn cf. LKR 2,705.39Bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms) 
The Diversified sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 51.17% (or LKR 1.61Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by JKH & Melstacorp which accounted for 98.34% of the sectors total turnover. The Banks, Finance & Insurance sector meanwhile accounted for 33.26% (or LKR 1.05Bn) of the total turnover value, with turnover driven primarily by Commercial Bank, HNB,NDB & Sampath Bank which accounted for 89.58% of the sector turnover.

In terms of volume, HNB & Teejay Lanka led foreign purchases while Melstacorp & JKH led foreign sales. In terms of value, HNB & Sampath Bank led foreign purchases while JKH & Melstacorp led foreign sales.
Point of view 
Sri Lankan equities regained positive momentum over the week with the ASPI recording its highest daily gain in 4-months (63.4 points or 1.1%) on Friday to close the week at 5,831.96 points.
Gains on the Index helped the benchmark ASPI recover from last-weeks 5-year low of 5,761.09 and helped push the Index over the psychological 5,800-mark for the first time since Mid-October.
Index gains were driven primarily by stronger buying in index-heavy weights and blue-chip counters as Local HNI and institutional investors sought value in undervalued Sri Lankan blue-chips.
Crossings for the week consequently accounted for 73% of total market turnover this week (cf. the average of just 41% so far in 2018). While Sri Lankas main blue-chip and Index heavy-weight JKH accounted for 52% of the weeks total crossing, large parcels in fundamentally sound counters such as Commercial Bank (21% of crossings), HNB (9% of crossings) and Nestle (9% of the crossings) also helped drive buying over the week.
Activity levels on the Colombo bourse meanwhile remained mixed, with low market activity during the early part of the holiday-shortened trading week (average daily turnover on Monday and Tuesday was just Rs.0.2Bn), reversing over the latter half of the week to surpass Rs.1.0Bn on Thursday and Friday amid the strong buying activity by Local HNI & institutional investors.
Despite the positive overall momentum on the Index over the latter end of the week, the foreign equity sell-off on Sri Lankan equities continued once again this week, with foreign investors recording a net outflow of Rs. 0.4Bn (cf. Rs. 2.4Bn) as currency depreciation and global economic tensions remain major concerns for foreign investors.
Despite the sell-off, Sri Lankan equities still remain attractive due to its comparatively lower valuations (P/E of just 9.1x) cf. regional peers. Markets in the week ahead are likely to take cues from the earnings releases for the September18 quarter.
Sept inflation declines to 2 1/2 year low 
National inflation levels in September declined to its lowest since Jan16 while urban inflation levels also eased during the month, falling from 5.9% Y-o-Y in Aug18 to 4.3% Y-o-Y in Sep18.
Headline NCPI fell to 0.9% Y-o-Y in Sep18 cf. 2.5% in Aug18, sliding to a 21/2 year low (cf. -0.7% Y-o-Y in Jan16).
The decline in inflation at the national level was mainly driven by lower food prices amidst a higher base effect during the same period last year. Annual average NCPI also decreased during the month, falling to 4.0% in Sep18 from 4.7% in Aug18.
This was in line the M-o-M decline (-0.8% M-o-M) where the NCPI decreased from 125.4 points to 124.4 points in Sept18 due to lower food prices despite rising inflation levels in the non-food category.
Food inflation decelerated -4.2% Y-o-Y in Sep18 (cf. 0.0% in Aug18) while non-food inflation rose 5.2% Y-o-Y in Sep18 relative to 4.7% Y-o-Y in Aug18.
The increase in non-food inflation was driven by higher i) transport costs as a result of an upward revision in fuel prices, ii) alcoholic beverages & tobacco, iii) health care, and iv) restaurant & hotels.
Meanwhile NCPI Core inflation, which reflects the underlying inflation in the economy, increased to 3.1% Y-o-Y in Sep18 from 2.7% Y-o-Y in Aug18.
While further upward price revisions in domestic fuel prices and other administrated prices as well as imported inflation arising from the rupee devaluation could exert some pressure on the inflation levels in the coming months, the CBSL anticipates inflation to remaining within the 4% - 6% target range over the medium term on the back of decelerating food prices due to improved domestic food supplies and a favourable base effect during the rest of the year.

Blooming floral wreaths
Designer Olga Prinku combines her background in graphic design with her love of all-things crafty to create striking floral letter art. Each piece is rendered within large embroidery hoops; however, rather than stitching with yarn or thread, Prinku uses hundreds of real flowers, leaves, and seeds to form each letter shape.
This particular technique of weaving flowers on tulle actually came to me in a dream, Prinku reveals. After the initial idea struck, she began experimenting with fresh flowers but soon realized that their natural wilting process meant her designs would soon fall apart.
Now I use dry flowers, Prinku explains.
Some I buy readily dried, and some I pick from fresh and dry myself using silica gel. I also collect seed pods at the end of the season, which I use as they are.
Delicate botanicals are seen meticulously arranged in colourful patterns, together creating a blooming alphabet of bold serif-type wreaths. From white daisies and pastel-pink poppies to red leaves and rust-colored buds, Prinkus colour palette is informed depending on the season.
Im still learning a lot through experimenting about what flowers are the best, she reveals.
Im basically looking for ones that are good at holding their colour when dry and that have thin stems that I can use on the tulle.
With each new design, Prinkus love of nature grows fonder.
She says, Ive become much more observant about the plants that are growing all around where I live, and that fuels my creativity too.
Letter art is not the only thing she focuses on. She artfully weaves dried flowers and small odds and ends together to turn just about any surface that can be woven around into something truly special. From the back of a Bertoia chair to a shirt collar, Olga has used her dried flower collection to decorate so many amazing objects.

Breast cancer care
This week Oncologists, Consultant Community Physicians and other health professionals attached to the National Cancer Control Programme of the Health Ministry speak about available medical treatment for breast cancer which is the commonest cancer among Sri Lankan women.
The age specific rate of breast cancer in Sri Lanka is 22.2 per cent by last year (2016) while it was only 18 per cent in 2009. The life time breast cancer risk in Sri Lanka is one in every 40 (38) women.
Poor survival in breast cancer is mainly attributed to the advanced stage of the disease at diagnosis. The choice of treatment for breast cancer depends on the tumors as well as patient related factors.
Surgery
* Breast conserving surgery - Rages from a Lumpectomy, wide local excision to a Partial Mastectomy or Quadrantectomy.
* Mastectomy - Removal of all breast tissue including the nipple.
Breast Reconstruction Surgery can be done at the same time as Mastectomy (immediate reconstruction) or it can be carried out later (delayed reconstruction).
* Lymph Node Surgery - Sentinel lymph node biopsy may be carried out to find out the stage of the tumor.
Radiotherapy
* Breast Radiotherapy is done following breast conserving surgery.
* Chest wall Radiotherapy is done following mastectomy.
* Breast Boost - Some women may be offered a boost of high dose radiotherapy in the area where the cancer was removed.
* Radiotherapy to lymph nodes is for metastatic cancer with a spread to axillary lymph nodes.
Chemotherapy
* Neo-adjuvant is Cytotoxic medication given prior to the surgery to shrink the lump.
* Chemotherapy is usually a combination of Cytotoxic drugs are given following the surgery.
* Chemotherapy for breast cancer is given in cycles. The cycle for chemotherapy can vary from once a week to once in every three weeks. Each treatment session is followed by a period of recovery.
Hormone Treatment
For hormone receptor (Oestrogen / Progesterone) positive tumors medications that stop the body from making estrogen after menopause is given. Aromatase inhibitors are a class of medicines that reduce the amount of estrogen in your body, depriving breast cancer cells of the hormones they need to grow and thrive. Aromatase inhibitors are used to treat breast cancer.
Targeted Therapy
Therapy is targeted for tumors with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). About one in five women with breast cancer, the cancer cells have too much of a growth-promoting protein known as HER2/neu (or just HER2) on their surface. The side effects of Targeted Therapy are skin problems (acneiform rash, dry skin, nail changes, hair depigmentation), problems with blood clotting and wound healing, high blood pressure and gastrointestinal perforation (a rare side effect of some targeted therapies).

Colombo Harbour is on track to record an all-time record of handling around 7 million TUEs end of this year, said Harbour Master Capt. Athula Hewawitharana. Last year this figure was around 6 million TUEs.
He said that the Colombo Port was recognized in the world as the best harbour showing the highest growth and this mile stone was achieved as all the operators worked as one to promote Colombo Harbour.
He however said that Sri Lanka still needs to come out with better competitive rates and also offer a more efficient service.
Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) will soon introduce an online application and approval system to issue license for port related matters within 24 hours, he added.
He was speaking at the Sri Lanka Ship Suppliers Association (SLSSA) annual general meeting at the Colombo Hilton on Friday.
He said that this includes renewing of license as well and this in turn will speed up the approval process. Fresh Expressions of Interest (EOI) to develop Galle Harbour as a tourism harbour has also been called and it would be operated as a PPP project. We will study the proposals forwarded by the bidders and then decide the best plan to covert Galle as tourism harbour that could accommodate yachts as well. The SLPA has already built a breakwater at the harbour. He said currently over 600 ships call over at the Galle harbour and over 80% of these are for crew changes for supply of security personnel for ships. This operation would continue. However though we have observed an increase in ships calling over in Galle we observe a dip in them obtaining services from Galle.
Here again the suppliers must re look at their pricing structure and provide a more efficient service. He said that currently Galle Harbour lacked a bonded storage and SLPA will seek private sector investments for this.

Colossal coral ceramic
With marine life as her muse, artist and advocate Courtney Mattison crafts ceramic sculptures that promote awareness for the protection of our blue planet. Mattison explores this environmental interest in Our Changing Seas, an ongoing series focused on the fragility of the coral reef.
Reflecting the diversity of their subjects, these site-specific installations can be found in an array of locations around the world, including art museums, science centers, and even a diplomatic facility.
As a part of the Art in Embassies program, Mattison was commissioned to create Confluence (Our Changing Seas V) for the United States embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia. The 28-foot piece pays homage to the Coral Triangle, a Pacific Ocean-based site that spans the waters of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Timor Leste, and Solomon Islands. Almost 600 different species of reef-building corals exist in this 4 million-square-mile space alone, making it one of the most important under-the-sea stretches in the world.
Unfortunately, however, these coral reefs are increasingly threatened by overfishing, pollution, and a changing climate. To illustrate both the monumentality and the fragility of this ecosystem, Mattison has reproduced a reef as Confluence (Our Changing Seas V), a coil of colorful corals, billowing anemones, and delicate sea sponges.
While the porcelain and glazed earthenware invertebrates at the spirals center appear happy and healthy, disaster looms. Toward the edges and tail of the swirling constellation, Mattison explains on her website. Corals sicken and bleach, exposing their sterile white skeletons - a specter of what could be lost from climate change. Coral bleaching - a phenomenon that starves and eventually kills coral - is a major threat to reefs around the world, making it a focal point for much of Mattisons work.
By artistically presenting the consequences of climate change, the artist hopes to promote coral reef conservation - and remind people that its not too late to fix the problem.
It is possible for coral reefs to recover even from the point of bleaching if we unite and act quickly enough to decrease the threats we impose, she says. Perhaps if more people appreciate Indonesias spectacular reefs, we will act more wholeheartedly to preserve them for future generations.

Country to benefit from Mahinda Rajapaksas appointment - Artistes
Free Artistes Movement President Sudath Rohana said the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister is received as a blessing not only by the public, but also by many foreign countries. The public rejoices over Prime Minister Rajapaksas appointment at a time when the country, its culture, political system and the economy has collapsed.
Rohana also said President Maithripala Sirisenas decision to appoint Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister is the correct one.
He was speaking at a press briefing held at the Abhayarama Temple, Narahenpita, yesterday. Members of the Free Artistes Movement including Gamini Jayalath and Upali Samarasinghe participated in the press briefing.
We can say that the peoples movement launched in 2018 has finally become successful. The countrys culture, political system, and economy had collapsed. Art and culture had deteriorated. The appointment of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa is a fulfillment of the peoples wish. Many foreign countries also accept this development, Rohana said.
We are thankful to President Maithripala Sirisena for taking this accurate decision.
He fulfilled the peoples wish using the powers vested in him. Ranil Wickremesinghe did not follow the precedent of Prime Minister D.M. Jayaratne or President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Hence, the country was extremely disappointed. So we urge him to leave Temple Trees and hand over the Premiership to Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, he said.
Advisor to the Free Artistes Movement, Rohana Beddage said that artistes had won back the freedom they deserve with this change.
We are free artistes. We need government support as artistes. Then, we can act without party politics. This was not the case in the last few years. Artistes were not treated correctly. We couldnt work with satisfaction. We are glad that we won back our freedom, Beddage said.
The strongest power in this world is the power of the people. As artistes we would like to say, You are the Prime Minister, we are made from dust. We would like to request our new Prime Minister to end the era of Rupavahini, ITN and Lake House where trumpeting of the former Wickremesinghe government took place, and allow fair coverage for all parties, he said.
Executive member of Free Artistes Movement Geetha Kumarasinghe said the appointment of the new Prime Minister is the beginning of a golden age.
People were in fear of what is going to happen to the country following the economic crisis. People came to Colombo and requested a new government. Now they are rescued from the adverse situation they were in. I am thankful to President Maithripala Sirisena for this decision and would like to wish Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa all the very best.

Do we eat real organic food
Organic Agriculture is a production system that sustains the health of soils, ecosystems and people. It relies on ecological processes, biodiversity and cycles adapted to local conditions, rather than the use of inputs with adverse effects. Organic Agriculture combines tradition, innovation and science to benefit the shared environment and promote fair relationships and a good quality of life for all involved.
Organic Farming
Organic farming is an alternative agricultural system which originated early in the 20th century in reaction to rapidly changing farming practices. How the food is grown or raised can have a major impact on persons mental and emotional health as well as the environment. Organic foods often have more beneficial nutrients, such as antioxidants, than conventionally-grown foods.
Organic produce contains fewer pesticides. Chemicals such as fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides are widely used in conventional agriculture and residues remain on and in the food we eat. Organic food is often fresher because it doesnt contain preservatives that make it last longer. Organic produce is often produced on smaller farms near where it is sold. Organic farming is better for the environment. Organic farming practices reduce pollution, conserve water, reduce soil erosion, increase soil fertility, and use less energy. Farming without pesticides is also better for nearby birds and animals as well as people who live close to farms. Organically raised animals are NOT given antibiotics, growth hormones, or fed animal byproducts. Feeding livestock animal byproducts increases the risk of mad cow disease (BSE) and the use of antibiotics can create antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Organically-raised animals are given more space to move around and access to the outdoors, which help to keep them healthy.
Rich in nutrient
Organic meat and milk are richer in certain nutrients. Natural vitamins, including omega-3 fatty acids, were up to 50 percent higher in organic meat and milk than in conventionally raised versions. Also animals are reared in a happy environment. Organically grown foods have more nutrients vitamins (27%), minerals (21.1% more iron, 29.3% more magnesium; 13.6% more phosphorus), enzymes, and micronutrients than commercially grown foods because the soil is managed and nourished with sustainable practices by responsible standards.
Organic food is GMO-free. GMOs or genetically engineered (GE) foods are plants whose DNA has been altered in ways that cannot occur in nature or in traditional crossbreeding, most commonly in order to be resistant to pesticides or produce an insecticide. Some animal studies have indicated that consuming GMOs may cause internal organ damage, slowed brain growth, and thickening of the digestive tract. GMOs have been linked to increased food allergens and gastro-intestinal problems in humans and altering the DNA of a plant or animal can increase the risk of cancer. Organic food is pesticide-free. As mentioned above, one of the primary benefits of eating organic is lower levels of pesticides. However, organic farms do use pesticides. The difference is that they only use naturally-derived pesticides, rather than the synthetic pesticides used on conventional commercial farms.
Better taste
Organic food gives better taste. Organically grown foods generally taste better because nourished, well balanced soil produces healthy, strong plants varieties, which are cultivated for taste over appearance. Organic farming preserves agricultural diversity. It is estimated that 75% of the genetic diversity of agricultural crops has been lost in the last century. Crop rotation is a simple and effective technique used in organic agriculture to reduce the need for pesticides and improve soil fertility. Many organic farms grow and assorted range of food, taking natural elements and time-tested tradition into account. Organic food purchase allows us to support farming directly. Spending in the organic sector by buying organic food is a direct vote for a sustainable future for the many generations to come
Bit of History
Traditional farming was the original type of agriculture, and has been practiced for thousands of years. All traditional farming is now considered to be organic farming although at the time there were no known inorganic methods eventually an organic movement began in the 1940s.
Principles of organic agriculture
There are four principles of organic agriculture called as health, ecology, fairness and care are the roots from which Organic Agriculture grows and develops.
Health is the wholeness and integrity of living systems. It is not simply the absence of illness, but the maintenance of physical, mental, social and ecological well-being. Ecology is the principle roots Organic Agriculture within living ecological systems. Fairness is characterized by equity, respect, justice and stewardship of the shared world, both among people and in their relations to other living beings. The principle care states that precaution and responsibility are the key concerns in management, development and technology choices in Organic Agriculture.
Supply to Organic farming demand
The rise of organic farming was driven by small, independent producers and by consumers. In recent years, explosive organic market growth has encouraged the participation of agribusiness interests. As the volume and variety of organic products increases, the viability of the small-scale organic farm is at risk, and the meaning of organic farming as an agricultural method is ever more easily confused with the related but separate areas of organic food and organic certification. There is a huge demand from the consumers for food which is unable to supply by organic farming as the yield is less than conventional farming. But when the food wastage from harvest to consumption is reduced, the supply to demand will not be a problem by organic farming.

Faces of the war
Nicolas Lamade leaned over and expressed his amazement. The auditorium of the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute was packed with an eclectic audience: army generals, clergymen, politicians, activists, journalists, lawyers, and tourists. Lamade, Deputy Program Director of the German reconciliation project GIZ, first came to Sri Lanka in the early 2000s when, he said, no one dared to question official versions of wartime events in public, let alone speak out about misconceptions of those events. A decade later, Lamade marvelled at the apparent change in Sri Lankan society.
The new book by Sarah Kabir, Voices of Peace: They were just like us, capitalises on this moment of freedom. With the poignant perspectives of 20 combatants, 10 former members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and 10 members of the Sri Lankan Army (SLA), Sarah challenges accepted notions of wartime division. People might hate me for saying this, she said, but I dont like the fact that most people in Colombo sit and talk about the war like they know what has happened.
Growing up during the war
Sarah is 29 years old, and grew up in the midst of Sri Lankas lengthy civil war. Her earliest childhood memories are interspersed with war effects; she recalled learning that, school was closed one day because a bomb had gone off.
Sarah's school was closed repeatedly, and at the time, she didnt understand why that happened. It didnt hit me that so much atrocity was going on somewhere else, she said, referring to it as a detachment. But the same lack of understanding ultimately drove Sarah to explore the conflict more deeply.
Aaranya Rajasingam, a womens rights and peace activist who spoke at the book launch, called Voices of Peace an attempt to understand what we dont know, a subject in which, there are more questions than answers.
Sarah explains that the project was a way for her to listen to the people who were actually there during the war. They know better. Combatants had agency during the war, says Sarah, "They fought and they killed, and now they have no say in the peace process."
Before she began the project, in July 2016, Sarah had misconceptions about culpability during the war. Id been working in civil society for a long time, and the narrative that we normally hear, or the narrative that we seem to keep talking about, is that the military are perpetrators and they violated all the rules. I really strongly believed that. Her perceptions about the military made her more sympathetic towards the LTTE than the SLA. But when I went and met these people, it changed my opinion entirely about the military, said Sarah, it made me realise that these people are human too, and I had kept painting them as this one entity over another, and now Ive learnt better after listening to them.
After writing Voices of Peace, Sarah has a much more nuanced understanding of the dimensions of Sri Lankas conflict. She spent the better part of a year conducting 60 interviews with people from both sides.
Sarah heard about their private lives, their families, their passions, and how their role in the war fit into that. She saw them as human beings. It allowed her to see their memories of violence differently, and she never shied away from the images she calls gory. What bothered her more, said Sarah, was her own ability to become inured to them.
At one point you get sort of numb, she says, and youre sort of like, Okay Ive heard this. Okay, moving on. When that starts happening you really are not able to empathise with them, and then, you cant connect. So you really need to take a breather and come back again after a small break.
Sarahs Tamil translator, Sophia Mahendran, took a break during the project to be in silence, so that she could come back and engage with the full emotional weight of the stories she was hearing.
After collecting the interviews, Sarah was nervous about how she would go about representing her sources.
I spent a long time after the research trying to make sure that I didnt implicate them in anything, she says, So I went to lawyers, and I spent a lot of time, because they trusted me and I didnt want them to get into any trouble.
Her experience indicates that fear and the possibility of retribution stymie the reconciliation process. In that way, Sarahs experience has already been remarkably successful, marked at least by some of the attendees at her book launch, including former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
Possibly the most subversive aspect of Voices of Peace is Sarahs attempt to blur the lines between the LTTE and SLA. She organised the book by themes, layering quotes from different combatants one over another, without labels other than their names.
The intention, she explains, was to make the readers think, Oh, he could be LTTE or he could be military. You couldnt even tell the difference at times.
Rajasingam wondered if this structure inadvertently made it more difficult for readers to empathise with Sarahs characters, but praised the book as well, calling it a much needed effort to counteract societys appalling ignorance about this.
Labelling
Sarahs experience researching and writing Voices of Peace has taught her that labels only serve to reduce our understanding or studies of armed groups. What would serve better is to really try to understand what drove them to arms and what their ideologies are or were.
She is critical of labelling members of the LTTE as terrorists, saying, Anyone who truly wants peace in Sri Lanka would stop themselves from labelling individuals on either side as wrong, evil, or terrorist.
She also distinguishes between the individuals who made up the LTTE, and the LTTE as an organisation. We cannot forget or justify the atrocities they committed, says Sarah. She recalls the arbitrary and indiscriminate killing of civilians, the bombing at the Central Bank, and the assassination of Gamini Dissanayake, who she says, could have led this country to a place of strength and compassion.
'A father, lover, daughter or husband'
Voices of Peace complicates these labels, Sarah hopes, by portraying the people who were complicit in these actions as real: The same storyteller was also a father, lover, daughter or husband. So we cannot paint them as one or the other.
And its the same with the Sri Lankan military. A common narrative we hear now is of how the military violated international humanitarian law, she continues, When doing that, we must be careful not to paint the individuals who fought with the military as perpetrators. They tell us how much it hurts them after everything they sacrificed, after all they did for the country, to now be labelled as perpetrators.
Sarah is careful not to alienate any parties in her explanations.
Voices of Peace has been published first in English, which somewhat disappointed her; Sarah always envisioned that the book would be published in English, Sinhala, and Tamil at the same time. Sinhala and Tamil translations are underway, and the possibility of a German translation has been proposed. Sarah will soon be publishing Voices of Peace online, and is eagerly looking for more ways to disseminate her work.
If we care about peace, she says, lets remember that these people are all human to begin with.
