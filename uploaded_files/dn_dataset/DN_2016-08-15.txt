Asalankas all-round blitz puts Sri Lanka U19s in the lead
Charith Asalanka launching to a typical captains role put his side in the lead of the three-match one-day series against their English counterparts when his all-round blitz that included a match-winning 70 runs and two wickets propelled Sri Lanka U19 to a big win over England U19s in the opening match of the series concluded on Wednesday at Sir Paul Getty's Ground, Wormsley.

This was Sri Lankan youths second win against hosts on this tour after Sri Lanka won the two-match Youth Test series 1-0.
Sri Lanka won a good toss to take the first lease on a perfect batting track before they scored 257 for seven in their 50 overs thanks to two good knocks from skipper Charith Asalanka (70) and Sammu Ashan an unbeaten 60 from just 62 balls.
Though Sri Lanka lost their first wicket in the very first over, Avishka Fernando and Asalanka carried their score to 67 before Avishka got out for a patient 30 and then Asalanka shared another good stand of 77 with his school-mate, Wanindu Hasaranga for the third wicket before Sammu Ashans brilliant knock helped Sri Lanka reach a challenging total after their allotted 50 overs.
Despite skipper Max Holdens 40 at the top, Englands reply never achieved the necessary momentum against the Lankan spin-attack led by Damitha Silva who took 3 for 28 as hosts succumbed to 149 all out in slightly less than 41 overs losing their last eight wickets for just 53 runs to award Lankans the victory with a big-margin of 108 runs and also the lead of the three- match series.
Three Lankan spinners Damitha Silva, Charith Asalanka and Wanindu Hasaranga shared 7 wickets among them making things extremely difficult for the England batsmen.
Sri Lanka U19 : 257-7 in 50 overs (Charith Asalanka 70, Sammu Ashan 60*, Wanindu Hasaranga 37, Avishka Fernando 30, HR Bernard 2/43, BGF Green 2/46)
England U19 : 149 in 40.3 overs (MDE Holden 40, Z Malik 32, Damitha Silva 3/28, Charith Asalanka 2/27, Wanindu Hasaranga 2/28, Thilan Prasan 2/32)

Seven teams qualify for quarter finals
Three teams from outstations and four teams from Colombo winning their pre quarter-final fixtures played during the week ending from August 13 were qualified to go through to the quarter-final round of 2016 U17 Division One Tournament.
Only Richmond, Galle out of the four outstation teams entered into the final round failed to impress and the rest, St.Aloysius - Galle, Mahinda  Galle and Maliyadeva A  Kurunegala all booked their places in quarter-finals whilst DS Senanayaka, Ananda, St.Peters and Thurstan qualified from Colombo and suburbs.
In pre quarter-finals, Maliyadewa and St.Aloysius recorded stunning wins over St.Josephs and Wesley whilst DSS, Ananda, Mahinda, St.Peters and Thurstan won their pre quarter-final fixtures against Devapathiraja, Gurukula, Kingswood, Prince of Wales and Richmond respectively.
Maliyadeva stun St. Josephs
Maliyadevas two-wicket win over St.Josephs, Colombo after a dramatic chase was a fascinating win for Kurunegala school as they successfully chased down an imposing target of 261 with 9 balls to spare to win the match by two wickets. It was Dulaj Ranatunga (70) and Janith Deshan (51) who made things easy for Maliyadeva in this dynamic run-chase.
St. Josephs: 260 in 49.2 overs (Revan Kelly 86, Cameron Duruge 34, Nagendran Vishmithan 29, Sahan Ranatunga 3/41, Sanjeewan Priyadharshana 2/59)

Kavikas five-for puts St. Aloysius on top
After Kavika Dilshans amazing bowling effort that earned him a five-for at a cost of mere six runs and restricted Wesley to a paltry 104 made their batsmens task easier, St. Aloysius in reply recorded a comfortable 6-wicket win with more than 31 overs to spare.
Wesley: 104 in 33.3 overs (Chamal Namesh 32, Thimira Jayasekara 16, Kavika Dilshan 5/6, Hareen Buddila 2/20)
St. Aloysius: 107/4 in 18.4 overs (Ravindu Sanjana 18, Imsaf Iqbal 17, Kavinda Dissanayake 2/17, Shenal Dangalla 2/24)
Ashen ensures Mahindians quarter-final berth
Kingswood were never in the hunt for runs after Mahinda batting first scored an imposing 238 for five in 47 overs - match reduced to a 47-over affair due to late start  with both Ravindu Hansika and Pramitha Thewarapperuma making fifties. It was Ashen Kandambi who did the rest helping Mahinda bowl out Kingswood for 122 to win the match by a huge margin of 116 runs, after Mahindian batsmen did their part.
Mahinda: 238/5 in 47 overs (Ravindu Hansika 56, Pramitha Thewarapperuma 50 n.o.)
Kingswood: 122 in 46.3 overs (Kusal Madhwa 25, Dilan Madhuranga 24, Thimira Wijenarayana 24, Ashen Kandambi 5/18, Pradeep Gunathilake 3/22)
Sachin helps St.Peter's
Sachin Silva scoring a match-winning 82 helped St.Peters chase down an over-two-hundred target successfully with 9 balls to spare winning their match against Prince of Wales, Moratuwa by three wickets after POW batting first scored 214 for eight with Shamindu Viraj (70) and Ravindu Lochana (54) making bulk of scoring.

Muditha and Vihan steer DSS to quarter-finals
Muditha Lakshan and Vihan Gunasekara both scoring fifties propelled DSS to a comprehensive 7-wicket win over Devapathiraja in their pre-quarter final match played at Bloomfield ground. Muditha Lakshans all-round effort with an unbeaten 51 and an amazing 3 wickets conceding just 6 runs immensely helped DSS win this match after a splendid run-chase in just 39 overs.

Sigera and Sanath carry Ananda to quarters
A dominant bowling attack led by Sanath Dasanayake finishing with figures of 4 for 13 helped Ananda dismiss Gurukula for a paltry 98 in just 28 overs to win the match by a wide-margin of 89 runs. Asel Sigeras good double of 45 runs and two wickets played a vital part in Anandas victory.
Ananda: 187 in 50 overs (Ashel Sigera 45, Dushan Hettige 32, Induwara Ranathunga 20, Sachintha Chamith 3/24, Ushan Malith 3/38, Pruthuwi Rusara 2/22)

Yeshan Wickramarachchi with the bat and Bimara Ranatunga with the ball ensured Thurstans quarter-final berth as Richmond in their reply innings chasing a modest 179 succumbed to 106 all out in just under 32 overs after Bimara Ranatunga claimed a five-for conceding 28 runs.
Thurstan : 179 in 48.2 overs (Yeshan Wickramarachchi 75, Sawan Prabash 26, Wishmitha Wijesiri 3/31, Ravishka Wijesiri 2/33, Akash Kavinda 2/33)

SSC and Army Under 23 to meet in the finals
SSC U23 and Army U23 booked their places in the finals of 2016 U23 D1 T20 Tournament when they beat their respective oppositions, NCC and CCC in contrasting passion in the two semifinals concluded on Saturday at P Sara Oval.
Both teams who became victorious at the last moment were struggling against the dominance of their oppositions midway through the reply innings. When SSC needed runs after NCC bowlers pushed them to a hopeless position, their skipper Ramesh Mendis came to their rescue and won the match for them scoring an unbeaten 74 whilst Ashan Randika completing a hat-trick took the wickets Army needed and won the match for them though CCC threw their wickets away after a glorious start. The finals of this tournament will be played on Sunday the 14th at the same venue.
Earlier, after the completion of the first round matches of 2016 U23 D1 T20 Tournament conducted by SLC, NCC, CCC and SSC finished on top of Group A, B & D respectively on points whilst Army beating their closest rivals, Colts in one of the most crucial encounters ended on Wednesday at Colts ground hit the top of group C on Net-run-rate ahead of Colts after both teams finished first-round on equal points.
These four teams NCC, CCC, SSC and Army after they became leaders of each group were qualified to play in the semifinals.

Ramesh Mendis making a bat and ball contribution that was one of his bests at U23 level helped SSC clinch a final-over win over NCC in this all important semifinal and become one of the finalists of this tournament.
Former Dharmasoka player and the skipper of SSC, Ramesh Mendis hit a sparkling 45-ball 74 with 3 fours and five sixes following his four wickets with the ball launching a perfect repair job at a time SSCs Cup-final hopes were hanging on a thread at 47-4, chasing 176. Ramesh shared two good partnerships, 93 for the fifth wicket with Yohan Mendis (38) to bring SSC back on track and 39 with Adeesha Thilanchana (14*), one of his school-mates for the unfinished sixth wicket to get to the target with five balls remaining.
Earlier, NCC batting first after they were put in posted a formidable 175 for seven in 20 overs. Had the NCC middle order made the full use of the brutal start their openers, Niroshan Dickwella and Lahiru Udara got off to surging to 65 from just 32 balls, NCCs final total would have been an enormous one, but except for the Lahiru Udaras 26-ball 57 including 5 fours and four sixes and Pawan Wickramasinghes brisk 41 no other NCC batsman could make a sizable contribution especially against a bowling attack that became more disciplined towards the end of NCC innings.
NCC U23: 175/7 in 20 overs (Lahiru Udara 57, Pawan Wickramasinghe 41, Niroshan Dickwella 19, Ramesh Mendis 4/29, Tharindu Rathnayake 1/36, Nuwan Thushara 1/36)
SSC U23: 179/5 in 19.1 overs (Ramesh Mendis 74*, Yohan Mendis 38, Minod Bhanuka 23, Nimesha Gurusinghe 2/08)
1ST SEMIFINAL - SSC WON BY 5 WICKETS
Ashan Randikas hat-trick wins the match for Army
Ashan Randikas four-ball spell that earned him a rare hat-trick at a cost of a solitary run coupled with CCCs poor batting towards the latter part of their innings deprived CCC of a place in Sundays final as Army after a modest show with the bat recorded a rebounding win beating CCC by 13 runs in the second semifinal played at P Sara Oval to become the other finalist in this tournament.
After Ranitha Liyanarachchi (3/14) and Shaluka Silva (2/21) restricted Army to an undemanding total of 133, CCC openers, Malindu Maduranga and Ron Chandraguptha gave them a perfect start with an opening stand of 53 from just 29 balls before CCC lost the momentum completely due to a collapse that cost them four wickets with the addition of just 6 runs to the total.
However, CCCs middle order led by Trinity spin-wizard Raveen Sayer recharging their innings took their side closer to the victory with 26 runs to get from 15 balls. Though CCC had three wickets to do so, Ashan Randika bowling for the first time in the match got rid of last three CCC batsmen completing a hat-trick to dismiss CCC with 14 runs short of their target.
Army U23: 133/8 in 20 overs (Leo Francisco 23, Himasha Liyanage 21, Ranitha Liyanarachchi 3/14, Shaluka Silva 2/21)
CCC U23: 120 in 18.4 overs (Malindu Maduranga 27, Raveen Sayer 24, Ron Chandraguptha 23, Yohan de Silva 2/28, Ashan Randika 3/01(hat-trick)

Fernando, Ashan lead SL to series-clinching victory
CHELMSFORD: Sri Lanka held their nerve to claim the Royal London Under-19 one-day series with one match to spare after a tense finish in Chelmsford on Saturday.
The tourists, who had won the first match of the series comfortably in Wormsley last Wednesday, seemed to be cruising again at 229 for three in the 36th over, after England had posted 315 for 8. But the dismissal of their opener Avishka Fernando for an excellent 117, run out by a direct hit from Somerset's offspinner Dom Bess who was again the pick of England's bowlers, breathed fresh life into the contest.
Ben Green, Bess's Somerset team-mate, took three wickets and there were two more run-outs, leaving Sri Lanka nine wickets down and still needing two to win at the start of the 50th over. But Shammu Ashan, who scored an unbeaten 60 at Wormsley, drove the first ball from Aaron Beard through the covers for the match-winning boundary, to set off wild celebrations among the Sri Lankans - who completed a 1-0 win in the two-match four-day series between the teams earlier this month.
Ashan ended with 77 from 75 balls, and England will now be playing for pride in the last match of the series at the St Lawrence ground in Canterbury on Tuesday - a day-night match starting at 2pm.
England's total had been built around three significant contributions from Tom Moores, George Hankins and George Bartlett - all old boys of Millfield School. Moores, the Nottinghamshire wicketkeeper-batsman who has just completed a successful loan spell at Lancashire, came in to open with captain Max Holden, and shrugged off the loss of his partner in the first over to make 70 from 68 balls with nine fours and a six.
Hankins, the tall Gloucestershire right-hander who had opened in the defeat at Wormsley, played a sensible supporting role in stands of 123 in 24 overs with Moores, and 148 in 22 with Bartlett. The latter fell in the 47th over for 85 from 68 balls with eight fours and two sixes, one of them soaring over long-on and into the River Can. Hankins then fell agonisingly short of a century, middling a square cut but picking out backward point after making 98 from 144 balls. Worcestershire's Zen Malik and Surrey wicketkeeper Ollie Pope contributed handy cameos in the closing overs, allowing England to set a tough target.
But Sri Lanka made a flying start to their reply, with an opening stand of 67 inside nine overs before Yorkshire's Ed Barnes had Dilan Jayalath coolly caught on the square leg boundary by Malik for 41 from 34 balls.
That was the first of three boundary catches by Malik, and Bess bowled beautifully to concede only 36 in his 10 overs. Worcestershire's left-arm spinner Ben Twohig took two wickets on his debut, but England paid a heavy penalty for an inconsistent ground-fielding display.

England U19 : 315-8 in 50 overs (T Moores 70, G Hankins 98, G Bartlett 85, Lahiru Kumara 4/56, Jehan Daniel 2/70)
Sri Lanka U19 : 318-9 in 49.1 overs (Dilan Jayalath 41, Avishka Fernando 117, Charith Asalanka 27, Shammu Ashan 77 n.o., B Green 3/77, B Twohig 2/55)

India thrash West Indies to secure series
ST. LUCIA, SATURDAY: India routed the West Indies to complete a series-clinching victory by the comprehensive margin of 237 runs just before tea on the final day of the third Test in St Lucia on Saturday.
West Indies were set the improbable target of 346 to win at the Darren Sammy National Stadium after the Indians declared their second innings at 217 for seven 40 minutes into the day's play.
Only Darren Bravo with 59 displayed any form of meaningful resistance with the visitors potent mix of pace and spin proving too much for Caribbean batsmen technically and temperamentally ill-equipped to cope with the challenge.
And in the end they gave yet another inept batting display, being bowled out for 108, their second-lowest total ever in a Test against India.
Seamer Mohammed Shami spearheaded the assault in taking three for 11 but all the bowlers made key contributions in consigning the West Indies to defeat.
It not only gave India a 2-0 series lead with one match left in Port of Spain next week, but also represented the first time ever that they had won more than a single Test match in 11 series in the Caribbean dating back to their first visit to the region in 1952. We've done quite a few firsts in the last year as a Test team, said Indian captain Virat Kohli in acknowledging his team's historic achievement.
Credit goes to the entire squad because we recognised where we went wrong in Jamaica and corrected those things here.
Lone bright spot
In the lone bright spot for the West Indies on the day, fast-medium bowler Miguel Cummins reaped a bountiful harvest in the morning, taking all four wickets as India pushed for quick runs to facilitate a declaration.
Cummins finished with innings figures of six for 48 for a nine-wicket match haul.
Ajinkya Rahane kept the runs flowing as the wickets tumbled around him in reaching an unbeaten 78.
Frustrated by rain and West Indian defiance in settling for a draw in the second Test, the Indian strike bowlers put the home side immediately on the back foot at the start of their second innings with both openers prised out by the fifth over.
Leon Johnson departed without scoring, fending a lifting delivery from Shami into the hands of Rohit Sharma at forward short-leg.
His opening partner, Kraigg Brathwaite, fell in the very next over as an inswinger from first-innings destroyer Bhuvneshwar Kumar trapped him leg-before.
Ishant Sharma then took two important wickets either side of the lunch interval, uprooting Marlon Samuels off-stump and also comprehensively bowling Roston Chase, the man whose maiden Test hundred on the last day in Kingston was fundamental to the West Indies saving that fixture.
Jermaine Blackwood's impetuosity got the better of him when he was stumped off Ravindra Jadeja and the ignominious slide to another embarrassing defeat continued when Shane Dowrich edged Shami to Kohli at second slip.
Jason Holder's misery as West Indies captain was only magnified when he was run out seeking a non-existent single. AFP

Golden goodbye as Phelps signs off with 23
RIO DE JANEIRO, SATURDAY: Michael Phelps brought down the curtain on his record-breaking career with his 23rd Olympic gold medal as Mo Farah stole the show at the athletics with a gritty 10,000m win on Saturday.
Ryan Murphy broke a seven-year-old world record in the backstroke leg of the 4x100m medley relay, but Phelps still needed to come from behind on the butterfly before Nathan Adrian touched in a new Olympic mark of 3min 27.95sec.
It was a fittingly triumphant swansong for Phelps, 31, the most decorated Olympian in history who added five golds and a silver in Rio to finish with 28 medals overall.
Earlier the United States also won the women's 4x100m medley relay -- the country's 1,000th gold medal in Olympic competition according to the US Olympic Committee. Usain Bolt launched his bid for the treble-treble by cantering through the 100m preliminaries but all eyes were on Farah as he survived a nasty fall to retain his 10,000m crown.
Farah picked himself up after being clipped by training partner Galen Rupp and he produced a trademark surge on the last bend to win it in 27min 05.17sec.
When I went down, I thought, Oh my God, that is it. I just got up and wanted to stick with the guys and stay strong, Farah said. It's never easy but everyone knows what I can do.
Elaine Thompson ended the reign of Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce with a women's 100m victory of 10.71sec which torpedoed her fellow Jamaican's hopes of an Olympic hat-trick in the event.
Tori Bowie of the United States took silver with 10.83sec while Fraser-Pryce claimed bronze in 10.86.
Twenty-one golds were on offer on Super Saturday but there was no repeat for Britain's golden girl Jessica Ennis-Hill, who was dramatically denied a second straight heptathlon win.
Belgium's Nafissatou Thiam needed to finish the last event, the 800m, within nine seconds of Ennis-Hill, and she made it -- just -- when she crossed 7.47sec behind.
American Jeff Henderson won the long jump with a leap of 8.38m, and immediately dedicated the victory to his mother, who has Alzheimer's disease.
My mum can't be here, she has Alzheimer's. When I place that medal in her hands, I'll be crying, Henderson said.
Earlier, Britain's women's team pursuit cyclists set a sizzling world record and Juan Martin del Potro won a thriller with Rafael Nadal to reach the men's tennis final.
Germany's Christoph Harting won discus gold to keep the title in the family after his brother Robert, the 2012 champion, ruined his chances by straining his back while turning off a light with his foot.
At the velodrome, Britain's Katie Archibald, Laura Trott, Elinor Barker and Joanna Rowsell-Shand smashed the women's team pursuit world record for the second time in 48 hours to take gold, beating world champions USA to defend their title.

Thompson becomes new Jamaican sprint queen
RIO DE JANEIRO, SUNDAY: Elaine Thompson stormed to victory in the women's 100m to usher in a new era for Jamaican sprinting as the eight-year Olympic reign of compatriot Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce came to an end.
Thompson, 24, got off to a flying start and quickly surged to the front to cross in 10.71sec, punching the air before embracing training partner Fraser-Pryce.
Tori Bowie of the United States took silver with 10.83sec while Fraser-Pryce claimed bronze in 10.86.
Afterwards Saturday's race, Thompson revealed she could never have dreamed of upstaging Fraser-Pryce when the Jamaican star landed her first Olympic 100m title in 2008.
I look up to her so much but I never thought I'd be sitting here today, said Thompson.
When I crossed the line and glanced across to see I was clear (I) didn't quite know how to celebrate, she added.
There is a big screen back home in my community in Jamaica. I can't imagine what is happening there right now.
Fraser-Pryce, 29, had been hoping for a hat-trick of 100m titles after gold medals in the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games.
But it was Thompson who confirmed herself as the standard-bearer of Jamaican women's sprinting with an imperious display.
What I'm most happy about is that the 100m title is staying in Jamaica, said Fraser-Pryce, who raced with her hair dyed in Jamaica's national colours. I'm on the podium with my training partner. I'm proud of Jamaica - just look at my hair, she added, paying tribute to Thompson.
It's her time
I am really happy for her. I've seen her work hard and it was her time. In 2008 it was my time, 2016 it is her time.
Fraser-Pryce revealed she had also been struggling with an injury. She finished her semi-final grimacing as she crossed the line.
It was really difficult. I cried, because it was unbearable. I knew I had one more race to go and I just prayed to God, she said. It has been a challenging season for Fraser-Pryce, who has struggled to shake off a toe injury which has troubled her throughout the year. By far, I would definitely say that this is my best championship ever, because I knew how hard I worked, I knew the pain and and the sacrifices and the tears.
I knew everything and despite everything I stuck to it. I kept my head in the game. I am really happy that I persevered.
Exploding out of the blocks, Thompson quickly edged clear of the field and the powerfully built runner never looked like relinquishing her grip on the contest.
Marie-Josee Ta Lou of Ivory Coast finished fourth while flying Dutchwoman Dafne Schippers, a strong favourite for the 200m, was fifth in 10.90sec.
Michelle-Lee Ahye of Trinidad and Tobago and English Gardner of the United States also dipped under 11 seconds with times of 10.92sec and 10.94 respectively.
It was the first time in track and field history that seven women have gone under 11 seconds in a single race.
Fraser-Pryce meanwhile refused to be drawn on her future beyond Rio.
I'll be 33 in 2020 for Tokyo. Let's wait and see, she said. AFP

Shah stars as Pakistan beat England to draw series
London, Sunday:Yasir Shah took five wickets as Pakistan marked the country's Independence Day with a 10-wicket win over England in the fourth Test at The Oval on Sunday.
Victory saw Pakistan end the four-match series all square at 2-2 on an Oval ground where they won their first Test match in England back in 1954.
England, 88 for four overnight, were dismissed for 253 in their second innings, with Shah taking five for 71 in 29 overs after Jonny Bairstow top-scored with 81.
That left Pakistan needing just 40 to win after excellent hundreds by man-of-the-match Younis Khan (218) and Asad Shafiq (109) had helped them compile a commanding first-innings total of 542.
Azhar Ali (30 not out) ended the match by hitting Moeen Ali for a straight six as Pakistan finished on 42 without loss.
Sami Aslam was 12 not out as Pakistan bounced back from their 141-run defeat in the third Test at Edgbaston in style.
"It was special, keeping in mind it was Independence Day it was something special to draw the series here after being 2-1 down, losing the second Test badly and losing the third," delighted Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq told BBC Radio's Test Match Special.
"But the way the team fought back, I'm a really happy captain."
Man-of-the-match Younis added: "As a senior player I always want to contribute. Thats why it (the double century) was on the right time."
Pakistan remain third in the world Test rankings but, following this win, could rise to number one if results in Sri Lanka and the West Indies go their way.
But Sunday's result scuppered England's immediate hopes of climbing to the top of the standings.
"We played at a disappointing level -- we've drawn a series so it's not the end of the world, but we had the opportunity to beat Pakistan and it's frustrating," said England captain Alastair Cook.
"We didn't bat, bowl or field well enough."
England resumed in trouble at 88 for four, 126 runs adrift, after Shah had ripped through the top order with three for 15 late on Saturday.
Gary Ballance was four not out and Jonny Bairstow 14 not out.
Ballance though was out for 17 when, playing carelessly away from his body, he was caught behind off Sohail Khan.
New batsman Moeen Ali had frustrated Pakistan with a first-innings 108 and shared a partnership of 93 with Bairstow.
But Ali fell for 32 when he went back defensively to Shah and got a thin edge which wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed held at the second attempt to end a stand of 65.
England were 194 for six at lunch, still 20 behind, with Bairstow 70 not out.
But they lost two wickets in two balls soon afterwards to be 209 for eight.
Chris Woakes, backing up too far and deceived as Bairstow set off, was run out for just four by bowler Wahab Riaz's direct hit on the non-striker's stumps.
Next ball, Bairstow chipped Riaz straight to Azhar in the covers to end a 127-ball innings featuring eight fours.
Shah, who took 10 wickets during Pakistan's 75-run win in the first Test across London at Lord's, enjoyed further success in the capital when Stuart Broad (five) reverse swept-him straight to Younis at first slip -- an extraordinary shot given England's position. AFP

Australia enjoy their best day on the field
Australia perhaps had their best day with the bat for the first time in the series when they closed the second day of the third and final Test against Sri Lanka on a healthy 141 for one wicket courtesy of fighting unbeaten half-centuries from skipper Steve Smith (61 off 108 balls) and Shaun Marsh (64 off 141 balls) at the SSC grounds yesterday.
Dinesh Chandimal celebrates his seventh Test century on the second day of the third and final Test against Australia at the SSC grounds yesterday.Pictures by Rukmal Gamage,
The pair batted with determination and using their feet well to the Lankan spinners has so far put together their first century partnership of the series  120 off 234 balls, after losing David Warner to the last ball before the tea break for 11.
Australia still trail Sri Lanka by 214 runs and have a lot of batting ahead of them because they will be batting last on this pitch which is expected to take more spin with the passing days.
The fact that there were no lbw dismissals in the Sri Lanka or the Australian innings so far gave an indication of how the pitch is playing compared to the 20 lbw decisions that were given in the first two Tests at Pallekele and Galle.
If Australia took the honours in the final session, the first two were dominated against by Sri Lanka with vice-captain Dinesh Chandimal producing a workmanlike century to carry his team to a respectable first innings total of 355.
Chandimals seventh Test hundred and his first against Australia coupled with that of Dhananjaya de Silvas knock of 129 saw Sri Lanka lift themselves off the floor from a lowly 26-5 courtesy of a record sixth wicket partnership of 211 between the two centurions.
De Silva captured the headlines on the opening day with his maiden Test century, and yesterday it was the turn of Chandimal who displayed great resolve to play a responsible innings for his team.
Chandimal played second fiddle to De Silva in the big partnership but after his partner was dismissed in the 14th over of the morning for 129 after hitting 18 fours off 280 balls, he took control of the innings to reach his century which he celebrated with an eruption of emotion leaping in the air and punching it. It was the first time in 82 years that numbers six and seven had made centuries in a Test, the last occasion being England pair Maurice Leyland and Les Ames against Australia at Lords in 1934.
Chandimal carried the fight to the Aussies bowlers and after De Silvas departure at 237, figured in valuable partnerships with the tail to further frustrate the opposition.
The most crucial of those stands was with Rangana Herath who went onto play another gutty knock of 33 in a stand of 73 for the eighth wicket before he was forced to retire hurt after being hit a painful blow on his groin by Jos Hazlewood.
Herath did not take the field in the few minutes Australia batted before the tea break but recovered sufficiently to resume bowling in the final session without showing any discomfort. Chandimal after his eight-hour batting marathon suffered from dehydration and although he took the field did not keep wickets  Kusal Perera taking over that role.
Mitchell Starc, Australias star fast bowler cleaned up the Lankan tail to finish with his third consecutive five-for in the series that took his tally of wickets to 22, more than any bowler in the series.
Australian captain Steve Smith had a horrible day on the field dropping Chandimal at 100 off the luckless Jon Holland and Herath at 28 off Mitch Marsh - both chances going abegging at slip, but later compensated to some extent with the bat. Sri Lanka leads the three-match series 2-0.
Chandimal punches one through the off side during his knock of 132.

Sri Lanka crowned U20 Asian rugby champs
Sri Lanka were crowned overall champions at the Asian under 20 Sevens rugby championship which concluded at Kings Park in Hong Kong on Saturday despite losing their second leg final to host Hong Kong 10-36.
Sri Lanka who won the first leg in Johor Bahru, Malaysia and made it to the final in Hong Kong and thus took the series honours by grabbing the overall title for 2016.
Hong Kong finished fifth in the first leg in Malaysia two weeks ago and as a result they were able to collect only 7 points. Sri Lanka who became champions in the first leg received 14 points and the 12 points they got for being runner-up here enabled them to clinch the overall title.
In the overall standings Sri Lanka had 26 points followed by South Korea (22) and Hong Kong (21).
South Korea took third place in the second leg after triumphing over Malaysia in the Plate finals. UAE came out winners over Chinese Taipei to secure the Bowl championship and Singapore registered their first win of the series defeating Thailand to grab the Shield championship.
In the womens rugby series, Thailand was too good for Hong Kong.

Heat a big issue at SSC - Chandimal
The heat at the SSC played a big part in two stages for Dinesh Chandimal who carved out his seventh Test hundred for his country and his first against Australia.
When Chandimal came to bat his team was in a crisis having lost four wickets for 24 and Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon threatening to run through the batting.
But with newcomer Dhananjaya de Silva, Chandimal rescued the side with a double century partnership that saw Sri Lanka eventually post a respectable score of 355.
It was a tough time to bat on. I learnt lot of things from my last four innings. I was under pressure before this innings. I didnt play that well the reverse (swinging) ball. Because of that, I changed (my batting) a bit, said Chandimal.
Since weve lost five wickets, I couldnt go for my shots as I usually do. My thinking was to face more balls and get the Aussie bowlers to toil in this heat. Later on I thought of going for few shots when they got tired.
It was also a crucial time. We all know the heat here. If we could keep Australia out in the heat here, we can get the advantage when theyre batting, he said.
However by trying to wear out the Australians on the field the intense heat also got to Chandimal physically.
He suffered from dehydration having batted for almost eight hours and was barely able to answer questions from the media at the end of the day.
Chandimal did not don the wicket-keeping gloves during the Australian innings although he was on the field. Kusal Perera substituted for him behind the wickets.
I was feeling a bit giddy when I came off the field which I think is due to dehydration, Chandimal said.
The heat is really tough here in Colombo, than in Galle and Pallekele. If this is so much difficult for us, its definitely more difficult for them. Well have to make use of that and play well in the next three days. - ST

Geethani finishes 129th in womens marathon
RIO DE JANEIRO, Sunday: Sri Lankas Niluka Geethani Rajasekara finished 129th out of 157 competitors while Kenyan Jelagat Jemima Sumgong bagged the gold medal at the womens marathon of the XXXIst Olympic Games worked off here this morning. Only 133 runners completed the course while 23 of them withdrew during the race due to various reasons and South Africas Irvette Van Zyl did not start.
It was a tall order for the Lankan lass was nowhere near her usual form in clocking three hours, 11 minutes and five seconds. Her timing today was way behind her 2:50.40 at the IAAF World Championships in China last year and career best 2:40.07 at the 2015 Hong Kong Marathon.
Though she was aiming to establish a Sri Lanka record, it was never visible right from the first 10km. Rajasekara took 19 minutes and 25 seconds to complete the first 5km as 135th.
After the first 10 km, Rajasekara descended 144th in 40 minutes and 15 seconds. She had gone down further at 146th at 15km, clocking one hour, two minutes and 42 seconds. She was placed 141st after completing 20 km with a timing of 1:25.09. At the halfway mark of the race, Rajasekara was in the 141st place in 1:30.20 where as Bulgarias Volha Mazuronak was in the lead in 1:12.56.
Rajasekara advanced slightly to be in the 138th place at the 25km mark in 1:48.34. She progressed slowly to 134th place by 30km mark in 2:11.39 and to 133rd place at 35km in 2:36.17 and 131st at 40km in 3:01/08.
Jelagat Jemima Sumgong of Kenya won the gold medal of the event, overcoming a field of several top long distance runners in the world.
She clocked a timing of two hours, 24 minutes and four second to win the gold medal, surviving an exciting finish to push her closest competitor Jepkirui Eunice Kirwa of Bahrain to the second place. But Sumgong was well short of the Olympic record of 2:23.07 by Tiki Gelana of Ethiopia established at the last London 2012 Games.
Kirwa settled for the silver medal position but was only nine seconds behind the winner in 2:24.13. Mare Dibaba of Ethiopia accounted for the bronze medal, finishing just 26 seconds after Sumgong  2:24.30. But after the first 35km point, it was Debaba who was in the lead with a timing of 2:00.31.
A total of 157 female marathon runners, including Sri Lankas Rajasekara, came under the starters order.
USAs 1000th gold
USA womens 4x 100m medley relay victory was the nations 1000th gold medal in summer Olympic Games history. It perfectly teed up Olympic super star Michael Phelps farewell to Rio 2016 Games. Moments after the milestone gold medal in American Olympic history, the USA mens 4x100m medley team, with Phelps doing the butterfly stroke in the third lap, won gold. It was a fitting tribute to Phelps illustrious career.
By helping the USA win the 4x100m medley relay at the Olympic Aquatics Stadium last night, the most decorated Olympian of all time took his final tally to 28 Olympic medals which include a record 23 gold medals.

Usain Bolt, still the worlds fastest man

RIO DE JANEIRO  As befit the king of sprinting and the biggest global star at the Rio Olympics, Usain Bolt of Jamaica held up his index finger, signaling that he was No. 1, during introductions Sunday night as the smitten crowd chanted his name.
Then he proved it again, winning the 100 meters in 9.81 seconds, securing his place as the greatest sprinter of all time and becoming the only man or woman to win the 100 three times and at consecutive Olympics.
His main rival, Justin Gatlin of the United States, the 2004 Olympic champion who later served a suspension for doping and was booed on Sunday, took the silver medal in 9.89 seconds. Andre de Grasse of Canada won the bronze in 9.91.
As Bolt ran down Gatlin in the final meters, he pounded his chest. He then blew kisses to the crowd and carried a toy Olympic mascot around the track, giving it away as a souvenir. Finally, he struck his signature pose, known as To Di World, cocking an elbow and pointing his fingers toward the sky, as if launching an arrow or a lightning bolt.
He is also favored to win a third straight gold medal at 200 meters and yet another as the most vital member of Jamaicas 4x100-meter relay team.
Even an athlete as great as Bolt, though, can be upstaged on rare occasions. That happened Sunday when Wayde Van Niekerk of South Africa set a world record in winning the 400 meters in 43.03 seconds, shattering Michael Johnsons 17-year old record of 43.18.
Running on the outside in lane 8, where he could not see his competitors, Niekerk astonishingly shaved more than four-tenths of a second from his previous career best of 43.48 and more than a second from his seasons fastest race before the Olympic final.
Fairly or unfairly, given the tainted state of track and field due to doping, that performance may bring as much skepticism as celebration.
For Bolt, Sundays victory carried both a sense of celebration and farewell. He will turn 30 next Sunday as the Rio Olympics end. He has said repeatedly that these will be his final Games.
He plans to retire next year after the world track and field championships in London, with one transcendent career goal remaining: to take his world record of 19.19 seconds at 200 meters below the 19-second barrier.
This has got to be the most universal event other than the long jump, David Wallechinsky, the president of the International Society of Olympic Historians, said of Bolts victory in the 100 on Sunday. Everyones tried it at least once in their lives. To be the best in the Olympics three times in something that everyone has done at least once is incredible. When Bolt crossed the line Sunday, it was not with the same astonishment as that night eight years ago at the Beijing Games, when he was new to the public and the 100 and he finished in 9.69 seconds, easing up and celebrating before the tape but still breaking his own world record. How fast he could have run that night, we will never know.
Nor did Sundays performance match the wonder of the 9.58 that Bolt ran a year later to set the current 100 record at the 2009 world track and field championships in Berlin. As with his victory at the 2012 London Games in 9.63 seconds, winning for Bolt is now more about career achievement and historical standing and dominance at the biggest moments than mere startling speed.
He stacks wins as if they were poker chips. Since he became an otherworldly figure with his performances in 2008, Bolt has won 69 of 74 races. His only truly important defeat came with his elimination on a false start in the 100 at the 2011 world track and field championships in Daegu, South Korea.
Bolt has raced little this season, and in recent years, he has become vulnerable to nagging injuries in his back that radiate down the muscles of his legs.
He withdrew on July 1, from the final of the 100 at the Jamaican Olympic trials with a slight tear in his left hamstring muscle. But Jamaicas rules, unlike those of the United States, which require a top-three finish to qualify for the Summer Games, allowed Bolt to be entered in the Rio Games anyway.
Some American sprinters joked at the time that Bolt always seemed to sustain some injury before the Olympics or world championships. Sure, he would be ready for Rio.
Its a tradition, Tyson Gay said.
But sprinting is a lot like boxing in the sense that they are individual and elemental sports, one man against another with his legs or his fists. Sleights, real or perceived, become dramatically exaggerated.
Bolt said he was disappointed by the tame, joking remarks of Gatlin and other Americans, adding: I think they have not learned over the years that the more you talk, the more I will want to beat you. Its one of those things but Im looking forward to it, should be exciting and they will feel my full wrath as always.
In the end, the buildup to Sundays final turned out to be more playful than antagonistic. Bolt held a news conference featuring samba dancers and a Norwegian journalist who broke into a worshipful rap song, saying he hoped that the Jamaican star would again prevail.
In Sundays final, Bolt reacted relatively slowly to the starting gun, as he often does, slower than every competitor but one. He is 6-feet-5 inches, and it can take his body some time to unfurl, like a flag. He also may have grown somewhat cautious after that false start at the 2011 world championships. Once, one false start was permitted. Now, an early lean or even a reaction to the gun in under a tenth of a second, brings automatic disqualification.
But Bolt wins races not in the first 50 meters, but in the second 50 meters. He is so tall, his legs so long, that he takes only 40 or 41 strides over 100 meters, where other sprinters might need 43 or 44 or even 46.
He also holds his top-end speed better than others. No sprinters speed up at the end of a 100-meter race as it appears they do. This is an optical illusion. The winner is not the person shifting into another gear but the one slowing down the slowest.
At the 2015 world track and field championships in Beijing, Gatlin had Bolt beat but leaned too early, wobbled with a kind of swimming motion, and Bolt caught him at the line, winning by a hundredth of a second.
Again on Sunday, Gatlin got a quicker start, but Bolt chased him down.
His legacy depends on what he does with the rest of his life, said Wallechinsky, the Olympic historian, said of Bolt. The best is if he goes around, giving clinics, and travels the world like Muhammad Ali and becomes well known in Africa and Asia and is someone that everybody loves. Or he could just have a good time for the rest of his life.
