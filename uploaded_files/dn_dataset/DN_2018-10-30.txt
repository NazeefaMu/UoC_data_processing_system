Investor confidence should be a priority
General Secretary of the National Economic Council (NEC) Prof.Lalith Samarakoon yesterday said that investor and business confidence in the economy should be a priority.
In an interview with the Daily News, Prof.Samarakoon explained that this political transitional period needed to be managed prudently and that the government should be serious about our credit worthiness.
He added that Growth is a priority as the country recorded the lowest economic growth rate of 3.3% in 2017.
If we lose investor confidence, we will have trouble raising finance to repay a large number of debt that is coming up in the next six years, Prof.Samarakoon said.
The next Budget, expected to be presented in January 2019, he said would be a decisive one and it should strive to maintain fiscal discipline and be growth oriented.
He reiterated that the government resolve the crisis soon and in the next six months focus on stabilizing the economy which is in a precarious situation.
In the next six years, the Professor explained that any government which comes into power would have to look at loan repayments (interest and principal) of USD 4-6 billion each year for the next six years. However our foreign reserves at present stand at USD 7-8 billion and the government would have to look at least increasing it to USD 14 billion to get to a comfortable stage.

All passengers on crashed Indonesian jet feared dead
INDONESIA: All 189 passengers and crew aboard a crashed Indonesian Lion Air jet were likely killed in the accident, the search and rescue agency said Monday, as it announced it had found human remains.
The Boeing-737 MAX, which went into service just months ago, vanished from radar 13 minutes after taking off from Jakarta, plunging into the Java Sea moments after it had asked to be allowed to return to the Indonesian capital.
Websites that display flight data showed the plane speeding up as it suddenly lost altitude in the minutes before it disappeared.
My prediction is that nobody survived because the victims that we found, their bodies were no longer intact and its been hours so it is likely 189 people have died, search and rescue agency operational director Bambang Suryo Aji told reporters.
Some 40 divers are part of about 150 personnel at the scene, authorities said, with the plane in water about 30 to 40 metres deep.
Earlier, video footage apparently filmed at the scene of the crash showed a slick of fuel on the surface of the water and pictures showed what appeared to be an emergency slide and bits of wreckage bearing Lion Airs logo.
The carrier acknowledged that the jet had previously been grounded for unspecified repairs.
The plane had been en route to Pangkal Pinang city, a jumping off point for beach-and-sun seeking tourists on nearby Belitung island, when it dropped out of contact around 6.30 am (2330 GMT).
It was not yet known if there were any foreigners on board.
Images filmed at Pangkal Pinangs main airport showed families of passengers crying and hugging each other, with some yelling Oh God.
This morning he called asking about our youngest son, said a sobbing Ermayati, referring to her 45-year-old husband Muhammed Syafii, who was on board.
Indonesias National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) said there were 178 adult passengers, one child, two infants, two pilots and six cabin crew on board flight JT 610.
The transport ministry had initially said there was a total of 188 people on board.
The finance ministry said around 20 of its employees were on the plane.
Among them were half a dozen colleagues of Sony Setiawan, who was supposed to be on the flight but missed check in due to bad traffic.
I know my friends were on that flight, he told AFP.
Setiawan said he was only informed about his lucky escape after he arrived in Pangkal Pinang on another flight at 9:40 am.
My family was in shock and my mother cried, but I told them I was safe, so I just have to be grateful. Lion Air said the plane had only gone into service in August.
The pilot and co-pilot had more than 11,000 hours of flying time between them and had recent medical checkups and drug testing, it added.
Lion Air CEO Edward Sirait said the plane had an unspecified technical issue fixed in Bali before it was flown back to Jakarta.
Engineers in Jakarta received notes and did another repair before it took off on Monday, Edward Sirait told AFP, calling it normal procedure.
US-based Boeing said it was deeply saddened by news of the crash.
Boeing, just days out from its first commercial delivery of the 737 MAX in May last year, reportedly suspended its release due to an engine issue, according to airline safety and product review site airlineratings.com.
It said the engines were a product of a joint venture between US-based General Electric and Frances Safran Aircraft Engines.
Earlier this year, Lion Air announced it was buying 50 Boeing 737 MAX 10 jets for $6.24 billion.
Indonesias air travel industry is booming, with the number of domestic passengers growing significantly over the past decade, but it has acquired a reputation for poor regulation and its airlines had once been banned from US and European airspace.
In August 2015, a commercial passenger aircraft operated by Indonesian carrier Trigana crashed in Papua due to bad weather, killing all 54 people on board. In 2014, poor maintenance and the pilots inadequate response was blamed for the crash of an AirAsia plane crashed with the loss of 162 lives. - AFP
Indonesian rescuers have found passengers belongings and debris, but are yet to locate the main body of the plane.

Babar, Shadab help Pakistan whitewash Australia
DUBAI, Sunday - Opener Babar Azam struck a half-century and leg-spinner Shadab Khan claimed three wickets as Pakistan secured a 3-0 T20 series whitewash over Australia with a 33-run victory in Dubai on Sunday.
Azam's 40-ball 50 lifted Pakistan to another challenging total of 150-5 before Shadab's 3-19 helped bowl Australia out for 117 in 19.1 overs.
It is Pakistan's first-ever whitewash against Australia in a limited-over series and their 10th series win under Sarfraz Ahmed since he took over as captain in September 2016.
Pakistan justified their world-number-one ranking in the shortest format of the game, following a 66-run thrashing in Abu Dhabi with an 11-run win in Dubai.
Australia's batting line-up never recovered from being bowled out for 89 in the first game.
Only Mitchell Marsh (21), Ben McDermott (21) and Alex Carey (20) looked like getting big scores on Sunday against a varied Pakistan attack.
Carey, promoted to open the innings, smashed two fours and two sixes in Imad Wasim's first over of the innings but they lost wickets at regular intervals.
Skipper Aaron Finch failed yet again, scoring only one while Chris Lynn (15) and Glenn Maxwell (four) also inflicted little damage as seamer Hasan Ali finished with 2-14.
Sarfraz said the series win was a reward for hard work.
I would say that all the boys have worked hard in all facets, the result is just the reward, said Sarfraz.
Whoever has got an opportunity has done well. We wanted to carry forward the momentum to the New Zealand series, the way we bowled and took our catches was superb tonight.
WE HAD OUR CHANCES
Finch admitted it was disappointing to come up so short when chasing 151 to win.
We had our chances in all three games, said Finch. You back yourself while chasing under 150, you back your batsmen to get the side over the line but it didn't happen.
Our bowling was very impressive all series, keeping them to below 150 was great. We're looking forward to a tough series against South Africa (at home).
Earlier, Azam scored his second fifty of the series after the hosts had won the toss and batted.
Azam and Sahibzada Farhan gave Pakistan an excellent start -- their opening stand of 99 their highest against Australia in T20 internationals -- in 12.5 overs, but Pakistan could not capitalise on that start.
Farhan, dismissed for a first-ball duck in his only previous match against Australia in Harare in July, hit a 38-ball 39.
But after the openers, only Mohammad Hafeez managed to score freely during his 20-ball 32 not out. Shoaib Malik scored 18 and became the second-highest run-scorer in T20 international history, passing New Zealand's Brendon McCullum.
Another New Zealander Martin Guptill is at the top of the charts with 2,271 runs in 75 matches -- 118 more than Malik.
Pakistan next play New Zealand in three Twenty20 internationals, three ODIs and three Tests, starting with the first Twenty20 in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday. - AFP

Ball-tampering report slams arrogant Cricket Australia culture
MELBOURNE, Monday : A review into a ball-tampering scandal has condemned an arrogant and controlling culture at Cricket Australia that led to players cheating in pursuit of victory.
The independent review by the Sydney-based Ethics Centre accused Cricket Australia (CA) of only paying lip service to the spirit of the game, leaving players without any moral guidance.
Responsibility for that larger picture lies with CA and not just the players held directly responsible for the appalling incident at Newlands, it said.
The scandal involved Australian players using sandpaper to alter the flight of the ball in a Test match against South Africa last March at Cape Towns Newlands Stadium.
Coach Darren Lehmann quit in the wake of the controversy and then-captain Steve Smith, deputy David Warner and batsman Cameron Bancroft were banned from the game. The scandal also claimed the scalps of CA chief executive James Sutherland and team performance boss Pat Howard.
CA is perceived to say one thing and do another. The most common description of CA is as arrogant and controlling, the review said.  AFP

Fine line between politicians and officials
As public officials we have to work with ministers of various temperaments and behaviours. One incident comes to my mind when serving in the Department of Public Works (PWD) where the Minister was Cholamondalay Gunawardena. When he took up office, I had the opportunity to work closely with him, as I was handling the subject of improvements to minor roads. This was the main subject of all Members of Parliament to meet the Minister to get minor roads developed in their electorates.
Over our first encounter, the minister told me: I know you are not a supporter of my political party [LSSP], but that does not anyway concern me. But when I want something done, you should come out with any problem why my order cannot be carried out and then we will discuss and solve and if not possible  drop it. That was an encouragement for me to be honest with him and speak out.
Once an MP from an upcountry electorate met the minister and wanted a village road to be taken over to the PWD. I told him that there is no provision in the Thoroughfare Ordinance for the PWD to takeover, unless the Village Council concerned makes a request. The problem here was that the VC was under UNP administration and the MP was insisting, perhaps prestige. At this time of discussion, in walked Dr Colvin R de Silva. Hailing him, the minister said: Here comes the legal luminary, to which Dr Colvin said: Here is your minister whose name sounds different to its spelling - Spelt Cholomondalay but sounds Chomley. After this hilarious introduction, he was told of the problem we were facing. He took the Ordinance, which I had and after going through, he said: Your official is right. Then he gave a solution, and that was to write to the Chairman of the VC concerned saying if the road is not handed over, that the PWD will get the Ministers authority to compulsorily take over.
When I said there was no such provision, he smiled and said that is another ruse. You try it. When I told this to the Director PWD, he said he would not sign such an illegal letter. However, I rang the Executive Engineer of the area and explained the situation. I suggested to him to meet the Chairman and tell him to say to the villagers that he is handing over the road to the PWD, for metalling and tarring and then the credit would go to him.
That worked, and the road was taken over with the engineer himself had confirmed to the villagers that the work is undertaken on the request of the Chairman.
When I showed the letter of consent of the Chairman, he was delighted and thanked me and said: Thats how we should work.
I have worked closely with Ministers and all of them were very understanding and accepted the public officers views, except the last I had to work.

To maintain quality of the city:
Colombo needs good development plans
Colombo is in need of better and controlled development plans to maintain the quality of the city, a senior official representing the local architecture industry said.
It was also suggested that Sri Lanka needs to have a proper policy towards the construction industry, aimed at creating an efficient construction industry, serving the national development needs through regulation, standardization, capacity building and facilitation.
If we want to maintain the quality of the Colombo city, we must control the development. Hence, we need to have a controlled development plan to continue Colombos city status and also to develop other cities across the country, President of Sri Lanka Institute of Architects D.H Wijewardene told at the Foxhouze Architecture Xtudio conference, held in Colombo yesterday.
Stressing the need to get the local stakeholders together to develop the industry, he said that it is also essential to improve the knowledge base of the industry to achieve set industry targets in the near future.Highlighting that Sri Lankan architects are not fully involved in ongoing or upcoming development projects, particularly in condominium development and hotel projects in Sri Lanka, Wijewardene said; We have seen Sri Lankan architects who have built massive airports in Oman. Unfortunately our second airport was not designed by us.
We have capable people waiting to be part of development process in Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, Ranjith Gunatilleke, President of Chamber of Construction Industry addressing the event said that local architects are bit sidelined in the countrys new development process and their participation in the local construction industry activities is limited and getting deteriorated.
He also stressed that at least some percentage of upcoming construction projects should come to Sri Lankan industry players to redress this issue. In addition to that, he said construction cost per unit and the cost of architects in Sri Lanka is very much higher than regional peers and according to him, construction cost per unit in Sri Lanka is supposed to be higher than countries such as Singapore, Dubai and India.
Gunatilleke also noted that the construction of 60-70 storeyed buildings wouldnt go with the Colombo Skyline and also raised concern over the capability and facilities of fire department and other related organisations to maintain fire and safety aspects of these high rise buildings.
I think the construction of 30 storeyed buildings would be nice for the Colombo city, Gunatilleke said.

Colombo Stock Exchange regains Positive momentum
Colombo Stock Exchanges main index, The All Share Price index kept up the positive momentum and went up 112.22 points or 1.92 percent closing in the 5944.18 mark.
Meanwhile the S&P SL20 index too gained 61.26 points or 2.04 percent closing in the 3058.59 mark following the current political situation in the country.
The market closed yesterday with a share volume of 66,036,982 and a turnover of 4,166,902,471.20.
Market analysts said that this may be due to sudden and unexpected change in the countrys political climate. This may last for more time provided the current uncertainty improves, he said.
Meanwhile Colombo District Chamber of Commerce, Dr. Amila Kankanamge said that the speech made by President Maithripala Sirisena on Monday explaining in detail as to how and why the new Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was appointed and the reason he decided to do so too has given a confident factor for them to move forward in a more positive manner.
This is what is been reflected in the Colombo Stock Exchange in the last two days, he said.
Meanwhile the Chamber of Commerce in a release said, We request the political authorities to resolve issues through the democratically established Institutions as early as possible. We appeal to the political Parties to ensure that law and order prevails and that danger to the life and property of citizens is prevented.
All parties should act in the best interests of our country, our people and the national economy. (SS)

Federer claims 99th ATP title with crazy Basel triumph
BASEL, Switzerland, Sunday - Roger Federer claimed his 99th career ATP Tour title on Sunday but he had to battle to defeat Romanian qualifier Marius Copil 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 in the Swiss Indoors final at Basel.
The top seed claimed his ninth trophy at his home event as he overcame an inspired opponent who took the lead early in each set but was pegged back by the 20-time Grand Slam champion.
Federer will now aim to win number 100 by the end of the season.Its been a magical week for me, a dream run for me, Federer said, prior to moving onto his traditional post-final pizza party with ballkids -- of which he was one here two decades ago.
Nine (titles) is a huge number for me. winning that many times here is crazy. Its been a major week for me in terms of records. Federer won his 20th straight match at the tournament and has played in 12 straight Basel finals.
This was almost a turnaround week for me, the Swiss legend said.
Maybe I had to win through fighting. maybe it was different than some of my past victories.
But winning is fun, winning gives you confidence. Thats what I need if I want to do well in London, to do my best there.
But for me now its about winning here, I dont care about anything else. It means the world to me. Im happy to win in front of my home crowd. The 93rd-ranked Copil was competing in the biggest match of his life after emerging from qualifying. But after knocking out sixth seed Marin Cilic and backing it up by defeating third seed Alexander Zverev in the last four, the Romanian found himself facing the king of the court in the final.
I played quite good tennis, it was an amazing week, he said.
Ive gained a a lot of confidence in myself. I know I can play at a high level and keep it up with the great players.
Id love to see now what kind of results I can have - but it went his way today, this is how it ended.Victory was the 37-year-old Federers 71st at the event. He will be aiming to complete his century at the ATP Finals in London, which starts in a fortnights time, but has yet to announce if he will travel to Paris for next weeks final Masters event of the season, where he last played in 2015.
Copil began the match with a break in the third game but lost it in the sixth as Federer levelled the opening set.
As the first set went to a tie-break, Federer needed three set points to take the lead as his opponent returned long. Copil again showed his steel with an early break in the second set before Federer made another fightback with an overhead winner to break back in the seventh game.
The top seed grabbed a second break, with the Swiss serving out victory a game later on his first match point.
The title was the fourth this season for Federer, after the Australian Open, Rotterdam and Stuttgart.  AFP

Proper investigation should be conducted immediately on how the former Health Ministers henchmen, including a male nurse, acquired lands worth over Rs. 150 million in Nugegoda and went on foreign tours using state funds, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the former Health Minister gave regular foreign tours to his henchmen in NGOs naming them as trade union leaders.
He monthly pumped over Rs. 250 million to the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital, which is still a private hospital. This should be investigated, Dr. Aluthge said.
The former Health Minister engaged in acts of corruption and malpractice when granting tenders, stating that he reduced drug prices. He gave free lenses and stents creating a monopoly in the market, which gave a huge profit to one specific private company.
The former Health Minister gained direct and indirect benefits by violating the Medical Ordinance and ignoring the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), Dr. Aluthge said.
Those acts of corruption and malpractice of the former Health Minister need to be investigated properly as soon as possible before the evidence disappears, he said.

A Star is Born
Gorgeous Heartbreak
A Star Is Born may seem a story Hollywood keeps telling but there is something new in this one which makes it is such a great movie. Produced and directed by Bradley Cooper and written by Cooper, Eric Roth and Will Fetters, it stars Cooper, Lady Gaga, Andrew Dice Clay, Dave Chappelle, and Sam Elliott. This 2018 American musical romantic drama relates the story of two lovers on dramatically differing paths: a famous man whos furiously racing to the bottom and a woman whos soaring to the top. The movie wrings tears from its romance while it also depicts perverse fantasy about men, women, love and sacrifice.
The movie takes place in a contemporary music world which is exciting, suffocating and crowded with fans and their demands and crushing performance of the celebrity. A country-rock musician Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) who, when the movie begins, is performing obviously wasted and is close to ruining. Adrift on an ocean of booze, one he routinely spikes with pills one night he stumbles into a Drag club for more booze. He then meets a singer with a voice that can thunder, Ally Campana (Lady Gaga) where she sings after her waitress shifts. There he watches Ally belt out the Edith Piaf standard La Vie en Rose, with her arched artificial brows. Soon after Jack and Ally meet, he peels off one of her fake brows suggesting that he sees the real her and wants the world to do so as well. Cooper understands that casting of Lady Gaga, whose disarming, naturalistic presence is crucial to the movies force. Thus the post-Madonna pop artist known for her elaborate stagecraft and costumes has been stripped down here with her mask removed. It brings you closer to her and makes Ally genuine and authentic.
When Ally and Jack look at each other, you are not only watching two people fall in love but also watching a director guiding and creating his star as life ooze into fiction. Soon Ally becomes Jacks safe harbor, taking on the roles of lover, partner, muse, ideal.
Thats a heavy burden to Ally but she is one of lifes chin-up survivors, with a wayward mother and a loving, larger-than-life father, Lorenzo, who runs a limo business out of their Los Angeles home, where his male colleagues and their boisterous camaraderie fill her house, Ally is accustomed to navigating around men larger than she is, elbowing past them to be seen and heard.
As Jack brings Ally onstage and then on tour, she eventually goes solo, becoming a star whose ascent is shadowed by his decline. The concert scenes of Jack and Ally performing in the movie are energetic but personal. The music mixes standards with new songs some written by Cooper, Lukas Nelson and Lady Gaga whose electric singing can throttle and express passions and feelings far better than her dialogues.
Like in many other movies, Cooper fleshes out Jacks past and explains why Jack drinks. Cooper spends more time on the storys male lead and focuses on Jack how he scrapes bottom, goes into recovery, share Jacks unease with Allys stardom, particularly after she connects with a manager and finally watches Ally putting on the mask that Cooper has removed from Lady Gaga, suggesting that unlike Jacks her art is less than pure.
Jack doesnt just help turn Ally into a star, giving her the big break, though damaged himself, he becomes her security allowing her to become a greater artist. `A Star Is Born is also about a woman whose ambitions are equal to those of any man and a woman who steadily rises as she weeps and sings toward fabulous self and sovereignty.
A Star is Born is looking to dominate this years Oscar race for best original song.

Hamilton joins Fangio with surreal fifth world title
MEXICO CITY, Sunday: Lewis Hamilton claimed his fifth drivers world championship on Sunday to draw level with Juan Manuel Fangio in the Formula One record books when he finished fourth behind a victorious Max Verstappen in the Mexican Grand Prix.
Hamiltons success  the third time he has taken the title without finishing on the race podium  elevated him to a supreme club alongside Fangio with only seven-time champion Michael Schumacher ahead of him.
He was adding the 2018 crown to his championship wins in 2008, 2014, 2015 and 2017.
The 33-year-old Britons only remaining championship rival Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari, who needed a victory, with Hamilton outside the top seven, to keep his hopes alive, finished second.
He celebrated by executing doughnut wheel spins for the cheering crowd before leaping out of his car and into the arms of his team.
After being congratulated by Vettel, Hamilton said: Its a very strange feeling right now.
After surviving what turned into a battle of attrition at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez he added: It was a horrible race I really dont know what happened.
We were struggling both Valtteri (Bottas) and I and we had to just hang on and bring the car home.
SURREAL
Ive been with Mercedes since I was 13 and to complete this, when Fangio had done it with Mercedes, is an incredible feeling and it is very surreal to me at the moment.
I just feel very very humble, of course I dreamed about this but I never thought Id be standing here as a five-time champion.
Four-time champion Vettel heaped praise on his rival.
It is not easy today but well deserved for him and I want to congratulate Lewis. They did a superb job all year. We need to stand there, accept that and send congratulations. We would have liked to have hung in there longer, but it was not to be.
Reflecting on his season Hamilton added: It has been the toughest year physically, mentally and personally with everything Im committed to, but I have amazing support.
Mercedes and my team have just been the most incredible unit and worked to raise the bar. In my mind it is just another day of fighting and I have more races to win, it is not over.
In my mind I have to work, go to the debrief and try to win in Brazil.
Hamilton, who started third on the grid, struggled with chronic tyre-wear after making a strong start in his Mercedes and settled for a cautious cruise to the title without a podium finish.
Verstappen, upstaged by his Red Bull team-mate Daniel Ricciardo in qualifying on Saturday, came home 17.108 seconds ahead of Vettel after the luckless Australian pole-sitter retired with nine laps remaining.
I didnt sleep very well last night, said Verstappen.
I was very determined to win and weve done that  we had the right tyres and the car was working very well
It was a shame to lose Daniel. We wanted two of us on the podium. A party tonight No, Im going home!
A puff of smoke signalled an engine failure and his eighth Did Not Finish (DNF) of the season while his 21-year-old Dutch tyro team-mate secured a repeat of his 2017 triumph, his second win this season and the fifth of his career.
Vettels Ferrari team-mate Kimi Raikkonen came home third ahead of Hamilton and his Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas.
Nico Hulkenberg was sixth for Renault ahead of Charles Leclerc of Sauber, Stoffel Vandoorne of McLaren, Marcus Ericsson in the second Sauber and Pierre Gasly of Toro Rosso.
KEEP PUSHING
For Ferrari, it was a first double podium success in Mexico since 1990 with Alain Prost and Nigel Mansell.
Vettel for one wants Hamilton back as strong as ever in 2019.
I told him to keep pushing for next year, as I need him good to fight him again, said the German, who with Raikkonen is aiming now to deliver the constructors title to Ferrari in the last two races.  AFP

Head over heels for dames on two wheels!
The motorcycle is a machismo machine foremost. The older ones have chunks of devices sticking out all over the place, bits of motor showing there, tubes here, wires there, an unmistakable gas tank bloating out like a pot-bellied male slob exposing himself on the beach.
There is a great barroom-barroom bellow emitted from the engine reminiscent of the fictional bogeyman Bull McCorbys infuriated roar when a hammer hits his thumb. The motorcycle is decidedly a muscular masculine machine built essentially for motorcycle guys. The motorcycle guys will always ride motorcycles. Then there are the rest of us. We are not motorcycle guys.
The point I am trying to make is that when compared with motorbikes the motor scooter is much more about the humans astride it - the rider and passenger - and particularly so when they are women. In the case of both scooters and mopeds controls are simple and easy to use. The noise output is subdued, and the engine, fluids, fuel tank and wiring are all obscured behind designer panels. It is essentially designed to both suit and resemble the feminine form.
Besides, the noisy, oily, hot, smelly, metallic power of the machine is not a part of the scooter riding experience. Instead, the scooter is more on the lines of an elegant, curvaceous woman whose looks, sound and feel is dictated not by the machine below but by the aesthetics and ergonomics of the human interface above. And they come in colourful shades of feminine pink, lemon, mauve and yellow.
It is nothing short of a transportation revolution in Sri Lankas conservative middle class society, where many women dont have to depend on husbands or brothers to shepherd them around. Thanks to the scooter they have realised that the convenient and most elegant way to commute is to scoot.
Where the motor scooter is the dominant form of transportation, it becomes the equaliser, the emancipator, the symbol of womens liberation. The image and flexibility of the motor scooter frees them from the stereotypical role played by vehicles in a male-dominated society. While a lady on a motorcycle tends to be at least anomalous, the motor scooter steps up to the plate with elegance and grace.
At present, scooters for girls are increasingly becoming the most viable option to commute. This is in direct relation to the financial capabilities within our country. A car may not be a luxury item, but it sure is treated as such here because of the high cost of owning one. On the other hand owning a two-wheeler is much more cost effective. Vroom... and they are off zigzagging through traffic. Middle class women all over the country are no longer willing to submit to the rigours and constraints of suburban or city bus rides. They are increasingly taking to mopeds and scooters and enjoying the new-found feeling of freedom and convenience.
With a motorcycle, you have to swing your leg over the seat, not very becoming for a demure dame. But on a scooter, you can sit on it like a chair. It's very convenient and dignified for women, especially for those who wear skirts, dresses or even saris and use the machine to commute to and from work. Scooters are looking pretty sharp these days. The newer models look like something from out of The Jetsons.
The ones I know have formed the Women on Wheels club characterised by a certain rebellious flavour. But the problem is that they are often stalked and ridiculed by Highway Casanovas. Behind their feminine charms and demure looks, some of these scooter women are as tough as the brawny men on big bikes. And they are no pushovers when it comes to bandying words with incurable skirt-chasers.
Take the case of Brenda confronted by the old guy at the wheel of a swank BMW. He lowered his power shutter, poked his head out much like a leering tortoise in search of a suitable mate. He then shot the hackneyed line: Why, hello! So we meet again! Long time no see, no Brenda fired back: I never forget a face, but in your case I'll be glad to make an exception. The light turned green and so did the guys eyes as she shot through a narrow opening leaving the old lecher stranded.
But the man appeared persistent. He came alongside her at the next traffic light ogled her with unmitigated lechery and exclaimed: Hey beautiful, how about a hot date with a real tiger Brenda shot him a contemptuous stare and quipped: So you think you are a big cat with nine lives. Mess with me and youll have none! Quite undeterred the man followed her to the next traffic light. He asked quite boldly: How about you and I hitting the hot spots.
Brenda answered with cool composure: Sorry I dont date outside my species. But the old reprobate was relentless in his pursuit and at the final stop made a bold pitch: Hey cutie. How about it If you have the time I have the money and the inclination. Brenda by now had come to the end of her tether.
She back-pedalled her scooter to the rear of his gleaming luxury vehicle and announced loudly:  I may be a cutie, but mess with me and Ill kick your bootie! With that she edged closer to his vehicle and gave its boot a hefty kick with the heel of her shoe. The old road Romeo took off like greased lightning.
Twin sisters Mali and Lali were on their mauve scooter when another old greying leering wolf parked alongside and shot his line: Where have you girls been all my life Pillion rider Lali took one glance at him and said, For your first half of it, we probably werent born yet, grandpa.
In another instance two young bucks sidled up to them in their souped up racer saying: Hi girls! Havent we met before Lali smiled sweetly before responding acerbically: Yes we are both doctors at the VD clinic!
Then there were the two motorcyclists with pillion riders who sandwiched Brenda at a traffic light and made their teasing remarks. They followed her. She stopped, parked her scooter. It was quite revealing when she divested herself of the helmet. They realised instantly that as in her case most women are not always as young or pretty as they are painted. The bikers mysteriously scooted.
Recounting the incident Brenda laughed uproariously saying. Only when I took off my helmet did they realise I possessed a body like Baywatch, and a face like Crimewatch!

Horror show
The upcoming independent horror film by High School Junkies, The Summoning, made its premiere in Sri Lanka at the National Film Corporation, Colombo on October 26 at 6.30 pm.
Conceived late last year as a quick skit for Halloween 2017, the film has become one of the most challenging projects undertaken by the team to date.
The Summoning revolves around a group of four friends who discover an ancient sance table and inadvertently summon an entity that seeks its own vengeance. The short film pays homage to the Raimi-era of horror whilst putting a spin on the recent trend of Ouija boards.
The short film was shot in Negombo over four nights whilst the post-production spanned over four months. The Director, who was not so fond of the genre at the outset, spent months watching, learning and absorbing the quintessential elements of horror factor from renowned movies  paving the way to the production of a film on par with a Hollywood Blockbuster.
Led by Akash Sk, his team, the High School Junkies gained reputation in 2017 for their short film EIDETIC, which became the first Sri Lankan film to be screened at the San Diego Comic-Con. EIDETIC was also screened at multiple film festivals worldwide including Europes largest independent festival, Raindance Film Festival.
Their success with Eidetic inspired Akash to take the film to Los Angeles, United States in July where it was screened to a few producers and was met with rave reviews.
The Summoning features expert voices: David Worth, Cinematographer in two Clint Eastwood films, who made a key contribution to the films technical aspects as an Advisor and Mentor; and Ruwanga Samath, the Sri Lankan born LA bred composer of Fast Five, who assumed the role of Executive Producer of The Summoning upon seeing its final production.
A trailer of the film is available for preview at facebook.com/highschooljunkies. The Summoning will be released online on October 31 via YouTube.

IBM to acquire software company Red Hat for us $34 bn.
IBM Corp said it had agreed to acquire U.S. software company Red Hat Inc for $34 billion, including debt, as it seeks to diversify its technology hardware and consulting business into higher-margin products and services.
The transaction is by far IBMs biggest acquisition. It underscores IBM chief executive Ginni Romettys efforts to expand the companys subscription-based software offerings, as it faces slowing software sales and waning demand for mainframe servers.
The acquisition of Red Hat is a game-changer ... IBM will become the worlds No. 1 hybrid cloud provider, offering companies the only open cloud solution that will unlock the full value of the cloud for their businesses, Rometty said in a statement.
IBM, which has a market capitalization of $114 billion, will pay $190 per share in cash for Red Hat, a 62 percent premium to Fridays closing share price.
Founded in 1993, Red Hat specializes in Linux operating systems, the most popular type of open-source software, which was developed as an alternative to proprietary software made by Microsoft Corp.
Headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, Red Hat charges fees to its corporate customers for custom features, maintenance and technical support, offering IBM a lucrative source of subscription revenue. (chinadaily.com)

JO has numbers to form govt - Prasanna Ranatunga
Since the required Parliamentary majority is available, the Joint Opposition has no doubt about the formation of a government under the leadership of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga said.
The damage caused to the country by the UNP by steering it into a grave economic crisis during last three years could not be considered minimal. Only a government led by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa is able to rescue the country from the current economic plight, he said.
Ranatunga was speaking to a group of Joint Opposition activists at a meeting in Minuwangoda yesterday. The ending of UNP rule, which sent war heroes to the gallows, robbed the Treasury and damaged national security was a great victory achieved by the people, he said.
Ranatunga said they were always in the forefront of the movement to make Mahinda Rajapaksa the Prime Minister.
They had asked the people to ensure their victory at the local government election pledging to make Mahinda Rajapaksa the Prime Minister and now they had fulfilled that pledge.
The time has come to serve the people by ushering in development and uplifting the countrys economy.
The UNP which treated the alleged plot to assassinate President Maithripala Siripala and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa lightly tried to divide the country by bringing in a new constitution. Today all those conspiracies have been defeated, Ranatunga said.

So, you want to start-up and develop a small business  Part 08:
Mastering the art of keeping your start-up costs low
Now its time we get down to the nitty-gritty. Having come up with an idea that works for you - financially, emotionally, intellectually, marketwise, (or however else you define it) - the next step is to figure out what it will actually cost to start that business and what level of sales you will need to achieve to sustain it.
Figuring out your start-up costs and potential sales is a matter of making educated assumptions. Last week, we suggested that you do a lot of research, much of which will come in handy here. So, what will it cost to start a business like the one you visualize
The numbers you input here will help you figure out how much money you will need and can make, and they will apply equally to the business plan that you will write (explained next week). Remember, you will incur additional expenses when starting a business from scratch.
One of the most common causes of new business failures is not having enough cash to meet expenses, especially in the first 6-12 months of starting. But if you identify and plan for these costs, this is less likely to happen. You can use our guide to help calculate your start-up costs so you can avoid as many surprises as possible
Expenses
Remember - some of these expenses will not be encountered again - the cost of incorporation, security deposits, that sort of thing. Others are ongoing expenses - marketing materials, rent, and so on.
Calculating these costs is a four-step process. The first three steps help you understand how much money you will need for initial start-up costs, the purchase of assets, and monthly expenses. The fourth step helps you understand your potential sales and how much money you will need to break- even and earn a profit.
As you calculate these expenses, a word of caution is in order: be conservative, both in your analysis and when it comes time to actually purchase these things. Cash is the lifeblood of your business, but especially your new business. And, as a new business, you wont have the sales or experience to create a steady cash flow to replace what you will be spending.
Dont blow it. Dont spend too much. Buy used. Buy from bargain offers. Horde your preciouscapital. Richard Branson once said: A business has to be involving, it has to be fun, and it has to exercise your creative instincts. Always remember it.
Step 1: Calculating Start-up Expenses
Put a realistic figure next to each category: (1) Creating your legal structure (sole proprietorship, partnership,or limited liability company): (2) Accountant: (3) Building out the space, decorating, and remodelling: (4) Licenses and permits: (5) Stationery and logos: (6) Marketing and sales materials: (7) First months rent and security deposit: (8) Insurance: (9) Telephone and utility deposits: (10) Signs: (11) Internet and website: (12) Others:
(Word of advice about the website! Your website is often the first thing customers will see, and first impressions are everything. There are some good platforms that make building your own site easy, or you may want to pay a professional to take care of it. Either way, site expenses will include the following: Website design/branding, Hosting fees, any software needed and Domain name.
A clean, professional website that is easy to navigate is worth every cent spent.If you do hire a professional, find one who can provide a package deal that includes site design, content, and SEO (Search Engine Optimization). Even if you start with a smaller package, it will be easier to add SEO later with a company youve already been working with.)
Step 2: Purchasing Assets
What kinds of assets will you need in order to open your doors Real estate: Furniture and fixtures: Equipment and machinery: Vehicles: Inventory: Supplies: Others:
Step 3: Ongoing monthly expenses
Keep addingand yes, these numbers can be daunting. But the fact is, starting a business is a fairly expensive proposition. That is why it is so important to be smart and frugal.
In this section, you will calculate what it is going to cost to run your business in a typical month. Rent: Utilities: Payroll: Owners draw: Supplies: Insurance: Transportation: Legal and accounting: Advertising and marketing: Inventory: Taxes: Debt repayment: Working capital: Others:
Total the ongoing monthly expenses up and multiply the last total by 6. That will tell you how much money you need to run the business for six months. Then, add it to the totals calculated in Steps 1 and 2. This will tell you how much money you need to open your doors and to stay in business for six months.
It isideal to have a minimum of six months working capital in the bank before you start.
Example
Let us work out a simple example.
Heres an example: Suppose you want to open up a small Pizza Parlour
Step 1. Total start-up expenses: Rs. 1,100,000
Step 2. Assets to be purchased: Rs. 750,000
Step 3. Ongoing monthly expenses: Rs 500,000
Start, then, by multiplying the ongoing monthly expenses total (Step 3) by 6 - even that is optimistic, as it will likely be more than six months before your revenues will be consistent. The total is Rs, 3,000,000. Adding Rs. 1,100,000 and Rs. 750,000 (Steps 1 and 2) to that number, we see that your Pizza Parlour should ideally have Rs. 4,850,000 to get up and running.
Note that we said ideally. Not all businesses will have six months worth of working capital in the bank before they open their doors. Although six months worth is ideal, life and business are not always ideal, and if you will have less than that, it is still possible to make a go of it - it will just be more difficult.
Starting a new business is challenging enough, but having a cash crunch from the get-go makes it that much harder. The six-month figure is intended to give you enough of a cushion to get started, open your doors, create some sales, and move forward.
Now the question is, how much pizza you need to sell to make a profit
Step 4: Your previous research will tell you how much you can expect to make in this business. The numbers calculated in the preceding steps (especially ongoing monthly expenses) will give you a break-even threshold of sales that you need to achieve.
Your Pizza, for example, must gross at least Rs. 500,000 a month to break even. That means you must earn Rs. 15,667 a day. If an average pizza dinner is, say, Rs.1500, then you must serve at least 11 customers a day to break even. Anything above that figure is profit that can be earmarked initially to pay off the start-up costs.
Although 11 orders a day may seem doable, it will likely take a while for the restaurant to achieve that level of sales. Building a name and reputation takes time. It is far more difficult and expensive to create a new customer than it is to keep an existing one; the problem for new businesses is, of course, that they have no existing customers, so all customers take effort. This simple example assumes that all things remain stable during the six months and you have healthy profit margins.
Having enough money in the bank before you start means that you will have the time necessary to build and grow your start-up. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that it will take at least six months before you, or any business, begins to make a consistent profit.
Finding the money
In our example, your Pizza Parlour should have almost Rs. 500,000 in the bank before the doors open. Wherewill you find that kind of money The next instalment will explain how to write a business plan that can get you the funding you need, and laterwe will show you where to shop that plan. The money is there; you just need to know where to look.
As the final point, we re-emphasise: it will be the cashflow, not profits, that make or break your business.Even if you make a healthy margin, if you run out of cash, you cant pay your bills. Even if you are feeling confident about your start-up costs by looking at your financials with a critical (and open) eye doesnt stop there. Its important to ensure that as you get on with running your business your costs dont creep up.

Mitra Innovation engages in talks with VCCI
British trade delegates and founders of Mitra Innovation, Dammika Ganegama, Managing Director of Mitra Innovation and Vice President Sri Lanka Australia Chamber of Commerce, and Dr. Ashok Suppiah, CEO Mitra Innovation and ex-founding member of $1B Virtusa Corp (NASDAQ: VRTU), met with leaders of the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Nguyen Van Hai, Deputy Director General International Relations Department VCCI, and Dr. Doan Duy Khuong, Vice Executive President of the VCCI.
Mitra Innovation founders and VCCI leaders discussed alliances between the VCCI and Mitra Innovation in the development and delivery of modern day computing technology - to assist in the upliftment of urban and rural agriculture.
The novel technology concept - termed AgriTech - is aimed at employing invaluable cloud computing, internet of things, data lakes and predictive analytics to deliver real value for farmers in the management of crops, overall food security of the nation and increase crop yield.
Vietnam is one the fastest growing economies in the world today. With the South China Sea to its western and south western borders, Vietnam enjoys friendly relations with neighbouring Laos, Cambodia and China. Vietnam is home to over nearly 97 million people and boasts a steady 7% GDP growth rate over the past few years.
The Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry promotes business alliances between countries. During the meeting with the Vice President of VCCI, Mitra Innovation founders discussed the steady improvement of trade between England, Sri Lanka and Vietnam. The VCCI will explore pathways to bringing Mitra Innovations ICT innovation expertise to Vietnamese farmers and agricultural industry, and will foster alliances with local Vietnamese partners. The VCCI also expressed their intentions to invest in education, infrastructure and welfare and were seeking assistance in technologies relating to farming and agriculture. Both parties talked about implementing advanced modern technologies for the further improvement of Vietnams agricultural industries.
Vietnam is considered one of the most picturesque countries and is considered a highly fertile land source for crops such as rice, corn, cassava, sweet potatoes, nuts, banana, coconut, citrus, coffee, tea, rubber and a variety of fruit produce such as banana, orange, mango, jack-fruit too are easily found on the tropical nation.
Vietnamese farmers also cultivate arca palms, betel peppers and mulberry bushes - for the production of silk. Vietnam exports produce of the rich seas that border the nation. Major seafood exports are shrimp, squid, crab and lobster. There are also a number of freshwater fisheries and commercial shrimp farms to Vietnams advantage.
During the meeting, Mitra Innovation founders discussed the possibilities that Mitra Innovation can help Vietnamese farmers and agriculture. Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of Mitra Innovation - Ashok Suppiah explained with the availability of modern cloud computing technologies, it is possible to create and implement intelligent farming solutions - consisting of sensors - that can help farmers by detecting and recommending early preventive action against pests in the soil, or even prevent the spread of infectious diseases in livestock by analysing samples and recommending prescriptive actions. Vietnam is one of the top three global coffee exporters, with tea and rubber production also being major export revenue earners to the country.
Managing Director and co-founder of Mitra Innovation, Dammika Ganegama said, We are delighted to meet with the VCCI and are looking to share our innovative ICT knowledge with farming communities in Vietnam. We hope to bring AgriTech to Vietnam in a consolidated effort to improve food security to the nation, improve harvests and establish agriculture and fisheries as a major export earner to Vietnam. Mitra Innovation looks forward to working with the Government of Vietnam in the innovations and agricultural spaces.

Never  unprepared
The breakfast is brief. Immediately following breakfast, the cadets were straight back into training. Straight-bodied, these cadets showed the prowess of discipline and agility. That was the highlight at the 2018 edition of Hermann Loos passing out parade.
The 2018 Camp saw around 1500 Cadets representing 60 platoons, out of 2000 island-wide school level Cadet platoons participating in the final event. In addition, a representative group of foreign participants, including 60 Cadets and 15 Officers from India, Bangladesh, Maldives, Nepal, and Pakistan who are currently on a visit to the island are also present during the event at Rantembe.
That was the latter stage of the nineteenth century when the colonial masters were taking grounds in Ceylon. John B Cull, a British who held the chief position of Royal College, was keen in establishing a volunteer corps. His sole objective was instilling discipline among schoolchildren. Cull could breathe life to his brainchild in 1881 with the formation of a volunteer corps. The exercise became further fruitful with the introduction of a Cadet Battalion in 1902. More and more schoolchildren joined the Ceylon Light Infantry (CLI).
The Acting Commandant of the Volunteer Force was Major HG Morns, of the Duke of Cornwall Light Infantry. SM Burrows was tasked with handling Public Instruction which later became known as Education Director. Royal, S Thomas, Wesley, Kingswood, Trinity and Richmond Colleges have formulated companies. The honorary officers handpicked out of teachers and senior students commanded these companies. The Cadet Battalion of CLI was reorganized on September 1, 1910.
At the age of 16, a cadet will be eligible to join the Cadet Companies. They were commanded by officers seconded from the CLI. 1918 saw the expansion of the corps. Brigadier General RB Fell and Commandant CVF recommended the disbanding of the Cadet Companies and the formation of the Cadet Battalion with two divisions: seniors and juniors. As a result, Diyatalawa was set up in 1904 after the Boer War. The cadets attended camp together with Ceylon Planters Rife Corps (CPRC), CLI, British and Indian Regiments. In 1948 the Commanding Officer of the Ceylon Cadet Battalion (CCB) was appointed the Ceylonese Commandant of the Ceylon Defence Force. CCB became the Ceylon Cadet Corps (CCC) in 1950. In the same year, the second Battalion was formed with Headquarters in Kandy and 1st Battalion Headquarters shifted to Kalutara. Thus with its progress in 1953, the third Battalion was formed.
The Commandant and Deputy Commandant of the Sri Lanka Police Reserve held the appointments of Commandant and Dy. Commandant of the Police Cadet Corps. The Officers in charge of training and the permanent staff of the Corps were under a Reserve Superintendent of Police, who was responsible to the Dy. Commandant and Commandant. Membership as cadets was open to schoolchildren under 18. The officers were selected from those in the teaching profession in government schools. The Corps changed its designation as Sri Lanka Cadet Corps after Ceylon declared itself a Republic in 1972.
Later in 1981, the then Education, Youth Affairs and Employment Minister made a proposal to broad-base the Cadet Corps on a national basis under a central authority. Act No. 40 of 1985 brought about the amalgamation of the Sri Lanka Cadet Corps and the Police Cadet Corps under the Manpower Mobilization Ministry. The NCC was ceremonially inaugurated on April 29, 1988, under the patronage of President J R Jayewardene.
The National Cadet Corps now functions as a project under the purview of Defence Ministry. The Corps thus boasts a proud history of preparing youngsters for any situation and encourage active participation in local communities.
The National Cadet Corps currently consists of around 3000 officers who train 50000 cadets gathered from across the country.
National Cadet Corps milestones
In 1962, the CCC Officers were called upon to perform duties in Colombo Harbour with other units of the CVF and Regulars.
The fourth, fifth and sixth battalions were established in 1964, 1968 and 1970 respectively. 108 officers were mobilized for duties with the Regular Force in various parts of the country in 1971.
The Sri Lanka Police Cadet Corps was raised in July 1972 as a project sponsored by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Defence. The Corps functioned as an integral part of the Police Reserve.

New hormone kit will enable men to breastfeed
While having a child is special for a lot of people, men cant experience some aspects of parenthood due to certain limitations. But medical science has opened doors to a lot of possibilities over the past few years resulting in radical changes.
Now a new breakthrough promises to enable men to breastfeed and its inventor claims it will be available in five years. The hormone kit requires a man to take a cocktail of drugs in order to grow milk ducts by the time the child is born. While it hasnt been tested the side effects may cause men to grow breasts up to a B-cup size. The product is seen as an empathy tool which can enable men to help and support their partners who struggle to breastfeed.
The process would require a man to take hormone progestin from the day his partner discovers she is pregnant. In the last six weeks the man is required to take domperidone four times a day to stimulate production of prolactin. Prolactin is a hormone that makes a womans body produce breast milk.

Indian Ocean
Ocean of the future
The Indian Ocean Region has over the years gained significance due to many factors. This was evident during the recent conferences held in Colombo where significant attention was placed on this region.
The Galle Dialogue Synergising for Collaborative Maritime Management takes this thought forward to a much broader canvas. Therefore, the role played by the navies of these regions in protecting the Indian Ocean Region which is the worlds third-largest ocean, is crucial.
Addressing the Galle Dialogue in Colombo on October 22, Vice Admiral G. Ashok Kumar, Deputy Chief of Naval Staff of the Indian Navy remarked, The Indian Ocean Region is set to define the destiny of the planet in the 21st century and the Indian Ocean is increasingly being defined as the Ocean of the Future.
As the geo-strategic environment evolves in the region, he said it is the ability of countries to adapt to the emerging challenges that will decide the contours of the resultant geo-economic and geo-political landscape. He highlighted the fact that all countries in this region need to find ways to avoid conflicts, adding that one of the approaches to conflict avoidance is to make all stakeholders equal partners in the development process of this region.
Maritime security and non-state actors
In addition to these challenges, global terrorism continues to acquire new dimensions by the day. The reach, access to technology, organisational flexibility and financing avenues that terrorist organisations enjoy today is unprecedented. India has been a victim of state-sponsored terrorism for many years now. Unfortunately, this threat has evolved faster than many of us anticipated and is no longer confined to a country or region. It has, in every sense, acquired a global reach and influence, said Vice Admiral Kumar.
Highlighting the numerous and unique challenges to security in our region and their intensity and complexity, he said that a worrying trend has been the proliferation of violent non-state actors and networks at sea, which harbours numerous challenges and demands a recalibrated outlook to collective maritime security.
Identifying maritime piracy and maritime terrorism as the two major ways in which non-state actors threaten to jeopardise the security of the maritime domain with a direct influence on land affairs, he noted, The collective manner in which the world responded to the piracy in Gulf of Aden bears testimony to the impact which we can have when we join hands to curb the menace of these non-state actors. I am sure, you would agree with me that the reduction in piracy incidents gives us a suitable example of what collective maritime security can achieve, thus embodying the true essence of collaborative maritime engagement.
The other threats and challenges in the maritime domain include drug running, arms and human trafficking and indeed poaching and fishing in the deep sea areas, which is a major threat and challenge in the waters around us. To counter any of these threats is a challenging task because non-state actors which operate these illegal activities have anonymity of identity and intent. They have transnational links and patronage, and at times, the money trails go across the oceans and across various countries, he said.
Vice Admiral Kumar emphasised the need, therefore, to move towards a much more secure maritime environment. However, he said that creating the level of assured and secure awareness required restoring the oceans around us to safe global commons which represents a significant challenge, particularly with respect to monitoring the vast ocean space. To bridge this informational gap, he said the Indian Navy is assisting partner states by setting up a Coastal Radar Surveillance System and mutual sharing of shipping information through a White Shipping Information Exchange Agreement which India has already concluded with 18 countries thus far and is in the process of expanding. The fused picture, available to all users as a result of this agreement, significantly enhances the Strategic Maritime Domain Awareness of the region.
Sri Lanka as a connecting point
More than 80 percent of the worlds seaborne trade in oil transits through the Indian Ocean choke points, making this region a vital one in global trade. Sri Lankas location in close proximity to the main sea lines of communication and marine transportation has given the country great importance as a connecting point.
Meanwhile, China also has great interest in this region which is manifested in their Belt and Road Initiative  the Maritime Silk Road which encompasses the Indo-Pacific with Chinese characteristics. In other words, China already has an Indo-Pacific strategy of distant economic, diplomatic and security engagement, perhaps more so than any other country. Chinas presence and stakes in the key Indian Ocean ports of Gwadar in Pakistan, Hambantota in Sri Lanka, and Djibouti, for instance, clearly show its interest in this region.
Addressing the Galle Dialogue under the theme Enhancing cooperation to open a new era of peace and stability in the Indian Ocean, PLA Navys Naval Command College (NCC) Commandant Rear Admiral Han Xiaohu urged all countries in the Indian Ocean Region to respect the diversity, colourfulness and differences of the region by ensuring equality, understanding, respect, and especially, by listening to the voices of the middle and small countries.
The Indian Ocean Region is full of development vitality and economic growth potential. In average age, the Indian Ocean has the youngest population of the world. Its coasts are highly populated and its development potential is enormous. The Indian Ocean is also the hot land of international economic cooperation, which greatly promotes the prosperity of the region, he said.
Highlighting the non-traditional security threats facing the Indian Ocean Region, Rear Admiral Xiaohu said, The non-traditional security threats in this region have a complex background, covering a vast area and are of great uncertainty. After the recovery of the ISIS-controlled area in the Middle East, the possibility of terrorist threats spreading in the direction of the sea is increasing, he said, emphasising the need to synergise world effort to construct a maritime joint defence line of counterterrorism.
Adding that no single country is capable of handling these security threats singlehandedly, he said enhancing mutual confidence, working collaboratively, and figuring out solutions jointly is vital. Therefore, China would like to join hands with regional and ex-regional countries to discuss extensively on maritime security topics, to contribute maritime security governance wisdom, to exchange counter-piracy experiences, to shoulder stability maintenance obligations, to provide financial support for security, and to jointly shoulder maritime security responsibility based on respect for the Indian Ocean regional countries core interests and great concerns.
China would like to work together with the international community to construct and maintain a free, open, inclusive and cooperative maritime order in the Indian Ocean through open and sincere talks, to make equitable, rational and inclusive maritime rules on the principles of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and basic principles of relevant international laws, to provide maritime public security products, perfect maritime security governance mechanisms, and solve maritime disputes peacefully through negotiations, he said.
Rear Admiral Xiaohu vowed his countrys support to Indian Ocean regional countries efforts to strengthen maritime security, including updating maritime force equipment, enhancing maritime situation awareness, improving maritime operation command and control efficiency, and building maritime emergency handling capacity. We support the international communitys initiative to promote peace and stability of the Indian Ocean, including pushing forward maritime information sharing, improving connectivity of maritime security facilities, and perfecting maritime operation coordination so as to effectively deal with all maritime security threats and challenges.
Collaborative management
Deliberating on his theme, Can the Indian Ocean be Collaboratively Managed First Admiral Anuar bin Mohamed, Assistant Chief of Staff  Human Resource, Royal Malaysian Navy said, by comparison, the Indian Ocean region consists of an area that is almost seven times the size of the United States. Bordering this ocean and the states around it is the 66,526 km coastline. In a nutshell, it covers 30 percent of the global ocean area which is home to 30 percent of the worlds population and 30 percent of the worlds coral reef cover.
This region provides various major sea routes that connect the Middle East, Africa, and East Asia with Europe and the Americas. A particular heavy traffic that carries petroleum and petroleum products from the oilfields of the Persian Gulf and the eastern Asian states goes through it and its bountiful resources of seafood have provided its bordering countries with seafood for domestic consumption and export, the First Admiral said.
However, this has also attracted fishing fleets especially from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan which come in droves to exploit its resources, mainly for shrimp and tuna, he said.
First Admiral Mohamed said 40 plus states border this ocean region and all of these states with diverse interests and capabilities shared all these ocean resources.
Not all of them, however, have the same level of technology or expertise when it comes to extraction and utilisation of resources. Moreover, most of these states are in the developing economy stage. It is a Catch 22 situation for many of these states when it comes to developments of resources in the Indian Ocean Region, let alone enforcement.
Therefore, he said this situation calls for aids from the states with money, as it would bank in the development, whilst domestic resources would roll the day-to-day need.
While the need to have collaborative approaches to deal with the issues facing the Indian Ocean Region is inevitable, collaboration cannot be fully achieved as long as there is great power politics that enhance the geopolitical and geostrategic struggles in the region.
As noted by First Admiral Anbar, India fears that the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) could have an impact on its margins of both land and maritime Asia. This project has challenged its hypothetical perception that it dominates the region. This is a major issue, a perceived status-quo change in the region where Pakistan is being perceived as revisionist by India.
Due to the great power politics of USA and China, the sub-regional struggle between India and Pakistan continued to be enhanced, he said. He said Australia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Africa, France and the United Kingdom were all vying for a role to play in the Indian Ocean Region. Even when it comes in varying degrees, the oceans demography will become very crowded. Some will be more active than the others, he said, warning that consequently, due to great power politics and sub-regional power struggles, it is doubtful if real collaboration in the region between states could be fully achieved.

AN OCTOBER REVOLUTION
As the Buddha and Heraclitus, to name but two of the greatest minds have said millennia ago, the only thing permanent is change. Change is of two sorts. One is gradual, evolutionary, incremental, with things remaining on a continuum. The other is ruptural, discontinuous, and dramatic. The first kind of change is quantitative. The other is qualitative. These two are not separated by a Chinese Wall. There is a transition from one to another. Ruptural, qualitative change is preceded by quantitative, gradual change. The signs and symptoms are always there to be read. The writing is always discernible on the wall, except for those who cannot or do not wish to see.
Political change, however dramatic, usually takes place through routine means of periodic election and according to the rules of the game. However, in any country, when the rules of the game are violated, for example, one party commences life as an unelected minority government, the majority in the Opposition is deprived of the official status and role of the Parliamentary Opposition and the post of Leader of the Opposition, elections are postponed etc., then the political game either moves outside the rules, or exceptional procedures embedded in the rules themselves kick in, just as there are emergency exits on an aeroplane.
Though it may or may not be traceable to Einstein, the saying that the definition of lunacy is to keep repeating the same thing while expecting a different result is a truism. If, 15 years ago, economic policies which hurt the living standards of the people and external, ethnic and security policies which affronted the national identity of a majority, combined to make a set of people deeply unpopular and vulnerable to intervention by the elected executive, and met with a disastrous end, a similar course of action 15 years later will inspire a similar outcomean outcome endorsed by the electorate 15 years ago and likely to be repeated 15 years later.
Executive presidency
A leader who is elected by the country as a whole always has greater and higher legitimacy than one who is elected on a far narrower, localized basis.
Everything has to be located within the prevailing system and understood systemically. The rules and norms of the Westminster system either do not operate or operate only in a limited sense, in a different system. In an executive presidency, however reformed and modified, the centre of gravity is the Presidency and the legislature, both upper and lower houses, have a different, subordinate relationship with the executive, which is located outside and above the legislature. The executive is relatively autonomous of the legislature. It is illogical and unproductive to seek to apply the logic of a Westminster system to a system in which the only leader, who is elected by the majority of the country taken as a whole, is the President who therefore is entrusted with executive power. In such a system it is the President who ultimately decides in an exceptional situation.
In some countries, the political system is Presidential and unipolar. In other countries the political system is Presidential but is multi-polar, with, however, the Presidency being hegemonic or dominant among the poles. The centre of gravity in a Westminster model is the Parliament. The centre of gravity in a presidential system is the Presidencywhich is why the system is called Presidential! While a Presidency after reform may not enjoy a quasi-monopoly or even be as dominant as it once was, it is still preponderant in terms of power.
All politics is, in the final analysis, a matter of state power, and state power is different from government power. In a presidential system, the elected executive is the principle wielder of state power.
Political change
State power is always politico-military, not purely a matter of legislative arithmetic. Mao may have overstated it a bit when he said All political power flows from the barrel of a gun, but as a philosopher, politico-military leader and poet, he got to the crux of things and expressed it pithily. What he said is essentially true even in a democracy insofar as the elected president is also the Minister of Defence and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.
While state power is always ultimately politico-military, political power in general always derives from and rests upon the people. The overwhelming weight of evidence of political change the world over proves irrefutably that a combination of economic policies which generate popular hardship while also hurting the national entrepreneurial class, political policies which cause or signal a retrenchment of the national state, external policies which cede control of national assets and/or territory to foreign powers or entities (Brussels in some cases, Geneva in others), taken together or in any permutation or combination, generates a social and national backlash leading to dramatic change.
Such changes almost always take place through or are endorsed at elections, resulting in the victory of populism, usually nationalist-populism, be it of the Left, Right, Centre, centre-left or centre-right. This global dynamic of contemporary history which goes back to Russia in the 1990s and the Russian peoples durable, repeated, continuing rejection of the economic liberalism (shock therapy) and West-appeasing policies of that decade, are unknown to or ignored only by the politically illiterate or ignorant, and they have obviously ignored it at their very considerable political peril.

Passara court premises lacking space
The litigants attending the Passara Magistrates Court said the space at the court premises is not enough since a part of the premises had been acquired for the Badulla-Chenkaladi main road expanding project.
They said even before the land was acquired, the litigants remained there with difficulty due to limited space. They are of the view that the government should provide or construct a building with ample space for a Magistrates Court.
According to them, the building had been constructed during the British rule and although the space was enough then, it is now too small for today's requirements.

PC polls: Election Commission Chairman seeks SC advice regarding measures
Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said that the Election Commission would seek the advice of the Supreme Court within the next three weeks to know the measures that could be taken by the Commission in order to conduct the Provincial Council elections.
He said that they do not have any powers to take a stance, therefore the commission has decided to seek the advice of the Supreme Court and added that the commission took the above decision as the public, media and several politicians started pointing the finger at the Commission for the delay in conducting the Provincial Council elections.
Deshapriya addressing the media yesterday at the Elections Commission, said that he had informed the political parties in writing and conducted several meetings on the need to conduct the elections as soon as possible.
Dictatorship and rule of administrative staff always go together and that he does not approve Provincial Councils being run by officials. Dictatorship and rule by administrative staff are like twins, he said.
He said that since April 2018 till 22 October, he has sent more than six letters to the party leaders copying it to the President and Prime Minister and added that he has taken all possible measures as the Chairman of the Elections Commission.
However, he said all the party leaders expressed their displeasure over postponing of provincial council elections and added that he requested them to respect democracy and take necessary measures to conduct the elections. A five member review committee on the delimitation report headed by former Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe was appointed on 29th August and its due time ended yesterday, 29th October.
Deshapriya said that former Elections Commissioner Ananda Ratnayake who was in the committee had mentioned that nothing effective was discussed and as a result a report based on it cannot be submitted and added that he would inform individually or as a group to the Speaker of the Parliament about it.
The commission is also planning to send a letter to the Speaker of Parliament informing that the due period has ended and no report has been made based on it, he said.
Deshapriya further said that there are only two options left, either the President has to gazette the old delimitation report (which was rejected by parliament members) or to postpone the amendments suggested to theAact and call for an election. Several amendments which were in theAct No.2 of 1988 was removed in the No 17 of the act 2007.
Therefore, these amendments have to be approved by Parliament, he said adding that again parliament that has to decide whether it needs a two third majority to pass it.

PC polls soon - President
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said that the Provincial Council elections will be held soon to strengthen democracy in the country.
The President was speaking at the Vap Magul ceremony held at the Sandagirigama Paddy field in Thissamaharamaya.
President Sirisena further said that officers of six provincial councils are in a helpless state due to lack of a precise political leadership or guidance. The officers can accomplish duties to a certain extent with the circulars, but there must be a peopleoriented political leadership that offers better services, he pointed out.
Hence, discussions will be held as soon as possible within tomorrow or the day after tomorrow with the Elections Commission about holding Provincial Council Elections, said the President.
President Sirisena said that immediate solutions will be provided to the problems of the people of the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
The President said that the people who held responsibilities failed to respond to the issues of the people of the North within the last three and a half years and further stated that the proposed housing projects for the people of North were only limited to mere Cabinet discussions.
He invited all the politicians, government officers, as well as Mahasangha and priests of other religions and all the citizens to join hands with the new government with a strong sense of friendship, brotherhood and peace to reduce the burden on the people for their struggle for living, achieve economic prosperity of the country, strengthen a well-disciplined governance and to move forward aligned with the local culture. President Sirisena further said that, even though there is a need for technology and the most updated knowledge of the world, Sri Lanka, as a nation which hails its local heritage, there should be an agriculture-based economic development program which aligns with the local food style and culture.
The President also symbolically distributed paddy seed and fruit plants to the farmer community.
The Mahasangha, priests of other religions, former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa, Mahinda Amaraweera, Shan Wijeylal Da Silva, Angajan Ramanthan, Cadar Masthan and other public representatives, and a large number of famers were present at the event.
Meanwhile, the Kidney Unit of the Base Hospital of Tissamaharama, Debarawewa was also opened by the President. The new dialysis unit and the laboratory were also observed by the President.

Pelwatte Dairy commissions Milk Powder Plant in Buttala
Sri Lankas 100% local dairy manufacturer, Pelwatte Dairy Industries Limited (PDIL) further expanded its operations by commissioning a new milk powder plant within its factory complex in Buttala recently.
Plant #03 commenced operations in May 2018 and has since increased PDILs daily raw milk inflow capacity to 300,000 litres.
Speaking on the opening of the new plant Managing Director of PDIL Akmal Wickramanayake said, Pelwatte Dairy was built on a vision of making Sri Lanka self-sufficient in milk as it was in the days gone by. We have made some great strides in reaching this goal over the years and this new plant adds a further dimension to it. Our aim is to not only benefit the consumer but also uplift the lives of the dairy farming community in Sri Lanka.
PDIL is a 100 % local company and produces its range of dairy products using only fresh milk that is collected from local farmers on a daily basis. With stringent quality control measures and no added preservatives, colours or flavouring in any of its range, PDIL has assured consumers of the goodness of its product range for many years.
Annually Sri Lanka imports over 90,000 tons of milk powder spending millions of rupees. We want to contribute to reducing these staggering numbers by at least 50% in the next few years and we strongly believe that we have the potential to do so, Wickramanayake added.
The opening of the new plant also raises the number of farmer families benefitted by PDILs attempts to 5,000. It has also created other job openings within the plant itself thereby uplifting the livelihoods of the Buttala area.
Further strengthening operations PDIL also made significant structural changes to its internal management at the beginning of this year. First quarter performances also reflected a sales increase of 20% in comparison to the previous year. Consumer confidence has also grown as the PDIL product range is expanded to include drinking yoghurt, flavoured yoghurt and a premium ice-cream range.

THE PENTAGON LOVES SAUDI ARABIA, IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH
The shocking allegations of Jamal Khashoggis killing and dismemberment in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul have led to a rare open debate among politicians, pundits, and business leaders about the strategic wisdom of U.S.-Saudi relations. When the debate subsides, however, its unlikely to have transformed Americas long-standing relationship with Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf kingdoms regional allies, in any substantial way.
The reason is simple: geographymore specifically, the U.S. militarys peculiar relationship to it. For decades, the United States has professed several vital (and lesser) national interests in the Middle East. These interests include assuring the free flow of oil and natural gas, preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, preventing the emergence of ungoverned areas that terrorist organisations can utilize, containing Iran, and enhancing the capacity of regional militaries to defend their own territory.
American political and military officials have consistently contended that the military should have the predominant role in achieving these interests. And, to ensure that military forces and assets can operate with sufficient latitude in the region to achieve said interests, those forces need reliable and predictable access to the airfields, ports, facilities, and airspace located on the sovereign territory of Persian Gulf countries. Cyber-capabilities or smaller, less-lethal units operating from naval assets in international waters are not an adequate or reliable substitute. Across Democratic and Republican administrations, direct and stable military access to the Middle East has been a far higher foreign-policy priority than any competing moral or ethical consideration in the region.
Regional alliances
This is the conclusion I reached over the past year researching U.S. military policy in the Middle East, the results of which were recently published by Chatham House. This included speaking with dozens of current and former military officials, diplomats, and executives from contractors that provide security services to regional militaries. I also reviewed the best publicly available information from government and nongovernmental sources, compiled data on U.S. military deployments and security cooperation programmes, and applied the latest academic findings on the measurable impact of deployments and operations.
My central finding was that the United States regional alliances consisted of a relatively simple exchange: Washington provides security cooperation, weapons, and logistical support, and in return, regional governments offer assured access to their territory for the U.S. military. This might seem unsurprisingbut the biggest revelation of my conversations was the depth, breadth, and scope of this reciprocal relationship. It isnt simply transactional and temporary, but built upon decades of close personal contacts between U.S. military leaders and their regional interlocutors. These relationships extend beyond the Americans active-duty service and have allowed Middle Eastern governing regimes to receive a pass from human and political rights concerns. To some extent, the relationships now exist to serve themselves, rather than U.S. interests.
Security cooperation programmes are the routine touch points between U.S. military forces (and contractors) and their Middle East counterparts. For example, in 2017, 9,007 officers from Middle East countries received instructionon subjects including tactical combat skills and civil-military relationsat Defence Department educational institutions, primarily within the United States. Weapons and munitions sales are also an enormous and visible element of Washingtons collaboration with regional militaries.
For two decades, the United States has been the largest weapons exporter to the Middle East, and from 2013 to 2017, 49 percent of all U.S. weapons by value went to countries in the region. Security cooperation also includes numerous examples of U.S. logistical and analytical aid for operations conducted by local militaries: Americas expedited munitions and fuel shipments to Israel five days into its war against Hezbollah in 2006, a joint surveillance and intelligence cell to support Turkish airstrikes against forces associated with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in northern Iraq, and, most notoriously, the combat search and rescue, in-air refueling, and intelligence analysis that the U.S. military has provided to the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen.
U.S. military policy
There are also less-recognized, informal cooperation activities that retired military officers provide to Middle East governments. After stepping down as the commander of U.S. Central Command, now-Secretary of Defence James Mattis, while also on the board of directors for defense contractor General Dynamics, served as an unpaid military advisor to the United Arab Emirates, from June 2015 until August 2016. Retired Gen. James Jones worked at Ironhand Security LLC with the Saudi Ministry of Defence, while retired Maj. Gen. Thomas Moore Jr. consulted for Stark Aerospace Business Development, based in Israel. More shocking is Stephen Toumajan, who retired from the U.S. Army as a lieutenant colonel in 2007 and is now a two-star general within the UAE militarys Joint Aviation Command. These activities enhance the capacity of local security services, which, in turn, enables and sustains the close relations that reliably permit U.S. military access.
As a result, U.S. military policy is not based on any objective evaluation but is immensely influenced by regional governments. These distortions are intensified by U.S. public relations firms. These firms arrange meetings to represent the interests of regional governments with members of Congress, administration officials, research fellows at think tanks, editorial boards, journalists, corporate executives, and any other influencer. (Trust me, if you publish columns that run counter to the perceptions they seek to promote, these firms will reach out directly and repeatedly in an effort to change your mind.) As of June, according to the Foreign Agents Registration Act website, Saudi Arabia was being represented within the United States by 28 PR firms; Qatar, 24; the UAE, 16; Iraq, 15 firms and individuals; Israel, seven; and Egypt, three. - Foreign Policy

PepsiCo to pump in us $5 mn. to promote sustainable farming in India

Snacks and beverages major PepsiCo plans to invest $5 million by 2020 to expand its sustainable farming programme in India. The company  which is the biggest buyer of chip-grade potato in the country  also plans to double its collaborative farming network for potato cultivation in India in the next five years.
Christine Daugherty, Global Vice-President, Sustainable Agriculture, PepsiCo, told BusinessLine: As part of PepsiCos Performance with Purpose Vision, sourcing our agricultural ingredients sustainably is important for the growth of our business, food safety and to support crop resilience for continued and localised supply. India clearly is an integral part of our sustainable sourcing agenda.
As part of our continued commitment, we plan to invest $5 million by 2020, for expanding the Sustainable Farming Programme in India, she added.
PepsiCo is working with over 24,000 farmers in India, mainly potato farmers. Under its collaborative farming initiative, it is working directly with potato farmers across 11 States and will double this network in the next five years.
On the Sustainable Farming Programme in India, Daugherty said, We want to make a global impact which is locally relevant through our sustainable farming programme. We know we cant just come in with complete Western agricultural practices as they may not work in India.
So, our programme goes in and does risk analysis and assessment of environmental, social and economic factors. Post that risk assessment, we decide on how to engage with the farmers so they can grow better quality produce with less input costs which are resilient to environmental and economic shocks.
Through the Sustainable Farming Programme, the company provides education on field agronomy, fertilisers, irrigation, plant protection techniques to enable farmers to adopt best practices depending on the crops and local conditions.
PepsiCo is also leveraging on its mini-tuber lab in Punjab to export potato plantlings (mini-tubers) to be able to grow quality chip-grade potatoes in some other countries. We export potato mini-tubers to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey and Russia from our Punjab lab, she added.
As part of the sustainable farming practices programmes, the company has developed 33 model farms to educate farmers.
One of the initiatives we focus on is developing model or demonstration farms. These demonstration or model farms give farmers in the community an opportunity to experience and understand the best practices and advanced irrigation and crop management techniques, she added.
Replying to a query on the issues of climate change and agriculture, Daugherty said, We are engaging with farmers and other partners to look at ways to reduce carbon emission in agriculture. Precision agriculture techniques, farm management practices, inter-cropping and rotational cropping methods are some of the ways to address this issue.
For the farmers, it needs to be of business value in terms of increasing soil health, improving yields, reducing input costs and betterring the quality of produce, and that will encourage them to adopt the best practices.
According to its Performance with Purpose commitment, the companys global goal is to reduce absolute GHG emissions by at least 20 per cent by 2030 across its value chain.

Actress Jacqueline Fernandez has come out in support of the #MeToo movement.
Its very important to remember that the gender dialogue is a conversation thats a long overdue and lets not limit it to our film industry. Its a dialogue which has been long overdue in our society as well. Unfortunately, the sad truth is sexual predators are all around us, she told media after walking the ramp for the clothing brand Jade on its 10th anniversary along with singer Kanika Kapoor.
[Predators] are sometimes in our own household, so we should not deviate from the actual issue which is not entirely about sex but its about the power struggle. We really have to stick to the issue and be serious about it if we want solutions and if we want to have safe workplace for everyone and for society.
Reacting to the #MeToo movement in India, Kapoor said: I am very shocked about it. I feel very sad for anybody whoever has gone through any sort of sexual assault or misbehaviour. I am really happy that India is becoming a safer place with every passing minute and I really support this movement.
She says that from now on, people will not mess with anybody be it a girl, a boy or a kid.

Legal luminary says
President Sirisena acted constitutionally and practically
It is very clear that President Maithripala Sirisena, in his appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister, replacing former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, has acted constitutionally and practically, said prominent Political Analyst, Presidents Counsel Dr. Jayatissa de Costa.
Speaking to the Daily News on the current political situation in the country, he called it a constitutional crisis. On the one hand, the President using his powers has removed Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister elected on August 15, 2015. Wickremesinghe did not have the required Parliament seats to form a single party government. He had only 85 seats out of the 225. Therefore, the UNP garnered the support of several other parties led by Patali Champika, Athuraliya Rathana Thera, the SLMC and others and formed the United national Front (UNF). Still they could not command an absolute majority and garnered only 106 seats. Hence, they formed the National Government together with the United Peoples Freedom Alliance UPFA.
He blamed the 19th Amendment to the Constitution for the current predicament, claiming that it was hastily drafted and called it a constitutional disaster. What was promulgated as the 19th Amendment is a recipe for disaster, he said, adding that however, the country must run. Dr. Costa noted that the country is now under a Presidential Government and still governed by the 1978 Constitution. He said the most important power that the President had was the power to dissolve parliament one year after en election was held. This provision was used by then President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga to remove Ranil Wickremesinghe. But, the current President, Maithripala Sirisena does not have this power under the 19th Amendment.
Now what the President has done is to use his power under article 42 (4) of the Constitution. It says, The President shall appoint as Prime Minister, a member of parliament who, in his opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of parliament. In the context, with regard to Mahinda Rajapaksa or Ranil Wickremesinghe, the voters opinion is not relevant as it a matter of Parliament. This is purely based on the Presidents opinion. There is no yardstick to measure or gauge the popularity of the two. As Ranil Wickremesinghe led UNP had only 82 seats out of 225 and as a coalition the UNF obtained just 106 of the 225 and they still could not command an absolute majority.
Therefore, Dr. Costa pointed out that the UNF joined the UPFA and had formed the National Government. When the UPFA decided to leave the National Government, it collapsed. Now it is the Presidents opinion that matters.
He said that it is irrelevant if anyone brings in a No Confidence motion or defeats the budget. In terms of Opinion there is no hard and fast rule whether Parliament will rule or not. No one can challenge or interpret the Presidents opinion and only the President can decide. Hence, I think this decision taken by the President is in accordance with the Constitution. A similar incident happened in Pakistan in the case Asma Jilani Vs the Govt. of the Punjab over the awarding of military degrees.
The judges of the Supreme Court had to decide and they used the doctrine of necessity. Similarly, when Ian Smith declared independence in the state of Rhodesia (modern Zimbabwe) the international community rejected it, but gradually accepted it. Now the government under the Presidency of Maithripala Sirisena and Premiership of Mahinda Rajapaksa has been accepted already by several countries and others would soon follow. In addition, all the Governors of the nine provinces have also accepted the new government under the combination of Sirisena and Rajapaksa. This is the only effective government at present. Hence, the above doctrines are applicable here, Dr. de Costa noted. He pointed out that the alleged plot to assassinate President Sirisena and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa may or may not be true. But he said, nonetheless arrests have been made.
The crime rate in the country is high and there is a definite need for stability. Hence, we need to resort to these measures in order to save the nation. Some may argue that parliamentary majority is required. But, the fact is that in the 2015 elections no one commanded absolute majority. So, how can a leader who only holds 85 seats of the 225, claim that he has the majority in Parliament Pointing to the recent Local Government elections, he said the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna had swept the boards across the country and they clearly won the election.
Hence, the SLFP and the SLPP together would far exceed over 50% even at a General election.
This combination is adequate, he said, adding that it is clear that the President had exercised his powers in this instance in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and in a practical sense.

Real life magic book
Fantasy fans will know that an enchanted spell book is a powerful tool that can hold the arcane secrets of mythical worlds. Whether you believe in magic or not, its hard to avoid the allure of a magic book, full of glowing pages, riddles, mystery, and folktales. Although the image of these bewitching volumes often only reside in the imagination, Japanese experimental artist Uka Ohashi has conjured her own real life version, featuring letters that illuminate as you turn the pages.
The art and design student created her extraordinary magic book as part of a class assignment based on a novel that she wrote. The concept was to incorporate glowing letters throughout the book that shine brighter as the reader gets closer to the dazzling conclusion. Ohashi cut out each Japanese character using a laser cutter before binding the pages together into a book with an LED strip glued to the spine. When activated, the LED light shines through the cutouts, creating the illusion of the magical, glowing characters.

A recipe for stability
As the nation was emerging out of the aftershocks of the political tsunami last Friday, the revelations by President Maithripala Sirisena, in his Address to the Nation on Sunday would have jolted the nation further. In the light of this expose, the people have wholeheartedly welcomed the change orchestrated by the President.
Giving reasons for the sacking of former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the President revealed a gamut of serious lapses on the part of the ex-Premier that took the country downhill economically which if allowed to continue in the same vein would certainly have plunged the country into a major crisis.
To begin with, the President revealed that Wickremesinghe was in gross violation of the tenets and principles of good governance, contrary to the aspirations of 6.2 million people and that critical decisions pertaining to the economy were taken by an elite cabal who did not know the pulse of the common man. However what was underlined in the address was the monumental corruption and the cavalier manner in which decisions were taken that affected the economy.
The President did not fail to touch on the scandalous Central Bank bond scam and blamed Wickremesinghe for appointing his pal Arjuna Mahendran to head the country's economic nerve centre and the subsequent efforts to thwart the investigations into the biggest fraud that ever took place in this country.
The President said after forming the Government in January 2015, former Prime Minister Wickremesinghe arrogantly and stubbornly avoided collective decisions. This behaviour led to many conflicts. Due to his lack of collective decision making through discussions, the country had to face harsh consequences when he (Wickremesinghe) used to take decisions with a group of his very close associates. The plot to assassinate him, it appears, was the last straw that broke the camel's back and compelled President Sirisena to swear in former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister.
Here too President Sirisena revealed attempts to dilute the investigation following revelations that a Cabinet Minister of the former regime was involved in the plot. There were instances of some responsible officers in the Attorney General's Department evading investigation duties, he revealed.
Under these political problems, economic troubles and the strong plot to assassinate me, the only alternative open to me was to invite former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and appoint him as Prime Minister to form a new Government," the President asserted.
From the point of view of governance, it appears that stability has returned to the country. The main problem that the President had with Wickremesinghe was the divergent views and irreconcilable differences between the duo on a range of vital issues such the way the economy was handled, and, more importantly, consideration towards the ordinary public and public welfare.
In the latter sphere Wickremesinghe was found wanting since he viewed all things from a macro-economic perspective resulting in the public being left in the lurch. Even the February 10 warning delivered by the voters, which was alluded to by the President, appeared to have no impact on the former Prime Minister who went on talking about economic theories and concepts which were completely alien to the common man whose immediate concern was daily survival.
Politically too both were on contrasting wavelengths so to speak, with the UNP policies not in sync with the those of the left oriented SLFP/UPFA, with the former taking a wholly global outlook and the latter giving priority to indigenous concepts.
This gulf, no doubt, will now be bridged, with both the President and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa speaking the same language, on all these fronts. Both can now work in concert on many of the issues that the President did not see eye to eye with Wickremesinghe. Added to this, with a Cabinet comprising solely SLFP/UPFA Ministers everything is bound to fall into place.
We say this because under Yahapalanaya, Ministers from the UNP and SLFP were at odds on many issues and clashed openly in public exacerbating the state of instability in the Government. This, no doubt, would have led to confusion among would be investors at a time the country's foreign exchange problems had aggravated and the rupee taken an unprecedented tumble.
However, the President should be mindful of the current situation and take measures to arrest the tensions sweeping many sectors following Friday's dramatic events. Some of the Ministry buildings have been sealed and clashes between rival trade unions in Government institutions have contributed to the unrest. Incidents such as the one which occurred at a CPC depot in Dematagoda on Monday, where one person was killed, should be avoided. The new Cabinet was yet to be sworn as this is being written. The sooner all Ministries start functioning therefore will help fill the hiatus.
Unruly behaviour of trade unionists in government offices where supporters of rival political parties are being targeted should also be reined in and stability restored on all fronts for the new Government to commence business in earnest.

The article that appeared in the Daily News of Monday October 22, 2018, under the caption ARCHBISHOP OF COLOMBO IS NOT THE HEAD OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN SRI LANKA, is lacking from the total truth, according to the teachings and practices of the Catholic Church. Therefore it can mislead the readers of this esteemed daily.
Rev. Fr. Elmo Dias
While explaining well the role and authority of a bishop in his own Diocese, which is the territory under a bishops jurisdiction, the writer has ignored certain important traditions and the teachings of Canon Law regarding the authority and duties of a Metropolitan Archbishop, in relation to other suffragan dioceses coming under his care.
In the Latin Church, Metropolitan is the bishop of the principal (the metropolitan) see of an ecclesiastical province composed of several dioceses.
The metropolitan receives a pallium (a woollen vestment consisting of a narrow circular band placed round the shoulders with a short lappet hanging from front and back) from the pope as a symbol of his office. The metropolitan archbishop has certain oversight authority over the suffragan dioceses in his province.
According to the Canon Law of the Catholic Church (Nos.435-437), an ecclesiastical province which is presided over by a Metropolitan Archbishop is given certain duties and responsibilities over the suffragan dioceses, i.e. i) To oversee that faith and ecclesiastical discipline are carefully observed and notify the Roman Pontiff if there be any abuses. ii) For a reason approved beforehand by the Apostolic See, to conduct a canonical visitation, if the suffragan Bishop has neglected it. iii) To appoint a diocesan administrator in accordance with canon law provisions in certain circumstances.
Then a Metropolitan can be given special function by the Apostolic See, where circumstances require it. However, in day today administration of asuffragan diocese, he has no other power of governance over them.
In Sri Lanka there is only one Metropolitan Archdiocese, at the moment and that is the Archdiocese of Colombo. All other dioceses in Sri Lanka are suffragans of the Metropolitan of Colombo. Sri Lanka is still one ecclesiastical province, coming under the Metropolitan Archbishop of Colombo.
The word Bishop comes from the Greek word episkopos original meaning of which is overseer. Therefore the metropolitan, is an archbishop who governs his own archdiocese, and also supervises all the other bishops in his archiepiscopal province.Yethe is the first among equals in relation to the suffragan bishops. Thats why he is considered the spiritual leader of the territory he oversees. One must not forget that more than half the catholic population (that is close to 700,000 catholic population) of Sri Lanka is in the Archdiocese which is the Western Province in the government administration.
As for the Bishops Conference it is grouping of all Bishops in the country and it is guided by its own constitution approved by the Holy See.Canon Law describes an episcopal conference as a permanent institution and as a grouping [coetus] of bishops of a given nation or territory whereby, according to the norm of law, they jointly exercise certain pastoral functions on behalf of the Christian faithful of their territory. (canon 447).
This I hope will give a clear picture of the ecclesiastical seniority according to the protocol of the Catholic Church as to who really is the head of the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka.

Soaring notes
Unassuming and talented Ridma Dhananjaya Weerawardena has forged warm relationships in his life. This coupled with his talent for singing has given him a solid foundation. Melodies features Weerawardena who is courageous enough to be himself.
I think one reason that I have got to where I am now is because of the company I keep. I have surrounded myself with amazing people who have stood by me. They are positive and we are all on the same page. I am also a patient person who is tolerant and appreciative when it comes to those who are closet to me. This is the reason I think I have done well in the industry. This is where I have got my optimism, said Weerawardena.
Weerawardena is never afraid to be unique. He is an individual who delves into areas of music that has allowed him to come up with diverse and original creations. He calls his music  Experimental. One reason people listen to his music is the fact that he is an artiste who has a flair for originality.
One other reason that he is in the industry is because of the healing power of music. All music can heal and that is the amazing thing about it. Steven Tyler is best known as the lead singer of the Boston-based rock band Aerosmith, in which he also plays the harmonica, piano, and percussion. He is known as the "Demon of Screaming '"due to his high screams and his wide vocal range. Even this can heal! The Demon of Screaming can also heal. So can Bon Jovi and so can Madonna. Music is a totally personal thing and works differently for everyone.
I love the fact that music heals. It lifts you up and through the music I am healed and I am able to heal those who listen to me music. Music has always been a part of society because of this healing aspect, said Weerawardena
Weerawardena does covers mainly in in Hindi or Tamil. He already has seven originals. Stepping out of the comfort zone is never an issue for this young man. He was born to step out of his comfort zone. His is all about being himself. His first music video for the song Soya Awa is a good example of this.
Weerawardena as mentioned before is never in a rush. He maintains his composure. He is calm in the face of any occurrence. He understands that every finger in the hand in different. He believes that to create something beautiful you need to be yourself and not a copy of someone else.
I have big plans ahead. I just finished a Tamil original track. I am hoping to release it soon. Indian music inspires me. My message to anyone who wants to do music or even for that matter anyone who wants to succeed in life is that patience is the key. Everyone's pace is different, so take your time. And also focus on making an honest production that you'd enjoy yourself rather than try hard to make a hit song, explains Weerawardena
He has met his share of challenges in life. Music is not a field that many consider safe in Sri Lanka. Yet nothing could stop him from pursuing his calling in life. He knows who he is now. He knows what he wants. And he is doing well.
Music isn't considered a viable career in certain sections of society but as something that could be done as a passion/hobby rather than professionally. This was something that restricted me in many forms, mostly mentally, added Weerawardena
Warm relationships have sustained him through his life. He is inspired by those who genuinely care for him. He is honest to others and more importantly honest to himself. And he has no intention of stopping his remarkable journey in life
My beloved friend Imran, who is no more, was the one who convinced me of my true potential. I owe a lot to him. He was, is and will always be an inspiration. Internationally I am inspired by A R Rahman, for simply being an arthouse of talent with his diversity. Locally I am inspired by Amarasiri Peiris, for that mesmerizing voice of his, said Weerawardena.
Weerawardena calls himself a relaxed and chilled person. He is a man who is at ease with the world. He has many accomplishments and the future is bright for him.
Well the few shows I did with Wayo were probably the best. Special Thanks to Sangeeth Wijesuriya of Wayo for giving a newcomer like me a platform to perform my own songs on stage for the first time. Performing at a wedding in India, singing in Hindi made me very happy and. Recording the first few songs was a nice memory. I think my journey has been a result of team work. I'd wish to thank Charitha Attalage and Ranil Goonawardena for giving their best, and all the lyricists, mainly Chandrasena Thalangama for beautiful words and my family and all my well- wishers. Thank you for welcoming me, said Weerawardena.

Williams shares the inspiration  behind her  new album
It took 62 years to finally crown a black Miss America, in 1983. But after 20-year-old Vanessa Williams, daughter of two music teachers from the Bronx, earned her tiara, she was stripped of her title months later when unauthorized nude photos of her surfaced in Penthouse magazine.
Williams showed resilience and determination, relying on her natural beauty and talent to guide her to three Emmy nominations for her work on the sitcom Ugly Betty, 11 Grammy nominations for singles like Save the Best for Last, as well as a Tony nod and a best song Oscar, Golden Globe and Grammy for her single Colors of the Wind from Disneys Pocahontas, which she will sing October 12 and 13 at Segerstrom Center for the Arts.
he new album is my American songbook. These are all the songs that have been pivotal in my life. A song called Being Good Isnt Good Enough  I originally learned it in performance class when I was a musical theater major at Syracuse University, and I sang it for the Miss Syracuse Pageant and ended up winning that. And I sang it again for Miss New York State in July, and I ended up winning Miss America within six months. Theyre all songs that have to do with pivotal points in my life. And there are also a couple of new songs that will be on there as well.
I went in years ago for the voice of Nala in The Lion King. And I met the artists and they knew I could sing. And the agent called me back after I had met with everyone. The powers that be said Im not Disney material. And years later, my same agent and manager tell me that I have an offer to sing the theme song of Pocahontas, Colors of the Wind. So, its a lesson about not giving up hope. Everyone is judged in life, but you have to overcome it and you have to be patient. And hopefully, one day youll get a chance to get your opportunity to shine, she said. The OCR
