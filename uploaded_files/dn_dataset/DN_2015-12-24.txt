Drone helps icebreaker navigate treacherous Antarctic
AUSTRALIA: Australia's flagship icebreaker has for the first time used drone technology to navigate treacherous Antarctic waters, overcoming significant technical hurdles, officials said Wednesday.
The Aurora Australis is on an annual resupply voyage to Australia's Casey research station with images of sea-ice conditions from the quadcopper drone helping navigation decisions.
The Australian Antarctic Division said the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was proving to be a valuable addition to the current suite of sea-ice navigation tools, which include satellite imagery and radar.
But it has not been plain sailing in the sub-zero conditions. "The electronics do not like snow, the batteries do not like the cold, and the drone's compass did not like the ship's thousands of tonnes of steel," Australian UAV director James Rennie said.
"Because the compass couldn't calibrate on the ship and its need to work alongside the unit's GPS, there was potential for the UAV to behave unpredictably.
"We found that by disabling the GPS and flying the drone in full manual mode enabled the drone to operate successfully and deliver the required footage." The drone carried out five missions during the nine-day voyage to Casey, with a decision on its more permanent use for navigation to be made after a review of the inaugural flights.
Australia has four stations in the Antarctic wilderness and Aurora Australis has already made a resupply run to its Davis outpost. It is also scheduled to visit Mawson and Macquarie Island, delivering fuel, supplies and expeditioners for the year ahead.

## Title: IS lost 14 percent of its territory in 2015

IS lost 14 percent of its territory in 2015
UK: The Islamic State (IS) group lost around 14 per cent of its territory in 2015, while Syria's Kurds almost tripled the land they control, thinktank IHS Jane's said on Monday.
The development is a blow to the group given that its aim is to capture and hold territory to expand its so-called "caliphate", where it imposes a severe and bloody form of what it calls Islamic law.
The jihadist group's losses include the strategically important town of Tal Abyad on Syria's border with Turkey, the Iraqi city of Tikrit, and Iraq's Baiji refinery.
Other big losses for the group include a stretch of highway between its Syrian stronghold Raqa and Mosul in northern Iraq, complicating supply lines.
"We had already seen a negative financial impact on the Islamic State due to the loss of control of the Tal Abyad border crossing prior to the recent intensification of air strikes against the group's oil production capacity," said Columb Strack, IHS senior Middle East analyst.
The US-based thinktank said the group's territory had shrunk 12,800 square kilometres to 78,000 square km between the start of the year and December 14.
However, IS has made some high-profile gains during the year, including the historic Syrian town of Palmyra and the city centre of Ramadi, the provincial capital of Anbar, Iraq's largest province.
IHS said those victories came at the expense of the group's northern territories, which have been fiercely contested by Kurdish fighters.
Lands under Syrian Kurdish control jumped 186 percent over the year, IHS said.
"This indicates that the Islamic State was overstretched, and also that holding Kurdish territory is considered to be of lesser importance than expelling the Syrian and Iraqi governments from traditionally Sunni lands," Strack said.
"The Kurds appear to be primarily an obstruction to the Islamic State, rather than an objective in themselves."
Syrian Kurdish fighters dominate a group called the Syrian Democratic Forces, a coalition of Kurdish and Arab fighters battling jihadists in northeastern Syria that has risen in prominence in recent months.
IS has also been beaten back by US-led coalition airstrikes, Iraqi forces and Syrian rebels.
Iraq's government managed to claw back some six percent of its territory from IS in the past year, while Iraqi Kurds regained two percent of their lands.
The biggest territorial loser among the main actors in the Syrian conflict was the Syrian government, which lost 16 per cent and is now left with around 30,000 square km, less than half the area controlled by IS and a fraction of Syria's total area of about 185,000 square km.

## Title: Philippines becomes first Asian country to clear dengue vaccine

Philippines becomes first Asian country to clear dengue vaccine
PHILIPPINES: The Philippines became the first Asian country on Tuesday to approve the sale of the world's first-ever dengue vaccine.
Dengvaxia, manufactured by French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi, secured its first regulatory approval in Mexico a fortnight ago and is currently being reviewed by around 20 countries in Asia and Latin America.
It is hoped the drug could eventually help prevent millions of deaths from dengue, the world's fastest-growing mosquito-borne disease.
The World Health Organization says as many as 400 million people are infected worldwide every year, and two-thirds are in Asia.
"It's a major step in the prevention of dengue and for public health," Olivier Charmeil, head of Sanofi's vaccines division, said in a statement.
Scientists have long been stumped by dengue, which has four separate strains, forcing researchers to find a drug able to fight all of them at once.
Clinical tests -- carried out on 40,000 people from 15 countries -- have found Dengvaxia can immunise two-thirds of people aged nine years and older, rising to 93 percent for the more severe form of the disease, dengue haemorrhagic fever.
It was also found to reduce the risk of hospitalisation by 80 percent.
Dengue can trigger a crippling fever, along with muscle and joint pain. There is no known cure, and children are at particular risk.
The deadliest form of the disease kills 22,000 people a year, the WHO says.
It was once considered a disease of the tropics, endemic in only nine countries, but globalisation, urbanisation, climate change and jet travel are helping it to move into more temperate zones.
It is now endemic in more than 100 countries.
The WHO says cases have risen 30-fold over the last 50 years, with more than half the world's population potentially at risk.
Several million doses of the vaccine are ready to ship, and Sanofi expects annual production to reach 100 million doses by 2017.
Sanofi's research and development work took 20 years, costing more than 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion).
But the vaccine could bring the company more than $1 billion annually starting in 2018 or 2019, analysts said.
Other pharmaceutical companies are developing dengue vaccines, including US firm Merck, Japan's Takeda and Britain's GlaxoSmithKline, but Sanofi is ahead of the competition.

Potatoes to be grown on Earth under Martian conditions
US: Scientists plan to grow potatoes in Mars-like conditions simulated on Earth, in a major step towards building a controlled dome on the red planet capable of farming the invaluable crop.
The experiment, led by the International Potato Centre (CIP) in Peru and NASA in US, demonstrates that potato crops can be grown in the most inhospitable environments to save millions of lives.
The goal is to raise awareness of the incredible resilience of potatoes, and fund further research and farming in devastated areas across the globe where malnutrition and poverty are rife and climbing, researchers said.
"We need people to understand that if we can grow potatoes in extreme conditions like those on Mars, we can save lives on Earth," said Mr. Joel Ranck, CIP Head of Communications.
Currently, famine affects 842 million people around the world. Global warming creates poor soil conditions and increases the prevalence of pests and disease which have the combined effect of limiting harvests globally but particularly in vulnerable areas where poverty, malnutrition and food insecurity already exist.
Understanding atmospheric changes on the surface of Mars will help build more dynamic and accurate simulation centres on Earth, providing further research for both CIP and NASA, who are looking to pioneer space farming for future manned missions to other planets and moons in our solar system.
"I am excited to put potatoes on Mars and even more so that we can use a simulated Martian terrain so close to the area where potatoes originated," said Mr. Julio E Valdivia-Silva, SETI Researcher Associate of NASA, who is leading the project's science team.
By using soils almost identical to those found on Mars, sourced from the Pampas de La Joya Desert in Peru, researchers will replicate Martian atmospheric conditions in a laboratory and grow potatoes.
The increased levels of carbon dioxide will benefit the crop, whose yield is two to four times that of a regular grain crop under normal Earth conditions.
The Martian atmosphere is near 95 per cent carbon dioxide.

Santa Claus, out of the red, set to get more visitors
FINLAND: Santa Claus can expect a flood of visitors to his Lapland home in Finland over Christmas after a new owner cleared an outstanding tax bill, saving the company that runs him from bankruptcy.
A sharp drop in visitors from recession-hit Russia had suggested that Dianordia Oy, the company behind the Santa Claus Office attraction, might be forced out of business.
But since Lapland Safaris, which organises reindeer and snowmobile safaris, stepped in with a share-buy and rescue package last August bookings to visit Santa have surged, suggesting a bumper season this Christmas, tourist officials said.
Around 80,000 visitors are expected to visit the office in Rovaniemi, which declares itself Santa's official hometown, in the six week high season around Christmas, up from about 65,000 last year.
The attraction offers a chance to be photographed with Santa and is a central site of several Christmas-themed businesses in Rovaniemi. It had some 300,000 visitors overall last year and revenues of about 2 million euros ($2.18 million).
"It looks like the unpleasant incident turned into a boost and a very good season," Sanna Karkkainen, managing director in Rovaniemi Tourism and Marketing, said. "We lost some Russian travellers, something like 30 per cent in total. But we managed to get new customers from Asia, for example from China, Singapore, Australia, and Japan." The biggest European customers are Britons, Italians and French.
Lapland tourism is a rare bright spot in Finnish economy, which has contracted for three years in a row and is currently performing worse than any other euro zone country except Greece.

SLFP is bullet proof - Dilan
Attempts of some groups to shoot in the head and heart of Sri Lanka Freedom Party will become futile as the party is wearing bulletproof clothing, State Minister of Highways Dilan Perera said.
Perera said that certain elements in the UNP have undertaken the contract of destroying the SLFP. "Their dreams will never come to reality," he said.
Perera said that party supporters are aware of past calamities faced by the SLFP due to splits within the party.
"No one can destroy the party nor its unity," the state minister said.
He said that the SLFP Central Committee has already taken a decision to give nominations to the members of the Local Government bodies at the forthcoming Local Government election unless they are found guilty by a court of law.

World oil price drop should benefit people - JVP
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) yesterday urged the government to pass the benefit of fuel price reduction in the world market to the people.
JVP Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath said the government can provide a litre of petrol and diesel at Rs. 59.39 and Rs. 79 respectively even after adding taxes.
The crude oil prices have come down drastically in the world market but the government has failed to pass the benefits on the public, he said.
Herath said that people will receive relief with the reduction of oil prices. "The production cost and transport fare will reduce," he said. The JVP MP asked the government as to why it delays the introduction of price formula for the fuel prices.
Herath also said that his party opposes the decision to increase the allowance of Parliamentarians participating in parliament sessions to Rs.20,000.
"It is an additional burden on the people," he said. Herath said the government did not respond postively towards the farmers' demands. "Farmers demanded the restoration of their rights. The Prime Minister who is claiming that he is following the precepts of Lichachi evaded the meeting with farmers," he said
