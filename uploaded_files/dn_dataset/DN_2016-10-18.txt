Robinson Crusoe : Unimaginative
Daniel Defoes Robinson Crusoe is about the triumph of the human spirit. However the 2016 Belgian-French 3D computer-animated adventure comedy directed by Vincent Kesteloot and Ben Stassen does not embody this essence.
Published in 1719, the novel Robinson Crusoe was an instant best-seller, and ran through many editions. The book has lived for 297 years with no fallow period where it dropped into obscurity. This is an incredible feat for any novel. The book has sparked conversation and argument for centuries. Kesteloot and Stassens production is a loose adaption of the tale.
Targeted at children, especially pre schoolers, the movie includes plenty of colourful animals: dog, cats, a macaw and even an armadillo. No wonder it is titled The Wild Life and released in some parts of the world.
Exotic island
The story is narrated from the animals perspective rather than that of the lead role. Robinson Crusoes larger-than-life parrot voices the tale of the shipwrecked adventurer. His bird is not like your regular parakeet but dreams of exploring the world outside his exotic island. Named Tuesday, the brightly plumed macaw also attempts to fend off repeated attacks by a pair of nasty wildcats and their mangy litter.
The storyline does not hold much depth. A castaway finds himself on a tiny island with no other human inhabitants, after a rough start, he befriends the local animals and all hell breaks loose when the killer kittens enter the picture. Before Crusoes arrival, the island is an untouched paradise. The animals live together, gather food together, and get each other out of scrapes. The leader is Mak, a colorful parrot who senses a wide world is out there beyond the ocean and he wants to see it.
Everything about the film is pedestrian. There is nothing imaginative about it. At the same time there is nothing intelligent and interesting about the tale. The worse part is that there is nothing funny about it either. Even the animation in the movie is almost amateurish. The film also tries to pack in a little bit too much in its running time.
Skilled hands
The cats urge to dominate the island is a bit of a bore. This leads to a gigantic group fight later in the film. Crusoes animal-friends against the cat-couples endless offspring could have been played out better in more skilled hands.
Some of the colours used to paint the animals makes it a pretty picture to watch but that is probably the only positive element in the movie. Tiny tots might be amused with the tale but adults will find the story bland and the jokes weak. It is always a great shock when a production based on a beloved tale falls short of its mark but it remains badly told.
Robinson Crusoe is screening at Majestic Cineplex, Empire Arcade and Savoy 3D cinema.

At the core, Shivaay is an emotional film
Ajay Devgn is coming up with his magnum opus, Shivaay and he talks enthusiastically about his passion project which will release this Deepavali.
Q: What is the significance of the title, Shivaay
A: Shivaay is the name of my character, a mountaineer. He is a Shiv bhakt. When required he becomes a destroyer.
Q: What are the reactions based on the trailer
A: The reactions are same all over. I am extremely happy because this is the buzz not just in India but also abroad. Recently, in the US I met a few foreign technicians and directors and they were talking about it. They found the action outstanding. This is gratifying.
Q: Were you able to keep the film within budget
A: We have shot for 105 days and 50 percent of it has been action. But we were able to stay within the budget because we planned it well. People are saying that the film looks like a `150-160 crore affair. Thats not true. Generally, half of a films budget goes to the actor, director and other artistes, but here I have put all the money into production. There is no load on distributors either.
Q: What went into making Shivaay.
A: My entire team was so inspired. Otherwise, you cant even imagine making a film in minus 25-30 degrees in places where even food cant be reached. It was tough for the unit to reach the location and still they all stood by me throughout. It was my passion but they could have just given up. Butthey didnt.
Q: How big wasyour crew
A: There were around 350 people at all times ... even in the mountains. If you have to just shoot a song in the mountains then you can go with a crew of 60-70 people. But we had to shoot action and there was a lot of cable work and coordination needed. There were even more people on the road because we had so many cars in motion in every shot. As you can see, there are cars at every nook and corner of streets, so we had to deploy people to ensure that the scenes go off smoothly.
Q: Is it an actionfilm
A: At the core of it, Shivaay is an emotional drama. It has action but there is a connect with the characters You will see some of the best performances from everyone in the film.

There comes a point when you realize you've lost that passion and that hunger, frontman Caleb Followill told Billboard.com about their new sound.

Caleb previously revealed the new album will focus on personal experiences, including his model wife Lily Aldridge's experiences in a creepy Los Angeles hotel, and his own alcohol addiction, which forced him into rehab after the band scrapped a 2011 tour.

## Title: NELSON MENDIS THE COMPLETE COACH

NELSON MENDIS THE COMPLETE COACH

Nelson Mendis is the director of coaching at the CCC School of Cricket at Maitland Crescent since 1998.
His coaching career started at Dharmasoka College Ambalangoda in 1960 - later he moved to Nalanda in 1965, as the Junior Coach, when Gunapala Wickremaratne was the Principal. During this time apart from coaching junior cricketers, Mendis also had to train the cadets as the Officer in Charge of the contingent. He was the Junior Coach cum Master in Charge of the cricket teams of the college. He was also the Teacher in Charge of Discipline and was a Warden of the Hostel.
He served Nalanda College in two spells as he had to join the Teachers Training College in 1969 and later during the insurrection in 1971 he was mobilized in the Sri Lankan Army where he served for nearly five years as an English and Current Affairs instructor to the Army Officer Cadets at the Sri Lanka Military Academy Diyatalawa.
In his first spell from 1965 to 1969 he was able to coach guide, and produce Sri Lankan cricketers of the caliber of Bandula Warnapura, Anura de Silva, Lalith Kaluperuma, Sanath Kaluperuma, Sunil Jayasinghe, Jayantha Seneviratne, Anura Ranasinghe and Keerthi Ranasinghe.
Mendis rejoined Nalanda in 1975 and served till 1979. During this spell, the veteran coach recalls, that he was able to produce more national players like Roshan Mahanama, Asanka Gurusinha, Kumar Dharmasena, Gamini Wickremasinghe, Chamara Dunusinghe, late Roshan Gunaratne, Yohan Gunasekera, Hemantha Devapriya and Susantha Karunaratne.
Nelson Mendis had the unique distinction of bagging 5 wickets in 5 balls which is a record in Mercantile Cricket history. He took 3 wickets in the last three balls of one over and followed it up with 2 wickets in the first two balls of the next over. He represented Singer Sports Club and his opponents were Stafford Motors. In his era he represented Bloomfield, Badulla, Army and Old Sokians.
The Guru was full of praise for Anura de Silva, the complete cricketer. Nelson narrates an interesting story about the Nalanda team visiting St. Anthonys Katugastota on their annual 1st eleven encounter in the late sixties. Anura de Silva was the captain and when the train transporting the Nalanda cricketers reached the Kandy station, he was mobbed by all the Market johnnies of the Kandy market who were staunch supporters of the State religion. They were telling Anura putha, Anthonys eke evunta bada sudda wenna denna. From the station the team went to the College, where they were billed to stay. Once they were there some members of the team and a few others got permission from Nelson Mendis to go to a hosts get-together in Kandy town.
Afterwards they arrived at the college hall well past the curfew time of 8.00 pm. The following morning Anura de Silva was feeling a bit under the weather. By noon they were to start the match and Anura being the skipper was ready to go to toss. Nelson Mendis the strict disciplinarian recalls once again, that he prevented Anura from going to toss because he was feeling ill at the time, as a result Palitha Seneviratne went to toss and won, Nalanda elected to bat, late Wasantha Seneviratne (another prodigious talent who never fulfilled his intent due to circumstances beyond his control, he also was not related to Jayantha or Palitha) got out, and in walked Anura de Silva to a tremendous roar from the crowd , he settled into his element from the word go and hammered the Anthonian attack into smithereens . The end product was a glorious 137 runs. For reasons best known to them, the crowd who were not affiliated to St Anthonys went delirious and they strode out of the ground with pride. The occasion was rare for them as well as special. Not only did Anura shone with the bat, he performed well with the ball as well scalping five wickets. This stupendous performance enabled Nalanda to beat St Anthonys for the very first time. The veteran coach recalls that the wayward genius stamped his class in no uncertain terms.
Anura broke into the SSC enclave through sheer talent, but he was cold shouldered by the men who mattered at the time, in spite of that he scored a century in his first outing. The next match in their fixture was on a Saturday and the SSC dance was on the previous Friday. The most prominent figure in that era at the SSC was a grand old gentleman, who called his shots at will. He banned all the team players from going to the dance. Anura had the audacity to defy the ban and went and stayed till 12.30 a.m. the following day. He sauntered into the dressing room on Saturday morning to find out that he was made the 12th man, Anura was dumb-struck and he slung his kit bag over his shoulder and walked out disgusted and that ended a career of the most gifted Nalanda cricketer thus far. It was a pity that Sri Lanka lost another great who would have been as good as Aravinda de Silva, according to Nelson Mendis.
The latest feather in the cap of Nelson Mendis is the tour of England with the Sri Lankan under 19 cricket team recently, where they created history being the first under 19 team to win both the Test and ODI series against England. Nelson Mendis was the chef-de-mission of the tour party with Mahinda Halangoda as manager and Roy Dias as coach.
Nelson Mendis still coaches his charges at CCC School of Cricket six days of the week.
